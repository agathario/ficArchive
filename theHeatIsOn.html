     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Billy needs two participants for his final assignment. A game of Hot Ones where you'd either answer the question or bite into a sauce that was sure to burn your tastebuds off.  Agatha agrees to play, never one to deny Billy of needing help. Rio agrees as well, loving the game and idea of watching Agatha lose.
     </p>
     <p>
      The game should be simple, fun, but..when Agatha and Rio broke up two months ago and don't know they're playing against each other. On top of that, their friends have no idea they dated. Well, maybe Hot Ones wouldn't be so simple.
     </p>
     <p>
      ______
     </p>
     <p>
      AU one shot of these two being idiots, pretty much!

     <p>
      HELLOOOO, so- I've been wanting to do this one shot since Kathryn did hot ones and oh, I'm excited for it. It's obviously not accurate because well- The one shot would be boring in my opinion lolol. You'll see what I mean.
     </p>
     <p>
      I HOPE YOU LIKEEEE ITTTT HEHE

     “So, what the hell is this again?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s tone of voice was nothing out of the ordinary. Filled with its usual impatience that was ready to cut straight to the point. Billy barely blinked when she cut off his words to ask the question.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     However, her attitude was amplified this time around and the reason for it being stronger? She sat right across the table from her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Right on cue, Rio snickered. One that boiled Agatha’s anger even hotter. The woman snapped her head over, not wasting a second to spit a snippy,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what
     <em>
      exactly
     </em>
     is so funny,
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The younger one grinned, amused as she seemingly found the situation humorous. Luckily, Billy took over before Rio was able to reply.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Little did he know (For his own good) he just saved his own ass.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Well…for now.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had barely been in the same room as her ex-girlfriend for fifteen minutes and was already on the verge of flipping the table. Also, what didn’t help?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and her were the only two in the room to know they were exes. Fresh off a break up from two months ago and none of their friends knew. Their own little secret, treasure, something they originally planned to let be out in the open someday.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The break up happened before anything else ever could.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      God, this is a mess..
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Oblivious to the tension, Billy beamed as he spilled into a ramble.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, so! These cards here,” He held the stack up. “They have questions and you can shuffle, pick from the top, whichever way you want to do it. Soooo, when you ask Rio one of the questions, she either can answer, or! Take a bite of one of the wings with hot sauce on it”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded slowly as she scanned the items on the table. A few wings sitting on both trays, bottles of hot sauce lined up in a row to her right. Billy put the stack of index cards back between their trays, running off to make sure the camera was ready to go.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And suddenly, Agatha missed Billy’s presence within her reach. Even if he was only a few steps away, Agatha felt alone. She was trapped across the table from Rio who was too fixated on her phone to notice Agatha’s glare.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It had been two successful months without seeing her. Two months of slipping by, dodging questions from their friends on her whereabouts. Sixty three days of pure torture and survival. She thought being alone, trying to adjust to not having the annoying woman in her life was the worst part of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, sitting in front of her, taking in the sight of the woman who looked put together compared to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She was dressed in a tight top, an olive beige that was tucked against her skin. Agatha hated how her eyes wandered to her chest. It was clear Rio didn’t bother with a bra the way her nipples were nearly poking through the fabric. Jesus. That made Agatha’s throat close, the back of her mouth dry and drip with drool in the front at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Memories flooded her mind of how much she loved those tops. She vividly remembered tugging Rio by her waist into the closest secluded area. Rio’s little giggle echoed in her mind like a ghost. Her tongue could almost feel the fabric's texture when she used to press licks and kisses against each nipple.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Just pull the shirt off, Agatha”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio would whine while Agatha just hummed through a small laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Where’s the fun in that, dear?”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She’d ask and like clockwork, it always led to Rio tugging the roots of her hair. Her shirt would finally rise up at some point. Other times, she’d have to pull on one of Agatha’s jackets to hide the damp patches the woman left over the shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     “Oh! One more thing,” Billy clapped his hands, subtly making them both jump. “You can’t use the same hot sauce twice because each one after the first gets hotter and hotter”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up at him, raising her eyebrows with a low,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hotter and hotter?” She asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Rio didn’t waste a second to question her response.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She perked up in her seat, putting her phone down and wickedly grinning while Agatha returned her humor with a glare. However, the second their eyes met? Agatha regretted ever looking back over.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile was radiant. How her fingers (The ones Agatha still remembered and imagined while touching herself late at night) wiggled in the air, voice almost purring like a kitten as she taunted,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You scared of a little burn?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scrunched her nose, pursed her lips with a mocking tone,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Scared of a little burn?”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She rolled her eyes, lowering her voice back down to where it rested. Low, raspy, a graveling itch that scratches every syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. I’m not. Just like to make sure I understand the stupid shit that I for some reason agree to”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed, not bothering to continue their little banter as she looked back to her phone. Agatha wasn’t sure if she was thankful for it or not.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She crossed her arms, leaning back in her chair with her lips pulled back. Rio laughed to herself as she picked her phone back up, thumbs dancing across the keyboard.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Who is she texting?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Is she dating someone?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Why won’t she look at me?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      How is she so…put together?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The questions in Agatha’s mind were relentless to the point she barely heard Jen and Alice walk through the door. Warm greetings surrounded her. She tossed a low effort one over her shoulder to try and appear unphased. That was hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn’t supposed to be here. Agatha would not have ever agreed to this
     <em>
      shit
     </em>
     if she knew otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy had called Agatha that morning to help with his final assignment of the year. A video he'd upload to YouTube, some challenge or whatever- Agatha didn't know, let alone care. She just agreed to do anything that'd help Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Even with the amount of shit she gave the younger boy, there would always be a soft spot for him as if he was her own.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Though the second Agatha walked into the kitchen to find Rio and Billy laying out the wings with hot sauce bottles lined up- Agatha regretted ever meeting him to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     No. That wasn’t true. It was the other human Agatha regretted meeting more than anyone else.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Just when she was about to make an excuse, say how work called or she just wasn’t feeling good- Billy lit up like a Christmas tree. He shined bright, thanked Agatha endlessly and said the words,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “I owe you, big time”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And
     <em>
      oh
     </em>
     , he didn’t know how much he owed her. That was for sure.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn’t able to leave after that. She cursed the boy for creating his own home in her heart. But, at least it didn’t take up complete residency like Rio’s did. His presence never hurt like Rio’s either.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, Billy” Alice snickered. “You chose to most competitive duo out of all of us”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice had her arms crossed as she circled the table, smirking at the both of them with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s how I’m hoping my video gets the most attention” Billy chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, that warms my heart!” Rio smiled, hand over her chest while looking over at Agatha. “Doesn’t it warm your stone cold one too, Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The other woman didn’t give a reaction, just a monotone,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, just toasty”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you two will be feeling more than toasty by the end of this shit” Alice laughed. “I watch these videos on YouTube all the time and you’re both bound to be begging for mercy”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snickered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha is” She said. “But me? Oh. I won’t even be feeling the burn”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhm, sure” Agatha hummed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     To their friends, Agatha and Rio seemed like their typical selves. They always held a competitive streak when it came to games. There was a reason Lilia banned monopoly years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is Lilia not coming?” Jennifer asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Something about-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are we getting started or what?” Agatha cut Billy off.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The others looked confused for a moment, but brushed it off to be Agatha's impatience. It was
     <em>
      far
     </em>
     from that. Well, maybe a smidge. Agatha didn't want to be near Rio, after all. The sooner they got started, sooner Agatha could leave and maybe fly out of the country by nightfall.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Truthfully, Lilia was the only one out of their friend group to know why Agatha didn’t want to be near Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was the older woman who had found Agatha two months ago sobbing in her car late one night. She had insisted for her to follow, setting her up on the couch with a warm plate of food. Ever since that night, Agatha hadn’t left.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She worked from home and lived in Lilia’s living room. The only way that was possible was by opening up over what happened. Lilia would’ve never let her stay without talking through the situation that created the look of despair and sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “She- I-” Agatha had gasped, shaking her head. “She doesn’t love me like that..I thought-”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Wait, wait” Lilia rushed. “Who doesn’t love you like that? What do you mean?”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      The younger woman sniffled, bringing the back of her hand up to wipe the tears rolling down her cheeks. She looked down at her lap where Lilia’s cat snuggled in. A small Maine Coon named Priestess after the tarot card. Her fingers trailed through her soft fur, mumbling under her breath the bitter name that used to taste so sweet.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Rio..”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remembered giving the entire story that night. How Rio’s job had taken over her life. She was never home, always on the go and had a new friend that Agatha started to obsess was out to take her love.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to debunk Agatha’s fears, but ultimately- They had won. As strong, tough, confident and full of herself as Agatha came off, she was full of doubts.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     Years ago, when Agatha had fallen in love with Rio- She was convinced it was a hopeless love. Rio was too far out of her league, something above her reach to ever grab ahold of. Agatha spent years sitting by, watching Rio date and held no expectations of something more to ever happen.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     That all changed Christmas Eve nearly a year ago. Rio joked they were under a mistletoe, both drunk on red wine and too many candy canes to count. Agatha would never forget the joke she made. The one that wasn’t supposed to mean anything.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “What? Looking for an excuse to finally kiss me?”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The way Rio looked over was a way she never had before. Those brown orbs sparkled under the gold string of lights. A soft stare with a coat of nerves underneath.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, a tiny smile with the words that still didn’t feel real to this day.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Only for the last few years..yeah. Is this a good one?”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They were in their own world that night. Alone in the hallway while the others were all outside, bundled up around a fire.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Though the fire outside would never compare to the way Agatha burned the second their lips met. How Rio pushed her against the wall, held onto her for life and kissed her as if they’d never kiss again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha should’ve never doubted any piece of them after that night. After they left Lilia’s, Rio nearly raced through every red light and intersection to bring them back to her place. They hadn’t even stepped through the door before Rio was attacking her, devouring as if she was starved and Agatha was her last meal.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Not to mention, Agatha’s belongings were all packed by the end of that month and moved into Rio’s. They said it was a roommate situation since Agatha’s lease ended and other places were an outrageous amount for rent.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And why did they lie? Agatha’s stupid, embarrassing self doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t want their friends to ever be divided when (Never if. Agatha always waited for it as if Rio leaving was inevitable) everything crashed and burned. They were their own tiny family, after all. She didn't care how it’d look for Agatha to disappear, but she never wanted the drama or attention.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knew deep down Rio wasn’t a fan of it, but…Agatha feared the worst as always. Besides, one day the others would figure it out. Agatha didn't think they needed a grand ol’ announcement for the obvious.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Everything is good to go!” Billy beamed. “Are you both ready?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked, sitting up straight with a small two finger salute. Agatha rolled her eyes, waving her hand as she muttered a small,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whatever”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice counted down from five as Billy stood at the table with Agatha and Rio on both sides. He grinned wide, hands trembling as his voice shook just a smidge.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t be nervous. We can start over, not like this is live”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nudged him with a soft voice. One that made Agatha’s heart melt. Especially as Billy took a sigh of relief with a nod, whispering a soft thank you.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      God, why do you have to be so caring?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “One” Alice snapped her fingers, giving him the go ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello! I am Billy Maximoff. This is Rio Vidal and Agatha Harkness”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio waved while Agatha gave a pathetic smile at the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Today these two have agreed to be my
     <em>
      lovely
     </em>
     contestants to play a well known game of Hot Ones!” He said, picking up the stack of cards. “From these, one will ask the other the question on it. They can either answer or take a bite from the hottest sauces available”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     He placed the cards back down, pointing his finger in the air with a small,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh! And this game is filmed in front of a live studio audience”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jennifer and Alice leaned in front of the cameras from their chairs with an excited,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hi!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hello!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Team Rio!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Really?!” Agatha asked Jennifer for picking Rio’s side, but it wasn’t shocking either.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have me, Agatha. No worries” Alice nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks..” She muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Rio laughed, rubbing her hands together while looking up at Billy,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anything else or…can we get the burn on?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uhh, nope! That’s it” He nodded. “And it’s not burn on it’s-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “The heat is on, yeah. Stupid name you came up with” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's a song..” He muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha waved him off with a low,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, yeah. Just get on with it”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The boy muttered under his breath to edit that out as he rounded the table. Rio picked up a card while he slithered behind the camera. She cleared her throat, peaking her eyes over the edge of the paper with a low,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ready to lose?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop stalling and get on with it, idiot” She ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “So loving..” Rio hummed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She cleared her throat, strengthening it to be heard better in the video.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Here goes nothing..
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Question number one! If you could be anything other than human, what would you be?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh, these are the questions? Good. This'll go by quick.
     </em>
     Agatha thought to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She huffed out a laugh, shrugging her shoulders with a strong,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Easy. A witch”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And of course, their live studio audience wasn’t going to idly sit beside them without their own commentary.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? Witches are humans” Jennifer scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, gesturing her hand out before her as she looked over at the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “They literally fly and shoot magic, how is that human?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Doesn’t matter if they are or not,” Rio chuckled, shrugging her shoulders with the insult ready to fire. “You’re already a witch, so..doesn’t count”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snapped her head over, picking the hang nail off her thumb with her nose scrunched as she mocked a high pitch,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ha-Ha..” The woman leaned forward, swiping a card off the table as she muttered. “I still answered the question, so-
     <em>
      My turn”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She said the final two words with a grin. Rio rolled her eyes in reply, resting her elbows on the table with fingers interlocked in front of her lips. And briefly, Agatha caught a glimpse that sparked hope within her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn’t the calm, cool, collected and confident person she was trying to portray. Of course, she was competitive. Hell, they both were. But, she was nervous beneath the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As happy as it made Agatha to know she wasn’t the only one- She hated how part of her craved to soothe the younger woman, let her take a breath and know it’d all be okay.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     However, she couldn’t do that.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     All Agatha could do was let her eyes scan over the card and thankfully, like a beacon, the tiny print font suddenly glimmered in the dim kitchen light.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman slowly grinned, sitting up taller with a little laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, now this..” She rasped, flicking the card with a small wink. “This'll be fun..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Spit it out,” Rio demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Easy there,
     <em>
      tiger
     </em>
     ..” Agatha said, raising her eyebrows at Rio before taking in a breath, a small ‘
     <em>
      ahem’
     </em>
     was followed by the question. “What are the last five from your search history?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oooo”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The other three giggled in harmony, their tones vibrated off one another which created a tingle in the atmosphere. As if they were adding their own flavor of hot sauce to the table.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held her breath, avoiding Agatha's stare to try to keep her act as nonchalant as possible. Agatha pushed through her desire to bring her foot up, rub it against Rio’s shin as she had done so many times before. A tactic to soothe her worries.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      No! Torment her, embarrass her, win this stupid competition.
     </em>
     Agatha yelled at herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio ran a hand through her hair while picking up her phone, muttering under her breath,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No problem”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. curiosity and nerves firing within her. She perked up in her seat, tilting her head with a low,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure you don't want to take a bi-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nope. You’re not winning that easy, Harkness” Rio popped her lips, tapping the first search. “First off, T-rex dog costumes”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffed, shaking her head as she rushed out the words,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Don’t dress Nicholas in that” Agatha said. “He’ll be annoyed-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And how would you know?” Rio asked. “He isn’t
     <em>
      your
     </em>
     dog”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's words came to a stop. She froze, took a sharp inhale and forgot to let it go. Her fists clenched, jaw tightened, heart sank while feeling she was becoming sick.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Nicholas Scratch, aka Nicky, was as much Agatha’s dog as he was Rio’s. They found him on the side of the road together, raised him for nearly half a year before Agatha left.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t seem phased by her words. Their friends had no idea how deep it cut, the meaning behind it all. They just chuckled, shaking their heads at their friend’s competitiveness. All while Agatha could only stare, hold her breath and think to herself,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      How dare you…
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Second,” Rio continued. “Queen size bed sheets, dark green”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She continued down the list, unphased with each one.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “New Oreo flavors, Chinese food near me, and-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god, these are boring!” Jen groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Give us the juicy ones!” Alice added.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know what,” Jen shot up, walking over to snatch Rio’s phone out of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh, it’s really only supposed to be them,” Billy said. “I already have to cut your guys' commentary as it is..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman scrolled and Agatha took in the sight of Rio’s cheeks burning red. The younger woman had also moved to grab the bottle of hot sauce, drenching the wing as she chewed on the inside of her cheek. Curiosity sparked brighter than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Not only to figure out what Rio's recent searches were, but more so-
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Why are you panicking?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crossed her arms, watching closely and leaning close to hear what Jennifer would have to say.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, now this-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was only supposed to be the most recent five, Kale” Rio looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh well,” Jen shrugged. “Billy needs good content for his assignment, right?” She smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agreed!” Agatha chirped.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t look over. She instead dipped her head down, bringing the wing closer to her lips. Agatha chuckled as she rasped,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Losing already?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio muttered some Spanish words under her breath. Ones that were incoherent, but filled with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No..” She put down the wing, sitting up taller and bringing her eyes to glare into Agatha’s. “I’m not a loser”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well in that case...list ‘em off!” Agatha grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen cleared her throat, smirking wide as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “How to move on from an ex...”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And like clockwork- Rio’s face hid, body sulking as she pulled her lips back to bite on. She brought her fist up to rest against her mouth, trying to hide every piece of embarrassment flooding through her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bit on her lip, knee bouncing as her heart started to pound like an EDM bass line in a nightclub.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Songs for a heartache playlist-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, that’s gay as fuck” Alice snickered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shot their friend a strong glare, hiding her face not a millisecond after.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “More dog costumes..” Jen said.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Makes sense,” Billy shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh? And how to make your ex want you ba-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio aggressively lunged forward to pick up the chicken wing, taking a brutal bite before snatching her phone back.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      No. NO!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait, wait-!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat up, looking over at Billy with her hand extended out towards Rio. Her heart was thundering in her chest, panicking to switch gears back to where they were. Make it so Jen had to finish those words.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can she even do that?!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She needed to hear it, maybe even see the search history for herself to believe it. Did Rio want her back? Was she not the opposite of Agatha?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh my god-
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, that’s cheating! She can’t take her decision back. Jen-” Agatha snapped her fingers twice, pointing at Rio's phone. “Keep reading, I-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, uh- That’s kinda’ cool actually” Billy stammered, trying to ignore the subtle fear Agatha struck into him. “Besides, need some footage of you guys burning your taste buds off” He chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked, chewing down as she spoke through a mouthful of chicken,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ha-Ha”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cringed when she saw the few pieces fall out of her mouth, but it wasn’t worse than the disappointment residing in her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Curse this game, curse the rules. Agatha wished she would’ve stolen Rio’s phone and ran off, lock herself in her car to read every single one against the woman’s wishes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well? How’s the burn, Vidal?” Alice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed, taking a drink from her water to wash it down. She thought it over, let the taste sink into her mouth and tilted her head side to side.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not so bad” She shrugged, wiggling her hand in the air with her words. “Tingling, but not so much burning quite yet”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “For now..” Alice nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, Rio! Pick up a card” Billy said.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached out, smiling wide when the words on the card met her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, well..” Rio said, drumming her fingertips along the edge. “Tell us the last account you searched for on Instagra-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, come on! That’s not even a fucking question!” Agatha exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed as the others did as well, but not Billy. He was already looking somewhat terrified over Agatha’s fury.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shit, sorry! I…it’s like truth or dare, did I not- I thought you knew-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Answer the question or burn, Agatha” Rio sang, making the other woman want to rip her vocal chords out.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s not a question!” She yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Times a tickin’..” Jen said.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tick..tock” Rio clicked her tongue, head tilting side to side with both words.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grumbled, muttering under her breath how ridiculous and rigged the game was as she grabbed the bottle of hot sauce. It was like Rio fucking knew she was the last account. Even if Agatha blocked her on everything, she kept a spare account to stalk her with. She kept track of every new photo, story, all of it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Did Rio figure out the
     <em>
      “Agnes”
     </em>
     persona account belonged to her?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever. She didn’t want to know let alone reveal the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She poured a small amount on the wing, but Rio laughed and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no- Let me help”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned forward, tilting the bottle in her hand so it poured a heavier amount onto the wing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thereeeee we go. Gotta’ make sure it’s a healthy dosage, don’t we?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The older woman was frozen when their fingers touched. She held her breath, trying to avoid the others seeing how she was on the brink of being destroyed. It had been two achingly Iong months without Rio’s touch. The longest sixty three days she’d ever gone through.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Even when Evanora grounded her to stay in the house each summer or kept her hostage in her bedroom for weeks on end. None of it compared to existing without Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And as if she was never there, Rio pulled back to cross her arms against her chest. She wiggled her eyebrows, gesturing for Agatha to go on and take a bite.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I hate you..
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took the bite, dropping the wing back down as she scrunched her nose. She covered her mouth, eyes shut as the others laughed,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck you” Agatha cursed them through a mouthful of food.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is only level one!” Jen laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed a small,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mhm,” Before adding a swift, “Better be ready to answer
     <em>
      everything-”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not that bad,”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lied, reaching for her water to push down the rest. She chugged down a good portion of the bottle, trying to focus on the sensation slowly fading away. However, it was easier. This feeling was far more manageable than having to answer questions and apparently non-questions as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She shook her head, clearing her throat before rasping a low,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Next question”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushed the cards across the table, picking up the top one and handing it to her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s your turn,” She smirked, head tilted with a little, “Incase the burn made you forget that”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha muttered how insufferable she was before snatching the card from her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Give me that” She muttered, reading the words out without taking a moment to stop. “When did you stop believing in Santa- Oh, come on!” Agatha scoffed. “Billy these questions suck-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, do you miss the challenges instead?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glared at her for a passing moment before looking over to Billy, wiggling it in the air for an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I got them off Quizlet!” He defended. “Someone said they were straight from the game-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Straight from an elementary classroom, more like” Alice muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ignore her,” Rio said, grabbing a card to move them along. “We’ll just find another since there is a stack here” She reminded them, clicking her tongue right after. “Oh, okay- See? Here's a good one. Where do you see yourself in five years?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha huffed, completely forgetting it was her turn to ask a question. The burn was still on her tongue, trying to forget it was there with multiple sips of the ice cold water. Rio was still…
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     . The ultimate distraction for a good portion of Agatha's life.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's boring too..” Alice said.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Answer the question, Agatha..” Rio pushed, clearly wanting an answer to it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She narrowed her eyes, trying to figure out Rio’s intentions behind the question. Why did she think it was an interesting one and also, why did she seem so eager for Agatha to answer?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Far,
     <em>
      far,
     </em>
     away from here” Agatha slowly spoke, leaning forward to grab another card with a low, “My turn”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's shoulders dropped, the card crumbled as she tossed it aside. Agatha felt victory seeing her defeat. She was able to ignore wanting to figure out why Rio wanted an answer to that so bad and thought to herself,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      This is so easy.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha would be home free in an hour or so at the rate they were going.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The next question on the card was boring as well. Something about your most embarrassing moment from summer camp. They tried another one, and it was your favorite Halloween costume followed by a movie you hated most.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had enough of the stupid questions by the movie one. After all, this was a college assignment. Billy was growing into adulthood, his content should reflect that. Not some middle school sinking down to elementary level questions.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Sure, Agatha wanted to be able to walk away from this within the hour. Easy questions like so would grant her that. If they all weren't so picky, she'd be in comfy pajamas under multiple fleece blankets by now.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     That's what Agatha wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Easy questions are what Agatha needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Questions that weren’t heavy and held no meaning were perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     However, Agatha's wants and needs were never crystal clear. She'd always been a complicated mess. A walking cycle of chaotic emotions that never settled to just one.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With Rio across from her, the slight burn still on her taste buds (She blamed Rio for that. Agatha wasn't sure why, but..Rio was to blame for it), Agatha's devious brain had plotted against her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She flicked the edge of the paper, clicking her tongue before looking up with the sparkle of the devil in her eyes,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's your biggest regret in life?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Oh shit.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A heavy silence dropped between them all. Not a single soul in the room seemed to expect such a heavy question. Not even Agatha who asked it herself seemed unphased. If anything, she may have looked the most surprised, wondering herself where it came from.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio and Agatha were too busy staring each other down to notice how Billy leaned over to Jennifer. Confusion and nerves written all over him, frantically swiping through the questions on Quizlet as he mumbled,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That…that isn’t a question- She’s going off script”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Jen scoffed, looking over at him in disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re really shocked over this?” She asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy shrugged, looking back up at the duo before over at Jen and Alice who were now watching them with amusement in their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why is she making up her own questions?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Probably because you had questions about believing in Santa Claus..” Alice muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And she’s Agatha” Jen added with a shrug. “Plus..the last two months and how these two haven’t stepped foot in the same room..”
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have our suspicions” Alice finished.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy gave them both a questionable look, but the three were silenced as Agatha spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Answer or weep, Vidal” She pushed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing to weep over..” Rio shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “If that’s so, answer the question”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s lips parted as if she was going to answer, but ultimately cowarded out of it. Agatha silently felt disappointment sink into her bones. Even if she wanted Rio to lose, and felt the earlier easy questions were the best, she craved actual answers to her questions more.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand reached out, grabbing the second bottle of hot sauce with the words,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Pain is Good Louisiana Style”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clenched her jaw, sitting back as she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hope the pain is good..” She muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, it will be,”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled as if she expected Agatha to be upset with her for the decision to take a bite.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She counted back from three before taking a bite, instantly cringing before collecting herself to chew thoroughly. Her hand covered her mouth, pressing against her lips as she tried to ignore how it tasted.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are your eyes tearing up?” Jen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “They are!” Alice laughed with a clap of her hands. “Now we’re talking!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started to tap her foot, fingers drumming along the table top while swallowing down the remaining pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ready to give up?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Please.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Give up.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I can't trust myself with more questions..
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The younger woman puffed out a laugh, grabbing her water with a shake of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not a chance,” Rio said before slamming down a few gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha fought between pleasure and regret. She hated seeing Rio uncomfortable, but it was also the sweet taste of revenge for dodging her question. A beautiful cocktail Agatha could only hope would leave a mark on her ex-lover.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After a bit, Rio nodded softly, collecting herself before being able to continue on.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright..” Rio craned her neck, rolling her shoulders back. “On we go!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She picked up the card, smirking viciously at the printed words that had become meaningless. Billy would have to kiss goodbye to the scripted words. The cards were solely now just blank props in their hands.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “When was the last time you cried?” She asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Ding ding ding..
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Like a wrestling match bell from above, it rang and let both know the battle was on. The search history was the start, Instagram an instigator, regret a push, but tears? A question to figure out where Agatha was emotionally?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh. The war had begun and Agatha was ready to fight.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Everyone in the room expected Agatha to take a bite. She wasn’t vulnerable in the slightest. Jen once joked Agatha wouldn’t know how to cry even if a gun was pushed against her skull.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Then again, this was Agatha they were waiting on. A woman filled with tricks, sarcastic ways as if it was her blood that kept her heart beating.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She slowly grinned, making Rio’s smirk disappear like it was never there. It melted, faded, washed away as her lips parted to argue. But like a jet, an engine that roared, Agatha sped by her to rush the words,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “This morning when I realized I really did agree to do this stupid challenge” She grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared and stared, let the others chuckle and shake their heads over Agatha’s wit. Jen had muttered how she wasn’t surprised while Alice gave her kudos for being so quick.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     However, Rio wasn’t going to back down that easily.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hm..” She hummed, pursing her lips while putting the card back down.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha picked at her thumb, head tilted to the side, trying to figure out Rio’s game.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's the
     <em>
      hm
     </em>
     about?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, looking back up as she said words that would piss Agatha off.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I call bullshit”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed through a laugh, arms crossed against her chest as she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can't call my answers bullshit,” She said. “Doesn’t work like that, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Both of them shot their attention over to Billy who froze. He flickered his eyes between both, wondering which side he was safest on. Ultimately, he chose the woman who terrified him more than the other did.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha’s right…censorship and all that” Billy added.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gestured to him with a strong laugh that screamed,
     <em>
      Ah-Ha!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, what he said!”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Rio huffed. She rolled her eyes, throwing her head back as she raised her voice out,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whatever. We all know you’re lying!” She exclaimed, picking up the bottle of hot sauce and spilling it over one of Agatha’s wings. “Take a stupid bite for crying out loud. No cheating”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ha!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha yelled, shoving the woman's hand back. Neither noticed how a streak of hot sauce spilled across the table top. Thankfully, Billy was smart enough to not point that out.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s rich for someone who backed out of the search history question. Is that not cheating, Billy?!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of having Billy choose a side again, Jen put her hand in front of him to take over. She glared at Agatha, but then to Rio so both knew she wasn’t picking one over the other for the cheating scandal.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Listen!” She ordered. “The both of you are clearly,
     <em>
      unsurprisingly,
     </em>
     bending the rules here-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She started it..” Agatha muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, whispering under her breath,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Eres una perra tan inmadura”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shot her eyes back over, narrowing her eyes as she reminded Rio-
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am not an immature bitch, but you’re an idiot for forgetting I picked up some Spanish from you..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The younger woman shifted in her seat, avoiding Agatha’s glare.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Had she forgotten how much of the language Agatha picked up over the years?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Especially the words Rio would chant between bedsheets?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Or did she
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     Agatha to know what she thought?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Eres una gilipollas”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shot up with a laugh the second Agatha muttered the words, but the older woman could see straight through her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn’t only annoyed, offended and pissed off by Agatha calling her an asshole. She could see the lust in her eyes, the memories rushing through them both and
     <em>
      fuck-
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was thankful it wasn’t just her finding herself in these kinds of predicaments. The woman wondered which memory was running through Rio’s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Is it the first time you started teaching me Spanish?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Was it when I begged you to make me cum in that language? Caught you by surprise how I knew all those words?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What are you thinking about?
     </em>
     <em>
      <br/>
     </em>
     <em>
      Which moment?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Why can’t I read your mind?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay!” Jen exclaimed. “Unless this is suddenly Billy’s Spanish assignment or some shit- Keep it English for his sake”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s fine, I’ll just edit it out”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     He rushed, desperate to do anything to keep the peace. But Jennifer Kale was never one to let shit slide. Especially when it came to Agatha and Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You two are the most competitive assholes I know,” She said. “So, I’m not shocked you’re finding loopholes and trying to outdo the others, but seriously- This isn’t for you. It’s for Billy”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She pointed to the boy who weakly grinned.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “He just needs his assignment and we can all go home. Capiche?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Both muttered agreements and nodded in sync. Jen looked them both over before standing back, but spun around with a snap of her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And furthermore, I don’t know what has been up with you both the last two months, but..it’s good to see you in the same room..even if I’m close to killing you both”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha closed her eyes, exhaling a small sigh through her nose. Rio appeared the same way. Both disappointed, distraught, filled with regret for what happened and how their friends were left in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t fair, none of this was. Agatha hated how everything had ended. Even if she was the one to run away, get the hell out of dodge and try to erase her existence from Rio’s life- Her entire world felt destroyed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She had avoided every single hang out, party, or dinner in an attempt to not see Rio. The thought of being near her, having their eyes meet, hearing that voice she only listened to through videos- It made Agatha sick and terrified all at once.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And what pissed her off as time went on?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t care. She wasn't the same as Agatha. There were no signs of avoiding and shying away. Rio always took the risk of seeing her anytime their friends all got together.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The only way Agatha could view that was Rio moved on faster than the speed of light. She never even disappeared for a week. They were all out at a bar the following Saturday night after Agatha left.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chewed her bottom lip, the familiar jealousy and rage crawling up her skin like a spider multiplying by the dozens. She clenched her jaw, sat up straight, found another pit of fury to throw flames from.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Here's a hypothetical scenario question”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked over, eyebrows furrowed as confusion painted over her face. Her lips parted to ask what she meant, but Billy peaked around the camera to stammer out a few words that came out like broken pieces of a puzzle.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Um, Agatha..wha- Those aren't a thing for the gam-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let's say!” Agatha sang, drawing out the two words with a clap of her hands, completely ignoring the boy to her left. “You have yourself a pretty lover back at home-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, do I?” Rio asked, catching on to the attitude in Agatha’s tone. “Wonder what that's like..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused, raising her eyebrows.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what is that supposed to mean?” She asked. “This is hypothetical. You aren't supposed to actually feel like it-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Exactly. That’s why I'm wondering since it's a hypothetical situation” Rio shrugged. “You make it sound like I'm taking this
     <em>
      personally
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, it sure sounds like you are” Agatha puffed out a breath of air, shaking her head along with it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat up, reaching for the hot sauce off the table.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, then to cut for time I'll just man up and take a bite so you don't even have to finish this hypothetical question of yours. Sound good?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      No. Stop avoiding my ques-
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t have a chance to argue, convince, process anything. Rio took a bite the second the hot sauce covered the wing. She squeezed her eyes shut, jumping in her seat as she squealed a high pitch,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Woo!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice belted out a laugh, Jen chuckled while Billy giggled over the sight. All three oblivious to how Agatha’s nostrils flared, fingers balled into a fist so hard her nails threatened to pierce her palm’s skin.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She hated this, hated
     <em>
      Rio.
     </em>
     How the woman was dodging all her questions, willing to endure burning pain over answering anything Agatha asked. And furthermore, Agatha kept screaming to herself,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      STOP ASKING HER QUESTIONS!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Suddenly, Agatha didn’t care that she was in pain anymore. The woman could burn in the pits of eternal hell for all she cared at this rate.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smacked the table twice, jumping in her seat while shaking her head back and forth. Agatha smirked, arms crossed as she enjoyed the sight of her ex-lover in pain. It wouldn’t match up to the two months of heartbreak Agatha experienced (because clearly Rio didn’t care, right?), but it was something.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can forfeit the game if it’s burning too much,
     <em>
      honey
     </em>
     ” Agatha said through clenched, a smug smirk plastered on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head, reaching for her water to chug the cold liquid down. She gasped at the end, catching her breath before pointing directly at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not in this lifetime or the next- Anyway!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached for the next card, not bothering to read the original question. Jen may have scolded them for cheating, but Billy still wasn’t getting his original questions back.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you ever lied about being in love with someone and if so, who was it?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Are you fucking kidding me?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You ignore my questions and have the nerve to ask me this?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy’s eyes bulged, he turned to Jennifer to whisper in her ear with panic in every letter that made up each word.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no! This is definitely not one of the ques-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice, shut him up”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen ordered, not bothering to look his way. Her attention was focused on the duo pulled back in their own world. A cage they had locked themselves into like two wild animals ready to eat each other alive.
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Their friends always had suspicions the two became something more. Alice always suggested a friends with benefits type of deal, but Jen knew. She always did. The woman called it years prior the two had fallen in love, but they were idiots blinded by their own self doubts and denial.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And this? Jen was all ears, her eyes wider than ever before with one unanswered question running through her mind,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      What did you idiots do to each other?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “On it!” Alice said.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman shot up from her chair. She reached around, covering the boy's mouth as he muffled incoherent words. He struggled in her grip, but the way Alice hit up the gym nearly five times a week? Billy should know the fight was hopeless.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice cut through them, silencing Billy’s muffled pleas for them to go back on track.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha. It's a yes or no. Have you ever
     <em>
      lied
     </em>
     about being in love with someone or-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The older woman grabbed the bottle of hot sauce off the table. She swore a whimper crawled up Rio’s throat, but quickly brushed the thought away. Her hand trembled as she shook the bottle, coating the wing in the dark color.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that a no, Agatha?” Jennifer asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Agatha asked, but realized what she meant a second after. “Yes. No, yeah- I-” She shook her head, cursing out this entire game.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Why did I agree?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you still love them?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio quickly added, her voice a higher pitch than before. Agatha looked up to see how her eyes were watering over, lips quivering and
     <em>
      fuck-
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      No!
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You didn’t answer any of my questions, you’re not guilting me into this.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Agatha lowered the wing, eyes sharp with a glare that cut through Rio like a sword.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where in the game did it say you get to ask two questions in one? That should count for nine now, no?” She asked, quickly following up her words with more. “Technically ten if we go by that-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “New rules!” Jennifer clapped her hands. “Fifteen questions-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy broke free from Alice’s grip, breathless as he exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, that's not-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't care, Billy. This could be cut content and there's still wings leftover. So. Five more questions, ladies!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy caught his breath, chest rising and falling as he realized this was all hopeless. The women were clearly running the show and he was just the boy who would turn in the work they created.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     His shoulders slumped, arms crossed as he murmured a low,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Could be useful in editing, I guess..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Smart boy..” Alice muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     He rolled his eyes, moving to sit in the chair Jen had been in prior. Jen now stood behind the camera where he had been prior. She became the director, monitoring and making sure the answers would be out in the next hour or so.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And with Jennifer Kale in charge- No one was leaving this room, neither were leaving the table until the truth became exposed to them all.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Sorry, Billy
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine..” Agatha snarled, picking up a card while thinking of the next question. “New question..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She drummed her fingers along the table, ready to speak when Rio cut her off-
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You never took your bite”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up, the sauce covered wing still in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And Jen doesn’t want us to cheat anymore, so..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen hummed with a nod, confirming Rio's words.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, either answer my question or take a bi-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept her eyes locked with Rio’s as her teeth dug into the tough texture. She wasn’t a fan of wings, but learned to cope with them since Rio ordered them for dinner so often.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The burn didn’t waste a second to sprawl throughout her mouth. She dropped the wing, trying to throw curse words out but they were all muffled. Even as her eyes shut, nose scrunched, every muscle in her tightened while trying to refrain from making any sounds to show she hated it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It still felt sweeter than giving Rio the satisfaction of an answer. Especially when she was taking a swig of water, catching a glimpse of the flames in Rio’s eyes as she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Good. Now you know how your questions being dodged feels..
     </em>
     Agatha thought to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She caught her breath, wiped the tears from her eyes without thinking and-
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “God dammit!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her body jolted in her chair, hands smacked the table as she shook her head multiple times over. Alice broke out in laughter, Billy jumped up to soak a paper towel in cold water. Jen sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose while Rio’s smirk slowly began to grow.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You did not just touch your eye with hot sauce on your fingers” Jen deadpanned.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,
     <em>
      Jen!
     </em>
     My eye is just on fire for no good
     <em>
      fucking
     </em>
     reason at all!” She yelled out.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy ran over, bringing the wet paper towel up to rub over her eye. Agatha jumped, smacking his stomach for how he came up out of nowhere. He made a strong,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Oof!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And stepped back, but he wasn’t upset or offended.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, I just-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re fine, Billy”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s voice softened, feeling bad for her reaction. She didn't mean to smack him or scare him more than he already was. But when your eye is burning, your ex girlfriend smug as can be across from you..
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just-” She sighed. “Hand me the paper towel, I’ve got it”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     He did as such, leaving the woman to take care of her eye. It was about a minute or so before Agatha blinked rapidly, looking around to make sure her vision was better. Her left eye still slightly burned, a small blur as she scanned around the room.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     To her surprise, through Rio's smirk- Agatha still caught the glimpse of concern. And if she wasn’t so pissed off, maybe she’d take the time to acknowledge it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Maybe she still cares”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The four words whispered in the back of Agatha's mind weren’t coherent to her. Only rage, annoyance, frustration and resentment resided. All of it covered up anything else that didn't belong to that category.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wiped off one of the tears, listening to the murmuring surrounding her. If Rio wanted to drop heavy bombs, Agatha could do the same. Hell, in her mind, she had more power to work with over Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     With one question, she flipped a switch that silenced the entire room and brought a new wave of tension between them all.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you ever lied about your whereabouts to a lover?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy and Alice’s conversation came to an abrupt stop. Jen spun back around, eyes bulged as she scanned Agatha up and down, checking for signs of a potential explosion. As if a bomb was ticking on the table and it’d be on Jen to defuse it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Though out of them all, Rio looked the most shocked and dumbfounded. Her lips parted, jaw slacked open ajar, barely able to voice a low,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugged, crumbling up the paper and tossing it to the side. She folded her arms against her chest, kicked a leg over the other while reclining back,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Answer or take a bite. Pretty simple, don’t you think?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Ohmygod..”
     </em>
     Jen muttered under her breath with her palm pressed against her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice walked behind her, leaning up into her wife’s ear,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is..are we- Will they actually kill each other?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen slowly shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “For once..I don’t know” She said.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice gulped, nodding with a muttered,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Oh boy..”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha and Rio had only fought two previous times in front of the rest, but looking back on them? It didn’t feel like what they were seconds away from. The funny part was, none of them would believe those two fights were minor either.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     But now? They felt on the verge of a world war between two women. Jen was confident the building would catch on fire with the flames of fury, Alice was worried about a homicide charge in their near future, and Billy? Well..
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     That poor boy was so confused and would definitely regret not taking Jen and Alice up on their offer to play the game for him.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s voice was low, a warning for Agatha to step back and not challenge her. She leaned forward, snatching a card and snarled a growl,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know the fucking answer to that. Pretty simple one!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh!” Agatha laughed, not wasting a moment to fire back, “If it's so simple, why don't you fucking answer it then?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gripped the card in her hand, bending the edges with her nails threatening to poke holes through the paper. She flared her nostrils, sat up taller and didn’t bother caving into Agatha’s question.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes or no question,” Rio relayed. The volume of her voice rises higher with every word. “Have you ever collected all your belongings in the middle of the night and left a lover's apartment with no trace you ever existed?! Yes or no, Agatha!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha growled, shaking her head while snatching a card off the table.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Question. Have you ever not realized you were living with someone because they were never home to begin with or-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god!” Rio laughed, smacking the card down. “Next question! Do you like repeating the same arguments? Do you never take into consideration, I don't know, hearing the other person out?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Said person would have to be home for more than twenty minutes to speak to-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Said person would have to be home altogether instead of sleeping on our friends fucking couch”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes went bloodshot, fear coursed through her veins as oxygen ceased to exist. The woman lied relentlessly about how she had her own beautiful apartment with plans to live alone for eternity, never showing a sign of hope to return to where she truly belonged.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Did Lilia fucking rat me out? How-
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah! I fucking know where you are, Agatha. That new apartment shit is a
     <em>
      pathetic
     </em>
     lie”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is none of your concern where I am! Are you fucking stalking me now?! Is that it?!” Agatha yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio put her hands up with a laugh, rolling her head back as she cried out,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, my apologies! How terrible of me! How dare I care that you have a roof over your head!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Their friend’s eyes were switching left to right. When Agatha spoke, they watched closely. When Rio spoke, it was just the same. Jen held Alice back from stepping in, even if she was worried about one murdering the other.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy on the other hand? Well, this was his assignment. After all, he worried about his deadline, how he had to have this turned in by the end of the week. Plus, the boy always hated seeing anyone fight. Especially two people he cared deeply for.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the hell is going on?” Billy whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know, but I like it..” Jennifer smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “IT IS NOT YOUR RIGHT TO STALK ME!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “HOW IS IT STALKING?! I CAN’T EVEN DO THAT WHEN YOU RAN OFF AND BLOCKED ME ON EVERYTHING!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The two weren’t just yelling anymore, they were full on screaming. The veins in their necks sticking out, faces turning red as knuckles shaded white. Billy swore the walls were shaking, Jen was grinning like a mad woman as Alice nervously bit her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will they get my channel banned if we upload this?” His whisper was frantic.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen hummed with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “They haven't fucked on the table, so..” Jen pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not yet” Alice muttered, bringing out a tiny laugh from the other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy shook his head. He was about to add something else, but Rio's voice broke through the air.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “New question!” Rio exclaimed. “Have you ever thought about being wrong-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh! I never am wrong and we both know that,
     <em>
      honey
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “So you’ve never considered you read the situation
     <em>
      wrong
     </em>
     and responded in the
     <em>
      wrong
     </em>
     way-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you ever thought about how the other person felt? As if they were abandoned?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “HA!” Rio smacked the table, shaking all the bottles and sending on over the edge, crashing all over the floor. “Do you know how hypocritical you can fucking be to someone?!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you realize how ridiculous you sound?!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you use your brain for one moment and realize how much of an asshole you ar-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy shook his head, stepping to them with his hands up as he raised his voice over them both. He couldn’t take it anymore. Desperate for the assignment to be completed and also for the two to find middle ground again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, guys- I really need you both to stop using your own questions and try to focus back on the game and-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Their heads whipped over, voices raised in sync as they screamed out a strong,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “SHUT UP!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The boy jumped back, nearly bumping into the camera if it wasn't for Alice tugging his shirt to the right. His body trembled, breath staggered as the two women beside him rolled their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you know how to avoid a danger zone?” Jennifer harshly whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “But my vide-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck your video!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pointed at him, but kept her eyes directly on Rio. The woman pushed to her feet, smacking the table to emphasize her motion. She then leaned down, pointing inches away from Rio’s nose and screamed out a strong,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “AND FUCK YOU TOO!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snickered, seemingly unphased with the reaction. She crossed her arms, swiping her tongue on the inside of her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “So? You’re forfeiting?” She asked, rolling her eyes as she muttered a low, “Shocker, look who is running away all over agai-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wasn’t thinking as she grabbed the glass of water. Rio was in the midst of her grumble, eyes rolling in annoyance- Though her words cut off when she felt the ice cold liquid splashed against her face, soaking the collar of her shirt and splashing in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen gasped with a muffled giggle. Alice was squeezing Billy (Who was definitely scarred from the game of Hot Ones) shirt as she hid her own laughter. All three huddled together in their own trio, an audience seemingly forgotten by their friends.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stormed out of the kitchen. The bathroom door rattled the walls as it was slammed shut not a few seconds later, leaving the group stunned in their own silence over what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wiped her mouth off with the back of her hand, looking down to see her shirt with water stains and knew as well her makeup was smudged.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll uh…paper towel..” Billy said, rushing over to grab the roll.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen clapped her hands, smiling wide as she exclaimed,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well! I am very glad to have taken aspirin for today!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Honey, go after her please” Alice sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It went unspoken who took what side. Alice always stuck by Rio to talk to her, Jen would follow Agatha (She was better at not taking Agatha’s shit over Alice), and Billy stayed where he would be the safest.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, that wasn’t anywhere near Agatha who seemingly was ready to assault anyone in her path.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Already on it..” Jen muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman rolled her eyes as she took the same path Agatha had just stomped through. Behind her, Billy gave Rio a towel instead of a paper one. She thanked him softly, bringing it up to her face to drag along her skin. Alice crossed her arms, leaning against the table as she sighed out a low,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “So..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio avoided her eyes, focusing on trying to dry the fabric of her shirt off.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That the recent secret break up?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice knew Rio since high school. It was always clear when she went through a break up and the last two months were no secret. The woman just wouldn’t fess up to who it was, what happened, any of it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     However, with the show the two had just put on, the fight their friends had access to hearing-
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen’s theory became a reality.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked the water droplets off her lips before tugging them back to bite down on. A small nod followed, whispering softly,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh..yeah..yeah”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh..” Alice nodded. “Interesting..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it?” Rio laughed, a pathetic one that made Alice hear the void in her heart. “I have…no idea what happened”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just now, or in general?” Alice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Both” Rio tossed the towel down on the table, sitting back with her arms crossed. “She’s just..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head, holding her breath to suffocate the sobs and tears that threatened to burst at any given moment.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Work got hectic and I was running around on different trips and Hela, you know we work well together- She and I get along and we started hanging out more and yeah, okay, maybe I missed a few calls and didn’t say goodnight here and there, but-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She figured you were cheating?” Billy asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Both of them looked up, forgetting he was there completely. But, he wasn’t the small teenager they met years ago. He was becoming a man, close to graduating with a college degree. Rio figured it was fair to treat him like the adult he was.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She nodded, giving him a sad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck” Alice sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She never even- We got into so many arguments about it. But either work called or she’d leave and then one morning, she was gone. All her shit. Like overnight she just…evaporated into thin air. She blocked me on everything and Lilia called me few days after to tell me she was with her…so there was that, at least, but-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stopped to catch her breath, clearing her throat a second after.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Obviously you never che-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio exclaimed, shooting a glare up at Alice who had her hands held up in surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just making su-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve fucking loved her for years. Way before all this happened, Alice. Why the hell would I cheat on her?” Rio asked. “Better yet, why would she think of me as a cheater?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shrugged, but surprisingly- Billy seemed to know what words to say.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean, I’ve known Agatha since I was a kid” He started. “And..I spent- She taught me everything like, you know..I stayed at her place a lot more than at home. Practically lived there through high school”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     He weakly smiled, bringing out a smile from the other two as well.
     <br/>
     <br/>
    </p>
    <p>
     Stone cold, bitchy, bitter, grumpy, Agatha Harkness was one of the softest souls deep down. Only a few held the key to that piece of her. Billy ended up being one of those lucky souls.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She opened up a lot when I was struggling with..friends, all that” He said. “It sounds like this is more..well, on her” Billy shrugged. “Self doubt, things like that”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked back at the now cold wings. The table was still wet with hot sauce and water, the chair across from her empty and vacant. She tried to listen in down the hall, but the last thing they heard was Jen nearly breaking the door down to get in. How they weren’t yelling, Rio didn’t know. And truthfully, she wasn’t sure if that was for the better or worse.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “That sounds like Agatha..” Alice nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know it does..” Rio muttered. “Just fucking hate she ran off instead of us talking-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sounds like you were always working” Alice cut her off, voice stern with tough love. “You’ve always been a workaholic, Rio. Since you were fourteen and got that stupid working card-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey! I was buying us all coffees, was I not?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah! But you were missing out on everything because of work. And now look,” She gestured down the hall. “You literally had the girl you fell in love with, pined over for years..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Patterns sometimes are hard to break” Billy chimed in. “It sounds like it’s on both ends. You with work, Agatha with the running..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed while Alice laughed, looking up at him as she spoke,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “When the hell did you grow up on us,
     <em>
      teen?”
     </em>
     She used the old nickname that was retired on his twentieth birthday.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     His cheeks darkened a red, little smile as he shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “He’s right though..” Alice said, returning her attention to Rio. “Takes two to tango, two to break”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah..” She nodded. “But after all that? I mean,” Rio gestured to the water over her shirt and the mess around them. “She doesn’t- She’s pissed, there’s no way she wants to figure things out and-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, she went off script” Alice said.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Really
     </em>
     off script” Billy muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She was asking things that were meant for you and her..” Alice pointed out. “If she didn’t want to figure shit out, she would’ve stuck to Mr Juvenile’s f’ing Santa Claus questi-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ugh! I didn’t realize they were there” He groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice snickered and Rio hated the feeling of hope within her. Even if her lifelong best friend was always right, she was terrified of being heartbroken all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just..trust me, she-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s always loved you” Billy rushed. “It’s always been the most obvious thing about you two..”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     The woman tilted her head to him.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “He’s right,” Alice said. “Besides, she would’ve left instead of hiding in the bathroom if she was done with you-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, she’s staying for his assignment. We know tha-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, not really..” Billy said. “Not like one of you wouldn’t take her place, Agatha knows that. And we all know her. When she’s done with someone, she’s done. I mean, her ex Wanda is basically dead to her- No?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice snickered, remembering that saga well.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Trust us, kid” Alice said. “You know Jen too..she’s definitely talking sense into her”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Or being killed..” Billy muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Could be both,” Alice added.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed, running hands over her face as she muttered to herself,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck you, Harkness..

     <em>

    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re being ridicu-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Am I?” Agatha laughed. “She’s the one that ran off with that bitch. I tried-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “By running away yourself? That’s your definition of trying?” Jen laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Agatha lowered her head into her hands. She was sitting on the edge of the tub as Jen stood above her, arms tightly folded against her chest with a glare that made Agatha know she wasn’t going to escape this.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She was never home..” Agatha muttered before lifting her head, raising her voice just a bit higher. “How do you fix something with someone who chooses work over and over?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you fix anything when you pack all your shit and run off like you’re Cinderella who has to leave before midnight?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen never softened her approach with Agatha. She always walked in like a force to be reckoned with. A storm, monster, some creature Agatha was never able to scare off.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think you’re both idiots more than you have been for years now, actually. So. Congrats. Didn’t think you could hit a new low”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “The hell is that supposed to mean?” Agatha looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ve been in love with each other since we were in college” Jen pointed out. “It took you both till your thirties to fucking figure that out and then when you do finally get together- You run away and she does the same!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She had enough with the entire situation, that much was clear. Agatha couldn’t entirely blame her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     For years, Rio and Agatha would switch on and off. One would be dating while the other had fits of jealousy and avoided the rest. Back and forth they’d play that game, never once taking into consideration how their friends felt. The only times things were settled is when neither had a girlfriend or date to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And with that pattern going on for years, Agatha would never know why it took them so long to figure it out. Why being friends never felt like enough, why they couldn’t stand to see the other with anyone else. It was obvious, clear as day, and yet-
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They wasted so much time. Agatha thought that to herself with an added,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      And here we are…wasting more time.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I knew why you’ve been gone for two months, by the way. Ask Alice, I pinned it. Especially when Lilia said you’ve been at her pla-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did she just tell everyone where I was?!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, cry me a river. You have friends who give a shit about you” Jen rolled her eyes, not slowing down for a second. “You avoided us and disappeared for two months. It only made sense we needed to know you were alive and safe somewhere”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sulked back into herself. Her chin propped on her palms with elbows digging into her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     To Jen, she looked like a pouting child who just got caught stealing extras from the candy jar. The sight was amusing to say the least, but..she needed to get her back out there. Push her to Rio and fix whatever the hell was needed to repair them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why do you do this to yourself?” Jen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do wha-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ve destroyed everything good in your life” She bluntly put it, not slowing down to add, “When are you going to realize you deserve happiness?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha peaked up with a small smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you actually being nice to me right now?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen rolled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Unfortunately, being stuck with you since we were kids has made me pity you somewhat”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Agatha snorted through a small laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It was their own language to hate one another, but deep down Jennifer and Agatha only ever had each other. Their home life was shit, everyone in school turned their backs on them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As much as they appeared to be enemies, it was a total and complete opposite of that.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Evanora..” Jen said the name Agatha hated more than anything. “She’s dead and gone,” She added. “Stop letting her rule your life-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then why do you still believe you’re unlovable, huh? That you’re too evil for something good? That no one sees you as anything more than a nuisance?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Each word punched Agatha in the chest. She looked back to the floor, feeling her heart twist as Evanora’s voice echoed in her mind. Jen was right and Agatha fucking hated her for it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not saying letting go of that is easy. It’s not, you know I’m still…well,
     <em>
      me
     </em>
     because of my father” Jen shrugged. “But, letting myself be loved..sharing my life with someone who sees me as everything else than I was raised to believe..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen took a moment, letting the silence linger before she continued,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’re getting old, Harkness..” She smirked. “Time to put your big girl pants on and let yourself be loved”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cringed for her choice of words, rolling her eyes as she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Big girl pants is..jeez-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you either do that or sit in the nursing home alone,” Jen said. “It’s all up to you, I’m just..I will tell you too-” She paused, leaning down to get closer to her face. “That girl out there? You have her wrapped around your finger. You have always said to jump and she asks how high..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman gasped, feeling a hitch in her throat that kicked into her mouth. She held her breath, memories flooding through like a tsunami how Rio went above and beyond for her. No one in history treated Agatha Harkness like Rio Vidal did. Not even Agatha took care of herself the way Rio had.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t give that up..” She said. “And for thinking she’d cheat on you? After everything? That’s idiotic and even you know it, Agatha”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen leaned back up and took a breath. She was about to continue on, but a soft few knocks against the bathroom door silenced her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?” Jen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s me,” Billy said. “Can I come in?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman looked over at Agatha who was already nodding, collecting herself so Billy didn’t see the wreck she was in. That was impossible to hide, but Agatha didn’t need to know that.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get in here,” Agatha ordered, voice raspy but still strong as if she wasn’t just sounding weak.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     He pushed the door open, giving a weary smile to them both as he softly clicked it shut behind him. His back rested against the door, thumbs fiddling with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio- Uh, she’s ready to continue whenever you ar-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She didn’t leave?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No” He said as if it was obvious. “So..are you going to-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I may just go home, kid” Agatha sighed. “Alice can take over or-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen rolled her eyes, turning around to hide how badly she wanted to punch Agatha in the face for her stupidity. However, Billy grew up in more ways than one. And maybe being the special spot in Agatha’s heart gave him the confidence to challenge her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, Agatha..” Billy begged. “My assignment is due this weekend! You said you’d do this and I really gotta’ get this uploaded and-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice is perfectly capable of doing that. Hell, her and Rio would be a better duo”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” He said. “You and Rio-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Billy-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want you two to do this!” He exclaimed. “You said you would and you’re backing out and that’s bullshit”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen whipped around, Agatha’s head snapped up with their eyes bulged the exact same way. He stood taller himself, chest puffed while he held his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have taught me to not chicken out and that’s what you’re doing. You’re being a chicken-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Billy, you have no idea what you’re asking me to do. This situation, it’s not something you’d understand. You’re too young”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     He scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, yeah” He nodded. “Asking you to eat some wings with hot sauce and answering questions is so difficult. You’re the one who went off script! I had the questions literally printed for you!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “He’s got a point..” Jen muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shot a glare over at her before looking back at the boy who was desperate, pleading for her to get back out there and make good on her promise. She hated the little spot in her heart that ached, grew mushy and weak- A feeling that made the avoidable,
     <em>
      un-
     </em>
     avoidable.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     This time she’d stick to the printed questions on each card. She’d let Rio win, they’d part ways and Agatha would plan to never return this time around.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     It’d be simple…right?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fine” Agatha put her hands up, pushing up to leave the room. “Roll on, continue, On with the show- Whatever the hell you wanna’ f'ing say”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy nodded, his smile radiating as he opened the door with a kick in his step.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grunted, pushing by him while Jen winked at him. She mouthed a quick,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Nice work”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Which only made Billy smile brighter.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They followed behind, watching Agatha rip the chair from the table and drop in it. From behind, they could see Rio’s body tense up and Alice shot a wide look over to Jen who nodded in reply. The unspoken words,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Game on”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her head, craning her neck as she adjusted the black top over her waist. The fabric's wrinkles were all soothed and straightened back out. She caught a glimpse of Rio's soaked shirt, holding back memories as much as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Surprised you stayed..” Agatha said, not giving any attention to Rio as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Surprised you didn’t leave..” Rio whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The other woman weakly spoke. All confidence and wit in her tone was gone. Agatha wasn't sure what scared her most. How she felt relieved, but also disappointed Rio was empty. She knew the woman well and no fight was on their horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Makes two of us..” She muttered, clearing her throat as she looked back over to Billy. “Well? Are we good to get this thing going or..?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Billy looked over the camera before giving a thumbs up.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, reaching forward to grab a card. However, Rio had jumped the gun, not allowing Agatha to take the lead as she planned.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Question..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no humor, venom, none of the above in her tone. Agatha knew Rio better than she knew herself. Without a doubt, Agatha knew she wasn’t going to stick to the script like Agatha planned to do. The only hope she could hold onto was Rio appeared lifeless. No energy to fight like they just did a few minutes prior.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha still picked up the hot sauce bottle to be prepared. She didn’t have it in her to fight, answer tough questions that they’d fire back and forth. If burning her mouth was the only option, she’d do it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you ever wished something with someone went different?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was bringing the wing to her mouth when she froze, registering the words.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Take the bite.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Do not give in to her.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Few bites and you’re home free.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you mean?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You really can’t keep your mouth shut, can you?
     </em>
     She thought to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shifted uncomfortably in her seat, spinning the ring on her finger. The silver one dressed in tiny skulls. Agatha had bought it for her many moons ago and Rio hadn’t taken it off since.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “A situation or…
     <em>
      relationship
     </em>
     of the sorts”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shit question. We all wish that with someone” Agatha muttered. “Choose a different one or I will-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just answer it, Agatha..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her breath, hearing the exhaustion in her ex-lovers voice. How her eyes were vacant, null of any life behind them. Rio looked as if she became Death herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You fucking killed her..
     </em>
     Agatha blamed herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     She shook her head, stubborn to not let this become anything else than just a game to rush her way through.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I already did. We all-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “So there's no specific situation?” Rio pushed. “Like a fight that could’ve taken a different turn? Do you-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're arguing an answer I'm already saying yes to-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “But not specifically, you're just tossing out an answer that's for everyone. This is a question for you. So do you or do you not wish something would have chang-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You relentless shithead.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god, fine! Yes” Agatha groaned, gesturing the wing in the air as she exclaimed. “I answered! Do I have to take a bite of this shit or what because it smells gross”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy shook his head, silently confirming Agatha was cleared. She dropped it back down on the table, wiping her fingers off on the towel instead of rubbing her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     At least she was successful with that, Agatha told herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned forward, picking up a card while muttering the word,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Question..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes scanned the words, pulling back her lips as she read it to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “What is your favorite song at the moment?”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Simple. A very easy question and they all seemed to be as such. Agatha was home free, she could follow each one and hopefully Rio would do the same.
     <br/>
     <br/>
     But when her eyes flickered up, seeing the empty and broken soul across from her. She heard and felt Rio’s pain. Agatha knew the last question was an attempt at a conversation. She hated how fucking clear it was Rio was trying to thred the first needle to the stitches and pull them back together again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Time to put your big girl pants on and let yourself be loved”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As much as Jen’s choice of words made Agatha cringe, she hated how right the frustrating woman was. She slowly looked over to catch a glimpse of Jennifer with her eyes glaring a loud,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Don’t fuck it up”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart instantly ran and trampled over her mind. It drove off at a high rate of speed with no brakes, right off the edge and into Agatha’s pit of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Fuck my life..
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you…So to speak, wanted to change something that happened with..” She tilted her head, shaking a hand in the air. “
     <em>
      Nooneinparticular
     </em>
     - What would you change?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She watched as Rio’s eyes slowly lifted up. The brown orbs shined, pupils blown as her lips parted just a touch. If they were on better terms, Agatha would be laughing while pulling Rio into her arms. She always adored when she caught her off guard, surprising her with something. The look on her face was always precious.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m here!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The front door swung open, the other five jumped as the woman nearly broke furniture rushing through. Her jewelry clashed together, boots threatening to kick in the floor. Rio only laughed over Alice's small,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Ow!”

    </p>
    <p>
     As Lilia's purse crashed against the back of her head in passing. The older woman didn't even seem to notice that happened though.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have I missed the show, dear?” She asked Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where the hell have you been?” She asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll- Ugh, go into details about that later”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia's eyes went straight for the duo at the table. Both had returned their eyes to one another, locked in their own orbit and stared as if the others weren't there.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well..” Lilia muttered, taking the seat Alice offered her. “Front row, new glasses, ready to witness these two lovebirds-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     That word had snapped their trance as Agatha shot her head over, Rio held back a laugh, wondering why she seemed frightened to be figured out. Not like they hadn't put on a damn show already. Their friends clearly were smart enough to put two and two together.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lovebirds?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lovebirds for competition” Lilia crossed a leg over the other with a shrug. “Well? On with the show, ladies!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right..” Agatha muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is so much footage to cut out” Billy groaned. “Can we just go to the next question? Then I could just cut this entire part and-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Rio shook her head. “I had an answer for that. I did, I-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cut the kid some slack,” Agatha shrugged. “There's other ques-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, but it was desperate. No humor behind any piece of it. Agatha slowly realized panic was setting into Rio's being. How her chest was rising and dropping at a more rapid pace. The way her eyes scanned around helplessly to each of them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I- He's gotta’ learn anyway! It's a school assignment and-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, it isn't that big of a deal..” Billy said. “I'm still learning, I promise”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The younger woman brought a hand to her chest, pushing as if she could break through her own skin and bones to hold her heart from exploding.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen and Alice were sharing looks to try and figure out what the next move was. Lilia clearly appeared to be five miles behind the rest, wondering what she had just stepped into. And Billy (In the most innocent, adoring, way) thought Rio truly was upset with him.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     He shook his head, raising his voice as he spoke,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay! Okay, she's right- I'll do all the work. I promise, Rio. I-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “She doesn't give a shit about that,” Lilia told him.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you mea-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ask it again,” Rio demanded, cutting Billy's words off.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was picking up another card when Rio ordered the re-do. She pulled her lips back, fiddling with the index carde, debating if she should repeat her question or not. Of course, Agatha wanted the answer. Rio clearly was ready to give one to her that wouldn’t be laced and drenched with sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe the answer would be something that’d turn her relief into regret.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Would she have chased me?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Would she have never started this to begin with?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Does she regret the kiss?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     They’d barely been at this game for an hour and Agatha was gaining a migraine from it all. She felt like her neck was stiff from whiplash at every turn of events.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     One moment her and Rio were close to clawing each other’s hearts out, she was tossing water while screaming words that strained her vocal cords. And the next, they were in a vulnerable spot they barely dipped their toe in before.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes pleading for Agatha to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s fears bubbling up, threatening to silence her whole.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha straightened in her chair, shoulders rolled back as she chewed on the inside of her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Question..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She managed to whisper, watching as Rio’s head popped back up. The younger woman mirrored Agatha as they had for years. Two souls in separate bodies, two minds of their own, yet always in sync with the other. Well, that’s how it should be.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you ever cheat on someone?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The question punched Rio in the stomach just as it tore the final strings of Agatha’s heart to shreds. She wasn’t sure where the question originated from. Silently, the woman told herself it was okay to repeat the original question to hear what Rio desperately had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     However, her heart took over everything else. She asked the hardest question Agatha barely uttered the words to months ago. It was easier to accuse, beat around the bush, never directly ask if her nightmare was a reality or not.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t hesitate to shake her head while their eyes were glued and locked with one another.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Question..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't say anything. How could she?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you really believe I’d do that?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t lie. She didn’t want to believe Rio would ever be that person. Deep down, she knew who Rio was. The younger woman was stubborn in her loyalty, dedicated to whoever she cared for and would never betray anyone’s trust. Especially Agatha’s.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, she moved to pick up the hot sauce to put on the wing. The bottle barely lifted into Agatha’s hand, but bounced as both of Rio’s palms smacked down on the table. Her chair screeched across the floor, rising to her feet with muttered apologies to Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ri-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I’m done!” She said as her voice trembled. “I’m not-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned back in the chair, head down as she tried to hold back the tears from hearing the pain in Rio’s voice. She caused it. She was the evil monster that should’ve never been born.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had taken a few steps out of the kitchen before spinning on her heel, storming back over as she muttered,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know, Agatha..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned down, her breath hot against Agatha’s skull. No one else in the room existed to Agatha right then. Only Rio, the fear she was striking into her (Rightfully, so), and her own self hatred for the mess she created.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “After
     <em>
      everything..
     </em>
     from doing whatever and being whoever it took for you to feel safe…”
    </p>
    <p>
     <br/>
     Rio clenched the jacket in her grip, nails digging into the leather as the texture began to rip. Her voice broke, a hitch in her breath as a few tears slipped out.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do I have to do to make you be-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know what..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s voice cut Rio off. She clapped her hands, standing up to turn the camera off.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh come on, it's such a good show” Alice groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, well…the look on Lilia's face says she can fill in the missing scenes” Jen said, waving her finger to the other three for them to follow. “Come on, outside” She ordered as if they were dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned around to watch as they left, waiting till Jen met her eyes to mouth a small,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Thank you..”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen nodded, glancing over to Agatha who still wouldn’t look up at either of them. She then returned her attention to Rio, an unspoken nod that screamed,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Good luck”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The front door clicked shut and Rio didn't spend another second in silence. Not when Agatha felt like a ticking time bomb ready to self-destruct at any given moment.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know what you want from me, Aga-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, running a hand through her hair. She was about to say something, but Rio smacked the table again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t get to fucking laugh. Two months of silence, Agatha!” Rio raised her voice. “You disappeared, you weren't around, wouldn't answer any of my calls and you blocked my social media and-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, yeah. Point taken, I-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was standing up, ready to flee the scene. However, Rio was steps ahead of her. She was the brick wall that Agatha wouldn’t be able to break through or climb over. Their height difference wasn’t dramatic, but Agatha felt small as Rio appeared to tower over her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Being a scaredy cat again, aren't you? Running away because things got a little hard?” She started to put on a childish tone at the end. “Do you need a blankie and warm bottle to keep you secu-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shoved her back, belting out a strong.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck you!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio dropped her belongings, not hesitating to shove her right back. Though her side of it resulted in Agatha dropping to her chair, barely able to register it as Rio above screamed out,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, fuck you!” She pointed. “If you just fucking stayed and didn’t run off and-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You were never even home, come on!” Agatha scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The younger woman went to speak, but Agatha continued on.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s always work with you” She laughed. “Way before there was an
     <em>
      us,
     </em>
     there’s work. You live and breathe the fucking thing. No one else matters and it sh-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then I’ll quit my job!” Rio yelled. “Will that make you believe I love you, huh?! Would it?!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s smile faded. Her eyes went wide as she stared in disbelief. She watched as Rio picked up her bag, rummaging through frantically to find where her phone disappeared to. It wasn’t until the device was out, being brought to her ear did Agatha jump to her feet, ripping it from her grip.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, give it back! I’m quitting, I’ll fuckin-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are not quitting your job. Are you insane?!”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Tears spilled from Rio’s eyes while the back of her hand pressed against her lips. Agatha felt her own wall break, eyes stinging with threatening tears of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please” She whispered, voice cracking with pain that killed Agatha. “Just- I’ll do anything, you have to believe I would neve-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “All I’ve wanted is you for years! I’m sorry I made you feel otherwise. I-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just come home and I’ll never leave again! I’ll find a job to work from home or
     <em>
      fuck,
     </em>
     I don’t know! I promise to figur-”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha muttered under her breath before grabbing the rambling woman by the back of her neck. With one pull, she crashed their lips together in a rough manner. Their teeth clashed, noses bumped so hard there’d be a subtle bruise by morning.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Their foreheads pressed together, heavy pants that slowly settled in sync with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I believe you, okay?” Agatha whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was trembling as her hands lifted to grip the texture of Agatha’s shirt. She didn’t say anything, giving the space for Agatha to continue on.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just..” She whispered. “I figured you’d get sick of me eventually, you know? And Hela..she’s- You two have so much in common and you hung out with her a lot and yeah- fine, I was..
     <em>
      jealous,
     </em>
     I guess and-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jealous is an understatement..” Rio mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused for a moment before puffing out a small bit of air in amusement. She knew Rio was right. The attitude in her words was warranted as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need you to hear me..” Agatha whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need you to trust me..” Rio replied.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She held her breath, letting the words digest and knock sense into her. It was a
     <em>
      huge
     </em>
     request, one that’d take time to work on and build overtime.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Can I really do that?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Is trust something that could happen for me?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The questions swarmed in her mind like a group of flies, buzzing and tormenting her mind. However, as Rio tugged on her shirt, eyes poured into her own with a silent plea. A hushed promise she’d choose Agatha over everyone and everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Hell, she was about to quit her job on the spot for Christ’s sake. If Agatha didn’t snatch the phone from her hands, she’d be without a paycheck five minutes ago.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had to hold up her own end besides learning how to fully trust her. No more letting the instinct to run win. She’d have to glue her feet to the floor, maybe install locks Rio only had a key to so escape wasn’t an option. She didn’t want the choice to leave, but Rio would always give her it. The woman may fight to keep her, but she’d never give Agatha no choice. That wasn’t in her nature or who she was.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if a few minutes ago, it appeared as if she was seconds away from tying Agatha to the chair (Not in the way Agatha would like either). Ultimately, she’d give her freedom and maybe that was a reason to trust her as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “If you want to…be in control…you can be”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had said those words their first night in bed together. When Agatha felt on the verge of jolting away as if Rio was electricity that shocked her. Hook ups were easy, but having sex with someone she truly cared about? Who she spent years nearly every day with?
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     God, Agatha remembered what those words did to her. Not only how Rio gave herself up to Agatha, but…she felt safe. She knew Rio wouldn’t judge if she had to step back or take complete control of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Question..” She whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed, lips pulled back in fear.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you uh..” Agatha licked her lips, looking around as she spoke barely above a breath, “Missed me or whatever?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She watched as Rio gawked at her, but it faded away into a silly grin. One that made Agatha’s heart flutter, watching as Rio’s cheeks lifted. Her lips curled up, tongue swiping the inside of her cheek (And
     <em>
      fuck,
     </em>
     how Agatha missed seeing that signature move of her’s up close).
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Through the sweet moment, the cheeky thing Rio had always been came to light. With one hand, she let go of Agatha’s shirt to reach over, grabbing one of the wings off the table. Agatha’s eyes watched the move, her smile faded when a sharp gasp inflated her lungs.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Just as Rio went to take a bite, Agatha smacked it out of her hand. It hit the table and Rio’s laughter hit all the right places in Agatha’s ears. She shook her head, holding Rio close as she mumbled,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re cruel”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled, pushing her body against Agatha’s more as she whispered,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You love it”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Yeah, you idiot. I do.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She cleared her throat, not verbally saying those words out loud. Another reason she knew trusting Rio was worth it. The woman didn’t always have to talk because Rio just
     <em>
      understood.
     </em>
     She saw through her, memorized every nook and cranny in every hidden spot.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha finally felt seen for the first time in her life and it took till now to realize it.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Maybe I’m the idiot..
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And for the record,” Agatha pointed, pressing her finger against Rio’s sternum. “That boy is
     <em>
      ours
     </em>
     and you will not give him a fuckin’ dinosaur wardrobe” She ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s little grin turned into her lips pulling back into a firm line. She looked around the room, tilting from her heels to her toes. A soft tune hummed in the air, a tell tale sign she was avoiding being caught doing something that’d drive Agatha crazy. Like getting another plant that’d pile onto the next one, ordering take out when Agatha made dinner (The older woman couldn’t cook and even she knew it, but that's besides the point!), all of the above.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio..” Agatha lowered her voice. “How many outfits?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, to be fair!” Rio started, that stupid grin returning as if it never left. “My ex left me about two months ago and her side of the closet was pretty empty so-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know what? I don't want to know” Agatha surrendered. “But when I wake up next to your corpse with him standing above, don't say I didn't warn you”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh? Wake up next to me?” Rio smirked, eyebrows raised with her words. “You haven't even asked if I wanted to get back together and you're planning to live together again?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned, muttering under her breath how much she hated her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just..” Agatha shook her head. “Shut up and kiss me”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     If Rio ever put up a fight or argument to that particular demand, Agatha would know she’d been cloned or swapped for a different Rio. Even during their two month fight, Agatha knew Rio would cave and kiss her. Ever since that night under the mistletoe, it became not only Rio’s addiction, but Agatha’s as well.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Sure, the sex was unlike anything else. Agatha never understood the hype and love for sex until she tasted Rio on her tongue, felt the woman’s hands touch every inch of her, everything about their intimacy made sense. It just felt right- No,
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     felt right.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Somehow as their lips were pressed together, tongues reuniting as if they were minds of their own- terrified their owners would keep them apart. Rio had pushed Agatha by her waist, having her drop back in the chair as her legs straddled either side of her. She moved her hands to hold either side of her face, Agatha gripped Rio’s hips with force as if she needed to keep her still (Rio had no plans on standing back up regardless of her grasp).
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Barely a few minutes went by before Rio needed more, her kiss wasn’t enough. Two months of pure agony, touching herself at night to the memory of her lover’s touch- She felt the withdrawals begging for relief before she became dope sick.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Question” Rio gasped against her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed, not offering a verbal inquiry to what she was looking to find an answer over.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “How long uh..think we have before they-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Between Jennifer’s questions, Alice's jokes, and Billy's confusion..”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cut her off. If Rio wasn’t so desperate, she’d laugh how Agatha was clearly questioning the same thing herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And assuming you haven't let a single soul touch you in the last two months…”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced up, eyes daring for Rio to challenge her while on the same token dreading if another woman’s hands touched her lover’s body. Though as Rio leaned into her more, head tilted back exhaling a strong,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, no..only you”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman groaned, telling herself on repeat how she could not take Rio on the table right then and there. But
     <em>
      fuck,
     </em>
     she was starving and the only meal that could keep her alive was right in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then I dare say,” Agatha husked, dipping her head to kiss the damp fabric over her breasts, up her neck, along her jawline until their lips brushed against one another’s again. “We have time”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The second those three words were whispered, Agatha’s hands slipped the fabric of her shirt up. She didn’t hesitate to pepper kisses along every exposed piece of her chest, avoiding where Rio was craving most.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know I wore this top because I knew you'd be here, right?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t hold back the moan that crawled up her throat. She shouldn’t even be surprised the woman pulled such a move. Agatha would’ve worn the white button up blouse with just the black lace bra (Rio bought her that one not even a week into their relationship. Agatha fondly remembered laughing over it, but..it still became her and Rio’s favorite one) to drive Rio crazy herself.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know the shirt is wet, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She lifted her head back with a smug smirk, proud of her work that only made RIo’s nipples harder from the ice cold liquid. Rio didn’t offer a laugh or a snarky reply. Instead, she tangled her fingers through the back of Agatha’s hair, tugging the roots before pushing the woman’s face back to her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s laughter puffed warm air against her skin, but that sensation was quickly taken over by something far more pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Shit!”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hissed as Agatha wrapped her lips around the sensitive bud on her left. Her tongue swirled, teeth nibbled down before pulling back with an exaggerated,
     <em>
      pop.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, you’re despe-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shut up,” Agatha murmured. “Trying to make you cum just from this agai-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “One time!” Rio laughed. “It was once-”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I'm going for twice. Lucky number two, baby” Agatha winked up at her before diving back in.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Both of Rio’s fingers threaded through Agatha’s hair. The wild, crazed, messy strands she missed holding on to dear life with. Her other hand held onto her shoulder, hips thrusting forward with every swirl of Agatha’s tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      ‘Lucky number two, baby’
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Oh, Rio knew she didn’t even need luck. Not only did she have Agatha’s touch again, but she had
     <em>
      her.
     </em>
     Rio could go home without the empty feeling in her heart. The spot in her bed wouldn’t be vacant, her life wouldn’t feel hollow.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She had agreed to the game simply to piss Agatha off, have an excuse to see her again, and of course to help Billy with his assignment. And over all of that? Hot Ones had brought her the-
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god” Rio said, eyes lighting up as she pushed Agatha back.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman chuckled, rasping a low,
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Too sensitive, honey?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no” Rio shook her head. “Just realized- The game of Hot Ones brought me back my
     <em>
      Hot One”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed, but smirked against her own will. The joke was stupid and yet, the grin on Rio’s face outweighed the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re lucky you’re this hot, idiot” Agatha rolled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled, but it was cut short as Agatha’s lips returned in a more aggressive manner. One that was determined to silence any future jokes (Of course, that would always be impossible) and make Rio cum in her lap with just a few sucks and kisses. She thrusted her hips forward, Agatha’s hands moved into action to maneuver them.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha always controlled Rio’s pace, determining how quick or (Painfully) slow she would be allowed to move. Thankfully for Rio, Agatha was utterly desperate as she accused. The woman pulled back and forth with fire ripping through her touch. Rio tried to hold back her moans, turning them into whimpers as the sensations combined into one.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      “Mi amor..”
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whispered, only making Agatha’s tongue swirl faster and if Rio wasn’t so overwhelmed, she’d be giggling over the power a simple language had over the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Both knew they’d jump ship the second the others trickled back in or maybe when Rio fell apart in her lap. Agatha already thought about throwing the woman over her shoulder, bringing her to the car and kidnapping her from the rest. However, lust and starvation kept her locked where she was. Neither complained over that though.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And as for Billy's assignment? Alice and Jen would take one for the team. Maybe even Lilia if Jen threw a fit about wings being gross enough.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And if Jen didn’t end up playing the game? Well..maybe she could find a YouTube tutorial on how to stop a camera from recording. Also, a therapist for Billy who’d inevitably figure out the camera was never turned off while editing that night.
