      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Professor Vidal has always hated Professor Harkness. Agatha's teaching style was wild, chaotic, a party for each class. Rio on the other hand felt a classroom was a sacred space to learn. Not to have dance parties or comedy shows in. The two were opposites, enemies in each other's eyes.</p><p>However, one night- Rio finds herself crying in the ice cream aisle after being stood up by her date. To make matters worse? Agatha Harkness finds her there.</p><p>Little did Rio know, the best years of her life stood in that aisle with her...</p><p>_______________________________</p><p>A small few chapter AU fic:)</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Okay so..what started out as a long, mega, one shot has exploded into something far more LMAO. I genuinely have fallen in love with this and I hope you do too. I'm thinking it'll be four chapters, that may change! I have it all written out just editing/working through lol</p><p>Also! This one is also pretty different to what I've done in the past. Added some texts, even a tiny playlist for the fic if you're interested. It's songs I listened to while writing/obsessing over this. Lol. I really, really, REALLY appreciate if you're here to read it. Poured my heart and soul into this one. Enjoy:)) xo</p></blockquote>

“Are you fucking kidding me?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, tossing her phone down on the desk with a loud smack, not caring if the screen shattered or cracked. Frustration flooded through her veins, annoyance picking at every inch of her skin. </p><p> </p><p>“She can’t just up and change everything!” </p><p> </p><p>She exclaimed, her voice strained with desperation for this to all be a nightmare. One she could wake up and shake off as if it never happened. </p><p> </p><p>Jen shrugged, leaning against the edge of her desk with arms crossed. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s Harkness. Lilia lets her get away with murder”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“At this rate, she’ll be giving lectures on how to do that” She grumbled. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha Harkness.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Agatha. Motherfucking. Aggravating. Irritating. Harkness. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, thinking over the name that made her bones shiver, jaw clench till every muscle in her was so tense- they were all close to exploding louder than any sound in the universe. The reaction to anything Agatha related always remained the same. Violent, life threatening, way too much for Rio to handle.</p><p> </p><p>(And she always ignored when anger and resentment shifted into lust and wonder. Rio tried to <em> never </em>acknowledge any piece of that)</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had started teaching at the university a few years ago. Three achingly long years ago, to be exact. Not that Rio was counting. The newest professor was a quick hit. The talk of the campus barely into her first semester. After her first course, one class, just two hours and suddenly, every student wanted a piece of Professor Harkness. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Rhetoric: The Art of Persuasive Writing and Public Speaking” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Which should have been the only name, but after a month- Harkness and her students had given the title it’s own nickname, </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “That’s It! Now We’re Talking!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio silently scoffed, outwardly cringed. The name sounded straight out of some 80’s game show and after briefly meeting Agatha Harkness? That only made more sense as to why the name was chosen. </p><p> </p><p>The professor wasn’t like the rest. She wasn’t Jennifer Kale who was a woman full of sophistication. Who appeared to be above all, put together, and completely self centered. That last part, Rio had to learn to put up with. But, she was better than the Kaplan kid who didn’t know his left and rights. How he earned his role as a TA, she’d never know. But, that was Alice Wu-Gulliver’s issue to put up with. </p><p> </p><p>To make matters worse? Lilia Caldreu (The president of the university, or how she liked to be called as “<em> The Order of All Things”) </em>was known to commonly take pity on the weak. Rio assumed that’s how a mess like Agatha Harkness was able to nudge her way in.​​ The only good thing the new addition had been good for was making Rio appreciate her time off more than ever. </p><p> </p><p>She’d always buried her head in work, never taking a breath or a second away from her classroom. (The others joked that the university was Rio’s home, second home, and vacation home all in one). </p><p> </p><p>But then, Agatha came along and suddenly, Rio felt a <em> deep </em> need. No- A strong desire to be a million miles away from the campus every chance given.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t that Agatha was a bad person or a villain of the sorts, but she was in Rio’s eyes…weIl, immature. She didn’t seemingly take on the role as an educator as seriously as Rio did (in her mind, that was). Not to mention, Agatha couldn’t complete a sentence without a joke or insult. It drove Rio mad sitting in board meetings having to hear that grating, irritating, raspy, sexy voice (Okay, Rio was NOT supposed to think that, but she’d be lying to herself if she denied it).</p><p> </p><p>For Rio, it had always been a dream since she was a little girl to become a botanist. The professor aspect came later on in life when her friend, Wanda Maximoff, mentioned how she’d rule a classroom with ease. Rio thought too how beautiful it’d be to inspire others, maybe lead them in the same career path she walked. Plus her love for plants, that was always a perk. </p><p> </p><p>To see someone as careless, reckless, spontaneous, unorganized as Agatha becoming the university’s favorite? Well, maybe Rio held a bit of jealousy. A slice of bitter resentment. </p><p> </p><p>And what didn’t help? Another reason the woman was everyone’s favorite? Something Rio found difficulty arguing or not understanding. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Did you see Professor Harkness today? She looks way too good in purple..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I swear, I need to get in that class” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Oh shut up, you don’t even care about that subject. You just wanna stare at her” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “She’s hot!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Can’t blame you there..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Have you asked about her hair routine? I’m so jealous! I need it” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>On and on, Rio would overhear students muttering amongst themselves. Not that she’d dare utter a word out loud, but..Rio agreed. How could she not? Agatha Harkness was a stunning human being from head to toe. She was tall, confident, strided with ease as if she ruled the universe. Her laugh was contagious, a smile that radiated through the halls. She had crystal blue eyes that Rio swore glimmered in the dull fluorescent lights. </p><p> </p><p>There’d be times during board meetings or in the break room, Rio found it difficult to not stare at the other professor. She’d try to hide her gaze, harden and disguise it as a glare. Agatha had only seemed to catch her once or twice (Rio never caught on to how it was much more than just a few times). Always a wiggle of her fingers, a wink followed along. Sometimes a dramatic mouthing of the words,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Call me?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Which Rio always sneered at. She’d pack up her stuff, storm out of wherever they were to catch her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hated her. </p><p>Rio couldn’t <em> stand </em>her. </p><p>Rio wished Agatha Harkness never appeared in her life. </p><p> </p><p>No matter how hard she tried though? There was a tiny candle size flame burning within her. It never dulled, blew out into a cloud of smoke. The flame of intrigue and lust stayed bright, threatening to destroy her completely. </p><p> </p><p>She decided and told herself the feeling only developed out of spite. Maybe Rio held so much disgust for Agatha it turned into something else to prevent her from losing control. </p><p> </p><p>After all, Rio hadn’t been on a date let alone a hook up in years. Her head was buried in work, too distracted to have time for such things. So it only made sense seeing a woman such as Agatha striding through the halls, smirking everytime she caught Rio’s gaze, always irritating flirtatious comments that brought out something more than hatred within her- </p><p> </p><p>All of it made her feel something more than anger. It made sense it was nothing more than just being single for however many years. Hence why Rio was going on a date off an app her friend, Wanda, helped her create. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Tinder.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>God, Rio felt pathetic for it. Luckily though the woman she was going to see was interesting and a treat for sore eyes. <em> Eye candy, </em>Wanda had wiggled her eyebrows while saying the name. Rio had rolled her eyes over that.</p><p> </p><p>The date would help even if it led to a one night stand. Rio would be too in her head filled with disgust for herself over a hookup. Those always ruined her mentally, but…it’d distract her from Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>But for now? Just as always, Agatha skidded and danced her way around the rules. Which drove Rio to the verge of screaming every single time. Especially now unlike any other time before. </p><p> </p><p>“How the fuck did she manage to up and move her classroom overnight?” Rio asked with a shake of her head. “Did she fucking <em> bribe </em>Lilia into this?! That old woman has always been against creating chaos mid semester” </p><p> </p><p>“She’s Agatha,” Jen shrugged.</p><p> </p><p><em> She’s Agatha. </em>Fuck. That was always the explanation for how she managed to get away with things. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need to be three classrooms away from her,” Rio laughed, but it wasn’t humorous. No. It was complete disbelief filled with annoyance. “She’s loud enough and my classes need complete focus. Hearing her parties right down the hall won’t help”</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Jen agreed. “Go talk to Lilia about it. Maybe she’ll-”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio firmly said. “I’m not giving up my room. This has been my domain for years. Far longer than she’s even been here. Plus, all the natural lighting is perfect for the plants” </p><p> </p><p>She stood up from her chair, gesturing her hand in the air around to every plant scattered in her room. Jen watched as the woman began to pace, muttering incoherent Spanish under her tongue. A sign her blood was boiling with fury.</p><p> </p><p>“No..” Rio shook her finger in the air, tossing her head side to side. </p><p> </p><p>“Noooo, what?” Jen asked. </p><p> </p><p>“She isn’t going to win” </p><p> </p><p>Jen chuckled. </p><p> </p><p>“Win what, exactly?”</p><p> </p><p>“She doesn’t get to push me out, nope! Not a chance in hell, Jennifer!” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, using my full name. Awesome” She rolled her eyes. “You better not take this out on me. I didn’-”</p><p> </p><p>“She. Will. Not. Win!” </p><p> </p><p>The other woman muttered a low,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Oh my god”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Jen pushed herself off the desk, hands held up in surrender as she started to make her way to the door. </p><p> </p><p>“I need to go get ready for my next class. Good luck with…whatever this is- No, you know what?” Jen turned. “Focus on that date tonight, Rio. That’s more important don’t you think?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped her pacing, sending a wide glare her way as she muttered, </p><p> </p><p>“I regret telling you about that..”</p><p> </p><p>Jen laughed and tossed a wave over her shoulder, leaving her to her lonesome. However, that didn’t last more than two seconds. As if Rio’s temper couldn’t get any worse? </p><p> </p><p>“Howdy there!” </p><p> </p><p>The greeting chirped down the hall, Jen’s little laugh followed with some low chatter. <em> No. </em> That voice, it’s owner, <em> fuck! </em> Agatha was far too close to her room for her liking, gossiping with Jen most likely about god knows who. Maybe her, not that Rio cared (She did). </p><p> </p><p>“Go away..” Rio muttered under her breath as if Agatha would be able to hear her from afar. </p><p> </p><p>Her feet stormed over to the door, ready to slam it shut with dramatic force. She wanted to make a statement how Agatha was not welcome to be near her room more than she would be. The idea of seeing her in the hallway even more than before, hearing her voice clear as day. Not to mention that beautiful laugh that always was laced with the cutest snort- </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> STOP! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabbed the edge of the door, ready to push it shut when the figure slithered before her. </p><p> </p><p>“Hey there neighbor” </p><p> </p><p><em> Fuck. </em>She was too late. </p><p> </p><p>The older woman took in a deep breath, looking up to meet those sparkling blue eyes that shimmered with glee. It’s like she fed off being an annoyance, Rio swore it. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you want, Harkness?” Rio asked, voice monotone as if she was dead inside. </p><p> </p><p>“Just being courteous, giving my warm greetings to my new neighbors” </p><p> </p><p>She shrugged, holding out a tiny gift bag. It was a dark forest green, tied together with black ribbons and a purple bow on the side. Rio stared, trying to figure out what it was before she could open it. </p><p> </p><p>Did she even want to open it? No. She should shove it in Agatha’s face, add the reaction with a door slam and ignore her presence all together.  </p><p> </p><p>Instead, her curiosity betrayed her when Agatha shook the bag in the air with a higher pitch,</p><p> </p><p>“Made special for youuuu-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swiped it from her, not offering a warm grin or kind eyes. Her glare remained sharp. A frown stern stubborn to remain still. </p><p> </p><p>“Is that all?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged again, both arms crossed against her chest as she leaned against the doorframe. </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing in return?”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know we were exchanging gifts. Let alone up and changing <em> rooms” </em>She snarled. “You know that’s ridiculous, right? You’re up and changing everything. Your students now have to change their routine and-”</p><p> </p><p>“I needed a bigger room <em> for </em> my students,” Agatha explained. “Just as you need this,” She gestured into Rio’s spacious room. “For all your plants. Figured out of all of us, you’d understand”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, a tang of jealousy over how popular Agatha’s classes had become. Or…was it just jealousy that even more people had access to admire her all day? She voted the first (It was the second). </p><p> </p><p>“Great,” Rio said. “Again, is that it or would you like to continue being more annoying?”</p><p> </p><p>“What would you prefer, <em> Professor Vidal?”  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her professional name every now and then. And when she did? She always laced it with the same silky tone, rich in a deep rasp while her head dipped lower. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I hate you.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I think you know the answer” Rio nearly whispered, feeling the oxygen being stripped from her lungs. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha dramatically sighed, leaning back as she took a step away. </p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Agatha said. “Enjoy your weekend and the <em> gift” </em></p><p> </p><p>The woman slowly let that smug grin grow on her lips, wiggling her fingers in the air as she took a few steps back. In a small voice, one that sounded like it belonged to a ghost- She sang,</p><p> </p><p>“Ta-ta” </p><p> </p><p>She then had the nerve to wink before spinning around, letting her heels click down the hall. Rio’s grip on the door tightened, knuckles turning a pale white as she tried to rip her eyes away from those hips. The ones that swayed rhythmically  back and forth. A movement that plunged Rio into a state of hypnosis.</p><p> </p><p>“Professor Harkness!” </p><p> </p><p>The voice made Rio jump, eyes snapping over to Billy Kaplan running down the hall to meet her. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t run. You’ll fall and smack your head again, kid” Agatha advised. </p><p> </p><p>He slowed down instantly just as anyone else would because as always, Agatha had a way with getting people to do whatever she said. Hell, Rio found herself falling under the same spell the others did at times. Whether it was handing her the copies out of the printer while she passed or even offering to hold the door open for her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was a witch and everyone knew it. Or, at least Rio knew.</p><p> </p><p>As the two down the hall started to talk amongst themselves- Even from afar, Rio felt herself pulled into Agatha’s orbit. She was always such a strong presence even when her attention wasn’t on you. People always surrounded her, eager to hear what she said to say and hopeful she’d look their way. </p><p> </p><p>And once again? Her fucking beauty didn’t help.</p><p> </p><p>Rio admired the white button up blouse with her sleeves rolled up. Purple slacks that captured her waist perfectly, but flowed loose at the same time. She stood tall with her heels that added a few extra inches. The wild hair that never seemed to know what a brush looked like drenched down to her mid back. Rio’s eyes trailed down, admiring each inch until-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Shit. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked over as Billy searched through his bag. His lips were still moving at a fast pace, but Agatha didn’t seem to hear as she winked Rio’s way once again. Rio snapped out of her trance the second the wink registered in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, slamming the door shut and pressed her back against it with a strong inhale. Her eyes closed, trying to steady herself from the rush that coursed through her. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I hate her.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I hate her. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I hate her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio chanted the mantra, reminding herself of the truth (lie) to bring herself back down to earth. All was well after a few moments until she started to walk and felt the gift bag hit against her thigh. The reminder of Agatha’s gift was a punch, an annoying one more like. </p><p> </p><p>She paused, averting her eyes to the bag staring back at her almost as Agatha did so. Taunting, threatening, ready to drown her in regret at any given moment. </p><p> </p><p>Part of her wanted to just toss it in the trash and forget it existed. She had papers to grade, things to do. Agatha’s <em> gift </em>was below rock bottom on her list. </p><p> </p><p>Well…it should be. </p><p> </p><p>Rio placed it on her desk, staring and taking double glances its way. </p><p> </p><p>“No..” She muttered to herself.</p><p> </p><p>The woman shook her head, storming away to rummage through her bag for a piece of gum. A way she had quit smoking a few months ago was by living off it. Especially in tense moments like so. Relief took over when the cinnamon flavor sprawled across her tongue, the rubber, chewy, texture softened between her teeth. </p><p> </p><p>However, when she turned back around to her desk- The small gift bag stripped any relief she had felt. Erasing its existence completely. Rio shook her head, muttering under her breath how ridiculous it was before storming back over. She didn’t waste another second. The sooner this bag was gone, sooner Agatha was out of her mind. </p><p> </p><p>Rio began to work quickly, pulling out the small amount of black tissue paper. What she wasn’t expecting was a needle point to nip her skin, bringing out a strong hiss followed by a muttered,</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck?!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s antics were now becoming violent. <em> Awesome. </em> Though, Rio briefly thought how that’d be a lovely way to get her fired. </p><p> </p><p>Though, to her surprise (and secret delight) the assailant was a simple tiny cactus, healthy as can be. </p><p> </p><p>“Well…hello there” Rio greeted with a soft smile as she did to any plant that was new to her. “Aren’t you a cute little thing?” </p><p> </p><p>She admired each inch of the small plant, smiling at its beauty. After a few seconds, her eyes drifted to the note attached against the plastic pot it was packed into. Her fingers unfolded it, eyes scanning the few words messy in Agatha’s scribbled writing,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “This plant is a prick. Suits you xo” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Pop.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The bubble of Rio’s adoration and grin was tossed away. A bubble exploded into pieces of what it once was. </p><p> </p><p>She scoffed, crumbling the note and tossing it in the garbage with a low,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Fucking Harkness” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The plant was cute, but really? Such a stupid insult. A joke that wasn't funny in the slightest. <em> Whatever. </em>Rio moved to take care of the plant, making it a home amongst the others. </p><p> </p><p>What Rio didn’t consider as she made the plant comfy in her room? Every single time her eyes caught a glimpse of the cactus, it’d spark Agatha in her mind more than she already dealt with. </p><p> </p><p>And maybe, just maybe, that was Agatha’s plan all along…</p><hr /><p>The freezers buzzed in Rio’s ear. Matched with the faint, crackling, radio above her. The speakers were clearly old and torn. Most definitely had seen better days. </p><p> </p><p>Suffering through them, A soft throwback station that played classics from the eighties. Cyndi Lauper, Michael Jackson, The Police, all the songs Rio knew like she knew her plants. Word for word, detail to detail. It was her favorite part of the grocery store as stupid as it sounded. </p><p> </p><p>But, it was different this time. She was fresh off a Tinder date that never happened. After sitting at a restaurant table on her own for over an hour as the staff gave her cringe worthy sympathetic looks- She just wanted to run and hide till the end of time. </p><p> </p><p>Typically, Rio would sing to each song under her breath. She loved doing so, drifting into her own little world even if she was in public. However, she couldn’t. Not after what just happened, where she was, and why she stood in the ice cream section of the store- Drenched in tears, heart aching as her mind dragged a big weight of despair. </p><p> </p><p>Nine PM. They were supposed to meet at nine for drinks and a late dinner. A Tinder date that Rio already thought was fucking stupid, but she’d be lying if she said there wasn’t some anticipation for it. The woman was nice, laidback. Their text conversations flowed with ease. Rio really thought meeting her, having a date, maybe it’d spark into something. A relationship of sorts that’d make her feel whole. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had been sitting in the corner booth, nursing a beer ever so slowly. Each time the door opened, her body perked up and she pulled out a warm smile. Though it was wasted when the glimpse of said person was not her Tinder date. Every ten minutes that passed turned into an hour, then another, and finally Rio had enough of embarrassing herself. </p><p> </p><p>She left cash on the table, far too much for a single beer and some pretzels. But, Rio didn’t care. The staff had been giving her way too many sympathetic stares and pathetic smiles to stay a second longer. She had texted the date letting her know she left, but by the time Rio pulled into the grocery store’s parking lot?</p><p> </p><p>The woman must’ve unmatched them right after Rio messaged. </p><p> </p><p>That’s when the sobs hit her, punching her in the chest with a strong kick to her stomach. Not because of heartbreak, no. She didn’t even know the woman. It was disappointment, embarrassment, wondering endlessly why she wasn’t enough. </p><p> </p><p>Everyone she knew had a significant other for the most part. It had been that way her entire life. She was nearing her forties and barely had three girlfriends. Wanda always tried to remind her it wasn’t a bad thing, but Rio hated it. </p><p> </p><p>When was it her turn to fall in love?</p><p>When would the universe send a woman her way to spend life with? </p><p> </p><p>Everyday, Rio felt she was running out of time. So much of her was preparing to grow old alone, digging her own grave in the most morbid way.</p><p>
  <em> “Every step you take, I’ll be watching you…”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio cleared her throat, lowering her head when she heard the soft voice a few steps behind her. The woman strolling down the aisle had snapped her out of the blank staring trance she had stuck in. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Oh, can’t you see? You belong to me…” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>If Rio was in a better mood, she’d look over and offer to add on another lyric with the woman. Maybe they’d laugh together, the moment would be sweet before both went their separate ways. However, that thought didn’t help. That should be her with another woman. Someone to fall in love with, dance in the grocery store close to midnight, make laugh and cherish time with. </p><p> </p><p>That’s all Rio wanted. Was it too much to ask for?</p><p> </p><p>She brought her sleeve up to wipe the tears off her cheeks. A few sniffles were audible, louder than Rio preferred. But, it didn’t matter. Not like this woman would ever see her again. So what if she caught Rio crying in the middle of the grocery store?</p><p> </p><p>“This is my favorite one for the tears” </p><p> </p><p>Rio paused. Her heart stopped, jumping a beat before pounding harder like never before. She swallowed the giant knot in her throat, slowly turning her head over to see-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No. This can’t be real. This can not be possibly fucking real. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The universe hated her. Rio was certain because the universe wouldn’t give her a woman to fall in love with, no. But sure. It’d give her Agatha Harkness, the woman she couldn’t stand to be around. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, a puff of air pushed from her lungs as she took a step away to gather distance between them. Agatha was nearly shoulder to shoulder with her, gesturing to the freezer door with the pints of ice cream inside. Rio didn’t even know which flavor she was referring to, but she sure as shit wasn’t going to stick around to figure it out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed, muttering under her breath a few things in Spanish. From how ridiculous she was to cursing out the universe. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m just trying to be helpful, dear,” The woman sang (Or, was that Rio’s imagination because her voice was that damn nice?). “What’s got the tears rolling?” She questioned. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Isn’t dealing with her at work horrible enough? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Oh! Better yet, <em> who </em>has the tears roll-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio warned. </p><p> </p><p>“Was it my gift? Oh, you poor thin-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. <em> Fuck. </em> She wasn’t in the mood for this. </p><p> </p><p>“I said-”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, yeah. I’m not deaf, you know?” Agatha laughed and that damn, cute, adorable, stupid fucking snort broke in between. “We aren’t at work, <em> Professor </em>. You don’t need to treat me as your rival-”</p><p> </p><p>“You aren’t my rival,” Rio scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> You’re just my worst nightmare. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“A rival would mean there’s competition between us. There isn’t”</p><p> </p><p>“Awe! So we <em> are </em> secret best friends?!” Agatha taunted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, arms tightly crossed against her chest as she stormed off. She made sure their shoulders bumped into one another, making Agatha stumble back a bit as the woman let out a soft laugh followed by a call, </p><p> </p><p>“You forgot your ice cream!”</p><p> </p><p>“Go to hell, Harkness!” Rio snapped back without a second thought. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> What the fuck, what the fuck?! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her mind chanted the three words over and over. She was close to dropping the basket of snacks, running out of the store and maybe even put in her resignation from the university. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t sure what was worse anymore. Was it being stood up? Or how the universe never letting her meet a woman to fall in love with? And now, the most annoying co-worker who taunted and teased the hell out of her found her sobbing in the ice cream section on a Friday night. </p><p> </p><p>The third. That had to be the worst thing the universe had ever gifted her. </p><p> </p><p>The woman slipped back into the chip aisle, catching her breath right next to the Doritos. She kept a hand over her stomach, telling herself it was just the emotions and she was not going to toss up the beer and pretzels from before. That’d only sign her death certificate if she were to vomit all over the tile floor for Agatha to inevitably see. </p><p> </p><p>About two minutes had gone by when Rio finally felt her lungs find a steady pace. She wiped her eyes again, feeling the craving for ice cream strengthen more than before. The frozen dessert was always her go to as emotional support. </p><p> </p><p><em> She’s gone. No doubt about it. </em>Rio told herself. </p><p> </p><p>And the same thing she said earlier to Jennifer about her classroom?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She does not get to win.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio held her head up high, stomping back to the ice cream section- Agatha Harkness be damned. She wasn’t going to derail her from comfort food. She already saw her covered in tears, drenched in sorrow and despair. Wasn’t that the worst of it all already?</p><p> </p><p>Besides, who would stand in the ice cream section for two extra minutes? Well, Rio would. Especially when she was standing there sobbing for who knows how long. But, Agatha wasn’t Rio. She was fine, upbeat, clearly ready to be her teasing nuisance self and-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You’ve gotta’ be kidding me… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>When Rio turned the corner, she found Agatha standing in the middle of the aisle. Her pint of ice cream in her hand, looking down at the floor like she was checking if her feet were trapped in cement blocks. Rio noticed how it was the exact same spot she left her in. Unmoved, untouched. A statue or a robot who ran out of battery power. </p><p> </p><p>The other brunette hadn’t looked up at her. Rio still had a window to escape and try desperately to forget this encounter ever happened.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No. She isn’t going to win. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio cleared her throat, taking fast steps to the freezer as she rasped out a quick,</p><p> </p><p>“Is letting unpurchased ice cream melt a hobby of yours?” </p><p> </p><p>For a split moment, Agatha was in the shoes of the shocked one. How her head snapped up, eyes wide, lips parted as if she couldn’t find words to say. Rio should’ve known that wouldn’t last long. Speechless wasn’t in Agatha’s vocabulary, she was sure of it. </p><p> </p><p>Shock slithered into a tease. Agatha’s small frown blossomed into a grin. She tossed the pint of ice cream up, making it do a flip and catching it with ease. </p><p> </p><p>“Come over to my place and find out” She winked. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Why is she like this? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The thing about Agatha being a flirt wasn’t anything special. Rio knew she flirted with just about everyone. Insults, jokes, witty comments, and flirts. They were the language Agatha had created for herself. Her signature style, personality, all of the above. </p><p> </p><p>Sometimes though with how often Agatha flirted with Rio, it was hard for her to remember she wasn’t special. Not that she would be (She wanted to) at all. </p><p> </p><p>“In your dreams” Rio scoffed.</p><p> </p><p>“No, not that you perv,” Agatha rolled her eyes, but abruptly planted a smirk on her face with a low, “Unless-”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> Agatha” </em></p><p> </p><p>The woman snorted, tossing her hands up in defense.  </p><p> </p><p>“Listen, it’s very clear you need a shoulder to lean on tonight. I mean, come on, Vidal! It’s a Friday night and you’re crying in the goddamn ice cream section!”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re here too, you know?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not the one covered in tears and grabbing fucking <em> rocky road </em> out of all flavors” She scrunched her nose in disgust. “Jesus, no wonder you’re crying. I would be too eating that shit” </p><p> </p><p>Rio turned from the freezer, her eyes narrowed with lips tugged back out of frustration. Seeing the other professor stride through the university halls, the breakroom to every board meeting, having to hear her name from every single student. And now dealing with her in the middle of the fucking <em> grocery store </em>? Just when Rio didn’t think this night could get any worse…</p><p> </p><p>“Can you go one minute of your life without insulting someone, <em> Agatha </em>?” Rio glared.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you go five minutes without looking at me as if I’m scum of the earth, <em> Professor Vidal </em>?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grinned through the name, confirming Rio’s theory on how she couldn’t live without being a nuisance. And yet? Rio still couldn’t ignore what her professional name rolling off Agatha’s tongue did to her. Things that made the warmth between her legs burn, head spiral off its handles. <em> Fuck. </em>She hated her. </p><p> </p><p>“One for five? Shit deal” Rio scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“Three for three then?” Agatha countered. “And fine, since you take me as someone who sleeps on the first date- We don’t have to go to my place. My car has a good stereo if you just want to blast music till your eardrums bleed”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned, ice cream freezing her skin while watching the way Agatha wiggled her melted one in the air with a disgustingly, far too, overwhelmingly, intriguing grin. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Why are you debating this, Rio? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you so adamant we spend time together?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had to question that more than anything else, including why she was considering accepting Agatha’s offer. After three years of Rio clearly making it known she didn’t care for Agatha, wanted nothing to do with her, couldn’t stand her, all of the above-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Why is she asking me this? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Why are you so adamant we don’t?” Agatha countered. </p><p> </p><p>The younger woman didn’t give Rio time to think about her question. Instead she shrugged, voice sinking into a lower depth as if she wanted her words to be sacred for Rio’s ears only. </p><p> </p><p>“The doors won’t be locked,” Agatha said, taking a step forward. A tiny shrug, pout of her lips that curled into a little smirk. “Well, unless you want to get frisky then-”</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ!" Rio laughed in disbelief, spinning around on her heel to leave. Just as she was about to exit the aisle?</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, come on!” Agatha exclaimed through a laugh. “I don’t bite! Unless you want me to, of course, but..” She added. “Seriously..”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice had fallen, no teasing or humor in it. Rio felt her feet slow down, coming to a stop as she heard Agatha’s sigh.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we just put aside whatever it is that makes you hate me tonight?”</p><p> </p><p>The question made her ache. A tight squeeze in her chest, bringing a pain as if her heart was bruised. She pulled her lips back, holding tighter to the basket’s handles in one hand and pint of ice cream in the other. </p><p> </p><p>Why did Agatha sound exhausted? Especially as she spoke the word, <em> hate. </em>It sounded as if she was pinning all of this on Rio. Sure, maybe she never truly gave Agatha a chance like Lilia begged her to. But, it was the younger woman’s fault for being so damn annoying all the time! </p><p> </p><p>Between the insults, banter, annoyance- <em> No. </em>Agatha had her hand in this feud, divide, enemy stance as well.</p><p> </p><p>Rio spun around, eyes narrowed in on her target as she shook her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Don’t make it sound like it’s just me here” She ordered. “You have given me shit. You have insulted me, made my life difficult as all hell. It is not just me here, Agatha”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head to the left just an inch, lips parted before she whipped back a quick,</p><p> </p><p>“Three years, <em> Rio.. </em>” She said, putting emphasis on the first name she rarely spoke. Always nicknames or her last, but never the first. “You’ve glared, avoided, given me a cold shoul-”</p><p> </p><p>“You gifted me a cactus this morning that called me a prick!”</p><p> </p><p>“That is a light hearted joke compared to the shit you give me and you know it!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back, holding her breath as she tried to navigate the situation. No humor was to be found. Not a hint of a joke anywhere she looked. Agatha was serious. Her eyes exhausted, voice low, no teasing or flirts on the horizon. The woman looked…hurt, almost. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, desperate to rid the shitty feeling of guilt boiling up within her. Swirling in her stomach, drowning her heart and flooding her throat with more sobs. Not only was she not meant for love, she was a terrible human for making someone feel like shit. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Two for two tonight, good job. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, running a hand through her hair before waving it back in the air. </p><p> </p><p>“Listen,” She said. “You’re sobbing in the ice cream aisle on a Friday night. I’m here begging my enemy to hang out in my fucking car with me. So..”</p><p> </p><p>She shrugged, gesturing her hand aggressively between them both. Shaking it as if she was trying to free her words from their restraints. Agatha wouldn’t look at her anymore, Rio took note of it. Either her eyes were closed or they stared elsewhere. And suddenly, she missed those twinkling blue orbs for whatever reason. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> What is happening to me? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio knew lust, infatuation. Both were always there between the layers of resentment and fury. But this? She silently thanked Agatha for breaking the silence again before sinking herself into another pit of turmoil.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s just be pathetic enemies..together. One night only”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> One night only.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>A dangerous game, Rio knew it. But...it was Agatha. Surely, Monday morning everything would be back the way it was. This would be a distant memory, a fever dream more than anything.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine..” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s answer not only caught her by surprise, but the way Agatha’s head snapped up with her eyes bloodshot open? She was the deer in headlights between them both. </p><p> </p><p>She cleared her throat, holding her finger up as each word that escaped her made a statement of their own. Every syllable was loud and clear. </p><p> </p><p>“But this is not a date” </p><p> </p><p>“There will be no friskiness”</p><p> </p><p>“And Monday morning when you see me in the hallway- I don’t want to hear a word”</p><p> </p><p>“Got it?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything for a second. She stared and stared some more. Maybe they were close to forty seconds or a minute when the woman finally moved. Agatha’s infamous wicked smile slowly grew wide. Like a snake that crawled along her skin, stretching her cheeks ear to ear with hands up by her sides. </p><p> </p><p>She nodded, each step a smooth stride that brought her closer and closer to the older woman who may or may not have been regretting the decision already. But, it was too late now. Rio signed the deal, secured her ticket in Agatha’s passenger seat. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Sitting in Agatha’s car. With Agatha. Hanging out with Agatha…Oh, what have you done, idiot? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulder nearly brushed against Rio’s as she stood by her side. She dipped her head down, lips a ghost near her skin. Rio swore she could feel their warmth on her cheek. </p><p> </p><p>The more she thought about it, the feeling was nothing more a wish. Rio wished for her lips to touch every inch of her, to feel how soft they looked, figure out the way they tasted-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Oh, this was a bad idea. You hate her. Remember, you fucking hate her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio closed her eyes as Agatha’s breathless laugh sent a chill down her spine. She didn’t offer a moments grace to add a raspy, low, slow, </p><p> </p><p>“Aye, aye- <em> Captain” </em></p><p> </p><p>And as if she was never there, Agatha skipped away while humming along to the music above. Rio took a moment to register the guitar. Her heartbeat was still pounding like a bass drum in her own ears. </p><p> </p><p>But as the guitar tuned in? The familiar intro slithered into her ears and tickled her brain?</p><p> </p><p>With Or Without You by U2. One of Rio’s many favorite songs.</p><p> </p><p>She pushed off the floor to follow Agatha down to the registers. Rio smirked subtly to herself, watching her hips sway to the smooth tempo. Every step she took added something more to it. The woman would have to wipe the smirk away within a few moments, but for now she’d let it stay. Take advantage of the soft moment to let her eyes linger on the woman she always tried to ignore.  </p><p> </p><p>As they walked, the introduction to the song continued to progress. Rio had listened to it so many times throughout her life, but for some reason? The opening guitar riff sounded different. <em> Special, </em>even. Rio wondered if it was just a remastered version. Maybe the crappy speakers that barely worked.</p><p>Only when the first lyric broke out in the static sound, Agatha’s voice singing softly to it, </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “See the stone set in your eyes..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The memory hit Rio then. No, exploded and shot, kicked and hammered Rio all right there and then. The time Wanda told her life felt different when she met Natasha, her now wife. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “What do you mean different?” Rio snickered.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Everything!” Wanda beamed with a laugh. “Just, the world was lighter. People sounded lighter. Music sounded..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Lighter?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “No..” Wanda shook her head, contemplating it before looking up with a soft smile. “Special. Especially the first time we listened to a song together, it…it just felt like the start of something new. A new adventure, something special I-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda snapped her fingers, nearly dropping the red wine glass in her hand from how giddy her mannerisms were.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I got it!” She exclaimed. “It’ll feel like you were born” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio chuckled.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I don’t remember being born, dumbass. None of us do unless you’re like some…crazy memory freak or something, I don’t know” She shrugged. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “No, no” Wanda shook her head. “Not like that, I mean…you’ll feel like your life is just starting..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “My life is-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Oh my god, Rio!” She yelled out. “Stop being so logical, for two seconds. See? This is why the universe doesn’t hear you. You aren’t open to it!” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “By just pointing out the obvious?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda pushed up to her feet, placing the wine down on the coffee table as she paced around the room. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Oh, come on. Where are you go-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The sound of books crashed against the floor. Wanda dropped to her knees, picking through before a- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Aha!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She jumped back up, rushing over to crash on the couch beside Rio.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Our highschool yearbo-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda shushed her, bringing a hand up to cover her mouth. Rio snickered, licking her palm which made the other woman cringe and yell how gross she was. During it though, Wanda still made sure to flip through the yearbook until she landed on the sports section.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Alright, check this out”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Hm?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda pointed to their old soccer team. Both shoulder to shoulder in the back row smiling big.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Yes, we played together,” Rio said. “What does this have to do with-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “The action shots. Look. There’s me running behind you..” Her finger slithered across the page, landing on the goalie. “And that’s-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Holy fuck, that’s..Natasha!” Rio sat up with a laugh. “When did you figure this shit out?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The woman shrugged. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Honestly, it’s been such a blur since we started dating-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Because you live in her bedsheets?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Butttt!” Wanda spoke over her with a glare. “My point is..trust the universe” </em>
</p><p><em><br />
</em> <em> Rio stared, wondering how much her friend had to drink. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “So..I need to keep an eye on all my yearbooks? How does this relate to you telling me to cut it out with the realistic shit?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda shook her head, reaching forward to pick her wine back up.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Because,” She started. “The universe works in ways we don’t understand. It’s not like you and I were small town kids. Natasha was constantly moving as well. What were the chances for her to be right there? To be in the same photo in our yearbook as us?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda took a sip, continuing on right after, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You gotta’ just accept there’s no logic going into destiny, fate, the universe…all of it” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “And when it happens, I’ll feel like I’m being pushed out of my mother’s vagina all over again?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda scrunched her nose in disgust as she playfully smacked her shoulder. Rio fell into a fit of laughter.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Just! Ugh, stop it with the realism and trying to push it” Wanda shrugged, looking over with a warm smile. “When the universe sends you that special someone…you’ll feel it” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio hummed, taking a swig from her beer.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Good thing the universe doesn’t send me shit to feel. Just…annoying women like Agatha fuckin’ Harkness” She grumbled.  </em>
</p><p><em><br />
</em> <em> Wanda shrugged.  </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Who knows, that could be the universe’s person for-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio belted out a laugh.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “And on that note, I’m going to grab another beer!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She pushed up from the couch as Wanda rolled her eyes over her theatrics.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You’ve met her like once, Rio. The new semester hasn’t even started yet!” She exclaimed. “Who knows, you two could fall in loveeeee!” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio made gagging noises as she left the room. The woman never knew Wanda mumble a few words under her breath in a mockery voice,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “It’s going to be Agatha…I know these things, idiot..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha placed her items up on the self checkout. She scanned them one by one, carelessly singing under her breath to every lyric. Rio’s plan was to rip her eyes off when Agatha didn’t have her back turned to her. However, with her old conversation with Wanda in her mind, U2 and Agatha singing the lyrics-</p><p> </p><p>It felt impossible to look away. Rio tried telling herself this had to be a facade, placebo effect. Maybe her emotions were playing pretend because everything was lining up to Wanda’s words. </p><p> </p><p>The song made her feel like life was beginning for the first time in her life. </p><p>Agatha Harkness, her sworn enemy and most annoying person, was radiating this beautiful light. The world around her felt lighter, happier. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It can’t be her.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, snapping Rio out of her daze to realize she had been holding her hand up to her. She had her lips pulled back, fingers curling back to gesture to herself. </p><p> </p><p>“What uh…wha-”</p><p> </p><p>“C’mon, let me scan them”</p><p> </p><p>“No?” Rio asked, wondering if Agatha had gone insane. “I- You aren’t-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, reaching over to snatch the basket and pint of ice cream from her hand. Just as she did so, their fingers brushed and Wanda’s other words had gone off like alarm whistles in her ears,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “And then she touched me..” Wanda recalled. “My whole body just, lit up…it was like being electrocuted but…in the best way possible” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt goosebumps rising up all over her skin. Her eyes began to sting with the sensation of tears threatening her once again. Not because of hatred for the universe, wondering why she wasn’t lucky enough in this lifetime to fall in love, and the being stood up part? Long forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>Tears wanted to break free, roll down her cheeks all over again because of the realization there was a burning buzzing through her veins. One that wasn’t painful, but didn’t help her anxiety or anything else going on in her mind at all. </p><p> </p><p>She felt her kneecaps weaken, heart palpitate while her skin vibrated. A piece of her wanted to chalk it up to the sweet offer Agatha was giving her by purchasing her snacks and ice cream. However, Rio knew better than that. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t Agatha buying her things..it was-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You’ll know when it’s her..you’ll just feel it and know it, Rio”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched Agatha place their items in two bags. One was passed to Rio, the other held in her own grip as Agatha ripped the receipt from the printer. </p><p> </p><p>“Alright” Agatha sighed with a smile. “Follow along now, don’t get lost” She winked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded because words didn’t exist anymore. Somehow her feet moved, keeping up with Agatha’s pace as they left the store. The cool air helped settle the vibration through her body, but what it couldn’t help? Rio’s racing thoughts repeating the same thing. </p><p> </p><p><em> Is it really going to be her? No..it can’t. </em> </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was being nice. Agatha found her crying in the ice cream section, and offered her a shoulder to lean on. She was buying her items out of pity and kindness. Besides, the woman flirts with everyone. Rio wasn’t special. She always knew that.</p><p> </p><p>Not to mention, it was clear Rio had hurt her in a way or two. Agatha had never shown that side of her before. Hell, Rio didn’t know that piece of her actually existed. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She told herself as they approached the car. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It’s not her. The universe would not send me my enemy to fall in love with.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Rio” </p><p> </p><p>The woman jumped, turning on a whim to see Agatha had stopped walking a few steps ago. Rio forced a small laugh, but it was pathetic and didn’t sound like anything. </p><p> </p><p>“Change your mind?”</p><p> </p><p>“No! No, uh..” Rio walked back, stammering out the words with a shrug. “Force of habit” She landed on. </p><p> </p><p>Luckily, Agatha bought it and didn’t seem to want to dive into where Rio’s mind had truly been. She gestured to the black Ford explorer. The car Rio knew all too well because it was where her eyes went to in the parking lot each morning. She wasn’t sure when she started making sure Agatha’s car was there, but the habit was one that never died.</p><p> </p><p>“Good..” Agatha nodded. “You’d be a chicken shit otherwise. I would’ve had to get you a chicken suit and all” </p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, forcing out a monotone, </p><p> </p><p>“Funny” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked as she walked over, brushing against Rio’s back to round the back of the car. She opened the passenger side door, placing her bag on the floor before tossing what Rio assumed was clothes in the backseat. </p><p> </p><p>After a moment or so, the woman leaned back and stepped to the side. Theatrically, she waved her arm with a little bow, </p><p> </p><p>“Your throne awaits”</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t help but laugh over that. A genuine one, not a fake or sarcastic response to shut the woman up. </p><p> </p><p>“Such a charmer..” She said. </p><p> </p><p>She hopped into the passenger seat, holding her breath as Agatha shut the door behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio took in the interior in the dim light. Only a few wrappers scattered, eyeliner and lip gloss in one of the cupholders caught her eye more than anything. She always looked at the car, the woman who drove or stepped in and out of it. Rio just never thought she’d be sitting <em> in </em>the car. Especially with Agatha in the driver’s seat. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Holy shit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She was going to be in a car with her. Rio was going to be hanging out with her fucking enemy. Reality was all hitting fast, but abruptly stopped the second the door opened with the chirpy, </p><p> </p><p>“Alrighty” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed as she pulled the car door shut. As she turned the key in the ignition, Rio felt her heart jump again for what felt like the millionth time. Especially as reality had dawned on her where she was, who was beside her and how the entire night had led up to this point. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> How did being stood up lead me here?  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I told Wanda Tinder was a bad idea..</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Now typically, Vidal. I do have rules for my car” Agatha started. “But..maybe I’ll make you the exception or…you can be <em> my </em>little rule breaker?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt an ache shoot between her legs over the words Agatha chose. Part of her wondered if Agatha knew exactly what she was doing. Was she feeling everything Rio felt? </p><p> </p><p>From the music, electric touch, everything was lighter and now the familiar thunder of arousal that felt far worse now! </p><p> </p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat. Rio then forced an annoyed smile as she nodded. No words came out, but luckily Agatha had gotten distracted by trying to find them spoons for their ice cream. </p><p> </p><p>Rio knew she had to break the silence, find her footing and regain the strength she had within her. It was somewhere just…buried beneath the surface, maybe extinct. Wherever it had landed, Rio was determined to find it. The only problem was one repeating thought kept screaming in her mind the loudest,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> What if it’s been Agatha all along?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>...Fuck my life...</em>

  <p>
    <em>"If you're feeling down<br />
I just wanna make you happier, baby<br />
Wish I was around<br />
I just wanna make you happier, baby<br />
<br />
We've been doing all this late night talking<br />
'Bout anything you want until the morning<br />
Now you're in my life<br />
I can't get you off my mind"</em>
  </p>
</blockquote><hr /><p><br />
<em> Rio leaned her elbows on the bar, trying to muffle the consistent chatter and music that surrounded her. She didn’t want to be out of bed let alone in public with people at every turn. Especially ones she worked with that expected and damn near required her to be social.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The break up with her ex was still fresh. A wound that barely began to truly heal. It was back in June, right at the end of the last semester everything came crashing down.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She wasn’t happy, plain and simple. It didn’t make sense to her how she could feel the break up cut deep. Wanda tried to explain how it was only reasonable for her to grieve what was. They were together for nearly a year, talking about plans for the future and a possible family.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> But, Rio ruined it. Maybe the wound was still there from that.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She hurt someone close to her, someone who saw the good parts when Rio only ever could spot the bad. Wanda was there, she would attempt to tell her it was okay to walk away. Hell, it was only fair. Even if she hurt her, it’d be worse in the long run for Rio to walk into marriage and a family while still feeling empty inside.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio was always picky with the people she surrounded herself with. An introvert who did everything to avoid social situations such as the one she was currently trapped in. With that, when she felt someone wasn’t good for her to be around (Even if nothing in particular was wrong with them), she felt the weight of it heavy on her shoulders. In her gut, there was a knot that tightened day by day. The words screaming in her mind how this wasn’t her person to spend eternity with.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “It’ll always be this”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She remembered sobbing, choking the words out while her head rested in Wanda’s lap. Her ex had collected the last of her belongings and it dawned on her then how once again- A woman wasn't the one for Rio to love. She didn’t feel loved or seen in the way her mind and heart desired.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “It’ll happen..there’s some lunatic out there who will put up with you”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda had said those words for years and fuck, Rio was growing tired of hearing them.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio glanced at her phone screen, seeing her chat with Wanda still open. The last text she was somewhat ignoring still remained.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://archive.org/download/received_1058668312843520/received_1058668312843520.png" alt="WandaRiotexts" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
</p><p>
  <em> Just as Rio was about to pick up her phone, let her thumbs tap away begging for Wanda to save her from this hell hole-  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “And over here!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Lilia’s voice rang in Rio's ears, stopping her from replying to Wanda.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Dammit. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Instead subtly dropped her head in defeat, locked the phone and counted down from three before she faced the two behind her. Rio had known Lilia for years, far past her start date as a professor. They went way back into her childhood years when the older woman had lived down the street from her. Safe to say? She knew when Lilia was dragging someone along to meet her.   </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio turned from the bartender to follow it. A warm smile, ready to chat away with whoever Lilia felt she needed to meet and- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Holy shit.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She didn’t realize how oxygen could be stripped from you so aggressively. Rio had been starstruck by beautiful women countless times before. Gay panic, Wanda said or whatever the hell it was called. Regardless, Rio never felt the sudden rush through her. How everything else around them blurred, only the woman before her was clear as day.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Isn’t that right?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Lilia nudged Rio’s arms, snapping her out of the strong daze. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “This is Professor Harkness,” She introduced. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Lilia had gone on to say something about the English department, but fuck Rio didn't hear her let alone care. She already knew somewhat where the woman would be working, but Rio never knew who it’d be.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She would’ve never guessed either this would be her reaction.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> LIlia went on to joke about how Rio was a witch with nature. A force to be reckoned with when the landscapers on campus were in her vision. Typically, Rio would be flattered and acknowledge such comments with wits of her own humor. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> However, she was distracted and seemingly- So was the new professor.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The older woman wasn’t blind and Rio knew that, but she chose to ignore that. Without a doubt, Lilia was seeing the way the two stared each other down. Both in their own world, exploring each other’s eyes, never breaking apart.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Well..” Lilia drew the word out, taking a step back. “I see uh, I’m needed over by Professor Kale. We both know how she gets with..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Did Lilia complete her excuse to walk away? Rio wasn’t sure. All she knew was Harkness now stood alone before her. A small smile was growing on her lips, eyes let go to roam up and down Rio’s body which suddenly felt small- Even if she was a slight inch taller than the woman.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Vidal,”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Her voice was something extraordinary. A sound Rio had never heard, a blessing to be introduced to. The way her name rolled off her tongue, it glided with ease and ran smoothly in the space between them.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “The meaning of life?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> As if her voice alone wasn’t enough- Her knowledge stepped out with power. A force that took Rio aback. No one ever guessed or cared to know the meaning of her last name. Hell, it never seemed anyone was interested in the five letter word.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Is uh..” Rio straightened her back, taking a sip of her drink before tilting her beer forward. “Studying words, a hobby of yours?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The woman smirked, a small shrug followed with a small, </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Only to impress beautiful women like yourself”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Before Rio was able to digest the flirtatious comment- The woman’s hand was extended and she introduced herself with confidence that radiated power throughout the room, maybe the entire city to every continent.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Agatha Harkness”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio nodded, lifting her hand that was trembling as adrenaline coursed through her entire body. Their first touch was electric- A vibration that trembled Rio down to her core through the floorboards beneath her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Rio Vidal”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She managed to introduce herself within a few seconds, but the way Agatha was smirking- Did she see the fluster through her warm cheeks? How Rio was becoming a mess under her stare? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Rio”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha echoed with a soft smile, slowly nodding before asking,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “So…you're a green witch?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wha- Oh, shit, Lilia…course…Rio thought to herself.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> The older woman had called her The Green Witch since she took over Lilia’s garden back in middle school. What started as a science project turned into something spectacular. Lilia would always laugh, saying how she (Who had years of gardening experience) never managed to make the flowers and plants blossom the way Rio could. </em> <em><br />
<br />
</em></p><p>
  <em> From that moment on, Rio earned the nickname that she secretly adored.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She cleared her throat, adjusting her shirt as she stood a bit taller.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Um..” Rio shrugged. “Less a green witch, more The Green Witch”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha puffed out a small laugh, shaking her head and Rio thought she stuck the landing. Maybe this conversation, meeting, party- It wasn’t bad after all. The only downside was she’d have to tell Wanda how she was right, but..that was the last thing on her mind.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Ego filled thing, aren't you?” Agatha asked. “I’m sure I’ve seen better” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Oh.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio wasn’t sure if Agatha meant for her comment to come off harsh. Did she realize the attitude that covered each word? How she sounded absolutely disgusted with her?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Or…was Rio just thinking too much into it? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Most likely, it was the second, but..Rio’s insecurities weren’t always good remaining on the surface. Especially fresh off a break up and from a woman who was dominating the air around them.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She narrowed her eyes, watching the way Agatha looked so smug and something in her stomach kicked. A switch was flipped, the sparks flew but not in the way it did before.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “What makes you so sure?” Rio questioned.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha shrugged, taking another sip of her drink.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I know these things” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “So..you know how much of an asshole you sound like right now?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> That seemed to eliminate the smug look on her face. Instead, it was replaced with shock and Rio was able to take the step above- Finally.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “This usually work for you?” Rio gestured between them. “Just…insulting someone off the bat?”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha clicked her tongue, head tilting to the side as she tapped her fingers against the wine glass.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “What? Are you not like other girls?” The woman asked. “Don’t like to be brought back down to earth a little bit?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio laughed, rolling her eyes as she shook her head.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You don’t even know who I am to be making the call if I need to be brought back down to earth to begin with” She argued.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I know ‘em when I see ‘em” Agatha shrugged.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Wow,” Rio said. “I could say the same about you being an asshole right about now-” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “You could or will?” Agatha smirked.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio paused before she scoffed, pushing her back off the bar to storm past the woman. She let their shoulders punch against one another, muttering under her breath,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Fuck off, Harkness..” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Little did Rio know that’d become her new mantra for years to come... </em>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>“Rules for your car?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t sure how she thought of the words, but she sure as shit wasn’t going to question it. Somehow, she’d managed to pull herself together…well, and least somewhat. </p><p> </p><p>Between the adrenaline coursing through her veins as if the emotion was her blood. How Wanda’s cursed words bounced around her brain, preaching the universe held its own magical ways. And Agatha’s <em> fucking </em>little flirts suddenly feeling as if she’d push Rio off the edge of glory. </p><p><br />
She always flirted with her. Annoyingly, that was. Why was Rio feeling different all of the sudden? Sure, she always felt a bit flustered and even turned on against her own wishes at times. But this was another level, an intense feeling that only grew with everyone. </p><p> </p><p>“Mhm” Agatha hummed. </p><p> </p><p>The older woman scoffed, suffocating her true feelings the best she could. </p><p> </p><p>“You're joking..” Rio muttered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickered. </p><p> </p><p>“Far from it” </p><p> </p><p>The younger woman continued to rummage through her center console for plastic spoons. Both had forgotten to grab some for their ice cream, too distracted by one another to remember. But, Agatha had insisted she had them somewhere. Rio assumed she must’ve stored them from different drive thru’s and such. </p><p> </p><p>Which felt <em> very </em>Agatha. Rio wasn’t surprised to see her car was complete and total chaos. However, how the fuck did a hot mess have rules for her car?</p><p> </p><p>“I’d give you a rundown, but your tears are excusing you from it” Agatha waved her hand towards her as if she tossed the rules away. </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed. </p><p> </p><p>“What? Do they excuse me from signing a waiver as well?” She asked with her tone covered in sarcasm. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped shut the center console in defeat. She dropped her head, shaking it subtly before silently hissing a small, </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Shoot!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The woman then looked up, meeting Rio’s eyes as she added on a slow,</p><p> </p><p>“I knew I forgot something at home..” She sighed. “I’ll email you the documents tonight. Just sign them and send it back to me” </p><p> </p><p>Easily, Agatha had dragged Rio in another moment where she wondered if the joke was serious or not. Though the confusion didn’t last long as that sickening wide grin crept up slowly. The one that confirmed Agatha was in fact joking and there was no car rule contract. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Course.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>This is what drove Rio mad at times. Agatha was so good at lying, joking, pulling one over you without any energy needed. Rio swore Agatha didn’t know how to go twenty four hours (Let alone a fucking second) without making some kind of joke out of a situation. </p><p> </p><p>“Ha. Ha” Rio’s voice was monotone as she rolled her eyes. “I knew there was no way you had rules for your car-”</p><p> </p><p>“Now that,” Agatha pointed. “That is actually truthful”</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio was able to reply- Agatha leaned over to pull down the glove box. Which would be fine, but it was the position she had put Rio in. One moment Agatha was on her own side of the car. The next her shoulder nearly brushed against Rio’s lap, hair just below Rio’s chin, sparking that same electric sensation as before. </p><p> </p><p>This time the feeling was stronger, more powerful as their close proximity was in a compact space. </p><p> </p><p>The lavender with a hint of vanilla conditioner wavered through the air, sneaking up into Rio’s nose. She had to hold her breath to keep her composure. Plus, Agatha was laced through the conditioner. The woman carried something of her own. A smell Rio couldn’t figure out, but could only describe it as, </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, here we go!” Agatha exclaimed, snapping Rio out of her shock. </p><p> </p><p>The woman leaned back as if she was never over Rio’s lap, untouched by any emotions that Rio was overwhelmed with. Part of Rio fell into jealousy, but also embarrassed as fuck because it was clearly, <em> just her. </em>Agatha wasn’t phased, she wasn’t feeling the chaos of emotions Rio had been since she agreed to join her in the car. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha held up the spoon wrapped in plastic, a smile of achievement matching it. Rio muttered a small thank you, taking it from her to rip the plastic off. She balled it up, placing it in her lap before taking the seal off her ice cream. </p><p> </p><p>The older woman’s mind was still swimming in Agatha’s orbit. The warmth in the air over her lap grew cold with the abrupt absence. She hadn’t even spent more than fifteen seconds and Rio was drowning as if Agatha trapped her for hours. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Go back to the rules.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Get out of your head with this.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Focus. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Nice try,” Rio said, clearing her throat right after. “For a woman who barely holds standards and rules for a classroom, there’s no possible way you-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rule number one!” Agatha cut off, holding a finger in the air. “Thou shall not complain about my driving”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Oh my god.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I’m not going anywhere with you. So..that rule is pointless right now” Rio argued. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but continued on as if Rio hadn’t said anything at all.</p><p> </p><p>“Number two,” She continued. “Thou shall not criticize the car’s possessions. She likes stuff, clothes and random objects one wouldn’t think to carry, but end up needing anyway! Hence the spoons” She tilted her head with a smirk at the end. </p><p> </p><p>Rio peeled the lid off her ice cream, leaning forward to flip it upside and rest on the dashboard. She sat back, crossing a leg over the other when she realized-</p><p> </p><p>“Wait..” She said, rolling her head over slowly to see Agatha busy with her own wrapper. “<em> She </em> as in who? You or-”</p><p> </p><p>“<em> She </em> as in the vehicle you are sitting in right this very moment”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Yep. That’s what I thought. She really is insane.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You gave your car a gender?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped, smacking a hand over her heart as she shook her head before looking at her with disgust.</p><p> </p><p>“Professor Vidal, she is more than just a gender!” She exclaimed. “She has a name!”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh!” Rio laughed, digging into her ice cream because she needed some kind of vice to continue putting up with this. “And what would that name be, hm?”</p><p> </p><p>She hummed, slipping the spoon past her lips to let the frozen treat greet her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think you deserve the honors to know” Agatha huffed, returning her attention to peel the lid off her ice cream. </p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered, shaking her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Because there is no name”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, there is,” Agatha argued.</p><p> </p><p>“No, there isn’t” Rio countered. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes. There. Is” </p><p> </p><p>“If there was, you’d give up the name”</p><p> </p><p>“I just said you don’t get to know-”</p><p> </p><p>“Which is something one would say when it’s a bullshit lie!” </p><p> </p><p>“Ugh, fine!” Agatha groaned. “It’s Violet. Named after one of my favorite shades of purple” </p><p> </p><p>Rio paused, watching as Agatha took a small dig in her own ice cream. No humor or smirk to prove otherwise. She was serious. Her car had a gender, rules, and was named after not just her favorite color- But, one of many <em> shades </em>of it. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re so lame” She shook her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, as if you aren’t yourself!” Agatha exclaimed. </p><p> </p><p>“My car doesn’t have a name” Rio rolled her eyes. “So, I don’t think I’m the lame one here,” She added. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha worked to finish her bite of ice cream, waving her spoon in the air as she swallowed before replying, </p><p> </p><p>“No, but it is commonly known on campus how <em> Professor Green Witch </em> views all her plants as her children” Agatha argued. “Don’t sit here and tell me you did <em> not </em>baby talk that little cactus”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s cheeks began to burn. She took another bite of the ice cream while hiding her face. Agatha snorted, crumbling up the plastic with a small,</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm! That’s what I thought”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever, continue on with <em> Violet’s </em>rules” She said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio caught a glimpse of Agatha’s ice cream container. The Ben and Jerry’s chocolate chip design dim in the parking lot’s light. Before Agatha was able to carry on, Rio realized then? She had more ammunition to shoot at her for who was the lame one. </p><p> </p><p>“Wait, wait” Rio laughed, pointing over with a strong, “You insult my rocky road, think I am the lame one, but get fucking chocolate chip?!” </p><p> </p><p>The younger woman looked down at her ice cream, shrugging with a tiny smile. No teasing, taunting, none of it lined up behind that grin. The dim parking lot lights casting soft rays through the windshield offered Rio access to see the subtle pink shading Agatha’s cheeks. She looked away as if she caught on to Rio catching it, hiding herself as she scooped up her own bite of ice cream. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s a classic,” She pointed out. </p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s boring and lame”</p><p> </p><p>“Like you?” Agatha rolled her head over, a tiny grin while popping the spoon between her lips. </p><p> </p><p>And suddenly Rio was jealous of a spoon getting to feel and taste something that she desired. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No. No. That’s not what this is, shut up.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked away in a hurry, desperate to derail the conversation back to where they previously were. Agatha seemed to feel the same as she took the lead to do so. </p><p> </p><p>“And number three,” She said, drawing out the silence as if it were anticipation. “Thou shall not control the music when it is not their car”</p><p> </p><p>Right after she stated the final rule (Or what Rio assumed was the last one), Agatha reached for her phone and unlocked the screen. She navigated with a few taps, passing it over for Rio to see the Spotify home screen staring up at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Aka, the rule I am eliminating for thee” Agatha smiled. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at the phone, feeling her heart kick up once again. Not because of the Spotify app, but it was the way Agatha had said she was eliminating the rule for her. </p><p> </p><p>The woman was offering for Rio to choose the music. Her voice telling her that was soft, delicate, brought warmth into Rio’s heart and- </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> This is out of pity.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha found her crying in the ice cream section- This. Is. Out. Of. Pity. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She flirts with everyone and nothing about this is special.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I am not special to her.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I’m her enemy.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> I hate her.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> She knows it.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The older woman cleared her throat, tightening up her shoulders before letting them drop with a low, </p><p> </p><p>“In exchange for..?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked confused for a moment, wondering what she meant by that. She shook her head, lips pursed in a tiny pout as she replied, </p><p> </p><p>“No exchanges,” Agatha said. “Nor a trick,” She added. “Just a trial”</p><p> </p><p>“A trial?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed, looking back up at Agatha who had her eyes locked on her as if she was the most interesting thing in the world. <em> Fuck </em>, that didn’t help anything about this. </p><p> </p><p>“Of what?” Rio managed to choke out. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked as if she expected Rio to ask more questions. </p><p> </p><p>“If you have immaculate or pathetic music taste” Agatha nudged her phone at her. “Come on, now. Chop chop”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated before she caved and took the phone out of Agatha’s hand. She placed the pint of ice cream in her lap, both hands free to let her thumbs search for an artist. </p><p> </p><p>The amount of pressure that weighed on her to choose something good was heavy. She thought about what song would make Agatha want to talk to her more, but at the same time? The annoyance, resentment, and hatred still ran deep. Denial wasn’t a river in Egypt to her quite yet. Rio was holding on to what she knew for three years and pissing or annoying Agatha was her plan. </p><p> </p><p>Well…so she thought, anyway because unbeknownst to Rio? She was already going to choose a song Agatha would like. Even if she wasn’t thinking about doing so. Her heart was ruling over her mind. The secret villain in her pulling all the strings. </p><p> </p><p>She typed in the words, clicking the song before passing the phone back to Agatha who was leaning forward to turn the volume up. The intro began and the title on her dashboard came to life. Rio picked up her ice cream, taking a frantic nervous bite as she awaited Agatha’s response. </p><p> </p><p>A puff of air left Agatha with a tiny scoff when she read the words, </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For </em>
</p><p>
  <em>                             U2” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“More U2, huh?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>“I always leave this store listening to this kind of music,” Rio shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>“Not a bad thing” Agatha hummed, bobbing her head to the soft beat. </p><p> </p><p>They let the music fill the silence for a bit. Agatha had grabbed her phone, opening to the song’s radio so the one song wouldn’t play on repeat. But, they’d still have the same vibe as it. </p><p> </p><p>Though, when the song was closing in to the end- Agatha broke the unspoken minutes between them to break the glass and ask- </p><p> </p><p>“So..are we going to talk about the tears in the ice cream aisle or what?” </p><p><br />
Rio snapped her head over, eyes wide as she shook her head frantically. </p><p> </p><p>“What? No. You said we’d listen to music. That was it”</p><p> </p><p>“I say a lot of things,” Agatha snickered. “Besides, I feel like that plan was eliminated when one was sobbing at ice cream. Who cries over ice cream?”</p><p>Rio stared wide, suddenly feeling her stomach and feeling sick because she could <em> not </em>talk to Agatha about this. It was one thing agreeing to hang out with her, but another to admit to the woman who already gave her hell left and right her Tinder date stood her up. And Rio just knew Agatha would never let that go. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s..no,” Rio said before chuckling over the idea of even saying anything about it. “I can <em> not </em>talk to you about this”</p><p> </p><p>“Is it work related?” Agatha questioned. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. </p><p> </p><p>“No..”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, that’s a surprise”</p><p> </p><p>“What’s that supposed to mean?” </p><p> </p><p>“Isn’t everything in your life related to the university?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes because <em> great </em>, this topic. Wanda, Lilia, even Jennifer had jumped on her from time to time over it. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You should live life outside of work” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Work doesn’t need to be what you live and breathe” </em>
</p><p><em> “Won’t you regret spending all your life on work one day?” </em> </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t think it’s a bad thing, Rio” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wait, what? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“If anything, it’s admirable” </p><p> </p><p>Rio fell into a deeper pit of disbelief because Agatha Harkness, the woman who teased and taunted her every second they were near one another. She always seemed to like poking fun, digging under her skin to push every button that would aggravate her nerves. </p><p> </p><p>How the hell was she not making fun of Rio for such a thing? She insulted her teaching methods left and right. Rio remembered well the first argument the two had ever gotten into. It was during a get together with the others for drinks. Agatha and Rio sat across from one another at the table. She couldn’t remember exactly what sparked it, but she knew Agatha lit the flames between them. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Well, I like to make sure students don’t fall asleep in my class. Professor Vidal, you should take notes from that. Don’t you think?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Oh shit..” Alice mumbled behind her drink.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio snapped her head up, eyes narrow as her lips slowly curled into a smirk. One that was vicious, venom on her tongue ready to poison the air between them.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha Harkness was already someone she couldn’t stand to be around. Her voice was loud, annoying and way too much for her low energy to handle. And now she was going after her teaching methods?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Is that so?” Rio asked. “Are your students even there to learn? Or do they just want an excuse to have a party mid day?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha snorted through her little laugh. The one that made Rio’s stomach flip and irritated her both at once.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “My students like learning because I make it lively and fun. Yours on the other hand, well” She shrugged, taking a pause so she could sip her wine before continuing. “We all have heard you’d much rather be kind to your plants over stu-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Oh!” Rio laughed. “Really? Because I hear students that don’t even give a shit about the material they’d learn in your class. You’re just eye candy to them” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You think I’m eye candy then?” Agatha smirked like the devil, threatening to strip Rio’s soul right then and there.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> This bitch...Rio muttered in her mind.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The woman scoffed before she slammed down the rest of her wine in one swallow, pulling her wallet out to leave cash before abruptly standing up.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Guys..” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Rio, sit down” </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “C’mon”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The others piled words over the other, but Rio was having none of it.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “No, no” Rio put her hands up. “It’s fine. At least I can sleep knowing I’m teaching my students something over just letting them stare at my ass and party all semester” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio never stayed to hear what Agatha had to say. Instead, she stormed off without looking back. She rarely agreed to go out for drinks or attend dinners with them after that. Which part of her was thankful Agatha ever did that. Even if it was wine induced or God knows what. It gave her an excuse to stay home and that’s all she could really ask for. </p><p> </p><p>“I mean, come on. Remember our professors? How many genuinely <em> craved </em>teaching others? You’re beyond passionate about fucking plants too. I mean, hell, I didn’t know one could view them as humans. Do they actually have feelings?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her cheeks flame red, looking down and wondering all over again when Agatha’s switch had flipped. She wasn’t insulting her teaching style, but this time admiring it. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> This is all out of pity, has to be.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>But hey, if Agatha wanted to ask about plants? Rio could never deny that topic. She could be speaking to the most evil human on earth and if they asked her something related to nature, she’d be more than happy to discuss. </p><p> </p><p>“I mean..” Rio shrugged. “Realistically? No. They don’t” </p><p> </p><p>Without thinking, Rio found herself perking up in her seat as her worlds began to spill uncontrollably. No filter, no breaks, just an unstoppable train that ran off on it’s own. </p><p> </p><p>“However, I’d like to think since they are living creatures- <em> Yes, </em>creatures, they are that to me. They need water and oxygen just as we do to stay alive and they grow and lose life just as we do and so maybe, yeah, I’d like to think they could potentially have feelings and emotions. Maybe we just aren’t meant to figure that out…but, I always uh..”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head over to see Agatha with a gawking stare her way. Movements frozen, lips sealed shut as they slowly were pulled back between her teeth in what Rio would guess was an attempt to not burst out laughing. </p><p> </p><p>Embarrassment flooded her when realization dawned on her. Agatha was joking just like always. She didn’t care or want to know. Rio just couldn’t shut the fuck up and not make a fool of herself over a stupid fixation. Since a kid, this had hjaoppened. No one ever wanted to actually know how insane she was when it came to her plants.  </p><p> </p><p>Especially the woman she couldn’t stand. </p><p> </p><p>“You were…joking, right-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snickered, confirming Rio’s doom was approaching sooner than expected. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, kinda’ but…” She shrugged. “Not going to argue that theory of yours. You could be right, who knows?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sunk into the seat, suddenly not hungry and regretting every bite she took. Agathha must’ve seen it written all over her the way her words rushed out.  </p><p> </p><p>“But, nice to hear this isn’t work related and you do have a life outside of the university” She said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She was too busy debating jumping out of the car, abandon the snacks Agatha had purchased for her. Maybe even skipping town without a bag packed or a look behind her.  </p><p> </p><p>“I won’t tell a single soul what is said in this car” Agatha said. “Scouts honor” She held up her hand. </p><p> </p><p>Rio chewed on the inside of her cheek, debating if it was worth even admitting to. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I mean…it’d make her forget how much of a loser I sounded like over stupid fucking plants.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No, no. What are you thinking?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Don’t do it.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She’ll never let it go more than sobbing in the fucking store.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Do not- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Tonight was- I’m supposed to be at a..dinner. Woman from fucking Tinder” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Andddd, you’re resigning and leaving the country.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted and Rio’s heart flipped upside down, ready to drop beneath the pavement below them. </p><p> </p><p>“If you’re going to laugh at me, I swear Ag-”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t think you’re the only one that’s happened to, right?” Agatha asked, almost condescendingly. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Bitch.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, totally” Rio rolled her eyes. “Jesus, is this another insult? Are you calling me self centered right now? I’m not saying this as some <em> woe is me </em>shit or-”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m saying it because I was stood up tonight as well. Jesus..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s words created a silence between them. Just the soft background noise of Time After Time by Cyndi Lauper through the car speakers. Rio looked closely, making sure this wasn’t one of Agatha’s tricks. If it was, it’d be a brutal one. That’s for sure. But as Agatha focused on stabbing her spoon in the ice cream, shaking her head while muttering,</p><p> </p><p>“Why else do you think I’m in the fucking ice cream section begging the co worker who hates me the most to sit in my car with me?”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She’s serious.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You’re lying..” Rio mumbled. </p><p> </p><p>It was a last effort attempt to figure out this was just another cruel joke of her’s. Agatha just scoffed, shrugging as she spoke, </p><p> </p><p>“If I am, hit me with one of those plant vase thingys of yours because that is the most embarrassing lie ever” She huffed. </p><p> </p><p><em> “Vase thingys?” </em> Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah they look heavy…breakable” Agatha said. “Regardless, I was supposed to be on a date myself. Not sure what happened. She cancelled like an hour after being late”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh..”</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “The univer-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Shut the fuck up, Wanda.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio thought the words to herself when the memory was about to replay in her mind. How timing and all things related to the universe wasn’t supposed to make sense. It was unpredictable and this felt like something related to all of that. </p><p> </p><p>What were the chances of them both being stood up on the same night?</p><p>How could they possibly decide to grab ice cream at the same store, same night, same time?</p><p> </p><p>All of it screamed the universe had a hand in this game and Rio wasn’t sure what to do with that quite yet. If anything, it terrified the shit out of her because Agatha was her enemy. She was the one woman she fought and bickered, avoided for three years now. Why would the universe choose <em> Agatha </em>of all women that existed?</p><p> </p><p>“What’s your favorite plant?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up when Agatha broke the silence, taking a second to register the question. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” </p><p> </p><p>“A plant? Oh sorry, <em>creature” </em>Agatha smiled a bit as she took another bite, asking again this time with a mouthful of the frozen treat. “Which is your favorite?”</p><p> </p><p>“You…you really want to discuss…<em> plants?”  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother answering the question. Instead answering her own question since Rio didn’t bother to. </p><p> </p><p>“Mine would be the azalea flowers, purple specifically. My mother hated them with a passion and they always grew in our garden against her will. Witchcraft shit, really” She snorted. “I’ve adored them since-”</p><p> </p><p>“You adore something your mother hated?” </p><p> </p><p>A weight dropped upon them. The energy in the car shifted into something tense. A heavier energy Rio wasn’t quite able to narrow down the reason for, but..she could tell Agatha became very uncomfortable. It was a new look she wore. Something Rio had never seen in the three years of knowing her. </p><p> </p><p>Whatever it was, Rio felt the swift urge to redirect the subject back to her own answer. Rio slowly smirked herself before rasping a low, </p><p> </p><p>“Hemp flower..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze before she snapped her head up, eyebrows furrowed as her lips curled. </p><p> </p><p>“What?” She asked.</p><p> </p><p>“My favorite. It’s-”</p><p> </p><p>“Weed?!” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha cut her off and Rio could only laugh how her voice slightly broke in between. A high pitch crack that sent a tingle down Rio’s spine. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, don’t gasp as if you think it’s the worst thing in this world” Rio shook her head with a wide grin, proud to have caught the woman off guard. </p><p> </p><p>“No, no, not the worst thing- Far from it! Just..” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed with her hand up, readjusting in her seat to face her completely. She put the ice cream in the cupholder, hands together as she grinned like a mad woman. The reaction was adorable even if Rio didn’t want to admit it. </p><p> </p><p>Truthfully as time went by, the more words and longer they spent together- Rio was finding she didn't want to acknowledge or face <em> a lot </em>of things. </p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, Vidal. You are so, way, <em> wayyyy </em> far too uptight to smoke let alone <em> grow </em>fuckin’ weed! There’s no way you-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio took a bite of her ice cream as Agatha was bursting with excitement at the new found information she had on her. She slowly slipped the spoon out of her mouth- A tiny grin formed while rolling her head back over to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“Who do you think Lilia’s dealer is?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>The younger woman gasped as her jaw dropped. She slowly let out a laugh that turned into multiple tiny snorts. One after the other, trying to catch her breath while choking out the words, </p><p> </p><p>“No way!”</p><p> </p><p>“Way” Rio confirmed with a small nod. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat back, eyes glimmering as she took in the new found information about her enemy. The professor who always seemed so angry, stern, distant and cold to ever feel warm beside her. Now here she sat in Agatha’s passenger seat, slowly pulling back the curtain to reveal who Professor Vidal truly was outside of the classroom. </p><p> </p><p>When she saw the stoic, brave, confident woman a wreck in front of ice cream, of course Agatha felt her heart ache a bit. But as the minutes went by, more words were said between them- She couldn’t help but feel thankful for those tears. Who knew they’d lead to a moment like so?</p><p> </p><p>“Well,” Agatha smirked. “Your shit is pretty good. I have to give you that”</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio questioned. </p><p> </p><p>“Lilia offered me to smoke with her one time. Little did I know the devil’s lettuce I was inhaling was crafted by <em> Professor Green Witch </em> herself” </p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed, looking back at her ice cream in hopes Agatha wouldn’t see how her cheeks burned over the little nickname and compliment. Instead, she focused on the name for the marijuana that Agatha used over the other that made her heart flip.</p><p> </p><p>“Devil’s lettuce” She muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s a fun name for it!” Agatha exclaimed, shaking her head with a swift, “Should’ve found you crying in the ice cream section years ago if it meant learning this about such a now <em> shockingly </em>grumpy professor”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re never letting the ice cream section thing go, are you?”</p><p> </p><p>“Smoke with me and find out, <em> professor”  </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She’s going to be the death of me.. </em>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p>The next hour flew by them like a gust of wind. They talked way more than Rio thought could ever be possible. Sure, when they met years ago there was energy between them. But, it had gone sour so quick. Barely reached the top of the mountain before tumbling and spiraling back down. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha told her the latest gossip with her students. Both figured out they had a toxic relationship duo in either class. Rio had the boyfriend, Agatha had the girlfriend. The two laughed as they mocked and rolled their eyes over the students' theatrics with their dramatic fights. Which led into conversations about other students, but both unspokenly skipped over discussing teaching methods. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t know if it was intentional on Agatha’s end to do so, but it surely was on her own. After being stood up, the complex emotions that exhausted her by the second- Rio didn’t want to find herself in an argument with Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>And what she wouldn’t admit to herself quite yet? She didn’t want to stop what was going on between them. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the constant sarcasm and bantering. Neither found a reason to bicker either. Sure, a few insults were tossed back and forth. But it was different compared to their usual. The insults were filled with laughter, feigned annoyance, all of the above. </p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t understand what was going on. All she could chalk it up to was both of them took pity on each other. They had been stood up, finding themselves on a late night trip for junk food to eat their feelings. Agatha had found Rio crying while Rio witnessed Agatha plead for her to hang out. </p><p>They were taking pity on one another and nothing more. That had to be it. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually as the clock teetered towards an hour after midnight, Rio had called it and said she had to get home. Agatha seemed disappointed, but the look didn't last long. Rio assumed it was exhaustion that made her see the delusional reaction, not thinking more on it. </p><p> </p><p>“Thanks uh,” Rio stepped out of the car, looking back up when her feet planted on the concrete. “For this..” She added. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, head tilted back against the seat and <em> oh hell- </em>Rio swore the look made her feel tipsy as if she downed a bottle of jack. Suddenly her mind was swimming in a flood of confusion and wonder, trying to decipher if the tears and tiredness had won or if it was genuinely just Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>The woman looked so content. A lazy smile that Rio never had access to before. She was used to vicious smirks, exaggerated grins everytime she managed to make Rio storm off. Not whatever this was, but…what Rio knew? She loved and hated it more than words can say. </p><p><br />
And what didn’t help the feeling she already had found herself drowning in?</p><p> </p><p>“That woman is a moron, Rio” </p><p> </p><p>She said it so effortlessly as if the thought had been on her mind since Rio told her. The lazy smile had faded, but not in a bad way. Instead she subtly frowned. One that told Rio her words were sincere and again, Rio didn’t know what to do with it. </p><p> </p><p>“Is she?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled her lips back while humming a small, </p><p> </p><p>“Mhm” </p><p> </p><p>But, Rio barely heard it. She was far too aware of how her eyes were watching her every move. How Agatha was burning lasers into her while Rio was quick to busy herself. She grabbed her phone, wallet, making sure she had everything and Agatha was watching her <em> every single move. </em></p><p> </p><p>“She missed out..” </p><p> </p><p>Rio froze for a second before jolting back up. She scanned over her belongings, making sure she had everything. There was a passing thought to leave something so she had an excuse to venture back here. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t leave anything behind (Well…physically, emotionally and mentally was up for debate). </p><p> </p><p>“Yeah..” Rio nodded, clearing her throat a second after. “Also uh, thanks for..buying this” </p><p> </p><p>She held the bag of junk food Agatha had bought her in the air with her words. Agatha perked up in her seat right as she said it, reaching forward to find her keys.  </p><p> </p><p>“Just a pity gift,” Agatha shrugged with a tiny grin. “I’ll see you on Monday and no worries, this never happened” </p><p> </p><p>She tilted her head back up and fucking <em> winked </em>. Rio genuinely was losing her mind and hoped Agatha wasn’t able to see any piece of it. </p><p> </p><p>“Take it easy on yourself, Vidal” </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. </p><p> </p><p>“You too..”</p><p> </p><p>Rio went to shut the door, feeling the vehicle vibrate as Agatha started up the engine. But like a force of nature that held a will of its own, she spun around to add a quick,</p><p> </p><p>“Your ghost was stupid too” She rushed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was in the middle of buckling herself in when she shot her head up, looking like a deer in headlights. It was clear how she didn’t expect it and Rio took some joy out of that. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re annoying, don’t get me wrong,” Rio quickly added. “Like, insufferable and everything, but uh…yeah” She shrugged with a shake of her head. </p><p> </p><p>Slowly Agatha grinned that lazy smile all over again. Her cheeks burned red under the dim light and for a moment Rio thought to herself,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Is she feeling everything just the same? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Ghost..” Agatha echoed the word. “Nice little name for her”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smirked. </p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes I’m good”</p><p> </p><p>“Eh” Agatha shrugged. “Night, Vidal”</p><p> </p><p>The woman scoffed, shaking her head while she tried to look as annoyed as possible. But the three familiar words she spoke had a smile forced through them against her will. </p><p> </p><p>“Fuck off, Harkness” </p><p> </p><p>Rio had said the words, slamming the door shut without a second to spare. Through the window, she felt her heart grow warm when she heard Agatha belt out a warm laugh. A cackle that her little snort trickled through.</p><p> </p><p>She spun around, pulling her lips down to bite on while trying terribly to hide the wide grin that wanted to shine bright. Rio walked through the parking lot to her car, too busy in her head to notice how Agatha waited till she was safe in her own car. When she slithered in the drivers side, that’s when she heard the two beeps. Her eyes shot up, seeing Agatha’s hand flying in the air, but not with a normal wave. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh..that bitch” Rio chuckled. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had waved her middle finger in the air and Rio could vision so clearly that familiar antagonizing grin that went with it. She shook her head, buckling her seatbelt and started the engine up. </p><p><br />
Her plan originally was to go home, bury herself in bedsheets with a tub of ice cream. And out of nowhere, that had flipped like a coin. What was heads became tails and Rio knew which side she was fond of most, but would she say it to herself? No. That’d be ridiculous. </p><p>Instead, her eyes fell to her phone in the cup holder and like a threat?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Check her Instagram.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Rio asked out loud as if someone else said the words. </p><p> </p><p>Why would she look at Agatha’s Instagram? That made zero sense! There was no reason to, Rio did not care, Monday was just around the corner and they’d be back to usual. Neither would acknowledge this night ever happened. Agatha would undoubtedly give her a reason to remember why she hated her to begin with. </p><p> </p><p>“No..” Rio muttered to herself with a laugh. </p><p> </p><p>She clicked her seatbelt, pressed her foot on the brake before shifting the car into drive. However, she never moved to the gas pedal. Instead her body was frozen as if checking Agatha’s Instagram would unlock her, free her from the chains she had found herself in. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Gotta’ be kidding me.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio aggressively shifted back into park, snatching her phone up as if it was her opponent she was determined to defeat. </p><p> </p><p>A few seconds of stalking couldn’t hurt, right? Besides, it’s not like Agatha would know she ever looked. Rio made sure to first run a quick search off of Google, confirming Instagram wouldn’t tell Agatha she had checked her profile. </p><p> </p><p>She held in a deep breath while navigating through Jennifer’s followers, landing on Agatha’s account. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Motherhark.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Right, how could Rio forget that username? She had only looked once a few years ago, but didn’t bother to really pay attention. Agatha had requested to follow her and Rio denied it. That was that. </p><p> </p><p>And now here she was, clicking into her profile to see only the few posts that were up. Five, to be exact. That came as a shock to Rio, truthfully. She heard the few others including Agatha talking about reels and memes, god knows what else. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was never one to be on social media much. She much preferred being outside, working in her garden or taking her dog out on hikes through different nature trails. She had adopted a stray that wandered into her yard a year prior. A black pitbull lab Rio had named as Nicky. She wasn’t sure why, but simply went with the feeling in her heart it was the right name. </p><p><br />
Safe to say, social media was rarely on Rio’s radar. </p><p> </p><p>She pulled her lips back, clicking on the first post and just like that-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://ia601909.us.archive.org/5/items/received_1059515766067869/received_3962701300638705.png" alt="AgathaSelfie" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
</p><p> </p><p>Rio brought the back of her hand to her lips, pressing and biting down gently on her knuckles. This couldn’t be happening to her. A simple fucking selfie of Agatha and she felt as if her body was being set on fire. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes scanned the woman’s jaw line from left to right. Rio’s eyes had always wandered there, but how her head was tilted back made it more present. She fought of thinking about how it’d feel to trace her fingertips along the bone, suck, press down soft bites and kisses and-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I need to stop.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>But, she couldn’t stop. Not when her eyes trailed down her neck. The veins that popped out like a threat. The same thoughts rushed through her mind. She wondered how her skin would feel against her tongue, how Agatha looked with dark hickies as if Rio was some owner desperate to mark her property. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She isn’t yours to even mark. What the hell are you thinking? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The glasses were a rare sight. Agatha only wore them once in a while. Rio swore only Agatha knew how to make big frames work. Lilia tried, but everyone laughed and said she looked like an old kook with them. The older woman shunned them all for a week after that, but the glasses never made a return. </p><p> </p><p>And the worst of all? Her lips. Agatha Harkness’s fucking lips that moved with every annoying word she spoke. So vibrant, filled with life, almost begging for Rio to attack them with her own. And her eyes daring into Rio’s as if she was posting that photo solely for her. </p><p> </p><p>This was torture. Pure hell that Rio was putting herself through. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head, letting her thumb scroll to the next post that luckily eased the lust boiling within her. Instead, her teeth lifted off her knuckles as a tiny puff of air filled with humor pushed between her lips. </p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://archive.org/download/received_1059515766067869/received_1059515766067869.png" alt="Halloween" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
</p><p>Rio remembered the Halloween party vividly. Funny enough, it was Wanda who dragged her along as if she worked in the university herself. Rio had a plus one for the event, Wanda was adamant it was to be her. Which worked out because Rio’s co workers adored the red head and it took attention off of her. </p><p> </p><p>She remembered briefly seeing Agatha in the outfit. A rock star straight out of the seventies. Rio didn’t allow herself to linger long, slipping through the door, leaving an Irish goodbye to head home. She hated parties, but hated more how good Agatha looked in that outfit. </p><p> </p><p>But, Rio couldn’t hate the party. Not when Wanda had the time of her life or the bartender ended up giving her a few free shots. Lou Miller who Australian, tall with an attitude Rio instantly felt comfortable with. They even ended up exchanging numbers and Rio ended up becoming good friends with her. </p><p> </p><p>So no, Rio could not hate or dwell on that party. Especially seeing Lilia being in a photo. She always hated and avoided those. </p><p> </p><p>Rio continued on to the next photo and her heart swelled even larger. A tiny amused grin became warm. So soft she would nearly melt at the touch. </p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://archive.org/download/received_1160058468934243/received_1160058468934243.png" alt="BillyAgatha" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
</p><p>As much as Agatha gave that boy hell, acted as if he was an annoying nuisance- Everyone knew Agatha borderline adopted him like he was her own. If anything, William (Billy was becoming his name more these days or just Kaplan) seemed to be the light that shined in Agatha’s life. Not to say she was a miserable grump before he was hired, but she certainly became different in a good way when he did. </p><p>It wasn’t surprising she took time over the summer to help him become a better driver. Rio began to wonder what other adventures they went on and if the side she saw of Agatha tonight was a snippet into the soft natured person she could be. Through the rough exterior filled with sarcasm and insults, a wicked grin that threatened to annoy you till the end of time- </p><p>Rio felt as if she was wrong. Was Agatha more than just that? And was Rio really starting to crave figuring that out more? </p><p>No. She wasn’t, she couldn’t. And yet, she still scrolled.</p><p>
  <img src="https://ia801907.us.archive.org/29/items/covidpost/announcement.png" alt="AgathaAnnounce" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
</p><p>Right, the nice Agatha was announced and introduced to them all. Rio remembered that night very well. Not just because she didn’t want to be there, but it was when Agatha and her first met. What started off as intriguing and flirtatious became the start of a feud that would last years between them. </p><p><br />
She clenched her jaw, the smile fading as the reminder punched her in the gut. Agatha wasn’t going to continue to treat her like she did just before. It’d go back to the place they started. A feud between them, arguments and snarky comments. Rio would return to hating her even if she lusted after her as well. </p><p> </p><p>Shouldn’t Rio be happy this was a reminder for that? Rio should take a breath and become relaxed over it.</p><p> </p><p>So…why did she feel slightly disappointed?</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Whatever, one more post.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://archive.org/download/covidpost/covidpost.png" alt="AgathaCovid" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
</p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered, the smile returning as she softly laughed to herself. </p><p>“The fuck are you wearing, Harkness?” She muttered to herself. </p><p>She wore a baggy flannel, shorts and boots with a ridiculously large cowboy hat to top it off. Agatha looked utterly ridiculous and Rio tried to figure out why the hell she was dressed like that. </p><p>Maybe it was Covid brain that had gotten to her. Lockdown did drive everyone insane. Not Rio, she wished the lockdown lasted forever. Being paid to stay at home? Being told to stay away from people? How could Rio ever hate that? It was her dream life and she missed it terribly at times. </p><p>However, Agatha seemingly was losing her mind during it or…was this just Agatha? Was she silly this way? Did she love being the most confusing woman ever? </p><p>And better yet, why did Rio care so fucking much? </p><p><em> Just..go home. </em>She told herself. </p><p>Rio exited the app, locking her phone after making sure her Spotify kept playing music. Once she was situated, she put the car in drive, pressing on the gas to take off out of the parking lot. </p><p>It wouldn’t be until later on, possibly her next visit, it’d occur to her how the store in the rearview was tainted. Anytime she’d step inside, her mind would soar straight to Agatha singing a few steps away. She’d look at the ice cream pints, wait for the woman’s commentary on every flavor. Plus insult the ones Rio chose for herself. </p><p>Grocery shopping would never be the same.</p><p>Parking lots would suddenly feel too empty. </p><p>Being alone in the car would become quieter than before. </p><p> </p><p>Overall, Rio’s life would never be the same. It already wasn’t the moment her eyes locked with Agatha’s. She thought about the woman way more than she realized, but now? Oh. It was different. Everything had changed and Rio hadn’t entirely realized it. </p><p> </p><p>She turned the volume dial up for her music to play a bit louder. A song she had listened to every now and then, mostly when it came on shuffle in one of her mega playlists on Spotify came into clarity. Use Somebody, King of Leon. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You know that I could use somebody…someone like you” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio mumbled the lyrics to herself, barely registering the meaning or how it happened to be the first song that played off shuffle. If she did realize it, she’d be too busy denying and cursing the universe for trying to say Agatha was never meant to be her enemy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness was the woman Rio couldn’t stand. She hated her, despised and avoided her at all costs. </p><p> </p><p><em> You are not going to fall for the fucking enemy, Rio.. </em>She said to herself. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head as she mumbled to the song, trying to shake off the memory playing in her mind as she drove down the road. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Remember when we were kids? Like, when we wished for something every shooting star that passed?” Wanda asked.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda and her were laying in the backyard after a day of moving furniture and boxes nonstop. Rio had just moved into her new home. A tiny cottage tucked away from society. A bit of a farther drive from the university, but it was worth it.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio slowly exhaled the smoke, passing the joint over to Wanda who happily took it from her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Yeah. When you used to wish for longer hair” Rio snickered. </em>
</p><p><em><br />
</em> <em> Wanda chuckled.  </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “It worked!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “No, you just didn’t get it cut for three years” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “It still worked,” Wanda shrugged, taking in a small inhale. As she held it in her lungs, she swiftly added. “You wished for the same thing on repeat and never told me what it was, you know?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio scoffed.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Duh. Then it’d never come true” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda laughed as she choked on the smoke through her exhale.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Oh, come on! We were kids, is it still the same wish or something?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Ugh,” Rio groaned. “Kind of. Maybe. I don’t know” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Tell me” Wanda pushed, holding the joint in the air from her. “Or you aren’t getting this back” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio rolled her eyes, muttering under her breath how annoying the woman was. But she simply started to hum a tune as if she had all the time in the world to hate.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Fineeee,” Rio drew out the word in an annoyed tone. “Maybe I’ve wished…or used to- Yeah, used to. I dont’ waste time wishing anymore-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You so do” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Do not” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Do to” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Do you want to know or not?!” Rio asked.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda surrendered, gesturing for her to continue on as she took another hit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I guess..I don’t know, it’s stupid” Rio muttered, sitting up to run her hands through her hair. She held the strands back, tugging at her roots as she looked down. “I just..I love being alone, but-” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Don’t want to die alone?” Wanda asked.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio puffed out a bit of air with a tiny shrug.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Just feel like I make enemies all the time, you know?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda pushed up on her elbows, holding the joint in front of her to take. Like it was her reward for opening up on what her truest wish was.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Hey, who knows..” Wanda shrugged. “Maybe you’re meant to experience the enemies to lovers trope” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio was taking a hit when she broke out in a strong laugh.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “What?!” Wanda exclaimed. “It could be true!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Doubtful..” Rio said, turning her head over her shoulder with a low, “Those tropes are a headache. A disaster waiting to happen” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “And yet, sometimes the worst turns for the best,” Wanda said.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The redhead pushed herself up, their shoulders pressed together as she reached over to steal the joint back.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I wouldn’t rule it out,” She advised. “The world works in mysterious ways” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You and the universe bullshit..” Rio muttered. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> “Enemies to lovers, Rio. That’s your destiny. I can feel it in my bones” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio laughed.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “You’re stoned. All you’re feeling is an order of Five Guys or Taco Bell right now” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Ooo,” Wanda’s eyes lit up with a lazy grin filled with an appetite. “Both sound so good”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Of course they do..” Rio snickered.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She held tight on the steering wheel, remembering the <em> “enemies to lovers” </em>trope conversation as if it was right before sitting with Agatha. But, Rio still took in a strong breath while chanting in her mind how ridiculous that was. Agatha wasn’t the enemy she was meant to be with. Not when it’d be three years of pure torture having to endure her. </p><p> </p><p>As she drove, her mind started to drift back into the music. Focus on each song and ignore the lyrics' meanings. Everything would be fine. Monday would come along, they’d go back to ignoring and hating one another. This night would be a blip, a fever dream, something that never happened. </p><p> </p><p>But, what Rio wouldn’t figure out until the next day? Her thumb had slipped on one of Agatha’s posts. When she rushed to exit the app, she brushed over the heart icon and liked Agatha’s post all the way from Covid. Rio was so frantic and quick to drive off, desperate to ignore her interest in getting to know Agatha more. </p><p> </p><p>The first Instagram post Agatha had ever posted was from years ago and Rio fucking <em> liked </em>it. Agatha would get the notification, figure out Rio borderline stalked her right after they parted. Rio had signed her death certificate and hadn’t even known it yet. </p><p> </p><p>She would be too busy getting in the house, rushing to bed to see the notification that appeared on her screen that night. A habit of her’s was to clear her notifications, ignoring everything until the next day. Rio would be greeted with her death certificate in the morning. She’d open her phone to check all emails, messages, any notifications she might’ve missed. </p><p> </p><p>The notification would be the most life threatening, stomach dropping, heart racing one she’d ever lay eyes on.. </p><p> </p><p>

</p><hr /><p>
  <span>The sunrise slithered through the bedroom curtains, casting little golden streaks across the room. Rio’s eyes slowly flickered open to the light. Matched with Nicky sniffing her up and down, pawing at her leg with the unspoken request, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’d like to go outside, Mother” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She slowly turned over, ruffling the hair on his head with a lazy smile. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Morning, bud. How’d you slee-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A yawn cut her greeting off, stretching her limbs and felt the bed shift as he launched off of it. His paws skidded down the hall, racing for the back door before she could finish her question. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pushed herself out of bed, always thankful for the boy who entered her life. He was the reason she was able to move on her worst days. Even through her darkest moments, his energy and life radiated through her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She rubbed her eye while stepping down the hall, into the small kitchen to find him tapping at the glass screen as if Rio had kept him hostage for days. She scoffed with a little laugh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jesus, dude. Ever heard of Stockholm Syndrome? Why not fall in love with your captor instead?” She joked, unlocking and pushing the door open for him to fly out of. “Run along now” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With fire under his paws, he rushed out and ran into the yard. Rio had gotten a fence around her backyard the second he came into her life. It was a game changer to say the least. She was able to leave the door open for whenever he wanted to come back in, letting her drift off to start her day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That was the thing about Rio, a curse she joked was set upon her. No matter the hour, if her eyes opened and body moved- She became restless. It’d be three in the morning and she’d end up packing her lunch for the day, taking a shower and getting dressed. Slumber never came easy to her. She wondered at times what it was like to have a full night’s rest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio clicked the coffee maker on as she walked by, heading into the bathroom for her morning routine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The night before felt like a fever dream as it slowly trickled back to her. The memory of Agatha was fuzzy, how she found her in the ice cream aisle crying her eyes out. Then invited her to sit and eat their feelings together. It all felt surreal, foreign, as if she made it all up to cope with the idea of hating her. </span>

    <span>How the fuck would that make sense?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Rio muttered in her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>What didn’t make sense to her either? Possibly more than just that? Agatha being stood up as well. Rio couldn’t wrap her head around the idea of that happening. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Not a chance. </span>
  </em>
  <span>That had to have been a lie because- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Who would give up a chance to be with someone that hot?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With the toothbrush in her mouth brushing off her back molars- Rio froze. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t think that. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio told herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio brushed her teeth harder to the point her gums subtly felt a pinch of pain. She was desperate to shake that thought away because, </span>
  <em>
    <span>no! </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio hated Agatha. A simple two hour hang out session wouldn’t change that!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Sure, yes, okay- Agatha was hot. That thought had always been there no matter how much Rio hated it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, the more the memories of the night before came into clarity..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh my god. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio spit out the toothpaste, rinsing her brush off while tipping back the water to swish. Her cheeks stretched just as wide as her lungs, mind racing as her heart sunk to the floor beneath her feet as she realized,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s hot. Like. Hot, hot. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s grin she gave before they parted ways burned in her mind. She felt the same energy seethe through her veins. How her lips looked so delicate, soft, warm to the touch. Her eyes were lazy with tiredness from the day and night’s events. Even through her exhaustion, she smiled at Rio like the woman was the sun peaking out of a cloudy day. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t know what to do. Should she put in her resignation? That’d be a good start. Maybe she’d spend the morning apartment searching and give her place up to someone else. Honestly, she didn’t care if her savings would be drained by the end of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Escaping Agatha Harkness was the only answer possible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span>Truthfully, Rio knew she’d never grow close to doing such a thing. The woman adored her job, students, the people she worked with (Minus a certain </span>
  <em>
    <span>someone). </span>
  </em>
  <span>She loved her home, the town she lived in, how her two closest friends lived five minutes away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So, as peaceful as an escape sounded- Rio wouldn’t dare make that move. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Besides, she wasn’t going to let Agatha win. If either of them were the one to jump ship, skip town- It should be her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I was here first..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio checked to make sure her coffee mug was being filled. Sometimes it took a few smacks against the machine to get it working. One day, she’d buy a new one. She just never had a reason to do so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t that she was cheap. Rio had made a decent living and savings for herself over the years. More so the reason stemmed from her special talent. Wanda had nicknamed her years ago,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Particular Procrastinator” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio remembered hearing Natasha break down laughing, agreeing with her partner up and down. She looked over confused, asking for an explanation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You procrastinate only on certain things in particular” Wanda shrugged. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Everything besides work, more like” Natasha added. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio scoffed. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Bullshi-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You literally kept your mattress till your back was so sore you barely were able to stand up!” Wanda laughed. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Your laptop had a crack in the screen for years,” Natasha added. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Oh! Don’t forget her microwave barely cooked anything! Took ages to heat up a soft pretzel”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“And when she-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Okay!” Rio yelled. “Point taken. Loud and clear, but..” She shrugged. “At least all my work is done before an hour till the deadline” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Natasha and Wanda both booed, sticking their tongue out while the other flipped her off. Rio snickered, sinking back in the couch with victory- Even if she was a procrastinator. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The steaming liquid poured into her coffee after she smacked it on the side a few times. Rio smiled to herself with a small,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“See? You’re still working” She mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Glancing outside to check on Nicky who was rolling around in the grass, Rio smiled softly. The warm sunny patch that Rio imagined felt good on his back would leave a mess all over his fur, but she didn’t mind. She always chose his happiness over frustrating messes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She then moved to find her phone on the counter, plugged into its charger. Rio scoffed, thinking how it was impressive she even remembered to charge it. Late nights or not, it was a bad habit to let her phone die twenty four seven. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio expected texts from Wanda and Natasha in their group chat, pestering her on the date and asking how it went. She already dreaded having to admit to being stood up, but hey- It’d get her an excuse to not let them make dating profiles or set her up on blind dates in the near future. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When the screen lit up, a few notifications were listed off. Random reels being sent to her, email articles that she didn’t care for, and as she expected- The group chat eagerly awaiting her updates. She didn’t have it in her to talk, not yet. Later in the day that’d be a hill she had to climb over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span>The coffee maker beeped, signalling her cup was ready for her. She whistled a soft tune, sitting her phone down to stroll over. A tiny bit of milk, a small bit of sugar, she brought the burning liquid to her lips. Typically, she waited for it to cool off, but…after last night’s events? The day ahead? She didn’t care how it’d burn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She hissed, squeezing her eyes shut as the seering sting ran over her tongue and down her throat. Rio shook her head, collecting herself before picking her phone back up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Emails would be the first app to open, making sure she didn’t miss anything important. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Next, Facebook to check her memories. Lilia loved tagging her in things, but today was empty. Another sigh of relief she wouldn’t have to be social more than her two friends. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead of ignoring the reels on Instagram, Rio decided to check them out. That’d settle Wanda’s harassing just a tiny bit. Enough to save her mentality and well being somewha-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Holy fuck. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio clicked the notifications when she saw the little icon that signalled someone requested to follow her. It’d be a bot or someone from high school who would be way too eager to reconnect. But no, her worst nightmare sat in the waiting room to be accepted. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span>As if the words were in all capitals, bold, daring, life threatening and ready to kill Rio on the spot-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>
    <em>“Motherhark has requested to follow you”</em>
  </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio dropped her phone on the counter. Somehow remembering to gently place her mug down instead of letting it crash all over the floor. Her feet took two steps back, her palm pressed tight against her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What the fuck?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How did she-</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>There’s no way she knows I looked. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>SHE CAN NOT KNOW I LOOKED, RIGHT?!</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt sick to her stomach. The tiny sip of the bitter liquid swirling, ready to shoot back up as if it’d been rejected. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This couldn’t be real, no. Rio must’ve had to be still dreaming. That was the only explanation for this! She Googled it, made sure Agatha would have no idea she checked and stalked her profile like some creep.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wait..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A thought popped into her mind, the only answer that settled her fear- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She thought about my Instagram..</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yes..yes! That’s it! </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She wanted to stalk me just as I did with her- No. Nothing weird about us having the same thought. No. Nope. She’s the creep, not me. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio reached back out to pick her phone up, thumb hesitating over the reject button. Though as if she had a magnet under her skin, her phone was a fridge or a locker- She felt the screen press against her thumb and just like that-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha Harkness had followed and gained access to Rio Vidal’s Instagram.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This is fine. Everything is fine. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No one would notice or say anything. Agatha would most likely be a nuisance and send her even more reels than Wanda did. That was that. She didn’t even have to follow her back. The interaction could be a one way street- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You had to accept the follow though…so, is it still only one sided or-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No..” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span>She started to laugh, putting the phone down to pace across the kitchen tiles, sipping from the burning liquid that suddenly felt numb. Rio felt her thoughts screaming in circles around her. As if they were a bunch of little demons having a world war of their own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first side was trapped in a deep state of disbelief, screaming out the words,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This can’t be real. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What the hell did I just do? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Is..this is all a nightmare..it has to be, oh my g-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The other side was hard at work, rationalizing and trying to alleviate the situation. Rio was </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No! No, it’s fine.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She followed me. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She invited me to hang out. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This is all Agatha, not me. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In the back of her mind was a soundtrack. A lingering tune that was an orchestra, enhancing and egging on the dramatic battle between her thoughts. She’d barely been awake for twenty minutes and the day felt long, never ending. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Block her.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fix this before it’s too-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio had rushed back to her phone, hands shaking as she swiped the screen open. Her thumb tapped onto Agatha’s profile only to have the notification pop up above.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Late..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/FuckinOne.jpeg" alt="AgathaText1” width=" height="600" align="middle" />
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Is this how being murdered feels? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Jesus, don’t be that dramatic. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck my life..” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Whatever. This didn’t matter. Agatha texting her didn’t have to mean anything and furthermore, Rio was not required to offer a reply. Agatha wasn’t entitled to her attention. She was lucky enough Rio had (For whatever reason) accepted the follow request. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why did she follow me?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The question started to itch her brain, scratching as it begged to dig up the answer. The delusional side of her wanted to believe Agatha simply craved being annoying. Maybe she got the wrong idea after the night before. It was all pure hope to save herself from the possible, biggest, complete and total embarrassing move she’d ever pull. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Like what you see..”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Those words slowly demolished her hope brick by brick, piece after piece. The deep tug in the pit of her stomach pulled tighter. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I made sure to not like anything..didn’t I?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Reviewing each post again felt dooming, but at the same time inevitable. Her fingers trembled as she tapped the screen, bringing her back to the familiar profile. No new posts, the same sight as the night before remained. She held her breath, clicking the selfie that choked her the first time and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The reaction remained the same. A chilling sense of desire, her taste buds tingling with the need to feel Agatha’s skin- Taste her lips and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no, no. Stop it” Rio muttered to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her thumb aggressively swiped, flying down the posts until she saw the red heart bright as can be. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Like what you see..”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The four words echoed into the void of her soul. She felt her pulse beating through her, a screeching ring in her ears and Rio swore she could hear the blood flowing through her veins come to a stop. The birds outside, trees swaying in the breeze, all of it was silenced. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Who knew a red heart could feel so life threatening?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio Vidal had liked one of Agatha Harkness’s Instagram posts. Not a post from a year ago. Not two, not three, not four, but- </span>
  <em>
    <span>FIVE YEARS</span>
  </em>
  <span> ago. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘March 27th 2020’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>to be exact. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The Covid post where Agatha stood in a cowboy hat and boots. When Rio had smiled to herself with a shake of her head, wondering what on earth she was wearing. She liked it. Her thumb either slipped or she was drunk on exhaustion to register the action. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh..my..god” She muttered to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had to fix this. Even if it meant talking to the woman who was bound to give her hell till the end of time. Rio figured Agatha would berate her to the grave over liking her first ever Instagram post. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The first one. Fucking first..COULD’VE LIKED THE RECENT ONE AT LEAST!</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio screamed at herself silently, racing to open the chat she originally planned on ignoring. It wasn’t a surprise either Agatha hadn’t taken a millisecond to reply.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/FuckTwo.jpeg" alt="AgathaText2" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
</p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>At least one thing from this was worth it. Rio was remembering exactly why she couldn’t stand Agatha Harkness. Even if she seemed kind, gentle, warm and sympathetic- She was ready to use Rio’s most (Well, now second compared to the Instagram shit) embarrassing moment of her life against her.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And yet? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh no. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She gripped her phone, staring wide at the messages while a new thought joined the party in her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I can not actually like her teasing me..</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>There’s no fucking way. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No, I-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Another message from Agatha popped up, bringing her back from the edge of panic. The cliff edge Rio was preparing to jump off of left abandoned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Argue her. Be mean. Show her you don’t care. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded to herself, letting her thumbs work their magic. Well, she hoped that would be the case. </span>
</p><p>
  <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/FuckThree.jpeg" alt="AgathaText3" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had to block her. That was the only way to end this nightmare Rio was convinced she’d have to wake up from at some point. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, Rio continued to sip from her coffee, staring at Agatha’s profile dumbfounded by the new found thoughts in her mind. How part of her fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>liked </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha teasing her. She couldn’t resist staring at the latest post. That stupid selfie that made Rio crave and envision horrible, disgusting, perverted things. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why are you letting this happen?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio had zoned out to the point she didn’t notice how much time had passed until Agatha messaged her again, snapping the woman out of the daze she had fallen into. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/FourFuck.jpeg" alt="AgathaText4" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh my godddd!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She groaned, tilting her head back as she squeezed her eyes shut. Just when she thought the situation couldn’t possibly get worse, it does. Even more so how Agatha was waiting on the other side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio wondered if she was still in bed, leaning on her kitchen counter just as she was, on the couch or-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Stop thinking about what she’s doing while texting you, creep. </span>
  </em>
  <span>She told herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio muttered some curse words of annoyance under her breath. Once again, she decided replying was her only option. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It is my only option. Not because I want to talk to her more…or anything. </span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(Anddd, that was a lie!)</span>

</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Good. Don’t give her another answer. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled to herself, relief and pride hitting her when Agatha didn’t reply within a few seconds. Though, it was short lived and Rio should have been prepared for that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The notification appeared on her screen with words that didn’t just annoy her, but also made her heart skip a few beats. She felt the way her breathing staggered because of it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>

  <em>
    <span>Oh, fuck this bitch. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, why should Rio feel any amount or speck of surprise Agatha was using </span>
  <em>
    <span>blackmail </span>
  </em>
  <span>to her advantage?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Bet she’s included in the definition of that word. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ignore her, don’t give her the satisfaction of it. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As if Agatha was hearing her thoughts from afar, reading her mind like a book- The next text popped up just before Rio was able to exit the chat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/04/28/EightFuck.jpeg" alt="AgathaText8" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />

  <em>
    <span>We’d be a delicious combo- Oh no. No. No. NOOOO!</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, eyes shut tight. She smacked her thigh a few times as if it was her coffee maker, shaking it to drain all the liquid out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From a nightmare to a night terror, Rio was convinced she was trapped in one. Or, maybe she died and this was hell. Whatever her new reality was, it felt damning. Alarms were blaring in her mind, she swore she could see the red lights spinning for her to evacuate. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I can not fall for her. I can’t.</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This is lust. Nothing more than just lust. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She opened her eyes, rereading the few messages back and forth. A bell rang in her ears. One that belonged to a high striker in an amusement park. Her realization was the sledgehammer, pounding downwards and hitting the thought above. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I have to confirm this is nothing. </span>

  <em>
    <span>What? You can not possibly be debating hanging out with her again! </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It’s the only way!</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No, no. There’s other options and-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I have to know this is just…nothing. No crush. No deeper feelings. Just. Fucking. Lust. </span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You can’t!</span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She locked her phone, placing it back on the counter while her eyes flickered up to the imaginary camera in front of her. She felt like Jim from The Office, giving his well known deadpan stare that said,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You’ve got to be kidding me.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio ran both her hands over her face, palms digging into her skin while fingers traced through the bed tangled hair. She slowly felt the weight of seeing Agatha on her again. Hating her was becoming more difficult by the second. How the fuck was this going to make that any easier?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The argument in her head had settled down, sizzling to a simple question Rio would be asking herself all day and night,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What is wrong with me?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sat in the parking lot, trapped in her car she hoped wouldn’t open. Maybe she’d get lucky somehow and all four doors would be sealed shut. She’d simply shrug, mouth an </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Oh well’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>before zooming off into oblivion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her escape thought was hopeless for the first ten minutes, but she felt hopes lift up as every second went by- It’d be possible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They ended up agreeing on a time for six PM. Rio being the punctual person she was- She had been ten minutes early to be on time. Agatha on the other hand unsurprisingly was now ten minutes late. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Two opposite ends of the clock, Rio could only hope that was another reason to hate her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took a sigh, head tilted back while her eyes stared through the car's sunroof. The sky was cloudy, a grey doom that matched the energy this hang out was sure to be. The night before was two souls longing for emotional support. They had stumbled into one another and that was that. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With the aftermath of being stood up fading away piece by piece, Rio told herself this would be different. They’d argue, banter, possibly even hit one another with baseball bats instead of the objects designated for such actions.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Or, maybe they’d never get the chance to do so since Agatha still hadn’t shown up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Come on, Harkness..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wait..what? </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio flipped her head down, eyes wide as she stared out the windshield. Had she truly wished in some form for Agatha to show up?  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Only because I want to confirm this is nothing. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yeah…that’s it. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(No. It wasn’t)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t have a chance to dwell on the thought much longer. Her eyes drifted over to the familiar vehicle parking in the row ahead of her. Just a few spots away to her left. Rio sighed of relief and despair, undoing her seatbelt in hopes the car doors would magically be glued shut. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, the door opened right up. A gate swinging wide, almost flying off the hinges with excitement for her to step on through. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shut the door with a bit of flair behind her. A flick of her wrist that said, </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck you </span>
  </em>
  <span>to the car for working. She shook her head, muttering a few curse words incoherently while pressing the lock button. After making sure she had her wallet and phone, Rio spun around and-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck me..” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Not that way (Yes that way).</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stepped out of her car with a chocolate donut held in her mouth</span>
  <em>
    <span>. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Suddenly I want to be a don- Don’t even finish that thought, idiot.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The denim black jacket draped over a familiar blue flannel she’d wear on Friday’s. Her hair was pulled back, barely held by the loose hair tie. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked so…</span>
  <em>
    <span>normal? </span>
  </em>
  <span>No. That wasn’t the word, but Rio was too dumbfounded to think of the correct one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha Harkness was always polished. Her personality and teaching methods were not, but the outfits and signature design screamed a different side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From the pantsuits, trousers and button ups that always had a few undone. Even with the familiar flannel, Agatha was able to make it fancy. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even if she looked more laidback than usual, Rio still felt her outfit wasn’t enough. The blue sweater that almost slipped off her left shoulder. Only part of her hair pulled back, still messy from her slumber. She wore her black jeans and a knock off brand to the Converse high tops, a memory hitting her as she glanced down at the pair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m not a cheapskate, Wanda. I just don’t give a fuck when I can get the same ones for fifteen dollars” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“God. You’re so boring” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The memory of their interaction from a few weeks ago made her stomach flip. Would Agatha care about them? Was she someone who admired name brands over knock offs from Walmart?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck it. If she cares, I can hate her more. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cleared her throat, striding through the parking lot to meet her. Agatha was busy chewing away, rummaging through what Rio assumed was her purse. She leaned in the passenger seat where Rio had sat hours prior. </span>
</p><p>
  <span><br />
</span>
  <span>Was Agatha thinking about that?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Did she already fill the vacancy as if Rio never existed?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And why the fuck did Rio care to know?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman leaned back up, slamming the door shut while glancing to her left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stood with her arms crossed, holding them tight against her as if she could restrain the complicated feelings and never let them escape. But as Agatha’s smile grew wide, those blue eyes somehow shining with no sun in sight- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh. Why did I agree to this?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“‘Ere she is!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman’s words were muffled with the remaining crumbs of the donut in her mouth. Rio should cringe, find it repulsive, but instead-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ha. Cute- No. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Took ‘ou long ‘nough” Agatha added.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, not bothering to point out how Agatha was late. She had a feeling that would be useless to dwell on. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, I don’t speak </span>
  <em>
    <span>donut</span>
  </em>
  <span>?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead of chuckling over the tiny joke or returning a humorous one of her own. Agatha’s jittery movements froze. Even her chewing came to a stop for a few seconds before they continued. Slow chomp after chomp, what looked like a rough swallow to finish it off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She slowly smirked, arms folded against her own chest to mirror Rio’s stance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her voice was pitched in a teasing tone. Rio felt her heart skip a beat, anticipating words that were sure to damn her into a state of embarrassment.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The remainder of that donut was in my mouth before you got over here” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pointed out. It didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out where Agatha was going with this. Rio dug her nails into her palms, lips pulled back while she waited for the final bullet to hit her chest.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Were you watching me, </span>
  <em>
    <span>my little stalker?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Shit. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fix this. Fix this. FIX IT!</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shifted on her feet from one side to the other. A weak scoff while her eyes rolled to avoid the narrowing eyes on her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“In your dreams” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a second before she snickered. Eyes of her own rolled back and Rio cursed herself for watching. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Her every move is getting to me. God. I need to get laid so this stops. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(Rio could sleep with every woman on the planet and Agatha would still make her crumble. Of course, she wouldn’t admit to that)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well then,” Agatha held her hand up to the building, tossing her back an annoying grin. “Shall we?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess,” Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took the lead for them both, giving Rio access to watch her from behind all over again. How her hips swayed as if she knew to give the woman a show. Her head held up, confidence and power radiating for miles around her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio hated it. She hated her. And she hated even more how Agatha opened the door, stepped aside with her arm swaying inward, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“After you, professor” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She rolled her eyes, muttering a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha brushed her shoulder against Rio’s while walking ahead again. Rio wondered if it was on purpose, but forced her attention elsewhere. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The room was empty besides them and the worker at the counter. She scanned the posters of people destroying things with malicious grins. The sounds of music from down the hall with bottles of glass breaking echoed, but were covered up by Agatha’s voice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, just the two uh..” She said, looking back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead of asking her, Agatha let her eyes roam Rio from head to toe. Almost as if the move was intentional, looking to make the woman shiver under her stare. Rio swore too it burned red lasers and left marks beneath her clothes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d say large”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Did she just pick my size for me? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span><br />
</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>And why is that kind of…hot?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The worker nodded, disappearing into the back room to grab what Rio assumed was the jumpsuits of protection people were wearing in the photos. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Think I’m fat?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tall,” She said, leaning an elbow on the counter with her palm propping her chin up. “I learned the hard way their suits run short” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not that tall. You’re like what? An inch shorter than me?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“When I’m not wearing heels that make you look tiny, mhm” She hummed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Rio was able to visualize the memory of her heels that threatened to shatter the university floors, the worker popped back up with neon green jumpsuits in his hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright,” He smiled. “Gloves and jumpsuits here. You guys are in room seven. Right down the hall you’ll see our helmet selection and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smacked the counter twice with a wink. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thanks kid,” She said. “I’ve got it from here” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He stammered a few times before giving up and sitting back down. Agatha whistled as she handed Rio her gear, leading them to the hallway of different rooms. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, but not over the ugly color of the gear in her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You didn’t have to cut the poor guy off” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Maybe she did. That helps me hate her. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m excited,” She shrugged, smirking over her shoulder with a raspy, “Punish me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Nevermind. She should not have done that. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The number seven was spray painted on the door like a jail cell. Rio wasn’t sure if she was a fan of how it looked either. The door was heavy, slid open and shut like they were two inmates stepping into their doom. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I swear. If we get stuck, I’m killing myself…and her. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio followed Agatha by pulling on the jumpsuit over her clothes. It was pretty simple, but the zipper on the back decided to put up a fight. Her eyes flickered over to Agatha who was grabbing their helmets, seeing she had managed to secure the back with ease.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How experienced is she with this shit?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She grumbled a few insults at the zipper under her breath, wrists growing sore from trying to pull it up. Though what made her wish the pain would’ve stayed at the forefront? The familiar electric shock trembled through her body. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your shades of green are nicer, that’s for sure”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha spoke so casually as she pushed Rio’s fingers away. As if this was their normal and she helped Rio get dressed a million times before. Rio heard the zipper fly up with ease, Agatha stepping back as swiftly as she appeared. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Jesus. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio raised an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What uh…what do you mean?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She managed to break through the aftermath of her shock to ask. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha picked up the gloves, pulling on the left before her right. That smirk Rio swore hadn’t left at all stayed present. She then shrugged as if her words were obvious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your wardrobe is ninety-nine percent dark green” Agatha pointed out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh” Rio replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh? That’s it?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha grabbed the motorcycle helmet, flipping it upside down to hold the straps on each side. Her smirk finally faded away and Rio felt as if she could take a breath. That was until she realized what it had been swapped for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt smacked by the memory of the night before, remembering every piece of it well,</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha smiled, head tilted back against the seat and oh hell- Rio swore the look made her feel tipsy as if she downed a bottle of jack. The woman looked so content. A lazy smile that Rio never had access to before. She was used to vicious smirks, exaggerated grins everytime she managed to make Rio storm off. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Not whatever this was, but…what Rio knew? She loved and hated it more than words can say. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not a bad thing” Agatha assured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That smile is worse than any other look she owns. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio swore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman forced her attention to the gloves followed by the helmet, determined to focus into rage over whatever the hell Agatha gave her. Butterflies? Flustered? Disgust?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yep. The third one. Has to be. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And as if the universe had it out for her. Almost as if it was desperate and fed off of her embarrassment more and more, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fucks sake..why is this shit so stupid?!” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The helmet knocked around her head as she struggled with the buckle. Agatha had made it look so easy just like the zipper on her back. Rio actually felt hope it’d be simple, but no…why would it be?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled, stepping over as her fingers recharged the voltages within Rio’s veins.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Here, let me do it..” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s brain was now full of glitches, lungs stripped of oxygen, every limb in her body went numb or didn’t exist anymore- Rio didn’t know which. In that moment, it was Agatha. She was in her orbit, close enough to wrap arms around or push away. Rio truly preferred the second (She didn’t). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked through her cloudy shield, the glass clearly hadn’t been cleaned in ages. Rio didn’t even want to think if the rest of the helmet was ever washed. If she walked out of here with lice though? That’d be a perfect reason to resent Agatha Harkness for eternity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well? Ready to rage, professor?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>God, you have no idea..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t say anything. Instead, she stormed past her to (Almost) break the door down. She heard Agatha’s little snort behind her, but luckily it was drowned by the blaring music through the speakers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The tail ending of Dragula by Rob Zombie bounced off the walls. Rio felt her anxiety ease for a moment. She grew up with her father blasting those songs through the car speakers. Her small body flew in the air with each bump and turn, hair flying as she giggled with every word they screamed together. It was a beautiful memory, one that warmed her heart. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She never thought that memory, song, feeling would ever be increased. That was until her head turned over her shoulder, seeing Agatha rocking out with her head banging back and forth. She picked up the baseball bats, lips moving as she chanted the chorus, holding out the one for Rio to take. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And suddenly, Rio hated how Rob Zombie just got ten times better. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The song ended just as Rio took the bat, silence filled the void for three seconds before the brutal guitar of </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Limp Bizkit - Break Stuff</span>
  </em>
  <span>’ welcomed them to the room with spray paint covering the wall, glass bottles and wooden boxes. A few old style television boxes with half broken laptops on desks. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha flipped her bat in the air with a flourish, lifting it to her right before bringing it down to crash into the television screen. A scream followed along, glass shards decorated in the air and scattered across the floor. Rio leaned to the side with her arm in the air, shielding herself from the sudden explosion. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wanted to hate this. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio wanted to feel more annoyed by the second. But as her eyes opened back up to see Agatha smiling like a fool, her laughter contagious over the music as she started to scream the lyrics like it’d be her last words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s..oh my-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C'mon Green Witch!” Agatha yelled over the music, flashing her wide grin over. She gestured with her bat to the laptop on the desk. “Hit that shit like it's all you wanna’ do!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked over then back at Agatha with a small grin of her own. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So like it's you?!” Rio yelled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If that's what you're into” She winked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Of course…walked myself into that one.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took a step forward to the desk, clearly hesitant to smash the device into pieces. Agatha must’ve sensed it or maybe Rio wore it, but she walked over to stand across from her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s been pissing you off?” She yelled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked up, not struggling to reply, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed. Rio wondered if she realized she was being serious or not. Regardless, Agatha nodded and pushed the laptop across the desk. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then think of me, honey!”  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>It’s been hard not to..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stepped back with her arms folded, leaning against the wall with her smirk never failing to disappear. Rio took in a deep breath, looking back at the laptop while Agatha was on her mind. If you told her a few days ago to stand in a rage room, think of Agatha while smashing devices into pieces- She’d be happy to!</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio would think about the cactus she gifted. How she changed the rules overnight to switch classrooms closer to her own. She’d think of their first meeting when her hopes were lifted only to be crushed by Agatha’s insulting demeanor. Every little thing Rio would think of didn't match to what the thoughts were now.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All she could think about now was the polar opposite. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She thought about Agatha’s smirk no longer pissing her off. It made her stomach flip, cheeks darken a shade of red while she ignored the most embarrassing feature- How her cunt burned and threatened to soak through her boxers (She still wasn’t admitting to that and never would). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The way Agatha now made her laugh, the lazy smile that killed her the night before and just in the parking lot. Those insults she once hated, now she was growing adoration for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She hated everything. How Agatha was growing on her like moss as if she was a tree unable to stop or resist what was happening to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took in a deep breath, listening to the lyrics through the speakers pierce her ears, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You better watch your back because I’m fucking up your program” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And god, how real those lyrics were. Agatha was fucking up everything between them and in Rio’s life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I hate her. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>With a loud yell, the bat lifted in the air and came crashing down. She smashed the laptop nearly in half, flattening the middle between both sides. Agatha’s laughter followed the destruction, clapping her hands as she yelled, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s what I’m talking about! Glad I can be of service!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I hate you!” She yelled back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha only grinned wider, lifting her bat in the air like it was one of those Star Wars swords (Whatever they were called, Rio had no idea). Rio slowly smiled like the devil herself, wondering how she knew they’d end up fighting this way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She lifted her own to mirror Agatha’s stance. Both staring each other down before yelling a loud,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“HA!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>In sync as they smashed the bats together. They started to circle the desk, laughing as they kept trying to poke the other with the end, but either side held their own defense well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“YOU’RE SO ANNOYING!” Rio screamed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“OH, SHUT UP! WE ALL KNOW YOU LOVE IT!” Agatha laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“YOU WISH!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I KNOW YOU WISH I ANNOYED YOU MORE!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“YOU COULDN’T POSSIBLY DO SUCH A THING WHEN YOU HOLD THE WORLD RECORD FOR BEING INSUFFERABLE!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“AWE! THAT’S SO KIND OF YOU TO SAY, HONEY!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha dodged to her left as Rio rounded to her side of the desk. The movement took Rio by surprise. Somehow she lost her balance lunging forward, her feet tripping as she stumbled into the wall. Her helmet smacked against it first, shoulder crashed while her knees gave out beneath her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit, Rio!” Agatha called out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No humor was in the woman’s tone. Just panic and worry as she ran over. The bat was tossed aside, her knees cracked so hard Rio somewhat heard it over the music. If her mind wasn’t so overwhelmed with the sudden fall, she would’ve made an old person joke about Agatha’s knees (Even if she was the older one herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked her eyes a few times, adjusting back to the light and Agatha beside her. Her hands were roaming down her arms and legs, checking for any glass that may have pierced the jumpsuit. The woman looked terrified out of her mind and for some reason? Rio knew it wasn’t about herself. She wasn’t worried about feeling guilty for moving aside and allowing Rio to fall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s worried about me..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Just as Rio came back to clarity, the adrenaline of the initial crash came down- She registered the song above. Her lips curled up into a tiny laugh. She hadn’t heard the song in ages, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>- Was it a damn thing of irony as she stared at Agatha beside her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>‘Miley Cyrus - 7 Things’</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her little cousin had the biggest obsession for the singer. Rio used to drive her everywhere and found a love for the songs as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nice swing you had there” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha spoke before Rio was really able to think about the lyrics. Part of her was thankful for not only that, but Agatha’s look of fear settling down. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, starting to push herself up. Agatha didn’t hesitate to grab her arms, guiding her up to be steady on her feet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Come on!” She said over the music. “Let’s get out of here before you hurt yourself again” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bullshit! We just got here!” Rio argued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was taking a step to the door when she turned. No smile, no joking demeanor. She wore seriousness laced with confusion and surprise.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You still want to..after that?!” She yelled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Only fuels my ambition to break more shit with you on my mind, Harkness!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded, that shit eating grin wider than before as she moved to pick their baseball bats back up. She passed the one back to Rio, winking with the words, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Game on, professor!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Game on. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <span>About an hour later, they stumble out of the room with laughter dying down between them. Their ears were ringing from the music and every piece of destruction they caused. The muffled silence was a beautiful thing for Rio. She hated when overwhelming noises went on for too long. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took her helmet off with ease, but laughed when she saw Rio fumbling with her’s all over again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C’mere, helmet head” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha curled her finger and as if it was a spell being casted, Rio’s hands dropped as her feet dragged across the floor to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman tilted her head back, shivering as Agatha’s fingers grazed the skin beneath her chin, making RIo wonder how it’d feel for her fingers to wrap around her throat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh my god, stop being a perv-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The helmet lifted off her head, hanging loosely on Agatha’s fingers. Agatha’s next movement caught Rio off guard harder than her fall had. It was worse than being found sobbing in the ice cream aisle or even the embarrassment of being stood up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s left hand lifted up, fingers tracing down her jawline as her eyes trailed along with them. Rio held her breath, eyes wide as she felt fear hold her hostage. She was a statue beneath Agatha’s touch. Like the woman before her was medusa. Instead of her eyes, it was her fingers able to turn one into stone.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio wondered if Agatha could hear her heart pounding. Did she think a thunderstorm was raging through her? Rio wouldn’t be shocked if she was. She felt her blood run cold, not from hatred- just fear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was terrified of how close they were. Petrified of Agatha's touch, a simple gaze, how her breath was so close she could feel the chill from it against her lips. Every little thing was overwhelming her and suddenly- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I have to resign before Monday..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s still worried about the fall I took. That’s it. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>There is nothing else about this. Get out of your head, idiot. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was wearing a helmet” Rio managed to say, but her voice wasn't as rough as she wanted. “I’m fine” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>ANDDDDD, THAT WAS A LIE!</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes shot away. She looked at RIo like a child who had been caught in the candy jar when she shouldn’t have been. The woman visibly swallowed, forcing a little smile.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah..right”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her voice was weak, vacant of any humor or the usual tease lined up behind it and Rio started to think words that shouldn’t exist. Not when it was Agatha related.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wait..was she not thinking about- She must’ve been. She couldn’t be thinking about kiss-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well,” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed as she pulled away and </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Rio missed it instantly. She felt cold without her touch, watching the woman walk across the hall to hang up the helmet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This was all only because she’s touch deprived, that’s it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Nothing about Agatha </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(</span>
  <em>
    <span>Everything</span>

  <span> about Agatha)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Turn around, let me get the zipper before you get in a fight with that too” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wait, what? </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio spun on her heel, hating how Agatha was most definitely a fucking witch. Why did she just cave into her demand? It had to be a spell. A curse Rio would follow every word she said from now on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The zipper was pulled down, Agatha’s fingers pushing the texture off Rio’s shoulders. She rushed to take over from there, not letting her go any further before she exploded out of emotion and desire in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They both moved in silence after the two close interactions…well, maybe three if you count the fall Rio took as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Agatha sighed. “That felt good, didn’t it?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio glared. Agatha snickered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The worker had disappeared from the counter, both silently thankful to leave their gear and head out to the parking lot. Rio this time took the lead to push the door open, holding it for Agatha to walk out from behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, maybe the fall wasn’t great. But, </span>
  <em>
    <span>mentally </span>
  </em>
  <span>it felt good, no?” She asked, quickly adding, “After being stood up, it was some nice therapy”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio almost questioned what she meant, completely forgetting the Tinder date she was supposed to go on. Her entire weekend had been taken up by Agatha. The woman lived in Agatha’s mind more than ever before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This is terrifying..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I guess I’ll…give you that” She shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The closer they got to Agatha’s car, Rio’s initial plan grew closer. She wanted to leave the second she could. Give Agatha a cold shoulder, Irish goodbye, forget any of this happened by Monday. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, as they stepped closer to Agatha’s car…Rio felt her heartstrings tugging her mind back. They grew stronger, shifting the organ to the front lines of all her guards that would shield her from Agatha Harkness. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio knew she was losing it with the idea swimming in the sea of her thoughts. Tidal waves crashing, whirlpools swirling out of control to the point of a vicious storm of their own. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t say it. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shoved her hands in her pockets, lips pulled back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Do not. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stood up a bit taller, tongue swiping the inside of her cheek slowly, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>DON’T FUCKIN-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey uh, do you want to go grab a drink or something? I’m..I’m not doing anything after this, so-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Told you not to do it..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman spun around, the phone in her hand seemingly a device that created a panicked look on Agatha’s face. She looked up from the screen, double checking it before taking a frustrated, defeating sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I gotta’ go” She rushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh uh,” Rio brought a hand to rub over the nape of her neck, tugging a few of the tiny roots to create a pinching sensation. “Right..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha barely said a word. She rushed a few ones that Rio somehow managed to understand. A quick jumble of,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know. We forget this by Monday. Same old shit, right. Bye” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her tone was short, leaving Rio stunned as she watched the vehicle fly out of the parking lot. She watched her disappear down the road. Agatha flew away as if she never existed a few steps ahead of her in the first place. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why would she want to get drinks with you?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This was just so her stupid coupon, thing, whatever didn’t go to waste. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You hate her. She hates you. That’ll never change. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio swallowed the lump in her throat, kicking the tiny pebbles as her feet carried her to the car in defeat. As she fell into her driver’s seat, slamming the door shut and secluding herself from the outside world- That’s when everything hit her all at once. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt the stinging in her eyes, stupid tears threatening to coat her cheeks. Her palm lifted to press over her lips, holding her breath as much as she could so the sobs wouldn’t win. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why did I ask?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Better yet..why did I agree to any of this?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off, Harkness..” She whispered to herself.  </span>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had floored it out of the parking lot the second her Blink camera sent her the front door notification. She figured it was a late Amazon delivery or just a car driving by. But, when she saw the shadow figure sitting on her front porch steps- She knew exactly who it was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her car swung into the driveway, coming to an abrupt stop as her head dipped to see the boy sulking into himself. She turned the engine off, shoulders dropped with a low, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman grabbed her purse and phone, jumping out of the car to meet him where he stayed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not good?” She asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The boy looked up, eyeliner streaks from the tears smudged over his cheeks. A few little gasps were choked as he shook his head. No words were needed between the two. Agatha gestured her finger in the air, stepping around him to unlock the door. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy had become Alice’s teaching assistant early last year. Somehow though, he managed to drift over to Agatha and she had taken him under wing. This wasn't the first time he sat by her doorstep with tears in his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first time he did, Agatha didn’t know what to do. It was over a fight with his mother and he needed a shoulder to cry on. If anyone knew that would be his move, they’d tell him to stay clear and never do such a thing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, Agatha was somewhat happy he did. She didn’t mind being a mentor of sorts. The company to keep around was nice as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sit,” She ordered, but her voice was soft. “I'll grab you something” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned around before entering the kitchen. His voice was small, body fragile as his limbs shook and he held onto himself.  Truly, he didn’t need to say anything or ask. Agatha knew him well enough to know what he wanted, more so needed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can..” He held his breath for a moment. “Can I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, you didn't just think I was telling you to sit. Did you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She asked, pointing over her shoulder down the hallway where the living room sat at the end. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You should know the meaning of that was you're crashing on the couch tonight. Now, go” Agatha directed, disappearing into the kitchen. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard his footsteps patter down the hallway, little sniffles created their own echoing trail. Agatha thought about chasing down the boy who most definitely broke his heart. This had been a battle for months now. A friend of his had flirted, showed signs of wanting more and constantly crushed him over and over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Little twink. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy was head over heels about the boy as well, always making excuses to hang out and find ways to see him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was in the middle of filling up a glass of water when she froze, a thought breaking into her mind like an intruder,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Just like Rio..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She aggressively turned the water off, nearly smacking the cup down on the counter. This wasn’t about her stupid fucking crush on the woman. Tonight was about the emo boy on her couch, a wreck of tears and sorrow. But as she grabbed the package of Oreos, popping one into her mouth- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He’s just like me with this shit..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe she had to kick him to the curb, save him from pining over someone for years like she had been doing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m out of your seltzer shit,” Agatha said as she stepped into the living room. “Water and Oreos will have to do”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She hated any drink that was seltzer, but Billy lived off the stupid things. Usually, she had a stash in the pantry for him. But, he had finished the last one the last time he was at her place. Agatha was supposed to grab more at the store, but obviously someone in particular had distracted her from doing so. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you, Agatha..” He said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>His knees were to his chest, arms locked around with small sniffles. She placed the cup and package down on the coffee table, plopping on the couch beside him. Silence stretched for a few moments between them. Agatha finished chewing down her second Oreo before taking a sigh,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It isn't you..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She moved her elbow on the back of the couch, head resting against her hand. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I just don't get it” He said, voice trembling. “I really…we get along and we were flirting and all the signs are there and-” He scoffed. “It’s like..so close..so fucking close and I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sometimes, life is shit. It misdirects and you just gotta’ roll with it” Agatha shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But what if I'm tired of rolling with it?” He asked, looking over with exhaustion covering his entire soul. “It’s getting worse now. He..he acts like he hates me in public with our friends. We’re entering an </span>
  <em>
    <span>enemy ark</span>
  </em>
  <span> to disguise our </span>
  <em>
    <span>almost could be </span>
  </em>
  <span>one”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ouch. That hits close to home. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Obviously, Agatha couldn’t open up about how well she </span>
  <em>
    <span>truly </span>
  </em>
  <span>understood every word he said. Each syllable, letter, all of it hit her like darts targeting the bullseye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are you doing this?” She asked. “Why do you keep putting yourself through the damn thing?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Are you asking him or yourself?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because..” He sighed. “I just want it to be him, Agatha. I- I only think about him, I have stupid dreams and it’s like we laugh together and I think this is it, we can be more, and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He started to choke on his words, gasping for air as he shook his head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is wrong with me? Am I not enough or-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shushed him while reaching out. She pulled him into her embrace with one arm, feeling his sobs shake every limb that made him his skinny being. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Can I kill this kid? Then he wouldn’t be putting himself through this.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I wanna’ be like you..” He muffled into the flannel shirt. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled back, forcing him to sit up so they were back to eye level. She narrowed her stare, lips frowned while shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re strong, you’re smart like..you’d never put yourself through this!” He said. “I’m weak. I can’t stop myself and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Jesus, kid. You have no idea. You are like me, more than you will ever know. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, holding her hand in the air for him to stop. He was silenced instantly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She started, not knowing where to go with it. How could she? Agatha was doing the same fucking thing and had no idea how to stop herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sometimes the stupid Nicholas Sparks crap, shit show infests us” She said. “It’s shitty, sappy, sickening bullshit that organ in our chest wants-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You mean love, right?” He asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ew” She cringed. “But yeah, whatever you want to call it”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was happy to see his little smile lift. A tiny puff of air that was a ghost of a laugh came from him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We both know logic can only take us so far” Agatha added. “Science hasn’t created a pill to help that-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, technically-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m not talking that crap. This is Nora Roberts territory. Not Stephen King-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you comparing mentally ill people to Stephen King characters?” Billy asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha held her hands out to both sides, eyes wide as she shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Am I wrong?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He rolled his eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s offensive, Agatha”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, what’s offensive is that little </span>
  <em>
    <span>fag</span>
  </em>
  <span> leading you on and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jesus, Agatha!” He groaned. “We talked about that word”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay? And I’m not in a gay bar surrounded by your little friends to offend” She shrugged. “Also, I’m going to insult that nasty boy of yours. I don’t like him and you know it” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He shook his head, muttering how unbelievable she was, but deep down? Billy adored her for it and Agatha knew it. The boy sat back, hands covering his face as his head tilted behind. A loud groan exhaled before silence sat between them again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you still have that rage room thing?” He asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The memory of not even an hour before waved its warm hello. She heard Rio’s laughter in her mind, the smile wide as how those brown orbs sparkled when she touched her up close. The hour had flown by faster than any hour of her lifetime. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha never wanted to leave that room. She never wanted to leave Rio’s side. When they walked out to the parking lot, the impending doom was a portal she stepped through. Rio had been saying something behind her back. Most likely an insult or her chance to make a quick escape. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The words she spoke were definitely about Monday. Rio had been a broken record, saying the order on repeat that put Agatha's heart through the shredder every single time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe Billy crying on her front porch steps made him her savior from hearing that painful speech once more. Agatha wasn’t sure if she could stomach it after being with her. Billy’s words hit hard, they were painfully true. Worse than Agatha could imagine. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We get along. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We laugh. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She clearly is flustered when I flirt. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why can’t we just fucking do it?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m not enough for her. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s way too good for me to ever have. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I couldn’t treat her how she deserves. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Maybe it’s all for the best.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Did you forget about it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>About Rio? Never.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha flipped her head back, eyes wide as she struggled to figure out what he was asking. Her thoughts still bounced like jumping beans, flip flopping at a rapid pace. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Forget what?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He tilted his head to the side, eyes narrowed in on her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The rage room- Have you not been listening again? I know you hate Nora Roberts, but-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes! Yes, sorry uh- Had to think about it. You know Nora Roberts, what that wicked woman does to me”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Billy scoffed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right. She only wrote some of the best books imaginable with pissing specifically </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> off” He argued. “It’s not that you have the </span>
  <em>
    <span>worst</span>
  </em>
  <span> shopping addiction or anything”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her jaw dropped, hand over her heart with a sharp gasp,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you not benefit from my shopping sprees?! I dare say, that gay little wardrobe of yours has excelled since meeting me” She stood up, brushing the Oreos crumbs off her shirt as she muttered, “Not to mention, saved you from those horrendous khakis” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, come on!” He laughed. “I looked adorable in them!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your definition of adorable and mine hold entire different meanings” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shocker there..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She smirked his way before finding the local pizza shop’s menu on the coffee table. In the mess of magazines, books and random puzzle pieces it laid- never needing to be used from how the shop knew her by name, but it was the principal of it. A routine and tradition that must be followed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Here,” She tossed the paper in his lap. “Find us something good to watch, order whatever- I’ve got cash”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, Agatha. I’ll pay, I intru-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha held her head up high as she exited the room, singing a loud,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“LALALA! I CAN'T HEAR YOUUUU” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She heard his laugh, smiling softly to herself for being able to pull him from the tears. Even if it was only momentarily he was able to breathe, better than not having a second at all.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shut the bathroom door behind her, letting go of a breath she hadn’t even realized had been held in. Her hands rested on the edge of the sink, head hanging low as if she could let the thoughts fall into the drain below. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>How Rio’s smile was bright. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>How Rio’s laugh was contagious. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>How Rio’s way of keeping Agatha on her toes, going head to head with her sarcastic wit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio. Rio. Rio. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Three fucking years, a stupid mistake Agatha still dwelled on from their first meeting. Her mother always said people would see the bad in her one way or another. She also reminded Agatha of how evil, cruel, a fuck up she truly was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That was all proven horribly true the first night she laid eyes on the beautiful woman.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“This usually work for you?” Rio gestured between them. “Just…insulting someone off the bat?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha clicked her tongue, head tilting to the side as she tapped her fingers against the wine glass. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“What? Are you not like other girls?” The woman asked. “Don’t like to be brought back down to earth a little bit?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio laughed, rolling her eyes as she shook her head. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You don’t even know who I am to be making the call if I need to be brought back down to earth to begin with” She argued.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I know ‘em when I see ‘em” Agatha shrugged. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The memory of their first meeting haunted her with every glare, every argument, every insult tossed like a hot potato back and forth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>God, why did you have to say that? </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She had asked herself that for three years, always trying to correct her wrongs, but failing to do so at every turn. How could she play nice twenty four seven when Rio never bothered to try herself? Gifting her a cactus, poking the bear to make her growl louder, talking Lilia into moving to a classroom just down the hall to annoy her more-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Why do you keep putting yourself through the damn thing?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The question she had just asked Billy bit her in the ass. Her own mind questioning herself on why she did this. It’d hurt even worse now knowing how good they could have had it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>If Agatha wasn’t a horrible human being.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>If she wasn’t vile and evil. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If only her language wasn’t insults.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’d be the best fucking thing that ever happened to me..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha!” Billy yelled. “Are we doing garlic knots?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She cleared her throat, rolling her shoulders back while she turned her head over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No shit, Sherlock Holmes! And, ooo! Why don’t you consider pizza from the pizza shop as well while you’re at it?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>He never responded, probably too busy rolling his eyes and apologizing to the worker if he heard Agatha on the phone (He did). It gave Agatha time to turn her head to the mirror, seeing the mess of a woman covered in self pity and despair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Monday was around the corner. She just had to survive her first Monday back and fall into the numb habit of continuing on with hating Rio Vidal. Then maybe things would feel lighter than they were right now. She knew well though, no more hanging out one on one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The time they had was good. Like a snack so delicious, you mindlessly could eat the whole bag. Agatha couldn’t just close the wrapper and place it on the shelf. She was an addict. One who had to ditch the chips all together…ditch </span>
  <em>
    <span>Rio, </span>
  </em>
  <span>completely. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded to herself, swallowing the lump in her throat,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I won’t even acknowledge her come Monday. </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span><br />
</span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>Nope. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio Vidal doesn’t exist as far as I’m aware.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Even through her tiny pep talk, a plan that’d feel impossible to go through with- But somehow, she’d manage to do so. There was one question Agatha had asked herself for three years and counting, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why can’t I hate her like she hates me?</span>
  </em>
</p><p><br />

  <p>“And please remember, no exceptions or excuses for tardiness over the next few classes! My door will not be locked, but you will get a mark taken off your grade”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Muttered words and hushed groans echoed through the room. Rio scoffed as she added an amused,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I know! How dare I care about you getting your or better yet, your parents- money's worth of learning..” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A few students chuckled as they gave Rio a soft goodbye while the others stormed out with no word to offer. She forced a small grin, waved to the students who adored her more than the rest, but once the classroom door shut and Rio was left the last man standing?</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She exhaled a long breath, dropping in her desk chair with hands pressed over her face. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Fuck.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>It had been a long week. A painful five days that felt never ending. That feeling was foreign to her. Rio loved her job and at times, the semester felt like two seconds leaving her to wish for more. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>However, this time around? The weekend couldn’t come soon enough. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Monday morning had been the start of the worst week of her life. Five days had gone by achingly slow. Her entire routine was tossed out the window. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>It all started with walking to her classroom Monday morning, her usual routine of being on the phone with Wanda before they went on with their busy day. They would discuss their plans, make a date for drinks for Friday night. That part of her routine was there like clockwork. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>However, what was missing? Better yet, <em> who </em>was missing?</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Fucking Harkness.. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Typically Agatha would tease her from behind in the parking lot (They always arrived at the same time on Mondays. The only day Agatha wasn’t running late) while Rio would be on the phone, hearing Agatha mimic her words. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Yeah, yeah..I know,” Rio sighed. “I’m just- Do we have to go for drinks? Why can’t we just bury ourselves on my couch or yours?” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Wanda scoffed, but Rio didn’t hear her response. Instead her ears focused into the voice behind her.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Oh! How can I possibly leave my plants alone?!” Agatha faked a southern accent (Rio was never sure why that was the common one she used, but whatever). “They must be accompanied at all times. Good golly, I’d say they’re a society of my very own!” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Jesus, hang on-” Rio muttered before spinning around. “The sun has barely risen and you’re already on my nerves-” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Aren’t I always, sugar?” Agatha smirked.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Rio grunted, storming off as she muttered how annoying she was under her breath.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She had grown accustomed to the unbearable woman on her tail. The sudden absence, disturbance in routine left Rio looking over her shoulder, waiting for Agatha to jump out from behind a corner or out of thin air. But alas, she had been left with the same thing. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Nothing.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>No sound.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Not a peep. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Just an empty space behind her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Maybe Agatha was late, that was common. She always ran behind schedule. Her students were more prepared than she ever would be. But as the days progressed, Rio noticed a shift in Agatha’s dynamic with her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She wouldn’t offer a teasing grin. No fingers wiggled in the air with an exaggerated mouthed, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Call me”  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If Rio happened to see her in the hallway, Agatha would quickly shield herself or dodge her before their eyes were even able to connect. Rio almost felt as if she was a nuisance and their dynamic became the reverse. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> This is what you’ve always wanted.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio told herself those words on repeat. She tried to think about how she didn't have to endure Agatha’s antics, be chased from the parking lot to her classroom, feel those piercing blue eyes watching her every move. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha was leaving Rio the hell alone like she had told her to do for three years now. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> This is what you’ve always wanted.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Not to mention, Rio’s other command had been followed like an order. A strict obligation for the past weekend to even happen. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> This weekend never happened.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>And just as she demanded, the weekend seemingly ceased to exist. It was almost as if Agatha and her had made a pact to never acknowledge the other again. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Isn’t that even more than you asked for? </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>A few knocks on her classroom door snapped her back awake. She hadn’t fallen asleep, only sunk into the pit of despair over anything else. A daze that only involved Agatha Harkness. Which wasn’t a shocker with how often Rio had drifted off to that place in her mind. The corner tucked in the back, cobwebs and darkness eliminated. Now a shining bright light with just a lone stool, a photo of Agatha beside it. </p>
  <p><br />Rio shook her hands to rid the jitters, rolling her neck as she pushed herself up, shuffling around the desks-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Maybe it’s her. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The three words punched her in the chest. Her hopes skyrocketed, she felt her heart kick into gear, hands made work to straighten her outfit- A black button up top, slim pair of black slacks. Nothing fancy and if it was Agatha at the door- Suddenly Rio wished she dressed better. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> What? Stop caring how you look for her, idiot.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She mentally groaned, hating herself more than she had in years. With a deep breath, trembling hands, Rio opened the door to find-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Afternoon, freak” Alice smiled. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Dammit.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Hey,” Rio sighed, leaning against the doorframe as she forced a small smile herself. “Heading out early?” She gestured to the bag on Alice’s shoulder.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Yeah, cancelled my last class”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Playing hooky with Kale again?” Rio smirked a bit. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She watched the woman’s cheeks begin to burn. How her eyes sparkled, looking away while her foot kicked at the floor. Rio laughed, amused by the little girl crush her friend wore. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> If only my crush was that easy- Not a crush. Stop it.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“It’s cute,” Rio shrugged. “Odd duo, stuck up bitch, but..cute” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Alice scoffed. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“She’s not that bad”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“You’re only saying that because you’re going down on her…or the reverse? You know what,” Rio put her finger up, scrunching her nose as she shook her head. “I don’t want to know” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>They both chuckled, but were cut off as Billy (William? Rio never knew which name that boy went by) flew by with two coffees in his hands. His breath was short, rapid as his shoulders raised up and down. He gave a little smile, nodding to them both before asking,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Hey, have you guys seen-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“They’re in the library” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Alice finished for him, knowing exactly who he was looking for and also? She did not want Rio to catch on for who he was looking for and <em> why </em>he was searching for them. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Great, thank you” He sighed. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Going against Alice’s hopes to swiftly push him away, distract and get Rio to walk out with her early. The young man crushed her attempt with unintentional ease.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I swear, Agatha’s coffee days will be the death of me” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Shit.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Oh, coffee Friday?” Rio perked up. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Mhm” He smiled. “You know how it is” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She smirked a bit. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Yeah, I-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Might want to catch them before they fly off,” Alice weakly smiled. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>He nodded, saying a quick goodbye to them both before rushing down the hall. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>After being ignored by Agatha for the last five days, drowning in the memories of the weekend- Rio (unfortunately) was excited to hear Agatha was doing her monthly coffee run. Where she picked a random Friday and bought coffee for everyone. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>(Well, <em> everyone </em> meaning the staff in their department…more so, just the few people Agatha tolerated)</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Of course, Rio never pitched in by giving William her order. However, that didn’t leave her with nothing. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha would always decide for her. Hence why part of her was excited. She loved seeing what the annoying woman came up with, but even worse? Now, it was a way to connect herself to Agatha. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The woman's absence felt hollowing the last few days. Rio was eager to let a small coffee cup designed by her help her with it. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><em> Oh, what am I becoming? </em>Rio wondered. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Assuming mine is left in the break room per normal?” She asked. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Though as Alice’s smile faded, looking elsewhere while she hid behind her coffee-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“What’s that face for?” Rio asked. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Alice shrugged, running a hand through her hair while avoiding Rio’s stare.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Uh..well, that’s the thing-” She nervously laughed before quickly mumbling the words, “All the coffees have been..<em> given </em>”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Okay? Where’s mine?” Rio questioned, but realized the answer not a second later. “Wow-” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“She didn’t say anything to me!” Alice put her hands up in defense. “All I know is there’s no other-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Yeah! K’, cool…got it. Thanks!”  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio disappeared into her classroom, slamming the door shut behind her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha was ignoring her, disappearing left and right and now wouldn’t even include Rio for a stupid coffee? <em> What the fuck?! </em> She excluded her, made her the odd one out. While everyone strided around with their large cup of coffee, wearing smiles and laughter from the joy a simple drink could bring- Rio stood with nothing.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Fucking bitch.. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Sure, this is what Rio had always wanted. But after their weekend together? How things felt completely different off campus with just one another around? She’d be lying if she said this is <em> exactly </em>what she had truly desired. If anything, the more time that passed left Rio to realize this was the polar opposite. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>All she had to do was laugh Agatha off, storm out of that store and never look back. Agatha would still be teasing her, annoying her and the best of all?</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> I’d never know what could be..what we could be.. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio rushed to grab her belongings, desperate to get home and bask in the glory of her liquor cabinet or maybe a few beers. Rio would know which vice she needed when her pajamas were on, a shitty movie was on the screen, and reality truly struck her for the mess she had created. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She looked around, making sure everything was in her hands. With a few heavy breaths, the classroom door locked behind her- Rio turned to see two staff members laughing with the coffee cups in their hands. She curled her lips in a snarl, scrunched her nose in disgust, muttering under her breath, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Fuck off, Harkness..”</p>
  <hr />
  <p>Rio used her shoulder to push the door open, stepping into the parking lot as she texted Wanda back about meeting for drinks. As much as she didn’t want to go out, getting drunk with others was a better idea over drinking alone. Sometimes she was smart. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Key word, <em> sometimes.  </em></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Shit!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio’s head snapped up from her phone when the word was shouted. She searched across the lot for the voice’s owner, scanning each row until-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Agatha.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The woman was crouched down on the cement, picking up the items that had flown out of her bag. Rio’s heart thundered, alarms in her mind going off with a warning to flee the scene. The petty side of her wanted to do just as Agatha had been. Ignore, dodge, turn a blind eye and not offer her anything. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, that wasn’t in Rio’s nature. Even if they were still enemies (More than they seemingly were now) she’d help her pick the mess up. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio slipped her phone in her pocket, jogging over before her knees nearly scraped across the cement just as Agatha’s belongings had. Her hands worked to pick up the miscellaneous items. A deck of playing cards, mascara, a pack of gum and a tiny baggy of cinnamon discs. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><em> This is so Agatha.. </em>Rio tried to not grin as she thought it over. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She didn’t notice how the woman beside her jumped, froze, her own anxiety screaming inside. Rio was too busy picking up the other items, handing them to Agatha with a small smile. One that was nervous, careful to not scare her off. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>However, Agatha never looked up at her. There was no smile in return, no witty comment about Rio being her savior or something like so. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha stood back on her feet with ease. She tucked her purse back together, straightening her clothes and never turning her attention to the woman stunned below. All she offered was a low, clipped, barely coherent, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Thanks..” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Before turning around, storming off and leaving stunned behind. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Seriously? </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She scoffed, shaking her head as she muttered a snarky reply to the one worded <em> graciousness </em> Agatha had given her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Yeah, don’t be too enthusiastic over it or anything..” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio had started to walk away, missing how Agatha spun around the second she had opened her mouth. All she heard was the sarcastic wit, attitude coating her tone,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Oh! Silly me! I’m just jumping for joy for how I almost just broke my phone and all my shit went flying across the parking lot. Hip-hip-<em> fucking- </em>horray!”  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio turned back around, being met with a harsh glare that Agatha never showed. Sure, they glared at one another. But, it wasn’t the ice cold icicle being stabbed through her right then. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Who knew I’d miss her playful glare so much? </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Standing in the university’s parking lot on a late Friday afternoon, Rio was learning how Agatha couldn’t hide annoyance and anger to save her life. That was for sure. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Jeez. Sorry I helped, I guess” Rio said. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha scoffed. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Oh, cry me a river, Vidal!”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“What is up your ass?!” Rio asked. “You’re acting as if I am the worst human being by helping pick your mess up!”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha laughed with no humor. Only malicious intent and rage filled its tone. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Whatever” Rio muttered, shaking her head as she went to turn around. “Go back to acting as if I don’t exist”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha’s laughter stopped, lips curled up slowly as she snarled back, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Monday morning, back to usual. Act like that weekend <em> never </em> happened. Sound familiar?” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio swallowed, taking a step back in case she needed to run. Not from the truth or how right Agatha was. This was her own fault and Rio knew it. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>More so she’d be running because <em> fuck, </em> Agatha’s anger was terrifying. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She looked on the verge of lunging out, strangling Rio’s throat- Not the way she had dreamt about either. Everyone knew Agatha was a powerful being, someone who was a force to be reckoned with, but..this was different. Terrifyingly different. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio shook her head, voice starting to waver with every word,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“This is different. Not usua-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“How so?” Agatha questioned, arms folded against her chest as her foot began to tap. “Hm? I’m doing exactly as you wanted and more! You’ve told me for years to leave you alone. I’d say I’m giving you the entire package!”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio shook her head. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“That’s not fair”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> It is fair.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“You're acting as if I don't exist. After the weekend, I-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“The weekend never happened! You said it yourself multiple times!” She exclaimed. “God!” Agatha scoffed, looking away with her hand running through her hair. “I can’t do anything right when it comes to you” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio opened her lips to say something, but the words were vacant. They vanished into thin air, being replaced with a silence that spoke louder than her voice ever could. She felt like a dam had been built in front of her, impossible to break through and let the flood drown Agatha out. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Yeah..” Agatha scoffed. “Exactly. So, goodbye Rio” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She watched as Agatha turned, making her way back to the car that Rio hated she missed. Rio was frozen, her heart begging to stop her while every other piece of her told her to turn around, give it up. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio did this. She had created the damage between them by begging, pleading for years the woman left her alone. Her wish was true, the genie in a bottle granted her that. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>So why the hell was she pissed off watching Agatha walk away? </p>
  <p>Why did Rio care that Agatha didn’t want anything to do with her? </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Well…to be fair- </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“You started this”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The three childish words escaped before Rio was able to catch them. On one half, she was lucky for how they were successful by making Agatha stop in her tracks. The other though? </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Oh, I’m dead.. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha started to take dangerously slow steps, head tilted as her eyes narrowed in as if Rio was her prey. She was circling, pointing, ready to attack and kill her with one swing.</p>
  <p>“What are you talking about, Rio?” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Her voice was low, daring Rio to argue and worst of all? </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Jesus. The way she says my name is so stupidly attractive. Fucking hell.. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio cleared her throat, standing up taller, a hand gesturing out with every word,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Years ago the night we met. You were an ass-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“And I’ve spent three years trying to make that wrong a right!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha yelled, the veins in her neck sticking out stronger with every word. Rio jumped in her spot, leaning back as Agatha started to charge toward her. No more dangerous slow steps, a full on run Rio should move from. Turn around, run away before she’d be slaughtered to death in the university’s parking lot. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>But instead, Rio stayed put. She braced herself for the impact, but couldn’t prepare for the way her stomach swirled as Agatha was just a shy four steps away. Close enough to feel her presence stronger than crouched down beside her. She leaned back, fists scrunched into balls while her heart pounded like a bass drum.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha’s vanilla conditioner was strong, the smell of coffee still lingered on her lips and those piercing blue eyes looked frozen. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I know!” She tossed her arms out. “I’m so wicked and evil for how I read the situation wrong! Damn me to hell for eternity-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Agatha-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I thought you’d be one into a bit of competitive flirting, my fucking bad for being wrong. I didn’t realize you’d punish me for years over that. Hell, if I did- We would have never talked!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Yeah?! Well maybe that’s how it should’ve stayed!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio yelled, pushing forward so their faces were inches away, but that didn’t last long. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Just as quick as they were close to touching, silently debating attacking the other in a brutal kiss to end whatever this feud was. They leaned away from one another in sync. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Both of their faces filled with rage shifted into something unreadable to one another. Rio swallowed the lump in her throat, watching as Agatha ripped her eyes away. Before she did so, Rio saw the water melting the frozen blue orbs that had lost all strength. She didn’t miss how Agatha visibly trembled, lifting her head to speak, but instead just stormed off quicker than before. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>And suddenly, Rio preferred Agatha’s life threatening anger over the back of her body as she ran off.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She stayed in her spot, unable to move while staring into the void space Agatha left. Down the parking lot the car door slammed shut, flying off as soon as the engine was turned on. Agatha was there and she was gone in what felt like less than thirty seconds. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio sucked her cheeks in, holding arms over her stomach while no other thoughts were in her mind. Only the hollowing question, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> What just happened? </em>
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>Rio sprawled every limb over the couch, draping herself as if she were a blanket. A half empty tub of rocky road ice cream tucked in her side, whiskey bottle on the floor in arms reach, with a crappy reality TV show she was definitely not paying attention to. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She wasn’t sure how long it had been since she had trudged through her front door. The only few things she focused on was letting Nicky outside and making sure he was fed. Kicking her shoes off, grabbing a bottle of whiskey and ice cream (A perfect dinner. Gordon Ramsey would most certainly be proud) and collapsing with a thud onto the couch.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Everything else was background, nothing mattered nor did she have the energy for it all. The fight with Agatha lived in her mind as a being separate from her own self. She couldn’t control the memory. It carried its own heart, pulse, thoughts and life. If Rio could gain control, she would’ve by now. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>To be fair, the whiskey most likely wasn’t helping the memory’s existence die. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Oh, what the fuck” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio jumped, but never bothered to sit up. Her head shot over to the redhead standing above her. The woman’s eyes roaming her up and down, scanning around the room with Nicky sniffing her up and down. She slowly started to laugh, holding her hands up with a shake of her head. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Nuh-uh, nope!” She laughed, reaching for the TV remote to turn the show off. “There’s no way one Tinder date gone wrong is going to do this to you”</p>
  <p><br />“What the hell?” Rio whined. “Where did you come from?! Ever heard of knocking-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Ever heard of cancelling plans? Maybe answering your phone so I know you aren’t dead?” She countered, arms folded tight against her chest. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda reached down, snatching her phone off the coffee table and scoffed at the black screen facing her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Course,” She scoffed, holding it up for Rio to see. “Why charge the device that lets me know you’re alive?” </p>
  <p><br />Rio shrugged. “More fun that way”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Yeah, so is letting me know you’re staying home” She said, rolling her eyes. “Especially when you’re..” She waved her hand up and down. “What is this, exactly?”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“You barging into my house, that’s what this is..” Rio grumbled. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda let out a laugh, tossing her head back as she held her hands up theatrically. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Okay, sure- That’s the answer!” She exclaimed. “Not the fact you’ve obviously been sobbing your eyes out, not even in your pajamas, a bottle of whiskey and to top it all off?!”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She leaned down, ripping the ice cream container from her hold. Her eyes squinted, nose scrunched as she realized-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Liquid ice cream” Wanda said, returning her eyes back to Rio. “But, you’re so right. Nothing else is the issue here” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda smirked as Rio’s demeanor sunk back into herself. She twiddled with her thumbs, pulled her bottom lip back between her teeth with a small shrug. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Maybe I like my ice cream liquid-y now. Ever consider that?” She mumbled.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Oh,” Wanda nodded, clicking her tongue with a wink. “Makes sense. You also love sulking in your work clothes while crying and drinking whiskey. Man, this new Rio era is really <em> not </em> a problem at all”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Exactly!” Rio said, holding her hand in the air. “Now, give me back my liquid dessert and head for the door-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“No and no,” Wanda declined. “I am going to plug your phone in, put this soup of yours away and you-” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She pointed, finding the box of tissues to toss at her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“You’re going to sit up, use a few of these and when I get back- Tell me what the hell is going on” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda was exiting the room, but not without swiping the whiskey bottle Rio had taken a hold of out of her hand. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio groaned, throwing her head back with a whine. “I hate you!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I know you do!” Wanda called back. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She listened to the woman putting away her two favorite vices, plugging her phone in and most definitely getting herself a bottle of wine. Rio didn’t blame her there. If she found Wanda in this state, she’d need an entire liter of vodka to make it through. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio forced herself to sit up before Wanda would do it for her. She tucked her knees up to her chest, Nicky jumping up to snuggle in beside her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I guess you’re better than snuggling liquid ice cream..” Rio murmured, leaning down to kiss the top of his head. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda snickered as she strided back into the room. </p>
  <p>“I’d argue much better, but..” She dropped the water bottle in her lap, dropping on the other end of the couch beside her. “To each their own” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The silence remained for a minute or so. Wanda allowed Rio to blow her nose, wipe the remaining tears and take a few sips of her water. She gave her time to collect herself the best she could, letting her study close and try to pick apart what (Better yet, <em> who) </em> created this version of her best friend. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda stared…and stared- Rio side glancing every few seconds until she shifted uncomfortably in her spot. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I think she’s judging us..” Rio mumbled against Nicky's head, hiding her face behind him. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The redhead smirked, taking a sip from her wine before exhaling a sigh. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Not judging, simply…reading-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Judging” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Investigating” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“You aren’t on the payroll for such a thing” Rio rolled her eyes. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I work for a nonprofit,” Wanda shrugged. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Oh yeah? What’s your organization called? Far Too Nosy Redheads?”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Hmm,” Wanda hummed, pretending to think about it. “We debated that title for awhile, but ended up going with a third party recommendation” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio chuckled. “Oh really? And what was the recommendation?” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><em> “You Can’t Keep Distracting the Redhead Nonprofit Investigator Society” </em> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio’s smirk faded, eyes lowered back to the boy snuggled in her side. She heard Wanda humming her successful tune. The one that sang, <em> “I won” </em>their back and forth. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Society? That makes you sound like the leader of some cult..” She muttered. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Well then, you should feel honored you’re my first vulnerable soul to be corrupted” Wanda replied. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The amusement in Wanda’s voice was cut, tone short, not letting Rio prolong their conversation any longer. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Now. Out with it. What’s the pity party about?” She asked. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio looked up before back down. She shifted her body left to right, clearing her throat as her fuzzy drunken mind tried to scramble an excuse together. All the words felt jumbled, coherent thoughts non existent. One vision stayed clear in her mind, a look that only made her stomach feel sicker than the whiskey ever could. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“What is going on in there?” Wanda asked. “I’m not even in your brain and I feel sick-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Is that an insult?” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Just an observation” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She shrugged, taking a slow sip from her wine, allowing Rio a few more seconds to reply. But when she didn’t, Wanda simply sighed, her heart breaking for whatever happened to her best friend. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio had rarely looked so destroyed in her life. Only when her father passed could it compare. And as heavy as that weighed, the destruction it had caused- Wanda would be a liar if she said this didn’t feel different. She was dressed in remorse, covered in despair, wreaked of guilt like never before. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Rio, what the hell did you do? </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I won’t let you dodge my ques-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“That stupid Tinder date” Rio lied and <em> shit- </em>That even sounded pathetic to her. “It..y’know, got ghosted and-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“You were over the moon having an excuse to delete Tinder” Wanda pointed out. “That’s not it, you’re a horrible liar and we both know it”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Wow..” Rio puffed out a hint of a laugh. “You’re just <em> lovely </em> company to have, aren’t you?”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She looked up to find Wanda smiling big, holding her wine glass in the air with a tiny bow, an arm extended out to her side. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“What can I say? I’m just a gem”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“A gem that’s a pain in my ass” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“What about a rose thorn in your side? Sounds prettier” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Nope” Rio popped the p, shaking her head. “You’re too aggravating to be a peaceful pain” She shrugged. “Up my ass hurts worse”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Not a fan of ana-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio groaned, grabbing a pillow to hold over her face, voice muffled as she yelled,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Ew! Ugh, fuck off. Go home. Leave me be!” </p>
  <p><br />Wanda laughed as she choked on the red liquid that felt perfect on her tongue, delicious to sweeten this bitter moment. Well…maybe bitter was a bit too harsh. Making Rio cringe through her apparent breakdown was humorous, after all. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I will do such a thing when you admit to what’s going on!” She exclaimed.  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio grumbled under her breath. A variety of words that all added up to the same result,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “This is so stupid” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Typically, Wanda would continue arguing until Rio either gave up the answer in a rage or turned into a puddle on the floor. Luckily for her though, she could tell Rio was reaching her breaking point. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>It showed how she was fidgeting with Nicky’s ear, her tongue swiping the inside of her cheek every now and then, lips pulled back, fingers tapping rhythmically against her knee. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Agatha got coffee for everyone”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda had been taking a small sip of wine, thinking she had more time before Rio confessed. Though as the wine glass sat against her lips, studying Rio to see if this was one of her annoying jokes. Where she’d say anything to dodge the actual question, the real conversation, to avoid the truth all together. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> She isn’t joking..? </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The woman swallowed, clearing her throat before asking,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“So..why uh- You care she bought coffee for everyone? I thought you hated when she-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Everyone but me!” Rio yelled through a strong laugh. “Everyone else in that damn building got a coffee!”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Okay, building was an exaggeration. BUT! Still! Rio was the only staff member who didn’t have a coffee purchased by Agatha in her hand. That earned her the right to react this way. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Anyone else who had been left out for coffee day would react the same way…<em> right? </em> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“And what do I get?! I get that <em> bitch </em>having the audacity to fight me in the parking lot- AFTER PICKING UP HER THINGS!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda was a deer in headlights. A confused deer to be exact and that was probably still too light of a word for it. She felt frozen, eyes wide as she watched the meltdown happen live in action. Rio’s voice was cracking, hands waving in the air as her words screamed out. Her eyes only drifted to see the dog burying himself deeper in Rio’s side, thinking softly to herself, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Poor Nicky. You’re such a trooper.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“She’s such a bitch Wanda, I-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Okay, okay” Wanda held her hand up, chuckling softly. “Slow down for one, how much did you have to drink? I’m so confus-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio continued, but not with the answers Wanda was exactly looking for. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“And I didn’t know telling her to forget the weekend would mean this!” She yelled, balling up her fist as she shook her head. “If I did, I-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Honey, you gotta’ guide me here. I’m lost” She chuckled. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As if Wanda’s voice wasn’t gentle, almost like Rio was at the interrogation table with a lightbulb shining on her- She broke under the heated pressure. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio’s head shook, she made Nicky jump off the couch when she screamed the words that the neighbours were sure to hear. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“We hung out! Okay?!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda watched as her best friend was trembling physically and vocally. She was picking at her fingernails, shaking her head as if she was trying to ruin her brain. Every little action Wanda analyzed, the words that pieced the woman’s current state together-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Oh my god.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She brought the wine glass up to her lips, tipping back with one swig while wishing it was the entire bottle. Truthfully, Wanda would need an entire case if the direction they were going in was to the destination she already knew. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio had her heart broken a few years ago. It was the last time she really opened herself to date anyone. After that, Rio shut down straight into ultra work mode. Natasha and Wanda tried everything to get her out of it, but no dice. Tinder was a massive breakthrough, but that had failed and they couldn’t put up an argument over it. Rio was stood up, that was enough to allow the app to be gone. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>And yet during all of their scheming, plotting, brainstorming on how to get their friend back out there-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Agatha Harkness. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The name was never hated by Wanda. She remembered three years ago when Rio said those two words, gave her the rundown of their first encounter- Wanda went home that night to Natasha with the words, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “There’s something about that name”  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Natasha looked up from her phone with a small smirk.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Agatha sounds like it belongs to an old woman? Is that i-” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Shut up” Wanda sighed, playfully smacking her shoulder. “Listen to me!”  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Okay, okay” Natasha put her phone down, hands up in surrender. “You have my undivided attention, honey” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Wanda rolled her eyes, crashing on the couch beside her. She shook her head, biting at her bottom lip as the name echoed off every wall in her mind.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> There was something about the way Rio said her name. Their first encounter as well may have been a subtle amount of flirting before it crashed. She didn’t think that was it. Even if Rio said they didn’t flirt or never even spoke, Wanda would be feeling something in her gut.  </em>
  </p>
  <p><em> <br /></em> <em> “You’re usually right about these things..” Natasha said. “So..what’s the name telling you” </em></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Wanda scoffed. “You’re gonna’ laugh” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Try me,” Natasha said. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> She tugged her lips back between her teeth, nibbling until letting them loose to explain.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “She’s the one..” Wanda shrugged. “I- I don’t know how else to explain it besides…the way Rio said it, even if she’s annoyed by her and all like-” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Natasha didn’t say anything, knowing well to let the silence linger, give her space to continue on when she was ready  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Rio and Agatha. Agatha and Rio. Rio Vidal, Agatha Harkness- It works”  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Hm..” Natasha hummed. “She’s stubborn, you have to keep that in mind. Don’t get your hopes up” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Wanda had been trying for months to push her best friend back out there, eager to see her fall in love like she deserved. Natasha had been supportive, helpful, but still kept her grounded before she could truly get her hopes out of hand.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “I just want to see her happy. Am I too obsessive about this?” She looked over to find Natasha giving a small smile. “Am I?” She repeated.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Natasha shook her head. “You’re a good friend” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Well..mark my words. This is it” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “I believe you,” She nodded. “Guess we’ll see how it plays out” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “You know, I said awhile ago Rio was destined for an enemies to lovers plot” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> The other woman laughed, tucking a piece of red hair behind Wanda’s ear.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “I can see it” </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Right?!” Wanda grinned. “It makes so much sense!”  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio groaned, hands covering her face as she dug the heel of her palms into her cheeks. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“She bought my stupid ice cream and snacks” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She began and <em> oh lord, </em>Wanda would never guess where the confession was heading. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“We spoke for hours and then we went to a rage room- Which my shoulder is still sore from and that was all because I accidentally liked her stupid Instagram post and this-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio hiccuped, struggling to take a breath through a few tiny coughs. Wanda went into action, putting her wine glass down to exchange it for the water bottle. She twisted the cap, holding it to her with a soft, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Hey, hey..” Wanda said. “Drink some water, catch your breath” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Reluctantly, Rio took the water from her. She took a few sips, caught her breath and wiped tears before they could reach her cheeks. The woman shook her head, muttering under her breath,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I hate her so much..” Rio lied. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda snickered. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I don’t think you would be here a drunken mess if that were the case..”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio shrugged. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Who knows? Maybe this is-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Don’t do that” Wanda said, the softness in her voice gone as if it was never there. “Listen, I won’t press you harder tonight for information about…how the hell you two hung out-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Good. I’m too tired”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda gave a soft smile. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Too drunk as well”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I’m not that-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Rio, honey you’re slurring every other word..” Wanda said. “Besides, I know you. Let’s just..watch something on TV. If you want to talk, I’m all ears”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She reached forward for the remote, grabbing the fleece blanket to lay over their legs. Rio wouldn’t say it, too lost in her emotions, but…she was thankful for Wanda beyond words. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>When Rio ended up in this state of mind, it was hard to talk about anything. Especially making sense through each word. Not to mention, she had just confessed to hanging out with her worst enemy of all time. Part of her knew when she was good and sober, Wanda would most likely recruit Natasha to gang up on her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Wait- </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“You’re just waiting for Natasha to be back in town to interrogate me..huh?”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Natasha was away for work for the weekend, due to come home the following week. Rio wasn’t surprised when Wanda snickered, leaning back as she scrolled through Netflix’s wide selection. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I hate the both of you..” Rio grumbled. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“More than Agatha Harkness now, apparently” Wanda replied. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“No. I still really hate her” Rio lied. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Mhm. Okay, Rio” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I do!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I’m not saying you don’t!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I hate her”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Yep. Keep drinking water, drunkie” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Wanda popped the p, not letting the argument go on as she selected Grace and Frankie to watch for the millionth time together. Rio did as she told her, slumping in her spot more as the theme song started to roll. Normally they’d sing it horribly together, but Rio was too busy thinking to herself-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> I still hate her…don’t I?</em>
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>The following night rolled around far too soon for Rio’s liking. Saturday night, one day closer to Monday when she’d have to face Agatha all over again. Plus, another day closer to when Natasha and Wanda were certain to break her door down. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>They’d be around for dinner Thursday night with relentless questions about what happened. It wasn’t even Sunday and Rio was dreading that night far more than having to see Agatha. Maybe both were the same amount of nightmare fuel. <em> Fuck. </em>Rio didn’t even want to think about it. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Doomscrolling on her phone, trying to numb the ache in her heart and soothe the upset stomach that hadn’t settled since their fight- A notification from Instagram popped up on the top of her screen, words that made her entire body freeze. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk1.jpeg" alt="AgathaDrunkt1” width=" height="600" align="middle" />
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio stared at the two broken messages. What else was she able to do besides just…stare? </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> She can’t be talking to me.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> This has to be a mistake. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>That was it. Just a text to the wrong person. She should lock her phone, drag herself to bed and let Agatha figure out it wasn’t her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio shouldn’t have been surprised how her thumbs tapped the letters off her keyboard, not allowing herself to follow the logical path. Instead, she was going to ask for clarity- See the obvious answer for herself. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk2.jpeg" alt="AgathaDrunk2" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Holy shit. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> She’s drunk.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> Agatha is drunk texting me.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Oh my god..” Rio mumbled. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>And before she could reply, Agatha continued on with a string of messages. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk3.jpeg" alt="AgathaDrunk3" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> We had fun.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> If we matched on Tinder.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> She knows I don’t always hate her- </em>
  </p>
  <p>“Fuck!” Rio harshly whispered. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She quickly sat up in bed, holding her phone tighter as if she could stop Agatha’s messages from coming through. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio had to shut this down before she went on any longer. She was drunk, this was all meaningless. Even if the saying was drunken tongue, sober thoughts come out- </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Whatever the hell it was, Rio couldn’t figure it out right then and there. Her mind was planning, plotting, flying on a whim to try and put a stop to whatever this conversation was turning into. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk4.jpeg" alt="AgathaDrunk4" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As much as Rio wanted to shut this down, turn her phone off and disappear into slumber she wished to never wake up from. Not in a suicidal way, but to ignore reality for the rest of her life. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, it was never that easy. Rio’s personality, who she was- It cursed her as it did in the parking lot. Where she felt compelled to help Agatha pick up her belongings, now she felt it was her responsibility to make sure the drunk woman she hated and yet missed was safe. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio wasn’t surprised to see the following texts of Agatha admitting to where she was. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk5.jpeg" alt="AgathaDrunk5" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> A bar.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“That’s…not helpful, Agatha” Rio whispered to herself, running a hand through her hair. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She needed more information to work with. There were multiple bars in town, Agatha could possibly not even be in town to find her in one. Rio shook her head, typing as part of her brain begged her to stop. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunk6.jpeg" alt="AgathaDrunk6" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Lou Miller.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The universe had granted her a saving grace for knowing exactly who she was talking about. Lou was an old friend of Rio’s from college. They were still friends, but life had taken them in opposite directions. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>At first, relief was the only thing running through her mind. She knew where Agatha was, she would be able to track her down and check on her first hand- Let her eyes lay on her, see the woman was safe. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Drunk, but…safe. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Fuck, why do I even care?” Rio muttered.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She pushed herself out of bed, grabbing a hoodie and a pair of black jeans. Her feet rushed through the house, making sure Nicky was content on the couch while pulling her hair up in a hair clip. If Rio wasn’t so worried, she’d cringe at how much of a mess she looked. Especially seeing Agatha, but..</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><em> She’s drunk. She won’t even remember any of this. </em> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio grabbed her keys, opened her phone back up to shoot Agatha another message. On one side, she wanted to confirm it was Lou she was talking about. On the other, she needed to know Agatha wasn’t so far gone to not reply to her anymore. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://images.squidge.org/images/2025/05/01/AgathaDrunkFinal.jpeg" alt="AgathaDrunk7" width="397" height="600" align="middle" />
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Why not me?  </em>
  </p>
  <p>She found a way to choke on air, a few coughs as she struggled to shut the front door behind her. Rio held tight onto the doorknob, eyes wide as she stared at the text messages. The previous ones started to sink into her mind as well. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Would you be jealous if I fucked her? </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> I’d rather fuck you, Rio.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> I shouldn’t say that. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“She’s drunk..” Rio told herself, collecting enough strength to make her way to the car while chanting like a mantra, “She’s drunk. She’s drunk. She’s drunk”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Shaking her head, feeling her heart racing to the point her pulse thundered up into her throat- Rio managed to tap Lou’s contact while turning the key in the ignition. She put the car in drive, taking off out of her driveway as if she was fleeing a crime scene and needed to escape the police behind her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The phone rang a few times, on the verge of being met with her voicemail. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Come on..” Rio muttered, fingers tapping against the steering wheel. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Just as she was about to give up hope, make another plan to drive around incase Agatha managed to leave before she got there-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Rio Vidal, long time since you’ve rang” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Australian voice rasped with a laugh and Rio let out the longest exhale of relief in her entire life. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“What’s going on?” Lou asked. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Yeah, hey- Uh, you have a mess of a woman at your bar right now. Wild brown hair, um-” Rio sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I don’t fucking know what she’s wearing…maybe a flannel or-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Harkness?” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><em> Harkness. </em> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio sighed, relieved she located Agatha. “Yeah. Make sure she stays where she is, please?” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Lou didn’t say anything for a moment, worrying Rio she wasn’t currently working or maybe found the request weird. She wouldn’t blame her. Rio was basically asking a friend she hadn't spoken to in ages to keep a random woman hostage. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“How do you know her?” She asked. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio shook her head as if Lou was able to see her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Long story, not enough time- Just, make sure she doesn’t move and stop serving her” She ordered. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Sir yes sir..” Lou muttered. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Thank you, seriously” She sighed. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The phone call ended, leaving Rio to hear the sound of her car and thoughts racing faster than the fifty miles per hour she was flying at. Her grip on the steering wheel tightened, jaw clenched as her fear about Agatha leaving paused for a moment. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The texts started to flicker through her mind, envisioning every single one word for word. There were a few that held their own collection of, <em> holy fuck. </em>But one in particular stood out the most above all. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio stopped at the red light, looking around before whispering to herself outloud,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“She wants to fuck me?”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <hr />
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio pulled into the tiny parking lot, barely turning the engine off before jumping out of the car. Her body felt on high alert, struck with fear as if she was walking into her death sentence. A firing squad behind the front door, lethal injection that’d be stabbed in her veins the second she stepped through the threshold. Everything felt like a dooming end and yet? </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>None of it mattered. Rio would walk into fire without a second thought if it meant at the end, Agatha was safe. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> This is insane.. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She ignored her thoughts to push the door open, being welcomed to the grunge atmosphere. Lou wasn’t one for fancy places. She bought the dive bar years ago when her on and off girlfriend had been sentenced to a lengthy prison stay. It was something to distract her, keep her busy and unsurprisingly? She had made a decent name for herself. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio scanned each person, looked around the sea of people until her eyes found the crazed brown hair at the bar. The same blue flannel she wore at the rage room, her body slumped with a hand gesturing in the air- probably slurring and rambling on about something. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Too busy threading herself through the crowd of sweaty, drunk, messy people- Rio didn’t register the song that played through the speakers. If she did..well, it’d be another mental curse out for Wanda to shut up about the universe’s signs. Sparks by Coldplay and ironically, Rio didn't even like Coldplay. But if she heard the lyrics, they'd feel way too realistic to what was happening with them both.</p>
  <p> </p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio reached out, gently placing her hand on Agatha’s shoulder- Thankfully her adrenaline was running its own marathon to ignore how a simple touch felt like a million voltages electrocuting her all at once. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Aga-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Well!” Agatha yelled, the words all slurred into one. “Look who it is, everybody!” She waved her arm around, head tilted back as she yelled over the music. “My number one hater!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Lou walked over, drying the glass in her hand with a small grin. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Vidal” She greeted. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio looked over her shoulder with a nod. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Thank you” She mouthed. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Lou winked. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“She was about to take off just a few minutes ago, bribed her with a drink” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Bribe me?!” Agatha laughed. “I can’t be bribed! I’m immortal!”</p>
  <p>If she were sober, Rio would totally be making fun of her for how that made zero sense. Instead, she just shook her head while grabbing Agatha’s jacket and purse. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Come on, I’m taking you home” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha shook her head. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I’m not done yet and also, no! I’m not spending time with you to go to work tomorrow and you hate me all over again!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Lou snorted, muttering under her breath. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Don’t think Sunday means work..”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio subtly glared back at her, but returned her attention to tug Agatha’s arm towards her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Just, please?” Rio asked. “Walk with me at the least” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Keeping my enemy closeeeee” Agatha giggled. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Good, that works. Follow the saying” Rio nodded. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio managed to help Agatha off the barstool. She pulled her wallet out with one hand, keeping the other holding tight onto the woman’s arm. Lou pushed her wallet back, waving with a low, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Don’t worry about it. You’ll get me back when we catch up next week?” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She looked up with a thankful smile. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Get that redheaded witch to join us” She added.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio snickered. “She’ll be thrilled. Thanks again, Lou”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Good luck” She pointed. “Take care, Harkness!”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Not with her will I!” Agatha’s body slumped against Rio’s with a little giggle. “Hiiii”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio tried to hold her own grin back, making sure Agatha’s belongings were secure in one hand- Agatha’s physical being locked in the other. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Come on,” She encouraged. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>They stumbled through the bar side by side, but once they got out onto the sidewalk- Agatha almost went face first into the concrete. Rio’s arm lunged out, hooking around her waist and pulling her body right against her own. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha giggled, leaning back into her embrace with a messy, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“My hee- Oh, hero!” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The other woman shook her head, fighting for her life to ignore every warm feeling and swirl of butterflies that started to create a mess of herself. After a few minutes, Rio managed to get Agatha into the passenger seat of her car, thinking about how the roles were exchanged. It wasn’t her in Agatha’s car, but the reverse this time. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><em> And I was sober. </em>She thought to herself.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“What’s your address?” Rio asked as she buckled her in. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“What’d you have in mind?” Agatha rasped, wiggling her eyebrows. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio sighed, leaning an arm on top of the car with her other hand placed firmly on her hip. <br /><br /></p>
  <p>“Get you to bed, that’s-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Ooo! Scandalous” Agatha giggled. “And then what?” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Fucks sake..” Rio muttered. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She shut the car door, walking around the front as she tried to figure out what to do about-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> BEEEEP. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“FUCK!” Rio yelled. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Her hand pressed against her chest, eyes wide as her body trembled with the sudden fear. She looked through the windshield to find Agatha leaned over, hands pressing on the horn with a grin so wide- It threatened to stretch her face apart. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The woman rushed to open her car door, pushing the giddy woman away who whined the second Rio sat in the seat beside her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“You’re no fun!” She pouted.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio caught her breath, pulling the buckle over her torso with a low scoff, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“My apologies..” She muttered. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha was humming some tune, whispering the words about going down a road. Rio didn’t bother to truly listen. Reality was slowly coming to light, realizing she had no other option without knowing where Agatha lived. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>If she called Lilia, Jen, Alice, hell even that William/Billy kid (<em>I really need to figure out his name someday)-  </em>She’d never hear the end of it. And with the fight that had happened between them, would Agatha hate her even more for outting them? </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><em> There’s nothing about us to out! </em>Rio yelled in her mind. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She wouldn’t admit to it, but the other half of reality was something far worse than the others tormenting Rio for saving a drunken Agatha-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> I need to keep her safe.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> What if she hurts herself or gets sick? </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> No- I can’t seriously be debating- </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“So..where we going, <em> my chauffeur?” </em>Agatha asked.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio took in a deep breath, turning the key in the ignition as she nodded to herself with the two words that didn’t feel real, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“My place” She answered.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha gasped. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Scanda-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Lous, yeah. I know” Rio grumbled. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She pulled out of the parking lot, driving down the empty dim lit road with Agatha humming the same tune beside her. Rio hoped it’d stay that way for the rest of the night. By morning, Agatha would most likely take an Uber once she realized where she was. Part of her worried Agatha would kill her for doing this, bringing her to her house intoxicated off her ass. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio made a mental note to ask Lou how much she drank once Agatha was settled on the couch.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I’m sorry for fucking it up..y’know?” Agatha muttered. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio shook her head. “Agatha, you’re drun-”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Ask me this sober!” She exclaimed. “I never wanted to hate you- hate me- hate us- hate hate HATEEE!” She whined. “Okay?! So..”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She stopped at the redlight, taking in a deep breath before looking over to see Agatha’s eyes drooping shut. Her head started to drop, slumber taking over all her words and actions. Part of her was thankful for it, even if getting the woman out of the car may be more difficult. She had silence to collect herself and-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Thud.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio’s body froze, every muscle tensed while her blood flowing through her came to a stop. The frizzy hair tickled her face, the smell of liquor and that familiar vanilla conditioner hit her like a storm. The weight of Agatha’s head rested on her shoulder, but none of it felt as heavy as Rio’s emotions in that moment. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> You hate her.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>It felt so right to have Agatha like this.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> You hate her.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Her giggle was contagious, how she felt warm pressed against her while they stumbled out of the bar together. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> You hate her.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>And the idea of bringing her home? The feeling of keeping her safe? </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> You hate her.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Your shoulder is comfy” Agatha mumbled.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><em> Please remember you hate her. </em>Rio begged herself. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Luckily the remainder of the drive home, Agatha didn’t say anything else. She had fallen asleep on Rio’s shoulder, leaving drool on a small part of her hoodie. The woman wouldn’t notice until she took it off to change into a comfy t-shirt later that night. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Every red light felt far too long, when a car pulled out in front of her- They drove too slow. What felt like hours later did her house finally come into vision. Like a beacon of safety shining for them both. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio pulled into the driveway, not bothering to back in as she normally would. All she wanted was to get Agatha inside, seclude herself in her bedroom and wait for the most terrifying night of her life to be over. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She gently pushed Agatha’s head up, slipping out of the vehicle. This time Rio walked around the back, not trusting Agatha to stay asleep and <em> not </em>lay into the horn this time. Rio would be giving her hell for that move sober or not. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio opened the passenger door, leaning down as she whispered, </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“C’mon..”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha groaned, mumbling how she was tired and didn't want to move. Rio ignored her, lifting the woman by her hips to stand up. However, the younger woman started to fall side to side, front and back until Rio finally accepted-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha walking would be impossible, that was for sure. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Shit. Fine.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio mentally counted down from three before hooking one arm under the woman’s legs, the other supporting her back. She couldn’t refrain the little smile on her lips as Agatha’s giggle blew a warm stream of air against her neck, sending chills down her spine. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“My heroooo” She mumbled. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She sighed, mumbling a low. “Yeah, something like that”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio struggled to unlock the door, but somehow managed to do so and she was thankful for being able to multitask. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Take that, Wanda. Carrying in all the groceries at once pays off.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Nicky greeted them the second she stepped through the threshold. Rio whispered to him to take it easy, not to jump or knock her down while holding Agatha. He was an energetic dog, but luckily listened to Rio well enough to keep his calm. </p>
  <p><br />She maneuvered through the house, careful to not knock Agatha’s legs or head into anything. Nicky stood to the side, tail wagging, eager to sniff the woman up and down as Rio placed her gently on the couch. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“I know..” Rio smiled softly at him. “New person, that’s rare isn’t it?” She whispered. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio never brought anyone home. Only Wanda and Natasha were the two regulars to stop by with the occasional Lilia or Alice. Otherwise, no one ever had access into Rio’s home. She kept the house as her sanctuary safe from the outside world. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha snuggled into the couch more, unfazed by the little sniffles against her arm. Rio moved to take her boots off, gentle to not wake her up. Just as she put them to the side and turned, Nicky was biting onto the fleece blanket and pulling it down from the top of the couch. He draped it over her body, stepping back, giving a proud smile to Rio who’s jaw dropped. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Nicky only ever did that with her. Wanda and Natasha had tried, but he never would budge. The boy had never met Agatha in his entire lifetime and he didn’t hesitate to do something he only ever did for her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Suck up” She whispered, ruffling his hair before pressing a kiss on the top of his head. “Come on, I’ll let you outside before bed” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>He ran off to the kitchen, leaving Rio alone to make sure Agatha was secured. She told herself to remember water and a bucket in case she woke up sick. But what caught her eye was Agatha’s phone on the table. It lit up with the notification of her battery running low. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio hesitated, worried taking it may piss Agatha off more than she possibly would in the morning. But, ultimately Rio took it to plug the device in the kitchen. She had a charger right next to the coffee machine, usually saved for her own. But, Agatha would most likely want to order an Uber before she woke up-n That’d be a good excuse to take it to charge it, no?</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She opened the door on her way by, letting the boy run free. But as he ran, his leg caught her own and she tripped over with Agatha’s phone flying in the air. Nicky didn’t seem phased, not bothering to turn and make sure Rio hadn’t fallen. Rio usually would joke at him for his selfishness, but she was focused on catching Agatha’s phone in the air and realizing-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>It was unlocked. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>At first, Rio re-locked the phone. She didn't think to snoop or do anything else. There was no point in doing such a thing. But what was something Rio thought to do?</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Delete those messages.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She had grabbed a bottle of water, searching for a bowl or bucket to place on the floor by Agatha’s head when the thought abruptly entered her mind. Additional thoughts didn’t waste a second to add themselves on like leeches, ready to suck her dry. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> She’ll hate you even more seeing those.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> She’ll regret it. </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> Would she quit? No. I can’t let her do that.  </em>
  </p>
  <p>
    <em> She can’t leave.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio looked over her shoulder at the phone sitting on the counter. The device was charging, minding it’s own business and furthermore-</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Not my property to do that.. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She shook her head, continuing to open cabinets and walk around the house, searching for the bucket. However with every second, the thought grew stronger- She felt more scared Agatha would actually quit her job and leave out of embarrassment.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> I can’t.. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio found the bucket in her bathroom, tucked in the back of her linen closet. She brought both items into the living room, making sure Agatha was still asleep and breathing. Nicky’s paws broke through the silence, tapping against the floor before he jumped up to snuggle himself onto Agatha’s legs. Rio looked over, a tiny grin tugged on her lips as she faked being offended. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>“Trader” </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She mouthed, leaning down to kiss the top of his head before looking Agatha over one more time. Rio told herself to go to bed, hide in fear for when the woman would sober up and call her a freak, lunatic, every word in the book for bringing her home. Her bedroom would be safe..well, she hoped anyway. </p>
  <p><br />Rio walked through the kitchen, making sure the backyard door was shut and locked. Just as she turned the kitchen light off, Agatha’s phone screen lit up in the darkness with a notification. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> Walk away. Don’t do it.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>She bit the inside of her cheeks, nodding to herself as she stormed off to her bedroom. However, Rio only got to the door when her anxiety pushed her back like a gust of wind stronger than nature itself could ever create. The woman almost tripped over her feet to get back to the phone, looking over her shoulder to make sure Agatha wasn’t behind her. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Opening the Instagram app, Rio told herself she wouldn’t delete them all. Just the ones that Agatha may regret, make sure to tell Rio how disgusting those ideas sounded. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “I think if we matched on Tinder” - Deleted. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Wasting time on you” - Deleted. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Would you be jealous if I fucked her?” - Deleted. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “I’d rather fuck you” - Deleted.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Did you fuck her?” - Deleted. </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> “Why not me?” - Deleted.  </em>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Rio exited the app, locking the screen and placed the phone back down. She stepped away, hand over her mouth while the other gripped the end of her sleeve so hard she threatened to tear through the fabric. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Agatha Harkness, her worst enemy and slowly becoming her worst crush of a lifetime, passed out drunk on her couch. Rio had just violated her phone, deleted messages that now would live in Rio’s mind alone. She’d have to think about them twenty four seven, being the only one between the two to ever know they existed. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Her lips parted, jaw slacked as she felt her eyes stinging with tears filled with fear,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>
    <em> What the fuck did you just do? </em>

  </p>
</blockquote><hr /><p>
  <span>Slowly, Agatha’s eyes started to blink open, adjusting to the sunlight shining rays beside her. She was partially in the shade, feeling the glow against the side of her face. To her left, a water bottle sat on the coffee table with a bucket on the floor beside it. The atmosphere was peaceful, quiet- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Unfamiliar?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Very, very, unfamiliar. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>
      <br />
    </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha felt her fear kick into gear. She pushed herself up, movements frantic as she tried to piece together not only where she was- But, </span>
  <em>
    <span>how </span>
  </em>
  <span>she had ended up there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, Agatha didn’t have long before-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh fuck. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She lunged to her side, pulling the plastic bucket to her with one hand while the other gripped the fleece blanket that covered her. Her stomach flipped upside down, inside out, rejecting the remains of what was in her system from the night before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha hurled, tossed up spews of vomit, felt her body trembling as she struggled to catch her breath. She was distracted by the chaotic few seconds to register the woman behind her. How she gently pulled her hair back, tying it up in a high bun. The way her hands rubbed her upper back, soothing her through the final few spits until her body finally caught itself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She coughed a few more times, cringing at the aftertaste it left on her tongue- desperate to catch her breath. After a few seconds of silence, the bucket was placed back down on the floor- </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s when Agatha jumped at the foreign touch. And even worse? A small raspy chuckle came from behind as her hand disappeared from Agatha’s back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well..good morning to you, drunkie” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Holy fuck. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>No. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio? </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That should tell you how your night went. Bit too much to drink, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned as she stepped around the couch, clicking open the water bottle while she handed it to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was stuck in a trance, lips parted as she still tried to catch her breath from being sick- On top of it now was trying to make sense of Rio standing before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C’mon, take this” Rio wiggled the water bottle in the air. “It’ll hel-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you think you’re doing?” Agatha asked. “Better yet, where the fuck am I? What is-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like I said, you had too much to drink last night” Rio shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stared wide, lips parted as a little scoffed puffed through them.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And so…you took advantage of that and..is this-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes. This is my place” Rio answered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's lips turned into a curl of disgust. </span>
  <em>
    <span>No. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Not a chance in hell was she staying put. She wasn’t staying in Rio’s house or on her couch. There was no way Agatha would stick around Rio any longer. After everything, the last thing she needed was to be near her. That choice would be considered self harm in her eyes.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She snickered, muttering a low. “I’m out of here”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And with a spring board shooting her up in the air, Agatha went to push herself up abruptly to her feet, flying out the door at lightning speed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, that move was abruptly cut short. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha winced as she dropped back onto the couch. She squeezed her eyes shut, head falling into the palm of her hands. Her skull wasn’t just aching. It was full on </span>
  <em>
    <span>screaming</span>
  </em>
  <span> a loud, fierce amount of pain. She felt off balance, room dizzy while her stomach threatened to make her sick all over again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Okay..so maybe running away wasn’t in her deck of cards. But, she sure as shit had it in her to tell Rio off. Even if the hangover was wrecking her entire being, emotional pain and anger ran off their own generator.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re insane..” Agatha snickered, running a hand through her hair before shooting a glare up at her. “Taking advantage of an intoxicated woman. Don’t you know I can’t consent and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh my god” Rio laughed in disbelief.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She closed the water bottle, tossing it into Agatha’s lap, making the woman jump in her seat. Rio crossed her arms against her chest. She pulled her lips back, nibbling on them. But when Agatha’s lips parted to speak again, Rio beat her to it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“For starters, we didn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Don’t get your hopes up”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt her body shiver and it wasn’t from being sick, but because those words sparked something in her mind. She felt the memory flicker in spurts of texting words that included </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Fuck’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>and </span>
  <em>
    <span>‘Rio’ </span>
  </em>
  <span>but couldn’t quite place them. The night before was still fuzzy, not quite clear to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I didn’t tell her I want that..right?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Second- You were fucking wasted, Agatha. I didn’t bring you here to take advantage of you, idiot. I know you hate me and everything, but I am not that kind of disgusting freak”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman subtly nodded. She couldn’t argue with Rio there. Even with her anger and resentment, Rio wasn’t an evil being. A reason Agatha fell hard despite Rio’s continuous hatred for her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was kind, soft. A gentle hearted woman right down to her core. Everyone may give her shit for being stubborn and driven, for living by her work. However, every single person who’d ever landed within a foot of Rio Vidal knew- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s an angel. A stupid, fucking, angel. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, Rio took in Agatha drunk off her ass even after their fight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, Agatha was hungover on her couch with a water bottle in her lap and a bucket of vomit in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Of course, Rio held her hair back and soothed her through getting sick without a blink of an eye. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Of course, she's the one fucking asshole who’d ever take care of me like this. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fucking hell. </span>

</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Third-” Rio held her finger up. “My friend owns the bar you were hanging out at. She called me to tell me you were drunk off your ass”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And, that was a lie.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Too hungover to question how Lou knew Rio and Agatha were co workers, enemies, whatever they were- She just let the explanation slide, not bothering to press on the answer more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instead, her head tipped back as she pinched the bridge of her nose. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gotta’ be kidding me..” Agatha muttered, running a hand through her hair before puffing out a tiny laugh. “You’re insane,” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Insane?” Rio asked. “Some people say </span>
  <em>
    <span>thank you</span>
  </em>
  <span> instead, just a thought”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, looking around to find her phone. She muttered a few curse words, about to snap and ask Rio where it was. Though as if Rio read her mind, she cleared her throat to earn the woman’s attention. Held in the air before her was her phone, followed by the amused grin from the woman holding it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Gimme’ that” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha muttered, reaching up to snatch it from her. However, she missed as Rio held it back with a little, stupid, annoying, giggle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ri-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I even charged your phone for you. Don’t I deserve a thank you somewhere, Ms Harkness?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ms Harkness? That’s new..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Waitingggg” Rio sang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh this woman is-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re really fucking irritating” Agatha said through gritted teeth. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned with a hand over her heart. “Awe! Now you know how I’ve felt for the last three years!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh. I’m fucking sure. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sooo,” Rio waved her phone back and forth as if Agatha was a dog and Rio was holding a bone. “What do we say for taking care of you, charging your phone and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re an asshole”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mm, close!” Rio hummed. “Come on, you can do it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Be a good girl for me</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Be a…be a wha-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio swiped her tongue on the inside of her cheek, slowly licking from bottom to top. She never took her eyes away from Agatha’s, appearing unphased for the two words she dared to say. Agatha on the other hand felt her entire body light on fire. A match was set and placed on a river of gasoline, scorching through her in a matter of seconds. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Was Rio doing this on purpose? Did the fuzzy memory of those texts Agatha sent the night before actually exist? What did Rio know and how the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span> would she survive being trapped until she felt strong enough to leave?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took in a deep breath, muttering a low. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Thank. You.” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman above beamed brighter than the sun. She tossed the phone on Agatha’s lap, smiling wide as she chirped a way too loud for a hangover headache to hear-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re welcome!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cringed, feeling the pulse in her head pound with an ache a bit harder. She thought peacefulness would finally come. THe phone was in her hands, Uber app pulled up to save her from this hell hole. But then, temptation creeped upon her. An offering that sounded far too good to pass up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Want a cup of coffee?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha snickered. “You planning on poisoning me with it?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The offer sounded beautiful and Agatha felt the blissful taste of coffee on her tongue, but..she couldn’t show Rio that excitement. She was already giving her hell left and right as it was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes. “Yes, you caught me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She put her hands up in surrender, feigning theatrics that nearly mirrored the ones Agatha always gave her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Making sure you're safe and taken care of is all a ploy, a con! Just to poison your sorry ass” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed, narrowing her eyes on the woman with an annoyed, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You're enjoying this too much” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned. “Agatha, as long as your hungover ass is on my couch-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She leaned down, a smirk wider than the devil's while her voice deepened into something low. A raspy tone that sent shivers down Agatha’s spine.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm just getting started..” Rio winked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And as if Rio was never in her orbit, far too close to her as she sped through every warning and stop sign- The woman pulled back before Agatha was able to take a breath. She hummed a soft tune while walking away, leaving Agatha to close her eyes and take a heavy sigh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s killing me. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>This hangover won’t be the death of me- Rio will fucking be. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She opened her phone, checking messages first. Only Billy had sent her a few about how his Tinder date was going. The latest update being he left early because the boy made him uncomfortable. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit” Agatha muttered to herself, thumbs tapping across the keyboard. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Usually when dates went bad, Agatha was his savior. She’d show up unannounced without Billy’s request to drag him away. Sometimes she’d fake an emergency, other times she just took him away while the date was in the bathroom. Anytime Billy didn’t feel safe, Agatha would shoot out of bed- Even in her pajamas to get to him. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And this time, she was too busy drinking away every piece of Rio. Well, tried anyway. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sent a small text about how they’d talk soon and to delete the app for now. It wasn’t worth putting himself through date after date when he still had that other boy on his mind. Agatha knew far too well a string of hook ups, useless dates to try and ignore that certain someone made things worse. At least, for her it did. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Just as she hit send, a plastic package smacked against her phone. She jumped, head snapped to the source with a pain that shot like a million bullets. Rio was opening a bottle of pain meds, not paying attention to her as she still hummed that stupid, annoying, tune. Agatha looked down, flipping the package over,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That doesn’t look like coffee” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It was a purple toothbrush, her favorite color. Did Rio do that on purpose? No. Not a chance. Why would she?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, so you like the taste of vomit on your tongue?” Rio asked, snapping her fingers right after. “Right! How could I forget the </span>
  <em>
    <span>delicious </span>
  </em>
  <span>combination of vomit and coffee!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scrunched her nose, hating being reminded of what happened the second she woke up. Rio handed her the two pills of aspirin. Agatha took it without an argument or even a thank you. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bathroom is the first door on the left, can’t miss it” Rio directed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She leaned down to grab the bucket and this time, Agatha wasn’t arguing in a malicious or annoyed way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, no- I’ve got that, Rio. Seriously, I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shut it” Rio ordered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Embarrassment wasn’t only covering Agatha’s tone, but she physically felt it taking over the hangover’s pain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>From passing out drunk on her enemy’s couch, waking up sick and hungover in the same spot- And now Rio, the woman who was her enemy and someone she couldn’t stop falling in love with cleaning up her vomit..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Toothpaste is on the sink” Rio said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She paused with the bucket held in her hand by her side as Agatha’s cheeks tainted a deep shade of red. The way she looked down, fiddling with the toothbrush packet in her hands. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha..” Rio softened, offering a tiny smile. “I clean up dog shit and vomit. I really won’t blink an eye over this. Besides, don’t need you getting sick from cleaning up your own vomit”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha puffed out a small laugh. One that was weak and filled with defeat. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“C’mon now,” Rio kicked her foot out, softly tapping it against Agatha’s leg. “Go brush your teeth, splash some water on your face. It’ll help”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio continued to hum as she walked away, leaving Agatha to debate getting up or to stay put. Ultimately, the aftertaste of sour, bitter, with leftover whiskey (Or, she was probably just imagining that) won. She pushed to her feet to patter down the hall. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bathroom was easy to find as Rio told her it would be. She shut the door behind her, giving herself the privacy to use the toilet and wash up. Her bladder was emptied, teeth brushed, face soaked in cold water and dried off- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Shit. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha caught herself staring at her own reflection. Pale skin, darkened eyes with heavy bags underneath. Her hair was a wreck, clothes wrinkled and worn out. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha </span>
  </em>
  <span>was worn out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Is this rock bottom? </span>
  </em>
  <span>She wondered.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha wasn’t an alcoholic, but she was self destructive. After the first week of silence and barely ever seeing Rio, the fight they had in the parking lot- She felt herself slowly losing every glue, every thread, all the bricks that kept her wall together being destroyed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How can I be heartbroken over someone that was never mine to begin with?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She asked herself that question every now and then, but now it was more than ever. Like clockwork, intuition on the other woman’s part as if she knew Agatha was starting to think of her- Two knocks on the bathroom door snapped her back into reality. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha cleared her throat, rolling her shoulders back as she hung the hand towel back up.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What do you want?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I have a set of more comfortable clothes if you want” Rio offered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The one word started to scream in her mind. Had Rio lost it or was this some wicked vivid dream? Their fight on Friday was brutal, Rio made it clear she wished things would have been different. She said the words that made Agatha freeze and cry driving home that night. How she thought them never talking, meeting, should have been the way everything was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>So why the hell was she being nice all of the sudden?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha reached out, ripping the door open with a rough,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are you doing this?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s mouth had moved to say something, but shut as Agatha took the floor instead. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stood with a neatly folded set of clothes in her arms. What looked like a black hoodie, green sweatpants underneath. Agatha knew deep down they didn’t look comfortable solely because she was exhausted, hungover, and her clothes from the night before felt disgusting. Reality was, they were Rio’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The thought of not only being in Rio’s home, on her couch, staying the night even if the memory of it was fuzzy- But to add on wearing her clothes? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m signing my death certificate if I agree to this. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged. “I hate hangovers” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stared, eyes squinted for a few seconds before a tiny scoff,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay? We all do, so why are you-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio muttered something incoherent under her breath. A few words not spoken in English. Agatha only heard her speak Spanish a few times over the three years of knowing her, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck. </span>
  </em>
  <span>She’d be lying if she said it didn’t make Rio hotter than she already was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What was that?” Agatha asked, trying her best to stay angry and cold. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed. “Just…take these, alright?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio..” Agatha laughed. “Answer the fucking question”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are you questioning someone helping you? Huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Because said person just wished we never spoke or met in the first place” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. “First part, yes. But I never said that about us ever meeting-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh!” Agatha nodded. “Right. K’, that makes it so much better” She rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman’s head looked away, fiddling with the fabric of her hoodie. She started to teeter side to side, rocking on her feet while sticking her tongue in cheek. Agatha felt her own aggressive demeanor weaken. She’d blame the hangover before ever admitting taking pity on Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sighed, running a hand through her hair. “I’m just confused”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed with a nod. “Ditto”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What is that supposed to mean?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked up, staring for a few lingering moments. Agatha knew they were close. The woman felt it in her bones they were stepping towards an answer, a line that she never thought would be crossed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But then, like a buzzer that declined what Agatha ever wanted- The coffee maker beeped in the kitchen. Both of them jumped subtly in their spot, Rio’s head whipped over before back at Agatha. She nervously chuckled, shoving the clothes against Agatha’s chest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So uh, how do you take your coffee? You know what! You always choose my order against my will so…payback for that. K’, cool. Uh, just- I’ll be- Head to the living room after if you want”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And as if Rio was never there, she rushed down the hall and disappeared back in the kitchen. She left Agatha holding onto the clothes, staring wide as she muttered under her breath, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I like my coffee with answers..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stepped back, shutting the door while placing the clothes on the edge of the sink. Her phone lit up, distracting her for just a few seconds. It was Billy sending a meme of a sad gif. Some kid walking before falling face first. She scoffed, quickly shooting back how the boy he adored was missing out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though before putting her phone back down, she opened Instagram to check the reels Alice had sent her. Yet…that never happened. Her heart sank, finding Rio’s last message being a simple,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Agatha?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tapped the screen, feeling sick with anxiety as she saw her own messages one after the other. She scrolled up through them, quickly noticing how Rio lied to her moments prior. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Lou never called Rio. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t know they knew each other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio not only was searching for her, but Agatha had texted her drunk off her ass. Agatha wasn’t sure which one was worse. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wait..” She whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Don’t tele” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She nibbled on her bottom lip. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t tell who..what? </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The one above that caught her eye was even more confusing. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m sorry I should nt say”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shouldn’t say what?” She asked herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first half of the messages were in order and made sense. However the second half?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Something is off…</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt the fuzzy memories of drunken messages hit her. The ones Agatha had been questioning their existence or not. And like a punch, an explosion-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh fuck” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They all registered in her mind, beeping with a scanner each time they appeared. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I think if we matched on Tinder” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Wasting time on you” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Would you be jealous if I fucked her?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’d rather fuck you” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Did you fuck her?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Why not me?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha dropped her phone on top of the clothes. She pressed the back of her hand over her mouth, the other gripping her hip with such force she threatened to crush the bone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Those messages were real. Their placements lined up the drunken mess of texts perfectly. Puzzle pieces scattered that slotted into their spots in order. Agatha had sent the most damning texts of her lifetime. Ones she’d regret for eternity. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But, she deleted them. How on earth did she delete those? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For starters, Agatha knew herself well enough to know when she was too far gone. Drunk texting the enemy you hopelessly had fallen for was a clear enough sign. Not remembering exactly how she ended up on Rio’s couch? Another. Both of them told her over and over the same thing.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I couldn’t have deleted these..</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>There’s no way I was drunk texting her and remembering to delete them.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, hand running through the tangled mess of hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How..” She muttered. “I-”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I even charged your phone for you. Don’t I deserve a thank you somewhere, Ms Harkness?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s voice echoed in her mind. Agatha thought those words over, thinking about how she kept her phone unlocked right after. Billy always said that was a poor decision, but she never cared. No one was ever around to have a reason to take her phone. If some criminal who stole her shit wanted to, he wouldn’t find anything interesting either in her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She deleted them..she-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha started to nervously laugh under her breath. She paced back and forth in the tiny bathroom, tugging at the roots of her hair- threatening to yank them out of her skull. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay, two reasons..one could be true and the other night” She whispered to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t uncommon for Agatha to ramble on to herself. Sometimes her thoughts were too loud to keep locked in her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“She either hates you texted those or thought I was lying. Drunk off my ass, yeah. That…that could be, but, but, but oh- Shit, shit” She cursed to herself, leaning back as she smacked her thigh a few times. “There’s no way she’d take care of me- Not-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shook her head, voice cutting off as two words rang in her mind,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Good girl”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was flirting” She muttered to herself, but then shook her head. “No” She scoffed with a pathetic laugh. “She wouldn’t…but she never has talked to me like that before. She never-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>This was a mess. One giant fucking mess Agatha had no idea where to find the cleaning supplies for. At the rate they were going, bleach and a mop didn’t exist. Agatha knew she was being left to her own devices to clean this up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked back at the clothes, feeling her flannel and jeans far too tight. Agatha was already suffocating in fear and adrenaline, confusion piling on top of everything else. For a split moment, she debated getting an Uber and the hell out of here but…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Good girl. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That was a clear indication of flirting. Agatha may live in a state of denial at times, but she knew the meaning of what was said. And the fact Rio had never spoken to her like that before? If those texts were real (Which Agatha was 110% they were) and all of the sudden, Rio was using those words? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She thought as well how minutes ago, Rio almost said something- Gave her just a hint of an answer, but that stupid fucking coffee maker took it away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck it. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha wasn’t going to run from this. What more damage could staying possibly do? She was already drowning, sinking past the ocean floor over every little thing about Rio. Rio on the other hand would easily slip back into hating her and would expect another weekend to be forgotten. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stripped her clothes, folding them into a pile before pulling on the set Rio gave her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The pants were soft, comfortable and fit perfectly. No issue there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The hoodie? There was one major issue and it most certainly was not how it fit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck..” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The smell of Rio swallowed her, stole her, took her in like she was its next victim. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She always loved the cologne that could only be described as an apple, woodsy smell. But her clothes? Agatha never knew how comforting, addictive, better than that stupid cologne it could smell. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The soft laundry detergent laced with an earthy, sweet, grounding fragrance that instantly calmed the storm raging inside of her. She lowered her head, gripped the edge of the sink to catch her breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>

    <span>God, I hate her..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn’t, she really fucking didn’t. What Agatha hated was even with the pain Rio inflicted on her, how the last three years had been an endless hell- The stupid smell of her clothes could ease every inch of the adrenaline in her. How being in her home was comforting even through the urge to run at any given moment. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And she hated her for deleting those texts and not knowing why. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked back up in the mirror, taking in a deep breath and mentally counting down to get back out there. The smell of coffee lingering through the door helped with the motivation to do so.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Five. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Just gotta’ figure out what the motive was for that. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Four. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Also why the hell she’s taking care of me.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Three. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Worst comes to worse, I just quit my job and leave the country. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Two. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She already hates me, fuck it. I can’t make it worse than it already is. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>One. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>
      <br />
    </span>
  </em>
  <em>
    <span>Showtime. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pushed herself back up, grabbing her clothes off the sink before leaving the room. She nearly stormed down the hall, stomping with determination in every step. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Just as she entered the living room, Rio was sitting on the other end of the couch with the coffee mug in her hand. She looked up, offering it to her as she spoke,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Alright, coffee for-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Liar!” Agatha exclaimed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Great start. Maybe should’ve planned this out more. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio paused, eyebrows furrowed over the word.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh,” She looked in the mug, shaking her head. “Nope. Definitely coffee” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“If your friend called you..” Agatha held her phone up with a low smile. “Why did you interrogate me on my whereabouts?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s cheeks burned, shading a deep flush that Agatha swore she felt the heat radiating off of from across the room. She looked down, leaning forward to rest the coffee on the table. It was clear Agatha had caught her in a lie and Rio knew it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Now..this is fun. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha thought to herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, I was going to question how Lou knew we were…what? Co workers? Enemies? Besties-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio sighed, rolling her eyes as she sat back. She folded her arms against her chest, clearly unamused by Agatha’s words. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“But when I opened these messages- It all clicked!” Agatha grinned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know, you are far too giddy for the one who drunk texted me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but!” Agatha held her finger up, taking slow steps over to the couch. “I did not lie about how you found me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And deleted those messages, but…we’ll get to that. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio watched her every move carefully, evidently more nervous by the second. With every word, every step- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do you want the stupid coffee or not?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oo, feisty” Agatha smirked. “What? Don’t like being caught in a lie?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I was just trying to make you feel better. Save your ego from feeling the damage of drunk texting me” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh honey..” Agatha rasped with a small grin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She leaned down to pick the coffee mug up, her body just a few inches away from Rio’s. Agatha mirrored the scene Rio had given her prior. Where she had leaned over her, saying how she was just getting started before rushing away as if she was never there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Could that be classified as flirting too? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha wondered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her head turned, lips curled into a dangerous smile that made Rio sink into the couch a bit more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You came running to my rescue. Think your ego is taking a stronger hit over mine”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha swiftly pulled away, dropping on the other end of the couch with a proud grin. One full of herself that earned a glare from the other woman. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took a sip of the coffee, about to boast about how Rio making her the cup was another thing to ruin her ego. However, the taste silenced her and not in a bad way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The coffee wasn’t just good, no…it was, </span>
  <em>
    <span>perfect. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Better than Agatha made it for herself or any barista she went to. She took another sip, and then another, about to find the strength to tease Rio again. The little snicker on her left beat her to it.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So? Did I guess your order right?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed the liquid with a shake of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Two spoonfuls of sugar, bit of milk and a little bit of caramel,” Rio listed the recipe off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s right. God dammit.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed. “Your ego should feel damaged knowing that”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Interesting way of saying I’m right” Rio smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, letting the silence linger for a bit. Rio had pulled her phone out as Agatha studied the plants around the room. All bright green, names she didn’t know- Only described as plants or </span>
  <em>
    <span>creatures </span>
  </em>
  <span>in Rio’s world. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She knew she should press more on why Rio lied, but those deleted drunk text messages started to shove their way to the forefront of everything else. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Part two, get a move on. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha encouraged herself to continue on while she could. Courage was always something Agatha could easily lose. She knew she had to get a move on, take advantage of it before the feeling was stripped away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I feel like I texted you about other things…did I?” She blurted.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Out of the corner of her eye, Rio was frozen. Her thumbs that had been texting on her screen had come to a stop. She didn’t look up, not a word or movement. The woman was at a complete stand still, a statue with a title, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I deleted them. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha slowly nodded, taking another sip from her coffee. Two options were in front of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Option A - Let Rio lie her way out of this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>Or, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Option B - Call her out on it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nope” Rio lied, popping the p as she pushed back into being nonchalant. No more fear or embarrassment like before. “Just drunken messages about how drunk you were, all that jazz”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Jazz? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha laughed in her mind. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Jesus, you’re a terrible liar. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm” Agatha hummed. “Well-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before she was able to continue on, Agatha felt a wave of nausea crash like ocean waves over her. She winced, leaning forward to rest the coffee mug on the table and pull her knees up to her chest. Her eyes shut, hands covering her face as she tried to ride it out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stomach again?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha couldn't be bothered with sarcasm at that moment. Instead she muttered a low, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nauseous” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio locked her phone, placing it down on the table not far from Agatha’s phone. Her body shifted a bit, elbows resting on her knees as her fingers picked the skin off her thumbnail. She bounced her knee, clearly stuck in a small debate, a battle in her mind. If Agatha didn’t feel so sick, wasn’t focused on coming down from the feeling- She’d make fun of her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wanna’ smoke?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The question caught Agatha off guard stronger than waking up in Rio’s house did. She looked up, finding a tiny smirk shining bright her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It helps..” Rio shrugged. “I have some light shit. Not strong enough to get you super stoned, but…it’ll ease your stomach” Rio explained, but then snapped her fingers with a fast “Oh! But side effects may include wanting to order food” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha tried to not smile. She really, </span>
  <em>
    <span>really, </span>
  </em>
  <span>fucking tried. But, the little smirk, snap of her fingers with the tiny side effect she included. God. She hated how stupid Rio’s cuteness was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A little grin escaped from the restraints. She whispered a low, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I never argue free weed” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who said it’s free?” Rio questioned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s smile faded, embarrassment control all over again. She sounded selfish, ashamed of thinking Rio would just smoke her up for free after being such a bitch since she opened her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stood up, a warm grin took over the smirk as she pointed,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your payment will be ordering us food”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt her body relax into the couch, she took a small breath, letting go of the shame that was threatening to control her. Slowly, she nodded. A little shrug as she rasped a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That can be arranged”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nodded. “We have a deal then?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Stop stalling and medicate me” Agatha ordered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bossy” Rio held her hands up as she walked away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She picked her phone back up, opening Facebook to scroll through the mess of those posts. Old memes, people in their town group complaining about different neighbors (Agatha did enjoy those the most), but it only kept her mind busy for a few moments. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The giant elephant in her brain grew larger and stronger, spelling out the words, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We won’t be sober. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha blew out a quick stream of air from her nostrils. She put her phone down, pinching the bridge of her nose.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I really should just leave. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>We didn’t even get to finish- Did we even talk? Why aren’t we finishing anything?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio wouldn’t answer her question from before. Agatha had caught her in two lies, but nothing was completed or sorted from that. And now they were just going to smoke as if nothing ever happened? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I gotta’ get out of-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oof!” Agatha yelled out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked down to the heavy weight that had assaulted her. A wide grin, bad breath, tail wagging back and forth in the air. Agatha knew Rio had a dog, everyone did. But, she had yet to truly meet him until he was right on the couch in her face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt her worries wash away. Every thought about fleeing disappeared. She reached up, holding both sides of his face as she scratched his ears.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, hi there” She grinned. “Aren’t you a cutie?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Completely forgetting where she was, too focused on the dog trying to lick her nose while smiling like a lunatic- Agatha didn’t hear Rio rush back into the living room.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit, I'm sorry. I'm so used to leaving the back door open for him to run in and out. He's-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“A demon!” Agatha grinned, voice muffled against his fur. “A cute one though, I'd argue” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pressed her forehead against Nicky’s head. She started to speak in a baby voice about how good of a boy he was, how cute and soft his fur was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Rio never knew she could feel so doomed seeing someone with her dog before.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio's heart stopped at the sight. Agatha sitting up on the couch with her legs tucked under her. Nicky in her lap, both in their own world. How the normally shy puppy’s tail was wagging so fast she wondered if he’d start to float in the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It almost felt normal, as if the scene was something that fit their narrative. A story the two were meant to write, a movie they should be in, a life they were meant to live instead of the confusing one they kept on going with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Almost makes up for dealing with your wicked, horrible, insufferable mother” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, but was thankful Agatha pulled her away from the spot she was stuck in. She sat down on the other end of the couch, opening the small tin case filled with fresh tiny joints. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Run along” Rio reached over to tap Nicky’s leg. “You can come suffocate her after we smoke”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed, kissing the top of his head before sending him off. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Such a responsible dog mom, you are” She said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>Rio snickered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What?” She asked, placing the joint between her lips. “Think my cruelness extends to my son?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha turned in her spot, elbow rested on the back of the couch with her hand tangled in her hair. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh god, you’re that kind of person?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched as Rio flicked the lighter, bringing the flame to the tip. A stream of smoke clouded around it. The woman laughed, coughing a bit as she choked on the smoke. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You just called me a dog mom” Rio said, passing her the joint. “Hypocrite”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha rolled her eyes, eagerly taking the joint and was quick to take not just a hit- But, a deep one. A long drag that she didn’t know she needed so bad. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio moved to grab her phone as Agatha smoked. She pulled up a playlist on Spotify, connecting it to the speakers by the TV. The first song, Dreams by The Cranberries, left Rio thankful it wasn’t anything that could relate to them (Well…so she thought). </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“How do you know Lou?” Agatha asked, passing the joint back over to Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“College,” Rio shrugged. “You a regular for her?” She smirked a bit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sneered, scrunched nose with a little shake of her head as she mocked, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You a regular for her? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Fuck off, Vidal” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, taking a slow drag before passing it back to Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“An old fling..” Agatha shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That was a lie. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha partially blamed the weed even if she didn’t feel its effects quite yet. She wasn’t going to continue on with edging every conversation they had so far. If Agatha was going to sit here smoking with Rio, listening to music and spending time with her all over again- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She was going to get all the answers before having to act as if this never happened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jealous?” Agatha dared to ask. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, but it didn’t sound like one with humor. It sounded like a defense. A coping mechanism that was protecting the truth behind it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Totally” She took a deep inhale of the smoke before passing it back. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took the joint from her fingers, taking a hit as she replied with a small,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What’s hm?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha held the smoke in her lungs as she shook her head. “Not buying it” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed. “Good. I’m not selling anything for you to buy”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What a shame” Agatha sighed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The joint was passed a few more times. Only the music filled the silence, neither dared to say another word. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, the weed started to kick in. Little giggling slipped their lips as Rio stammered,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I uh..” She put the joint in the ashtray before leaning back. Her arms threw back above her head and over the back of the couch. A little laugh as she shook her head. “Fuck”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed, a little snort cutting through. She swore the sound that she felt embarrassed over for years, but grew to love made Rio smile harder. But, that was most likely just the weed talking. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You what?” She asked, smiling wider by the second. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was about to say something, Agatha swore it. But she just shook her head with a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Getting hungry. Side effect kicking in”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha wanted to argue that those weren't the original words, but…she was growing hungry too. Her hand grabbed her phone, both giggling as she nearly dropped it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What are you thinking?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You” Rio answered as if it was obvious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked up, finding Rio quickly clearing her throat with a shake of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You uh, you decide..” </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s thinking about..me? Is that what she meant? No..no. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Pancakes sound good” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I would make us those, but..I’m- Yeah, I’m stoned” Rio giggled.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I don’t trust your cooking anyway”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped, a hand over her heart as she made the loudest face of offense. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’ve never even tried!” She exclaimed. “That’s so cruel, Harkness. Such a cruel, </span>
  <em>
    <span>cruel, </span>
  </em>
  <span>woman”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled up Doordash on her phone as she laughed harder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Guess you’ll have to cook me dinner sometime” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She said the words without thinking. Once again, she would blame it on weed over ever accepting the truth. What she’d also chalk up to the weed?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hm. Noted” Rio shrugged, holding her hand out. “Gimme’ I wanna’ order my foooood” She sang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled up the restaurant’s location, handing it over to her as she echoed the word Rio had earlier. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bossy” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>__</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The TV played an episode of Law and Order as they were slouched on the couch, shoulders nearly brushing against one another. The foam containers rustled in their hands, forks stabbing the pancakes as they ate like they never had food before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“The uncle did it” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, a mouthful of food as she replied,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No! It was the boyfriend!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not a chance”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And what makes you an expert on murder cases? Huh?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha grinned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I am one, ever think of that?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes. “So murder me then. Get me away from you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Honey, you’re the one nearly leaning against me”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As soon as she said it, Agatha wished she had kept her mouth shut. Rio pulled away as if she electrocuted her. She shifted to the arm of the couch, putting distance between them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Idiot..</span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha thought to herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The show continued on, the ending felt as if it’d never come. Agatha was trying to wait till the episode was over to say something, figure out a way to continue the conversation from before. However, she knew her high was going away with every bite she took. Eating always stripped her of the blissfulness of being stoned, but hey- Food tasted so much better that way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Maybe it was the fact she was still stoned or maybe since the other conversations hadn’t been finished, Agatha wanted to dive into a new one. Maybe then they could complete it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She took another bite, chewing and swallowing before taking a deep breath in, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I was an asshole Friday..” She said. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The container of Rio’s food came to a silence. She was in the middle of taking a bite when her fork froze in the air, mouth stayed open ajar before slowly closing. The woman started to stab her food, clearly losing her appetite. Agatha worried for a moment she wasn’t going to say anything, but luckily…she was wrong. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I told you to forget that weekend happened. You did” Rio cut her off with a shrug. “You aren’t an asshole for that” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked down at her food, surprised Rio faced the decision she had made. She wasn’t sure if Rio would ever own up to being the one to force what happened the last week. If she never kept pushing Agatha to forget that weekend ever happened, she wouldn’t have spent days ignoring her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Now the coffee thing? Yeah, okay. Dick move, Harkness. I was looking forward to my evening drink” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman froze, slowly looking up with a smirk. One filled with surprise. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry, did Professor Vidal who’s always told me to shove that coffee up my ass or told everyone she threw it out…did you just admit to-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You’re hungover and partially stoned,” Rio argued. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sober enough to catch you in a lie, honey” Agatha grinned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their attention returned to the episode- Well, Rio did. Agatha thought that anyway, but..she was too busy thinking to herself how that felt completed. It wasn’t a long, drawn out, hours filled conversation. But, it wasn’t an argument either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha couldn’t quite figure out the words for how the conversation felt, but it wasn’t bad…that was for sure.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So..no comment on my pancakes?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked away from the TV. She knew Rio had ordered double chocolate chip, but looked at the mess of pancakes to confirm it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>She slowly smirked. “What? About how boring you are?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Double chocolate pancakes are the all time greatest!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“They’re boringggg” Agatha drew the word out with a roll of her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Says the one who got what?” Rio leaned over, shoulder nearly brushing against Agatha’s once again. “Strawberry shortcake- Fuck! That’s so gay”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pulled back away and Agatha hated everything all over again, but…she kept up with the conversation. Making sure to not show her energy draining slowly. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Right, right,” Agatha chuckled. “Because I made it ever so clear I am in fact straight”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged, voice softening as she replied, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fine. Well, to be fair..I’ve never had strawberry shortcake so-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed, a tiny snort laced through again. Rio’s reaction of becoming flustered happened all over again as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So quick to judge something you’ve never had” Agatha shook her head. “Disgraceful, Vidal. Such a disgrace..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The next move was nothing but the weed. Agatha felt out of control. There were invisible strings pulling her limbs as if she were a puppet, being dictated by a stronger being above. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stabbed a piece of her pancake, holding up the fork as she leaned her body over just a few inches. Rio was taking a bite when she looked up, words muffled with the chocolate pancake piece in her mouth,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wot’ are you doin’?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman rolled her eyes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What does it look like?” Agatha asked, wiggling the fork in the air. “Do I need to make airplane noises for you to understand?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She watched as Rio swallowed the piece of her own pancake. Her eyes were wide, flickering with the same fear that matched Agatha’s. The unknown, how butterflies swirled around them, limbs and skin vibrating with desire to find something more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a moment, Agatha could see it. She saw how they both felt the same thing, but then again..maybe it was the weed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio took in a deep breath before leaning forward, lips wrapped around the fork as she slid the soft pink pancake off. The woman leaned back, chewing slowly while fiddling with her own fork more and more. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tastes gay, but..” Rio shrugged, looking back up at her. “That could just be the source it was coming from” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh shit. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Why…why did I encour-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Maybe you should check the source..just to be sure” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Holy fuck. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Okay. So, maybe the weed wasn’t the best idea to agree to. Agatha flirted with Rio endlessly for three years, but never this. This was uncharted territory. They stepped over a line, through a door that slammed shut from behind. There was no turning back. She felt the change in the air, a switch was flipped-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What did I just do?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cleared her throat, visibly uncomfortable- Well, so Agatha thought. She wasn’t uncomfortable in a bad way. The woman was feeling nervous beyond words. Not even weed or xanax would be able to settle her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sources say said source will say I took advan-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Source has been shamelessly flirting with you for years, idiot” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>K’. No restraints anymore. Awesome. Cool. Maybe shut up while you’re ahead?! </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You flirt with everyone,” Rio pointed out.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed. “Not the way I flirt with you. Thought you were smart enough to figure that out” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman let go of her fork, reaching forward to place the container on the table. She started to find her shoes and wallet, figuring if she was about to run out the door- It wouldn’t hurt to throw words that were sure to lock her in hell for eternity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Plus, those deleted texts of mine should’ve told you too” Agatha tossed over her shoulder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her heart drop, Agatha nearly heart the organ hit the floor. When she had ahold of her boots, she glanced over to see the brown eyes bulging her way. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed. “Yeah. Knew you deleted them-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Wha-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t play dumb with me, Rio!” Agatha snapped. “My phone isn’t locked. Hasn’t been in awhile. You took it to charge it, and magically those messages are gone?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I..I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What? Were you disgusted by them? Is that it?” Agatha questioned, not letting up for a second. “You didn’t have to delete them. Jesus. That’s a bit over the line, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>Rio reached forward to put her food down, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On the other side of the couch, Rio was locked in a deep state of fear. She felt as if she was watching helplessly, unable to find words or lunge forward to hold Agatha back. The moment felt surreal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s...those texts weren’t-</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Is she saying she wants me? Did she mean-</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know you hate me, but this is fucking low” Agatha muttered, tying her one boot up. “You could have just said to me you don’t view me the same. Like. My god, deleting them and then taking care of me like this. It’s all so-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, okay, fine..” Rio sighed. “You’re..right about how I fucking hate you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh, that’s smart. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha looked back over with a flicker of pain. Her eyes narrowed, stinging with the threat of tears as she spat a clipped, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you, Rio”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, exactly” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Shit. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio puffed out a weak, nervous laugh. She swallowed the nervous lump in her throat. Her mind had been screaming, begging for her to do something. She just didn’t expect those two words or the following to be the answer. The route she was choosing to take was on a whim with no map to follow.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck it. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s why I fucking hate you because that’s what I can’t stop..wanting you to do”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was in the middle of standing up, grabbing her things when the words hit her ears. She froze, movements coming to a stop, but her head slowly turned to find Rio leaning her palms on the couch. Her body was towards her, eyes looking up with a doe filled stare mixed with plea. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“To me” Rio adds on like an idiot. “Which..yeah, that was probably clear. I don’t- I didn’t have to clarify that”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha didn’t know what to say let alone do. She couldn’t move, tried to tell herself this was all just a really extreme high or maybe a nightmare that had trapped her for life. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, as Rio kept talking…Agatha realized this was all real. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I deleted those texts because I thought you’d regret it…maybe you still will if this is all just the weed talking” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio nervously laughed, taking a breath as she shook her head. “But, </span>
  <em>
    <span>shit..</span>
  </em>
  <span>I can’t stop thinking about them” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Stupid fucking weed. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Why did she even suggest smoking? Rio was smart enough to know weed stripped her of a filter, sent her on nonstop rambles with no barriers to stop her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I fucking hate you because I can’t stop thinking about..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She holds her breath, desperate to stop herself. Yet..she was too far gone. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You” Rio exhaled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The silence and staring lasted so long, you’d think they were having a staring contest. When in reality, both were stunned. Neither knew how they got here, it couldn’t be explained. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>On Agatha’s end, she had thought about running and silently cursed how no conversation was finished. Only one felt somewhat secure by the end of it. And now here they were, thrown into confessions and words she never thought they’d hear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And on Rio’s side of things? All she could explain it would be just a little,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Lol. What did I do?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>She’d ask herself after Agatha inevitably left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio didn't know what else to say. She stared up at Agatha who’s shoes were on, belongings in her hands, close to ordering an Uber or just walking home- Both sounded horrible. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I-” Rio stuttered, unable to find words. “Just-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio..” Agatha shook her head. “I’m tired. Okay? What are you saying? Just tell me, straight up- Do you want me to stay or go?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stared up, feeling her entire body pulse with desire. The answer was clear, but she was unsure if she’d be able to finally say the truth or not. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She opened her mouth to take in a breath before whispering the first word till the others followed suit,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Agatha..”</span>
  </em>

    <span>“I just don’t think she’s meant for me, y’know?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio’s head rested on Wanda’s shoulder. The whiskey now in full control, water barely helping flush it out of her system. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“What do you mean?” Wanda asked. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She sighed, feeling her eyes sting just a hint, tears threatening their arrival.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Agatha?” Wanda questioned her further. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio weakly nodded, but regretted it as the room spun hard. She groaned, turning her head to hide her face against Wanda’s shirt. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I think you’re wrong” She said, lifting a hand to push hair out of Rio’s face. “I don’t think you’d be this much of a drunken mess if she wasn’t meant to be more than just a woman you pretend to hate” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I’m not pretendin’ to hate ‘er” Rio lied. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wanda huffed, a weak smile as she tried to settle the mess beside her. It was rare for Rio to be so completely vulnerable. If she were sober, she’d be stretched across the room- putting more than an arms length between the two. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The woman knew it wasn’t just the alcohol that shoved her down, completely wrecking her from head to toe. If Agatha was a woman she hated, if Agatha wasn’t something more in Rio’s eyes- She’d be a fun drunk making jokes and tossing insults behind Agatha’s back. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Instead, she was down for the count- spewing lies across her drunken tongue. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Hate her, huh?” Wanda asked. “Sure looks like it” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio weakly nodded. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Mhm” She hummed. “She’s a stupid fuckin’ stupid bitch-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“I know you are,” Wanda snickered. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“What?” Rio lifted her head, eyes half open as her lips were stuck apart. “I’m not-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“You are a stupid fuckin’ stupid bitch” Wanda recited. “With love, of course, but..look at you” She gestured. “She’s ignored you for not even a full week and you’re half a bottle of whiskey in-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“This is celebratory! Best week of my life!” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Jesus,” Wanda rolled her eyes. “When will you just accept you lost, Rio? You don’t hate her. You never truly have. She intimidates the hell out of you because you’re clearly out of control and-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“What?!” Rio yelled, sitting up and away from her. “You suddenly a know it all now?!” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“When it comes to you, yes!” Wanda laughed.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She shook her head, arms folded against her chest while giving Rio the strongest glare of disbelief. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Rio. You’re drunk. I know you may forget or feel this is just some fuzzy memory, ƒƒbut get over yourself. Do something. All you’re doing is hurting yourself more and more by keeping this charade going” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The woman looked down, picking the skin off her thumb while chewing the inside of her cheek. Even in a drunk state of mind, she knew Wanda was more than right. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Maybe she would forget this conversation by the next morning, but what would remain was the hatred for Agatha Harkness being nothing more than a con. A scam that wasn’t running as well as it used to.  </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“And what if I’m wrong?” Rio asked. “Then what?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Wrong about what? Her feeling the same?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio nodded. She appeared to be a small kid, scared of being in trouble or not being liked by a friend anymore. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Honey..” Wanda softly smiled. “I’ve never steered you wrong on anything. Plus, she wouldn’t go that length to ignore you let alone spend the weekend with you..don’t you think?” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Rio laughed. “I don’t know what to think these days..”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wanda nodded. “Then don’t think. Just do”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>The woman furrowed her eyebrows, head tilted as she recited the words in a questioning tone.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Don’t think, just do?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Mhm” Wanda hummed. “Don’t think. Just do” She echoed. </span>
  </em>
</p><hr /><p>
  <span>“Don’t think, just do..” Rio muttered under her breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What did you just say?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She looked back up, the memory stuck in a haze disintegrating from her. Abruptly, Rio had been kicked back into the present. Instantly remembering the word that landed her there.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Agatha. </span>
  </em>
  <span>She had said barely a few moments prior. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The name was heavy, weighed and felt stronger on her tongue than ever before. Rio wasn’t saying the name casually. No annoyance, state of vexation. Hesitation still remained, but there was a charge surging through it, forcing Rio to go in a direction she never dared to venture off to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled her lips back, nibbling on them as her fingers grasped the texture of the couch. She felt her body start to shiver. If she were to stand, her feet would break as the world felt off balance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Say something. Anything. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know how uh, I tell you to fuck off?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wrong thing, dumbass..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed, shaking her head. “Got it..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman walked off, leaving Rio to jump up in a panic as she called out, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit, shit- Agatha!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She threw a laugh back at her, not giving a moment to let Rio explain. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio, you're referencing your trademark. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck off, Harkness? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Yeah. Message taken, point clear. I'll be seeing myself out”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>For a woman stoned and hungover, she moved fast when she wanted to. However, Rio was right behind her. Running, jumping around the corners, lunging across the entry way- Agatha had pulled the front door open, Rio’s arm extended as her palm smacked with a stinging sensation to slam it shut. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio, I swear to God. Get the hell away from me or I’ll-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She turned on her heel, trying to ignore how close Rio was- The way her arm brushed against her shoulder. Agatha tried to shove her back, escape as if Rio was threatening to kidnap her. Though the way Rio stared, her breath had a panicked pattern…</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Is she holding me back to stay?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suddenly, the atmosphere between them felt different. Throughout the day, it had swayed like a boat in the ocean. Swinging left to right, crashing upon the waves. Though, this didn’t compare. There were no words, metaphors, explanations to describe what the air had turned into. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha swallowed, avoiding Rio’s eyes pouring into her own. It was for her own good. She needed to get out, run away to safety.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Let me go..” She muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, not hesitating to exhale a desperate, “No” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Now what? </span>
  </em>
  <span>Both asked themselves in their own minds, unsure where to go from here. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was close to shoving Rio away, ripping the door open and slamming it shut behind her without a care if Rio got caught in the middle. She didn’t care if her arm, leg, any limb got crushed in the doorframe. Agatha wanted out. She didn't want to play their stupid game any longer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And surprisingly, Rio didn’t either. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I can’t do this, Rio. I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck” Rio whispered, barely audible for Agatha to hear. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t think, just do. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before she was able to question it, press on the word and why Rio had said it- Agatha’s back collided against the door, her head bounced as a warm sensation was pressed on her cheek. She hissed, eyes closed before snapping open, about to ask what the hell Rio’s problem was. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Until the unimaginable happened. It </span>
  <em>
    <span>finally fucking happened. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s lips crashed against Agatha’s in a bruising manner. Their teeth smacked, sure to pierce a tiny bit of skin on both sides. They’d barely notice the subtle metallic taste of blood. It’d be disguised by their disbelief, the sudden explosive desire that’d been waiting to burst for three years. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The kiss didn’t last long enough for Agatha’s liking. Rio had pulled away after a few seconds, leaving Agatha's body leaning forward in a desperate chase, feeling the hand on her cheek slither down to press against her sternum. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pushed her back just an inch, enough for their eyes to meet again. Agatha pouted, pupils blown as she silently begged Rio to kiss her again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just..” Rio cut her off, shaking her head. “Tell me when we’re sober, this won’t change. You won’t regret this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio swallowed hard after asking Agatha to reassure her. Her mind raced, trying to figure out if the few second kiss had really happened or not. The taste of strawberry pancakes was on her tongue, Agatha looking bewildered and utterly desperate before her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha took a second before her lips curled up, letting out a broken laugh.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve only been trying to make this happen for years now” She said, bringing a hand up to push through Rio’s hair, muttering a low, “God, for the smartest professor I’ve ever met- You’re still such a complete and total fucking moron”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio puffed out a small laugh. “Still insulting me even through a compliment. Course, why am I not surpri-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, honey..you love it and you know it” Agatha said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her voice was stern as the blue eyes darkened. A deeper shade that screamed a threat for Rio to jump back while she still had a chance. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t dare to move a muscle. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I hate you, actually…in case you, uh..haven’t gotten the memo” She whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s hand moved down slowly, fingers wrapped around the nape of her neck- curling themselves into the roots of Rio’s hair. She flickered her eyes between the brown orbs that would lock her in for life more than ever- Back to Rio’s lips, the ones Agatha had craved for years, but now would desperately need as a lifeline to keep her heart beating. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You have a funny way of showing it, Vidal’ Agatha mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s hands both moved in sync, roaming down Agatha’s sides until they rested on her hips. She applied a slight amount of pressure. Enough that she watched Agatha’s breath hitch, eyes widened as she found Rio’s stare all over again.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Do I?” Rio questioned with slight amusement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smirked, standing up taller as she pointed out, “You kissed me, idiot” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The other woman shrugged, tracing her thumbs over the waistband of her sweatpants before letting her thumbs slip beneath them. Right in front of her hip bones, pressing against the skin as she rubbed tiny little circles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah..I guess I did just do that” Rio whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She bit her bottom lip down, pulling it back before letting go to whisper a confession that felt like a sin. One so sweet, but felt damning at the same time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want to do it again..” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Slowly, Agatha grinned. Although, the slow pace only lasted so long. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pushed herself forward, both hands moved to hold either side of Rio’s neck- thumbs pressed into her cheeks. The container of pancakes in her hand dropped to the floor, keys, wallet, and phone all following suit. She didn’t care if her phone screen was shattered or the mess of pancakes on the floor was left for Nicky to clean up. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(Agatha would stress and feel awful for risking a chance he’d get sick. Rio on the other hand would simply laugh, reassuring her he had gotten into much worse before and survived)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her lips were attached with Rio’s once again. The hint of chocolate and strawberry mixed together, saliva soaked their lips, little moans vibrated into each other. Just as Rio’s tongue peaked through, Agatha pulled back with a smirk to rush the little giggle bubbling within her.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Beat you to it” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled Rio back against her before she could argue, gasping as Rio didn’t hesitate to slip her hands up underneath her hoodie. But the tease, cheeky woman Rio was (Something Agatha would learn more and more overtime)- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pulled away, making sure the softly bite down on Agatha’s bottom lip to drag back with her until letting go, rasping a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you really making this out to be a competition right now?” She asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s eyes closed, jaw slightly ajar as she felt her entire body shiver from head to toe. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio tisked, shaking her head as she whispered, “And you wonder why I’ve hated you for years..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Neither had any more words to say. The torment of waiting three years, the past week, all built up to the point of overflow. They pulled and pushed, holding each other so close their bodies barely had space between them- if any. Their feet shuffled across the floorboards, barely careful to avoid bumping into any furniture or walls as they made their way back into the living room. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was so focused on how Agatha’s tongue danced with her own. They glided, tasted, devoured every inch- exploring the forbidden land. She barely thought about how their mouths were only a tiny corner of each other. The woman would drown in disbelief when the second clothes were shedded, lips and hands were able to navigate into uncharted areas. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The back of her legs hit the couch before feeling Agatha’s weight push her down. She whimpered at the loss of her lips, looking up to see the woman panting above. Only one thought entered Rio’s mind as she studied the way Agatha was looking down at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She’s going to kill me.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Rio had never been so suicidal before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her hands gently held Agatha’s thighs, roaming up the sides till she barely touched her hips. Within a split second, Agatha had gripped them with roughness that swore to leave bruises on her bones. Rio barely had a chance to breathe or make sense of what happened. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>All she knew was her back had hit the couch, Agatha’s body hovered above, Rio’s wrists pinned over her head. She arched her back, stretching out her spine as she pressed her front against Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You know,” Agatha whispered. “Typically, I don’t fuck on the first date, but..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She used her free hand to pin Rio’s back on the couch again. Her hand was an anchor, holding Rio down like it was her job. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Counting last weekend, flirting with you endlessly for three years-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Fuck me, Harkness” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The opposite of her trademark. Three words that nearly sent Agatha into overdrive with no brakes to press pedals into.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That was the opposite. Hence the reference” Rio clarified, but realized a second after. “Shit, uh..I probably didn’t have to clarify that. Fuck. Did I just kill the mood? I did, didn’t I? I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The hand on her hip left, not going far as her next destination was wrapped around Rio’s neck. Agatha applied just enough pressure to cut the rambling woman’s words off into a gasp. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha smiled, watching Rio’s lips part into a small ‘O’ shape. She shook her head, leaning down till her lips ghosted against Rio’s to whisper, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio..” She teased a chaste kiss, brushing their noses together before pulling away. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their eyes locked as Agatha’s thumb moved up to press against Rio’s lips. A gesture that screamed for Rio to be silent. She waited a few seconds, making sure Rio wasn’t going to say anything else before she asked, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are you still talking?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sound her question pulled out wasn’t the silence Agatha was asking for, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck, fuck, FUCK! </span>
  </em>
  <span>She wouldn’t argue in the slightest. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio whimpered. She fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>whimpered </span>
  </em>
  <span>and Agatha could’ve never imagined how beautiful a sound could be. Sure, she had daydreamed and wondered over the last three years what Rio sounded like in bed. However, none of it compared to the real deal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Though, that silence didn’t last long. Rio put on a tiny grin after a few moments, bringing up a question of her own, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are you still not fucking me?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s smile faded, but not into something harmful or negative. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“God, you’re annoying” Agatha muttered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And you still aren’t doing anything about it” Rio pushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman above chuckled in a dark, raspy tone. A stomach flipping nature that felt like a heat wave through their bodies. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So..” Agatha hummed. “Professor Vidal is not only a brat, but a bottom? Well, isn’t this an intriguing surprise” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Making assumptions is awfully brave. Especially since you still haven’t done a damn thing abou- </span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh!” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pressed the front of her thigh between Rio’s legs. She parted them, feeling warmth instantly. She grinned like a mad woman over the sensation. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Begging, pleading, and obviously so </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking</span>
  </em>
  <span> wet- I can nearly feel you soaking yourself through your own pants and mine” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She chuckled, not wasting a moment to let go of Rio’s wrists and hip. Slowly she moved, like a sloth climbing down Rio’s body. Her hands pushed Rio’s shirt up, exposing skin that looked softer than the fleece blanket beside them. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed, dipping her head down to leave kisses over her stomach. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Every movement was slow, delicate, unlike what she always thought would be. The woman figured they’d fuck purely out of hate. Everything would be aggressive, fast, a charged energy that’d leave them broken and battered by dawn. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>However, it was different. Something she felt was unordinary, but so beautiful at the same time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They didn’t need to speak for Rio to push up just enough to slip the shirt off, leaving her topless underneath Agatha’s gaze. She grinned as the piece of clothing was tossed somewhere in the room. Maybe it’d land on the coffee table, TV stand, floor or wherever- it didn’t matter. Not when Rio’s breasts were exposed. Another image Agatha had imagined and wondered about over and over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No bra,” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha whispered, running her hands up her skin to brush the edge of her tits before pulling back. She repeated the pattern until Rio was nearly squirming underneath her. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Were you hoping for this, sweetheart?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio weakly scoffed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Says the one who’s flirted with me for years. I’d say you’re the desperate </span>
  <em>
    <span>one!” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She inhaled a strong breath the second Agatha’s palms ran over her nipples, fingers grasping with nails digging into her skin. Rio tipped her head back, fingers tangling in Agatha’s hair as the woman’s lips wrapped around the sensitive bud on her right. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha switched back and forth, worshipping and giving attention to them both as if they were their own beings who needed to be seen- feel loved. Eventually, Rio’s hands started to push her lower, bringing out a strong warm laugh from Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eager?” She hummed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio mumbled under her breath, </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Te quiero tan mala”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha raised an eyebrow, pulling up a bit more to get a better look at Rio below.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“English, por favor?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled, a little chuckle as she shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Take a lucky guess-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tell me, or I’m not going to fu-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want you” Rio pulled her down, adding a quick, “So bad..” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha groaned before bruising them in a rough kiss. For every other movement being slow, drawn out- The way they kissed every time was messy, brutal, a crazed need to make up for lost time. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As they kissed, Agatha’s hand maneuvered down- fingers slipped under the waistband of her pants and boxers with no hesitation. She grinned, pulling apart from the kiss enough to whisper, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Boxers, huh?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her face flush, embarrassment only taking hold for just a second. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That’s hot” Agatha complimented.  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She pushed back into the kiss, groaning the way Rio slightly tugged the roots of her hair. Though her focus shifted back down south. Where her fingers were navigating through the patch of hair that was completely drenched. As if a downpour of rain had covered every pie-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, fuck- </span>
  <em>
    <span>Rio” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha moaned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Her fingertips had dipped between her folds. She barely brushed over the woman’s clit, overwhelmed with just how soaked Rio was.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This all because you hate me?” Agatha couldn’t refrain from the small tease.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio gasped, hips pushing up, desperate to be touched where she was craving most. Her prayers, wishes, pleads were answered before she was given a chance to reply to Agatha’s question. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had pressed her middle finger over her clit. She didn’t spend time teasing, went right to work pressing little designs against the delicate button that seemed to bring out the best in Agatha. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>First a few slow circles, followed by spelling out her own name- like casting sigils and spells for Rio to be her very own. The woman below was more than responsive. Broken moans, string of whines and whimpers. Agatha didn’t think it could get any better until-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Agatha” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Fuck” She cursed as Rio started to chant her name like a mantra. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman loved how Rio said her name, even if it was out of annoyance or frustration. But this? Through a mess of pleasure and desire? While she was touching her in a way she never thought would be possible?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You sound so fucking beautiful, Rio”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio thrusted her hips up, Agatha’s fingers gliding and slipping over her clit. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ve thought about this so many times..” Agatha admitted. “Wondering how you felt, sounded, </span>
  <em>
    <span>tasted” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The words only made Rio moan harder, head tipped back as her eyes squeezed shut. Agatha was having none of that though. She shook her head, pulling her finger away while demanding- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eyes on me, toots” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s head snapped right back to where it was. Their eyes met, Agatha finding the woman’s pupils absolutely blown out- Like they were balloons that had popped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s fingers slowly moved over her clit, slipping past until the tips of her fingers hovered at her entrance, waiting for the gates to open. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Tell me, how many fingers do you wan-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I want you..” Rio admitted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I know, honey. That much is clear, but..unfortunately with how insufferable and the amount of hate there is between us- I still don’t want to hurt you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, mumbling under her breath,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can’t hurt when I need you” She said. “Just, please, Agatha. Fuck me, I- </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She yelled out the curse as her back arched into a curved bridge, head tossed back as Agatha’s fingers had dipped just half an inch. Though they ripped away as Agatha chuckled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Eyes on me, come on” She encouraged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio whined at the little tease, but obeyed without a fight. Agatha would surely tease her for how easy she was to break. How she caved with barely any argument to offer. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>When their eyes met, Agatha’s middle and pointer pushed in achingly slow. This time more than half an inch. A full sink, a dive that left Agatha's fingers wrapped and suffocated in the soft, tight walls. Her thumb brushed against her clit, causing Agatha to feel a strong squeeze with such force, Agatha wondered if her bones would snap. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But, Agatha didn't care. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She'd fuck Rio with broken fingers. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She'd fuck Rio if it was her last dying breath. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She'd fuck Rio until the world ended. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Until Rio was spent and shattered beneath her, Agatha would fuck her to make the woman realize all the hate was bullshit. The game they had played for three years had been a waste of time. They'd sort whatever this was in the morning, but for right now? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha needed to make Rio Vidal, the woman who had been her most known enemy for years feel her love. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Wait. Wait. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's mind hesitated until she allowed herself to fully believe the fleeting thought that disrupted her for years. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman gasped, holding her tight as she inched closer to her high. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think…I uh, I lo-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Fuck, I'm gonna’ c-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha felt the deathly squeeze around her fingers. The pressure was unbearable, a flow of warm liquid coated and drenched her fingers more than they already were. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She didn't get the words out and maybe that was okay. There would be more time to say it. Other moments where maybe it made more sense. Plus, Agatha knew her vulnerable side could only handle so much. She’d regret the impulsive words later on, double guess and worry she had revealed far too much of herself. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Don’t ruin this by being an idiot..</span>
  </em>
  <span>She told herself.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha watched, studying close as Rio's eyes were shut. She didn't even notice their eyes parted as she came like a storm that raged beneath her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>That didn't matter. Not as Rio was trembling beneath her. The way she slightly turned enough to bury herself in Agatha's body. Her face hid in the crook of her neck and jaw, hand moved to grip the woman's hoodie and pull her down close. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>They remained still in each other's hold. The room around them was silent. Not even the TV was registered or the soft crunching of Nicky's kibble in the next room. Agatha only listened to Rio's breath go from frantic to steady. She felt Rio's walls around her fingers release, strength weakening as she came down from her high. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pumped her fingers a few times, amused at the way Rio jumped and whimpered- wiggling her hips as she mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Too much” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman chuckled, pressing a kiss on the top of her head while she went to pull her fingers out. Though Rio's hand flew down to press over the fabric. She held Agatha there, an unspoken plea to not leave yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thought you were too sensitive?” Agatha smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just..” Rio whispered. “Don't leave”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gasped, feeling how Rio buried herself impossibly closer. She slowly smiled, teasing in a small whisper, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is </span>
  <em>
    <span>the</span>
  </em>
  <span> stone cold, stubborn, Green Witch Vidal really clingy after sex?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed about to pull away when Agatha held her close. She shook her head, forcing their eyes to meet so Rio didn't just hear- No. Agatha needed her to </span>
  <em>
    <span>see</span>
  </em>
  <span> her when she said, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I'm not going anywhere” Agatha whispered, shaking her head as she smiled. “No more fucking off for this Harkness” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman beneath her vividly relaxed, nodding while all she had to say was a soft- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Okay” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha nodded. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can I?” She gestured down to her fingers. “Wrist is cramping. Won't lie” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio paused before letting out a soft, broken laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So old” She insulted. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gasped. “You're older than I am!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, smiling as if she was drunk on liquor. When in reality, it was an overflow of pleasure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, I- </span>
  <em>
    <span>Mmph!” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had thrusted her fingers back and forth, her thumb pressing against Rio's clit with a laugh. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I love this brand new power I hold to shut you up” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio groaned, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hate you” She mumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha slipped her fingers out, not bothering to drag them over her stomach. She didn't want to wipe them off in any capacity. Too eager, greedy to slip both digits between her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Instantly, her eyes shut as the sweet taste slipped over her tastebuds. She didn't see the way Rio was nearly drooling over the erotic sight, watching as Agatha sucked and cleaned every inch of the skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As sensitive as Rio was, no matter how overwhelmed this entire moment had driven her- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha” She gasped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman opened her eyes as her fingers (Now clean as if Rio's cum and arousal had never coated them) slipped back out. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You taste better than I ever imagined” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Typically, Rio would make fun of her for doing so. She'd tease, poke fun, pester Agatha for having such thoughts. But alas, the sensitive ache between her legs was growing stronger. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio swiped her tongue on the inside of her cheek before requesting, “Fuck me again” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Well, maybe that wasn't so much of a request, but an order. And suddenly, Agatha was willing to do anything Rio told her to do. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha leaned down, pecking her lips before whispering a soft, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As you wish, my worst enemy” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio paused before giggling softly. She lightly smacked Agatha upside the head with an eye roll. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I hate you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed. “Thank fuck for that” </span>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s eyes blinked open, adjusting to the morning sunrays casting rays through the bedroom curtains. They were only partially shut, forgetting from the night before. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stretched her back, rubbing hands over her face as she waited for the tiredness of a restless slumber to hit her. The typical groggy feeling of a poor night sleep always brought her. Though as the seconds turned into minutes, Rio realized-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I slept. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Calmness, serenity, a heavy peaceful feeling flowed through her from head to toe. The feeling was foreign, something she wasn’t used to. However, nothing would compare to the second feeling that hit her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The bed shifted, a little breath echoed in Rio’s ears. She looked over to her left, expecting regret and hatred to punch her in the gut. But once again, that easy feeling remained. If anything, it increased as her heart fluttered and stomach swirled with wonder. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The sun was casting a warm glow on Agatha’s face, shining the little drool that dribbled on the pillow below. Her eyes were still shut, a few strands of hair stuck to her face while the others were frazzled over the pillow and along the blanket. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio should feel disturbed her enemy was naked under her own bedsheets. She should hate herself, all her choices, regret the night before and yet..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>She stayed. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Part of her knew Agatha was true to her word when it came to how she wouldn’t be </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Fucking off” </span>
  </em>
  <span>, but there was always that strong worry. She was used to either being abandoned by morning or sending the woman home on her own terms. Rio felt neither choice was available. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t want Agatha to leave. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio didn’t want to make her leave either.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She let the few moments linger, drinking in the sight of someone she insisted on hating for so long. If you told Rio over the last three years (hell just a week ago) how she’d be laying in bed admiring Agatha Harkness- She would have slammed the door in your face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Three years, Rio had counted down the days till retirement or wished upon every shooting star Agatha would hit the road out of there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Three years, Rio told everyone and their brother how Agatha annoyed the hell out of her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Three years, and…Rio had accidentally fallen for the woman she hated most. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck my life. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Creeper” Agatha murmured.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Jesus shit!” Rio gasped as her body jolted, a hand smacked over her heart.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha's raspy chuckle echoed, followed by a taunting tune that somehow Rio loved and hated at once. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Busted, disgusted, never to be trusted” </span>
  </em>
  <span>She sang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio scoffed, shaking her head as she grumbled under her breath, </span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Jesus, you're such a fuckin’ child” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The raspy chuckle formed into a full laugh with a tiny snort snuck in between. A sound Rio knew she was damned to grow a stronger love for every single time it blessed her ears. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Honey, after last night I don't know if that's a wise take on it” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes, reaching over for her phone to grab off the end table. She saw the battery was nearly dead. Typically, that’d be her biggest concern. Unfortunately, the bold and clear, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>
    <em>7:27 AM</em>
  </b>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Took all of her worries front and center. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Shit!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was in the middle of reaching out to hold Rio close when the woman’s body jumped from the bed. She was frantically searching for clothes, rambling off a list Agatha was trying to catch every word to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It’s nearly eight! We gotta’ go uh, I’ll jump in the shower- No! Let Nicky out first, shower, you can grab clothes just in my closet whatever, uhhhhh- I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>As Rio was bouncing around the room, only tossing a shirt on since she was heading for a shower- Agatha moved to sit up against the headboard, hands behind her head as she enjoyed the show. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uh, we can figure out your car after- We can just take mine to there and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Rio” Agatha sighed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“No, it’s fine! I just- We gotta’-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m cancelling my classes. You do as you please, but..” Agatha reached over for her phone, gesturing in the air with it before adding, “My students can afford to miss a day. We’ll make up for it”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio went to argue, but the second she looked over- She felt her words come to a stop, brain short circuiting as she struggled to keep her composure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was topless, the golden rays shining over her breasts. The ones that had subtle red marks from fingernails and teeth scattered across them. Her hair was a mess, eyes squinting at the phone held close to her face. She paid no mind to Rio’s gawking stare, how she nearly dribbled drool onto the floor. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The look of Agatha Harkness naked in her bed was sexier than words could say. Of course, Rio felt the urge to lunge back on the bed, jump on her, kick off the engine to replay the whole night all over again. However, it weighed heavier than just her looks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>Agatha made the right side of the bed look lived in. She didn’t appear out of place or look weird being under Rio’s sheets. If anything, Rio felt Agatha belonged exactly where she sat as if she had been there for years. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck. I don’t love her. Don’t think that. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio cleared her throat, collecting what sense she could make of herself to try and talk her way out of there. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah well- I-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can’t take a break?” Agatha raised her eyebrow, peaking up from her phone with a little smirk. “That much is clear” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Before Agatha tossed her phone to the side, she hit what Rio assumed was </span>
  <em>
    <span>send </span>
  </em>
  <span>on the mass email that’d take work off her schedule. After doing so, she shuffled back under the sheet- Unfortunately, but thankfully hiding her chest from Rio’s sight. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Although,” Agatha yawned, snuggling back into the bed. “Maybe you're too nervous for us to both magically call out on the same day? Hm?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rolled her eyes, ready to argue, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“That-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Sleeping with her enemy- Oh what would they think? Would they know?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gasped, dramatic words with wiggling fingers gestured to Rio's neck. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Oo! </span>
  </em>
  <span>The real question here is- Do you even own a turtleneck?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt her heart drop. She spun around, nearly falling to race over to her mirror. And just like the red marks on Agatha’s tits, they covered her neck like polka dots. Her collarbone was decorated in scratch marks, most likely her back as well. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Shit. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She shook her head, shooting over her shoulder, “You’re an asshole for this. Really, Agatha. That-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not what you were moaning last night” Agatha grinned wide, voice chirping every word. “Actually, I recall a string of-” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She cleared her throat, putting on a mocking high pitch voice as she spoke, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Oh, I want you, need you! Agatha, fuck me. Don’t stop! Fu-”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio picked up the hoodie Agatha had been wearing off the floor. She tossed it in the air, making sure it hit the hysterical laughing woman in the face. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman shook her head, muttering under breath, “I’m going to shower..”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ta-ta!” Agatha sang. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio rushed to the back door, opening it for Nicky to run out of before racing into the bathroom. She tried to move quick, not pay any mind to anything else as she stripped her shirt off- turning the water knobs to let the water warm up. Unfortunately, her movements came to a stop when she looked in the bathroom’s mirror. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The dark hickeys not only decorated her neck, but made a path down her stomach, to her inner thighs. Scratch marks, subtle bruises from Agatha’s teeth- </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Holy fucking shit... </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s fingertips traced over them all one by one. Sure, she had rough sex before. It wasn’t uncommon with drunken hook ups, but…it was never the damage she wore. Although, Rio couldn’t classify or title them all as damage. More so, </span>
  <em>
    <span>worshipped</span>
  </em>
  <span>, </span>
  <em>
    <span>owned. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had devoured every single inch of her. Almost as if the woman was starved and Rio was the only meal in the universe to exist. Agatha didn't make her feel used like other women had. No. Rio felt not only seen, but..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Cherished. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She wore the marks with a sense of unspoken pride. An ego inside of her had been inflated like a balloon threatening to pop from the air being too much. Sure, Rio would panic and try to cover them up. However, she wouldn’t be able to hide the little smirk over the memory of each one. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman forced herself to jump in the shower, wash her hair and body off. She slowly felt her muscles ache. A bit of tylenol would fix that, but she’d be thinking about her heating pad all day- That was for sure. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio knew her three minute shower didn’t go to plan. Not when her eyes kept getting distracted as she washed her body, studying every trace of Agatha she left. Plus, part of her worried about stepping back out of the bathroom. The endless questions racing in her mind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Did she leave?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What if she left?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Was this just another hook up for her?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>One after the other, after the other. They piled on like bricks creating a tower size wall, a warning threat of destruction. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She slipped the same t-shirt back on after drying off, heading straight down the hall back into her bedroom. The bed was empty, Agatha’s spot vacant. For a second, Rio’s heart dropped. She feared the worst, wondering how the hell she’d make it through the day until-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Fucks sake- Rio!” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio jumped as she pulled her black slacks on, grabbing her bra and green button up shirt. With every movement, relief eased her sore muscles. She smiled to herself, losing herself in solace and comfort Agatha hadn’t left. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Rio!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha yelled again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She snapped the back of her bra while walking down the hall, slipping arms through the sleeves of her shirt. Rio worked on buttoning them down as she rounded the entry way of the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh my god. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She stopped at the threshold, fingers stopped to fiddle with the third button from the top. Her eyes widened, lips parted as her jaw dropped. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha was wearing one of her bigger flannels. A dark forest green one that always slipped down to her knees. It was held together by three buttons in the middle, offering a glimpse into all the same marks Rio wore on her own skin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The big square glasses were perched on her nose, hair tied back in a messy manner. Half pony tail, half bun- Only Agatha could make that style not only possible, but look effortlessly good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Well, I can get used to this..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha scoffed, hand on her hip while the other gestured to the coffee maker. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“This isn’t working” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio blinked and shook her head out of the trance she’d name </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Agatha stare” </span>
  </em>
  <span>for herself. She continued buttoning up the shirt while walking over. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, it does. You just gotta..” She lifted her hand, holding one side while aggressively smacking the other a few times. Instantly the liquid started to drip into the mug, Rio stepped back with a small nod. “See? Works” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha stood back, arms folded against her chest while looking between the half alive machine and a fresh out of the shower Rio-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Unfair how good she looks this early in the morning..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha huffed. “The thing is barely holding on for dear life. Why do you even use this thing?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shrugged while moving to find boots, calling back,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“It works, doesn’t it?!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha laughed. “You had to smack it more than five times!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio hopped along back down the hall while pulling one boot on, leaning against the doorway for the other. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Like I said, it works” She said. “You’re about to have a cup of coffee, are you not?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, an abused one” Agatha muttered, but her frown shifted into a small smile. She dramatically pushed the few strands of hair back, shaking her head as she asked, “Where are you going, dear?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed. “Work. Unlike you” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed, tapping her finger against her chin. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What will you do at work?” She questioned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio was finding her wallet and keys when she paused, turning on her heel to see the woman who looked up to no good. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Far</span>
  </em>
  <span> up to no good. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“We literally have the same job..what-” Rio shook her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What is she playing at?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, indeed we do, but..” Agatha shrugged, pointing at Rio with her lips pursed and eyes narrowed in on her. “You don’t have work with classes cancelled. So..what will you do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>What..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio placed a hand on the edge of the counter. The other lifted up to point at Agatha, muttering a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“What did you do?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha gasped, hand tossed over her heart as she wildly shook her head.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Me?! Do something?!” She asked. “Professor Vidal, what possibly could I have done with an unlocked and open PC in your offi-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha!” Rio exclaimed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha shrugged. “You delete my texts, I cancel your classes”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed out a laugh. “Are you serious right now?!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The coffee maker dinged, earning Agatha’s attention to grab her mug from it. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Only fair, wouldn’t you agree?” She asked. “Now, where do you keep your sugar and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I think one is a bigger deal than the other!” Rio exclaimed. “You can’t just fuck with my job like that. You know I can’t-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well, what is it the kids say? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Womp womp?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Agatha smirked before clicking her tongue. “Got the sugar! Scratch that”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She whistled while making her coffee. Stirring the sugar, milk, and even a dash of honey she found in the cabinet. Funny enough, Rio didn’t even feel bothered by how the woman rampaged her kitchen as if she had lived there herself. It was more disbelief Agatha had crossed that line. She used Rio deleting stupid drunken text messages as an excuse and yet-</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I still fucking like her. What the fuck?</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Had kissing her, letting Agatha fuck her senseless ruin every ounce of hatred? Was it now impossible for Rio to be mad or want to stay away from her?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shook her head, tossing her keys down as she muttered, “I hate you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mhm” Agatha chuckled, sipping from her coffee before raising the mug in the air. “That’s why you haven’t kicked me out of your house yet”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio huffed out an annoyed laugh. “Keyword, </span>
  <em>
    <span>yet” </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Then do it” Agatha shrugged. “Kick me out, end this sense you still </span>
  <em>
    <span>hate </span>
  </em>
  <span>me so much”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She slowly crossed the kitchen floor to the woman who was gripping the edge of the counter. Rio held a strong glare, not realizing how it weakened with every step Agatha took. She inched closer and closer, grinning the second she fiddled with one of Rio’s shirt buttons. A little laugh made Rio’s heart skip a beat as she mumbled,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Mhm, that’s what I thought” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“God,” Rio shook her head. “I really hate you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ditto” Agatha whispered with a wink, clearing her throat to speak at a normal volume again. “Now, since we have some free time on our hands- Maybe make me some breakfast, por favor?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Jesus.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio held her breath as Agatha started to undo her buttons. From the middle and then slowly worked her way down. She gripped the counter harder, stronger, swiping her tongue on the inside of her cheek while trying to appear angry. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So, you cancel my classes, rampage my kitchen then request breakfast?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha grinned, giving a small wink as she spoke. “Look at you. Such a smart professor, aren’t you? It’s a shame that won’t be utilized today”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio laughed, but it was low and annoyed as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You..you are fucking ridiculous” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And I..I’m still waiting for breakfast” Agatha smiled, echoing the same way Rio spoke. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rio clenched her jaw, stretched her neck side to side before shoving Agatha away. But, it wasn’t to end their morning together or completely get rid of her. Instead, she spun around to find the ingredients she’d need- hearing a small,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes!” from behind. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman couldn’t help but smile softly, shaking her head while asking over her shoulder,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you always this aggravating before eight AM?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio felt every muscle in her body become stiff, body tensing up as the unexpected arm from behind wrapped around her torso. A pair of lips kissed the side of her head before a soft whisper,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, but…this is special edition for the sexiest professor though” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She felt her body lean back, melting in Agatha’s hold as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Clearly not a professor in your eyes today” She grumbled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha hummed against her head, swaying them both side to side. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Little roleplay can’t hurt though?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio shivered. “You’re impossible”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You love it” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Unfortunately..I fucking do. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <span>Later that night, Agatha regretfully had gone home. Usually, Rio was happy when extra company in her home left. She was able to feel secured, locked back into her safe haven. Surprisingly, Agatha’s absence didn’t leave the same comfort others did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The house felt silent even when she played tug of war with Nicky, even with the TV on, even as the storm outside made the rain pour extra hard against her rooftop. Her couch felt vacant, she didn’t dare step foot into the bedroom. If the rest of the house felt so lonely, Rio couldn’t fathom how her bed would feel and she carried no wanting of figuring that out quite yet. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sunk into the couch, feet up on the coffee table with Nicky snuggled into her side. Rio had clicked some documentary on, something about a killer- She wasn’t paying attention to it. That was that. Rio was actually trying to fall asleep to ignore how depressing her house had become. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A space she once felt safe, warm, comfortable in now was the polar opposite. Dangerous, cold, lonely..</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck off, Harkness..</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The familiar phrase entered her mind, but as if it was a creepy way of clockwork? Or maybe Agatha was a mind reader from afar? </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio’s phone lit up, Agatha’s name bright on the screen. She had added her number to Rio’s contact list before taking off that night. A subtle way of reassuring their night wasn’t a one time deal. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She smirked slightly to herself, clicking the answer button as she brought it up to her ear.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Booty call already?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>A warm laugh graced her ear from the other line. Suddenly, Rio didn’t feel so cold in her own home anymore. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Don’t get your hopes up, toots” She said. “I’m just looking to ask if I left something at your place”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked around the living room, seeing if any of Agatha’s belongings were anywhere as she asked,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Uhh, what are you looking for? I’m not seeing any-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“My hair tie”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio stopped her words, movements paused as she registered the object Agatha was looking for. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She sat up, a hand rubbing the back of her neck as she asked, “Your…</span>
  <em>
    <span>hair tie?</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Yes, yes” Agatha sighed as if it was the most devastating loss in the world. “It’s my lucky one. The one” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio slowly smirked. </span>
  <em>
    <span>She’s bullshitting. Has to be.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Is it there?” Agatha questioned. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked on her wrist at her hair tie with a little smirk. Obviously, the accessory didn't belong to Agatha’s. But, curiosity got the best of her. If Agatha was bullshitting, lying through her teeth- She wouldn’t question who the hair tie actually belonged to. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ah-ha!” Rio faked the sound of finding it. “Well, would you look at that. It is here. Want me to bring it to you tomorr-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll just come back over to grab it. Lucky one and all” Agatha rushed. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Are you su-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’m grabbing my keys and such right now. See you in a bit?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio smiled softly, hating and loving the giddy feeling coursing through her at the idea of seeing Agatha sooner than tomorrow. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>But, she still sighed- trying to hide her excitement. “If you insist” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I insist, insist” Agatha said. “K’, coming over”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be here” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Keep my hair tie safe for me”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I will,” Rio smiled. </span>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p>
  <span>Rio opened the door, the sound of the pouring rain louder as it crashed on her porch roof and world around her. Though it was all muted, a muffled sound as the woman before her smiled wide. She was in black sweatpants with a raincoat over her body, not showing a sign of tiredness or being bothered by collecting her cherished lost item. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She held the black hair tie up with a smirk. “Looking for this?”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha dramatically sighed, knees caved as she pumped her fists in the air.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh! There you are” She beamed, taking it from her hand to slip over her wrist. “Been looking everywhere for you”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snickered, finding far too much amusement at the sight of her theatrical show. She didn't need Agatha to confess to how the hair tie was all a lie. A scheme Rio wondered how long it took for her to plot before putting it into action. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Thank you..” Agatha said, looking behind at the pouring rain with yet another dramatic sigh. “I guess I should get going before the rain is even worse. I always hate driving in it and-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha..” Rio said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha whipped around, about to say something when Rio stepped aside with a low,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just get in here”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, thank you” Agatha groaned, taking her jacket off as she walked inside. “I wasn’t sure how much longer I could keep that fuckin’ charade going” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The door swung shut, Rio didn’t hesitate to grab Agatha’s hips the second the coat was hung up. She smirked, face inches away from the woman who was rubbing her hands up over Rio’s shoulders. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Lucky hair tie, huh?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh very, look where I am..” Agatha smirked. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Just as Agatha was about to kiss her, Rio pulled back with a little shake of her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Funny thing though..” Rio said. “That’s my hair tie” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha’s grin faded, red flooded her cheeks as she bit down on her lips. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So uh,” She stammered, putting on a tiny grin as she sang. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Busted, disgusted, never to be trusted?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio grinned. “Big time” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Complaints?” Agatha questioned.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Not a single one,” Rio replied. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha pulled her in for a soft, delicate, kiss. Both sighed with relief as if they had gone without one another for years again. Before things were able to progress, become too heavy, Agatha pushed her back to whisper,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I’d still argue it’s a lucky hair tie”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio paused before a little laugh as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Just fuck me, Harkness” She ordered.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha sighed, slightly pushing her back for them to stumble along the same trail all over again. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“As you wish..”</span>
</p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>
  <span>The rest of the week had flown by in the blink of an eye. Rio wasn’t completely surprised to find out the night of the hair tie trick, Agatha had an overnight bag packed in her car- determined to not leave until she had to. Unsurprisingly as well, she only left for work a few minutes after Rio. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Both agreed to keep things under the table. They arrived at their usual times, but their banter was noticeably absent. Well, to everyone else. To the two of them, they were doing an excellent job at hiding the very obvious. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha had started to steal Rio’s clothes by Wednesday night when she was out of her own. She took from the back of the closet in hopes people wouldn’t recognize the articles of clothing worn by Professor Vidal first. That didn’t help the two keep their appearance normal. Not when it caused Rio’s staring to be more than usual, stuck in a trance for how good Agatha looked in her clothes. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It wasn’t just the way she owned them, looking marvelous beyond words could ever say. But, Rio felt a sense of pride. Almost as if Agatha was her own to keep. Her clothes were a little mark and claim she had. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And part of Rio slowly lost care if people noticed the clothes belonged to her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their nights slowly shifted into a routine. They’d both get home around the same time, stumble into the shower together- Maybe end up in bed with dinner being forgotten. They’d play in the backyard with Nicky, both laughing as they ended up tackling each other instead.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <br />
  </span>
  <span>Or, it’d be like where they currently sat. Both on the couch with yet another binge of Law and Order on the TV. Bowls of ice cream sat in their lap, bickering over who was right about how the episode would end. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Can I have more sprinkles?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio looked over, a little smile as she shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I told you to pour more than just that, but no-no! Why listen to little old me-” She said. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha picked up her leg off of the woman’s lap, kicked her foot against Rio’s chest, earning a small, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Oof!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ridiculous” Rio muttered, pausing the show before standing up. “You know, you have feet that work- You can get your own damn sprinkles!” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She yelled over her shoulder as she disappeared into the kitchen, leaving Agatha puffing out a little snort as she mumbled, </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“And yet, you’re doing it for me”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman continued to eat her ice cream, humming a soft tune as she watched Nicky bite and thrash around the small rope toy. Agatha had bought it for him the other night on a trip to Walmart with Rio. She made a sex joke out of the rope, of course. But overall, she was the one who spent way too much time in the pet aisles- finding things to spoil the boy with. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Too busy in her own mind, she didn’t hear the front door open- Only noticed as Nicky jumped up and a high pitch singing voice rang in the air like a bell,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Yooo-whooo!</span>
  </em>
  <span> Are you?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The woman stopped in her tracks, Agatha paused mid ice cream bite as she looked up to find a pair of redheads staring wide at her. She slowly put the bowl back down on her lap, hearing Rio rush back out with the sprinkles container shaking in the air. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Your servant brings you your precious sprinkle-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio paused as her eyes caught the duo across the living room. She stopped talking, words cut before cutting into a shocked,</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Hey..guys”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Natasha and Wanda both nodded in sync, small grins as they returned the hello. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“You forgot about dinner, didn’t you?” Wanda asked.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio pulled her lips back, shifting side to side while holding up sprinkles. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Ice cream for din-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“I uh, I should go” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha started to stand up, but Wanda was quick to shake her head. She shoved the dish of casserole against Natasha’s chest, nearly hopping over as she rambled. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nonsense! The more the merrier. Besides, another buffer to deal with the old grump here”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>She gestured to Rio who only rolled her eyes at her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh, I wouldn’t want to intrude”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Natasha shook her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Nonsense. Wanda made far too much food again-”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Bad habit” Wanda shrugged. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Another person eating means less leftovers I’m stuck with for lunch all week” Natasha sighed. “You’d be doing me a favor”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wanda scoffed, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Oh poor you,” She mocked. “Your wife makes sure you eat, what a terrible life you live”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Rio snickered, unable to hold back her amusement. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“So!” Wanda grinned. “I’m Wanda, this is my wife- Natasha” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The other woman gave a small wave behind her. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Who do we have the pleasure of meeting?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Agatha subtly looked over her shoulder, making sure Rio was fine with the situation. She only shrugged, silently saying it was up to Agatha on what she wanted to do. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Without another second to waste, Agatha flipped her hair to the side. She held her hand out, a proud smile crawled upon her face as she said the name Rio knew would damn her for eternity. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Agatha Harkness” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Wanda’s grin faded before it grew wide like never before. Natasha’s eyes opened, suddenly more energetic than how she showed up. They both glanced over to Rio who was playing with the sprinkles bottle, avoiding eye contact all together.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I’m so never hearing the end of this one. </span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Well..” Wanda shook her hand, nearly jumping in the air. “This is going to be a lovely night!”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>
    <span>That’s one way to look at it....</span>
  </em>

</blockquote><hr /><p>“This is really good” Agatha complimented Wanda’s dinner, followed by a quick- “Wanda, right?”</p><p> </p><p>“More like Gordon Ramsey,” Natasha smirked, replying before the other woman had a chance to do so. “Her cooking may be incredible, but she’s a vicious being in the kitchen”</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha chuckled as Wanda rolled her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>The group were sitting outside. The back deck table creaked with every movement, chairs rusted from the amount of time they had spent outside. Worn out, used and well loved. The sunset was turning dark into the early night, casting shadows around them. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda and Natasha sat next to each other on one side, Agatha and Rio straight across from them. The duo who knew Rio well wouldn’t voice it aloud, but after they left that night words would be said through gasps and laughs. They’d point out the obvious, find every part of Rio hysterical. </p><p> </p><p>From how she was nervously chewing at her lip more than her food. The way she tried to keep her eyes off Agatha, but failed miserably to do so. How Agatha sat beside her and Rio didn’t dare move a muscle. </p><p> </p><p>It was more than amusing to them both. They actually felt hope Rio wouldn’t be sitting alone like an old grump the rest of her life. </p><p> </p><p>“Ignore her completely,” Wanda said, putting on a soft smile right after. “But, yes. It’s Wanda”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, holding her fork up in the air as if it was a champagne glass to raise a toast. </p><p> </p><p>“Well, <em> Gordon Ramsey Wanda </em>, you are quite the cook” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda shook her head over the nickname that had caught on over the years. Now adding on another woman to call her in. The others fell into a soft laugh, but Wanda quickly cut through them with a chirping tone. </p><p> </p><p>“Anywaaaaay!” She drew the word out, putting her fork down to clap her hands. “Less about me, Agatha and more about you!”</p><p> </p><p>Natasha swallowed her food with a nod. “Mm! Rio’s told us you’ve worked at the university for a few years now?” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused mid bite, her fork lowering as a slow grin stretched across her face. She tilted her head, looking over to Rio who was sinking more into her seat, using the food to hide herself. </p><p> </p><p>“She’s talked about me? How interesting..”</p><p> </p><p><em> Here we go.. </em>Rio groaned in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back over at the couple, asking a small, “Good things I’d hope?” </p><p> </p><p>Natasha puffed out a short laugh, Wanda shot a glare at her wife before snapping her attention back at Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Well-”</p><p> </p><p>“Her worst enemy, right?” Agatha chuckled. </p><p> </p><p>“Um,” Wanda said, shaking her head. “More like-”</p><p> </p><p>“Worst nightmare” Natasha shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda lightly smacked Natasha’s shoulder which only made the woman laugh harder. Agatha smiled, shaking her head as she lightly chuckled. </p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to lie, Gordon-”</p><p> </p><p>“I fucking love this chick” Natasha laughed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned over, nudging Rio’s arm with a smirk. “I am well aware of Professor Vidal’s so called <em> hatred </em>for me” </p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed, rolling her shoulders back as she swallowed her food before speaking, </p><p> </p><p>“In my defense-” She started. “You had been incredibly annoying since your first appearance”</p><p> </p><p><em> “Had?” </em>The three asked in sync. </p><p> </p><p>And suddenly, Rio hated all of them more than she ever hated Agatha alone. </p><p> </p><p>“I guess I’ve graduated from being annoying to-”</p><p> </p><p>“Being insufferable” Rio cut off. </p><p> </p><p>“Hm, insufferable enough to be on your couch eating ice cream?” Wanda asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh!” Natasha perked up. “Insufferable enough to be her- What was it? <em> Sprinkle servant?” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned, grabbing her plate as she muttered under her breath, “I’m not being sober for this”</p><p> </p><p>She pushed up from the table, storming off inside as the three women behind laughed amongst themselves. </p><p> </p><p>Embarrassment was taking hold stronger than ever. Rio scraped the leftover bits of her food in the garbage, nearly shattering the plate in the sink. She was thankful to have a few moments alone. A plan in action to find a beer, alcohol of any sorts to drown this entire night out.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> This is..fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She popped the cap off, tossing it in the garbage before tilting the bottle back against her lips. The cold liquid ran over her tongue, down her throat. Rio could only hope the effects would hit her soon enough. Maybe not being sober would help her power through this.</p><p> </p><p><em> Why am I like this? </em>Rio wondered.</p><p> </p><p>Shouldn’t she be happy her friends were getting along with Agatha? The entire dinner had gone by in what felt like two seconds. With her exes, dinners dragged on and on. Wanda always had something to say after, Natasha nodding along and making her own little comments. </p><p> </p><p>Rio always knew it’d be coming when the second dinner was nearly over or even worse, barely began. The two gave her a certain look that said,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “She isn’t the one”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>In which, okay- Fine. Maybe letting your friends have such a powerful, large impact on your dating life wasn’t for the best. However, it didn't happen. The two would’ve given her a look by now. The energy during dinner would have been awkward, slow. Unlike with Agatha, it was a dinner Rio had never experienced before. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha fit in perfectly with them. She kept up with the banter, the laughter was endless with her. Rio felt comfortable by her side, mesmerized by her perfect beauty. How she melted in, a puzzle piece that was found after being lost for so long. </p><p> </p><p>So..why the hell was she so embarrassed?</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was losing her well known reputation of hating Agatha Harkness. After all, stating something powerful and stubborn for three years straight. Arguing left and right giving her a chance to be a tolerable person in Rio’s life wouldn’t happen. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Why am I- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Rio..” </p><p> </p><p>And just like that, being alone didn’t last as long as she’d have liked it to. </p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned, shaking her head. “Don't start-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha Harkness is in your house?!” Wanda whispered. </p><p> </p><p>“What about ‘<em> don't start </em>’ do you not understand?!” Rio exclaimed in the same harsh whisper. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda took care of the three dishes because <em> of course- </em>She offered to take Agatha’s plate. Knowing Wanda, she was going to bring drinks out and make sure to continue this night- drag it and Rio’s embarrassment farther along. </p><p> </p><p>“She's not only here. In your house. On your couch. Eating ice cream, but also- She’s wearing your fucking clothes!” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> As if this couldn’t get any worse... </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio took another swig, shrugging her shoulders as she replied,</p><p> </p><p>“Or, we just have a similar taste in fashion”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda scoffed, a wide grin as she looked over her shoulder. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio, you’ve owned those grey sweatpants since you were twenty six. And! I bought you that hoodie!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha began to sing the familiar taunting song in her mind, </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Busted, disgusted, never to be trusted. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Another swig, longer this time- Almost tempted to down the entire bottle in one go of it to crack open another. </p><p> </p><p>She scratched the back of her neck, shoulders shrugging for what felt like the millionth time. Rio began to stammer her words, struggling to come up with an explanation for anything other than the obvious.</p><p> </p><p>“I- Listen- Okay, she-”</p><p> </p><p><em> “I- Listen. Okay, she!” </em>Wanda mocked, shaking her head. “Don’t you lie to me! It’s clear as day! How else would you describe your known enemy in your house and clothes?!”</p><p> </p><p>“We’re friends!” Rio said. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda laughed. “Oh my god- Might as well go with the old, they were roommates at this rate! God, you’ve always been a terrible liar”</p><p> </p><p>Rio muttered a few curse words under her breath, leaning her lower back against the counter. She pinched the bridge of her nose, tapping fingers against the side of her beer bottle. </p><p> </p><p>“I just don’t get it..” Wanda sighed. “You two are obviously <em> perfect </em>together. Why do you keep lying-”</p><p> </p><p>“We aren’t even together, Wanda..” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a total lie, per say. They hadn’t necessarily discussed what was going on between them. It’d only been a week or so since their whirlwind of enemies to lovers-</p><p> </p><p><em> Oh my god. I’m in a fucking cliche trope. </em>Rio realized. </p><p> </p><p>Even worse to that realization? The woman who called it, nailed the hammer on the head, was the one to predict Rio’s future stood before her. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean-”</p><p> </p><p>“We just aren’t!” Rio shrugged. “I’m pretty certain this is just some…fling, hook up sort of situat-”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda gasped, hands flying up to cover her mouth as she started to bounce off the heels of her feet. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh for fucks-”</p><p> </p><p>“Hook up?! Fling!?” Wanda whispered in a giddy tone. “You slept together?! Oh, I knew it! Wait, wait- How was it? Did you fuck her- She fuck you? Or-”</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda” </p><p> </p><p>“Your dry spell is finally over! The curse has been lifted, oh my god!” Wanda laughed. </p><p> </p><p>The woman reached over, grabbing Rio by the shoulders, shaking her back and forth as if she were trying to rid all of Rio’s hesitations. </p><p> </p><p>“I need details, Rio. Like. <em> A S A P!” </em> She said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, desperate to hide how her skin burned. The memory of Agatha’s body against her own. Her moans, words, voice a ghost in the back of her mind. </p><p> </p><p>She shook her head harder, muscles in her body tightening like a string being wound up- fighting against its hold. </p><p> </p><p>“Nothing to detai-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio Vidal, you haven’t had sex in God knows how long now. Give it up. Spill!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio half turned to put the beer bottle down behind her. She covered her face with both hands, shaking her head as she groaned a muffled,</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda. No..just-” </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my godddd” Wanda drew out the word, letting go as she placed her hands on her hips. </p><p> </p><p>The woman stepped back, giving Rio space to hide in her shell even more. A turtle inverting her neck, escaping the daylight into her own darkness. </p><p> </p><p>For once in Wanda’s lifetime, it was hard to completely read Rio like a book. She caught a glimpse of the embarrassment, possibly guilt for holding hatred so long. There were nerves mixed in as well. </p><p> </p><p>However, a feeling was trapped beneath the surface. Something that Wanda couldn’t exactly quite pin. Neither could Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda nodded, deciding to lay off and give in to Rio’s demands of letting it go. She didn’t want to drop the subject, but she knew Rio well enough that pressing harder wasn’t going to do much.  </p><p> </p><p>Although, Wanda wouldn’t give up that easily. Not without making Rio clarify her weak attempt at bullshitting away from the obvious, trying to make it appear it wasn’t as it seemed. </p><p> </p><p>“Fine.” Wanda said, her tone serious- a hint of frustration matching it. “So. You and Agatha. Just a hook up? Nothing more?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio took in a deep breath, hesitating before she weakly nodded- forcing it into a stronger one. She rubbed her hands down her face, dragging her cheeks down before letting them rest on either side of her neck. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda narrowed her eyes, lips parting to argue, but Rio beat her before she could.</p><p> </p><p>“Just…<em> fuck buddies” </em></p><p> </p><p>Wanda asked. “Nothing more?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing less..” Rio replied. </p><p> </p><p>“Mhm..” Wanda hummed, not buying the reply for a second. “And why only that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio forced a laugh. Wasn’t it obvious?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t want something more. In Rio’s mind, it was screaming on repeat louder day by day how this would inevitably end. This all could be one evil prank, a joke that involved pulling one over Rio. Revenge for hating her for three years. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had drowned them out, letting herself enjoy being in the moment. But like clockwork, Wanda was there to snap her into reality. Smack her out of delusions, bring her back to earth. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not..” Rio shook her head. “I don’t want anything more”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had to restrain a laugh over that. It was a pathetic lie, Rio even knew her words were bullshit. All she wanted day by day was something more. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t want Agatha to leave. She had a nightmare a few nights prior Agatha was in the arms of another woman. If you told her weeks ago that thought would make her feel sick, Rio wouldn’t believe you for a second. </p><p> </p><p>However, it was there. The fear of Agatha slipping away. She worried this would be a blip in her life. A brief moment that’d feel like a dream, something that almost never existed. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda sighed. “Rio-”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I’m serious..” She said. “I- You know I can’t stand her. I haven’t in years. This is out of boredom. I’m sure it’s the same on her end”</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her heart ache with every word she spoke. A lie that kept on killing her slower than starvation ever could. </p><p> </p><p>“Why do you do this?” Wanda asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Do what?”</p><p> </p><p>“You-”</p><p> </p><p>Footsteps came through the backdoor, AGatha’s presence dominating the space as she always did with any room she stepped into. Rio’s eyes widened, panic striking through as she cleared her throat- grabbing her beer to take a significant swig from it. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, hey” Wanda smiled, appearing as if nothing was wrong. “We were just heading back ou-”</p><p> </p><p>“Actually, I gotta go. Crisis date savior has been requested” </p><p> </p><p>She held her phone up, wiggling the device as she referenced it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look to see the fake smile Agatha wore. She already heard it in her voice, her sudden departure that lined up perfect to get out of Rio’s home. </p><p> </p><p>The woman didn’t suggest to herself Agatha had overheard her. Instantly, her mind screamed how she regretted ever being here. This was it. The clock had run out, their time together was over. By Monday, things would be back to normal and this would cease to exist.   </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, well..” Wanda sighed. “It was really nice meeting you. I hope we get to do something in the future! I know you’re dealing with a recluse here though. Getting her out of the house is like pulling teeth”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckled, but there was no warmth. Just a sound echoed into a void.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll uh, bring these back to you on Monday” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha referenced her clothes, but Rio didn’t pay attention. She just nodded, panic drinking from her beer as they all mumbled goodbyes to one another. </p><p> </p><p>The front door opened and shut. Rio felt the familiar emptiness fill her entire home. Even with her two closest friends still present, her beloved dog running around with glee- It was vacant. No life as if Rio had become Death, doomed to exist for eternity without any love or being around her. </p><p> </p><p>The woman was so lost in her solitude, ripped to shreds layer by layer- She didn’t hear Natasha walk in or see the look on her face. Only being snapped out of it with Wanda breaking the tense silence behind her. </p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Wanda asked. </p><p> </p><p>Natasha ran a hand through her hair, teetering side to side as she shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>“Pretty sure something may have been said in this kitchen that uh, said <em> enemy </em> did not like hearing” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s own heart broke, looking back over to Rio as she exhaled a long breath. </p><p> </p><p>Before she was able to say something, Rio slammed her beer down- Excusing herself to the bathroom, never hearing behind the low voices that blended in sync with one word,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Shit” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio nearly tripped over her own two feet flying down the small hallway. The bathroom door swung open, nearly flying off the hinges and punching through the frame when she slammed it shut. Her back pressed against it, holding herself up the best she could. </p><p> </p><p>Her knees wanted to cave, body weakening into a messy pile of bones. A puddle of what she once was. The thought of Agatha hearing those words felt worse than Agatha not wanting her. Why was that? </p><p> </p><p>She always hated Agatha, never wanted her to be around, always shoved her away and-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Shit. I fucking love her.  </em>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>No, no. That couldn’t be it. How do you fall in love with someone you just hated days ago? </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Because, never actually hated- Yes, I fucking did- do! No- I- </em>
</p><p>“Ugh!” </p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose as she squeezed her eyes shut. If her thoughts kept having an argument of their own, Rio was sure her head would explode. </p><p> </p><p>Her silence in solitude wasn’t gifted to her for long. Which wasn’t surprising, not when Wanda was only down the hall from her. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t knock, didn’t ask- Simply cracked open the door and stuck her head inside with a small smile. One that Rio didn’t bother to look at. Even if it was an empathetic sad one, a smile filled with understanding- </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t want to see it. <br />She didn’t want to see anything or anyone. </p><p> </p><p>Unless your name was Agatha Harkness, but..not even Rio would admit that. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda closed the door behind her, leaning against it as she whispered, “Looks cozy..”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed, turning the water on, letting the temperature run as cold as possible. She let her fingertip stay in the stream, unsatisfied until the sensation made her gasp from how frozen it felt. Only then did she bring both hands under to splash a good amount on her face. </p><p> </p><p>“Want a washcloth?” Wanda asked.</p><p> </p><p>Cold water was always a tactic Rio used to bring herself back down from panic or emotional distress of any kind. Wanda would never forget finding her in the shower, frozen as can be when Rio thought she lost Nicky. (He was hiding in the kitchen cabinet where Rio kept her snacks) </p><p> </p><p>However, Rio shook her head as she turned the water off- stepping back to sit on the edge of the bathtub. </p><p> </p><p>She kept her eyes down, fiddling with her thumbs as she nibbled on her bottom lip. Wanda didn’t expect Rio to willingly speak to her. She prepared to fight and pry, annoy and pester until Rio either freaked out or kicked her and Natasha out of the house. Whatever it took, Wanda was prepared to do so. </p><p><br />The woman ran a hand through her hair, taking in a breath to collect words, about to speak when-</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think she heard?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda snapped her head back up, eyes wide as she scrambled to redirect. Rio wasn’t one filled with surprises. She was someone who never went off script, always stayed the same. A routine that never changed. </p><p> </p><p>But now? </p><p> </p><p><em> Agatha Harkness has gotta’ be a witch.. </em>Wanda thought to herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Um,” Wanda hummed, tilting her head side to side. “I mean..possibi-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t sugarcoat it” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda scoffed. All of her sweet, tender, nice and soft caring demeanor was swept away. She put her hands out at her sides, snapping with a quick reply, </p><p> </p><p>“What do you think?” She asked. “Yes. She heard it. Agatha now thinks you don’t want anything serious with her. No, actually- She thinks you still hate her and whatever you two have been up to is out of boredom and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay!” Rio groaned.</p><p> </p><p>She pushed herself down backwards, letting her legs hang over the edge of the bathtub while her body sulked into itself. Rio hid her face in her hands, hoping if she hid long enough- All of this would just go away. Her feelings for Agatha, the situation entirely, everything. </p><p> </p><p>Yet, as the seconds turned into minutes? Reality wasn’t able to be ignored. This situation wasn’t fake, something she could click her heels and escape from. </p><p> </p><p>“Can you please…just believe something good for once?” Wanda asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up, eyebrows furrowed.  “What do you mean?” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda crossed the bathroom to climb in the bathtub beside her. Their shoulders were side by side, legs dangling off the edge. Rio watched as her best friend groaned, muttering under her breath, </p><p> </p><p>“We’re getting too old for this spot, Rio”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered, offering a helping hand only for it to be smacked away. </p><p> </p><p>“Ow-”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh hush!” Wanda huffed, adjusting her clothes as she tried to settle in a comfortable position. </p><p> </p><p>Well- As comfy as you could be sitting in a bathtub. Rio always did pick the oddest places to have a meltdown or hide from the world. </p><p> </p><p><em> At least we’re not under the table or in the cabinet when we were kids… </em>Wanda figured to herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Now,” Wanda cleared her throat, taking in a breath before looking over to her right. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was looking away, picking the skin off her thumb again. She could read all the nerves firing off of her, little ashes from the flames landing on Wanda with every second that passed. </p><p><br />Wanda gave Rio the floor to speak again if she wanted, but this time around- Rio went back into her old ways. The quiet shell, one hard to crack. </p><p> </p><p>The redhead beside her sighed, bringing her soft voice back like it had never left. “I couldn’t figure you out earlier, but…I just clicked it” </p><p> </p><p>Rio peaked up, eyebrows furrowed as her eyes spoke the question in a silent whisper- “<em> What?” </em></p><p> </p><p>“You’re not believing this could be something good” Wanda shook her head. “You’re just going to avoid it..” She added, whispering a low, “Aren’t you, Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>The woman looked back at her fingers, the skin around her nails picked apart and torn to shreds. She knew the next day the stinging pain would catch her off guard, but..at least it wouldn’t hurt like the inevitable. </p><p> </p><p>Rio would much rather wake up with a stinging burn from her skin being ripped over finding a bed empty, having to go back to life as if she never knew how good it felt to not hate Agatha Harkness. </p><p> </p><p>She pulled her lips back, biting on them with a shake of her head. </p><p> </p><p>“She..” Rio sighed, struggling to say the words. “She’s not-”</p><p> </p><p>“She wants you..” Wanda said. “She isn’t out of your league, doesn’t deserve better- Don’t give me that crap” She added. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted in her spot, lips parted to argue. However, Wanda punched her to the side to continue on. </p><p> </p><p>“And yes. Natasha and I are going to tease you for eternity. So, swallow your pride and push the embarrassment aside” She nudged with a little grin. “You falling for your enemy, Rio- Come on, that’s material even you yourself would work with”</p><p> </p><p>She rolled her eyes, hating how her cheeks grew warm and she couldn’t hide even if she tried. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you really going to let embarrassment have a say in this?” Wanda asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up, confused, unsure of what she was going at. </p><p> </p><p>“Why let being embarrassed you fell for your sworn enemy take something this good away from you?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda knew embarrassment wasn’t the reason they were in the bathtub after Rio was lying through her teeth back in the kitchen.  Of course, she was experiencing it big time. Especially with how unexpected the dinner and them meeting Agatha was. </p><p> </p><p>But, that was only a sliver- barely an ingredient to what was going on. </p><p> </p><p>“I would tell you if I thought this wasn’t good for you” Wanda said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. </p><p>“Natasha is meaner than I am too, remember..” She shoved her shoulder with a small grin. “She would have been escorting Agatha out the door if she had any negative feeling on her”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m supposed to have negative feelings about her”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well..you don’t” Wanda said. “We can’t always control these things, you know that..” She added. "But..what you can control?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fix the mess I just made?” Rio asked. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda grinned. “Ding-ding-di-”</p><p> </p><p>“No, shut up” Rio muttered, hiding her face back in her hands. </p><p> </p><p>Wanda chuckled. “You know what I am. Say it, sayy ittt-”</p><p> </p><p>“Very annoying”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope! Close-”</p><p> </p><p>“How is that close?”</p><p> </p><p>“Close to what?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed. “Close to you being ri-” She put her finger up, catching on with a little laugh. “Nice try. Very nice, well done. I’ll give you props for that”</p><p> </p><p>The woman belted out a laugh, smiling wide as she sat up. “I’m right and you know it!” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She is. She really fucking is.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Wanda checked the time on her phone, faking a sigh Rio could see right through. She knew Wanda through and through, well enough to know her little ways of setting up a departure. </p><p> </p><p>“It’s late,” She said. “Better get Natasha home before she-”</p><p> </p><p>“Just shut up and get out” Rio snickered. </p><p> </p><p>The woman gasped, a hand tossed over her heart as she shook her head. </p><p> </p><p>“How rude!” </p><p> </p><p>“I know your pathetic cover up excuses!” Rio laughed. “You’re just hoping I run out of here to chase Agatha down. Jokes on you, I don’t even know her address and she sure as shit isn’t going to answer me now” </p><p> </p><p>Wanda scoffed. “Come on, you’re better than this”</p><p> </p><p>“What? I just told you-”</p><p> </p><p>“Rio. You used to track my drunk ass down in college endlessly. I think you can manage to track down your <em> co-worker” </em> </p><p> </p><p>She spoke while standing up, Rio instinctively held her hand to guide her out of the tub. Wanda turned on her heel once she collected herself. She pointed with a low,</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll regret this if you don’t-”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have her address!” </p><p> </p><p>“And you didn’t have all those frat houses, bars, diners, wherever the hell my binging and parties led me to. But..you found me. Every. Single. Time” </p><p> </p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head as she looked away. </p><p> </p><p>“This is different, Wan-”</p><p> </p><p>“It really isn't,” She said. “Technology and your brain have come a long way, don’t you think?”</p><p> </p><p>Wanda then put her hand up, tilting her head to the side with nose scrunched,</p><p> </p><p>“On second thought, technology has come a long way. You? Not so mu-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t you have to leave?” </p><p> </p><p>The woman’s hands raised up in surrender, but her eyes still pointed with arrows- More so, daggers of their own. </p><p> </p><p>“You’ll regret this-”</p><p> </p><p>“Wanda!” Rio groaned. </p><p> </p><p>“Listen, you know my bullshit excuses to leave- I know what you’ll regret”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t leave room for discussion, not an argument or time for Rio to make more excuses. Wanda tossed a wave over her shoulder as she left the bathroom door open behind. Rio heard Nicky’s footsteps following the two out the kitchen and to the front door. </p><p> </p><p>“Do something!” Wanda yelled. </p><p> </p><p>“Call her, Rio!” Natasha called out. </p><p> </p><p>“Get out!” Rio yelled back. </p><p> </p><p>Nicky didn’t hesitate to run down the hall, jumping into the bathtub right next to her where Wanda once was. She focused on scratching his ears, holding him close as her mind began to race its own marathon all over again. </p><p> </p><p>The idea of going back to normal, chancing Agatha ignoring her like the week she had before. That was hell, pure fucking <em> hell. </em>Rio thought being annoyed by Agatha was bad, but then being ignored by her? </p><p> </p><p>Oh, it was worse. So much worse. </p><p>
  <em> “Do something”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio silently cursed Wanda under her breath as she found her phone snug in her pocket. Seriously, what was she supposed to do? She had never been to Agatha’s and the thought of texting Alice asking for her address- </p><p> </p><p><em> Oh, I’d never hear the end of it. </em> </p><p> </p><p>The woman was just realizing herself there was no hatred left. Not a shred, sliver, a pinch of resentment for Agatha Harkness in her. That was a hard enough pill to swallow. Rio didn’t need the teasing and questions from others on top of it. That was a problem to encounter down the line. </p><p> </p><p>As she scrambled for solutions, names and ideas scanned like an imaginary checklist before her- The one boy stuck out in her mind the most. Agatha’s shadow, the one she was seen as a mentor for. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Billy. William. Ugh, whatever name that kid goes by! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio panicked, searching for her phone that was snug in her pocket. She whipped it out, searching the list of contacts that almost felt never ending. For an introvert, Rio had collected a variety of people over the years. To be fair, she never spent energy deleting numbers either. </p><p> </p><p>Luckily, Billy was listed under Kaplan- It was easier for Rio to put him in as that. She silently thanked letting him take her phone that Christmas party to put it in. It was rare they texted. Only if he had a question or needed help with the printer and no one else was available. </p><p> </p><p>She hit the call button, bringing it up to her ear as it started to ring, thinking shortly to herself-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> You better fucking answer, little shit. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Right as the few rings hit voicemail, Rio was about to end it when it was cut off with a panicked voice. </p><p> </p><p>“Professor Vidal?” He answered, stammering over his words. “Uh, you’ve never called me befor- I mean, yeah okay- Hello, how are”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha with you?” She asked, impatience making her tone clipped- words short. </p><p> </p><p>“Uhhh, no?” He replied in a questioning tone. “Why? Is she okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, just dandy-” Rio sighed, ignoring the concern in his tone. “What’s her address?” </p><p> </p><p>He was silent for a second. “Why?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed, shaking her head as she pinched the bridge of her nose. “Listen, don’t question me. Okay? I’m not in the mood”</p><p> </p><p>The woman knew she always made the boy a bit on edge. Part of her enjoyed that fact, but it wasn’t helping her out at the moment. She needed him to not question, just do as she said. Also Rio wasn’t in the mood for his stuttering and hesitation. </p><p> </p><p>“Billy, William, whatever the hell your name is-”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s whichever! Though I do prefer-”</p><p> </p><p>“Just shut up and give me her damn address before I kick your scrawny little ass” </p><p> </p><p>She threatened, sending the young man into a frazzled panic as he rambled on repeat with ‘Yes’ and ‘Sorry’ . Not a minute later, Rio had typed in the address into her GPS. Luckily, Agatha was only about ten minutes away-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Ten?  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>All this time, Agatha lived so close and Rio never knew it. She wasn’t sure how to feel about that, but didn’t have the time to let the fact sink in. </p><p> </p><p>“Are you sure she’s okay, Professor Vidal? I can go over for you if you’d like. I know you two don’t uh, get along the greatest and-”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope, that’s all I needed. See you, Monday” </p><p> </p><p>She ended the phone call, kissing Nicky on the top of his head as she whispered,</p><p>“Hopefully,” She sighed, leaning back to meet his eyes. “I’m doing the right thing” </p><p> </p><p>He pushed forward, licking a quick stripe up her nose. She scrunched her nose in reply, shaking her head with a little smile. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re gross, but..I’ll take that as a yes”</p><p> </p><p>Rio then pushed up on her feet, adjusting her clothes before looking in the mirror. She didn’t look her best, her eyes were tired and the stress, fear she wore was visible. But, it didn’t matter.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I have to see her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She could only hope Agatha would want to see her as well. </p><p> </p><hr /><p> </p><p>Rio ran up the flights of stairs, not chancing being caught in an elevator. It didn’t matter to her if she had to make it up to the fifth floor, breathless and winded by the time she had read the number-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “505”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She took in a deep breath, hands on her hips while taking a step back. As her heart steadied itself the best it could with the situation she was in- Rio started to rehearse what she would say.</p><p> </p><p><em> Wait..what do I even say? </em> </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Shit.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t thought that far ahead. She was acting on impulse, every move she made uncalculated and didn’t hold a plan of its own by any means. Normally, Rio was always well ahead of schedule and knew precisely her every move. <br /><br />For the first time in her life, Rio was without guidance. She was off a cliff, hanging by a few fingers for dear life. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Hey Agatha- No, too casual.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha, I’m sorry- For what? What if that isn’t even the problem here? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I love you, Ag- No. Too straight forward, creepy. She’d never say that back. Not now, at least. Right? Right.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha, I- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The door swung open, cutting off Rio’s inner rehearsal of trial and errors. Agatha was holding a bit of cash in one hand, still dressed in Rio’s clothes from barely an hour ago. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio?” Agatha asked, confusion written all over her. “What..how did you-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grip slipped off the cliff, free falling into the atmosphere with no harness to steady the fall. She was completely on her own. No rehearsal, script or plan. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Here goes nothing. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Perk of terrifying the shit out of Kaplan” Rio shrugged with a tremble of a smile. “Can squeeze information out of him pretty uh..easily”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused, looking her up and down. She folded the cash back up, shoving it in her pocket before crossing her arms. Rio’s lips opened to say something else, but Agatha was having none of it. </p><p> </p><p>It didn’t take a rocket scientist to know, </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She’s pissed.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>“Is now a good time?” Rio rubbed the back of her neck, teetering back and forth on her feet. “Mid crisis and all?”</p><p> </p><p>“What are you tal- <em> Oh.. </em>yeah,” Agatha remembered her lie, clearing her throat as she stood a bit taller. “I- Actually, no. Not really. I’ll see you later, k?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped back, her hand on the edge of the door as it started to shut in Rio’s face. The older woman acted on a whim, not thinking as she lunged forward. One hand pressed under the peephole, her foot jammed between the doorframe and the door itself. </p><p> </p><p>She silently thanked Agatha wasn’t too pissed off to slam the door shut. That would’ve hurt, but..not as much as it would if Rio fucked this all up. </p><p> </p><p>“No, Rio-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, wait” Rio cut her off. </p><p> </p><p>Her voice was breathless, still caught in a panic. She looked at Agatha with her eyes wide, pleading for one more minute- Just a second chance at fixing the mess she made of them. </p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Agatha’s anger softened. However, that only lasted for less than a millisecond. She hardened back up, a shell impossible to crack as she sternly ordered, </p><p> </p><p>“Spit it out” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze, a statue solidified by Agatha’s stare as if she was Medusa herself. She took slow heavy breaths, gawking at her with no words to be said. <br /><br />Agatha’s anger held no patience for it. She simply rolled her eyes, kicking Rio’s foot away as she spoke-</p><p> </p><p>“K’, goodbye Ri-”</p><p> </p><p>“No, Agatha!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was desperate, terrified of letting Agatha go and losing everything they had discovered. Her life had changed drastically in less than a month. Agatha Harkness went from her enemy to a woman she couldn’t phantom spending her life without. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Now or never.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I could never hate you. Not after knowing how…” </p><p> </p><p>She swallowed the lump in her throat, terrified to say the words- unsure of where to go. </p><p> </p><p>“How?” Agatha pressed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio took in a deep breath, shaking her head as she barely said above a whisper,</p><p> </p><p>“How good it feels to let myself not hate you..” </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Just say you love her, idiot. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Why is it so hard to say those three words? They were true! Stupidly, fucking, true. Rio couldn’t deny it any longer. Even if she tried to do so, there’d be a huge sign on her forward in all capitals that said <em> “LIAR”  </em></p><p> </p><p>“Why aren’t you hating-”</p><p> </p><p>“Because I’m too busy fucking loving you, Agatha” </p><p> </p><p>The confession came out rough, tense- panicked and frightened all at once. She looked down for a split moment, waiting a bit before peaking back up in fear. Agatha hadn’t said anything, but wore a look of shock stronger than Rio’s. </p><p> </p><p>Rio swore she could hear both of their hearts banging, threatening to break out of their skin and bones to grab onto one another. Was that a good or bad thing? She wasn’t sure of the answer to that question quite yet. </p><p> </p><p>Finally after a few moments that felt like eternity, Agatha slowly nodded. She didn’t clear her throat, leaving her voice cracking as she spoke, </p><p> </p><p>“That's a bold statement, Vidal” </p><p> </p><p>Rio puffed out a small bit of air with a little smile. Even as the tension was so strong that not even a bullet would be able to break through it- Rio felt a bit of relief. Agatha hadn’t slammed the door in her face or looked disgusted. </p><p> </p><p>Which only begged the question- <em> Could she actually feel the same? </em></p><p> </p><p>She shook the thought out of her mind, finding her footing to speak once again.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well..” She said, looking down as she whispered, “Pretty bold of you to ruin my life”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha puffed out a laugh. “Oh, that is such a <em> lovely </em>thing to follow up with after such a confession”</p><p> </p><p>What Rio didn’t hear in Agatha’s voice through those words? The sound of relief. </p><p> </p><p>She had no idea that night when Agatha’s fingers buried themselves inside of her for the first time- She almost said it. Agatha was so close to breaking first, speaking words neither thought would be said by either of them to each other. </p><p> </p><p>“Only the truth..” Rio shrugged. </p><p> </p><p>“Explain yourself” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushed, trying to strengthen her voice back to being strict. Even if it was a weak attempt, it was enough to strike fear into Rio. </p><p> </p><p>“How do you manage to fall in love with someone who ruined your life, hm?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused. </p><p> </p><p><em> Yeah, how the fuck did you? </em>She asked herself. </p><p> </p><p>The woman waved that question away, sent it flying to only come back later and smack her in the back of the head. For now, she needed to think quick- Go by instinct, not let hesitation and fear silence her. </p><p> </p><p>“Because..” Rio said, taking a few seconds before adding a small, “I never knew how good being ruined could be” </p><p> </p><p>For a lingering moment, one that spread past thirty seconds- Neither said anything. There was no movement, word, barely a breath to be heard. </p><p> </p><p>The silence made Rio doubt everything. <em> Ruined. </em>That was such a stupid word. Maybe Agatha took it the wrong way, the true meaning and definition of it. The opposite of what Rio was trying to say. If she did, Rio couldn’t necessarily blame her. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> No, no- </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I-”</p><p> </p><p>The woman gasped as her collar was yanked forward. She felt her feet lift off the floor, body being pulled through the threshold before pressed up against the back of the door- feeling it slam shut behind her. </p><p> </p><p>She barely had time to breathe before her body was pulled forward again- This time, with lips pressed against her own. Rio nearly melted in Agatha’s grip, following like a lost puppy as she took every step the woman guided. Their lips barely parted, firm and rough- moving in harmony as they traveled down the hall-</p><p> </p><p><em> Hallway? Maybe? Fuck. I’ll look to see the layout of this place after. </em>Rio told herself. </p><p> </p><p>Right then, Rio gave Agatha complete control. She allowed herself to be guided, pulled, and tossed right onto the bed without any grace. </p><p> </p><p>She rolled over onto her back, panting as she gazed at the woman above. Agatha was taking heavy breaths, running a hand through her hair as she took slow strides closer and closer- Almost a predator circling in on their prey.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed up on her elbows. A little smirk grew as she swiped her tongue on the inside of her cheek. </p><p> </p><p>“Not even gonna’ give me the tour first?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, shaking her head as she knelt down on the bed. </p><p> </p><p>Her hands pressed into the mattress on either side of Rio’s hips, slowly hovering over her. The long hair created a wall on either side of Rio’s face, forcing her to only see the beauty above- </p><p> </p><p>Not that she needed to be forced to do that. Agatha was the only sight on Rio’s radar right then (And always). </p><p> </p><p>The woman leaned down, their noses brushed together- Lips almost touching only for her to pull back as she asked,</p><p> </p><p>“Do you trust me to <em> ruin </em> you even more?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio took a second before letting out a soft laugh, shaking her head. “Not possible”</p><p> </p><p>She shrugged, lifting one hand to pull at Agatha’s collar before maneuvering it down- ready to strip her own hoodie right off of her. Rio made sure their eyes stayed locked together, never parting as she whispered, </p><p> </p><p>“Already fell for my stupid, annoying, worst enemy. How could I possibly-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t let the woman finish her words. She shoved her back on the bed, Rio’s elbows gave out and her head smacked into the pillows. Before she could reach out to bring Agatha with her- She was off the bed and stripping off the hoodie. </p><p> </p><p>Rio whined out a small, “I wanted to do that”</p><p> </p><p>The woman heard a little scoff, but wasn’t sure if it actually happened. Agatha paid no mind as she rummaged through her dresser. </p><p> </p><p>She was topless, only in sweatpants- giving Rio time to admire her back. Toned muscles were decorated by freckles and faded red claw marks from the nights before. Her mouth was dry, yet drool was not far from the horizon either. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was about to speak when Agatha spun around, holding two things that made her stomach flip and drop- heart stop while oxygen ceased to exist.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>In her hands as Agatha slowly made her way back to the bed was something Rio had subtly imagined about, but never dared to voice. She had never asked for such a thing, only ever was the one to use it on another woman. </p><p> </p><p>The black harness was in one hand, purple dildo in the other. </p><p> </p><p><em> ..Fuck, fuck- Fuck? Fuck. </em>Rio’s mind chanted. </p><p> </p><p>Even with how struck with lust she was, excited and turned on unlike ever before- Rio wasn’t one to give in. Not that easy, anyway. </p><p> </p><p>She smirked, pushing back up on her elbows with a pathetic scoff. </p><p> </p><p>“You really think you can ruin me with that?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Because, you can. Oh. You so fucking can.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha simply smiled, placing the items down on the bed as she crawled over her once again. This time, she dipped down to push Rio’s hoodie up- her lips graced the soft skin of her abdomen. Gentle kisses, little licks that went higher and higher until she hit Rio’s sports bra underneath. </p><p> </p><p>She pushed the bra up, bringing Rio on the verge of whimpering- waiting for Agatha’s lips to grace her sensitive nipples that were expecting her. </p><p> </p><p>But the tease she was? Rio shouldn’t have been surprised when she simply pulled away with a little grin. </p><p> </p><p>“Ag-”</p><p> </p><p>“You doubt me, huh?” Agatha questioned.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was taking heavy breaths, eyebrows furrowed as she shook her head. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wha- Oh. Ruined. Right.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah” She lied (Even Rio knew how pathetic she sounded). </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked, hands pulling away from her skin completely. Rio restrained a whine from losing her touch, but was helped by Agatha caressing her cheek instead. It wasn’t exactly where she wanted her, but..Rio would take what she could get. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s cute..” Agatha said, eyes admiring Rio’s lips. </p><p> </p><p>She let her thumb run across her bottom one, pulling it down gently- barely being able to make her own move because Rio had beat her to it. </p><p> </p><p>Her tongue slipped underneath the tip of her thumb, dragging it back as if she had a cord wrapped around the digit. Rio’s lips sealed shut, tongue swirling slowly around Agatha’s thumb- warm, wet, beautiful against her skin. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha struggled to contain her moan over the sight, shaking her head- snapping herself out of the trance to keep her control the best she could. </p><p> </p><p>“Do you trust me?” She asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her thumb slip away, letting go with an exaggerated <em> ‘pop’ </em>as she nodded with no hesitation. </p><p> </p><p>“I won't be upset you don't, Rio. I can assure you tha-”</p><p> </p><p>“Ruin me, Harkness” Rio encouraged. “Or, are you scared of just being all talk and no sh-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned, shaking her head as she roughly grabbed her hips- lifting them up to yank down Rio’s waistband of her leggings. The woman below couldn’t hold back a small laugh, feeling her legs exposed to the cool air, not caring where Agatha had tossed her bottoms to.</p><p> </p><p>She reached out to grab onto Agatha’s waistband, ready to discard her's. But, a firm grip on her wrist pushed Rio back. Before she knew it, both hands were pinned against the pillow above her head, Agatha’s face just a few inches away. </p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, lips parted as her pupils dilated. Agatha didn’t look tender and sweet. There wasn’t the same care, begging and asking for trust anymore. </p><p> </p><p>The devil was above her. </p><p>The woman she put through for three years being her enemy was ready to get her revenge. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha may have fucked her before, but Rio knew right then? She was fucked seven ways to Sunday and then some. </p><p> </p><p>“You will move when I say you move” </p><p><br />Her voice was dark, raspy, filled with an edge that cut Rio to the core in the best way. </p><p> </p><p>“You will speak when I tell you to” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s leg lifted, prying itself between Rio’s legs. Before she knew it, the soft fabric of Agatha’s sweatpants pressed against the outside of her bare cunt (Or..her sweatpants? God. Rio didn’t even know. Whoever they belonged to, the fabric was already ruined). </p><p> </p><p>She made a soft sound, an echo of a whimper through a gasp as her back arched off the bed over the pressure. </p><p> </p><p>“And you..” Agatha leaned down, smirking right as her nose brushed against Rio’s. Lips barely touching as she whispered. “You will remember that I fucking love you too”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shivered, swallowing the lump in her throat- One built with nerves and disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved her. </p><p>She loved Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>And suddenly, in what felt like a blink of an eye- <em> We aren’t enemies anymore..fuck. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Sound like a deal?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared, unable to respond. Agatha didn’t wait a minute to clear her throat before adding on,</p><p> </p><p>“Rio. I asked you a ques-”</p><p> </p><p>“I love you too”</p><p> </p><p>The words caught Rio off guard just as they did with Agatha. Both of their eyes widened, a deep flush of warmth burnt Rio’s skin- Embarrassment making her shy into herself as Agatha let go with a little laugh.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded, flipping her hair back with a little wink,</p><p> </p><p>“Take that as a yes”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha then leaned down to gently pull Rio into a kiss. One delicate, distracting as Rio subtly felt Agatha take her hand and guide it down her own body. Rio gasped into the kiss the second her fingers felt the soaked tangle of hair, remembering the words like she would every single time. </p><p> </p><p>The second night they spent together, Rio had whispered an apology she forgot to shave once again. Any other woman she dated or slept with was one to cringe from any stubble of hair- Something Rio never felt completely comfortable with. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha? She simply smirked, whispering a soft,</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Honey, the hair on your body is the last thing on my mind. The only thing I’m thinking about is fucking you, tasting you, so much more” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Maybe to someone else, the words would have been meaningless. Rio shouldn’t have felt so self conscious over something so small. However, it meant more than anything else. </p><p> </p><p>The rest of that night, Agatha had worshipped and devoured her. Little whispers of adoration, reassurance Rio never had to hide or feel embarrassed by any inch of her skin. </p><p> </p><p><em> She loved me then. Fuck. How could I have been so blind to this? </em>Rio wondered. </p><p>That was the last rambling thought she had as her fingertips slipped between her folds, feeling her arousal soak not only her fingers- But Agatha’s that rested on top of her own. </p><p> </p><p>Both sighed into the kiss before pulling apart. Agatha pushed Rio’s middle finger to slip by, circling around once before rubbing a quick swipe over her clit. Rio whimpered, jolting at the strike of pleasure that coursed through her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rubbed Rio’s clit with her, slowly, not in any kind of rush. It lasted for a moment, something that felt far too quick for Rio to fully comprehend before she pulled back. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand went to follow, but Agatha pushed her back to where she left her. Middle finger pressed on her clit, not letting off as she ordered, </p><p> </p><p>“Continue with that” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushed up and off Rio’s body. She stood at the edge of the bed, grabbing the harness with a little smirk. </p><p> </p><p>“C’mon now, Professor..” She said. “You’re not dumb”</p><p><br />With her mind becoming fuzzy, clouded and overwhelmed with crazed thoughts. She nearly wanted to scream out for Agatha to fuck her. It distracted her till the realization hit-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Oh. Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio started to rub small circles on her clit, pulling her bottom lip between her teeth to muffle the little sounds that would scream out louder than they threatened to. Another thought entered her mind. A short one that made her brain short circuit, all wires sparking into flames-</p><p> </p><p>She was slowly fucking herself while watching as Agatha pulled the strap on up, adjusting it with the harness. </p><p> </p><p>She was fucking herself watching Agatha prepare to fuck her. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> What happened to us being enemies? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio admired the dildo that now hung between Agatha’s legs, unsure if the seven inches (So Rio took a shot in the dark over) was hotter- Or the fact the strap on was over Agatha’s sweatpants, not bothering to spend the few seconds it’d take to strip them. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Jesus.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood back, her eyes stuck in a trance as she watched Rio’s finger move slowly. Her hand moved up to run through her hair, the other had her fingers wrapped around the base of the strap, rubbing just softly- enough to drive Rio to the edge of losing it. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha” Rio whispered. </p><p> </p><p>The woman above smirked, moving forward to kneel back on the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Hm?” She hummed, hands rubbing up her thighs. “Tell me, how does that feel” </p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled, shaking her head. “Not enough” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Figured as much”</p><p> </p><p>She pulled Rio’s hand away, lifting it to her lips- Not spending a second to wait before licking along her skin. Rio gasped as her fingers slipped between Agatha’s lips, feeling her tongue swipe and swirl every inch, cleaning off the mess she made all over them. </p><p> </p><p>A few seconds later, Agatha pulled them out with a low hum. She smiled, leaning down to whisper against Rio’s stomach-</p><p> </p><p>“Need more” </p><p> </p><p>Before she lowered, leaving kisses along the inside of Rio’s thighs- taking her sweet time which frustrated the hell out of the other woman. </p><p> </p><p>“Come on-”</p><p> </p><p>“Nope,” Agatha tisked, shaking her head as she looked back up. “You don’t get to rush me-”</p><p> </p><p>“But-”</p><p> </p><p>“Three years,” Agatha said. “You made me wait that long. Think you can manage to hold on for me just for a bit, Rio”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed. “Not fai-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha silenced her with a light smack on her thigh, enough to sting but not leave a mark. </p><p> </p><p>“Did I tell you to speak?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snickered. “You didn’t shut up for those three years so why- No. <em> No, </em>Agatha-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, trying to hide how amused and the way she adored Rio like this. The most stubborn professor was such a brat, a sarcastic thing that became grouchy just from not getting what she wanted asap.</p><p> </p><p>She pushed up as Rio spoke, standing to her feet as she reached down- grabbing Rio’s leggings. Not a second later did Rio stammer into a string of her name, pushing up on her elbows as her eyes begged for her to come back. </p><p> </p><p>The woman looked back with a small smirk, shaking her head as she rasped, “You done being a brat?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed with a small frown, narrowed eyes with a shake of her head. “You’re evil”</p><p> </p><p>“And you’re desperate” Agatha tossed the leggings aside, going back to her as she grinned. “Aren’t you, dear?”</p><p> </p><p><em> Yes. </em>Rio thought to herself, but she wasn’t giving in that easy. </p><p> </p><p>She collected herself, shaking her head as she sped the words off, “Three years, like you said…not that desperate clearly”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused, staring at her before a little laugh. “Right..”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded, bending down to push her legs open with a silent whistle. </p><p> </p><p>“Mm,” She hummed, rubbing her hand over the folds- dipping two fingers to slide through them, smirking when Rio’s hips lifted to chase her. “You feel pretty desperate..<em> soaking </em>desperate”  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha brought her fingers up, snickering as Rio’s lips parted without an order. She slipped them along the woman’s tongue, letting Rio taste herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me, darling. Do you think you taste desperate?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brain short circuited more than before as Agatha slid her fingers back out. She didn’t get a chance to reply as her fingertips thrusted inside for a millisecond before back out. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes locked with Rio’s, slipping the same fingers between her own lips- humming at the taste she’d never grow tired of. </p><p> </p><p>“God,” She rasped. “You taste more than desperate than seconds ago” She laughed. “Wouldn’t you agree, Professor?”</p><p>Rio was speechless, broken, on the verge of being ruined and Agatha had barely even touched her yet. Agatha seemed to be thinking the same as she laughed, </p><p> </p><p>“Haven’t even buried my fingers,” She pushed her fingers back against her cunt, leaning down slowly. “Or my strap in you…” She added. </p><p> </p><p>Just when she hovered above, barely more than a few centimeters away from her face- Agatha whispered, “And you’re fucking speechless” </p><p> </p><p>Rio whimpered, earning a soft laugh from Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“Think you can do as I say now, Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha won. Rio couldn’t put up a fight or challenge. She was spent, desperate, a burning desire for more. </p><p> </p><p>“What do you say?” Agatha whispered. “What do I want to hear? Come on, baby. You know-”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Fuck me, professor” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed with a smile. Rio had said it twice before, but with the new found confession- A future in front of them- It was different. Even better because Agatha had always called her the little name, never the reverse. </p><p><br />And the context Agatha was able to hear her own nickname from the other woman in? <em> She could die. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Good girl” Agatha kissed her cheek before moving down. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed down her stomach, along inner thighs for multiple painful minutes. Rio tried to control her temper, on the verge of pulling Agatha’s face to where she needed her most.</p><p> </p><p>Finally after close to seven minutes, Agatha graced her  by licking a small stripe, barely enough to apply pressure on her clit. She pulled away with a hum- diving back in to press a firm kiss against her clit, dipping her tongue inside a second after, nose bumping against her clit at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t restrain the loud whine, biting down on her knuckles while her other hand grasped the bedsheets. </p><p><br />Agatha completely forgot about her fingers, too lost in the beautiful taste. Sweet, sultry, a taste that drove her off the deep end more than anything else ever could. Only when Rio’s fingers tangled in her hair, a soft cry that barely uttered the word-</p><p> </p><p><em> “More” </em>did she remember. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled her head back, smiling as Rio whined with a  shake of her head. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha- Ple-”</p><p> </p><p>The beg was turned into a cry as Agatha slipped her middle finger in. Her walls soft, tight, sucking her in as if Agatha was the medicine she needed to not die in that moment. </p><p> </p><p>Barely a few seconds later did she replace one with two, then after two with three. Rio thrashed beneath her, a combination of moans and gasps- Uttered words mixed with Spanish and English both. Agatha noted she needed to study Spanish to pick up on what Rio was saying, but that was for the future. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t wait much longer, unsure if it was too soon for Rio or not. She’d ask, make sure of it beforehand even if it killed her. But <em> fuck, </em> she needed more. <em> So much more. </em></p><p> </p><p>“Think you’re ready for me, baby?” Agatha asked. </p><p><br />Rio whimpered, hips thrusted up that brought out a little laugh from Agatha. She slid her fingers out, ripping a whine of complaint out of the other woman. Agatha shushed her softly as she crawled back over her, tapping her lips with her fingertips to open. </p><p> </p><p>As Rio sucked off her fingers, their eyes locked together- never parting for a second. Agatha whispered,</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so fucking beautiful, Aggravatingly beautiful”</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t stop the little chuckle, letting Agatha’s fingers slip away as she replied, “And I’m the one with insults”</p><p> </p><p>“Not an insult when it’s just the truth, idiot”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, a warm one with a bit of lust growing beneath it. She reached down to hold the base of the strap, inching forward before leaning back.</p><p> </p><p>“Shit,” She cursed. “Let me grab some lube. I don’t want you to feel uncomfo-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands shot up to grip her forearms, shaking her head. </p><p> </p><p>“I don’t need it” She assured. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha frowned. “But, I-”</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you were going to ruin me, hm?” Rio pushed a piece of Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “Or is mi amor too soft for that now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly died at the two words. <em> Mi amor. </em> Rio had only said it once before. It was in passing on the way to work that morning. Agatha knew she hadn’t even realized her words, never explaining what they meant. She ended up Googling it in the car before heading inside. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Dinner tonight at yours?” Agatha asked, adjusting her bag over her shoulder.  </em>
</p><p><em> <br /></em> <em> Rio nodded as she rushed over from the door to peck her lips, whispering a soft, “Have a good day mi amor”  </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha watched her rush out the front door, a silent agreement they left a few minutes apart. She stood dumbfounded, eyes wide with her lips still tingling from the kiss. Two words cycled and tossed like a dryer did with clothes in her mind,  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Mi amor.. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I swear-” Rio scoffed. “Just fuck me already. God, you’re insufferable” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused before a laugh. “She loves me, trusts me, and insults me throughout it all. How’d a woman like me get so lucky?”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I swea- <em> Fuck”  </em></p><p> </p><p>She pushed the tip of the strap in just as Rio went to argue, silencing her into a moan. Not a second later did Agatha pull away, smirking as Rio punched the bed beneath her. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a bitch” Rio muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, what was that?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>“I said you are such a-<em> Mmph!”  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha repeated the same motion, but this time the strap went farther than just the tip- staying still as she watched Rio bite back her lips, silencing herself completely. </p><p> </p><p>“What? Cat got your tongue?” Agatha feigned a pout, lips pursed as she tilted her head. “Nothing more to add, dear?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whispered something under her breath, looking to the side as she pushed her hips up. Agatha though had a strong grip, forcing them back down leaving her unable to move. </p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t hear that” Agatha tisked. “Try again” </p><p> </p><p>The woman below groaned, shaking her head before locking her eyes with Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>“I said…<em> fuck me already” </em>She ordered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, inching the strap in a tiny bit more. Her hands roamed up to push Rio’s hoodie- making it rest above her breasts, leaving them bare and exposed just as Agatha’s were. </p><p> </p><p>She slowly pushed more and more, giving Rio time to adjust or stop if she needed her to do so. However, Rio only whimpered and moaned more. Her lips parted, jaw ajar as she closed her eyes- Agatha was having none of that though. </p><p> </p><p>She grasped Rio’s chin, shaking her head with a click of her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>“Eyes open or I stop, Rio”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate to obey, following her words without a fight. And <em> fuck, </em>Agatha would never grow tired of that. </p><p> </p><p>Just as their eyes locked, the strap fit like a glove- sucked in and melted them into one. Rio’s nails sunk into Agatha’s skin, holding tighter as she felt a flood of need cry out- unable to vocalize it completely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t warn, she didn’t ask this time around- her hips pulled away achingly slow before snapping back with a force that made Rio’s need to cry out make noise. Her back arched, nails dug deeper as she started to babble off a plea,</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, please, please- I-”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, baby..” Agatha whispered. “I’m gonna’ fuck you..ruin you for just me only, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Her hips sped up only a sliver, barely enough to scratch the itch that only increased. She smiled as Rio’s head tilted back. Waves of power, desire, a crazed need flooded and drowned her. Agatha barely said anything else before her hips thrusted more, deeper, faster- becoming a pace that could only be described as ruthless. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t extremely vocal in bed, well- Beforehand, that was. Agatha was the loud one with screams and dramatic moans. Rio was whimpers, soft whines and hushed words. Not this time. <em> Holy fuck, not this time.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha was driven crazy with every moan that grew louder and louder, Rio begging in chants that could be compared to mantras. She’d joke later on it felt like Rio was trying to cast a spell, pull her into magic that’d control her completely. </p><p> </p><p>If that was real though? Agatha would gratefully accept it. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m…<em> Mierda, mierda-” </em></p><p> </p><p><em> Fuck. </em>Agatha had looked up the meaning for that one after their first night together. She learned early on Rio would chant that like one word like a prayer. </p><p> </p><p>“Gonna’ come for me, baby? Huh?” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, gasping and on the verge before Agatha was a witch of her own kind-</p><p>
  <em> “FUCK!”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio cried out as Agatha pulled out in a swift motion, leaving her bare and empty before she was able to tip over the edge. She felt her body move away, leaving her to punch the bedsheets with a huff. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” She exclaimed.</p><p><br />Agatha snickered. “Yes, my love?” </p><p> </p><p>“You’re such a bit-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gripped her hoodie, pulling her up to guide her over-</p><p> </p><p>“Hands and knees” She ordered, ignoring Rio’s complaints. “Come on-”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m trying!” </p><p> </p><p><em> Oh, this is good. </em> Agatha laughed in her mind. </p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t edged Rio like this before. In subtle ways, she had, but like this? Ripping her from an orgasm that was so close instead of halfway? Teasing her endlessly beforehand? </p><p>
  <em> Could get used to this.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“This is so stupid” Rio muttered as she did what Agatha told her to do. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, twirling Rio’s hair around her fingers with a slight yet firm tug back to her. She leaned down, lips ghosting Rio’s ear with a whisper,</p><p> </p><p>“Wanna’ say that again?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, shaking her head frantically. </p><p> </p><p>“No, baby. Please. I just want you so bad and I- I- <em> Oh!”  </em></p><p> </p><p>She cried out as Agatha lined the tip of the dildo to her cunt, pushing in- This time, she didn’t ease or tease. A strong, quick, punch through her like a cannon. She didn’t wait either to start thrusting her hips- A stronger pace than before. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s moans were stronger. A sobbing sound that cried out for Agatha only. At a volume the neighbors would certainly complain about. Neither would care, they’d both laugh and Agatha would point out that’s why they needed to fuck at Rio’s. </p><p> </p><p><em> “We can get Nicky earmuffs” </em>Agatha would smirk as Rio rolled her eyes. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Don’t! I don’t want him to know-”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “That you’re a slut for me?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “...I hate you” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Anyway, take your clothes off”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled Rio’s hair back again, smiling like a mad woman as drool with dripping down her chin. She chuckled, unable to hold back a little tease. </p><p> </p><p>“Drooling for me, baby?” She asked. “Oh, this is new..and to think- You tried saying you weren’t desperate. Just a beautiful slut, crying out on my-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio screamed out, gripping the pillow as body started to pulse. She felt fire burn every piece of her. A blinding white that took over her eyes, blinding her vision as she could only focus on the pleasure shaking her to the core. </p><p>Her walls tightened, almost making it impossible for Agatha to continue thrusting through. </p><p> </p><p>She tensed, muscles trembling and weak- only being held up by Agatha’s grip on her hair. Agatha took advantage of Rio growing weak by pulling the woman up against her front. An arm wrapped around her waist while the one in her hair moved to grasp her throat. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t stop thrusting up in her. This time it was slower, but deeper- letting Rio ride through her orgasm that felt never ending. </p><p> </p><p>“Coming so hard for me” Agatha whispered blindly, finding Rio’s hand to press over her lower abdomen. The little bump pushed against her palm. “Feel that, honey?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio whined, nodding with another moan slipped between. </p><p> </p><p>“Good. Don’t move till you come again for me- This time,” Agatha held her throat tighter with one hand, pressing Rio’s palm against her skin harder with the other. “Wait till I tell you to come, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>She nodded, pathetic moans with little words slurred along. Ones neither could make sense of. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved fucking Rio past one orgasm into the next. It never took as long as the first, a rush of excitement, a flood of anticipation and the need to feel the same sensation all over again. </p><p> </p><p>The woman held her tighter, the bump against Rio’s palm rising up and down multiple times over. Agatha made sure her hand stayed while her own rubbed over the patch of hair that was sticky and soaked. Her fingers slipped down, groaning as she felt the mess that was sure leaving running marks down her thighs- most likely soaking the bedsheets below. </p><p> </p><p>“God, Rio” Agatha gasped. “I’m- <em> Fuck” </em></p><p> </p><p>The base of the harness was bumping against Agatha’s clothed cover clit with every thrust. A pressure that weighed heavier with every thrust. Holding Rio in her arms, fucking her to the point she was screaming in her ear louder than ever before. On top of it all, knowing Rio was hers completely. </p><p> </p><p>Rio loved her. Rio fucking <em> loved </em>her. That thought alone was enough to send Agatha into a crashing orgasm of her own. </p><p><br />Her plan was to hold off a bit longer, make Rio wait- But, she couldn’t. Not when her own tsunami of pleasure was about to take control. </p><p> </p><p>“Come with me, mi amor” Rio rasped, her free hand raised up to hold the side of Agatha’s face. </p><p> </p><p>Their heads were held together, bodies moving in harmony. An image that was pornographic, erotic, and beautiful more than anything else. It was an omen, a sign of the duo they were always meant to be. Not two enemies at odds, just lovers entangled and perfectly built for each other. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m supposed to be telling you when-” </p><p><br />Rio pressed back the best she could, enough to press the strap harder against Agatha’s clit. She smiled, a love drunk one as Agatha started to moan against her ear. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m..Ri- <em> Rio </em>” </p><p> </p><p>Both of them held tight onto one another as if they were bracing for a world ending storm. Both cried out in sync, a duet with the same tone, singing out for each other. They became lost in a swirl of chaos, a spiral that brought them down onto the bed. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was beneath Agatha who laid on top of her. Both spent, breathless, weak. Their bodies shivered through the aftershocks, taking time to settle and make sense of what just happened. </p><p> </p><p>Rio loved the weight of Agatha on top. The dildo, a piece of Agatha, was still stuffed deep inside of her. The bedsheet was rough against her clit, pressing against the bunched up part of it. She wasn’t sure if Agatha would laugh, find her weird or too needy, but <em> fuck- </em></p><p> </p><p>After that? With Agatha’s own orgasm still in her mind, how it felt to come in sync with her? </p><p> </p><p>Rio maneuvered her hips, letting the bedsheet weakly rub against her clit. It took a few moments for Agatha to come out of her daze, catch on to Rio below. She smirked, choking back a moan as she reached forward to hold the pillows. </p><p> </p><p>“Not enough for you, huh?” </p><p><br />The woman jumped, only able to babble out a soft whine. Agatha nodded more to herself, finding strength to thrust weak, slow, but enough to press back into the spot that drove Rio wild. They shuffled, slowly swayed against the bed together. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t intense pleasure like before, but enough with how sensitive Agatha had left Rio to make an impact. Especially as Agatha pushed a piece of hair back to whisper against Rio’s ear. </p><p> </p><p>“Wanted you to love me for so long”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, unable to form words of her own as she listened to her. </p><p> </p><p>“Made me your fucking enemy,” She rasped. “Now everyone will know that was all an act. This is all you wanted, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>She felt the third orgasm approaching, so close she could taste it. Agatha bit her earlobe, thrusting a bit harder- The words she spoke, final ones that pushed Rio over the edge completely would be her new favorite ones to always hear. </p><p> </p><p>“God, Rio. I love you”</p><p> </p><p>Right then, Rio crashed all over again. She was suffocated by her moans, controlled and dictated by her body. </p><p> </p><p>Aka, body also and probably more defined by- <em> Agatha. </em></p><p> </p><p>After a few minutes, Rio’s body stopped shivering. Agatha waited till her breathing wasn’t so rapid, whispering a soft warning before she slowly pulled the strap from her. It was soaked, covered in Rio’s cum. Agatha would lose her mind at the thought of Rio sucking every part of it off, but that was for another time. </p><p><br />For now, she pulled it from the harness, putting it aside. Agatha didn’t spend time taking the harness off. She was too eager to hold Rio close, whisper soft praises and promises to love her forever.  </p><p> </p><p>But first?</p><p> </p><p>“Do my eyes deceive me, or have I ruined you <em> Professor? </em>” Agatha asked. </p><p> </p><p>Rio took a second, flipping over to lay on her back as Agatha was on her side- head propped up with her hand, elbow rested on the mattress. </p><p> </p><p>She smirked down at her, rubbing her free hand over Rio’s torso. Her fingertips delicately tracing random patterns, letter that spelled out a mix of-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I love you </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Mine </em>
</p><p>
  <em> You’re annoying. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“More ways than one. That’s official” Rio answered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed with a small smile. </p><p> </p><p>“So…you didn’t mean what you said in your kitchen?”</p><p><br />Rio snapped her head over, eyes wide as she shook her head. “No. That’s what I came here to tell you”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed. “Yeah, you told me alright. Three orgasms worthy of an explanation”</p><p> </p><p>The woman beside her groaned, smacking her shoulder before turning to bury herself in Agatha’s chest. She let out a warm laugh, wrapping her arm around her- kissing the top of Rio’s head with a soft sigh. </p><p> </p><p>They stayed like that for quite awhile. Just Rio buried in her hold, Agatha making sure to never let her go. Even if her back was strained, arm falling asleep beneath her head- All of it. Nothing mattered. They could stay in that spot till they died and Agatha would be happy with her end. </p><p> </p><p>However, Rio was the one to break their silence- whispering a soft, muffled against Agatha’s skin,</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad you don’t hate me” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, holding back the tears that started to gloss over her eyes. She held her closer, whispering against her skull a soft,</p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad you’re done hating me” </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate to reply, </p><p> </p><p>“I never really did…”</p><p>
