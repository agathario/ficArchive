      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Agatha Harkness is back in Westview. Newly divorced. Working nights. She didn’t expect to see Rio Vidal again. Then again, she never really knew what to do with her in the first place.</p><p>-</p><p>There’s no rule against running into someone you haven’t spoken to in ten years and realizing nothing about them has changed except their hair and the exact angle of the knife they twist in your gut.</p><p>Agatha’s fine.</p><p>Agatha’s not mad.</p><p>She just wants to know who the fuck decided to keep that particular bit of very fucking important information classified.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello gays, it’s me, ya boi.</p><p>Before we get into it, a few things: if you’re here from my coffins fic-love you, always. I fought so hard not to write my OC from coffins into this… and I lost. She’s in it. That said, her relationship to Agathario isn’t the same in this one, but I missed MY FAMILY and couldn’t not bring her back.</p><p>Also, I got this idea after watching Platonic with Seth Rogen and by that I mean this has nothing to do with the show except that Agatha and Rio were never more than platonic… sorta… at least physically… you’ll see.</p><p>And lastly, let the record show: I am a huge Wanda Maximoff fan. I love her. But for the purpose of this fic, she is not a great person. Please don’t come for me lmaoo.</p><p>Anyway, that’s it. Buckle up. Hope you enjoy the ride.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Night shift… Either people love it or they hate it.</p><p> </p><p>There’s plenty to hate about it, really. It wrecks your sleep cycle, jacks up your risk of cancer, cardiovascular disease, digestive issues. It’s like playing roulette with your internal organs. One especially charming fact? Night shift workers can expect to lose about fifteen years off their lives.</p><p> </p><p>Even with the promise of an early death and digestive ruin, someone still has to clock in anyway.</p><p> </p><p>It’ll probably ruin you. It’ll take years off your life. It’s not healthy, it’s not balanced. But someone has to show up for it. Someone always does.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness fucking loves night shift.</p><p> </p><p>She believes that in a hospital, it’s easily the best shift. Fewer people. Quieter halls. Most of the self righteous day staff disappear when the sun disappears, and the ones who stick around tend to be too tired to keep up the act. Not that it's completely free of obnoxious coworkers, but no job ever is. That’s just the curse of shared oxygen.</p><p> </p><p>And the pay? Delightfully absurd. A few extra dollars an hour to embrace less fluorescent lighting, the occasional spiral into an existential cirsis, and losing the ability to behave like a functioning member of society during the day. Honestly? Bargain.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t love working nights for the pay or to silently push herself toward an early grave.</p><p> </p><p>She loves it because no one gives a damn if she doesn’t smile. There's no pressure to perform, no expectation of charm. She shows up, does her job, and no one asks her to pretend to be someone that she’s not.</p><p> </p><p>There’s this myth that nights are easier. That things settle down. Patients don’t crash, alarms don’t blare, nobody spirals into a medical emergency after the sun goes down.</p><p> </p><p>That couldn’t be further from the truth.</p><p> </p><p>Emergencies don’t clock out. They just get harder to see in the dark.</p><p> </p><p>And on the worst nights, when things really fall apart, there’s always a full moon.</p><p> </p><p>That part isn’t superstition. It’s consistency. A full moon shows up and everything goes to absolute shit. Machines fail for no reason. People get fucking weird. The laws of physics bend out spite.</p><p> </p><p>It’s chaos. Unapologetic and total.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t just handle it. She thrives in it.</p><p> </p><p>Order is fine, in theory. It’s neat. It’s cute. But chaos? It’s messy, brutal, and unpredictable- but it’s real.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is back on nights after over a decade away from them.</p><p> </p><p>She’s also back in Westview.</p><p> </p><p>It’s not a small town- never was. It’s suburbia with too many people, too many intersections, and too many places pretending to be important. The traffic makes no sense, the strip malls all smell vaguely like sweat and fried food, and if there’s a charming side to Westview, it’s buried under a Target, a vape shop, and a mattress store that’s definitely laundering money.</p><p> </p><p>And she loves it.</p><p> </p><p>It’s where she went to college. Where she started over after clawing herself out from under her mother’s roof, her mother’s rules, and her mother’s voice- now, thankfully, all six feet under. Westview was hers before anything else ever was, and she’s not sorry to be back.</p><p> </p><p>Westview was supposed to be permanent. And for a while, it was.</p><p> </p><p>Until Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>They met at a bar. One of those loud, overlit places where everyone’s shouting over each other and the drinks are five dollars too expensive. Wanda had a quick smile and a brilliant mind, and Agatha had been too tired to resist either.</p><p> </p><p>The first year of their relationship, Agatha gave up night shift. She’d been a NICU nurse at St. Rita’s Memorial Hospital straight out of college. She’d built her career on nights and never intended to leave them. But relationships, she reasoned, were about compromise. The second year, they got engaged. Before the end of that year, they were married and relocating to the Windy City so Wanda could step into a shiny new position.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda worked in administration, back when she still remembered what that meant. It obviously didn’t take long for ex-wife to climb. She was good at her job, knew how to play the game. Agatha watched her go from clipboard and sensible heels to executive decisions and boardroom smiles. Somewhere along the way, it changed. Wanda stopped talking about care plans and started talking about cost-efficiency. The person who once fought for nurses was now the reason they were short staffed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t follow her then wife to Chicago because she believed in the dream. She followed her because staying no longer felt like an option. Wanda was certain. She made plans, gave names to things, Agatha never had to translate her silences. And maybe that was the appeal. There were no rules to navigate, no words to interpret.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda’s offer came with just enough forward motion to feel like an escape. It was easier to chase a new zip code than to sit still with everything that wasn’t working. So she packed her life into cardboard boxes, told herself she’d find her footing again, and pretended it didn’t feel like she was leaving a part of herself behind on purpose.</p><p> </p><p>But it’s been long enough.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was home now.</p><p> </p><p>Back at St. Rita’s, working nights as a NICU nurse again, in a hospital that remembers her even if most of the staff doesn’t. The shifts are brutal, the halls are dim, and the chaos is familiar in a way that feels comforting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knows exactly what she signed up for. And this time, she’s not leaving.</p><p> </p><p>That is, until her very first night back on nights.</p><p> </p><p>She’d trained for three months on days, but now she was back where she belonged, elbow deep in chaos at 2:30 a.m., drawing labs on a micro preemie who -judging by the flailing limbs and oxygen desats- was deeply committed to playing patty cake with Jesus anytime Agatha so much as touched his arm. Totally normal behavior for a micro. They hate being messed with, and they make sure you know it.</p><p> </p><p>She’d just finished and was now standing at the bedside computer, charting her victory, when she heard the door to the pod open.</p><p> </p><p>The whirr of the portable x-ray machine was familiar, unremarkable. Both of Agatha’s babies had morning x-rays ordered, so she didn’t bother turning around. The tech would need time to set up, and she needed to wrap up her charting. It was routine. Normal. Nothing she hadn’t done a billion times before.</p><p> </p><p>“Heard you guys were having a party… Who invited day shift?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze. Her spine went rigid at the sound of that voice.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t happening. That voice. That person. She wasn’t supposed to be here. She was supposed to be at Westview Regional, the same place that woman worked at nearly ten years ago. Out of sight. Out of reach. Out of Agatha’s goddamn life.</p><p> </p><p>She inhaled slowly, bracing herself to face the woman she had spent the better part of a decade not thinking about. Or pretending not to. Success had never really been the point. Agatha was excellent at rewriting her own narrative when it suited her.</p><p> </p><p>Denial was a river in Egypt, and she'd been floating along it with a drink in hand and no intention of docking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned around with her shoulders tall, head held high, and met the face of the last person she wanted to see.</p><p> </p><p>Rio Vidal stood beside the portable x-ray machine in forest green scrubs, her hair clipped back. Those brown eyes scanned Agatha’s face with a slight arch of her brow and the faint press of her tongue into her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio’s gaze dropped. It traveled down Agatha’s body, obnoxious and obvious, before dragging back up with the same infuriating ease.</p><p> </p><p>“Didn’t think Wanda let you out after dark.” </p><p> </p><p>Rio was fighting a smirk. Agatha could see it, and it made her want to rip a lead apron in half.</p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing here?” Agatha asked, too clipped to pass for casual.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced to the side, then back at her with mock innocence. “My job?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and scoffed just as the respiratory therapist made her way over to the bedspace to help with the x-ray. The baby was intubated, which meant it was a two person job. The RT reached for one of the heavy lead aprons hanging from the front of the portable and slipped it on.</p><p> </p><p>“How long has it been, Agatha?” Rio asked, voice light. “Since you acquired the Darkhold? You hid behind all that dark magic.”</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck are you talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped up to the isolette, flipping open the access ports without waiting for a reply. On the other side, the RT mirrored her movements, her voice bright and oblivious.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t mind Rio,” the RT said, adjusting her grip on the baby’s ET tube. “She’s always been a little odd, but she’s the NICU’s favorite x-ray tech.”</p><p> </p><p>By then, Rio was dragging the x-ray arm into position over the isolette.</p><p> </p><p>It took everything in Agatha not to snap. She could feel her jaw lock tight, every word she wanted to say caught behind clenched teeth. Instead, she forced a smile toward the RT, one that absolutely did not reach her eyes. It felt brittle. It probably looked worse.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed flatly and turned her attention to the baby instead, carefully moving the wires and leads aside so they wouldn’t show up in the image.</p><p> </p><p>“That is so lovely, Sharon,” Rio said from Sheryl's side of the isolette. She leaned in a little and added in a mock whisper, “You’re my favorite RT. Don’t tell the others.”</p><p> </p><p>Sharon laughed, clearly enjoying the attention. “Oh, Rio. Your secret’s safe with me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a disgusted sound in the back of her throat and kept positioning the baby.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved to her side of the isolette, holding the small x-ray detector in both hands. “Ma’lady,” she said with a mock bow.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped back just enough to give her room, but kept her hands inside the isolette. Rio slid out the tray that holds the detector and placed it gently into position. Her hand brushed lightly against Agatha’s stomach in the process.</p><p> </p><p>“Watch it,” Agatha muttered through clenched teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just gave a casual salute and walked back to the portable, grabbing the corded exposure button and stepping a few feet away. “You know, Agatha,” she called over her shoulder, “you really should be wearing lead.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t tell me what to do.”</p><p> </p><p>The machine powered up with a loud hum. A moment later, it beeped loudly, signaling the image had been taken.</p><p> </p><p>“How’s it look, Rio?” Sherry asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Positioning’s perfect. All required anatomy is there,” Rio said. “As for anything else, well… they don’t pay me enough to have opinions.”</p><p> </p><p>Sharon laughed too loud, clearly enjoying herself more than the moment deserved.</p><p> </p><p>Once the exam was finished, Rio walked back over to the isolette, reached for the machine’s arm, and retrieved the detector. Agatha shifted as much as she could without letting go of the baby, her body contorting at an odd angle to keep her arms steady in the isolette while making absolutely certain Rio wouldn’t come close enough to graze her again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and some name starting with an S- worked together to settle the preemie again. Carefully readjusting until the infant stopped protesting with full body fury enough for him to remember how to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Her second patient wasn’t intubated, so the RT didn’t stick around. But not before she tossed a warning over her shoulder, “You really should listen to Rio. That lead’s not just decoration.” Sharla crossed the pod to another bedspace without fanfare, her lead apron still in place, chatting easily with whoever was next in line.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Just rolled her eyes and kept her expression flat.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t that Agatha didn’t know better. The dose was tiny. But for people who stood in it every night, leaned in close, kept their hands inside while the image was taken- it could start to add up. So yeah, lead aprons and distance were habits probably worth keeping, but no one was forcing it. You did what felt right. Some people wore it every time. Some didn’t. Agatha didn’t always bother. It usually depended on the day.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved on to her next patient in the bedspace over. Rio followed, rolling the portable behind her and parking it at the isolette. </p><p> </p><p>When the very annoying RT was out of earshot, Agatha turned back to the machine and ripped the lead apron from its hook. She pulled it on, fastened it tight across her torso, and adjusted the thyroid shield around her neck without looking up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was watching her. The corners of her mouth hinted at a smile she didn’t bother to hide.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t give her the courtesy of eye contact. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha adjusted the micro into position while Rio set up the machine. When Rio came around to her side to place the detector, Agatha didn’t even look up.</p><p> </p><p>“Nope,” Agatha said simply, nodding toward the opposite side of the isolette, where no one was standing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sighed and rolled her eyes but didn’t argue. She circled around the machine and did exactly what she was told.</p><p> </p><p>As she worked, Agatha glanced up. She hadn’t seen Rio in ten years and for a second, she just wanted to look.</p><p> </p><p>But the second her eyes found Rio’s face, Rio looked up too. Their eyes met briefly, and Agatha dropped her gaze just as fast.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t miss it. “So,” she said, drawing it out. “How’s the ol’ ball and chain?”</p><p> </p><p>“Not your damn beeswax,” Agatha snapped. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes went wide with amusement. She said nothing, pressing her tongue into her cheek to keep from laughing as she moved back to the portable.</p><p> </p><p>When it was done, Agatha tore the lead off her body and neck, not bothering with care or quiet, and dropped it back onto the machine.</p><p> </p><p>After her x-rays were done, Agatha dropped into the high rolling chair, the seat bouncing under her with a dull thud. She focused on charting, jaw tight, while Rio made her way around the pod, hitting a few more bedspaces, talking to every nurse or RT she crossed paths with.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t dare turn around. But her ears were absolutely working overtime.</p><p> </p><p>“Those new scrubs? That color looks great on you!”</p><p> </p><p>There was a soft laugh from the nurse.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed under her breath. “Fucking flirt,” she mumbled, clicking a little harder on the mouse than she needed to.</p><p> </p><p>A few minutes passed. She kept her head down when she heard the wheels of the portable rolling toward the door. Agatha wasn’t going to look. That was the plan.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>Her head turned before she could stop it. Instinct. Old, dumb muscle memory.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in the doorway, backing out with the portable in front of her. Her smile was soft. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m glad you’re back.” It wasn’t a performance. There was no dig tucked into it. Only sincerity.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a nod and the flattest version of a smile she could manage. It wasn’t warm, but it wasn’t cruel either.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s smile widened slightly, the gap in her teeth flashing for half a second before she disappeared through the door.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned back to her charting and kept her eyes on the screen, pretending her pulse hadn’t changed at all.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio’s friendship had always defied explanation. It was subterranean. Pressurized. Preserved in a way that made it feel ancient and untouched, even now.</p><p> </p><p>There had never been a confession. Never a moment Agatha could point to and say, ‘There that’s when I knew.’ But it lived in her anyway. In the unspoken rules. In the stillness between jokes. In the way her chest still tightened, all these years later, when something reminded her of Rio and there was no one to say it to.</p><p> </p><p>They weren’t soulmates. They weren’t lovers. They were best friends in a way that ruins a person for anyone else. Best friends in the way that made everything after feel performative.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t lose Rio because of some spectacular fallout. There was no fight, no betrayal, no line crossed. Just the slow accumulation of choices that didn’t include her. The slow realization that if something wasn’t named, it couldn’t be mourned.</p><p> </p><p>Even now, divorced and hollowed out by it, Agatha couldn’t explain the loss without sounding delusional.</p><p> </p><p>They met seventeen years ago. Through other people. It wasn’t fate. It wasn’t even remarkable. But somehow they’d locked into each other instantly, like two objects caught in each other’s orbit.</p><p> </p><p>Alice had introduced her casually- Rio Vidal, Westview Regional. Didn’t say much else. Didn’t need to. Rio was impossible to miss. She had been leaned back in a cheap plastic chair, black hoodie, one converse resting on the table like it lived there. Unlit cigarette hanging from her mouth, shuffling a deck of cards. Rio glanced up only once.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>“Who invited day shift?”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had shown up to game night out of spite, not interest. Jen had invited her- probably as some warped professional courtesy after their first week on nights together. She hadn’t planned to stay long. Definitely hadn’t planned to notice anyone.</p><p> </p><p>But then a woman named Rio Vidal opened her stupid fucking mouth. And Agatha forgot she’d come there to be unimpressed.</p><p> </p><p>Jen tried to smooth it over, but Agatha wasn’t having it. She sat down, yanked the cards from Rio, and made it her personal mission to win everything for the rest of the night out of pure, targeted pettiness.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t speak much that night. Agatha left with a headache and no intention of ever seeing Rio again.</p><p> </p><p>Which, in retrospect, might’ve been when everything started.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t work at the same hospital. Didn’t even live in the same part of town. There was no real reason for them to keep crossing paths after that first game night.</p><p> </p><p>But somehow, they did.</p><p> </p><p>Group things, mostly. Birthdays, breakfasts and nights out organized by mutual friends. They kept ending up in the same places, standing near each other like it was accidental, even when it wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>They barely spoke at first. Just exchanged looks. Sniped a little. But Rio was the kind of person who could piss someone off without even trying, and Agatha had always been easy to provoke. </p><p> </p><p>Barely speaking turned into constant bickering. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha told herself it was the principle of the thing. That Rio was rude and needed to be humbled. That it wasn’t personal…</p><p> </p><p>…Eventually, the texts started. Then the nicknames. Then the habit of showing up for things neither of them actually wanted to attend just because the other one would be there. They weren’t friends. They were foils. That’s what Agatha told herself. Opposites. A bit. A long running joke.</p><p> </p><p>It happened so gradually, Agatha didn’t even realize she’d started checking her phone for Rio’s name without meaning to. Or that Rio had started asking what days she was off like it was logistical, not emotional.</p><p> </p><p>There was no confession. No shift in tone. Nothing overt. But Rio stopped flinching when Agatha sat too close. And Agatha stopped pretending she didn’t feel better in Rio’s presence. They didn’t talk about it. That was the unspoken rule. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped correcting people when they said Rio was her best friend. And Rio -who didn’t let anyone in, who kept people at arm’s length even when hugging them- never once pulled away from Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>They became each other’s default. Quietly. Permanently. Without realizing it had happened.</p><p> </p><p>People made assumptions, of course. About whether they were more than friends, about the way they moved around each other. Agatha always denied it. So did Rio. And neither of them were lying. But Agatha <em>would</em> be lying if she said there weren’t moments.</p><p> </p><p>Long, quiet, difficult to categorize moments. Nights where their laughter went too soft. Where Rio’s eyes stayed on Agatha’s mouth a second too long. Where Agatha didn’t move away when Rio leaned in too close and didn’t make a joke to break the tension.</p><p> </p><p>They never touched though, not in a way that would’ve changed anything.</p><p> </p><p>But it would’ve taken almost nothing.</p><p> </p><p>And suddenly the joke wasn’t funny anymore. Or maybe it was, but neither of them were laughing.</p><p> </p><p>Then came Wanda along.</p><p> </p><p>A bar. A drink Agatha didn’t like and a stranger who smiled at her.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda didn’t flirt. She asked. She invited. She followed up.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, too tired to play along and too curious not to, said yes.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda never liked Rio. Said she was arrogant. That the jokes were cruel, the calm was fake, the detachment exhausting. Said Agatha acted differently around her. Smart mouthed. Less filtered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pretended not to care. She said Wanda didn’t get it. That Rio was all bark, no bite. That their friendship was weird but harmless.</p><p> </p><p>Rio started answering texts later than usual. Started showing up less. She stopped lingering after things. Started bowing out with ‘<em>next time</em>’ instead of excuses.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha thought maybe it was just scheduling. That Rio was busy. That it wasn’t about her.</p><p> </p><p>But when she asked, offhand, if she was coming to a party Wanda was hosting, Rio just said<em>, “No,”</em> and didn’t explain. No sarcasm. No performance. Just… nothing.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when it started: the quiet.</p><p> </p><p>A distance that felt more like mercy than resentment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was giving her space. And Agatha- stupidly, blindly- took it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha told herself it was maturity. Boundaries. A natural shift. People grow up, grow apart. It wasn’t a big deal.</p><p> </p><p>It was a huge deal. She just hadn’t seen it yet.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha told Rio she was moving to Chicago, Rio didn’t argue.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say don’t go. Didn’t ask if it was what Agatha really wanted. She just nodded and said she was happy for Agatha. That was it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha realized she didn’t want support. Not from Rio. Not like that. Not when she was moving across the country with someone Rio couldn’t even pretend to like.</p><p> </p><p>They said goodbye in the kitchen of Agatha’s apartment. Wanda was in the next room, probably pretending not to listen. Rio stood by the sink with her arms crossed.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped forward and hugged Agatha- brief, careful, like she didn’t trust herself with more. Rio smelled like clean laundry. Her arms were solid, but the rest of her felt like scaffolding, like something holding itself up out of sheer will.</p><p> </p><p>When she pulled back, she gave Agatha a smile that didn’t reach her eyes. A small one. The smile people use when they don’t want to be asked how they’re doing. A smile that says, <em>‘I’m happy for you. Please don’t ask me to prove it.’</em></p><p> </p><p>And Agatha didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>She let Rio walk out the door without asking the question they’d both been avoiding for years.</p><p> </p><p>Even though something in her chest pulled so hard it felt like gravity had broken.</p><p> </p><p>It would’ve been easier if they’d fought. If someone had yelled or accused or slammed the door. But instead, they both stood still and let the moment pass.</p><p> </p><p>Let each other pass.</p><p> </p><p>Rio never asked her to stay. And Agatha, god help her, needed Rio to ask.</p><p> </p><p>But she was Agatha Harkness, stubborn and loyal to all the wrong things.</p><p> </p><p>She let Rio go.</p><p> </p><p>Now, years later, Agatha’s back.</p><p> </p><p>Back at St. Rita’s. Back on nights. Back in the NICU where everything still works the same and no one remembers her name.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t come back for closure. She didn’t come back for anyone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha came back because it was hers first.</p><p> </p><p>And now Rio’s here too.</p><p> </p><p>Not at another hospital. Not somewhere safely distant. Here. Wearing scrubs. Working nights. Acting like nothing happened.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t know how long Rio’s been at St. Rita’s, and she’s not about to ask. It doesn’t matter. It’s not like she planned her move back based on who might be on the payroll.</p><p> </p><p>But it’s still jarring.</p><p> </p><p>There’s no rule against running into someone you haven’t spoken to in ten years and realizing nothing about them has changed except their hair and the exact angle of the knife they twist in your gut.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s not mad. </p><p> </p><p>She just wants to know who the fuck decided to keep that particular bit of very fucking important information classified.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The second Agatha stepped off the elevator, she called Jen. She didn’t care if she was asleep or not.</p><p> </p><p>“Hello,” Jen answered, voice thick with sleep.</p><p> </p><p>“What the actual fuck,” Agatha hissed into the speaker, walking fast through the crowd of day shift arrivals.</p><p> </p><p>“You need-”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I need, bitch,” Agatha snapped. “I need a fucking Xanax because you somehow forgot to mention that she fucking works here now.” She was whispering through gritted teeth, eyes darting around the crowd in case someone might overhear. Not that anyone cared. Everyone was too busy on their way to clock in or dragging themselves home.</p><p> </p><p>“I tried to-”</p><p> </p><p>Before Jen could finish, Agatha yelped. Rio had materialized in front of her like she’d been summoned.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit,” Agatha breathed, hand flying to her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood there with her backpack slung over her shoulders, staring at her, teeth pressed into the inside of her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Where the fuck did you come from?” Agatha barked, already hanging up on Jen without letting her finish.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer. She just tilted her head toward the wall Agatha had walked past- apparently where she’d been standing the whole time, probably waiting for Agatha to leave.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped around her, heading for the exit pretending she hadn’t just been jump scared in the middle of the hallway. She could hear Rio’s footsteps falling into place behind her.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you want?” Agatha snapped, not bothering to look over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice was calm, almost bored. “Special breakfast?”</p><p> </p><p>That made Agatha falter.</p><p> </p><p>Special breakfast was their thing- hers, Jen’s, Alice’s, Rio’s. Whoever had worked the same night would meet up afterward, get breakfast and maybe a cocktail, try to rinse off the alarm fatigue before heading home to sleep. It had been routine, once. Safe. Familiar.</p><p> </p><p>Hearing Rio say it now felt like being served a memory with a side of emotional whiplash.</p><p> </p><p>“Nope.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fine. I’ll try again tomorrow,” Rio said, already falling into step beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head to look at her, jaw tight. “What are you trying to do?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. She kept walking, expression unreadable, steps easy. When they reached the double doors, she moved ahead and held one open for Agatha..</p><p> </p><p>“Walking you to your car,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t what Agatha meant.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t need someone to hold a door. She didn’t need politeness, or performative courtesy. She meant, what the hell is this? After ten years. After the most awkward, quiet, gut wrenching goodbye Agatha had ever lived through- and she was a recent divorcee, which really should’ve set the bar.  After ten years of silence so absolute that it was noticeably intentional. And now Rio was holding a door open for her, talking about breakfast, like none of it had ever happened.</p><p> </p><p>It was surreal. It was absolutely fucking insane. It was exactly the kind of thing Rio would do.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. The walk to her car stayed quiet. She wasn’t going to entertain this and honestly, she couldn’t have figured out how even if she tried.</p><p> </p><p>What she did notice was Rio shifting her backpack around to the front of her body, unzipping the same front pocket she’d always used for her keys. That small, familiar habit made Agatha exhale before she even realized she’d been holding her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up, caught her eye for a second, then looked away and swung the backpack back into place. Like she hadn’t meant to be seen. Like she didn’t want Agatha to recognize that she still did things exactly the same.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together and bit the inside of her cheek. Something else to focus on. Something else to hurt.</p><p> </p><p>“See you tonight?” Rio asked, peeling off toward the far end of the lot.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s laugh rang out behind her, loud and smug and completely unnecessary.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha kept walking, pretending it wasn’t the sound of her past catching up to her.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled into her driveway and immediately spotted Jennifer Kale leaning against the hood of her car, arms crossed, clearly waiting. She looked like she’d rolled out of bed minutes ago- sweats, a wrinkled t-shirt.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t acknowledge Jen. She killed the engine, grabbed her shit, and headed straight to her front door. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” Jen called after her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept walking. Jen’s footsteps followed, quickening behind her. “I tried to tell you-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stopped cold. Turned. “When?” She snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Jen raised her brow. “You serious?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. I am.” Agatha stepped closer. “I want to know when. Because I’m pretty sure I’d remember that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I tried at breakfast- more than once. I tried that day during report when I said, ‘Hey, you should probably know who’s working in Imaging now,’ and you literally said, ‘If this is about her, don’t.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned. The words were familiar. She remembered saying them. She just hadn’t let herself actually hear it.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t stop. “I tried when Alice brought her up in front of you and you changed the subject so fast it gave me whiplash. I tried when you said, ‘I don’t care what she’s doing, I don’t want to know.’</p><p> </p><p>Agatha perused her lips and said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“So no,” Jen said. “I didn’t spell it out for you because you made it very clear you didn’t want to know.” </p><p> </p><p>That was the fucked up part. Agatha hadn’t been lying when she said it. She hadn’t wanted to know. Not if it meant remembering what she left. What she didn’t ask for because Rio hadn’t offered. Because Rio hadn’t said anything. Not when it mattered. Not when Agatha was practically begging for it, in all the quiet ways she thought would be understood.</p><p> </p><p>She would’ve stayed. She knows that now. She absolutely would’ve stayed.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio had asked.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha left. Because someone had to make a decision, and it sure as hell wasn’t going to be her best friend, the one who always knew what to say until the one time Agatha needed her to actually say it.</p><p> </p><p>So no, Agatha didn’t want to know. Not after all that silence. Not after being made to feel like wanting more had been the mistake.</p><p> </p><p>And now? Now she was the one who looked like a fucking fool for not listening. Furious at Jen for doing exactly what Agatha asked. Furious at herself for meaning it.</p><p> </p><p>She exhaled slowly, like the air itself might burn on the way out. Her voice was softer when she spoke. “You should’ve told me anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>“You mean after you told me not to? Multiple times.”</p><p> </p><p>“Correct.”</p><p> </p><p>Because someone should’ve called Agatha’s bluff. Someone should’ve risked it. Because Agatha hadn’t meant it. She never fucking meant it.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Jen said quietly. “I should’ve.”</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t make Agatha feel better.</p><p> </p><p>“Does she know?” Agatha asked, keeping her eyes on the sidewalk.</p><p> </p><p>“Know about what?”</p><p> </p><p>“The divorce.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t answer right away.</p><p> </p><p>That was enough of an answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “So she does.”</p><p> </p><p>“Alice tried not to bring it up, but you know her and Rio are close.” Jen said with a shrug.</p><p> </p><p>Of course. Alice.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s best friend. Jen’s wife. The unfortunate bridge between all of them.</p><p> </p><p>“Unfortunately,” Jen said, and her voice was wry, a little sad. “I got you in the divorce. Alice got Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her. Jen didn’t flinch.</p><p> </p><p>It hurt more than it should’ve. Because it meant everyone else had seen it for what it was when even to do this day they would both rather deny it than admit what they never had the courage to hold.</p><p> </p><p>The irony was humiliating. Everything about it was fucking humiliating.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had walked away from a real marriage, signed the papers, changed her name back, packed up the pieces of a life that never fit right and none of it compared to that split.</p><p> </p><p>Isn’t that fucking insane?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ended an actual marriage and it wasn’t even <em>that</em> marriage that made her feel like a wife walking out on the wrong person.</p><p> </p><p>She’d never even kissed Rio. Not once. You’d think Agatha would’ve gotten that much. Some small consolation for all the circling, all the silence, all the things she never let herself say out loud.</p><p> </p><p>But no. Not even that.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down at her shoes. “Funny, isn’t it?” she said, voice quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t answer. And thank fuck for that mercy. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The next night, at exactly 2:30 a.m., Rio showed up for morning x-rays.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t start with Agatha’s patients.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, when Rio walked in, she didn’t even glance her way. Not once. And Agatha- well, she definitely didn’t notice. She hadn’t spent the entire shift anticipating this moment like a goddamn countdown clock was ticking in her ear. She hadn’t gone back and forth between hoping Rio would show up and praying she wouldn’t. Hadn’t imagined every possible version of this interaction until all that was left was dread.</p><p> </p><p>No, definitely not.</p><p> </p><p>And so what if Rio hadn’t come to her first in a room full of people? It didn’t mean anything. Of course it didn’t. But still- somewhere under her ribs, it landed. Subtle, precise, like a nail set in place by the smallest hand. Like some invisible elf  had found the softest part of her and whispered, <em>‘you still feel this right?’</em> - before the first tap.</p><p> </p><p>Rio got to her last.</p><p> </p><p>She moved through the pod like it was routine like nothing about this night was different from the hundreds that came before.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio did approach, she pulled the portable beside the isolette with the same smooth, methodical rhythm she used for everyone else. Then her eyes found Agatha. They purposely dragged over her, once, twice, slowly enough to register but not long enough to be called anything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She held her ground and pretended she didn’t feel the way that look settled on her skin like it had been waiting all night for permission to look.</p><p> </p><p>“Saved the best for last,” Rio muttered, detector in hand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her. She didn’t speak. Just stared, jaw clenched, expression empty if you didn’t know how to look. Rio always had. That was the problem.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the words that got her. It was the softness in them. The carelessness that wasn’t careless at all. Like something inside Rio hadn’t gotten the memo that they weren’t allowed to talk like that anymore. And Agatha’s heart, small and treacherous, softened.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the exam passed in silence. So did the next.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Thank fuck.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>One of her babies was having a meltdown, pissed off in that uniquely preemie way that didn’t understand logic. He was flailing like he had a personal vendetta against respiratory support, glaring at Agatha through the isolette wall with all the fury his tiny face could muster. At one point, he threw a hand toward the ET tube threatening his own life in protest. ‘Do it again and I will die on purpose.’ The message was clear. The drama was exhausting.</p><p> </p><p>And still, she would’ve taken a dozen more like him if it meant not thinking about the way Rio had looked at her. Not feeling it still.</p><p> </p><p>By the time four a.m. rolled around, Agatha called out to the other nurses in her pod that she was taking her lunch and told them to keep an eye on her kiddos. They all responded without missing a beat. She got a chorus of murmured “got it”s and “you’re good,” and that was enough.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lunch was going to be a cigarette.</p><p> </p><p>That was it. That’s all she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had made her quit two years into their relationship, and she had. Cold turkey. Swore up and down, even pinky promised like a moron. But she never really stopped. Every couple of weeks, maybe longer if things were good, she’d sneak one. A little rebellion she kept to herself. Wanda never noticed. Sue her. </p><p> </p><p>She left the unit, took the elevator down, cut through a couple of empty hallways, pushed through the double door employee exit, and headed toward her car. The air outside was brisk and damp, smelling of pavement, dew, and whatever fresh mulch they’d dumped in the flowerbeds a few days ago.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rifled through the middle console until her fingers closed around a half squished carton of Virginia Slims 120s and a scratched up purple Bic lighter. Then she made the walk, past the rows of sleeping cars and motion activated floodlights, to the far end of the lot where an old administration building sat abandoned. She ducked around the side, where the cameras didn’t reach and no one ever bothered to patrol.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled a cigarette from the carton, slipped it between her lips. The lighter took a few flicks before the flame held. She brought it up, cupping her hand around it to block the wind, then lit it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fell shut as she breathed it in. One arm crossed over her stomach, the other held the cigarette steady between her fingers- pointer and middle. </p><p> </p><p>It burned beautifully. Coated her lungs in tar and defiance.</p><p> </p><p>Smoking was the only thing Agatha never gave up completely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had given up a lot, actually. More than she ever said out loud. Night shift. Her best friend. Westview. The only life that felt like her own. Gave up so much she barely recognized what was left. </p><p> </p><p>All for a woman who mistook devotion for obedience. Who kept asking, kept taking, until there was nothing left to offer. And still, she’d asked for more. She would always ask for more.</p><p> </p><p>But this? This breath, this sting in her chest, this small, selfish mercy- was the one thing she never let Wanda actually touch. Never asked permission for. Never pretended she could live without.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda never noticed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept it hidden. Kept it as proof she still belonged to herself and still, it went unnoticed. Somehow, that made it worse. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha held it in for a beat longer then let the smoke spill from her mouth in a slow stream and let her head back against the brick wall behind her. </p><p> </p><p> No rush. No guilt. Just hers.</p><p> </p><p>“Anyone ever tell you smoking kills? You’re a nurse. You should probably know that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly launched herself into the next plane of existence. She jolted so hard her cigarette almost flew out of her hand, and for a split second, she genuinely wondered if her soul had evacuated her body.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha hissed, whipping around. “What the fuck is wrong with you?”</p><p> </p><p>And of course, it was her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio fucking Vidal, strolling out of the shadows, summoned by nicotine and bad decisions. Unlit cigarette hanging from her mouth. Hands shoved in the pockets of her scrub pants. </p><p> </p><p>“Would you stop doing that?” Agatha barked, hand still pressed to her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned her shoulder against the wall, casually plucked the cigarette from her mouth with two fingers, and looked at Agatha with mock innocence. “Doing what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Stalking me, freak.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not stalking you,” Rio said, deadpan. “This is where I smoke.”</p><p> </p><p>“How do you even kno-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t finish.</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the sentence stuck somewhere behind her teeth, caught on a memory she hadn’t meant to touch.</p><p> </p><p>Because she did know.</p><p> </p><p>It started with one night. One truly god awful shift. The kind of night that left her buzzing under her skin, chest tight, hands shaking even after washing them three times. She’d texted Rio without thinking. Just said she needed a cigarette or she was going to lose it. </p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t expected a response. Rio didn’t work at her hospital then. It was just a throwaway text. </p><p> </p><p>But by the time Agatha made it outside her own pack of cigarettes gripped tightly in her hand, Rio was already sitting on the curb. Unlit cigarette hanging from her lips, legs stretched out, hood up like she’d been born for the graveyard shift. She didn’t say hello. Just offered the lighter.</p><p> </p><p>After that, it just kept happening.</p><p> </p><p>Not often. Not on any schedule. But every once in a while, when Rio had the night off, Agatha would get a text. Just four words: <em>outside when you can</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio would show up- parked in the same spot, waiting in the dark, leaning against the building or sitting on the pavement. </p><p> </p><p>They didn’t speak unless they wanted to. Sometimes Agatha would vent. Sometimes she’d sit there in silence, staring at the sky. Sometimes she cried and said it was allergies. Rio never called her on it.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t some grand gesture. It wasn’t romance or rescue.</p><p> </p><p>It was just Rio. Solid. Still. Showing up even when everything else was falling apart.</p><p> </p><p>And now here Rio was again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, eyes narrowing with a small, knowing smile- confirming the moments Agatha had remembered. </p><p> </p><p>“Got a light?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head away from her. She took another drag and exhaled. “You have one.”</p><p> </p><p>“I want yours.” </p><p> </p><p>There was no tease in Rio’s voice. It was quiet. Intentional. </p><p> </p><p>And because Agatha was a little bitch in the presence of beautiful women specifically named Rio Vidal, she handed it over without protest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t take it. She just stared at the lighter in Agatha’s palm. Her eyes dragged from the lighter back up to Agatha’s face with unhurried precision, like she was deciding whether to ruin Agatha or leave it for later.</p><p> </p><p>“What? You forget how to take it all of a sudden?” Agatha snapped. She wasn’t annoyed that Rio kept looking at her like that. It was that Agatha didn’t think she ever wanted it to stop. And that unsettled her. Because she knew the flirting wasn’t real. It was a shield, something Rio hid behind. A performance with no promise behind it. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I can show you exactly how well I can take it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even bother pretending. She let herself feel it-  that pull low in her stomach, hot and immediate, striking like a match in the dark. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s flirting was worse than she remembered. She used to be subtle about it. Sly comments, discreet looks, lines that could pass as jokes if you needed them to. But this? This was different. Blunt. Direct. Like Rio wasn’t interested in pretending anymore. And Agatha hated how much it worked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed and took another drag, cigarette back between her lips, and she let her head fall against the brick. The surface was cool through her hair, solid in a way she needed. Agatha rolled her head to the side, so she could look at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Under the dim cast of a single building light bolted to the wall above them, humming and flickering faintly, Agatha let her gaze drag.</p><p> </p><p>She took in the line of Rio’s shoulders, the angle of her jaw, the way the light touched her face like it remembered them too. And her hair wasn’t dyed black anymore. It was brown now, her natural color, pulled half up into a small little bun at the back of her head. The rest brushed her shoulders, shorter than it used to be. And still, somehow, exactly her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked older now. Not startling, just the subtle changes time leaves behind when it thinks no one’s watching. Agatha wanted to memorize all of it. She let her eyes drag, cataloguing every difference, every new detail etched into the face she used to know like her own. Then, just to make Rio squirm, Agatha let her eyes settle on Rio’s mouth. Lingering. Controlled. She watched as Rio’s lips parted, watched the way her tongue swept across them.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when she noticed Rio’s hand slipping from her scrub pocket, fingers inching toward Agatha’s waist. It paused and hovered. But Rio didn’t touch her. Her hand faltered, then fell away, retreating into the safety of her scrub pocket to tuck the impulse out of sight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dragged her gaze back to Rio’s eyes and smirked, letting the falter crown her the victor.</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised the hand still holding her unlit cigarette, tapping the filter against her lips before glancing at Agatha. “You know this isn’t the only fag I’ve been dying to wrap my mouth around.” The line was filth, but it came out like she’d been waiting to use it for years.</p><p> </p><p>Rio placed the cigarette between her lips, chin tilted in silent demand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but turned to face her fully, stuck the end of her own nearly spent cigarette between her teeth, and flicked the lighter to life. She lifted it with one hand, shielding the flame with the other. Rio met her halfway, palm against Agatha’s, thumb brushing the side of her hand.</p><p> </p><p>The cigarette caught. Agatha ripped away feeling like she’d been burned.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back against the wall and tore the crumpled pack from her pocket, fingers trembling just enough to give herself away.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled the dying cigarette from her mouth, dropped it to the pavement, and crushed it beneath her heel. Then she lit the fresh one and drew in fast, clipped puffs. Her jaw stayed tight.</p><p> </p><p>The only thing worse than listening to Rio talk was letting Rio see what it did to her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t stop watching her. She never had. Cigarette perched between her fingers, she squinted slightly, lips parted. She took a long drag, exhaled away from Agatha, then turned her head back with a smirk curling at the end. Head tilted, tongue pushing into her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>She mirrored Agatha, back to the wall now, eyes bright with amusement.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s the matter baby?” she murmured, pitch sugary sweet and just a touch cruel. “You forget how to play?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh and shook her head. “No,” she said, breath catching a little. “You’re just no fun anymore.” She flicked the ash and sparks scattered against the pavement.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch, which annoyed Agatha more than it should have. She just rolled her eyes and smirked.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” Rio said. “You love it. You prefer-</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t even know each other.”</p><p> </p><p>And that was true. Sudden and overwhelming. They’d been out of each other’s lives longer than they’d ever been in them. Strangers, technically.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took another drag and said, quieter this time, “Sure we do. You’re my ex…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused.</p><p> </p><p>“…Best friend.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so much more annoying than I remember,” Agatha muttered, not meaning for it to sound soft, but failing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded toward the cigarette between Agatha’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>“Too good for American Spirits now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha side eyed her. “I prefer my cancer have a little class. Take notes.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t say the rest. That she couldn’t smoke American Spirits anymore without tasting regret. That they reminded her of cheap bars, cold parking lots, and a person she had spent ten years trying not to miss.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio’s face twisted, “Where’s your wife?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head whipped toward her. “Cut the shit. You know we’re divorced.”</p><p> </p><p>“Do I?” Rio snapped. “Because apparently we don’t know each other.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulders stiffened. “Why are you even here?” she snapped back.</p><p> </p><p>“I work here.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not what I meant.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, “Then ask a better question.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t. She couldn’t without giving something away. Without admitting she’d already started playing a game she told herself she was done with.</p><p> </p><p>Rio just stood there, like she was still waiting for Agatha to make the next move. Like she hadn’t already made hers the second she showed back up.</p><p> </p><p>It was a pattern. A dance. A loop they’d fallen into a thousand times before.</p><p> </p><p>Old habits die hard. And apparently, neither of them had changed enough to kill this one.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the cigarette fall from her fingers and crushed it under her shoe. “Break is over,” she mumbled, already walking away.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze. Eyes shut. A sigh caught in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>She told herself it was exhaustion. That’s why something in her spine flinched toward that stupid, fucking nickname like it still belonged to her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was off the wall now, standing like she might finally say something. Something important. Her eyes wide, her mouth half open like the sentence got caught in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha braced herself. “Yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>“I- “ Rio’s voice cracked. She cleared her throat, looked down, then back up again. “Special breakfast?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a noise that wasn’t a laugh. More a breath shoved through her teeth, bitter and stunned. She brought her hand up over her mouth and waved it. “You’ve got to be kidding me,” Agatha said, not even looking at Rio now. “No.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched her carefully. She took drag from her cigarette, her eyes flicking down Agatha’s body. She nodded, smoke still held in her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, exhaling. “I’ll try again tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes so hard it hurt and turned back toward the hospital. She didn’t look back.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t keep letting this happen.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had come to terms with a thousand versions of herself. But this burn under her skin, this pulse in her throat, this unbearable awareness of Rio Vidal standing only feet away- this was not one of them.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t a version of herself she’d outgrown. It was one she’d locked up and buried with her own hands, swearing she’d never let it speak again.</p><p> </p><p>And now it was breathing. Loud. Alive. And entirely too fucking close for comfort.</p>

  <p>When Agatha finishes report, she grabs her shit and heads out of the unit. She hits the exit button on the double doors, turns right and stops dead in her tracks.</p><p> </p><p>The squeak of her shoes gives her away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio is sitting on a bench halfway down the hallway, backpack still on, smushed awkwardly between her and the wall. Legs kicked out, ankles crossed, scrolling through her phone.</p><p> </p><p>She looks up at the sound, sees Agatha, and immediately straightens. Her phone disappears into her pocket. Rio stands and then Agatha sees what she’s holding.</p><p> </p><p>An unopened bottle of Diet Coke.</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything. Just jerks her head toward the elevators.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t have the energy to argue.</p><p> </p><p>They walk in silence, side by side, down the long stretch of hallway toward the far end elevators.</p><p> </p><p>At the elevator bank, Rio hits the down button, then holds out the soda.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha takes it automatically and looks at the bottle. </p><p> </p><p>She had told Rio they didn’t know each other anymore.</p><p> </p><p>This was a reminder. A correction.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha always drank Diet Coke. Always had, before Rio even knew her. She used to say it kept her from committing crimes.</p><p> </p><p>When she looked up again, Rio was watching Agatha like she knew exactly who she was.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say thank you.</p><p> </p><p>They rode the elevator down in silence.</p><p> </p><p>It was that stupid silence that made Agatha want to punch a wall or kiss someone she shouldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>When the doors opened, Rio stepped out first. She didn’t look at Agatha, still didn’t speak. Only walked ahead like she knew Agatha would follow. And she did.</p><p> </p><p>They moved through the hallway side by side, neither reaching for conversation. At the exit, Rio stepped forward, pushed the door open, and waited.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha walked through it without saying anything. </p><p> </p><p>“Special breakfast?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. “Answer’s still no,” she mumbled.</p><p> </p><p>It was supposed to be firm. A shut door. It fell flat.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll try again tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She kept walking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made it to her car, slid into the driver’s seat, threw her bag into the passenger seat, and slammed the car door shut. She sat there, hands on the steering wheel, keys in her lap, and jaw locked.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t shaken. Just tired. Long shift. Alarm fatigue.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had a talent for showing up uninvited and making it look casual. Holding doors. Hanging around. Tossing out the same recycled material like they were still playing the same stupid game.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed the heels of her hands into her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio thought she could pick up where she left off and Agatha would just roll with it.  It wasn’t cute. It wasn’t clever. It was fucking lazy.</p><p> </p><p>“Special breakfast,” Agatha hissed. “I will throw a brick at your car!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slumped back in the seat, dragging both hands down her face.</p><p> </p><p>She let out a breathless, furious laugh. Then slammed her hands against the steering wheel and shouted, “FUCK.”</p><p> </p><p>Of course Rio was still showing up. Acting like they’d never stopped talking. Like ten years of silence could be fixed with stupid flirting and a fucking bottle of soda.</p><p> </p><p>“You think you can just show up with your smug little smirk and your perfectly fucking timed Diet Coke and your… your… lips and everything’s just back to normal?!”</p><p> </p><p>Another smack to the wheel.</p><p> </p><p>“‘I’ll show you exactly how well I can take it,’” she mocked, high pitched and venomous. “You’re not even that hot!” She shouted at the windshield.</p><p> </p><p>A pause.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, you are. You’re so hot, and that’s the problem, and I fucking hate you!” Agatha slammed the horn and held down out of pure spite.</p><p> </p><p>She whipped the car out of the parking space,  fleeing the scene of a crime.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was fine.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t spiraling-</p><p> </p><p>BUMP.</p><p> </p><p>She hit the curb. Hard.</p><p> </p><p>“FUCK,” Agatha shouted, already driving away and ignoring it ever happened.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped her car into the parking lot. She parked crooked, didn’t fix it. Killed the engine, and took a deep breath that did absolutely nothing.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t sleep well. But she slept, which she figured counted for something. It was her third shift in a row. The final stretch. Twelve more hours and then she was free.</p><p> </p><p>Four days off. Four nights of sleep. Four whole rotations of the earth without Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed her bag from the passenger seat. Picked up her coffee. Pushed the door open.</p><p> </p><p>And immediately wished the ground would open up and swallow her whole.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in the parking lot. Leaning against someone’s bumper in black scrubs, arms crossed, laughing at something said by a woman Agatha didn’t recognize. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looks-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Fuck, she looks so good.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked radiant in that effortless, infuriating way that had always ruined Agatha- head thrown back, that familiar gap in her teeth on full display, smiling like nothing in the world had ever gone wrong. It wasn’t just the timing or the angle or the way the sun seemed to bend around her. It was Rio Vidal. And Rio had always been too much to witness without consequence.</p><p> </p><p>It was so cinematic, so obscenely perfect, that the soundtrack queued itself without permission.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Baby (I will be your father figure)…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, whispering aloud. “No, no, no. No.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Oh, baby (put your tiny hand in mine)</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze flicked to the woman standing beside Rio, the one who’d earned that laugh. Agatha’s eyes narrowed.  She felt her jaw shift- jutting forward, teeth clenching tight. The feeling hit low in her stomach. </p><p> </p><p>Envy wasn’t the right word. It was meaner than that. Uglier. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wrenched her gaze back to Rio. And her eyes, untrustworthy at best, moved of their own accord, dragging down Rio’s body. Her posture, her mouth, her fucking hands.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>I’d love to (I will be your preacher, teacher)-</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up.</p><p> </p><p>A needle dragged straight across Agatha’s skull and caused the record to scratch. Immediately, she dropped behind her car door, heart pounding, breath caught in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>She fucking prayed.</p><p> </p><p>Not out of belief. That was gone. But desperation doesn’t need a god. It just needs a witness. Trouble never found Agatha when she was whole. It waited until she was already bleeding and then made itself comfortable.</p><p> </p><p>Footsteps.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shot up. Slammed the car door shut. Kept her eyes on anything that wasn’t Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She had made peace with a lot of things in her life… This would not be one.</p><p> </p><p>“Clip any curbs on the way in?” Rio smugly called after her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze, her entire body seizing beneath the sudden rush of anger that surged through her. Her shoulders locked into place and for a moment, all she could do was stand there- heart pounding, jaw clenched, every breath lodged between her ribs and her throat.</p><p> </p><p>The sound alone reached in and pulled her spine taut, every nerve stung in its wake.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned around with the seething exactness of a woman who understood exactly what she could do, and had no intention of wasting it on someone who wanted a show.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t moved. She stayed still by the car, arms crossed in a loose, calculated way that made it impossible to tell whether she was entertained or just waiting. Her mouth curved, tongue pressing into her cheek, that familiar glint in her eye sharpening with the kind of satisfaction Agatha had seen at least twenty times in the past two days.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Fucking entertained.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Three strides had closed the space between them, and now they stood face to face, breath to breath, the scent of Rio’s laundry detergent was irritatingly clean and familiar in a way that made Agatha want to scrub it off her own skin.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m only going to say this once,” Agatha said, her voice clipped, every syllable carrying more control than she felt, “so you don’t get any more ideas. I’m here to do my job. That’s it. Whatever you think this is, it isn’t. And it won’t be.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head slightly, gaze dropping to Agatha’s mouth before rising again, wearing the same smirk that had long since outstayed its welcome.</p><p> </p><p>“What exactly won’t be happening?” Rio asked, voice light.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever this is- ” she gestured, coffee sloshing dangerously in her hand, “the flirting, the jokes, the Diet Coke, the standing around watching me drive like a lunatic- whatever it is, it ends here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio opened her mouth, clearly ready to say something monumentally stupid, but Agatha cut her off. She raised one finger and held it there.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha started to turn away, finished with the conversation, but stopped and faced Rio again. She lifted her brows just enough to make it clear she meant every word. “I’m not doing this with you. I want you to stop perusing me. I want you to stop making my life here hell. I mean it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move, but her shoulders straightened, her smirk faltered just enough.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for a response. She turned and walked toward the building, coffee still in hand, fingers clenched a little tighter around the cup than before. </p><p> </p><p>She kept walking and swallowed the lump rising in her throat when she didn’t hear footsteps following behind her.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>By the time 2:30am rolled around, Agatha had already angled her chair to face away from the door. She didn’t need to see Rio to know she’d arrived. The screech of that ancient portable x-ray machine was always enough to announce her like some petty parade float, and Agatha had no interest in giving her the satisfaction of a reaction.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her eyes glued to the computer screen and pretended not to notice that 2:40 had come and gone. No sound. No wheels. No obnoxious entrance. Her teeth sank into the inside of her cheek as she stared at the monitor hoping it might start charting out of sympathy.</p><p> </p><p>At 2:45, Agatha heard it.</p><p> </p><p>The machine’s familiar sound entered the pod, stopped at her patient’s bedspace, and it took everything in Agatha not to react. She breathed in slowly, gave it a full second, then turned her chair.</p><p> </p><p>The air left Agatha’s lungs all at once.</p><p> </p><p>The woman standing there wasn’t Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She was younger, paler, maybe two or three inches shorter, with green eyes that caught the light entirely different- nothing like the nauseating brown Agatha had spent the last two days trying not to look at.</p><p> </p><p>“Who are you?” Agatha asked, harsher than intended, the words escaping before she could rein them in.</p><p> </p><p>The woman blinked, visibly startled. “Sage?” she offered, her name rising like a question, clearly thrown off by the intensity of Agatha’s reaction.</p><p> </p><p>“Wher-” Agatha stopped. She had been about to ask where Rio was, but caught herself. </p><p> </p><p>This was what she’d wanted, right? Rio stepping back. Giving Agatha space. No more games, no more baiting, no more making her life hell.</p><p> </p><p>But the silence didn’t feel like relief. It felt like a setup. Like Rio had disappeared just long enough to plan something bigger, louder, harder to ignore, tailored perfectly to get under Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Because that’s what Rio did. She walked away when it mattered. And Agatha had no one to blame but herself for still expecting anything else.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re late,” is all Agatha says to the girl- Sage, apparently.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry. ED’s a mess right now,” the girl replies, eyeing her like Agatha’s grown a second head for giving a shit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond. She gets through the exams, finishes the x-rays, and throws the whole thing out of her mind.</p><p> </p><p>Or she tries to.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio doesn’t show up when Agatha steps out for her cigarette. The silence feels earned. She sits on the curb, stares at the wall across from her, and tries not to think.</p><p> </p><p>She tells herself the silence is a blessing. That distance is what she asked for. But beneath the calm, something tight coils in her chest- nothing dramatic, nothing new. </p><p> </p><p>Just the usual reminder that relief and regret speak in the same voice when no one’s around to argue it.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaves the hospital at 7:34am, alone. She tells herself the tightness in her chest is the air coming easier, lungs no longer straining after two days spent suffocating.</p><p> </p><p>Then, as she pulls out of the lot, Agatha sees her.</p><p> </p><p>Walking along the sidewalk beside the girl who took her patients x-rays, all smiles and half laughs, black scrubs loose around her, arms folded like nothing mattered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught the curb on her way out. </p><p> </p><p>If the car wanted to make a scene, it could take it up with the god who kept writing Agatha into the same one.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Over the next four months, Agatha only saw Rio in passing and rarely at that. Rio never came up to the NICU for x-rays. Instead, it had been Sage or the boy Agatha stubbornly referred to as Teen, no matter how many times he corrected her with Billy.</p><p> </p><p>And over the course of those four months, Agatha figured out which of the two talked more when they thought they weren’t being asked anything.</p><p> </p><p>It was very obviously Teen.</p><p> </p><p>All it took was a few strategically placed  questions.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha found out how the overnight schedule worked for the x-ray department. At midnight, a list of patients populated automatically, and everything had to be done before 7am.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was the one who made the lists, assigning who went where, managing coverage across every floor. Stat orders and add-ons came in constantly from every floor, and traumas ran nonstop through the ED. Only three techs worked overnight on weekends, which was both absurd and, in hindsight, completely expected. No one in management was losing sleep over the graveyard shift.</p><p> </p><p>What caught Agatha off guard was how consistent it had been- Sage, Billy, and Rio, every weekend, every time. And how, without exception, it was never Rio assigned to the NICU. Not once.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t take much effort to connect the dots. Rio was the one assigning the floors. Which meant the distance hadn’t been circumstantial. It was intentional. Rio hadn’t just stayed out of the way. She’d made sure of it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha started picking up every weekend shift without fail. She told herself that it was habit, nothing more than timing and routine, something that didn’t need an explanation. Which was a stretch, considering she made her own schedule. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha still went outside for her lunch break every night. Sometimes she smoked. Sometimes she didn’t. It didn’t matter. The spot was quiet, and it was the only place where no one needed her to do anything or be anywhere. No alarms, no crying babies, no charting. Just enough space to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t waiting for anyone.</p><p> </p><p>No one ever came looking for her.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Wanda called every so often to check in, which Agatha found deeply fucking irritating. They hadn’t ended badly. Which, in retrospect, made it harder. There was no reason not to talk. But that also didn’t mean Agatha had any interest in polite postmortem phone calls with her ex-wife. Said calls felt off half of the time. A little too performed. A little too warm. Like Wanda was reaching for something without saying it aloud.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let it happen. Maybe because she didn’t want to give Wanda the satisfaction of being ignored, or maybe because there was something easier about talking to someone who already knew the worst parts of Agatha and still kept calling.</p><p> </p><p>One night, half distracted and too tired to play along, Agatha made a mistake. She joked, “I could always fly back for that missed opportunity of break up sex. Make it a delayed full circle moment.”</p><p> </p><p>"You could," Wanda said, without missing a beat. "I wouldn’t say no."</p><p> </p><p>Then, before Agatha could respond, she added, "She back in your life, by the way? The one with the brooding and the botanical fixation. I forget her name. Always reminded me of a stray you kept feeding out of guilt."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing. Her stomach turned. She didn’t fuck with any of it- the smugness in Wanda’s voice, the calculated forgetfulness, the way she said it like she hadn’t been waiting to bring her up the second Agatha picked up the phone. Wanda hadn’t forgotten her name. She just refused to say it.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha hated that she’d ever let Wanda speak it like that at all.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was doing well. Not just functional- but like, genuinely well. She’d started going to the gym regularly, and for the first time in years, it wasn’t something she had to drag herself through or accommodate anyone else’s routine for. Wanda had always insisted on tagging along, turning it into a joint activity. This was different. It was hers. It made her feel strong in a way that had nothing to do with anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>Work felt right, too. The rhythm of night shifts in the NICU came back naturally. Jen was there most nights, and their friendship had always been unfiltered in a way only certain kinds of trust allowed. They could bicker across the unit one minute and share a coffee in the hallway the next without missing a beat. It was just them- years deep and well worn.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha made time for people, not out of obligation, but because she wanted to. She’d go over to Jen and Alice’s for drinks some nights, or have them at her house when she had the mental bandwidth to host. They still did the occasional special breakfast after a stretch of night shifts. It was never a set thing. Sometimes it was three people, sometimes seven, sometimes whoever happened to be left standing by the end of the morning.</p><p> </p><p>Every now and then, something about it tugged at Agatha. The awareness of a choice she had made and hadn’t taken back. Agatha had said no. The breakfasts still happened. Rio wasn’t part of them. Agatha didn’t know if she knew that they still happened.</p><p> </p><p>Alice had been to a few. She and Rio were still close, working in the same department now at St. Rita’s instead of Westview Regional. CT and x-ray shared a hallway down in the ED. Different control booths, different machines, but the same shared space. Agatha figured the conversation would’ve been hard to avoid. And Alice wouldn’t lie. Not to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t asked.</p><p> </p><p>But sometimes, when they ended up at the same old diner they used to go to before Agatha had moved, she’d glance toward the door without thinking. Just for a second. Just long enough to remember what it felt like before everything changed.</p><p> </p><p>And even if it felt completely wrong some mornings, Agatha didn’t take her decision back.</p><p> </p><p>Alice and Jen had been hounding her for months to make an appearance at game night. They never pressed but they asked often enough that Agatha knew the invitation hadn’t gone stale. Every time, she declined because she had no interest in risking the very specific balance she’d finally built. She knew who’d be there. And she’d worked too hard to keep that particular variable out of her life.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t running. She was protecting what she’d finally started to rebuild.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>About a month later, Jen and Agatha were in the break room, leaning against the counter with a few other nurses, trading complaints about the new resident while working through a tray of slightly crushed birthday cupcakes. The conversation had started loud, then drifted. In the lull, Jen said it casually, like she was mentioning the weather.</p><p> </p><p>“Game night’s Wednesday this week, if you can make it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth was full when she answered. “Sure. Just text me the time.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t look up from the cupcake she was still picking apart. Didn’t catch the flash of surprise that passed over Jen’s face before she nodded and said, “Will do. My lunch is over… I’ll see you back in the pod.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yup,” Agatha replied, already brushing crumbs off her scrubs.</p><p> </p><p>That was it. No build up. No second guessing. No one said <em>her</em> name.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that was the point. Maybe the room didn’t have to belong to anyone anymore.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Four days later, she stood in front of the full length mirror propped against the corner of her guest bedroom. Her outfit looked casual- relaxed jeans held up by a brown leather belt, a brownish tank top tucked in, and a tan blazer worn slightly oversized, collarless, sleeves rolled once at her wrists. Her white tennis shoes were scuffed but clean, the kind of detail that made the whole thing feel thrown on without being sloppy. Casual enough. Put together without trying too hard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabbed her purse and headed down the stairs. At the front door, she reached for the handle- then stopped, her hand resting against the metal.</p><p> </p><p>She stood there longer than she’d care to admit.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t nerves. Agatha wasn’t afraid to see Rio. But the idea of walking into a space where the silence between them was still the loudest thing in the room… that was harder to swallow.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t said a word to her in five months. No stupid comments. No smug half glances in the hallway. Just space. And maybe that was what Agatha had asked for. Maybe it was even the right thing.</p><p> </p><p>That didn’t mean Agatha liked it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent months building something that finally felt like her own. And now, she didn’t feel the need to guard it so closely.</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed the handle and pulled it open before she could talk herself out of it.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The drive took ten minutes. Agatha had moved closer to Jen and Alice than she liked to admit. At the time, she told everyone it was for the shorter commute, the neighborhood, the price. But really, it was because she liked them. A lot. Which was gross. She didn’t say that part out loud.</p><p> </p><p>It made her feel weirdly soft, like she’d accidentally built her entire adult life around the people who used to feed her boxed wine and let her drag them out to karaoke without a fuss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled up to the curb and killed the engine.</p><p> </p><p>There were a few cars in the driveway. Some she recognized. Some she didn’t. But Rio’s black 4Runner stood out instantly. It wasn’t the same beat up car from years ago but Agatha recognized it because it was parked in the exact spot Agatha expected. Tucked against the far side near the fence, tires aligned like Rio was aiming for gridlines only she could see.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had always been weirdly consistent about things like that. At the hospital, she parked in the same space every shift. Walked the same route through the lot. Never took the closer spots, even when it was pouring rain. It wasn’t convenience, it was principle.</p><p> </p><p>It was stupid. It was the kind of thing you shouldn’t still remember. Where someone preferred to park. The little compulsions no one else noticed. But Agatha noticed. Agatha always fucking noticed. </p><p> </p><p>She looked at the car and felt her chest go tight in a weird, nostalgic way she hated. It made it too easy to pretend none of the in between ever happened. That ten years wasn’t ten years. That Rio was still her Rio, in all the unspoken ways that used to matter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away and told herself it was just a parking spot.</p><p> </p><p>From where she sat, she could see the soft halo of backyard lights glowing through the slats of the fence. Laughter floated under the hum of music. Jen had gone all out again like she always did. String lights, planters, a patio with stained wood, cushioned chairs, a built in bar that looked like it belonged in a catalog. The yard was designed to host things like this. Alice’s garage, on the other hand, was pure chaos. Couches with uneven legs. A flat screen hung too high. Tools. the permanent smell of weed no matter how much Febreze was sprayed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flipped the sun visor down and opened the mirror. Checked her face, touched up nothing, and took a breath that didn’t help at all before snapping it shut.</p><p> </p><p>She got out of the car.</p><p> </p><p>The driveway crunched under her shoes. Agatha walked straight to the side gate, where laughter spilled louder now, paired with the low thump of bass and someone yelling over a story. She didn’t need to psych herself up or fake a smile. She wasn’t pretending tonight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt like herself.</p><p> </p><p>She slipped through the gate, pulled it shut behind her, and rounded the corner of the house. The backyard unfolded in soft light of string bulbs crisscrossed overhead, a long table set up down the middle of the patio.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Game night.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Half played card games, scattered snacks, drinks abandoned mid conversation. One end was in the middle of Spoons, fast and loud, spoons already missing. The other end hovered around a Jenga tower that looked one breath away from collapsing.</p><p> </p><p>It was messy. Loud, familiar, built from rituals no one had ever written down but everyone followed anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Jen spotted Agatha first. Without a word, she stood, glass already in hand, and met Agatha halfway across the yard.</p><p> </p><p>Whiskey, neat. Just how she liked it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha accepted it without making a joke or a face. She wrapped her fingers around it, nodded once and gave Jen a look that said more than thanks ever could. She reached out to gently squeeze Jen’s arm.</p><p> </p><p>The second Agatha was within sight, someone started clapping, and the rest followed with cheers like she’d just returned from war. She rolled her eyes, flipped them off without breaking stride, as she took a long sip of the drink that warmed her throat on the way down.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped into an empty chair on the end closest to the Jenga game, settling in between Teen, Jen, and Rebecca. Yelena, the RT was perched nearby, offering loaded commentary with a beer in one hand. </p><p> </p><p>It was the safer end of the table. The side that didn’t make Agatha’s stomach knot.</p><p> </p><p>Across the table, on the louder end, sat Alice, Nat, Rio, and Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was surprised to see Sage and Teen were here. Both in their twenties, both smart in ways that snuck up on you. Agatha had gotten to know them slowly over the last five months.</p><p> </p><p>This was the first time Agatha had seen them folded into this part of her life. This table. This crowd. They looked comfortable. Like they belonged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair just enough to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>The Jenga side of the table wasn’t in any particular rush. They were technically still playing, but the game had taken a backseat to the conversation. Moves were spaced out by stories, arguments about movies, updates on hospital drama everyone wanted to hear. Every now and then, someone would make a half hearted reach for a block, pull it with caution, and then immediately forget whose turn was next.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her eyes low, letting the chatter drift over her like white noise, until something in her peripheral caught.</p><p> </p><p>Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She was half turned in her chair, head tilted just enough to listen in on whatever Sage was saying, bright orange WNBA cap pulled low over her eyes. New York Liberty was stamped across her chest in cracked white letters. It was of those vintage t-shirts people buy on eBay, just faded enough to look earned, not ironic. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t see the rest of what Rio was wearing, not from where she was sitting, but she didn’t need to. She knew exactly how this went. Rio would be in jeans, obviously. Probably the same pair she used to throw on without looking. Mid rise, soft, older than they should be. Somehow they would still fit her in the best, most ungodly way. She’d be wearing her usual black Converse too, the ones she refused to replace, scuffed in the same places as ten years ago.</p><p> </p><p>Teen’s voice cut through her thoughts, screeching enough to make her blink. Honestly, she was grateful for the interruption until she started actually listening to what he was saying.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, I’m so happy you decided to come. I know an egregious amount of-”</p><p> </p><p>“Be cool, man,” Agatha muttered, barely moving her mouth. Her lips brushed the rim of her glass as she took sip, eyes narrowing just past the Jenga tower as she tried to steal another glance without making it obvious.</p><p> </p><p>Beside Rio was the woman Agatha had pointedly avoided looking at since she walked through the gate.</p><p> </p><p>She’d known who it was the moment she walked in. Same woman from the parking lot. Same proximity to the one person Agatha had told herself she wasn’t thinking about anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Currently, the woman was laughing at something, her wine glass in hand, elbow resting against the back of Rio’s chair like she belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grimaced and looked away.</p><p> </p><p>Teen, undeterred, kept talking, his words tripping over each other with the confidence of someone who was used to being the youngest at the table and had decided to treat that like a superpower.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked to the far end of the table one more time, then back to her drink. She’d looked long enough for one night.</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, she was back.</p><p> </p><p>No big shift. No deep breath. She just… fell into it. One second she was somewhere else entirely, and the next she was cutting Rebecca off mid sentence and tossing something witty across the table that made Teen nearly fall out of his chair. Jen laughed so hard she wheezed. Yelena rolled her eyes without looking up.</p><p> </p><p>It felt good.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t realized how much she’d missed this. Not just the noise or the inside jokes or the way no one ever passed the popcorn without throwing it but the way her voice still fit here. The way everything picked up when she jumped in, like it was waiting for her.</p><p> </p><p>No one paused to make room for her. She didn’t need them to. She already knew where she sat.</p><p> </p><p>The old Jenga tower in the middle of the table had been left behind hours ago. Now it was just background. Rebecca tapped at one of the blocks absently while she talked, Teen stretched his legs into someone else’s space, and no one told him to move.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled. It came easy and stayed longer than she meant it to.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rebecca, Jen, and Yelena had wandered off somewhere else for a second, which left Billy with no one else to talk at and Agatha with no real excuse to leave. He’d been sitting next to her for twenty minutes, talking without taking so much as a single breath between sentences.  She didn’t mind. He had a way of filling silence that didn’t require much from Agatha. A nod here and there, the occasional hmm to keep him going. He was a good kid, even if she wasn’t really listening.</p><p> </p><p>Across the table, Agatha noticed Sage stand up.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched Sage make her way to their end of the table, a black Juul between her teeth like an unlit cigarette. She stopped next to Billy’s chair, tapped the back of it with her knuckles, and took the vape out of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Move,” Sage said.</p><p> </p><p>Teen looked up, confused. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re in my seat,” she said, nudging his elbow with her hip.</p><p> </p><p>“There aren’t assigned seats,” he snapped, already turning back to Agatha. “Anyway- where were we?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t give Agatha a chance to answer. Not that she could. She had no idea what he’d been rambling about before Sage walked over.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve been talking her ear off for twenty minutes,” Sage said. Then she kicked the leg of his chair. “You’ve had your turn. She looks miserable. Now get up.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy turned to Agatha, offended. “We were having a great conversation,” he said, like he was speaking for both of them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t chime in. She took a sip from her drink and almost laughed.  She hadn’t minded the conversation, but watching them argue was a lot more fun.</p><p> </p><p>“She hasn’t said a single word, dude.” Sage gestured to Agatha with both hands, presenting her evidence. “This isn’t a conversation, it’s a hostage situation.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had to bite back another laugh, which came out as a snort. She covered her mouth with her hand, and when Billy whipped his head toward her, he looked slightly offended. That sure as shit didn’t stop him from doubling down.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s a listener!” he said, talking for her again. “I know that because we’re friends. Plus, she doesn’t like you. She told me.”</p><p> </p><p>Alright- friends was a stretch. A massive one, actually. And Agatha had said no such thing. But judging by the look Sage gave him, she already knew he was full of shit.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at Agatha. “You tell him that?” Sage asked.</p><p> </p><p>The way Sage was looking at her, she knew the girl wasn’t actually asking. Just making sure Billy had an audience when she called him out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t rush to respond. She looked at Sage for a beat, then said, “No.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage looked back to Teen with a smile that was all teeth. “Would you look at that? That’s more than she’s said to you all night. So scram!”</p><p> </p><p>Billy let out a long, dramatic sigh and stood up like he’d finally accepted he wasn’t winning. “Don’t forget we’re going to Eddie’s tomorrow,” he said, standing in front of Sage. “Bring your personality or whatever. I need all the help I can get.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am not a vehicle for you to make out with my friend.”</p><p> </p><p>Teen smiled at Sage and rested a hand on her shoulder, “You kind of are though.”</p><p> </p><p>Then he turned and started toward the other end of the table. “Love you,” he called over his shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Sage sat down next to Agatha and grabbed a handful of popcorn like none of it had happened. After a second, she said, “You’re welcome.”</p><p> </p><p>“Care to explain why the two of you are fighting for my attention tonight?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shrugged. “Billy’s a try-hard and wants you to like him. Me? I just needed an excuse to get away from Amber throwing herself at Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “That bad?”</p><p> </p><p>“She called her mysterious. Twice. Then asked if she’d ever been in handcuffs. I had to get out before I lost my will to live.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t laugh, but her mouth twitched like it wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>That sealed it. If she were ranking the overnight weekend x-ray shift, Sage had just taken the top spot without breaking a sweat.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure how they got here. Sage had pushed her chair back, legs stretched out, looking entirely too relaxed, while Agatha was sitting across from her tossing popcorn at her mouth with questionable aim.</p><p> </p><p>They were asking each other questions now. Stupid ones. To pass the time.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s the most embarrassing interaction you’ve had with a patient?” Agatha asked, tossing another piece of popcorn Sage’s way. It hit her shoulder and rolled off.</p><p> </p><p>“I was sitting in the control booth,” Sage said. “Couldn’t see the guy our assistant brought in from the waiting room- he was in a wheelchair, behind the wall. So I ask, super casually, ‘Are you able to stand for your x-ray?’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could already see where it was going.</p><p> </p><p>“Silence. Like, dead silence. And then he says, ‘I don’t have legs.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p> </p><p>“I shot up like someone lit my ass on fire, looked through the window, and yep. No legs. I think I watched my soul exit my body and take the elevator to the morgue.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lost it. Full laugh, head thrown back, snorting. She fired off another piece of popcorn mid laugh. Sage caught it in her mouth and threw her arms in the air like she’d just won a gold medal.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha doubled over, still laughing. “That’s horrible.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well,” Sage shrugged, still chewing, “it builds character.”</p><p> </p><p>“Does it?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Sage said, deadpan. “I wanted to fling myself off the roof of the hospital.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, finally catching her breath as she tossed another piece of popcorn at Sage. She caught it again and let out a loud whoop. Then came the dance. All limbs and ego, loud enough to turn heads.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed under her breath and grabbed a whole fistful of popcorn, threw it up at her like confetti.</p><p> </p><p>That’s when Agatha felt it.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t need to look to know. Her body already clocked it, same way it always did. Some internal barometer tilted whenever Rio looked at her, like a third eye rolling open, whispering: she’s looking at you.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally looked over, Rio was, of course, already staring at her. She didn’t smile or recoil or pretend to be looking somewhere else. The noise around them kept going. Alice kept talking. Sage was still dancing. Someone dragged a chair across the patio. None of it touched them.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio turned back to the group and let out a soft laugh at whatever Alice had just said. It came a moment too late, like she had to remember where she was.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook it off and forced herself to laugh along with Sage, but it didn’t reach all the way.</p><p> </p><p>Not seventeen minutes later, Rio stood up and walked over.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been right. Same jeans. Same beat up Converse.  All that time, and Rio still moved through the world exactly the way Agatha remembered.</p><p> </p><p>And for a second, that felt unfair.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna take Amber hom-”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank god,” Sage said, cutting Rio off before she could finish.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted before she could stop herself. Tried to cover it with a cough, cleared her throat, and tossed out a half hearted, “Sorry,” in Rio’s direction without bothering to sell it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was looking at Agatha. Her brow was drawn, her mouth tugged upward, like she wasn’t entirely sure what had just happened or why she was reacting to it. It wasn’t quite a smile, not fully, but enough of one to be noticeable.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved her eyes back to Sage.</p><p> </p><p>“You staying or ready for me to drop you off?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized they came to game night together. Thinking back, Sage had spent most of the night near Rio before finally walking over and kicking Billy out of his own chair. Agatha had seen the two women leaving work together a few times too -crossing the parking lot, walking ahead of Agatha in the hall- but Agatha hadn’t given it much thought.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t surprising. Agatha just hadn’t known they were that close. </p><p> </p><p>“Hard pass. I’ll hang out here,” Sage said immediately.</p><p> </p><p>“Cool. I’ll be back in a few,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved to leave but slowed, eyes catching on the Jenga tower on the table. It had been sitting there untouched, half played, half forgotten. Her gaze flicked to Agatha, then back to the stack.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached for a piece.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers slipped around one of the lower corner blocks. It was the riskiest piece left, one someone didn’t touch unless they had something to prove. </p><p> </p><p>There had been a time when Rio would have passed it over without a thought, and wouldn’t care enough to try.</p><p> </p><p>But not tonight.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slid the block free. </p><p> </p><p>The tower wobbled under Rio’s touch, but it held.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned the piece over in her hand a few times, like she hadn’t decided what to do with it yet. For a second, Agatha thought she might set it down, walk away without placing it.</p><p> </p><p>Then she looked at Agatha again.</p><p> </p><p>And placed the block on top of the tower.</p><p> </p><p>The tower didn’t collapse.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She didn’t linger. She glanced once more at Agatha, then walked toward the backyard’s gate where Amber was calling her name.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t ask what it meant. She just watched Rio go, knowing better than to pretend it hadn’t meant anything at all.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>It was Agatha’s last shift of the week. She didn’t have a patient assignment all weekend. She was scheduled as the delivery nurse, which meant she had to stay ready in case a high risk birth came through. The delivery team was made up of people who could keep their heads when things turned sideways and Agatha, for better or worse, had a reputation for thriving in chaos.</p><p> </p><p>If she was paged, she would head straight to the delivery room prepared to take over the moment a baby was born.</p><p> </p><p>Until then, she floated. She stopped by different pods, leaned over shoulders, asked how things were going and actually meant it. If someone needed help with a feed or an IV or a baby who just wouldn’t settle, she stepped in without making a show of it. Sometimes she offered advice no one asked for. Sometimes she handed someone the thing they didn’t realize they needed until it was already in their hand.</p><p> </p><p>Around 1:30 a.m., a trauma page came through: a pregnant woman, twenty-five weeks along, en route to the hospital. There was concern she might deliver before even making it upstairs to Labor and Delivery. Agatha was already moving.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t alone. A whole team moved out at once- an NP, a resident, a fellow, a few NICU nurses, several from labor and delivery. They headed straight for one of the trauma bays in the ED. The patient was seventeen minutes out. Maybe less. Until then, they stood and waited.</p><p> </p><p>Inside the room, things moved quickly. People were already calling out what needed to be ready -warmers, suction, respiratory, lines, someone call x-ray- even though Agatha had already spotted Rio leaning against the wall, arms crossed, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>X-ray always was. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had mentioned it once, years ago. How x-ray always showed up first, stood there for twenty minutes while everyone else tripped over themselves to look useful, then got waved in like they hadn’t been there the whole time. At the time, Agatha had probably rolled her eyes. After that she saw it at every trauma she’d ever gone to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t seen Rio since game night when she left with Amber and came back fifteen minutes later, alone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pretended not to notice. Pretended the relief that hit wasn’t relief at all. Just digestion. Just ambient liquor. Anything but what it actually was. </p><p> </p><p>Though Agatha did the math- fifteen minutes wasn’t enough time to get very far, much less get away with anything. Whatever it was, it didn’t scream passion. It barely even whispered a poor decision.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t speak when Rio got back. But Agatha lingered a little closer than she had before. Close enough to watch Rio reshuffle a deck of cards with an unlit cigarette between her lips. Close enough to join the next round of blackjack, even though Agatha fucking hated blackjack.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lost on purpose… Maybe…  Hard to say.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t think about the Jenga tower.</p><p> </p><p>Not the block Rio had pulled. Not the fact that it was one of the riskiest pieces- one Agatha never would’ve expected her to touch. Not the way Rio had hesitated, turning it over in her hand. And not the way she’d looked at Agatha just before placing it on top, like the act itself might carry more meaning than she was willing to give voice to.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could’ve obsessed over it. Could’ve dissected every second the way she used to when Rio was all questions and no answers, when every silence between them felt like a locked door she hadn’t been given the key to.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let it sit. </p><p> </p><p>A choice, a moment, a tower that didn’t fall.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was Rio’s way of saying something. Or maybe it wasn’t. Maybe it was nothing at all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t need to know.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to keep reading into everything they did or didn’t do. She didn’t want their friendship to be a scavenger hunt for what might still be salvageable. She just missed Rio. Missed who they used to be when it didn’t feel like one wrong move would send everything crashing.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha told herself that not everything needed to be deciphered or had to mean more than it did.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes people just walked away.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes they came back.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes the tower held.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized she was standing still in the middle of the hallway until someone bumped her shoulder on the way past. The nurse aide muttered a quick “sorry” and slipped into the open trauma bay without looking back.</p><p> </p><p>She blinked and the space around her came into focus again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t noticed her yet.</p><p> </p><p>There was no assigned place to stand when a trauma was coming in. No rule about where she should be. The trauma bays stretched out on either side of the hallway, curtains drawn back and waiting. Plenty of places to choose from and stay out of Rio’s way.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t want them to keep dodging each other like this. Didn’t want group nights to feel like a custody arrangement. Didn’t want to keep pretending that closeness had to come with consequence.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha crossed the hallway and made her way to the portable. </p><p> </p><p>She leaned against the portable without looking at Rio, hands tucked into her pockets.</p><p> </p><p>Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Rio shift. Saw the slight turn of her head, the tightening of her jaw like she was half a second away from snapping at whoever thought the x-ray equipment doubled as furniture.</p><p> </p><p>Rio saw who it was and said nothing.</p><p> </p><p>“Can someone call x-ray?” someone shouted from inside the bay.</p><p> </p><p>“They’re already here,” Agatha called back, flat and loud, not bothering to hide the irritation in her voice. Agatha rolled her eyes. It was amazing how people could walk past a machine the size of a chest freezer and still act like it was invisible.</p><p> </p><p>After a breath, she let herself glance sideways.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was already looking at her, the corners of her mouth pulling upward,  trying not to smile.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head away, eyes forward again, but she felt it. That tug of a smile she didn’t bother fighting all the way down.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let it sit. </p><p> </p><p>A choice, a moment, a tower that didn’t fall.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was walking out of the building when her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, thumbed open her messages, and immediately rolled her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Alice had created a group chat. She called it Coven of Chaos. Everyone was in it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Alice: 70s night at The Witches Road on Wednesday. Be there or end up in B Squared.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted under her breath. Stupid joke.</p><p> </p><p>B Squared was what the ED staff called the psych hallway- technically part of B Pod, but set off in its own little corridor in the middle of the department, shaped like a square.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t bother replying. Just started to tuck her phone away when another text came through.</p><p> </p><p>This one was from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Her name lit up the screen like it had never left. Agatha had changed phones at least three times in the last decade, but Rio’s number had always made the jump. She’d never deleted it. Had never even hovered over the option.</p><p> </p><p>The text was three emojis: A knife and two drops of blood.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it for a second, then opened a separate thread. Just the two of them.</p><p> </p><p>It was empty. A blank conversation. No record of what came before. A fresh start, if Agatha wanted to believe in that kind of thing.</p><p> </p><p>She typed quickly and didn’t overthink the words.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Next time wear a neon sign or something.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>There was no explanation attached. She didn’t need one. Rio would know exactly what she meant. The trauma bay. The shouting. The way the entire team acted like x-ray hadn’t been standing there the whole time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slid her phone into her pocket and kept walking.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t check her phone until the alarm blared at noon.</p><p> </p><p>After her third and final night shift of the week, the routine was always the same- go home, crash until noon, then force herself to stay up until at least nine. It was the only way to reset her schedule without spiraling into a four day blackout. Miserable, but necessary. If she didn’t do it, the alternative was she’d sleep through the next four days and wake up just in time to go back to work.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, rubbed at her eyes, already irritated before she was fully conscious. The alarm was too loud, and she was mad at it for doing exactly what she told it to do. She slapped at her nightstand until her fingers found the screen, then tapped it into silence.</p><p> </p><p>After a long breath, she pushed the blankets off and swung her legs out of bed with another groan. She grabbed her phone without looking at it and trudged downstairs, fully prepared to start the day by resenting every second of it.</p><p> </p><p>In the kitchen, she leaned against the counter while the Keurig sputtered to life. The scent hit before the cup was halfway full- burnt, cheap, slightly metallic, like comfort wearing the wrong clothes. She didn’t even like it. But it was what she drank.</p><p> </p><p>She unlocked her phone and scanned the notifications.</p><p> </p><p>One missed spam call. A dozen new texts from the group chat. Two that weren’t.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda and Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha immediately opened the group chat first.</p><p> </p><p>Most of it was chaos- people confirming they’d be at 70s night, half finished inside jokes, photos from the last game night. Agatha scrolled, not expecting to care, until her thumb paused on a picture.</p><p> </p><p>It was her and Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was mid victory dance, arms thrown up in a blur, popcorn suspended in the air around her like confetti. Agatha was laughing- head tilted back, eyes shut, mouth open in a way that made it clear she hadn’t seen the camera and wouldn’t have cared if she had.</p><p> </p><p>She looked happier in that photo than she had in a long time. Happier than any picture from Chicago.</p><p> </p><p>She saved the picture without thinking.</p><p> </p><p>The next photo was from blackjack. Jen must’ve taken it too. Agatha was staring down at her hand, fully focused, bottom lip caught lightly between her teeth. Beside her, Teen was mid eye roll, his chips stacked unevenly. Alice sat next to him mid reach, stealing chips from Teen’s stack. Sage was grinning at the end of the table, one foot on the ground with the other propped on the edge of the table, her cards already tossed. And Rio was in the corner of the frame, legs tucked to her chest, cards already down, both middle fingers lifted toward the camera.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent years trying to replicate this photo- dinners in Chicago, couples’ trips, birthdays. The pictures always looked fine. Beautiful, even. But her posture told the truth. Just a little too careful. A little too aware of where the camera was.</p><p> </p><p>But here, Agatha wasn’t even smiling. She wasn’t performing. She was just in it.</p><p> </p><p>And somehow, that looked closer to joy than anything she’d ever been able to fake.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saved that photo too.</p><p> </p><p>As she scrolled, she saw someone had replied directly to the photo of her and Sage.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>xxx-xxx-xxxx: billy i hope this pisses you off so bad.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Sage. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha saved her contact information, and scrolled further.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Teen: i’m not jealous i just think it’s suspicious how sage only experiences joy when she’s stealing emotionally significant bonding moments between me and agatha.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Teen: fine. IT SHOULD’VE BEEN ME</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, swiped out of the group chat, and opened Wanda’s message first. Bad news before the good, she reasoned.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Wanda M.: I miss you. Call me later?</em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Yuck,” Agatha whispered, staring at Wanda’s message. She grabbed her coffee from where it had just finished brewing on the Keurig and took a sip, hoping it would scald the bad taste left in her mouth from her ex-wife’s text.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had a hunch that game night had already made its way to Instagram. Or Facebook. Or whatever Wanda platform still scrolled like her morning newspaper.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda was chronically online in the worst way. Every meal, every milestone, every moment worth bragging about ended up posted. Agatha couldn’t count the number of times she’d been forced to smile for pictures she hadn’t wanted to take, standing in front of things she hadn’t wanted to see.</p><p> </p><p>She opened her own Facebook app. It hadn’t been touched in years and looked it. Outdated profile picture. A graveyard of old comments she didn’t care to ever look at. She typed in Jen’s name and hit search.</p><p> </p><p>Jen had posted three photos. One of her and Agatha. The popcorn moment with Sage. And a full group picture that happened to include Rio being annoyingly photogenic.  All under a caption so nauseating it should’ve come with a warning label.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>The One Where The Covenless Witch Returns To Her Coven.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>We missed you!!!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>It was the gayest fucking thing Agatha had ever read.</p><p> </p><p>That was all Agatha needed to confirm what she already suspected- Wanda had seen the post. She always saw posts like that. </p><p> </p><p>Kale could’ve posted a blurry picture of Agatha’s elbow and Wanda still would’ve found it within minutes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know what Wanda wanted and didn’t care enough to wonder. Maybe it was jealousy. Maybe guilt. Maybe some twisted attempt to reassert control now that Agatha was- what? Laughing in public? Being in Rio’s general vicinity?</p><p> </p><p>More likely, Wanda had just assumed Agatha would be miserable without her.  Westview never fit into Wanda’s plan. Neither did anything resembling hapiness. And certainly not Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>When the divorce came up, they spoke mostly in terms of logistics. Wanda suggested Agatha should stay in Chicago. Claimed she seemed happier there.</p><p> </p><p>Happier doing what, exactly?</p><p> </p><p>Chicago had offered distraction. Polite conversations, a calendar full of shit that didn’t matter, and enough self restraint to keep from screaming in public.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha only knew two things for sure: Wanda despised Westview.</p><p> </p><p>And Wanda never once tolerated Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out why her ex-wife was suddenly reaching out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t spoken to her since that phone call where Wanda agreed too easily at the idea of them sleeping together again, then pretended to forget the name of the only person she’d ever truly resented.</p><p> </p><p>"I MiSs YoU. CalL mE lAtEr," Agatha mocked, flatly, to no one.</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t to check in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t reply to Wanda’s text. She wasn’t going to. Empty sentiment didn’t warrant a response.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t opened the app in years, hadn’t posted, liked, or reacted to anything. Her profile was a digital ghost town. But if there was even the slightest chance Wanda would see Agatha’s name pop up publicly -proof that Agatha was alive, present, and having a better time than she was supposed to- then yes. Agatha would log in. She would scroll. And she would leave a comment.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s thumbs hovered for a second, then typed the comment.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Happy to be home &lt;3</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her name floated to the top of the post, right where it needed to be.</p><p> </p><p>She slid out of the app, slid down her home screen, and tapped the notifications from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Rio: tried that. didn’t work.</em>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <em>Rio: was thinking a flare gun next time. maybe they’d notice that.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha read it once, then again. And despite everything, she laughed.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t even get a chance to think of a response before Wanda’s contact picture covered her entire screen.</p><p> </p><p>Calling Agatha. Not even five minutes after she commented on Jen’s post.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a groan, took a long sip of coffee, and stared at the phone while it rang. She made no move to answer. When it finally stopped, she set the mug down and finished responding to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Unfortunately, that was funny.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Another text pinged in immediately after- Wanda again.</p><p> </p><p>Because of course it was.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Wanda M.: I saw the post. You look good. Really. Just wanted to hear your voice.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha locked her phone. Set it face down on the counter.</p><p> </p><p>Then it pinged.</p><p> </p><p>Once.</p><p> </p><p>She stared at it for a second. Didn’t move. Didn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>Then she turned it over.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Rio: unfortunately… i’m funny.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it, jaw tight, already annoyed with herself for grinning.</p><p> </p><p>She locked the screen again.</p><p> </p><p>Unlocked it thirty seconds later.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em>Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>She hit send and, without thinking, called Jen.</p><p> </p><p>It rang twice.</p><p> </p><p>“Harkness,” Jen said, voice flat.</p><p> </p><p>“Kale.”</p><p> </p><p>A pause.</p><p> </p><p>“What now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her elbows into the counter and dragged a hand over her face. “Apparently being visible online is a formal invitation for harassment-”</p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzed against her ear. She pulled it away to glance at the notification banner at the top of the screen.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda… Again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, then brought the phone back to her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s blowing up my fucking phone, Jennifer.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t pause before answering. “That’s not new. She pulled the same shit a decade ago.”</p><p> </p><p>“Did she?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Lie.</p><p> </p><p>A big, fat, obvious lie.</p><p> </p><p>Jen snorted. “Don’t bullshit me now, Harkness. You remember exactly what happened. If she so much as heard Rio might be somewhere near you, she’d blow up your phone until you came home.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together. She remembered. Of course she did.</p><p> </p><p>“I think that’s a bit of an exaggeration.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know why she said it. Maybe to cover the fact that she'd treated a parade of red flags like they were love letters.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha. She hated Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, it wasn’t-”</p><p> </p><p>“She said, and I quote, ‘That woman is an evil Skeletor and a very gross person to be around.’”</p><p> </p><p>Silence.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.” Agatha said, already smiling. “Not that I’m defending that, but she’d just watched Rio eat a hot wing, panic, snort milk through her nose, and watched said milk flow out of her mouth and into the kitchen sink.” Agatha paused and sighed, before quickly saying, “It was horrifying and I still think about it… Fondly.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s because it was fucking hilarious,” Jen said, in full defense. “And your ex was.. is....whatever... the biggest buzzkill I’ve ever met.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, “Okay, well. It’s not like anyone told me not to marry her.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t say anything right away. When she did, her voice was quieter. “We tried,” she said. “You just didn’t want to hear it unless it came from her.”</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed and took a sharp inhale, narrowed her eyes at the toaster, “Jennifer…” she sang in a warning lullaby. “Keep talking like that and you’re gonna lose privileges.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said, mocking her song exactly. “The fact I haven’t yet after that last comment already says more than you think.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t argue. She didn’t even deflect.</p><p> </p><p>Jen exhaled, “Wow. So that’s still a thing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rubbed at her forehead, eyes shut tight. “Maybe,” she muttered quietly. </p><p> </p><p>And that was the closest she’d come to telling the truth.</p><p> </p><p>“You still in denial?” Jen asked, tone lighter than the question deserved.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m in denial about a lot of things.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t push. Just pivoted.</p><p> </p><p>“Well… you could come over. I’ve got wine and you have terrible dating apps. We can judge strangers until it feels like therapy.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s one in the afternoon,” Agatha said flatly.</p><p> </p><p>“And?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed. “I’ll be there in twenty.”</p>

  <p>They weren’t even through their second glass of wine, and Agatha was already buzzed enough to stop pretending she had any standards. Their wine glasses had been abandoned on the coffee table entirely forgotten. Agatha and Jen sat shoulder to shoulder, thumbs ruthless. They’d made it through seven strangers on Bumble. Their commentary vicious and their judgment was swift. </p><p> </p><p>Jen suddenly gasped.</p><p> </p><p>Loud. Dramatic. Enough to make Agatha’s stomach drop.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Of course. Of course. </em>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p> </p><p>Rio fucking Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>Typically this was the part where Agatha would hurl her phone into the nearest trash can, or ideally, into another universe, before her rage even had a chance to finish blooming. But there was no rage this time. She didn’t know what she felt. Only that she couldn’t look away from her phone screen.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was staring straight into the camera, head tilted, cheek pressed to her hand. Her elbow rested on a white cube- table? Box? -something intentionally abstract, like it had been staged by someone who understood angles. The lighting was perfect. Too perfect.</p><p> </p><p>Her hair was messily arranged and it screamed effort disguised as accident. A thin gold chain traced the line of her collarbone. She wore black. Thin straps. Low neckline. Could’ve been a dress, could’ve been a tank top, and Agatha hated that she couldn’t tell. She wanted to know. She needed to know how much of Rio’s skin was just out of frame.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked fucking devastating.</p><p> </p><p>Unreasonably so.</p><p> </p><p>Like the photo had been engineered specifically to ruin Agatha Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>“Who took that?” was all Agatha could manage, barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Jen hesitated. “Me?” It came out more like a question than a confession.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head slowly, narrowing her eyes. Jen looked suddenly very interested in the ceiling.</p><p> </p><p>“So,” Agatha said, licking her lips, drawing the pause out like she wasn’t trying at all. “Was she, uh... in a dress? Or was it, like, a tank top and jeans situation?” She even shrugged, casual as hell.</p><p> </p><p>The most casual question in the world… By Agatha’s standards, anyway.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t see why that matters-”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha cut in, too fast. She cleared her throat and tried again, softer this time. “No. It doesn’t. I just... wanted to know. And since you were there, I think you should let me know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for her phone, still in Jen’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>Jen pulled it just out of reach. “Agatha.” Her tone dropped. A warning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head, eyebrows raised in perfect innocence. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t buy it. “What are you going to do?” she asked, slowly, carefully, like she already regretted handing over her wine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at the screen again then shifted her gaze to the traitor sitting beside her. She sucked her teeth, loud enough to make Jen flinch.</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha said, reaching out. “Just give me my phone back.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Jen yanked it farther away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breathy laugh, all disbelief. “Jen. Be serious. Give me my phone.”</p><p> </p><p>“I am being serious. You’re making that face you make before you do something that requires damage control.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not-” Agatha stopped herself. Then, grinning wide, too wide -more wolf than woman- she tilted her head. “Tank top or dress?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not helping your case,” Jen hissed.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Alright. Fuck it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Give me the phone, Jen!” Agatha shouted and launched.</p><p> </p><p>“NO!” Jen shrieked, halfway to scrambling off the couch when Agatha tackled her. They crashed to the floor in a tangle of limbs and shrieking laughter and very real threats.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha!” Jen gasped, utterly betrayed, halfway pinned.</p><p> </p><p>“Give me my fucking phone!” Agatha growled through clenched teeth, wrestling.</p><p> </p><p>“No! This is why I don’t invite you over for wine anymore!” Jen shouted, twisting as Agatha climbed over her. “You get horny and scary and you make terrible decisions!”</p><p> </p><p>“You literally gave me the wine!” Agatha shouted back, lunging again.</p><p> </p><p>“I was trying to be nice!” Jen screeched.</p><p> </p><p>In the mess of limbs and shouting, Agatha somehow managed to knock her phone loose. It slid across the floor out of Jen’s reach. She threw her weight forward, pinning Jen down with her knees bracketing her sides. She grabbed two fistfuls of Jen’s shirt and shook.</p><p> </p><p>“TANK TOP OR DRESS?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s eyes went wide, arms flailing uselessly. “Dress! It was a dress! Jesus, get off me!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha instantly loosened her grip, all menace evaporating into smug satisfaction. “Huh?” she breathed. “See? That wasn’t so hard, was it, Jenny?”</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in and planted a loud, obnoxiously wet kiss on Jen’s cheek then scrambled off her, making a break for her phone.</p><p> </p><p>Jen grabbed for her legs. She almost got Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Almost.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went down hard -elbows first, a short, ugly fall- but didn’t let it stop her. She hit the floor and kept moving, crawling the last few feet because she was a woman on a mission. Her fingers closed around the phone, flipped it over, screen up. She swiped right on Rio’s profile without a moment of hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>A cheerful chime sounded.</p><p> </p><p><b>YOU MATCHED!</b> lit up the top of the screen in big, celebratory letters.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath came in short, uneven bursts, her grin stretched wide and wild as she shoved the phone inches from Jen’s face. “A-ha! Look at that- it’s a match!”</p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t even flinch. “Okay? And?” she snapped, swatting the phone away. “You literally said you just wanted to be friends with her when you got here. Only friends, Agatha. How is this helping that?”</p><p> </p><p>Okay, so maybe Agatha <em> had </em> said that.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe, when she first got there, wine still uncorked and self control fully intact, she did tell Jen she wanted to try being friends with Rio again. That was all. And if anything was going to happen between them, it would only be friendship.</p><p> </p><p>Completely standard. Deeply adult. Uncomplicated platonic friendship.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just... hadn’t expected to see her face. Not like that. Not staring into the camera like she'd been waiting for Agatha to find her. Like the whole profile had been made just to get under her skin. Which, obviously, it hadn’t. <em> Obviously </em>. </p><p> </p><p>Which was so much worse. Because it wasn’t bait. It wasn’t a challenge. It was just Rio on a stupid fucking dating app.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha wasn’t above taking that personally.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well… friends can match! It’s fine. It’s friendly matching.”</p><p> </p><p>And there it was again- the Nile, in all its slow, inevitable glory. Still Agatha’s favorite vacation spot, apparently.</p><p> </p><p>In Agatha’s defense -because someone had to defend her, and it sure as hell wasn’t going to be Jen- she had also mentioned, on the phone earlier, that she was in denial about a lot of things. That wasn’t a secret. It was a disclaimer. A legal warning, if you will.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god, Agatha,” Jen said, flat on her back, staring up at her in disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha snapped. “I’m not going to message her. I just needed to know if she swiped right. That’s all. It’s perfectly reasonable.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen looked unconvinced.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept going. “And she did. So now I know. It’s not weird. It’s not anything. It’s just... confirmation.”</p><p> </p><p>“Confirmation,” Jen repeated, deadpan.</p><p> </p><p>“That we can be friends,” Agatha clarified.</p><p> </p><p>Jen gawked at her. “So let me get this right. You needed to match with your ex-... not-ex… almost… whatever the fuck <em> that </em>situation is- to confirm that being just friends is on the table?”</p><p> </p><p>“Bingo, Jennifer.” Agatha pointed at Jen, triumphant. “See? You’re catching on.”</p><p> </p><p>“That doesn’t make any sense!” Jen snapped, her arms flailing like she was trying to physically beat Agatha’s logic out of the air.</p><p> </p><p>“It does if you’re a student of platonic dynamics.” Agatha fired back, dead serious.</p><p> </p><p>“What the hell happened?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned fast. Alice stood in the entryway, wide eyed and frozen. Jen was already sitting up beside her, rubbing her ribs, blinking at the mess like she wasn’t entirely sure how they got there.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha barely registered either of them. Just sat there, wild haired and wide eyed, trying not to betray the very obvious fact that she had completely lost control of the situation.</p><p> </p><p>Because standing just behind Alice was Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped. Her mind blanked. Her heart was now sitting firmly in her ass. All the air she thought she’d been breathing was ripped from her lungs on sight.</p><p> </p><p>And then Agatha’s brain started defending itself.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t swiped because she cared. Obviously. She swiped because she was curious. And curiosity didn’t mean interest, it meant stability. That she could look the past in the eye and walk away from it. She just needed to know if Rio had swiped too. That was it. Nothing dramatic. Nothing romantic. Just proof they were both adults. That the door was shut. That it had always been shut. That they were... whatever.</p><p> </p><p>Fine. Friends. Colleagues.</p><p> </p><p>And if Rio had swiped first? That meant she was the one hanging on, not Agatha. If it was mutual, then it didn’t count. It canceled itself out. It proved the opposite of what it looked like. It was math.</p><p> </p><p>So, no- Agatha didn’t regret it. She was gathering evidence. Scientific. Reasonable. Completely detached.</p><p> </p><p>Until said evidence showed up in the doorway.</p><p> </p><p>Now the living room looked like a crime scene. Jen was holding her side. Alice was still blinking at the mess. Wine pooled beneath the table. Agatha hadn’t even realized her sweatshirt had slipped halfway off her shoulder. She looked feral.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio was just standing there. Quiet. Watching.</p><p> </p><p>She scanned Rio instinctively. No phone in hand. No screen. No proof she’d seen it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Good. Small miracles. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Agnes is what happened,” Jen announced, far too pleased with herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jabbed a finger in her direction. “I told you to stop calling me that.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agnes O’Conor.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had nothing kind to say about her. She hated that woman with a fucking passion.</p><p> </p><p>Fourteen years ago, after several regrettable glasses of boxed wine, Jen, Alice, and Rio had named the monster that crawled out when Agatha tipped past her third glass.</p><p> </p><p>Jen wasn’t wrong, though. Wine, any kind of wine, turned Agatha into a terrifying, unhinged gremlin of a person. Horny, reckless, emotionally dangerous. Agnes had no filter, no self preservation instinct, and an alarming tendency to drag Agatha’s worst secrets into the light just to watch them burn.</p><p> </p><p>Yeah. Agnes had made an appearance today. But right now, Agatha was painfully sober.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked back at Rio, who had tucked her hands into the back pockets of her jeans and was rocking absently on the balls of her feet. Her lips were pulled into her mouth, either to hide a grin or to trap whatever stupid question she was dying to ask that would absolutely, without fail, piss Agatha off.</p><p> </p><p>Possibly both.</p><p> </p><p>Alice let out a low whistle. “Hurricane Agnes makes landfall.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look away from Rio. “Don’t,” she warned, already seeing the gears turning behind Rio’s eyes. “Whatever you’re about to say, swallow it. Along with your pride, your smugness, and preferably yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised her hands in mock surrender, lips twitching but silent.</p><p> </p><p>That counted as a win.</p><p> </p><p>So of course Rio had to ruin it by stepping back, stretching her arms overhead like she had nowhere better to be, and casually announced, “I, uh… I think I’m gonna step out for a smoke.”</p><p> </p><p>The second the door clicked, Agatha shot to her feet. “Are you fucking kidding me, Alice?”</p><p> </p><p>Alice shrugged. “What? The Liberty play at four.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She followed Rio out the door before she could think better of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweet. Nothing I love more than scrubbing Merlot out of a rug!” Jen called out after her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had no plan. She didn’t know what she came out here to do. Damage control? Maybe. That would’ve required forethought, which wasn’t exactly her strong suit today.</p><p> </p><p>She turned the corner of the house and there was Rio. Leaning against the brick, one foot kicked up behind her, cigarette burning steady between her fingers. Both hands held her phone too close to her face. Her expression was still, it meant she was reading something twice to make sure it was real.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t need to ask what it was. She already knew.</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, this felt worse than if Rio had been laughing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio startled, just barely but it was there. She stuck the cigarette between her lips and she fumbled with her phone, shoving it into her back pocket with all the grace of someone pretending it hadn’t been the most interesting thing in the world thirty seconds ago.</p><p> </p><p>She took a slow drag from her cigarette, eyes forward now, like Agatha hadn’t just caught her seeing exactly what she came out here to deny.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t call her on it.</p><p> </p><p>She walked up instead and nodded toward the cigarette between Rio’s fingers. “Can I bum one?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio eyed her for a second, then pulled the pack from her pocket and tapped one loose without a word. She passed it over, cigarette still balanced between her own lips, eyes already moving somewhere else as she shoved the pack away again.</p><p> </p><p>“Thought you were too good for Spirits now?” Rio muttered around the cigarette, then reached up and pulled it free.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “A light?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio reached into her front pocket and pulled out a lighter. She sparked the flame without looking at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in and stopped.</p><p> </p><p>It was small. Purple metal. Still carried that soft shine underneath the years of being carried, dropped, and used. And on the side, scratched faint but permanent: <em>A.H. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t seen it in over a decade. But Rio had held onto it. Protected it, maybe. Or just refused to let it go. </p><p> </p><p>Her eyes narrowed in on Rio, who was suddenly interested in everything but Agatha. She drew back from the flame, took the first drag, and tried to focus on the burn in her lungs instead of what keeping something like that for so long meant.</p><p> </p><p>It didn't help.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t touched an American Spirit in ten years, and now every part of it felt like Rio- the paper, the pull, the way it sat heavy in her chest like it belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>It was years of watching Rio light one without thinking. The way she would lean out of a window like she owned the sky. The way the scent would cling to her hoodie for days. It would be in the sleeves Agatha would borrow, in the collar she’d adjust without meaning to, in the room long after Rio had gone.</p><p> </p><p>There was a time when Agatha told herself she hated it. The smell. The mess. The presence it left behind. But that had always been a lie. What she hated was how much of Rio lingered- how even absence could feel that fucking loud.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, smoke curling over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“You still carry that thing around?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pocketed the lighter like there was a risk Agatha might ask for it back if she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“You left it at my place.” Rio shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ignored the way it made her feel. It didn’t matter. Not when there were more pressing matters at hand- like Agatha’s most mortifying decision to date that was currently tucked into Rio’s back pocket.</p><p> </p><p>“We gonna pretend you were checking the weather, or are we finally gonna talk about the second elephant in the room?” Agatha tipped her chin toward the mascot stamped across Rio’s shirt - Ellie the Elephant, smiling too fucking wide.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth pulled into a slow smirk. She brought the cigarette to her lips, took her time, exhaled smoke through her teeth. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p> </p><p>Of course she didn’t. Rio would rather chew rocks than make anything easy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “What were you looking at?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio flicked her eyes over Agatha, still smirking. “Why do you care, Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p><em> Agatha </em>.</p><p> </p><p>The way Rio said it had every part of Agatha’s traitorous brain dropped to its knees and begged for more. Heat shot down her spine and she hated herself so much she could almost see stars. She locked her jaw so she wouldn’t do something fucking humiliating, like tell Rio to say her name again - slower this time, closer this time. Instead, Agatha breathed through her nose and glared, holding on to her last shred of dignity with bloody nails.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t care,” Agatha said, too fast and far too loud. She shoved a hand through her hair, scraping her scalp. “Why would I? It’s your phone. You could’ve been checking the weather, Googling how to fake your own death, swiping right on every brunette in Jersey- I’d sleep like a baby.” She shrugged. “Honestly, I hope you were. Wouldn’t want you getting the wrong idea.” She smiled, quick and mean. “But I couldn’t care less.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio watched her, smiling now. She nodded, easy, unbothered, handing Agatha the rope and daring her to hang herself with it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a slow drag from her cigarette, eyes fixed on the pavement. “Look,” she said, “I’m not trying to make this weird.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tipped her head, already amused. “You’re doing a phenomenal job.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped the cigarette, crushed it under her heel, crossed her arms tight. “I think we should be friends again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. Something flickered across her face. She looked away, gave a low huff of a laugh, and when she turned back, whatever it was had been tucked neatly out of sight.</p><p> </p><p>“You told me to back off,” Rio reminded Agatha calmly.</p><p> </p><p>She snapped her head to Rio, her mouth already moving. “Well, you didn’t exactly fight it.” She blew out a breath, tried to scrape together whatever chill she had left, and kept going. “I don’t want to keep doing this. I’m tired of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tired of what?”</p><p> </p><p><em> Stupid question </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scowled at Rio. “Of seeing you every day and pretending you’re a stranger. You were my best friend. You don’t get to just-“ She broke off, biting it back, swallowing it down. “The last decade, the last five months… it was stupid. I hated it.”</p><p> </p><p>“I get it,” Rio said quietly. “I hated it too.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good. Because it’d be weird otherwise.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her eyebrows. “It’s already weird.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed. “You’re not helping.”</p><p> </p><p>“Just setting realistic expectations.” Rio took a drag of her cigarette, looking smug. “You know. As your very platonic friend.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha forced a breath through her nose.</p><p> </p><p><em> Platonic </em>.</p><p> </p><p>That word still had teeth. All these years later, it could still sink in, still tear at the places she thought had hardened over.</p><p> </p><p>That was what they had always been. Perfectly platonic, painfully careful. Two cowards orbiting the same fire, pretending they couldn’t feel the heat. They’d become experts at it because it was easier than wrecking the only thing they had ever gotten right.</p><p> </p><p>And still, even playing it safe, they found a way to lose each other.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean it,” Agatha snapped. “No weirdness. No… tension. None of the old bullshit.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio tilted her head, studying her. “You want to be friends again?” She said slowly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened.</p><p> </p><p>Friends were safe. Friends were manageable.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held Rio’s gaze, refusing to flinch. “I want you back in my life.”</p><p> </p><p>“Friends, then.” Rio’s mouth pulled into a wide grin, flashing that familiar gap between her teeth. Agatha ignored the way her chest tightened at the sight.</p><p> </p><p>“Friends,” Agatha echoed, the oldest lie she knew by heart.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Sinner, you better get ready. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio: are you coming to The Road for 70s night </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the text. Jen and Alice had been quite annoying about it the last few days. Said the bar missed her. Said it wasn’t the same without her. And clearly it had worked, because she was currently standing in her bathroom, getting ready anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Theme nights used to be her thing. She crushed them, every time- costumes, energy, all of it. Of course, it was never Wanda’s scene. Her ex-wife liked velvet ropes and overpriced cocktails and any place that had a dress code longer than the menu. Agatha used to pretend she didn’t miss the dive bars and the chaos that came with it. Agatha wasn’t in Chicago anymore. She didn’t have to pretend.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha typed out a quick reply.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Maybe. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She and Rio had been doing the friend thing for a whole two days now, which mostly meant not making it weird. After their talk on Monday, Rio had asked if she wanted to stick around and watch the basketball game with her and Alice and Jen. Agatha said yes. It went… well. They kept to opposite corners of the couch, traded jokes, let it be easy. It was nice. It was normal. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t realized she missed until it was handed back to her, smaller than before, but still warm in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>She shoved her phone aside, screen down, and leaned back toward the mirror to finish her makeup.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha strolled into the bar, Alice and Jen trailing behind her in their seventies best. The place was already alive, disco balls spinning from the ceiling and throwing fractured light across the walls. ABBA blasted from the speakers. </p><p> </p><p>Clusters of people were packed around the bar. Yelena, Billy, a few faces she half recognized from the hospital. Glitter and sequins everywhere. No one half assed it tonight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t any waste time. She made straight to the bar, boots tapping against the floor, her sheer black cape trailing behind her. Her sleeveless blazer hung open down the front, nothing underneath, the gold embroidery glinting every time the lights spun overhead. Her gold sequined pants caught the glow of the disco ball, flashing with every step. Fingerless mesh gloves and a decorated headband tied around her forehead finished her look.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t bother scanning the room. She already knew. Agatha felt it the second she walked in, the burn dragging across her body. Those brown eyes always managed to find Agatha first.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Some things never change. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled to herself and kept moving toward the bar without missing a step.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha! You look amazing!” Billy shouted from his stool, practically vibrating with excitement.</p><p> </p><p>“Thanks,” she said, giving him a quick once-over. He was drowning in a massive, fluffy blue jacket that looked like it belonged on a parade float. “You look… warm.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why, thank you,” he said brightly, smoothing a hand down the front of his buttoned up shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flagged down the bartender without missing a beat and ordered a whiskey, neat. </p><p> </p><p>She turned and leaned back against the bar, one elbow resting behind her, waiting for her drink. Agatha immediately found the brown eyes she had felt burning into her since the second she walked through the fucking door. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was standing at a high top table with Rebecca, Sage, and now Alice. Her gaze dragged down the line of Agatha’s body lingering on every inch of exposed skin. Her mouth was parted, chest rising under the sheer black fabric, hand curling uselessly around her beer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back a little more against the bar, let the lights catch the gold on her hips, let Rio look for as long as she wanted. She didn’t see any harm in letting Rio stare. They were friends.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was dressed in a sheer black jumpsuit, the fabric clinging tight to her frame. The neckline plunged deep down her chest. Gold and silver diamonds in the shapes of flowers spiraled over the entire body suit, glittering in the scattered lights. A matching hood was pulled up over her hair.</p><p> </p><p>The clink of glass against the bar top pulled Agatha back. She dragged her gaze away and turned, just as the bartender slid her drink across the counter toward her.</p><p> </p><p>“Want to start a tab?” he asked, already reaching for the register.</p><p> </p><p>“Put it on mine, Max!” An unfamiliar voice came from somewhere to Agatha’s left.</p><p> </p><p>Max gave a quick nod and moved down the bar.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head and found a blonde woman sitting on the next stool over. Definitely not someone she recognized. Attractive. Dressed head to toe in full seventies flair- suede vest, flared pants, the whole deal.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dragged her drink closer, unbothered. She was single now, and she sure as hell wasn’t in the business of turning down free whiskey.</p><p> </p><p>“You work at the hospital?” the woman asked, twirling the straw around her glass.</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha smiled and plucked the tiny stir stick from her own drink, biting down lightly on the end. “You?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nah,” the woman said, smiling back at her. “Rebecca dragged me out. I’m a sucker for a good theme night.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her eyes drift over the woman’s suede vest again, then flicked them back up to meet her gaze. “Clearly.”</p><p> </p><p>The woman laughed and shifted closer, casual enough to pass for friendly if anyone was watching but not subtle enough to miss.</p><p> </p><p>“Making new friends without me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head, and found Rio standing there, hood pushed down around her shoulders, her hair pulled back into a low bun. A pink flower was tucked into it. Her gaze flicked once to the blonde, before settling back on Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Something about the way Rio had looked caught Agatha off guard- her eyes darker than usual, jaw clenched just slightly like she was holding something back.</p><p> </p><p>It stole the breath from Agatha’s lungs and left her stomach lurching in a way that felt both familiar and entirely new.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could open her mouth to respond, Rio reached out and wrapped her fingers loosely around her wrist, tugging Agatha gently.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” Rio said, her voice easy. “You’re wasting your time down here. Drinks are better at the other end.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could have stayed. She could have shrugged off the hand on her wrist, offered some excuse, reclaimed her drink, and let the woman at the bar keep flirting. </p><p> </p><p>Instead, she let Rio pull her away, pretending it didn’t mean anything. Pretending she hadn’t seen that look before, a thousand times, and known better than to call it anything. A look that Rio always held at a distance. A look that never asked, never offered. Only lingered until it faded.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught a last glimpse of her drink sitting on the bar where she hadn’t realized she left it, forgotten. The woman Agatha had been talking to was still there, turned slightly, eyes following them through the crowd with a look Agatha couldn’t quite interpret and didn’t try to.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Agatha wasn’t sure who she had walked away from, only that she hadn’t hesitated.</p><p> </p><p>It was pathetic, really- how easily she left. How little it took. No resistance, no second thought. Just a hand at Agatha’s wrist and whatever instinct that lived in her bones, telling her to follow Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned forward again and kept walking. And as she walked, she swallowed the humiliating truth that it would have taken just as little ten years ago.</p><p> </p><p>The noise of the bar washed over them, people shifting around them, and Agatha let it, let it distract her from the fact that nothing about this felt normal, not even close.</p><p> </p><p>They were halfway to the other end when she felt Rio’s hand sliding down from her wrist, slipping into her palm, and tangling their fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked once, kept walking, kept pretending she understood what was happening even though every part of her brain was stuck on the feeling of their hands linked together.</p><p> </p><p>When they reached the far end, Rio finally let go, the absence almost worse than the touch. She barely had time to gather herself before Rio flagged down the same bartender who had served Agatha earlier and tapped two fingers lightly against the counter.</p><p> </p><p>“Another whiskey, neat,” Rio said, then added, “and a Dos Equis.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed because- <em> seriously, what the fuck just happened? </em></p><p> </p><p>The bartender looked up. “You want it dressed?”</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t ask about the drink Agatha had left behind at the other end, still sweating on the bar having been abandoned mid conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes- wait. No. No I- just no.” The words came tumbling out of Rio's mouth.</p><p> </p><p>The bartender nodded and turned away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing, but her eyes flicked toward Rio. </p><p> </p><p>She knew what that had been. A half step forward. A reach. An attempt. </p><p> </p><p>No matter what, Rio never ordered her beers dressed. She actually preferred it that way, but Rio hated how the salt and lime juice made the bottle sticky, which made her hands sticky, which meant the salt stuck to her lips. It was a whole chain reaction she refused to deal with.</p><p> </p><p>So Rio avoided it. Every time.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t about preference. It was about control. Quiet, specific, and impossible not to notice once you knew her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha for a second before she looked away and wiped her palms against her thighs, like the idea of a dressed beer bottle had already started to cling to her hands. Agatha caught the way she bit the inside of her cheek, trying not to look embarrassed at the fact that at her grown age Rio should have outgrown the inability to tolerate something as small as a sticky drink.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha had never cared about Rio’s quirks. Not the hand wiping. Not the need to keep things clean, even if it meant stripping the pleasure out of something she otherwise enjoyed. If anything, Agatha had always understood it. They made sense in a way most things didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>It was just a maddening fucking coincidence that it happened to reflect a much bigger, far more frustrating pattern of Rio's that Agatha still hadn’t entirely made peace with.</p><p> </p><p>The bartender slid their drinks across the bar, which gave Agatha just enough time to pretend she wasn’t on the verge of picking apart the way Rio had almost ordered her beer dressed, then bailed on it at the last second. She didn’t think about how Rio had clearly been trying to prove something again, or how pissed off and embarrassed Rio looked at herself when she couldn’t follow through.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for her glass with one hand, thoughtlessly, then she felt the faintest touch at her other wrist hanging loosely at her side. A single finger, light and careful. Agatha froze for half a second to make sure she wasn’t imagining it.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s touch was enough to be dismissed as incidental, but also lingered long enough to ask.</p><p> </p><p>This was fine. Completely fine. Friends held hands. That was normal. Probably even healthy. Certainly more normal than being cockblocked by said friend in a bar. This, at least, had plausible deniability. </p><p> </p><p>So, for the second time that night, Agatha allowed Rio to take it, offering the smallest twitch of her wrist as her answer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabbed her beer off the bar, then took Agatha’s hand, lacing their fingers together. With their drinks in hand, Rio led them back toward the high top where she’d been sitting before. Sage was still there, sipping her beer, but now the table had filled- Jen, Alice, and Teen had joined.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her hand slip from Rio’s just before they reached the table. She didn’t need anyone asking questions she technically had answers to but didn’t feel like saying out loud. They were friends. Friends who, completely incidentally, had held hands twice in one night, only two days into deciding that they were friends again. It wasn’t complicated unless someone -specifically Agatha's very lovely friend,  Jen- decided to make it complicated. Jen didn’t understand what it meant to reconnect with someone after ten years. She didn’t get that this was normal. Hand holding was friendly. Familiarity was not a crime. And Agatha was absolutely not being delusional about this.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped into the empty seat beside Rio just as Billy launched into full dramatics, attempting to shove Sage out of the chair she was already sitting in to Agatha’s left.</p><p> </p><p>“Come on,” he whined. “You got her at game night. It’s my turn.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t argue. She rolled her eyes and circled the high top, grabbing her beer on the way. She climbed into the chair Billy had been in, one leg settling underneath her as she leaned forward and rested her elbows on the table.  At some point, Alice had handed over her rose colored sunglasses because now they rested on Sage’s face.</p><p> </p><p>It was loud. Not just music loud, but crowded table loud. Jokes overlapped, drink orders were shouted over shoulders, and laughter came in snorts, wheezes, and full body cackles that no one bothered to contain. Teen would not stop talking. Sage kept interrupting him just often enough to tangle the details in his own story, which, bless her, left Agatha free to lean toward Rio with a grin already forming. </p><p> </p><p>They swapped comments, half teases, and dumb observations that got funnier the longer they spiraled. At one point, Rio nearly choked on her beer. At another, Agatha had to grip the edge of the table to keep from doubling over. Across the table, Alice and Jen had fully committed to singing Dancing Queen directly at each other, painfully off key and with way too much eye contact, like they were performing a duet at gunpoint. It was a mess. A perfect one.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, Rio and Sage were shouting at each other from across the table about whether or not it was acceptable to send transport for a patient at three in the morning for a non-stat spine x-ray.</p><p> </p><p>“No one wants to be dragged out of bed for a routine spine at 3am,” Sage snapped, clearly appalled that this needed to be explained.</p><p> </p><p>Rio went right back at her. “If the order’s in, I’m sending for it. I’m not ignoring it just because everyone’s tired.”</p><p> </p><p>That should have been it.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Then kept blinking as the volume climbed. They were interrupting each other, adding new points, dragging in unrelated grievances from god knows when.</p><p> </p><p>Sage leaned in, halfway to launching herself over the table. Rio cracked her knuckles and waved Sage forward like she was welcoming the fight.</p><p> </p><p>They fought like sisters. That was the only way Agatha could make sense of it. Not polite or performative, just loud and comfortable and completely without boundaries. Probably the result of too many night shifts stacked side by side, too many shared patients, too many weekends where no one else showed up. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Jen still bickered the same way. Still found each other in the middle of a shift to complain, still argued over protocol... or a Bumble match just to pass the time.</p><p> </p><p>No one else reacted. Jen took another sip of her drink. Alice and Billy were still wrapped up in whatever nonsense they’d been talking about for the past twenty minutes. </p><p> </p><p>Once it was clear no one else was bothered, Agatha stopped trying to make sense of it. Apparently, this behavior was just part of the atmosphere.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, it was kind of impressive.</p><p> </p><p>And it was easily the funniest thing Agatha had seen all night.</p><p> </p><p>So when there was barely a breath between points, Agatha leaned in and calmly said, “I mean… Sage has a point.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t care. She didn’t even know what they were really arguing about anymore. But the way Rio’s head snapped toward her- eyes wide, mouth slightly open, genuinely offended? That made it worth it.</p><p> </p><p>So worth it, Agatha had to purse her lips and stare down at the nearly finished whiskey in her hand, still resting on the table, just to keep from laughing.</p><p> </p><p>That was when Yelena Belova walked up and stopped in front of their table, directly in front of Sage, and stared at her.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone at the table went quiet. Not gradually- instantly. Whatever conversation Billy had been loudly butchering cut off with a weird little choking noise. Jen froze with her glass hovering halfway to her lips, and Alice stopped drumming her fingers against the table and actually turned in her seat and grinned.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had no idea why everyone at the table was suddenly acting like a bomb had landed in Sage’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena didn’t greet anyone. Didn’t glance at the others. Just stared at Sage and said, flatly, in that thick, unimpressed accent, “You always look like you’re about to say something stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage blinked and straightened in her seat. “Hello to you too,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena stood there a moment longer, eyes fixed on Sage. </p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t squirm.</p><p> </p><p>Yelena gave the faintest tilt of her head and said, “Buy me a drink.” She immediately turned away and walked off without waiting for a reply.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched Sage track her through the crowd, eyes getting wider the further Yelena disappeared.  She didn’t blink. Didn’t breathe. Just stared like she’d witnessed the heavens part.</p><p> </p><p>Then, suddenly, Sage launched to her feet- balancing on the foot rest of her high top chair and shouted, “HELLLLL YEAH!”</p><p> </p><p>The table exploded. Jen screamed into her glass. Alice whooped and slammed her hands on the table while Teen joined, laughing so hard he nearly fell out of his chair. Even Rio clapped.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt Rio lean in close. She turned her head just as Rio murmured near her ear, grinning. “Let me introduce you to the longest, saddest slow burn I’ve ever witnessed. She starts to foam at the mouth anytime Yelena’s in a five foot radius.”</p><p> </p><p>That’s fucking rich coming from Rio of all people, but Agatha doesn’t say that. Thankfully, Sage cuts in before she has to bite her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Sage dropped back into her seat and shot Rio a look as she reached for her beer. “Yeah. I have fucking eyes. She’s hot, she’s mean to me, and I’ve been trying very hard to get into her pants for the last two years.”</p><p> </p><p>Alice didn’t even look up, just raised her drink and said, “That’s only the second most tragic thing I’ve ever heard.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha shot matching glares across the table at Alice, who raised both hands in surrender, a smirk tugging at her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“She says that with love,” Jen offered, tipping back her drink. “We’ve all been forced to watch a shit show go down like this twice.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t laugh. She reached for her glass, fingers brushing the rim but not lifting it. Rio shifted beside her, barely, but Agatha felt it.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t look at each other, but the silence said enough. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a swig of her whiskey as Rio let out a breath through her nose and leaned in again, voice low, just for Agatha. “By ‘get into her pants,’ Sage means loiter until Yelena tells her to shut up and go walk into traffic.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted into her drink. “So that was flirting?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s foreplay, sweetheart. Don’t act surprised.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned toward her, and Rio didn’t move. She was closer than she needed to be. Her thigh brushed against Agatha’s under the table, not by accident.</p><p> </p><p>That smile was still there, but it wasn’t bait. It was quiet, steady, and so familiar it made Agatha’s chest tighten. There was nothing flippant in it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look away. Her fingers were still curled loosely around her glass, but she could feel the warmth radiating from where Rio’s arm hovered just near hers.</p><p> </p><p>Sage promptly ripped Agatha out of her half second of pining. “She just told me to buy her a drink,” Sage announced, pointing after Yelena with her beer. “That’s new. That’s progress.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ripped her eyes away from Rio’s brown and cleared her throat, shaking her head hoping that it might reset her pulse.</p><p> </p><p>Sage took a long sip to finish what was left of her beer, thudded the bottle back onto the table, and stood abruptly. “Now, if you don’t mind, I will be happily spending the rest of the night being bullied by a hot blonde with a sexy accent.”</p><p> </p><p>Already halfway into the crowd, Sage called back, “If I don’t make it back alive, just know I died doing what I loved.”</p><p> </p><p>“Finally,” Teen muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Alice leaned back with a sigh. “God, I hope she gets laid.”</p><p> </p><p>“Assuming she survives,” Jen added.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want to come with me to the bar? Get another round?” Rio asked, quietly to Agatha.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha nodded and stood. Rio followed and moved to step in front of Agatha. She drifted backward into the crowd, walking in reverse, hand outstretched and a grin pulling at her lips.</p><p> </p><p> Agatha looked at Rio, unimpressed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wiggled her fingers, coaxing. “Come on. Wouldn’t want my friend getting lost in this massive crowd.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave Rio another dry look and pushed past her without answering. But as she passed, she caught Rio’s wrist and pulled her along, weaving them both through the flood of bodies until they reached the bar.</p><p> </p><p>They stood shoulder to shoulder, music pulsing through the room, waiting as the bartender worked his way down the line. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha noticed the slight tightness in Rio’s jaw when she notice Rio's gaze flicked over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Curious, Agatha turned and immediately spotted the woman who had flirted with her earlier, leaning casually against the bar, watching them with faint amusement. The same woman Rio had effortlessly cut off from Agatha the first time.</p><p> </p><p>“Rebecca’s friend is incredibly boring, by the way. Extremely unlikable. A real snooze fest,” Rio said, eyes still on the woman.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her lip, turning back to find Rio looking genuinely offended on her behalf as a matter of principle. Agatha narrowed her eyes, though the smile tugging at her mouth was already betraying her.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh really?” Agatha said, arching a brow. “Well, I wouldn’t know. Someone very irritating pulled me away before I could form an opinion.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio's tongue was pressed firmly into her cheek, “Take my word for it.” Then she threw her head back and groaned into the air, “She is laaaame!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but Rio leaned in just slightly, grinning. “Come on. You should be thanking me- I did you a favor.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a loud and genuine laugh. “You cockblocked me, you asshole!”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?” Rio hollered, cupping a hand to her ear like an old man. “Didn’t quite catch that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her for a second. She could feel the edge of her own tongue pressing against the inside of her bottom lip, holding there, thinking too hard about something Agatha shouldn’t want.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still grinning at her, still standing there like a dumbass, showing off that pathetic gap in her teeth that Agatha hated that she fucking loved. And suddenly, Agatha-</p><p> </p><p>Well, Agatha wasn’t in the mood to be good.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Goddamn it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha could play a little. They were friends. And the Road- well, the Road could be Switzerland tonight. Friendship Switzerland. No rules. No consequences.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in, close enough for her mouth to brush the shell of Rio’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand immediately found the small of Agatha’s back, fingers sliding into place like they belonged there. She tugged Agatha closer, until her front was flush against Rio's side.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled. Her breath hitched on the way out.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t push it,” Agatha murmured, lips brushing against Rio’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to look at Agatha. Her brown eyes were low, unfocused for a second, and she gave a few small nods- like she was trying to get ahead of whatever was building inside her. Agatha could feel it humming off of Rio, barely contained.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio looked back up, her gaze had shifted. Darker now. Focused.</p><p> </p><p>“Push what?” Rio whispered, voice soft and almost sweet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha never wanted to hear anything that wasn’t said exactly like that again.</p><p> </p><p>Her own personal Switzerland- a nation founded on denial, pretending things didn’t matter, and quite literally the loosest interpretation of friendship imaginable.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha’s Switzerland? It didn’t recognize war crimes.</p><p> </p><p>“You cockblocked me?” Agatha asked, breath catching halfway through the words. And yes- it was a question. A real one.</p><p> </p><p>All Agatha could hear in her head was the sound of her own irritating voice, chanting:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Say it. Admit it. Tell me you were jealous. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, not smug this time. Not shit eating. It was big, wide, genuine, and it hit Agatha like a surge of current, live wires sinking through her chest, tearing down her ribs and soaring straight into her gut.</p><p> </p><p>Seventeen seconds ago, Rio’s body had been radiating pure, unfiltered filth. This? This was worse.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. I did.”</p><p> </p><p>And in Agatha’s mind, the most obscene moan tore through her like a fucking church bell- high, sharp, and all song. She swallowed it down, hard, forced a hum, narrowed her eyes, tried to look uncertain. Agatha tried, <em> desperately</em>, to look like she absolutely wasn’t five seconds from blowing up seventeen years of discipline just to chase Rio's smile with her own.</p><p> </p><p>The most humiliating part? Agatha wasn’t even drunk. Neither of them were. They were both still nursing the same drink they’d each gotten together earlier, waiting at the bar to order another.</p><p> </p><p>There was no blur, no excuse. Just Agatha's own heart, loud and traitorous, the same goddamn thing that had always clawed and screamed for Rio like it didn’t know better. Always pulled toward her. Always made Agatha angle her body just enough to hide the way it wanted more.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Seventeen years. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The number scraped down the inside of her skull like a dare.</p><p> </p><p>It whispered, ‘<em> haven’t you waited long enough?’ </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed Rio to keep talking. Because she wouldn’t ask. She refused to beg.</p><p> </p><p>There was still time for Rio to pull back, and Agatha knew it- could feel the possibility of it vibrating in her bones.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha did what she always did. Handed over  the exact opposite of what she meant to the universe, like it was a trade. Like if Agatha pretended hard enough not to want it, just this once, maybe it wouldn’t be taken away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still looking at her like there was nothing in the world worth hiding from.</p><p> </p><p>That made Agatha's stomach drop.</p><p> </p><p>The longer Rio chose not say anything, Agatha's heart had felt it had screamed loud enough to be heard, it was losing its voice. It had clawed too hard, too fast, and it didn’t know what to do with the light it found. It flinched from it. Started to bury itself where it had always lived- just beneath Agatha’s ribs, where no one could touch it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her eyes glance away from Rio, flicking past her, reaching for anything solid- any object, any dull fact to ground herself in. A bottle of shelf liquor. A cracked corner in the mirror behind the bar. Something safe.</p><p> </p><p>Something that wasn’t Rio Vidal and her roaring silence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t have it in me to be gracious twice.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped back to her. She didn’t mean to. It just happened like gravity, like instinct. Blue met brown, and the silence cracked. Agatha bit her tongue. Hard. Forced the sound down before it could betray her.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio asked, “Do you want me to stop?”</p><p> </p><p><em> Switzerland, </em> Agatha reminded herself for what felt like the hundredth time.</p><p> </p><p>This was still Switzerland. </p><p> </p><p>Even if it was on fucking fire underneath her feet.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, barely more than a breath. “I don’t think I do.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded and let out a shaky breath, her whole body vibrating like she was holding too much in too tight a space. The corner of her mouth twitched- almost a smile, but not enough strength behind it to carry it through. “That’s good,” Rio whispered. “That’s really good. You look good, Agatha.” As she said it, she shifted, drawing the side of her body that was still pressed to Agatha’s a half step back. Her eyes dropped, tracking the open line of Agatha’s blazer, the exposed skin beneath it.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha’s voice was steady, but everything in it betrayed her. It sounded like control, but it ached like desperation. And Rio- </p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t looking anywhere but Agatha’s mouth now.</p><p> </p><p>One second. Maybe two. That’s all the time they had left before it happened.</p><p> </p><p>“Please let me,” Rio begged.</p><p> </p><p>And that was it.</p><p> </p><p>That was the moment Agatha heard it- the beginning chords of the Bee Gees <em> More Than a Woman </em>bleeding through the bar speakers.</p><p> </p><p>Not even the original song.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> The fucking Glee cover. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Of all the songs in all the bars in the world, it had to be <em> this one, </em> dripping with sincerity and secondhand embarrassment.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her body physically reject it.</p><p> </p><p>Because no matter how much she wanted Rio’s mouth on hers -seventeen years of wondering, of pacing the edges of this exact moment- she was not going to kiss her in the middle of a packed bar with a disco heartbreak anthem screeched in a Ryan fucking Murphy musical number.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had limits.</p><p> </p><p>She had self respect.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha Harkness was going to ruin seventeen years of perfectly preserved nothing, she was going to do it right. Slowly. Selfishly. With enough detail to replay the memory like a good Catholic in the morning after, when guilt and fear inevitably showed up with a baseball bat and tried to convince her she hadn’t wanted it.</p><p> </p><p>So no. Not here.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ripped herself away from Rio in a single breath. A full body decision made in less than a second. No plan. No grace. Just the desperate instinct to escape.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>“I’m going outside,” Agatha muttered, already moving- no pause, no explanation. The words fell behind her like dropped coins, left in the faint, humiliating hope someone might bother to pick them up. </p><p> </p><p>Her body reeled from the loss like Agatha ripped it away from something that always belonged to her and now it was missing.</p><p> </p><p>The night air hit her face.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the slap of reality Agatha had hoped for. It didn’t cool her down. It didn’t fix a thing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept walking, rounding the corner of the building, pulse hammering harder with every step. She needed the night to swallow her. Agatha fucking needed the dark to do what she couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Her back found the brick wall, and she pressed against it like she could force herself to stay still. Like stillness would make her stop feeling it.</p><p> </p><p>It was stupid. Loud. Entirely in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha folded her arms across her chest before she could think better of it, pulling the edges of her blazer tight, like that thin layer of fabric might hide her. Might erase the fact that her skin had been seen, wanted, touched without being touched.</p><p> </p><p>The heat of Rio’s eyes was gone, but it still burned relentlessly on her skin.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha fucking hated that she missed it.</p><p> </p><p>She heard footsteps approaching familiar in a way that made her stomach tighten.</p><p> </p><p>They stopped a few feet away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha realized right then, that she wasn’t going to think about what it meant. Not why now, not whether she’d regret it in the morning. That was for later. All she wanted -all she <em> needed </em>- was to know what Rio tasted like after all this time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha arms fell from her chest. The gesture felt heavier than it should have, like a surrender. Rio’s eyes followed the motion, falling to the strip of skin Agatha no longer bothered to cover. For a moment, Rio didn’t look away. Then she looked right back up to Agatha’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>What comes after, Agatha figures, they could deal with later.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha gave a small nod. Whether it was meant for Rio or for herself, she didn’t know. Her own voice was soft, but steady. “Come here. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>She pushed herself off the wall as Rio was already moving toward her. The space between them vanished so quickly it barely felt real. Agatha reached for Rio, fingers cupping Rio’s cheek, needing to close the gap before her brain changed its mind.</p><p> </p><p>They collided hard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fell into Rio and Rio caught Agatha without stumbling back, like she’d been waiting to do that for years. Her hands found Agatha’s hips, then circled around her waist, pulling their bodies into each other. Their mouths found each other in a rush.  It was open from the start, breathless and messy and perfect.</p><p> </p><p>The sound that slipped out of Agatha’s mouth was soft but urgent, caught somewhere between a gasp and a groan. Rio answered with one of her own, soft and whined, and the vibration of it lit something deep in Agatha’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand slid up, curling behind her neck, thumb pressing into the curve just beneath her ear as she tilted Agatha closer, deeper. Her mouth was warm, familiar in the way only something long denied could feel. Agatha didn’t hold back. Her lips parted fully, tongue sweeping into Rio’s mouth, tasting her with years of hunger behind it. She tasted beer, breath, the edge of teeth, the softness of longing turned feral.</p><p> </p><p>It was everything Agatha imagined and worse. Because now she knew. Now she couldn’t unknow it. Couldn’t untaste Rio. Couldn’t unfeel the way Rio melted into Agatha like she’d been waiting her whole life to do exactly this.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tangled her fingers into Agatha’s hair, pulling just enough to guide her, just enough to show Agatha she wasn’t going anywhere. Her kiss was generous but demanding, gentle in a way sleep is to the freezing, impossible to resist, too quiet to fight. Rio let Agatha take, and then asked for more. Her mouth mapped the shape of Agatha’s want, teased apart every breath, every sound, every tremble.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha gave her everything- every sound her mouth could offer, every inch of closeness she had left to give.</p><p> </p><p>When they finally broke apart, it wasn’t graceful. Agatha’s breath hitched in her chest, caught between a moan and a laugh. Her head spun. Her legs barely remembered how to hold herself up. Rio leaned in again, forehead brushing gently against Agatha's. They stood there like that for a few moments.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio tilted her chin and kissed Agatha- just once, slower this time. A single press of her lips that might’ve passed for restraint if it hadn’t lingered too long, if it hadn’t said <em> more </em> instead of <em> enough </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand moved instinctively, palm resting flat against Rio’s chest, fingers curling against the heat of her skin, unwillingly twitching because they didn’t want to let go.</p><p> </p><p>“We should go back in,” Agatha said, breath shallow and uneven. Even to herself, Agatha sounded entirely unconvinced.</p><p> </p><p>And neither of them moved.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t speak.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha -still breathless, still held against Rio with her pulse going absolutely batshit crazy inside her own chest- came to one very clear, very horrifying conclusion: Agatha was absolutely, irreversibly, and possibly cosmically fucked. Not romantically. Not emotionally. Not even sexually, though that suddenly felt like a very short walk. No, this was deeper. Existential. Structural. The kind of fucked that rewrote your internal bylaws and then politely asked you to reread them with feeling.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever part of Agatha Harkness had spent seventeen years building a wall around this exact possibility had just watched Agatha obliterate it with her entire mouth open.</p><p> </p><p>The fantasy she’d managed to live in, for all of five minutes, had collapsed. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s personal Switzerland had lost its neutrality. </p><p> </p><p>It had declared a state of emergency and was actively requesting international aid.</p><p> </p><p>And all Agatha could do now was fight not to be buried underneath the rubble.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Agatha went home alone and tried not to let the kiss drown everything else. Tried not to let it bleed into places it didn’t belong.</p><p> </p><p>They were friends. The Road was Switzerland. And they kissed. That was all. That had to be all.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t let herself linger on what it meant. She couldn’t. It was too much. So she focused on the mechanics. The press of Rio’s mouth. The feeling of her hands in Agatha’s hair. The slow, certain drag of her tongue. </p><p> </p><p>Definitely not the part where seventeen years of wondering what it might feel like somehow failed to prepare Agatha for the reality of it. Not the part where it ruined every version she’d ever imagined. It left her breathless, undone, aching in a way fantasy never could. It left her starving.</p><p> </p><p>Alone in bed, she let her hand slip beneath her waistband. Came quietly, Rio’s name fell from her teeth. That was the deal Agatha made with herself: just this. Just tonight.</p><p> </p><p>By morning, Rio would be a story she didn’t tell. The kiss, a lapse in judgment. The jealousy, nothing to examine too closely- just a flicker, a glitch, a moment Rio had no right to claim and Agatha had no business wanting. She’d scrub it from her memory like it didn’t undo her. Like it hadn’t left Agatha wide awake, aching for something she was still pretending not to want.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha woke up, she didn’t dwell on it. She got up, made her bed, brushed her teeth like it hadn’t happened.</p><p> </p><p>She’d kissed Rio. Now she knew what it felt like. She didn’t need to do it again. It didn’t have to mean anything unless she let it, and she wasn’t going to.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t mean they weren’t still trying. Still figuring out how to be in each other’s lives again without making it complicated.</p><p> </p><p>They were adults. Capable of being friends. Friends who occasionally made bad decisions, sure, but friends all the same.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha wasn’t going to ruin that just because one of those decisions had left her aching for more.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Two hours later, her phone pinged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was mid sip, coffee still in her mouth, when she unlocked the screen.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio: hi </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard and set the mug down a little too forcefully on the counter.</p><p> </p><p>She typed back.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Hey. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The reply came almost instantly.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio: are we okay? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose and fired off a reply with the enthusiasm only panic could produce.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Obviously. We’re fine. We’re friends, remember? Everything’s great!!!  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the screen, watching the typing bubbles appear and disappear like Rio couldn’t quite commit. She chewed at her thumbnail, telling herself it wasn’t a big deal. The last thing she needed was for things to get awkward. She still wanted Rio in her life. As a friend, of course.</p><p> </p><p>They were trying. They were rebuilding. Two days in wasn’t enough time to screw everything up. Not even for Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could spiral any further, Rio finally responded.</p><p> </p><p>A single thumbs up emoji.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at the screen, expression flat.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck,” she said into the silence of her kitchen. “That’s it?” She slapped the phone face down on the counter.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t known what to expect, exactly, but it sure as hell wasn’t that. Was she allowed to be mad? Because she was. She absolutely was. Rio kissed her and then-</p><p> </p><p>Her phone pinged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha spun around and grabbed it without thinking. </p><p> </p><p>“Thank god,” she whispered, then caught herself. “I mean. Gross.”</p><p> </p><p>She unlocked the screen.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio: you want to get breakfast? i can pick you up.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Good. That’s what Agatha wanted.</p><p> </p><p>No drama. No conversation. No rehashing anything that might have happened outside a bar under a streetlight her brain can’t stop replaying.</p><p> </p><p>Just breakfast. Just friends.</p><p> </p><p>She typed:</p><p> </p><p><em> Sure </em>.</p><p> </p><p>And hit send.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s response came in immediately.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio: cool. send me your address and i’ll head over in 15 </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sent it, then bolted upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>She took the fastest shower she could manage. She threw on jeans and a navy long sleeve with a mock turtleneck. Clean. Neutral. Not trying too hard.</p><p> </p><p>She yanked a brush through her hair, checked the mirror, and told herself it was fine.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t matter what she looked like. It was breakfast. With a friend.</p><p> </p><p>Ten minutes later, Rio texted that she was outside.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabbed her purse, took a breath, and paused in front of the foyer mirror. She looked good. Calm. Like someone who wasn’t overthinking any of this.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped outside, locked the door behind her, and headed down the porch steps.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s black 4Runner was parked dead center in front of the sidewalk, neat as ever. The windows were tinted too dark to make out much, but Agatha could see the outline of a baseball cap tilted low. Rio’s head was down- probably on her phone. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha squared her shoulders and kept walking toward the car.</p><p> </p><p>She rounded the car and slid into the passenger seat.</p><p> </p><p>It was exactly what Agatha expected- spotless. It still smelled like a new car, all synthetic leather and obsessive care. A pack of cigarettes was tucked neatly beneath the center console display, and just beneath it, Agatha’s old purple Zippo.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it for a second before looking away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in jeans and another NYC Liberty t-shirt, layered over a black and white striped long sleeve. Her turquoise Liberty baseball cap was pulled snug onto her head. She set her phone down on top of the cigarette pack and turned toward Agatha, about to say something.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha beat her to it. She wasn’t giving Rio the lead here. She needed control.</p><p> </p><p>“Nice car,” Agatha said, casual, clipped.</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, shifted into drive, and pulled off smoothly. “Thanks. It’s an upgrade from that beat up Beemer I used to drive.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Please. You loved Tulip.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio side eyed her, quiet for half a second. “Yeah. I did,” Rio muttered. “That actually hurt me to say. I take it back. May she rest in peace.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit back a grin. “You wrote her a eulogy, didn’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t respond. Which was, frankly, answer enough.</p><p> </p><p>“She finally break down on you?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. “No. Some jackass rear ended me. Totaled her.” She said it flatly. “I was devastated.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her eyes on the road ahead, lips twitching. “That sucks. When was that?”</p><p> </p><p>“About a year ago.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, still biting back a grin. Rio was dead serious. Mourning the car like it was a person.</p><p> </p><p>And honestly? That tracked.</p><p> </p><p>They pulled up to the breakfast spot, and it wasn’t where Agatha thought they were going.</p><p> </p><p>She’d assumed Rio would take them to Sam’s- the old diner across the street from the hospital, the one they always used to go to.</p><p> </p><p>But this place was different. Not fancy, just unfamiliar. It hadn’t been here ten years ago when Agatha left, and it definitely wasn’t on Rio’s usual rotation.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was a creature of habit. Always had been. She had five or six places and rotated through them like clockwork, always reading the menu ahead of time, always ordering the same thing. She didn’t like surprises. She didn’t take risks.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at the building again.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> So what the fuck was this? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“You been here before?” Agatha asked, keeping her voice light as she unbuckled her seatbelt.</p><p> </p><p>“Nope,” Rio said, grabbing her phone and getting out of the car.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She stared at the now empty driver’s seat, momentarily stunned.</p><p> </p><p>No. She wasn’t thrown off. Not over this. Agatha was just… surprised. That was all.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio wasn’t supposed to do things like go to new places, make different choices, take risks in Jenga, or fucking kiss Agatha outside of a fucking bar.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was supposed to be the same. That was the point. That was the story Agatha had told herself for a decade.</p><p> </p><p>That way, Agatha never had to wonder what might’ve happened if Rio had been anything else.</p><p> </p><p>And now?</p><p> </p><p>Now Agatha wasn’t so sure.</p><p> </p><p>And that, whatever <em> that </em>was… felt dangerously close to betrayal.</p><p> </p><p>She shoved the door open and scrambled out, trying to make it look effortless. Rio was already at the back of the car, leaning casually against the trunk, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha adjusted her shirt, straightened her posture, and walked over like she hadn’t just spent the last thirty seconds rethinking the last ten years.</p><p> </p><p>Everything was fine. She was not thrown off.</p><p> </p><p>Not at all.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s go,” Agatha said, striding past Rio and heading straight for the restaurant entrance.</p><p> </p><p>Rio followed without a word.</p><p> </p><p>At the door, Agatha grabbed the handle, but Rio reached around her and held it open. Agatha walked through like she didn’t notice.</p><p> </p><p>She approached the host stand and said, “Two,” before the hostess could ask. The hostess nodded, grabbed two menus, and led them to a booth.</p><p> </p><p>They slid into their seats. Agatha set her purse down and reached for the menu, casting a glance at Rio. Not because she cared. She didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just needed to know if Rio had looked at it beforehand.</p><p> </p><p>Just out of curiosity.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe.</p><p> </p><p>Rio picked up the menu, but barely glanced at it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clocked it immediately. She already knew what she was getting.</p><p> </p><p>Of course she did.</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, that settled Agatha more than it should have. She looked back at her own menu, tension in her shoulders easing.</p><p> </p><p>The waitress came by and took their drink orders. When she returned with their drinks, she took their food orders without much small talk.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was unwrapping the straw for her Diet Coke when she asked, “How’s Lilia?”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia Callderu- Agatha was never quite sure whether to call the woman cooky or wispy. Possibly both. The jury had been out for years and showed no signs of returning with a verdict.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio was nine, her parents died in a car crash. No next of kin. No one waiting. She cycled through seven foster homes in under a year before landing with Lilia, who, against all odds, kept her. And, eventually, adopted her.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s good. Retired five years ago.” Rio said it lightly, her fingers skimming across the table.</p><p> </p><p>“Y’all still do Sunday dinners?”</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally escaped Massachusetts and the chokehold of her mother’s expectations, there was no family waiting on the other side. No home to return to. Holidays were just closed dining halls and couches borrowed from classmates who pitied her more than they liked her.</p><p> </p><p>Later, once she had her own apartment, she tried to convince herself it was better that way. No obligations. No travel. Just her and a pile of takeout containers, watching the world celebrate through double paned glass. It was fine. Manageable, even. Loneliness had rules, and she followed them.</p><p> </p><p>Then she met Jen. And, inevitably, Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had invited her to Sunday dinner once. Agatha had almost said no, out of habit. But she went. Lilia had asked about her family that night, not prying, just curious. Agatha had shrugged and said there wasn’t one. That was all it took.</p><p> </p><p>No one made a speech or carved her name into a chair, but after that, there was always a place set for Agatha. She started showing up on Sundays. Then holidays. Birthdays that weren’t hers. At some point, Agatha stopped flinching when coworkers asked where she was going for Thanksgiving. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha never called it home, but it was the closest thing she’d ever had to one. And it was enough. More than enough.</p><p> </p><p>And then she met Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>It happened gradually, the way most things do when you think you’ll get another chance. </p><p> </p><p>Just a few missed dinners. Conflicts, scheduling, the pull of a new life arranging itself around her. Wanda didn’t ask where she spent her Sundays, and Agatha didn’t offer. She told herself it was fine. That she’d go next week. Or the one after that.</p><p> </p><p>By then, Agatha belonged elsewhere. She was someone else’s wife, part of someone else’s plan. It was natural, she reasoned. What people did when they fell in love- rearranged their lives, let a few things go.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Sage and I work every Sunday, so we moved it to Tuesdays. But yeah, still happens.”</p><p> </p><p>Something in Agatha lurched to a sudden, terrifying halt. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Sage and I.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Since when did Sage factor into Lilia’s dinners?</p><p> </p><p>The realization hit Agatha in the gut- sharp, specific, and quietly fucking devastating. She had missed something. Something important. And worse than that, she wasn’t sure she had the right to ask for it back.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage?” Agatha asked, trying to sound neutral.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, yeah. One of Lilia’s foster fails.” Rio wasn’t looking at her when she said it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her Diet Coke.</p><p> </p><p>There it was. Something important. </p><p> </p><p>She coughed once, then again, harder, like she could force any words out of her mouth the same way the carbonation burned up her throat.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Foster fails. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>To Agatha’s knowledge, Lilia had fostered plenty of kids before Rio- but Rio was the only one she ever adopted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha remembered a dinner, years ago. Lilia at the counter, cutting potatoes:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “She’d been through seven homes that year. Nine years old, angry at the whole damn world- and who could blame her? I don’t know what made her different. But she was. Fought me every day like I was just another stop. But I’d already decided I wasn’t. I think she figured that out eventually.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Lilia had gone right back to cutting potatoes like she hadn’t just said something that lodged itself in Agatha’s chest. She’d never forgotten it. Probably never would.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat and forced herself to push past it.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought you were the only one,” Agatha said. “Lilia always said she was done after you.” She tried not to let it sound like an accusation, even if it felt like one.</p><p> </p><p>“She was,” Rio said with a shrug. “But in, like, 2014, I think? My old case agent called her. Said there was this girl who’d been in the system her whole life and needed somewhere stable. Enter Sage. The rest is kind of history.”</p><p> </p><p>And suddenly- everything made sense.</p><p> </p><p>The relationship between Rio and Sage had always been just short of explainable. Too familiar, too lived in, too goddamn synced for coworkers. And Agatha had still told herself it was just late shifts and trauma bonding.</p><p> </p><p>It was so goddamn obvious.</p><p> </p><p>The truth had tried to slap Agatha in the face a dozen times. The way they left work together. The way Rio was Sage’s ride at game night. The way Sage had practically launched herself across the table at the bar last night, and Rio had egged her on like she wanted the fight, like they’d done it a thousand times before.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t just act like sisters. They basically fucking were sisters.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had left, and she had genuinely believed, in an arrogant way, that things would freeze in place behind her. That Rio would stay Rio. That Lilia’s house would always be what it had been. That if she ever came back, nothing would have shifted too much without her.</p><p> </p><p>She felt sick. Because now, with Rio’s words still echoing in her head, the timeline caught up and it knocked the wind out of her.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> 2014. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened around her straw. She was still living in Westview in 2014. Married, yes. Distant, sure. But she was living five miles away, married and miserable, and somehow completely in the fucking dark.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her tongue to the inside of her cheek and felt her jaw tighten until it ached. Her eyes stayed on the table. She needed to breathe. Just once. Before she said something that would get her arrested. Before she lit Rio’s ass on fire for waiting thirteen years to say a single goddamn thing about this.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha looked up, Rio was already watching her with a guilty expression that made Agatha’s chest feel too tight.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” Agatha said, her mouth twisting. “That’s funny. I was here in 2014.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think you were busy,” Rio said quickly. “You know… with wedding stuff.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “I got married in 2013.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled, and her shoulders sank slightly. “We weren’t really talking. Things were weird. It wasn’t something I kept from you on purpose, it just… happened.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, jaw tight. “It just happened?” she asked. “The woman who raised you took in another kid while I was still here, and I was just... left out of the loop?”</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t meant to sound hurt, but she was. <em> Deeply. </em></p><p> </p><p>Not because Agatha thought she had a right to know- not officially, not in any logical way. But there had been a time when she would have. When news like that wouldn’t have found its way to her by accident, thirteen years late and tossed out in the middle of a conversation like it was barely worth mentioning.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha- look-”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re an asshole,” Agatha snapped. She exhaled through her nose, tried to swallow the heat behind her eyes. Tried to remember that this wasn’t about being owed anything.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha couldn’t say it. That Lilia had mattered to her, too. That house had once been the only place that felt like home. </p><p> </p><p>Rio fucking knew that.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her, eyes wide and stunned. It made her look younger than she was. Her mouth opened and closed, twice, before she finally spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re right. I’m so-</p><p> </p><p>“Who knew?” Agatha cut in, her voice hard. “Everyone? Jen? Alice? They both knew?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed hard. Her eyes dropped for a second, flicked away like she was looking for a place to hide. When she looked back at Agatha, she didn’t try to spin it.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded once.</p><p> </p><p>Of course they knew.</p><p> </p><p>Of course they all fucking knew.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t even be mad properly. Not at Rio. Not at Jen. Not even at herself. The worst part was knowing she’d done it too- drifted, avoided, chosen silence when it felt easier. And this was what silence gave you.</p><p> </p><p>A name. A face. A whole person wrapped into a life Agatha used to know and no one thought to fucking tell her.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha, please,” Rio said, barely above a whisper. “Just let me explain.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then fucking explain,” Agatha hissed, teeth clenched.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t think Sage was permanent. I really didn’t.” Rio started, fast. “I thought- maybe Lilia just wanted one last hoorah before calling it quits. I wasn’t living there anymore. The house was quiet. She was probably lonely.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her. She wanted to find something in Rio’s face that didn’t match what she was saying- some crack, some excuse to be angrier than she already was.</p><p> </p><p>Rio went on. “I didn’t even know Sage. She was kept to herself a lot. You and I weren’t really talking. It didn’t feel like something worth mentioning. And then weeks went by. Then months. And then you and I weren’t talking at all anymore. Then Lilia started saying stuff-.. And I… I realized she wasn’t leaving.”</p><p> </p><p>“By the time Lilia adopted her, you were already in Chicago. We hadn’t spoken in months. And it felt too late. Too weird.” Rio gave a breath of a laugh, humorless. “What was I supposed to do, Agatha? Reach out and say, ‘Hey, remember that foster kid I never mentioned? She’s still here. She’s basically family now. Thought you should know’?”</p><p> </p><p>Every word out of Rio’s mouth sounded reasonable. A perfectly logical, deeply human mistake.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha still wanted to scream.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head. “You knew what that place meant to me. What Lilia meant to me. You knew. You just didn’t want to deal with what it might’ve meant if I still cared.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio flinched at that, just barely, but Agatha saw it.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t mean to-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “You didn’t mean to,” she repeated. “That’s the problem with you. You never mean to do anything, and people still get hurt.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed hard. “You’re right,” she said. “You had every right to know. And I fucked up. I’m sorry, Agatha. I really am.”</p><p> </p><p>Well. Agatha got her apology. Rio actually took accountability for once, which was- miraculous, honestly. One small miracle in the timeline of their spectacularly dysfunctional history.</p><p> </p><p>She was still pissed. That wasn’t changing anytime soon. Agatha fully intended to hold onto the narrative that Rio was completely in the wrong and maybe also the actual devil. But for now? She was over this fucking conversation.</p><p> </p><p>“Noted,” was all Agatha said, then took a long sip from her straw and turned to stare out the window.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you still mad at me?” Rio asked, softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked over, and there it was. That face. Those goddamn eyes- big, brown, and full of guilt and whatever the hell softness Rio always used to pull out when she felt bad about something but didn’t know how to fix it.</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, Agatha felt like shit. Because seeing Rio sad always made her feel like shit. It was like being asked to walk barefoot across miles of legos and pretend it wasn’t painful as fuck. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “No.” </p><p> </p><p>She grabbed her drink, took a sip, looked back out the window.</p><p> </p><p>“But for the record,” Agatha muttered, “you’re still an asshole.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fair.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel Rio watching her.</p><p> </p><p>“Just act normal before I change my mind.”</p><p> </p><p>Their food came not long after, and the conversation shifted with it. They didn’t force it- they just moved on from the heavy stuff.</p><p> </p><p>They talked. About nothing, mostly. About the waitress’s attitude. About how Rio still couldn’t order anything without turning it into a ten step customization. Agatha made fun of her for it. Rio told her to shut up. Agatha smirked into her drink and took it as a win.</p><p> </p><p>It got easier as they went. Not perfect. But easier.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe it was going too well. So well that Agatha felt the familiar itch creep in that made her want to ruin it before it got comfortable. Before it could start feeling like safety again. Especially when she caught herself looking at Rio’s mouth, thinking how it looked better last night. Right after they’d kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stabbed her fork at her plate and asked, like it was no big deal, “You date anyone while I was in Chicago?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look thrown. She wiped her mouth, slid her plate out of the way, and smiled.</p><p> </p><p>“Not seriously,” Rio said with a shrug. “But a woman has needs.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grimaced inwardly. Of course Rio had flings. She always had flings. Casual. Disposable. Easy to laugh about the next morning.</p><p> </p><p>God, it was pathetic how that still managed to sting.</p><p> </p><p>“Classy,” Agatha muttered, trying to swallow the bite of food she suddenly wanted absolutely nothing to do with.</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, but didn’t take the bait. Just watched her for a beat, then leaned back and said, “Alright. My turn.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, eyes narrowing. “Your turn for what?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rested her arms on the table and folded her hands like they were settling in for a conversation she’d been waiting to have. “You asked me a question. Seems fair I get to ask one in return.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back, arms crossed. “Yeah? Better make it count.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio met her eyes and didn’t look away. “Why did you and Wanda get divorced?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned- loudly, unapologetically. “God.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a simple answer. Nothing ever was with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t been some big, dramatic moment that made Agatha realize she was done.</p><p> </p><p>It was a sweatshirt.</p><p> </p><p>Ugly. Faded. A thing Rio had tossed her once, without thinking, back when things were easier. It had lived in the back of the closet for years, buried between clothes Agatha never wore but couldn’t let go of. It was the only thing in that apartment that still felt like hers. Not because it was from Rio, but because it was untouched by Wanda.</p><p> </p><p>Sure, Agatha had never fully quit smoking. That was the one thing she held onto to keep some version of herself intact. But even that had been touched by the life she was in, folded into secrecy, kept out of sight. It wasn’t really untouched.</p><p> </p><p>But that sweatshirt was.</p><p> </p><p>Until one day, it wasn’t. </p><p> </p><p>It was just gone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had asked Wanda if she’d seen it. Wanda had smiled and said, <em> “Oh, that old thing? I donated it last week. You never wore it.” </em></p><p> </p><p>That was it. Just another edit made on Agatha’s behalf. And Agatha had smiled, nodded, said it was fine. Then went into the bathroom, shut the door, and sat on the floor until her hands stopped shaking.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda had taken so much from her. Not in obvious ways. Never all at once. It was always framed as care, as compromise. Change this. Adjust that. Make it easier, softer, more manageable. And Agatha did. She moved. She bent. She swallowed things whole.</p><p> </p><p>Then to top it off, Wanda had looked at the one thing Agatha had managed to keep for herself and saw nothing worth keeping.</p><p> </p><p>That’s what Agatha couldn’t forgive.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a revelation. It was a dull kind of disgust that settled under her skin and stayed there.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t leave right away. She made dinner. She went to work. She sent polite texts, cleared the dishwasher. She tried not to look at the empty space in the closet. The paperwork came a few weeks later, and she filled it out without thinking, as if it were just one more thing to be done.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Irreconcilable differences.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>It sounded reasonable. Like two people had simply drifted apart in a way that couldn’t be fixed. And maybe, in the most technical sense, that was true. But it didn’t come close to explaining the years she spent whittling herself down into something smaller just to make it work.</p><p> </p><p>There wasn’t a fight. There were forms. A few tense days. Logistics.</p><p> </p><p>Wanda kept asking what had changed. Agatha never answered. Because it wasn’t one moment. It was everything. Every compromise, every swallowed part of herself that was dismissed as love.</p><p> </p><p>The sweatshirt just made it too obvious to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Her fingers curled around her Diet Coke. She looked at Rio, cleared her throat and said, “I filed under irreconcilable differences. It sounded better than saying I couldn’t remember the last time I felt like a person in my own life.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “That’s it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. “Box was right there. Felt rude not to check it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a quiet laugh, shaking her head. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing. I just always figured if you two ever split, the reasons would include ‘chronic rudeness’ and ‘a deeply suspicious relationship with wine.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “Makes enough sense.”</p><p> </p><p>“Right?” Rio said, grinning. That gap in her teeth was showing, and Agatha’s heart flipped in a way she chose to ignore. “But I must say, I do have quite the soft spot for Agnes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and immediately threw a home fry at her. Rio dodged it without moving much at all, still grinning.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m just saying,” Rio said, unfazed, “She had a crush on me, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “She did not.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, she absolutely did,” Rio said. “Two and a half glasses in and I was suddenly being told I had the best hands on the East Coast.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed and grabbed another home fry to toss. “That never happened.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio caught it midair with one hand and looked far too pleased with herself. “It did, actually. And for the record, she matched with me on Bumble just a few days ago.”</p><p> </p><p>That stalled Agatha for half a second. She pressed her lips together like she was trying not to react, but the smile tugging at the corner of her mouth gave her away. Across the table, Rio just tilted her head and stared, tongue tucked into her cheek, wearing the exact kind of face that said, <em> go ahead, try and talk your way out of that one. </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose and gave a slight shake of her head. “Yeah, well. She has issues.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shot back, “She has taste.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. “She tried to climb into your lap in the middle of a Chili’s.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat up a little, eyes wide with conviction. “Oh, you mean only the greatest restaurant in the U.S. of A.? We were at Chili’s, Agatha. <em> Chili’s. </em> It was the closest I’ve ever come to a religious experience, and I wanted to marry her on the spot.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, genuinely at a loss. “Okay. Your obsession with Chili’s has always been fucking weird. ‘The greatest restaurant in the U.S. of A.?’ Do you understand how insane that sounds out loud?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked offended that Agatha had even asked such a question. “It’s not my fault this country peaked at the Triple Dipper and free, never ending chips and salsa.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, slowly. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Exactly.”</p><p> </p><p>The conviction alone should’ve been enough to roll her eyes and move on. Instead, Agatha found herself staring- irritated, mostly. And for reasons that didn’t hold up to any logic at all, she wanted to kiss Rio. Terribly.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could spiral, the waitress appeared beside them with a practiced smile and set the check on the edge of the table- completely oblivious to the fact that Agatha was exactly one second away from making a very poor decision because of Rio’s bizarre obsession with Chili’s.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabbed the check and pulled her wallet from the back pocket of her jeans. She was already moving like she’d planned to cover it the whole time, before Agatha could even think to offer.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t make it weird,” Rio said. “Even though, morally, I should absolutely make you pay for the Chili’s slander.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t fight her on it.</p><p> </p><p>She just watched Rio slide the card into the check sleeve, still clearly pouting over the alleged Chili’s slander.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> God, she’s so fucking annoying. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to kiss her so badly it made her jaw ache.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t perfect. The morning had been weird and tense and heavier than it should’ve been. But somehow, they’d made it through. Laughed. Talked like people who knew how to talk to each other.</p><p> </p><p>And that felt... good. Annoyingly good.</p><p> </p><p>So when Rio pulled up in front of Agatha’s house and shifted the car into park, Agatha felt that sinking feeling she used to get every time one of them left too early.</p><p> </p><p>They’d spent years knowing each other down to the breath, and for a few brief minutes, that had resurfaced. And now Agatha didn’t want to be left alone with it.</p><p> </p><p>“You can come in, if you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Because it’s easier than saying she didn’t hate the morning.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced over, one eyebrow barely raised. “Yeah?” she asked, quiet, like she was making sure Agatha wasn’t about to take it back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p> </p><p>So Rio nodded once. “Okay. Yeah. I want.”</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t need to make it a thing.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes, showing up was enough.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They stepped into Agatha’s house, and Rio started snooping immediately, eyes roaming, hands already picking things up like she was on a guided tour with no guide.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m going upstairs to change,” Agatha said, already unbuttoning her jeans. “I’d rather get hit by a car than lounge in denim.”</p><p> </p><p>She paused on the steps and glanced back. “Want a pair of shorts?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Rio called, distracted- already flipping through Agatha’s mail like she paid the bills.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even bother trying to stop her. “Knock yourself out. Let me know if you find anything interesting… Maybe a coupon.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio made a noise that might’ve been a laugh. Agatha just shook her head and headed upstairs, leaving Rio to commit fraud in peace.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled on a light blue tank top with thin straps and a pair of blue and white pinstriped boxers. She grabbed a pair of shorts from the dresser for Rio before heading downstairs.</p><p> </p><p>She found Rio standing in front of the television, idly scrolling through what looked like an endless lineup of streaming options.</p><p> </p><p>“Find anything interesting?” Agatha asked as she crossed the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Your mail’s depressing,” Rio said without looking back. When she finally did turn around, her eyes barely skimmed over Agatha before she reached for the shorts and handed over the remote. </p><p> </p><p>“I’d tell you where the bathroom is, but I’m guessing you already know!” Agatha shouted after her, watching as Rio headed confidently down the hall toward the half bath without needing directions.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s classic evil little cackles echoed back in response.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, already smiling.</p><p> </p><p>She sank into the corner of the couch -the L-shaped part she always claimed- and turned on a movie, pretending it was a random pick. It wasn’t. It was <em> The Proposal </em>. A rom-com she loved far more than she’d ever admit, and had seen enough times to mouth the lines word for word.</p><p> </p><p>Rio returned a few minutes later, now in the shorts but still wearing her layered long sleeve under her t-shirt. She’d taken off the baseball cap, letting her hair fall messily around her face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio came around the couch and glanced at the screen. “Love this movie,” she said, dropping into a spot two cushions down. She tucked her legs underneath her, body angled slightly toward Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>They weren’t paying much attention to the movie. It had barely started -maybe five minutes in- when Agatha asked if Rio wanted a beer. Rio said sure. Agatha got up, grabbed two from the fridge, and handed one over.</p><p> </p><p>They started talking. About nothing, really. Nothing that used to fill entire afternoons. At some point, the conversation swerved. Agatha wasn’t sure how they got there, but suddenly Rio was saying she’d never had her ears pierced.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at her. “What, ever?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged. “Nope.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, who had more holes in her ears than she could keep track of, narrowed her eyes. Sometimes she wore earrings in all of them, sometimes just one or two. It depended on the day. Or her mood. Or the level of petty defiance required.</p><p> </p><p>She sipped her beer. “You seem like someone who’s afraid of needles.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “I’m not.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Are you sure?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not!”</p><p> </p><p>And that was all it took. Agatha sat up a little straighter.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me pierce your ears, then.”</p><p> </p><p>She said it casually, like it was no big deal. She knew how. She’d done her own years ago, in a bathroom mirror with shaking hands and too much eyeliner. When your mother is Evanora Harkness, you learn quickly what will set her off. Piercing her own ears had been the fastest way to start a fire without lighting a match. The memory still made her smile.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. Of course she didn’t. She grinned, wide and a little chaotic, the same way she always had when she’d already decided on something.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her beer slightly. “Let’s pierce my ears, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>Naturally, Agatha had supplies. She kept things like that around in case she got bored or curious or restless. It wasn’t a surprise. What <em> was </em> surprising was how still Rio sat while Agatha cleaned her earlobes with isopropyl alcohol.</p><p> </p><p>She’d knelt in front of Rio to mark both ears evenly, gauging the angles with practiced eyes. But when she looked up to double check, she faltered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was staring at her. Not in amusement or challenge- but with this quiet, thoughtful sort of focus. Like she was trying to memorize her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze, just for a second. She coughed a small laugh and cleared her throat, willing the warmth rushing to her face to go unnoticed. Agatha pretended she didn’t know how obvious it was when she blushed.</p><p> </p><p>She made sure everything was right- no crooked holes or infections under her watch. She was a nurse, after all. Sterility wasn’t optional. Gloves on. Supplies prepped. Rio’s hair was pulled back in a high ponytail to keep it out of the way, and Agatha had already broken a bar of soap into chunks- just the right size to hold behind each ear for support.</p><p> </p><p>Rio held out her hand and flicked open Agatha’s old purple Zippo. Agatha sterilized the needle in the flame.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t move,” she said, steady. “I’m gonna stab you on the count of three.”</p><p> </p><p>“One. Two-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pierced Rio’s ear on two.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a scream -high pitched and dramatic, like she was being murdered- and jerked just slightly.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t flinch. She’d spent over a decade in the NICU, poking squirmy little creatures who cried and wailed and made everything ten times harder. She didn’t mind. She was used to it. She was good at this.</p><p> </p><p>And besides, Rio had asked for it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved with the small jolt of Rio’s body, steadying herself until she was sure Rio wouldn’t flinch again. Then she sat back on her heels and smiled- breath catching a little as she took in the stunned expression on Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>“See?” she said, smug and breathless. “That wasn’t so bad.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her, mouth hanging open, eyes wide in full betrayal. It was the most <em> are you fucking serious </em> look Agatha had ever seen.</p><p> </p><p>“You said on three!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely held back a laugh, biting her lip as she reached for the jewelry. “I felt you tense as soon as I said two. I didn’t have a choice.”</p><p> </p><p>“It hurt<em>, </em>” Rio snapped, voice climbing into a register that bordered on toddler level indignation. The only thing missing was throwing herself dramatically to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just hummed in fake sympathy as she swapped out the needle for the earring- a small black diamond.</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t have to do the other one,” Agatha gently added, sliding the back of the earring into place with careful fingers.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>“No- I want the other one done,” Rio shot back, just as upset that Agatha had dared suggest quitting in the middle of a mission.</p><p> </p><p>“You sure?”</p><p> </p><p>“Do it now. Actually-” Rio paused, narrowing her eyes. “On three.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held up her hands in mock surrender. “Okay. On three.”</p><p> </p><p>She prepped the second ear just as carefully as the first- soap, flame, steady fingers. Then she leaned in again, voice calm.</p><p> </p><p>“One. Two-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes squeezed shut.</p><p> </p><p>“Three.”</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, it was done.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha disposed of the needle first, carrying it to the kitchen where she kept a small sharps container tucked behind the sink. She dropped it in with a soft click, then peeled off her gloves.</p><p> </p><p>She crossed back into the living room and sank onto her knees between Rio’s legs. Her hands came to rest on the tops of Rio’s bare thighs, fingers brushing the soft skin there like they weren’t sure what they were allowed to touch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was trying not to pout. </p><p> </p><p>And God, Agatha had missed her. Missed her like it was a chronic ache. It settled in the way she would reach for someone in her dreams and wake up empty handed. In the way she would avoid certain songs. Certain memories she didn’t trust herself to touch without it stinging.</p><p> </p><p>Because it wasn’t just missing a person. It was missing <em> Rio </em>. The expressions she made when she was pretending not to pout, the way she turned toward Agatha even in silence, the reckless affection that always came a few seconds before Agatha could brace for it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have the words for what that did to her.</p><p> </p><p>And suddenly, she wasn’t braced at all. Rio had her arms around her, pulling her in, and Agatha let it happen.</p><p> </p><p>The hug was awkward -Rio perched on the couch, Agatha still kneeling on the floor- but somehow it didn’t feel that way. It just felt like them<em> . </em> A little off center, but holding anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let herself melt into it, her arms slipping under Rio’s shoulders, hands pressing gently against her back.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t say anything. Just leaned in  and tucked her face into the curve of Rio’s shoulder. It was warm, familiar, safe. Rio still smelled like fresh laundry. And when the smile crept up on Agatha’s face, uninvited and too big to hide, she pressed it into Rio’s shoulder, and let it disappear there.</p><p> </p><p>Like a secret. Just between them. </p><p> </p><p>“I really missed you, Agatha,” Rio mumbled into the side of her hair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. “Yeah,” she whispered. “Me too.” It was all she could manage.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back after a moment and gave her a small, crooked smile. Then she closed her eyes and tilted her head to show off both ears.</p><p> </p><p>“Well?” Rio asked. “Do I look cooler now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh. “You look fine. Go check the mirror if you need the ego boost.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned like that was exactly what she planned to do. She stood up, padded over to the foyer mirror, tilted her head this way and that, and hummed thoughtfully.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted on the floor, turning to rest her back against the couch.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, nodding at her reflection. “I definitely shouldn’t have let you do this. I’m gonna be even more of a babe magnet now. You might have to fight the ladies off me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’ll start training immediately.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked back and dropped onto the floor right next to Agatha, close enough their knees brushed. She picked up her beer, took a sip, and squinted at the TV. Agatha caught the way her eyes narrowed slightly. Then, without any warning, she turned to Agatha and asked, dead serious:</p><p> </p><p>“Do you mow your own lawn?” </p><p> </p><p>The question was so out of place, so deeply Rio, that Agatha couldn’t help but laugh. Loud and disbelieving, the sound burst out of her before she had a chance to rein it in.</p><p> </p><p>“Be serious,” Agatha said, shaking her head. “I’ve built my entire personality around never touching a lawn mower. I pay the neighbor’s kid.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grunted and turned back to the screen, unimpressed. “Fire him,” she muttered into her bottle before taking another sip. “And please clarify if he’s also the one responsible for turning your flower beds into a botanical crime scene.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped her head toward her, eyebrows raised. “You’re very invested in this for someone who doesn’t live here.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious. Fire him. He’s doing a terrible job. Tell him he’s seventeen and it’s not too late to pursue literally any other calling.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s thirteen,” Agatha corrected. “And I’m not exactly drowning in other options willing to do it for fifteen bucks and a Gatorade.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a long, almost theatrical sigh and rolled her eyes as if the answer had been obvious from the start. “I would,” she said. Her hand came to rest on Agatha’s thigh. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She didn’t even breathe for a second, just let the warmth of it sink in.</p><p> </p><p>“Free of charge,” Rio continued, still looking at the screen. “Out of pity. And to spare you from being the reason the neighborhood Facebook group starts posting pictures of your yard with captions like ‘Thoughts and prayers.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even try to hold back the snort that slipped out. Rio looked at her and grinned, wide and self satisfied, and it made Agatha’s heart do a somersault in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not that bad,” Agatha muttered, eyes drifting back to the screen, though her focus didn’t follow. Her fingers traced the length of Rio’s arm without much thought.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a lazy shrug and made a quiet, noncommittal sound. “It’s not hopeless,” she said, voice low. “Just embarrassing.”</p><p> </p><p>She turned her palm upward in Agatha’s lap, a small but unmistakable gesture that told Agatha not to stop. So Agatha didn’t. Her fingers kept moving, tracing gently along the inside of Rio’s forearm.</p><p> </p><p>They sat in the quiet for a little while, both of them watching the screen without really seeing it. Agatha’s fingers kept brushing slowly back and forth along Rio’s arm. No teasing. No commentary. Just the hum of closeness that neither of them seemed in a rush to break.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio sat up a little straighter, shifting her body toward Agatha. One elbow came up to rest on the couch as she leaned her head into her hand, completely at ease. Agatha’s hand, the one that had been stroking along Rio’s arm, fell to her thigh instead, unsure of where else to go now that it wasn’t following the line of Rio’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio brought her other hand up and poked lightly at Agatha’s chest. “Lucky for you,” Rio said, a smile tugging at the corner of her mouth, “you know someone with a criminally underappreciated green thumb and excellent taste, who just so happens to be sitting right here.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio and her fucking green thumb.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s apartment had always been full of plants. They were never loud. Never wild. One in a corner, another near the light. Something green and reaching on the balcony. Her space had always looked alive, in the most deliberate way. </p><p> </p><p>And somehow, her plants had ended up in Agatha’s space too.</p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t been a conversation. It wasn’t a gift. It was a slow collection. A potted plant on the kitchen counter. A plant in a hanging basket hooked on Agatha’s balcony one afternoon and never taken back. Agatha hadn’t asked for them. Rio hadn’t asked to leave them. But there they were.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha let them stay. She watered them. Moved them around when they got too much sun. Pretended it wasn’t a thing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio even used to hang eucalyptus in her shower. Which meant, eventually, Agatha did it too. At first it was because it smelled nice. Then because she got used to it. Even in Chicago, she’d kept it going. Currently, Agatha had some hanging in her bathroom upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>It was just a habit Agatha hadn’t gotten around to breaking. A habit her body remembered, even when her pride didn’t want to.</p><p> </p><p>And now Rio was propped up on one elbow, looking at Agatha- smirking, poking a finger to Agatha’s chest like she knew what beat there, and had no idea it had always been hers. That somehow, she’d taken up residence there without ever realizing it.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio always had a way of doing that.</p><p> </p><p>She planted, let things grow. Left parts of herself behind the way she used to leave behind plants: A pot on the counter. A hanging basket on the balcony. </p><p> </p><p>Harmless, until they weren’t. Until one day you looked around and realized they’d taken over the place. Thriving. Blooming. Tangling themselves into corners Agatha had never meant to share.</p><p> </p><p>“You offering to mow my lawn for free?” Agatha whispered, after tracing every piece of Rio that had outlived her absence.</p><p> </p><p>It was the only thing she could come up with that didn’t involve her heart falling out of her mouth and straight into Rio’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved the hand still resting against Agatha’s chest, lifted it, and gently tucked a piece of hair behind Agatha’s ear. </p><p> </p><p>“I can do more than that,” Rio muttered, barely above a whisper. “Clear out the flowerbeds. Pull up the old roots. Put down new ones. Something bright. Azaleas, maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>As Rio spoke, her hand slipped from Agatha’s cheek and settled gently over her chest again. She let it rest there for a moment, closed loosely into a fist.</p><p> </p><p>Then, again with a single finger, she tapped twice against Agatha’s heart. Like she was answering for all the times she hadn’t known what she was touching.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Oh. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> So that’s what it was like- </em>an offer wrapped in a metaphor, quiet enough not to spook Agatha. A small touch, planted with intention. A gesture that left no room for misreading.</p><p> </p><p>She had spent so long waiting to hear it- then longer convincing herself she never would. And now that it had been offered, gently and without condition, she didn’t know how to trust it. It didn’t feel like a lie. That was the worst part. It felt real.</p><p> </p><p>But seventeen years had taught Agatha how to speak around what she meant. How to make herself small enough to survive disappointment. How to twist her truth into something more manageable, easier to walk away from.</p><p> </p><p>“The soil’s been neglected, you know,” Agatha murmured, almost to herself. “Things don’t root easy after that. And it’s hard to tell, sometimes. What’s dead and what’s just taking its time… And sometimes it…  sometimes it grows strange. Reaches in the wrong directions. Starts needing things it doesn’t know how to ask for.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused. It should’ve ended there. It would’ve, if she were braver.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away and added, “Probably not worth the effort if it doesn’t know what to do with the sunlight.” She reached for a loose thread on her rug, tugging at it gently.</p><p> </p><p>It was second nature to twist instinct into dismissal, building exits into every sentence just in case Agatha needed to run. The words had left her too easily, like her mouth still hadn’t gotten the memo that she didn’t want to be misunderstood anymore.</p><p> </p><p>That was the problem.</p><p> </p><p>Because what Agatha had meant, if she were the kind of person who said what she meant, was simple.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Don’t hold me at face value when I say stupid shit. Especially when it sounds like I’m pushing you away. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>But what Agatha had said instead, was that it wasn’t worth the effort.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had always been good at showing up, at presence, at staying close. But she’d never been good at hearing what Agatha couldn’t say directly. Their language always ended up lost in translation. </p><p> </p><p>And now Agatha had to wait and see if Rio heard her anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed lightly once across Agatha’s sternum. </p><p> </p><p>“That’s okay,” Rio said quietly. “I’ll try again tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>The words rang familiar in Agatha’s ears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t known what to do with them before. She hadn’t let herself believe they meant anything more than what they said. Hadn’t let herself linger. It was easier to chalk it up to Rio being her usual brand of ridiculous- dramatic flirting, cryptic phrasing, her emotional sleight of hand. Easier for Agatha to roll her eyes than consider the possibility that any of it was sincere.</p><p> </p><p>This time, though, Agatha heard it differently. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had never just meant tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p>She meant as long as it took.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tore her gaze from the thread and looked at Rio, startled by finally being heard and by the way honesty had replaced the face of fear.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat felt too tight, her chest too full, but the word still found its way out.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>It was the only word she could come up with that gave Rio permission to keep showing up. And Agatha needed her to keep showing up- even when Agatha said the wrong thing. Especially then. Because Agatha wouldn't mean it. She never had.</p><p> </p><p>And somehow, Rio had heard that. Heard it beneath the noise, beneath the old habits Agatha hadn’t quite yet figured out how to kill.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded a little. “Okay,” she whispered back.</p><p> </p><p>And that was it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted, settled back against the couch the way they had before, eyes on the screen, saying nothing else. Agatha turned back too.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard and blinked a few times, willing the lump in her throat to disappear before it embarrassed her. Seventeen years of tension, of space, of assumptions. Of telling herself Rio wouldn’t change because she never had. That no one could be that stubborn and still become someone new.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio had. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha was still learning how to move again. Still tangled in what those seventeen years had done to her. Still trying to figure out what kind of version of herself could exist now, after some of the dust had settled.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio was patient. Not hovering. Not pushing. Just there. And she would wait. For as long as Agatha needed her to.</p><p> </p><p>And for now, that was enough.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Agatha woke up to her alarm at noon, groaning as she smacked her phone off the nightstand and blinked up at the ceiling. First shift of three. That meant she had just enough time to get her life in order before surrendering it to the hospital for the next few nights.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>She had about four hours to shower, grocery shop, and maybe meal prep for the weekend if she was feeling ambitious. With any luck, Agatha could finish early and squeeze in a solid hour or two of unproductive couch rotting before having to pull herself together for work.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha swung her legs over the side of the bed and sat there for a moment. Waking up always felt like a negotiation. Her body usually cooperated. Her brain, however, always took a bit more convincing.</p><p> </p><p>With one long, obnoxious groan, Agatha leaned over, grabbed her phone from where it had slipped off the nightstand, and trudged downstairs.</p><p> </p><p>On her way to the kitchen, Agatha passed the guest bathroom, when a sliver of light spilling into the hallway made her pause. The light was left on from the night before.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>She reached in, hand automatically going for the light switch, but stopped short when she saw a sticky note that was stuck perfectly to the edge of the mirror- purple, small, and unmistakably Rio’s handwriting.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha’s stomach did a stupid, flip thing.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>She stepped fully into the bathroom and peeled the note from the mirror, careful not to wrinkle it.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p> </p><p align="left"><em> Sunlight’s overrated. I’ll plant shade lovers. </em><em>They still bloom… </em> <em> And are very much worth the effort 🖤</em></p><p align="left">
  <em>                                                   -  R </em>
</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the sticky note.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>“Jesus Christ.” She mumbled, reading it again for the third time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha read it again. Then once more, just to be sure it still made her stomach twist in that way she hated.</p><p> </p><p>Great. Now she was smiling.</p><p> </p><p>Only a little. Just enough to be annoyed at herself.</p><p>Agatha slid the sticky note carefully into the pocket of her sweatpants. Then she turned off the bathroom light and headed to the kitchen.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped a pod into the Keurig and hit the button. While it churned to life, she pulled out her phone. She typed slowly, letting her thumb hover for a second before finishing the sentence.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> How are your ears feeling? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hit send and locked her phone.</p><p> </p><p>The Keurig finished with a final sputter and she drank it standing by the counter, not bothering to sit or pretend she had more time than she did. She had work tonight. A grocery run to fit in before that.</p><p> </p><p>Once the cup was empty, Agatha set it in the sink and headed upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere in between tugging off her sweatshirt and reaching for a towel, she pulled the sticky note from her pocket and, without thinking much about it, stuck it to the bathroom mirror. The glass was already starting to fog. She pressed the paper flat with the heel of her hand, just enough to make sure it stayed.</p><p> </p><p>By the time she stepped back, her reflection was already starting to blur, and the note had become the clearest thing in the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t think about it.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha got all her shit done and collapsed into her sacred rot time on the couch- blanket slipping off her legs, some Bravo monstrosity droning in the background, and no plans to move unless her house caught on fire.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzed twice against her thigh.</p><p> </p><p>Two notifications. Both from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>The first was a photo- taken from a ridiculous angle, Rio’s arm stretched high. She was still in bed, hair twisted into a slept-on ponytail, one eye shut, head tilted just enough to show off one of her new piercings. She wore a faded black t-shirt with Audrey II from <em> Little Shop of Horrors </em> grinning across the front.</p><p> </p><p>Of course. The carnivorous plant thing. Agatha had no idea when the obsession started, but she’d learned not to ask questions about Rio’s taste for morally ambiguous flora.</p><p> </p><p>Beneath the photo:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio: a little tender. makes me look hot af. 10/10 would let you stab me again. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha: Careful. I’ll take you up on that. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio: on second thought… i think i’m good :)  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Rio: save your energy. once these piercings debut i’m expecting at least three brawls and one marriage proposal by midnight. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha: Better make sure the ER is prepped. I’ve got excellent aim🔪🔪🩸🩸 </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio: so hot </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was still deciding whether or not to respond to Rio’s text when the most cursed name in her contacts covered her screen.</p><p> </p><p>
  <b>Wanda M.</b>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha loudly groaned into the air and rolled onto to her stomach, limbs sprawled across the couch, irritated that Wanda still had access to her number and that she’d interrupted what had been, up until now, a very decent evening before work.</p><p> </p><p>She let it ring. She hadn’t spoken to Wanda in months. She’d ignored the last round of erratic texts and saw no reason to reward this latest intrusion with an answer. </p><p> </p><p>Still, Agatha wasn’t sure how close she was to actually blocking her. The impulse came very often, followed by the stupid moral calculus of whether thirteen years entitled Wanda to one final conversation. Something along the lines of:<em> Free me from whatever this fucking post divorce purgatory is before I scorch what little civility we have left. </em></p><p> </p><p>The second call came a minute later. Same name. Same number. Same rising pressure at the back of her skull. Agatha let it ring again while she shoved her face into a pillow and yelled until the sound scraped her throat.</p><p> </p><p>When it stopped, she didn’t move. She waited, breathing through her teeth, hoping that was the end of it.</p><p> </p><p>It buzzed again. Then again. Two short, separate jolts. Not a call. Two texts.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha decided to check, not because she thought Wanda had suddenly learned impulse control, but because there was a chance it wasn’t her. A small, stupid, wishful chance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew better. But she checked anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Much to her disappointment, it was exactly who she thought it was.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The second the pictures loaded, Agatha knew they were from Jen’s Facebook. 70s Night at The Witches’ Road. Wanda hadn’t even bothered to crop them.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Sloppy. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The first photo was a group shot. Everyone else was smiling for the camera, drinks held up, arms slung around shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>Everyone except for two people.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Uh oh. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was leaned in, clearly whispering something into Rio’s ear. Her brown eyes were on the table, but her mouth had started to curl like she was about to laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the picture.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Yeah. Well. That might be a little damning. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The second picture was objectively worse.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was smirking straight into the camera. Both hands were resting lightly on Rio’s shoulders. Her cape, sheer and glittering, was lifted and blocking most of their upper bodies.  Rio had her hood up, and through the shimmer of fabric, her arms were crossed tightly, as if she didn’t trust her hands and needed them tucked away to behave. She wasn’t looking at the camera.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was looking at her.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t neutral. It wasn’t friendly. It was that stupid, tiny smile- barely there, lips just beginning to curve, eyes soft lidded and steady. The expression on Rio’s face felt impossibly intimate, especially in a photo that wasn’t supposed to look like anything at all.</p><p> </p><p>That smile didn’t belong in pictures. It was private. Something Agatha had only ever seen when they were alone, never offered to anyone else, never meant to be witnessed from the outside.</p><p> </p><p>And she had always known it was hers. Not wished. Not hoped. Known.</p><p> </p><p>To see it captured like this, visible, exposed, sent back to Agatha without context or warning, felt indecent- less like a memory and more like a secret someone else had gotten their hands on.</p><p> </p><p>It was right after they’d come back inside from eating each other’s faces off.</p><p> </p><p>Jen had drunkenly screamed at them for a photo while they were still riding the high of breaking a seventeen year losing streak. Rio pulled her hood up, maybe to hide her face, maybe just to retreat a little. Judging by the look she was caught wearing, it hadn’t fucking helped.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had left not long after. She didn’t trust herself to stay. Not with Rio looking at her like that. Not with the taste of her still everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>And now, staring at the photo, she could still see it. The flush in Rio’s lips, the slight swelling, the unmistakable aftermath of something that didn’t belong to anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>Her phone buzzed in her hands, and she flinched, only then realizing she had been zoomed in on Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>And for one deeply humiliating second, Agatha actually thanked her ex-wife for interrupting what had clearly been a very normal, very casual moment of hyper focusing on her best friend’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>Then she read Wanda’s text.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda M.: Didn’t realize you were still feeding strays… </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a furious, disbelieving, “Oooooh,” as her thumbs flew across the screen, hammering out a response with enough force to threaten the lifespan of her purple iPhone’s screen protector.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha: Projection’s a hell of a thing, Wanda.  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Agatha: There’s only one stray clawing at my door these days, and she doesn’t know when to fucking quit. </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Agatha: I’ll spare you the suspense. It’s you!  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Agatha: xoxo  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Agatha: … bitch! </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha immediately texted Jen: <em> Block her. </em> Then she opened her dusty, barely used Facebook and blocked Wanda. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slapped her phone face down on the coffee table and stormed off to get ready for work, muttering the whole way about how her rot time had been ruined. </p><p> </p><p>Which, to be fair, she hadn’t had much rot time left. Twelve minutes, give or take- but now the vibes were contaminated, and there was no salvaging them. The air felt different. Her couch felt different. Everything was tainted, and she blamed Wanda completely.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was charting. Jen, who had claimed one of the parent recliners behind her, had a juice box she’d stolen from the nutrition room and was sipping it obnoxiously loud while watching Agatha with the blank eyed intensity of a cat about to knock something off a shelf.</p><p> </p><p>“Your posture is terrible,” Jen said between slurps. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Just kept typing, jaw tight, chart half finished and mind ten miles elsewhere.</p><p> </p><p>It was creeping up on 4am, x-ray had already come and gone, and to Agatha’s inexplicable disappointment, it had been Teen assigned to the NICU that night.</p><p> </p><p>“So you were talking about Wanda, right?” Jen asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha paused mid charting, turned halfway in her seat. “What?”</p><p> </p><p>“That text you sent me earlier. All it said was ‘block her.’ I assumed you meant Wanda?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared. Blinked. Then delivered the flattest, driest look she could possibly summon. </p><p> </p><p>“Obviously.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen raised a brow. “I don’t know. You could’ve been talking about Ri-”</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>There wasn’t even a beat between the suggestion and Agatha shutting it down.</p><p> </p><p>Jen sat up a little straighter. “Did something happen between you two?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sputtered. Actually sputtered. “Wh-” She coughed once, tried to mask it as a casual laugh, and failed so fucking miserably. “No. Why-” Another shaky little noise that came out deeply guilty sounding. “Why would you even ask that?”</p><p> </p><p>And then Agatha’s voice flattened, “Did she say something to you?”</p><p> </p><p>Jen narrowed her eyes. “Okay. Yeah. You’re going to give me every single detail.”</p><p> </p><p>“There are no details.”</p><p> </p><p>“Liar.”</p><p> </p><p>“I pierced her ears.”</p><p> </p><p>“And?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Liar.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not-”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes you are.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m really not-”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply through her nose and hissed out, between clenched jaw, “Fine. We fucking kissed.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen sat up like someone had dumped ice water down her shirt. “Oh my god.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her.</p><p> </p><p>Jen said it again, louder, “Oh my god, Agatha. That’s great!”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, great. That tone. Like it was cute. Like it hadn’t detonated seventeen years of carefully compartmentalized bullshit in one stupid kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Jen immediately backtracked. “That is great... isn’t it? Wait. Did it suck?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“What?”</p><p> </p><p>“It did not suck,” she said through clenched teeth. “Quite the fucking opposite.”</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s jaw dropped slightly.</p><p> </p><p>“And that’s the fucking problem, Jennifer.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could’ve said a hundred things- biting, sarcastic, safe. But none of them felt right. Or true. So she gave the smallest shrug she could manage without looking like she cared.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>“You still in denial?”</p><p> </p><p>And what a fucking loaded question- and not for the first time.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha couldn’t afford to say it out loud. It was too new. Too uncertain. Saying anything now might turn it into something it wasn’t ready to be. Something Agatha wasn't ready for it to be. </p><p> </p><p>“I’m in denial about a lot of things,” Agatha said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>It was the closest thing to the truth she could give… again. </p><p> </p><p>Jen didn’t say anything right away. Agatha could hear the faint rustle of her shifting in the recliner, the subtle squeak of vinyl as she sat up a little straighter.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha… you’ve been in lo-“</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swiveled her chair back around and tried to focus on the chart in front of her. “Don’t get sappy on me now, Jen.”</p><p> </p><p>And Jen, to her credit, didn’t say anything else. Just took another long, obnoxious sip of juice and let Agatha pretend her hands weren’t shaking.</p><p> </p><p>Some things weren’t ready for daylight. Not yet.</p><p> </p><p>But that didn’t mean they wouldn’t grow.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio met her outside the NICU Saturday morning after shift change with a bottle of Diet Coke in hand. Agatha’s shift had been shit- her ex-wife had set the tone for it early, and it never really recovered. And the absence of Rio, even if it wasn’t supposed to matter, had only made it worse. But there she was. Asking how the night went. Offering to scold whichever baby had been causing Agatha trouble. Agatha laughed. She didn’t say what really made the shift unbearable. Didn’t say she’d wanted to see her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked her all the way to her car. Told her she’d see her in twelve hours. Agatha groaned and told her not to remind her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went home. Slept. Came back.</p><p> </p><p>That night, she texted Rio -<em> Break in 20 </em>- and didn’t really think about what she expected. Rio was already waiting outside when she got there. They shared a cigarette and talked about a trauma case- motorcycle, crushed leg, Rio describing the way the bones moved when she lifted it. Agatha nearly gagged. Rio looked smug about it. </p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Rio walked her to her car again.</p><p> </p><p>On Sunday, she came up to x-ray the babies. Caught Agatha’s eye more than once, and didn’t bother pretending not to. At some point, when things slowed down in the department, Rio came back -not with a machine, just herself- and dropped into one of the parent recliners at Agatha’s bedspace. Said they weren’t busy, and she had time. Agatha didn’t mind. She charted, she worked, she answered when Rio said something. It wasn’t a big deal. But it was… nice. Welcomed, even.</p><p> </p><p>Every time Agatha caught a glimpse of Rio’s freshly pierced ears, something in her chest pulled tight. Not because of the piercings themselves, but because she’d done them. Her hands. Her choice. Hers. It had been hers. Brief, and maybe a accident, but hers all the same. And now it was walking around the hospital like proof. Proof she’d let something happen. Proof she’d wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>It was stupid. And fleeting. And completely impossible to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t let herself think about it too hard. She just wanted to be around Rio without turning it into anything.</p><p> </p><p>None of it was a big deal.</p><p> </p><p>Not really.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha’s alarm went off at noon on Monday. She groaned and thrashed in bed, caught somewhere between exhaustion and rage. Her body ached from the weekend -three brutal night shifts back to back- and the nap she'd taken after getting home hadn’t come close to fixing it.</p><p> </p><p>She trudged downstairs, whining with every step. She made her coffee in silence, barely awake enough to press the right buttons.</p><p> </p><p>Then she collapsed onto the couch, remote already in hand, and turned on a Real Housewives franchise at random. She didn’t bother checking which one. She let it play, loud enough to keep her from dozing off again. She knew if she slept any longer, she’d wake up feeling worse.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s phone started ringing, and the sound of it was fucking unbearable. She felt it in her skull, in her teeth, behind her eyes- like it was drilling straight into her nervous system. She groaned and leaned forward, reaching for it where it buzzed across the coffee table.</p><p> </p><p>“Please don’t be my ex-wife. Please don’t be my ex-wife. Please don’t be my ex-wife,” she muttered, dragging herself upright.</p><p> </p><p>She flipped the phone over and to her surprise, it wasn’t Wanda. It was an incoming FaceTime call from Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha answered and was immediately greeted by the top half of Rio’s face, her forehead far too close to the camera.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>“What,” Agatha said, not bothering to sound polite.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you wanna hang out with me today?” Rio asked, voice slow and syrupy with sleep. At the end of the sentence, she lifted her chin just enough to flash a tight, toothy smile before sinking back down, hiding everything below her eyes again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Depends. What were you thinking?”</p><p> </p><p>“They just opened the pool at my apartment,” Rio said. “I want to rot in the sun while no one’s out there.” She blinked at the camera, then away. “Would you like to join me, goose?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squinted. “Goose?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a tired hum. “Yeah. ‘Cause you’re grumpy.” She rubbed at her face like it would help her stay conscious. “Grumpy goose.” As if it was obvious.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grimaced.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, whenever she was sleep deprived, had the unfortunate habit of being impossibly… endearing. She always used to get quiet and mumbly and strangely sweet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, fully accepted her role as the most irritable bird in the flock.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed. “What time?”</p><p> </p><p>Not because she couldn’t be alone. She loved being alone. Thrived in it. She was simply… outsourcing her rot today. That was allowed.</p><p> </p><p>“Whenever,” Rio murmured.</p><p> </p><p>“How far are you from me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Thirteen minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Send me the address. I’ll be there in twenty five.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yay,” Rio said, without an ounce of enthusiasm, and Agatha understood perfectly.</p><p> </p><p>They were both too tired to fake it. That was the whole point. Post night shift, nothing felt real anyway. Words came out slower. Time got weird. Agatha didn’t need conversation or plans or anything that resembled effort. Just someone else who knew what it meant to still hear monitor beeps in your head hours after clocking out. Someone who wouldn’t flinch if she went completely still and stared at the sky like it held answers. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha could pretend that wasn’t what she needed. She’d done worse.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dug her swimsuit out from the back of her closet, buried beneath a stack of clothes she hadn’t touched since she moved back. A purple bikini. She held it up, gave it a quick once over, then stripped down and pulled it on.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at herself in her bathroom mirror.</p><p> </p><p>Yeah. She looked fucking hot.</p><p> </p><p>Not in the wishful way. Not in the maybe if she tilts her head and squints way. It was fact. Her skin was soft and flushed from the shower. She looked alive. Solid. And just vain enough to know she didn’t need anyone else to confirm it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha applied her sunscreen alone in the bathroom, careful to get her shoulders and back. She absolutely could have asked Rio to do it for her. She absolutely wanted to. But she wasn’t going to hand herself over that easily. Not today.</p><p> </p><p>They were friends.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes flicked to the sticky note still stuck to the corner of her mirror. Agatha closed them for a second and repeated it to herself like a mantra.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed the lie to stay true a little longer. Just until she figured out what the hell she was doing.</p><p> </p><p>She packed fast. Towel, sunscreen, change of clothes, hair tie, water bottle. Threw it all in a canvas tote. Then she pulled on an old oversized t-shirt, slid on her sandals, and headed out.</p><p> </p><p>The drive to Rio’s was short. But the second she pulled up to the building, she clocked the difference. This place was far nicer than the last one Rio lived in. Gated, clean, almost too polished. She pulled up to the callbox, punched in the four digit code, hit the star key. The gate buzzed and swung open.</p><p> </p><p>Inside, she found Rio’s building, parked in the guest lot, and shot off a quick <em>H</em> <em> urry up </em> text to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio appeared a few minutes later, and Agatha stepped out of the car to meet her, bag over her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>She looked exactly how Agatha expected her to- oversized t-shirt, sunglasses halfway down her nose, flip flops barely making a sound. A towel was draped over one arm, a small cooler slung across her shoulder with a faded rainbow strap, and a travel cup in her free hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked good.</p><p> </p><p>Annoyingly good.</p><p> </p><p>Not that it mattered. Agatha barely noticed. Didn’t care. She barely even fucking looked.</p><p> </p><p>And if Agatha’s fingers twitched with the urge to fix her sunglasses, that was no one’s business but hers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted a greeting. </p><p> </p><p>Rio, without saying anything, handed over the cup.</p><p> </p><p>“What is it?” Agatha asked, taking it without hesitation, falling into step beside her.</p><p> </p><p>“Espresso. Promise it’s stronger than whatever you make with that Keurig.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a sip. She paused.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit. That’s good.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “It should be. That machine is the most expensive thing in my kitchen.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond.</p><p> </p><p>The walk to the pool was quiet. Neither of them had the energy to fake being awake. Their steps dragged. Their brains were still loading.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt just the edge of Rio’s hand brushing against hers. She glanced sideways. Rio was biting the inside of her lip, eyes ahead, brows drawn like she was deep in thought or trying not to be. Agatha told herself it was accidental.</p><p> </p><p>Then it happened again. Slower this time. More intentional.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head the other way, pretending to look at nothing, and let her finger skim the back of Rio’s hand. </p><p> </p><p>It didn’t count if she didn’t look.</p><p> </p><p>By the time either of them might’ve said or done something, they were already at the gate.</p><p> </p><p>The pool was nicer than Agatha expected. Sleek, bright, unnervingly pristine. A wide, shallow step spanned the far end, deep enough to let water glide over the tiles and lap at the bases of loungers that were built in. Beyond that, the pool slipped into a deeper blue. Still. Clear. Not a single ripple. No movement, no voices, no sound except for the distant hum of the heat and the faint scuff of their footsteps.</p><p> </p><p>It was completely empty.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Thank fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha claimed a table under an umbrella and dropped her bag onto it. Rio did the same- but in one blink, her t-shirt and flip flops were gone, peeled off and discarded in one smooth motion, and she was already walking toward the loungers, bare shoulders catching the sun, tan skin golden and glowing and absolutely not giving Agatha a second to prepare.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed under her breath. Rude. Honestly rude. She didn’t even get the satisfaction of watching her undress- didn’t get a single gratuitous second to linger, to drag her eyes up inch by slow inch of newly exposed- </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her gaze drop anyway, and all that annoyance vanished.</p><p> </p><p>The black bikini Rio wore was almost laughably minimal- nothing but thin straps up top and, below, a thong bottom that did absolutely nothing to protect Agatha’s sanity. The fabric curved high on Rio’s hips and disappeared entirely in the back, leaving the full view of her ass on unapologetic display. There was no room for modesty. No room for Agatha to look without consequences.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s tongue pressed into the inside of her cheek. Her eyes stayed locked on Rio’s ass, helpless. Her hands twitched at her sides. Desperate to follow.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t move, but the pull was visceral, dragging her forward in spirit if not in flesh- like a lamb to slaughter, holy and doomed, too far gone to pretend she wouldn’t kneel.</p><p> </p><p>A tiny, unbidden whimper clawed its way out of Agatha’s throat before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>This was fine. Normal. Agatha could exist in the same zip code as that ass without losing her grip on reality. She could be cool. Casual. Normal.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha should really look away. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t. </p><p> </p><p>She needed a minute. Maybe several.</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally settled into one of the loungers, legs stretched out and Agatha had never been more jealous of a goddamn piece of furniture in her life.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look. Not at first. She busied herself with nothing- adjusting her sunglasses, smoothing the hem of her shirt, pretending the view didn’t exist.</p><p> </p><p>But she could feel it. She always could.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her eyes low as long as she could, but the weight of it pressed against her until she caved and glanced up- </p><p> </p><p>Rio was already looking at her.</p><p> </p><p>Sunglasses slid halfway down her nose, brows arched just enough to ask a question she had no intention of saying out loud. Her mouth twitched, not quite a smirk. Relaxed. Confident.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Oh fuuuuuuuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could’ve ignored it. Looked away. Played dumb.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she reached for the hem of her shirt and started to peel it off, slow and methodical. Not for effect. Not to flirt. Just to prove she could. The fabric clung to her for half a second before giving way, sliding over her ribs, her chest, her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>By the time the shirt cleared her head, Rio’s gaze was glued to her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio licked her lips.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t purposeful. It wasn’t a move. Just instinct. A flash of tongue, barely there, quick and unconscious and somehow worse because of it. That single flash of tongue had Agatha’s brain shorting out entirely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to press her palms against untouched skin that had haunted her for years. To stake some long overdue claim on what always should’ve belonged to her. To make sure no one else ever- </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Get a grip. Get a fucking grip. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She dragged her gaze away from Rio and started toward the lounger beside her, trying not to trip over every thought currently screaming inside her head.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped into the lounger with a dramatic grunt, limbs sprawled,  surrendering to the sun instead of the situation.</p><p> </p><p>“You good?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Yep,” Agatha said, eyes pinned to the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel Rio’s brown eyes boring holes into the side of her skull. The full turn of her head, the deliberate silence- it was all so pointed it might as well have been spoken. Agatha could practically hear the smirk forming. Tongue against cheek. That stupid fucking tell Rio had never grown out of.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t see you put on sunscreen.”</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Here we go.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth pulled into a smirk before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>Of course that was the first thing out of Rio Vidal’s fucking mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had put it on at home -alone, in the bathroom, twisting to reach her back like an idiot- because it had felt like the smart thing to do. Her brain had made that call hours ago- before Rio’s face, her voice, and her insane ass had entered the equation. Now she was sitting here, half naked, bathed in sunlight and suddenly regretting every responsible decision she'd made before walking out the door.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t glance over. Just let the silence hang between them- almost daring Rio to fill it.</p><p> </p><p><em>Let her look, </em>Agatha’s brain whispered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha slid deeper into the lounger, arms stretching overhead, spine arching just slightly as she adjusted her weight. One leg bent at the knee, casual. Thoughtless. A move meant to get comfortable, except she knew exactly what it looked like.</p><p> </p><p>Just enough to make Agatha feel a little less stupid for doing everything right and still wanting to be touched.</p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha turned her head and looked at Rio, tight smile, “Already applied.” her voice light and immediately looked back up at the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio could say anything else, Agatha tipped her head back and looked up at the sky again- casual, dismissive, pretending the conversation bored her.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>But that wasn’t the point.</p><p> </p><p>“Reapply,” Rio said. Her voice was slow, bored, like the offer had just occurred to her. “I’ll help.”</p><p> </p><p>“I think I’m good.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked once. Her smile didn’t falter, but it froze- just a fraction too still. And then she looked away. She sank back into her lounger, casual, but her hands gave her away. They twitched once. Restless. Unused.</p><p> </p><p>One full second of silence later:</p><p> </p><p>“You sure?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Positive.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Right. Of course.” She crossed one ankle over the other. Her jaw worked. Like she was chewing on the words she wasn’t saying.</p><p> </p><p>Another pause, equally stupid:</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, not to brag,” Rio said, voice lighter again, “but I am exceptionally talented with sunscreen. It’s a skill, actually. Artful. Controlled. Even coverage.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed in response, not trying to hide her amusement. She turned on her side to face Rio, one arm tucked beneath her head. </p><p> </p><p>She didn’t say anything.</p><p> </p><p>Just looked at Rio. Let her talk. Let her fill the silence with nonsense and jokes and whatever this nervous energy she was trying to cover.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe Agatha should’ve cut it off. Should’ve made a comment. Should’ve protected herself.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Because maybe, for once, she just wanted to stay here. Inside a world where Rio was allowed to want her. Where Rio looked at her like that and didn’t try to hide it. Where Agatha didn’t have to shrink or laugh it off or be the one who wanted more.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe Agatha just wanted to know what it felt like to be wanted like this. Openly. Clumsily. Sweetly.</p><p> </p><p>To pretend this wasn’t new. That it hadn’t felt like it had taken a fucking lifetime to get here.</p><p> </p><p>So she let it happen.</p><p> </p><p>Let Rio ramble. Something about being an x-ray tech and knowing too much about radiation, so sunscreen was a moral duty. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t interrupt, didn’t fight the slow smile tugging at her mouth. And Rio, who caught it like a gift she wasn’t sure she deserved, went pink- blushing, embarrassed by her own stupidity and the fact that Agatha hadn’t looked away.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>As Rio launched into a rant about SPF ratings and preventable skin damage, hands fidgeting in her lap like she was trying not to reach. Agatha stretched her arm across the gap between their loungers and teasingly flicked at Rio’s fingers. </p><p> </p><p>She started to pull her hand back, but Rio caught it and guided it down to rest on her thigh. Agatha let it stay, her thumb brushing back and forth while Rio kept talking.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They ended up in the pool a little later, the water just above their waists. Agatha leaned back against the wall, letting the sun hit her face. Beside her, Rio faced the ledge, beer in one hand, phone in the other, the screen tilted just out of the sun. From the angle -and the muttering- Agatha could tell she was playing Connections, the New York Times word game where you grouped words into sets of four. Simple in theory. Mostly designed to piss people off.</p><p> </p><p>“‘Not Quite’ and ‘Warm’ have to go together… right?” Rio said under her breath. Her other arm stayed braced against the cement as she kept sorting tiles.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha noticed a woman passing outside the gate, walking a dog. Her gaze lingered for a second too long before moving on.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha glanced to the side. Just to double check that the water still covered what needed covering. That Rio’s ass wasn’t suddenly on full display for some random stranger and her golden retriever. </p><p> </p><p>That Rio, in her microscopic fucking bikini and complete lack of spatial awareness, wasn’t unintentionally putting on a show.</p><p> </p><p>It was. Barely.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t like Agatha minded other people looking. Rio had always been…lookable. That was just a fact.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just didn’t think a random woman walking her dog should get the same view she’d spent seventeen years earning by sheer endurance alone.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> You know. Seniority.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away before she could think too hard about why she cared. Or why she suddenly wanted to build a twelve foot privacy fence around the pool.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha started to feel cold.</p><p> </p><p>That was the only reason. Or it was the easiest one to reach for. The sun was still high, the water warm, but her skin prickled anyway. Something about the breeze, maybe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved closer until the side of her body pressed up against Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>The sudden contact had Rio straighten a little. Then she looked over at Agatha- eyebrows raised, mouth twitching at the corners. She didn’t say anything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t acknowledge her. She grabbed the bottle out of Rio’s hand, took a swig, then shoved it back without a word.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re overthinking it. It’s ‘Not Quite,’ ‘Warm,’ ‘Close,’ and ‘Almost,’” Agatha said finally, eyes still forward. “Stuff people say when they want you to keep trying.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at her, tongue pressed into her cheek like she was turning something over in her head. Agatha heard the quiet clink of her setting the bottle down, the dull tap of her phone beside it. Then Rio stepped in front of her.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha didn’t meet her eyes. She focused just past her shoulder, anywhere but Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Something in Agatha’s brain told her to move. <em> Swim. Get out while you still can. Before you forget how. Before you stop wanting safety more than you want her. </em></p><p> </p><p>Because wanting Rio had never been safe. It was the deep end without warning. No ledge to brace against. No solid ground under her feet. </p><p> </p><p>And for years, Agatha had taught herself how to survive it- how to tread water, keep her head above surface, hold her breath, and pretend she didn’t feel the pull building beneath her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha was tired. Her limbs ached from years of keeping herself afloat. She didn’t want the distance anymore. She didn’t want to keep pretending that effort was safety, or that staying above it meant she wasn’t already in too deep.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to tread water anymore. She wanted to let go of the surface. To sink, if that’s what this was. To stop resisting the current if Rio was the one waiting at the bottom.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at Rio and braced for a ruthless undercurrent.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t moving. Just watching her. Eyes fixed on her mouth like it was already a confession, like she could hear everything Agatha hadn’t said. There was something steady in it- something dangerous in how quiet she was being. It wasn’t a stare that asked permission. It was a warning.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze climbed, slow, until it met Agatha’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“You think it’s time to reapply sunscreen?” Rio murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt it then- that slow, creeping fullness in her chest. Like her lungs were filling with water. She swallowed hard, voice barely catching.</p><p> </p><p>“Not quite,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p><em> Stuff people say when they want you to keep trying, </em> she thought.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward, and suddenly their bodies were flush. Agatha’s breath caught at the sheer lack of fabric between them- Rio’s swimsuit barely there, her thigh brushing Agatha’s, her chest pressed close enough to steal the rest of her breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands twitched. They wanted to slide to Rio’s hips, to grip bare skin where that ridiculous thong bikini didn’t cover anything. But she didn’t move. Her fingers stayed locked around the edge of the pool, elbows digging hard into the cement like if she let go, she’d disappear under water.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached up- one hand at Agatha’s cheek, the other curling behind her neck, steady and certain. Agatha’s eyes squeezed shut. Her pulse, once loud and panicked, began to slip into something slower. Heavier. Like everything inside her was sinking, pulling downward by something she didn’t want to fight.</p><p> </p><p>The effort of staying above water, <em> above this </em>, suddenly felt pointless. With Rio that close, the surface wasn’t something she wanted anymore.</p><p> </p><p><em> Swim!  </em> Her brain screamed it. <em> Swim, now. Swim fast. You’re drowning. </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled her head back just enough to try and get Agatha to look at her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio didn’t let the current take Agatha slowly.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the water rush in. Let it flood her lungs. She never wanted to hear her name spoken any other way. Not ever again. She opened her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>And when she did, she was already being pulled under- willingly, stupidly, beautifully. Not fast enough. Not enough to satisfy the years of silence between them. She needed Rio to keep looking at her like that. To keep saying things she shouldn’t. To keep cracking open every place Agatha had sealed off.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha was going to drown, it had to be like this. Brutal. Beautiful. And by Rio’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t stop thinking about it,” Rio whispered, her thumb dragging across Agatha’s bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t mean to make a sound, but she did. The smallest whimper, slipping out before she could catch it.</p><p> </p><p>The space between them vanished one inch at a time, until Agatha could feel the heat of Rio's breath, and could count the seconds she had left to decide.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. Her body was no longer interested in escape.</p><p> </p><p>Their lips met- soft at first. Not all at once, but close. Just enough for Rio's mouth to brush against Agatha’s. A whisper of contact. Testing.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio pulled back half an inch, breath slipping out of her in a shaky, uneven exhale.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands, still gripping the ledge behind her, went slack.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her again, more confident this time, and Agatha felt it everywhere- at the base of her spine, in the bend of her knees, in the hollow part of her chest that had never stopped aching for this. She opened to it slowly, like the water she’d been trying not to drown in had finally gotten past her lips. She parted them, let Rio kiss her like she meant it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned, helpless, almost pained, at the way Agatha’s mouth gave way.</p><p> </p><p>She tilted Agatha’s face, just slightly, and kissed her deeper.</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing rushed about it. Just care. Hesitation. Want, edged with disbelief.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the way Rio's tongue slipped into her mouth like a question- gentle, searching, almost too careful. Like Rio was still afraid the permission might be taken back. Like she couldn’t believe she was being allowed to taste her like this a second time.</p><p> </p><p>And God, Agatha could feel it- how much Rio wanted this, how much she needed it to be enough. How Rio kissed her like she was trying to remember everything at once. Every place she’d missed. Every inch she’d never been given.</p><p> </p><p>It was different from the first.</p><p> </p><p>That first kiss had been fast, urgent, and almost clumsy in its need. They’d crashed into each other, desperate to make up for lost time, to learn every part of each other’s mouth they’d gone too long without. It hadn’t mattered what it looked like. Only what it sounded like. The breathless gasps. The swallowed moans. The quiet, stunned noises they hadn’t known the other could make.</p><p> </p><p>But this- </p><p><br />This was slower.</p><p> </p><p>This was intentional in every way that made Agatha ache.</p><p> </p><p>She felt it in the way Rio moved, in every careful shift of her mouth. She was still learning, still hungry, but she wasn’t rushing. She was memorizing. Tracing the shape of Agatha’s lips like she wanted to be able to draw them from memory.</p><p> </p><p>It was intimate in a way Agatha hadn’t prepared for. </p><p> </p><p>She let herself be kissed like that. Thoroughly. Reverently. Like Rio was tasting the ruins of something she thought she’d never find.</p><p> </p><p>They weren’t kissing like it was new. They were kissing like they’d already drowned and decided to build something down there anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Their own Atlantis. Unbreathable. Beautiful. Quiet.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha let go- and let the current pull her under completely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her deeper, sucking on Rio’s tongue before pushing her own forward. Their mouths stayed open, breath tangled between them as they leaned into each other, bodies shifting in sync. It was a give and take, neither of them fully in control, something between chasing and being caught.</p><p> </p><p>She needed Rio in a way that felt impossible. Her hands found her hips, fingers curling tight, thumbs pressed into bone hoping they might root her there, keep her from reaching further. But Agatha’s hands had been twitching from the second she saw her- since that first look at Rio’s ass in that damn bikini. </p><p> </p><p>It was right there. Bare. Obvious. Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched. Just once. Just enough to betray her. Any lower, and she wouldn’t be able to pretend she hadn’t meant it.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could stop herself, Rio shifted. Her hips pressed forward into Agatha’s front, like she knew exactly where Agatha’s hands had wanted to go. It wasn’t bold. It wasn’t showy. It was worse than that.</p><p> </p><p>It was quiet and confident. Rio wasn’t just pressing. She was calling Agatha’s bluff. Urging Agatha to stop pretending.</p><p> </p><p>The friction dragged a groan from Agatha’s mouth and pulled a soft gasp from Rio’s in return.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s thumbnails dug into Rio’s hips beneath the water, hard enough to leave a reminder. She needed something to stop her fingers from slipping lower, even though every inch of her was begging for it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pushed into her again.  The force of it pushed Agatha back into the ledge, her spine scraping against concrete. It stung. It helped. Her breath hitched in her throat, and she caught Rio’s bottom lip between her teeth and licked across the full length of it shamelessly, before diving back into her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>This time, Rio fought her for it. She kissed Agatha harder, rising onto her toes, shifting her body closer until every part of her was speaking loud and clear.</p><p> </p><p>Her hips tipped forward again, pressing into the space Agatha refused to take, and stayed there. Agatha could feel the invitation in every inch of her. The way Rio pushed close and held still. It was patient. It was a body that had nothing left to prove, and still chose to ask.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha’s hands were burning with the answer.</p><p> </p><p>Rio brought both hands to her face, cupped her cheeks like she couldn’t stand the distance, and kissed Agatha again as she dropped back onto flat feet. Her hips drove forward at the same time, harder this time, deliberate and filthy. A whine cracked out of Rio, high and rough, and she didn’t bother to hide it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard it for what it was. A plea from Rio. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Stop holding yourself back. It’s yours to touch. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved her hands moved to Rio’s ass, underwater and unashamed, fingers spreading across skin she’d spent years trying not to touch. She grabbed hard, no hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Her breath caught. Not because it was surprising -she’d imagined this more times than she could count- but because the reality was far better than anything she could’ve made up in the dark.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha filled her palms completely, adjusting her grip like she was trying to get it right, trying to match memory to muscle. It didn’t line up. The real thing was warmer. Softer. Heavier. Unbelievably close. Her thumbs swept along the top, pressed in, gripped harder. Her fingers flexed. Agatha felt the shift of muscle, the curve she’d memorized with her eyes but never her hands.</p><p> </p><p>She squeezed. Rio gasped into her mouth. Agatha didn’t stop. She kept touching, kept learning, because she couldn’t stop. She wanted to laugh. Or cry. Or drag her nails across skin and make Rio gasp again, just to hear it.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, Agatha pulled Rio closer.</p><p> </p><p>Their hips met with more force, water sloshing between them, and Agatha moaned into her mouth, helpless and grateful and furious with how long they had waited to do this.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t let go.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t sure she could.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was the one who pulled away. Barely. Just enough to breathe. Her hands stayed where they were, cupping Agatha’s face, fingers warm against her cheeks. Her thumbs brushing just under her eyes like she needed to know this was real. She didn’t step back. Didn’t try to move. She just looked at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Their breathing was ragged. Sharp and uneven, and comes only after you’ve gone too deep, stayed under too long, and come up with no grace at all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lungs burned.</p><p> </p><p>Not just from the lack of oxygen, but from everything else- what she’d been holding back, what she’d finally let herself have. Her grip on Rio didn’t loosen. Her hands were still firm around her ass, submerged and certain, fingers aching from how tightly she’d held on.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t move. Couldn’t. Wouldn’t. Not when her heart was still thudding in her chest, not when Rio’s body was still warm against hers, not when she could feel every place their skin touched and every place it still wanted to.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes lit up, soft and wide, lips parted, chest rising too fast. Her hands slid down to Agatha’s shoulders and she leaned in until their foreheads touched.</p><p> </p><p>Her breath escaped on a laugh. It wasn’t loud. It wasn’t smooth. It caught in the middle like it surprised her. The corners of her mouth pulled up into a smile that looked too big for her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the sound of it more than she heard it, their bodies still close, her grip still locked on Rio’s ass.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stayed there, breathing through the smile, not pulling away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move either.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio had invited her up to her apartment casually. Agatha had said yes. Told herself it was because she was nosey. Because she wanted to see where Rio lived now. Where she went home to at the end of the day. She wanted to know if Rio still flipped light switches with the back of her knuckles, if her taste in furniture had changed or if Agatha’s absence still lived in the negative space.</p><p> </p><p>They walked in silence for a bit, the wet heat of the afternoon still clinging to their skin. Rio broke it by pointing out the landscaping along the path, listing off the types of bushes the complex had planted- dwarf yaupon holly, viburnum, some kind of ornamental grass she couldn’t name but claimed was “a diva about sunlight.”  </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her talk. She was too busy cataloging everything: the curve of the path, the way Rio’s hand hovered at her lower back when they crossed the parking lot, and the click of the lock as Rio scanned her key fob and held the door open.</p><p> </p><p>Inside, the building was cool and quiet. They stepped into the elevator, and Rio stood closer than necessary. Their shoulders touched, and Rio didn’t shift away. Neither did Agatha. Her eyes were fixed upward, watching the floor numbers tick.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Sixth floor. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The doors opened with a soft ding. Rio stepped out first, her gait loose but purposeful, and Agatha followed. The hallway was long and clean, lined with muted gray carpet and identical white doors. They turned a corner, and Rio came to a stop.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Unit 69. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned and kissed two fingers before tapping them against the number plate. “Requested this one specifically,” she murmured, pushing the door open with her other hand. “For the vibes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Of course you did.” But she was smiling.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her breath as she stepped inside. The entryway was narrow and spare- just a long runner stretched across the hardwood floor, a slim table against one wall, a key hook above it, and a tall mirror that caught their reflections in pieces.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kicked off her flip flops by the door and gestured wordlessly. Agatha followed suit, toeing hers off beside Rio’s with the reluctance of someone who wasn’t sure how long they were staying but didn’t want to track in dirt. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything. She was too busy trying to listen for ghosts.</p><p> </p><p>The first time she’d been to Rio’s old place, it had been a disaster- crickety floorboards, a window that wouldn’t close all the way, plants too ambitious for the single patch of sunlight that came in sideways from the fire escape. The couch had been lopsided. A leak in the kitchen ceiling had made the light fixture unreliable. It was falling apart, but it had been full of Rio- clean, particular, always reorganizing a drawer one minute and trying to fix a cabinet hinge the next, which somehow made the whole door crooked. That apartment had felt like a stubborn kind of survival. Like Rio had carved it out with her teeth and dared anyone to call it permanent.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hung her keys on the hook with a casual flick of her wrist and padded down the hall like she didn’t need to explain anything. Agatha followed, noticing how clean the floor was beneath her feet, how the walls were unmarked by thumbtack holes or leftover tape. No signs of makeshift fixes or chaotic repairs. This place held itself up without effort.</p><p> </p><p>At the end of the hall, Rio turned right into the kitchen and flicked the light on with the back of her knuckle.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw it -of course she saw it, she was fucking looking for it- and something in her dropped. Not a fall, not a freefall, but a soft sinking. Recognition. Like remembering the rules of a language she hadn’t spoken in years.</p><p> </p><p>Rio knelt and began unloading leftover beers from the cooler, sliding them wordlessly into the fridge. Agatha didn’t follow her into the kitchen. Her eyes had already drifted forward, pulled toward the living room.</p><p> </p><p>It was warmer than she expected.  A rust colored couch sat pushed against a wall, its cushions deep and worn. A quilt was draped over the back, hand stitched by someone who cared enough to match the colors but not obsess over symmetry. Lilia, if Agatha had to guess.</p><p> </p><p>There were mismatched coasters on the coffee table, a glazed ceramic bowl full of bottle caps, and a half melted candle in a jar labeled 'tobacco flower.'</p><p> </p><p>The shelves above the couch were floating, wooden, staggered along the wall like stepping stones. One held a stack of books so dog eared they could’ve been reread a dozen times. Another, a row of small clay pots, each one housing a different kind of plant- some trailing, some upright, all reaching toward the soft light above.</p><p> </p><p>A hanging light glowed in the corner, shaped like a basket turned upside down, wicker suspended by a coiled rope that was tacked into the wall. It cast a dappled amber light over the room, warm as fire without the flame. Below it, a monstera stretched its leaves outward, broad and glossy.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t feel staged. It didn’t feel aspirational. It felt… settled<em>. </em></p><p> </p><p>And that was what knocked the wind out of Agatha most.</p><p> </p><p>The Rio she remembered had always been a little at war with her surroundings. Always compensating, always adjusting. Making do, never making permanent. And now, here she was- clearly not just living but rooted<em>. </em> Not fighting the space, but shaping it. Choosing softness. Keeping it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Her hands hung uselessly at her sides.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t the kind of place you crashed at. It was the kind of place you came home to. The kind of place you could miss<em>. </em></p><p> </p><p>And somehow, that realization hit harder than anything that happened all day.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her bag by the couch and drifted toward the curved bookcase against the wall- wooden, worn, filled with plants, trinkets, and a scattering of picture frames. Most of them were from the years Agatha had missed. The decade she spent in Chicago. A life that had gone on without her.</p><p> </p><p>The first photo that caught her eye was of Rio and Sage, standing in front of the wall outside Lilia’s house. Sage looked twelve, arms crossed with a dramatic scowl, backpack on. Rio stood behind her, arms slung around her neck, grinning like an idiot.</p><p> </p><p>It was a first day of school photo- Agatha could tell by the backpack, the timing, the wall. Even though Rio hadn’t been in school for almost a decade at that point, she still showed up for Sage, still stood there with her like it was her own first day too.</p><p> </p><p>She looked younger in it- too young. Like the version of Rio from the year Agatha left.</p><p> </p><p>Rio used to complain about those pictures, swore she only humored Lilia. But the next picture frame gave her away- third grade, gap toothed, drowning in a shirt two sizes too big. Agatha had always loved that picture. Still did.</p><p> </p><p>Next to it, a photo of the three of them -Rio, Sage, Lilia- smiling around what looked like Sunday dinner. Then another. That same dining table, but this time Sage was older. Alice and Jen were in that one too, all of them squeezed into frame, laughing at something that had already passed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest went tight.</p><p> </p><p>Then the next two photos stopped her cold.</p><p> </p><p>The first: Agatha, Jen, and Rio. They were in Rio’s old apartment- sitting on her old janky couch. Jen was on Agatha’s right, flipping off the camera. Agatha sat in the middle, knees tucked up, practically curled into Rio’s side. Her nose scrunched at the camera. Rio sat forward, bearing her teeth in a snarl, an unlit cigarette between them and Agatha’s old purple lighter gripped tightly in her hand. Natty Light cans cluttered the coffee table. They looked ridiculous. They looked inseparable.</p><p> </p><p>The second: just the two of them. A selfie. Late at night on Rio’s old fire escape, flash too bright, faces squished together. They were 23. It had been taken on Agatha’s phone. She remembered that night. Neither of them had been wearing shoes. The air smelled like rain and burnt toast from someone else’s kitchen. They were stupid and loud and close.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha picked up the frame and stared at it for a long time.</p><p> </p><p>She ached for the version of them frozen in it. The version that didn’t know what was coming. Back then, they’d been content with whatever they were, as long as they had each other. No demands. No confessions. Only that soft, unspoken loyalty neither of them dared name.</p><p> </p><p>And her heart ached- because after all this time, after everything that had happened, Rio had still kept the memory of them. Woven it into her life like it would always belong there, pain and all. A decade later, it was still there. In pictures. In her old stupid lighter Rio still carried around. Like some part of her had always known Agatha would come back.</p><p><br />Agatha didn’t know whether to laugh or cry or lose her mind entirely at the absurdity of it.</p><p> </p><p>“If you want to take a shower, you can use mine. I’ll use the guest one.” Rio’s voice came quietly from behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flinched, quickly sliding the frame back into place. She turned to find Rio standing there, arms crossed loose over her chest, her expression caught somewhere between regret and exposure- like she'd been seen too clearly. Like she knew Agatha had noticed the quiet ways she'd been held onto by Rio, and didn’t know what to do with it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything. She turned back to the bookshelf, eyes catching on another frame she hadn’t gotten to yet-</p><p><br />A photo of Rio and Alice at The Witches Road, both flipping off the camera like assholes. But it wasn’t that that stopped her. It was Rio. Blonde. Older. Maybe taken in the last few years. And hot.</p><p><br />Agatha blinked at it. Then blinked at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“You dyed your hair blonde?” Agatha asked, baffled.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh yeah. Like two years ago. It was fun.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed to herself. “Looked fun.”</p><p> </p><p>And it had. She absolutely did not hate Rio as a blonde. In fact, she looked hot as fuck, and Agatha deeply resented that she’d missed it. That she hadn’t been there to see it. That scarlet had shown up instead and ruined everything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned toward the couch to grab her things, and she could feel Rio watching her- like every step might be the one that took her out the door.</p><p> </p><p>Without looking up, Agatha nodded toward the other hallway, the one she assumed led to Rio’s bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>“Lead the way.”</p><p> </p><p>A small smile tugged at Rio’s lips. She gave a single nod and turned, guiding them down the hall. They passed two doors -guest bathroom, guest bedroom- before reaching the very back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her bag beside the bathroom door and stepped further into Rio’s room without waiting for permission. She didn’t even pretend not to be nosy. Rio had rifled through her mail the first time she ever stepped foot in Agatha’s house. Fair was fair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She leaned against the doorframe, arms crossed, eyes steady on Agatha’s back. Agatha could feel her watching, like Rio wasn’t sure if this was happening, or if Agatha might vanish again the moment she looked away.</p><p> </p><p>The room was simple, warm. A forest green comforter lay tangled on the bed, the sheets underneath startlingly white- an objectively insane choice, but somehow very Rio. A half finished mug of coffee sat on the nightstand, cold now, the words <em> “I drink demon blood” </em> printed across it. </p><p> </p><p>She let her gaze drift. A paperback lay facedown beside the mug, spine broken. One of the plants in the corner looked like it had outgrown its pot months ago, but was still thriving. Another hung from a hook by the window, leaves spilling lazily over the edge. There was a TV mounted across from the bed.</p><p> </p><p>And then Agatha saw it.</p><p> </p><p>The record player. Same one from Rio’s old place. But it was the stand it sat on top of that really stopped her- walnut, mid-century style, still scratched in the front from when Rio had scrapped it trying to get it out of the trunk. They’d found it together in the furniture section of a thrift store, sitting perfectly between a broken dresser and a glass coffee table. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had spotted the stand instantly, crouched like she was in a museum, checking the joints and the grain, already in love. She’d said, <em> “Mine,” </em>without looking back. Agatha had just sighed and gone to find someone to help them carry it while Rio stood beside it like someone might try to steal it from her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped closer, fingers brushing the wood. The cabinets were closed, but she didn’t need to look. She knew what was in there. The vinyl collection- alphabetized, obsessively so. Agatha had once tried to slip Amy Winehouse's <em> Back to Black </em>into the A’s just to fuck with Rio and she had almost lost a hand because Rio filed them by last name not first. </p><p> </p><p>She stared at the cabinet now and caught herself wondering- not if the record was still there, but if it still skipped on side B. She’d dropped it once, years ago, she doesn’t even remember how. Rio hadn't replaced it then. Said it sounded better that way.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe she was imagining it -maybe it was projection or vanity or the pathetic ache of wanting to matter- but standing here now, Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that Rio had probably played it. After she left.</p><p> </p><p>Not for closure. Just because some songs don’t stop sounding like someone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook the melody of <em> Back to Black </em> from her spine like a chill. It lingered anyway, humming somewhere deep in her ribs. She turned and walked toward the bathroom, passing Rio on the way. Neither of them said anything.</p><p> </p><p>She grabbed her bag from where she’d dropped it and brought it inside to Rio's bathroom, setting it on the counter. When she turned around, Rio was in the doorway, arms loose at her sides, gaze fixed somewhere over Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Uh, towels are in that cabinet,” Rio said quietly. “Soap and stuff’s already in the shower.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. “Cool.”</p><p><br />She wasn’t sure why her voice sounded hoarse. Only knew she suddenly couldn’t stand the damp cling of her t-shirt, or the cold swimsuit underneath, still wet from earlier.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded back. “Cool.” She breathed the word out. Then she stepped back and pulled the door halfway closed behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard the soft shuffle of her feet retreating, the creak of a drawer opening, the quiet hush of movement as Rio crossed her own bedroom. A moment later, her footsteps padded down the hall toward the guest bathroom. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood there for another second, alone with the echo of a scratched record and her own heartbeat.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Showering at Rio’s was a terrible idea.</p><p> </p><p>Eucalyptus hung in a bunch from the shower head, slightly browned at the edges, still fragrant in the steam. Agatha tried not to stare at it. </p><p> </p><p>She stood under the water, chest turned to the spray, hair still dry- no point washing it. She hadn’t gone under water in the pool- at least not physically. That, and she couldn’t stomach the idea of using Rio’s shampoo.</p><p> </p><p>The soap had been a reflex. Agatha didn’t think about it until the scent hit her- too clean, too sweet, familiar in a way that scraped at her ribs. It clung to her, buried itself in her skin, and the towel only made it worse. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had grabbed the first one she saw, thick and worn from use. The fabric reeked of Rio’s detergent, warm and chemical and so distinctly <em> hers </em> that Agatha nearly gagged on it. She tried not to think about how often Rio had used this exact towel, how many times she’d wrapped it around herself with dripping hair and bare shoulders. It was inescapable. Even after she got dressed, her own clothes couldn’t smother it. She still smelled like Rio. It had worked itself into every seam.</p><p> </p><p>They ended up on the couch, neither of them saying much. They sat close, but not touching, a careful few inches of space between them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had picked the movie- <em> Little Shop of Horrors </em>. She told herself it was because it was there, because it was safe, because she hadn’t thought it through until it was too late. Halfway in, she regretted it entirely.</p><p> </p><p>Rio used to play it on a loop until Agatha knew every line by heart. And now, with it playing softly in front of them, she wanted to vomit.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Not at the movie itself, but at the mushiness of it all. The softness. The stupid, sentimental instinct that made Agatha put it on in the first place. She could hear Rio mouthing along to “Skid Row (Downtown)” beside her without even thinking and it made her stomach turn.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t picked it to be kind. Or maybe she had. <em>She definitely had.</em> And that was the problem. It was so unlike her. Or maybe it wasn’t, maybe it was exactly like her. Maybe that’s why she hated it.</p><p> </p><p>Too earnest. Too exposed. Too obvious.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her eyes on the screen, jaw tight, fists curled in her lap like she could wring the weakness out of her palms. Rio scrolled through her phone like nothing had changed, humming the tune under her breath, still loving the same things. Still taking up space like she always had- quietly, relentlessly, without asking.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had let her. Had invited it. Hit play like it meant nothing. Like she wasn’t hoping Rio would notice.</p><p> </p><p>Like it wasn’t, in some fucked up way, a love letter.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m gonna ask you this,” Rio said finally, still looking at her phone. “And I fucking hope your answer’s changed in the last decade… What pizza do you like?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t help the way her lips curled and her hands relaxed. </p><p> </p><p>It was always this- pizza wars and smug grins and a total refusal to compromise. They had never once shared a pizza. Rio refused. Said Agatha’s choices were a war crime. Said she couldn’t stomach the idea of her own slice so much as brushing against the sludge Agatha ordered. They used to get two different pizza’s just to keep the peace, and even then, Rio would make a show of sealing Agatha's box closed like it was a biohazard.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. “Hawaiian.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio recoiled like she’d been physically slapped. “No. No, no, no. Agatha. Pineapple? You’re still- Jesus. You’re still doing this?”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s good,” Agatha said, smug now. “It’s sweet and salty. It’s balanced. Like… culinarily. It’s science.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fruit on cheese. That’s not science, that’s a hate crime.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tomatoes are fruit. Pizza sauce is fruit. You're already eating fruit, asshole.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tomatoes are barely fruit. They don’t count.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted. “You just don’t like it because you’re a coward. You fear flavor.”</p><p> </p><p>“I <em> fear </em> soggy crust and betrayal. Pineapple leaks juice, Agatha. It leaks. It seeps into everything. I used to taste the betrayal on my half when you ordered that garbage.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s why we got separate pizzas every time.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “Because I don’t believe in cross contamination.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so dramatic,” Agatha muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced at her, unimpressed. “I’ve had pineapple flavored crust trauma. I’m allowed to be dramatic.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still fiddling with the order, tapping her thumb against the phone screen like she was pretending this didn’t feel familiar. Like they hadn’t done this exact dance a dozen times before.</p><p> </p><p>“Same place?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Obviously.” Rio tossed her phone onto the cushion between them and leaned back, arms crossed. “Forty minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p> </p><p>They both looked at the screen again. The movie was still going- bright and absurd, soaked in sentiment.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The pizza showed up sometime after the second song in the credits, and they ate it straight from the boxes with cold beers and tired limbs. It was comfortable. Easy in the way old things sometimes were. Rio made a dramatic show of nearly retching every time Agatha reached for another slice of Hawaiian. Agatha rolled her eyes and kept eating. They talked. Nothing heavy. Only conversation that looped and meandered, full of jokes and interrupted stories.</p><p> </p><p>When they were done eating, neither of them moved. Agatha grabbed the quilt from the back of the couch and threw it over both their legs without comment. They still weren’t touching, not exactly, but they were close enough that it wouldn’t have taken much. Close enough that her bare knee kept brushing against Rio’s thigh whenever she adjusted. They kept talking. Kept laughing. Rio kept being fucking annoying.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, Rio stood and stretched, lazy and smug. “I’m stepping out for a cigarette,” she said, already walking toward the door. “Care to join?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Just stood and followed.</p><p> </p><p>The sun was nearly gone by the time they stepped onto the balcony. It was narrow but well used- two old metal chairs, a small round table with a single dead cigarette crushed into the ashtray. </p><p> </p><p>Bulb lights were strung overhead, screwed into the siding and the overhang, uneven and slightly drooping between bolts. One flickered every few seconds like it couldn’t make up its mind.</p><p> </p><p>There was only one hanging plant, a long, leafy thing by the sliding door that swayed in the breeze.  The rest were arranged along a simple wooden bench on the far end, nestled in mismatched pots- ceramic, clay, chipped enamel. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned her back against the railing, ashtray balanced beside her, cigarette lit and resting between two fingers. She took a slow inhale, letting it settle in her chest before she exhaled.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood beside her, bent over the railing, elbows resting against the rusted metal. She had a cigarette in one hand, smoke curling past her lips as she talked about how her old shithole apartment had somehow paid off. How she’d saved and waited and waited some more. How this place was finally hers. She liked it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded along, eyes drifting.</p><p> </p><p>Black hoodie. Black plaid boxers she wore as shorts. Rio’s hair was still in a loose bun at the nape of her neck, still slightly messy. Her gaze traveled up. The pieces that had fallen loose were tucked back into place, framing her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes caught on small black diamonds.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t register whatever Rio was saying by then. She cut in quietly, “Let me see how your piercings are healing.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She moved to step in front of Agatha. “They’re healing fine,” Rio said, offhand, but still turned her head to each side so Agatha could see.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached up and traced the shell of Rio’s right ear, fingertips gentle, eyes locked on the tiny black diamond she’d placed there herself. They suited Rio. Of course they did. </p><p> </p><p>Her hand fell without thought to Rio’s shoulder. Agatha took another inhale from her cigarette, turned her head, and blew the smoke out toward the sunset before flicking ash into the tray. </p><p> </p><p>“Any brawls or marriage proposals happen at work when you debuted them?” Agatha asked, lips curled into a smirk. Her fingers remained where they’d landed on Rio’s shoulder, slow, unmoving, and then, with barely any pressure, she tugged. Just once.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded like she was answering the question, even if she wasn’t. She took one last drag from her cigarette and hummed around it, then leaned past Agatha to stub it out. Her hands came to rest on the railing, one on each side of Agatha’s body, and she stepped in. Closer. A few inches between them now. Not even that. She blew the smoke to the side, her voice low. “So many, Agatha. I was fighting women off all night. It was vicious. Bloody.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fake pouted, lips curved. “Poor baby.” Her fingers moved along the seam of Rio’s shoulder lazily.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah. Poor me.” Rio’s voice dropped a little, teasing. “I was promised backup, and someone bailed.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was working,” Agatha said, amused. “Keeping babies from trying to crawl toward the light.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mm.” Rio squinted like she was pretending to weigh that. “Valid. But I’ll have you know it got dicey out there. I almost died.”</p><p> </p><p> “Eh. You survived.” Agatha shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>“By the skin of my teeth.” Rio grinned and snapped her teeth in Agatha’s direction like she might actually bite her.</p><p> </p><p>The gap between Rio's teeth had never once stopped being endearing, not even when Agatha tried to pretend it had.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snuffed her cigarette in the tray beside her and shook her head. “Weirdo.” She was still smiling, cheeks aching from it.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t see you complaining,” Rio said, nodding between their bodies like their closeness was all the proof she needed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Instead, she let her hand drift from Rio’s shoulder, fingers trailing up to the back of her neck.  She didn’t think about whether it was a good idea. She didn’t calculate the fallout. She just did what she wanted to do. For once. Without justifying it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Their mouths met gently, and Agatha held there- without urgency, without force. Just the soft, certain press of her lips to Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch or fall back. She breathed out against Agatha’s mouth and kissed her again. This time longer. This time with more certainty.</p><p> </p><p>Then again.</p><p> </p><p>And again.</p><p> </p><p>Each one a little fuller than the last. Each one asking a question and receiving the same answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let it happen. Let herself want it. She didn’t rush or overthink it, didn’t try to force meaning onto the moment, but she felt the way her body stilled into it. The way her hands softened where they touched Rio. The way the air around them seemed to narrow until all she could feel was Rio’s breath, her mouth, the way she kept coming back like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally pulled back, she didn’t go far. Her hands found their way to Rio’s waist, resting there for a beat before curling under the hem of her hoodie. She glanced down at the space between them and how little of it there was. The fabric gave easily, and her palms slipped beneath, coming to rest against Rio’s bare back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled when Agatha touched her like that- fully, soundlessly. When Agatha pulled her in, arms wrapped around her like she had every right. Rio went without resistance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let herself explore. Her fingers traced the familiar shape of Rio’s spine, nails lightly dragging as if to mark her place. She didn’t know why she was doing it except that she could. Rio’s arms closed around Agatha’s shoulders like a sigh. Agatha felt the brush of lips against her hair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. She had to. Everything in her felt like it was turning inside out. The closeness. The stillness. The goddamn kindness of it. Not just now, but all day. Every stupid softness she'd let herself accept. She breathed out shakily, trying to reel herself in. Her voice, when it came, barely cleared her throat. “I should probably go home.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move at first. Then she shifted back just enough to meet Agatha eyes. “I want you to stay,” Rio said softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes slammed shut this time, too fast, trying to block out the words by refusing to look at them.</p><p> </p><p>Once, she would’ve done anything to hear that. Would’ve set the world on fire to be wanted like that. And now here it was, handed to her plain and unadorned.</p><p> </p><p>And she couldn’t even look at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio must have seen it- the way Agatha’s body stilled, the way her hands gripped tighter like she was bracing for the impact of something unspoken. She pulled back even more, softening her tone like she could smooth it over.</p><p> </p><p>“Just to hang out,” Rio added quickly, eyes flicking down and then back. “That’s all. If you want.” A pause. Then quieter: “You should stay.”</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha whispered. </p><p> </p><p>That would’ve always been the answer. No matter the time. No matter the cost. If Rio ever asked, the answer would always be yes. It had never been anything else.</p><p> </p><p>But still, Agatha played at indifference. Still, she pretended her heart hadn’t just fallen out of her mouth and landed -whole and stupidly willing- in the hands of the one person she’d never been able to take it back from.</p><p>

      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Howdy, ladies, gays, and theys. Before y’all dive in, a quick note:</p><p>It seems I may have… mathed incorrectly. Not that I’m surprised, but it turns out that not only am I terrible at math but also remembering what year it is, which is why I’ve kept most dates and ages vague on purpose. That said, I did go back and make a few small adjustments- Agathario’s “fifteen years of knowing each other” is now seventeen, and I also tweaked the year Wagatha got married/Sage got adopted. Will the timeline still make perfect sense? I can only hope for the best. But the beauty of fanfiction is that it doesn’t have to.</p><p>So if you notice the math isn’t mathing, I beg you! look away! And please forgive me! I knew not what I was doing (iykyk hehehe).</p><p>Lastly, there is now a Pinterest board for this fic.

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>It had been two weeks since Agatha kissed Rio on the balcony and then, for reasons she hadn’t fully justified even to herself, decided not to kiss her again.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>They hadn’t talked about it. Which, in Agatha’s opinion, was <em> technically different </em> from how things would’ve gone ten years ago. It was just easier to let it exist somewhere else. This was different. It was space. Breathing room. A mutual pause. Acknowledged, if only by the fact that neither of them pretended it hadn’t happened. And that, Agatha told herself, was something. </p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>She’d stayed the night, that first time. On the couch. With Rio. Which wasn’t romantic so much as logistical… and incredibly stupid. They'd both insisted it was fine, and then promptly not slept. At some point, Rio’s arm had ended up across her legs, the blanket twisted halfway off the couch, and Agatha had woken up sore, annoyed, and still not ready to leave.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha hung around the next morning. Rio made her coffee, which she begrudgingly admitted was leagues better than the sad, watery excuse her Keurig had been churning out for months. Then Rio made breakfast like it was no big deal -eggs, toast, something green Agatha absolutely refused to identify- and somehow, neither of them commented on the fact that she hadn’t left yet.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha didn’t end up leaving until sometime after one. On her way out, she hovered by Rio’s curved bookcase, pretending not to stare at the photo of her, Rio, and Jen in Rio’s old apartment. </p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha glanced toward the hallway. Rio was still in her room, on the phone with Sage, her voice was muffled.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Without thinking, Agatha reached for the frame and slipped it into her bag.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>It wasn’t a power move. Or petty. She just… wanted it. Like how people steal rocks from beaches or pens from restaurants. Except this one had her face on it, so she figured that made it fair game.</p><p> </p><p>Rio came out just as Agatha was sliding the photo into her bag. Agatha looked up and offered her best <em> no, I did not just commit mild sentimental theft </em> smile.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio noticed the empty space on the shelf, she didn’t mention it.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Rio walked her to her car. And Agatha got in. Drove off. Didn’t look back.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>The photo stayed tucked in her bag, pressing lightly against her side the whole way home.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>After that, they kept seeing each other.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Not every day. But often enough that it stopped feeling incidental. The <em> thing </em>they’d fallen into didn’t feel like a return to the past- it felt like a negotiation. Like Agatha was learning what it meant to let someone back in without forfeiting ground.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>She’d been to Rio’s place three times since that morning. Once for dinner. Once while Rio did laundry and Agatha pretended to read. And once for no reason at all- just to be there. That one sat with Agatha the longest.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Rio had come over, too. Helped her put together a shelf, though it was less collaborative and more Agatha watching while Rio quietly did all the work. They ate takeout on the floor and put on a movie neither of them cared about. Agatha could barely remember the title. What she remembered was the way their knees stayed pressed together the entire time.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>They didn’t kiss again.</p><p> </p><p>But there were touches that didn’t excuse themselves. Glances that lingered a second too long. A knee brushing hers under a table. Fingers grazing across a countertop. Rio’s palm resting between Agatha’s shoulder blades when she leaned forward to say something in a loud room.</p><p> </p><p>They went to game night separately. Sat next to each other anyway. Agatha laughed too hard at something Rio said and had to excuse herself.  She didn’t come back until her face stopped betraying her. She avoided the pointed stares from Jen and Alice for the rest of the night, both of whom looked ready to extract confessions through physical force if necessary.</p><p> </p><p>One Sunday, there was a special breakfast with coworkers. Agatha had invited her on the walk to Agatha’s car. It was a passing offer, barely even a sentence but Rio’s face had lit up so entirely unfiltered and stupidly honest. Rio tried to smother it, tried to play it cool, but Agatha had already seen it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had to look away. Her chest was too full. Rio’s face alone had nearly taken her out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio ended up across from her at the table, then next to her when someone else wanted the seat so they could talk to Jen. Their knees touched under the table. Neither of them moved.</p><p> </p><p>And still, they hadn’t kissed again.</p><p> </p><p>It would’ve been easy. That was the thing. It would’ve been so goddamn easy to lean in. To let it happen again, under the right conditions, with the right excuse.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>And this wasn’t because she was spiraling. This wasn’t slipping back into a version of them that had already failed once. She’d kissed Rio three times- once would’ve been forgivable, twice unfortunate, but three? That was a pattern. That was admitting she wanted more. So she didn’t do it again. She didn’t ask. Didn’t lean in. She told herself she was being careful. Smart.</p><p> </p><p>But some days, the panic still curled around her spine- hot, insistant, hard to ignore. Not about the past but about what this might be turning into. About the terrifying possibility that they were actually doing something right this time.</p><p> </p><p>So she kept space in her life on purpose. Made time for herself. Said yes to drinks with Jen. Spent her evenings at the gym, earbuds in, volume high. She didn’t cut herself off from Rio, but she didn’t disappear into it either.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed to believe she had kept something of herself untouched. Just so there’d be something left of her to walk away with incase this ended. </p><p> </p><p>Then maybe Agatha could say it hadn’t meant everything. </p><p> </p><p>Even if it had.</p><p> </p><p>But deep down, beneath every lie Agatha could almost believe, something quieter lived: the certainty that what was untouched had already been seen. And worse- welcomed.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat cross legged on the bed, the bottle of black nail polish uncapped on a towel between them. She had just started painting Rio’s left hand, holding it gently as she dragged the brush across each nail. The other hand, already finished, rested on her knee. It had been there for a while. Neither of them mentioned it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still, suspiciously still, as she painted. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing. She kept her eyes down, painting each nail with careful, practiced strokes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, of course, couldn’t let that last.</p><p> </p><p>“Let’s play twenty questions,” Rio said, casually. </p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said without looking up.</p><p> </p><p> “Cool. I’ll go first.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose. “That’s not-”</p><p> </p><p>“Am I bad kisser?”</p><p> </p><p>The brush paused, mid air. Agatha blinked once, then looked up, “Why?”</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Rio shrugged, eyes sliding to the side.  “Oh, well. You know. Someone asked, and I thought- hm. Why don’t I ask Ag-”</p><p> </p><p>“Who the fuck is wondering about your kissing skills?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked, caught off guard. “What? No- no one important. And that wasn’t the question.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw locked. Her vision whitened at the edges. She wasn’t jealous. That would have required giving a fuck. It was just ridiculous. Who asked something like that? Who thought they could?</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t get to skip mine,” Agatha said flatly.</p><p> </p><p>“I asked first! It’s a yes or no question. So… yes or no. Am I a good kisser?”</p><p> </p><p>“I just don’t get why someone needs to know. Like is there a follow up planned? Are they trying to kiss y-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught the end of the question as it twisted out of her mouth. She didn’t stop because she lost her nerve. She stopped because she finally heard how she had sounded. The edge in her voice wasn’t neutral. It was personal, and it was obvious. Her own question wasn’t about the game anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Rio said nothing. Only looked at Agatha, shoulders loose, lips pressed together like she might smile, like she might say more if Agatha gave her an inch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned back to the bottle. Tapped the brush once against the rim.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t know it was up for peer review,” she muttered, and moved on to Rio’s middle finger. </p><p> </p><p>“No one’s asked,” Rio admitted quietly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt something in her shoulders let go. She pressed her bottom lip between her teeth, held it there, and didn’t say anything. It was a stupid thing to feel relieved about. She felt it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted. and Agatha could feel her staring.</p><p> </p><p>“I just… think maybe you aren’t answering because… I don’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose and kept her gaze locked on Rio’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>“We haven’t, you know. Since-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t take the bait. Just moved on to the next finger. Perfect strokes. Steady hand. Her face, however, was getting warm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “It’s fine if you don’t want to. I just… figured if it was because I sucked, I’d rather know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand with more pressure than necessary. It wasn’t a mistake. It was a warning. </p><p> </p><p>“Ow,” Rio said lightly, trying to make a joke of it. “Cool. Torture me in silence.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re the one who brought it up,” Agatha muttered. </p><p> </p><p>“Because we kissed.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally looked up, brows raised. “And now you want me to give you a grade on it?” </p><p> </p><p>Rio flushed and looked away. “Forget it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went back to painting, jaw tight. The next nail came out smudged. She wiped it clean and started again.</p><p> </p><p>Fuck, she was annoyed. Annoyed that for one stupid second, she thought someone else had wanted to kiss Rio. Annoyed that it got to her. Annoyed at the way Rio’s big, miserable brown eyes burning a hole straight through her forehead. And most of all, she was annoyed because the hand resting on her knee had gone slack -like Rio had pulled away, or was about to- and that ache in her chest wasn’t subtle anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated the whole thing. The look. The silence. The part of her that cared. She knew she was being unfair. </p><p> </p><p>“Just so you know,” Agatha said flatly, not looking up, “you’re not bad at it.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, trying and failing not to sound too pleased. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Two seconds of silence.</p><p> </p><p>“Are we gonna kiss again?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her then.</p><p> </p><p>Of course she wanted to kiss Rio again. She always had. That had been the problem from the very start. It wasn’t just once, or twice, or the last time. It was every version of her. Every glance across a room. Every time they got too close to saying something they shouldn’t. Every silence that squeezed tight like a hand around a throat.</p><p> </p><p>There had never been a version of Rio Agatha didn’t want.</p><p> </p><p>That was the part Agatha could never quite make peace with. It never dulled, never gave her room to outgrow.  And somehow, it still caught her off guard. Every single time.</p><p> </p><p>She looked down at the last nail and corrected a smudge that wasn’t there. It gave her something to do. Something to control.</p><p> </p><p>“If I say yes, will you stop talking?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Fine. Then yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. “That a real yes?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood. “It’s a shut up before I change my mind yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Still counts.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look back. But her ears were warm. And she absolutely knew it still counted.</p><p> </p><p>She took the bottle of black polish and walked into the bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>The drawer was already open. Everything inside was lined up- nail files, cotton pads, cuticle oil, everything in its place. The polish had a designated spot.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it for a second too long, then set the bottle down and closed the drawer quietly.</p><p> </p><p>When she came back, Rio was leaned back against the headboard, legs stretched out, watching some documentary about the ocean.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat beside her. Not too close. Not far either. She tried to focus on the screen.</p><p> </p><p>A narrator droned on about migration patterns and instinct. Something about the way certain fish followed the same path every year, even when they didn’t know why.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crossed her arms.</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” Rio said, eyes not leaving the screen. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her gaze forward, but every part of her had turned toward the sound of Rio’s voice. It always did. </p><p> </p><p>“I quite like kissing you.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha hated how her pulse reacted.</p><p> </p><p>For years, everything between them had existed in what they didn’t say. That was how they survived it- through silence, through the comfort of what never had to be spoken. That was the one thing Rio had always understood. She used to live inside it with Agatha, as if the quiet was sacred.</p><p> </p><p>But lately, Rio had started breaking the rules. She had started letting the quiet fill up with real words. Saying things out loud that were never supposed to be spoken. Things they used to leave alone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t figured out how to stay intact when that happened. She could manage silence. She was built for it. But this left her exposed in ways she didn’t know how to cover.</p><p> </p><p>Though Rio had figured it out, hadn’t she? That if she talked enough, Agatha wouldn’t have anywhere left to hide.</p><p> </p><p>And if there was nowhere left to hide, it got harder to move anywhere that wasn’t toward Rio. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha thought about answering. She thought about denying it or joking or acting like she hadn’t heard. But none of those options felt available anymore. Not when Rio said things like that without fear.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha stayed where she was, her posture careful, her jaw set.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Agatha said, as evenly as she could manage.</p><p> </p><p>A moment passed. Rio reached over and rested her hand on Agatha’s thigh, fingers splayed gentle and careful, mindful not to smear the half dry polish on her nails. Her thumb pressed into Agatha’s thigh. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She didn’t breathe too hard. She told herself not to react.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio spoke again.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want me to keep talking?” she asked, softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her gaze drop to Rio’s hand resting on her thigh. She followed the shape of it- the curve of Rio’s knuckles, the pale blue veins running up her wrist, the black polish Agatha had painted there. It was perfect. Hers.</p><p> </p><p>She shouldn’t have cared about that detail. But she did.</p><p> </p><p>It was proof of something. Another mark that was Agatha’s. Another small thing added to a life that hadn’t felt like hers in a long time. Not when she was married. Not when she was making decisions that belonged to other people. But this- this was different. Agatha had put that color there. Her hands had made it so.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard and looked back at the screen. She forced herself to breathe evenly. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded once.</p><p> </p><p>Because yes. She wanted Rio to keep talking. She wanted to hear every word she’d missed, every thought Rio hadn’t said until now. She wanted it so badly it made her ache. But the only thing she could give her was that single, careful nod.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look at her, kept her eyes fixed on the screen. Her thumb stayed still, pressing into Agatha’s skin. “I want to kiss you again,” Rio said softly. “I think about it all the time. More than I probably should.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled, eyes fluttering shut.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was a siren, and Agatha would follow her straight into the ocean if it meant that voice was the last thing she ever heard.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumb began to move, brushing gently back and forth. Agatha’s skin rose to meet it- goosebumps followed instantly. Rio must’ve noticed; her hand paused, lifted slightly. Agatha imagined her studying the reaction her touch had caused.</p><p> </p><p>A moment passed, Rio’s fingers returned, tracing a path up and down Agatha’s thigh. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek to keep quiet. But her body didn’t cooperate. Her thighs shifted, parted slightly, unthinking. She forced her eyes open, needing to see it. The way Rio’s hand moved. The shape of it.</p><p> </p><p>“I think about it in line at the store, walking to my car, sitting at work with nothing to do,” Rio said, voice even. She paused, exhaled a shaky breath, then added- quieter this time, “Pretty much anywhere I exist.”</p><p> </p><p>She felt the shift when Rio turned toward her, subtle but unmistakable. Her hand left Agatha’s thigh, and for a second, Agatha mourned the loss of it- right up until her other hand found her cheek instead. Warm. Undeniable. A soft tug, asking without words for her to look. So Agatha did.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes landed on Rio’s mouth before they found anything else.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thumb traced lightly across her cheek as she tilted her head, eyes a darker shade of brown than usual. “I’d like to kiss you now,” she murmured. “If that’s okay.”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck yes,” Agatha breathed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled her in without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing tentative about it. Rio’s tongue pressed for entry instantly, and Agatha gave it to her willingly. </p><p> </p><p>The moment she let Rio deepen the kiss, Agatha moaned- helpless and so fucking desperate. It felt like Rio needed to taste every part of her, like she’d been starved of it. There was no room for doubt in the way Rio’s mouth moved against hers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely had time to catch up before Rio’s hand slipped from her cheek and found her hip. Her fingers toyed with the hem of Agatha’s shirt before slipping underneath, nails dragging lightly across skin. She found the curve of Agatha’s hip bone and anchored herself there, thumb pressing firmly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t go further. She just held her there, thumb stroking once, steady, like that single point of contact was enough.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe it was.</p><p> </p><p>Because for all the fire in Rio’s mouth, her hand stayed still. Grounded. Rooted. Like she was reminding them both this wasn’t about rushing. It was about having. About being allowed to want, and finally -finally- getting to touch. </p><p> </p><p>And the feeling crept in slowly.</p><p> </p><p>The realization of what would happen if Agatha didn’t stop this. If Agatha let it keep going. If she let herself believe there was a version of this that could last longer than the kiss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t mean to. Her hands moved without her. Just enough pressure against Rio’s shoulders to make her stop.</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused, lips still close, breath brushing Agatha’s skin. She hadn’t pulled back fully. Her eyes were still on Agatha’s mouth, and she looked like she’d follow it anywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest ached. She had spent so long knowing absence that presence -real, safe, offered freely- felt almost violent.</p><p> </p><p>“I think…” Her voice caught. She cleared her throat, tried again. “We should probably move to the living room.”</p><p> </p><p>There it was.</p><p> </p><p>The softest escape route Agatha could find.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up, finally meeting hers. There was a flicker of something there, hurt, maybe, or understanding, but it passed quickly. She nodded once, careful.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s okay,” she said, barely above a whisper.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t push. She didn’t ask why.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha heard the rest anyway- unspoken but deafening.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> I’ll try again tomorrow. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>And beneath all her restraint, beneath all the armor she hadn’t meant to put back on-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hoped she would.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They did move to the living room. And true to form, Rio didn’t make it awkward. She steered away from the moment entirely, settling Agatha in the smallest, most deliberate ways. She turned on trash reality television. She made space for Agatha on the couch. She kept the mood light. There was no pause in her laughter, no dimming in her eyes. She was still herself and somehow that made it easier for Agatha to follow. To laugh. To pretend nothing had happened, at least for now.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, Agatha’s eyes drifted toward the curved bookshelf. She had avoided it until now. That wall of Rio’s apartment had become a quiet threat. She hadn’t wanted to see the empty space where the photo used to be. The one she stole. She hadn’t wanted to risk a question Rio might ask.</p><p> </p><p>But the space wasn’t empty anymore.</p><p> </p><p>A new frame had taken its place. This time it was a group photo from a game night at Jen and Alice’s rental over a decade ago. Jen was in Alice’s lap, beaming. Agatha sat on the couch, mid laugh. And Rio was on the floor between Agatha’s legs, flipping off the camera with both hands.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched. The urge to steal it hit fast and familiar. She wouldn’t. Or at least not yet.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had practically launched herself out of the apartment. She told herself it was casual but the truth was she couldn’t sit there any longer without doing something she’d regret. They’d only been watching TV, but that hadn’t stopped her brain from drifting somewhere else entirely.</p><p> </p><p>It kept drifting, circling back to the bedroom, to Rio’s voice, to the memory of her mouth. Not even the show could distract her- though Rio had looked genuinely entertained by middle aged women throwing wine at each other, cool as a fucking cucumber.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, meanwhile, couldn’t focus on a single damn word.</p><p> </p><p>It was infuriating.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted Rio’s attention so badly she could feel it buzzing in her teeth. Every time she looked over, her eyes snagged on black nail polish and her brain would spiral again. Just glancing at them felt like they were taunting her like a fucking billboard:</p><p>
  <em> Best Hands on the East Coast- Declared by Agnes, Confirmed by Vibes. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Her whole body burned with it. She hated how easy it was for her mind to go there. She hated how much she wanted to be touched, how badly she wanted it to be Rio.</p><p> </p><p>It was humiliating, the way her body responded to absolutely nothing but possibility.</p><p> </p><p>Which was exactly why Agatha had to leave.</p><p> </p><p>And now here they were. Rio walking Agatha to her car.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the sharp edge of the picture frame digging into her side through the fabric of her canvas bag. Good. Let it hurt. She needed the distraction. </p><p> </p><p>When they got to the car, Rio lingered with her arms crossed, tongue pressed into her cheek. Not the usual smug, flirty look- this was different. Thoughtful. Cautious. Agatha knew Rio was turning something over in her head but hadn’t decided if it was worth saying out loud.</p><p> </p><p>“Tomorrow’s Tuesday,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Fuck.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Of all the things that could come out of Rio Vidal’s fucking mouth. It had to be that.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia’s Sunday night dinners- now Tuesday night dinners.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away. She stared out across the parking lot, jaw tight, shoulders tense. She gave a small, noncommittal hum, just enough to acknowledge she’d heard. Not enough to engage.</p><p> </p><p>She already knew what her answer was going to be. But she would let Rio try. That much, at least, Agatha could give her.</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia misses you,” Rio said. “You should come.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t cruel. It wasn’t defensive. Just… simple. Honest.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia… well. Fourteen years was a long time to let bitterness sink into your bones. Agatha knew that feeling. She had nurtured it herself.</p><p> </p><p>Even if Lilia did hate her -which, deep down, Agatha knew wasn’t true- she couldn’t walk back into that house and pretend the walls didn’t remember her. The chairs. The table. The way everything would look the same, but not.<br />Sage would be there now. Maybe others.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t want to witness how easily the world stitched itself back together around her absence. Lilia’s house had once been a salvation, the first place that had ever truly felt like a home to come back to. She had spent two years of holidays, of Sunday dinners, cradled in that warmth because she had nowhere else to go.</p><p> </p><p>More than anything, Agatha didn’t think she could survive seeing a seat at the table saved for her.</p><p> </p><p>She saw it sometimes in her dreams, always the same: an empty table, stripped of food and noise and life, just one chair pulled out like an offering. A light that would fall only there like a spotlight on a stage. The chair didn’t beckon. It didn’t accuse. It just existed- quiet and certain, like it still believed she might return.</p><p> </p><p>And every time, Agatha woke up feeling like she’d left something behind she was never meant to.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said again, quieter this time. Rio hadn’t repeated the invitation, but Agatha still had to say it.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, with a nod. “No worries. Maybe next week.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t sound hurt. She didn’t sound surprised. She sounded like she understood.</p><p> </p><p>And just like before, Agatha didn’t hear the words exactly, but they echoed anyway.</p><p>
  <br />
  <em>I’ll try again tomorrow.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother saying her answer would still be no next week.</p><p> </p><p>“I should probably get home,” Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. I’ll see you soon?”</p><p> </p><p>That question Agatha could answer without thinking. She’d see Rio again. She didn’t know when or how or under what excuse, but it didn’t matter. It would happen. Of all the things in her life that felt uncertain, Rio wasn’t one of them.</p><p> </p><p>Not anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded and stepped forward to open her car door for her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tossed her bag into the passenger seat and started to climb in. She didn’t look at Rio because nothing had changed. She still wanted her. Still ached for her. It was the easiest thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p>But if Agatha let it happen there’d be no pretending left. No careful pacing. They’d have to talk. About everything. About the years they lost and the silences they built and the ways they both let it happen. She’d ask why Rio never said anything. Why she didn’t. Why it took them this long to get here.</p><p> </p><p>And then what?</p><p><br />If they finally gave in and it didn’t work?</p><p> </p><p>They’d ruin it for real. Not like before. Before was passive. Before was silence. Before was a slow forgetting.</p><p><br />But this would be active. Final. Something they couldn’t take back.</p><p> </p><p>They managed to destroy their friendship without ever touching the truth and Agatha wasn’t sure she’d survive watching it die because they finally did.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio poked her- two fingers to her shoulder, light and annoying on purpose. It was a touch that said ‘<em> I could be serious, but I’d rather let you decide.’ </em> Her other hand rested on the edge of the car door. “Are you okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned fast, startled by the break in silence. It took her a second to register the question. Her mind was still tangled in whatever she hadn’t let herself say. When she did, her eyes flicked up, catching the way Rio’s fingers tightened just slightly on the top of the door, the way she held her posture like she was bracing for impact. But none of it showed in her expression. Her face stayed soft, unreadable. Like she was waiting to be told what came next and had already decided she wouldn’t fight it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled. “Yeah, I’m just-” She huffed a short, breathy laugh, then shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>Two seconds. </p><p> </p><p>That’s all Agatha gave herself before defaulting to the biggest lie she’s ever told herself. </p><p> </p><p>And she had always been a bit wicked.  </p><p> </p><p>“We’re friends. Right?”</p><p> </p><p>A reminder. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was trying to say it before someone else could forget. A line being redrawn- not to punish, but to protect. Maybe not even Rio. Maybe just herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyebrows lifted slightly, and her mouth pressed into a thin line. But other than that her expression didn’t change much.</p><p> </p><p> “Yeah.” </p><p> </p><p>A pause.  </p><p> </p><p> Rio’s voice softened, “Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Whatever Agatha needed to believe in this moment, Rio would give her.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha didn’t regret saying it. Not exactly. It was the only way she knew how to pull back. However, beneath all that carefully managed distance, she hoped Rio heard the space between Agatha’s words and would wait for her there.<br /><br /></p><p>Because Agatha already knew- by the time morning came, she’d want to take it back.</p><p><br />And maybe again the next day.</p><p><br />And probably the day after that, too.</p><p> </p><p>Fortunately for Rio, Agatha had always had a soft spot for invasive species- the type that take root quietly, spread without permission, and somehow make the place feel more alive once they’ve ruined everything else.</p><p> </p><p>Didn’t mean she wouldn’t fight them every inch of the way. Rip them out. Pretend she hadn’t watered them. Act surprised when they kept coming back.</p><p> </p><p>Some things thrive under neglect.<br /><br /></p><p>Rio, apparently, was one of them.</p><p> </p><p>Just as Agatha opened her mouth to affectionately threaten Rio about closing her damn door before she floored it and peeled off-</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved.</p><p> </p><p>Closed in, actually.</p><p> </p><p>At a pace far too fast and nowhere near fast enough. One of those agonizing, unmistakable trajectories that gave Agatha ample time to react, deflect, maybe even mock. But she didn’t. Couldn’t. Wouldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand found her cheek and tilted her mouth up- gentle, weirdly practiced, utterly self assured. Their mouths collided like an argument neither of them wanted to win.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, the brilliant, miserable idiot that she was, met her halfway like a girl starved. No pause. No restraint. Just opened her mouth for Rio, wide and warm and easy.  Honestly. She didn’t even try to make Rio work for it.</p><p> </p><p>Her right hand slid into Rio’s hair, fingers curling at the nape to pull her closer, deeper. Rio hummed into her mouth, low and pleased. Agatha felt it in her teeth, her throat, somewhere ancient in her ribcage that hadn’t stopped aching since they were stupid and younger and ruining everything by doing absolutely nothing about it.</p><p> </p><p>It was obscene. Awkward angle, too much tongue, entirely too desperate. It wasn’t graceful. It wasn’t gentle. It wasn’t even supposed to happen.</p><p> </p><p>And still-</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally pulled back, Agatha stayed frozen- fingers still tangled in the back of her hair hoping her grip might keep time from moving forward. Rio’s lips were pink and swollen, her breath puffing against Agatha’s mouth, and then because god has no mercy and hated Agatha Harkness:</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face split into that maddening grin- white teeth, gap toothed, eyes bright with victory.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Smug. So fucking smug. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>And then, to make matters exponentially worse, Rio opened her stupid fucking mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“See ya later. <em> Friend</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>The word hung there, deliberate and poisonous. </p><p> </p><p>Rio punctuated the insult with a kiss pressed to the corner of Agatha’s mouth like a signature. Then lingered there, just long enough to make sure Agatha leaned into before whispering in her ear:</p><p> </p><p>“Klepto.”</p><p> </p><p>Then she was gone. Door shut. Tapped the window like some kind of post heist flourish. A thief of breath and reason and time. Confident as ever.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat motionless behind the wheel, mouth slightly parted, eyes locked on Rio’s ass in the side mirror until it disappeared from view.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck,” she muttered to herself.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced at the passenger seat. Half the picture frame had slid out of her bag. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the new photo. Not the fresh one Rio had clearly just added to the shelf- an obviously replaced snapshot from game night at Jen and Alice’s rental house from years ago. That one had been carefully placed, practically staged, so conspicuous in its positioning that Agatha hadn’t dared touch it. She knew Rio well enough to recognize bait when she saw it. That frame hadn’t lived in the apartment long enough to gather dust. It was too new, too self aware, too obviously asking to be taken.</p><p> </p><p>And if Rio expected her to take it… if she’d left it out like some sort of offering? Then Agatha couldn’t possibly accept it. That would make it a gift, and Agatha had never stolen anything freely given. She had principles. Or pride. Or maybe just spite.</p><p> </p><p>So, instead, Agatha had taken the other one.</p><p> </p><p>The one Rio wouldn’t expect her to go for.</p><p> </p><p>Just the two of them, curled up on that rusted fire escape with their cheeks squished together. That photo had lived in Rio’s apartment long enough to matter. It had survived different eras. Different silences. Different versions of themselves.</p><p> </p><p>And that, as far as Agatha was concerned, made it fair game.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, it also made it personal.</p><p> </p><p>Which is exactly why she took it.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio had baited her. And Agatha, naturally, had refused to bite. She had standards. Which is why she responded with equal pettiness and more precision. She didn’t steal what Rio wanted her to steal. She stole the thing Rio would actually miss.</p><p> </p><p>That felt earned.</p><p> </p><p>And fine, maybe she hadn’t thought about her history with petty theft in years. It had never come up in conversation, mostly because she had never needed to explain it. Not to Rio. Certainly not to herself. But that didn’t mean the impulse had disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>It had always been specific. She didn’t have sticky fingers in general- just when it came to Rio’s things. It started as a joke. A spoon gone missing. Then another. Rio had exactly four of silverware, and Agatha made it a point to disrupt the symmetry. Eventually it became a habit. A sweatshirt. A hoodie. A paperback. A pen. Trinkets. Lots of trinkets. </p><p> </p><p>Then two full boxes of Rio’s stuff never made it to Chicago, not by accident. One last sweatshirt survived the culling, and even that, eventually, had disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t about sentiment. Not entirely. It was about the comfort of possession. The power of keeping a piece of someone without having to ask.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at the frame a moment longer, then shoved it deeper into her bag and adjusted the mirror like it might help her regain composure. It didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her head fall back against the headrest.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s never letting that go,” Agatha muttered under her breath, voice flat.</p><p> </p><p>Another beat.</p><p> </p><p>“God, I hate her.”</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t true. Not remotely.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha still wasn’t giving the picture back.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha woke to a low, mechanical sound that took several seconds to register. It wasn’t a car. It wasn’t the AC kicking on. It was steadier than that, with the rough churn of something deliberately cutting through resistance. She turned over and groaned into her pillow, hoping she could drown out the sound. </p><p> </p><p>It persisted. </p><p> </p><p>Fully awake now, her brain pieced it together with increasing dread. A lawn mower. Not distant. Not someone else's problem. It was coming from her own yard.</p><p> </p><p>She reached for the clock on her nightstand and squinted. <em> 7:34. </em> On a Wednesday. Which ruled out Lucas, the neighbor kid, who should have been putting on his sneakers for school, not mowing her fucking lawn. Which meant-</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Oh no. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had made good on her promise.</p><p> </p><p>After one very long exhale, Agatha pushed herself upright, threw her comforter back, and trudged toward the window. She yanked her blackout curtains open and peeled apart the blinds.</p><p> </p><p>There she was.</p><p> </p><p>Not in some lazy excuse for yard work attire. Rio didn’t do anything half ass. She wore brown duck bib overalls, already streaked green at the knees. A black tank top was tucked beneath them, high at the neckline and sleeveless, showing dirt smudged arms. Her boots were scuffed, her hair was pulled back in a low bun, and her earbuds were tucked neatly in place. Every inch of her posture radiated focus. She pushed the mower with even, deliberate rows, pausing to turn only when the geometry demanded it.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Her gaze drifted toward the curb. Rio’s 4Runner was parked alongside the sidewalk with a full size U-Haul open trailer hitched to it. On it, everything was packed with purpose: gardening tools, a neatly rolled tarp secured with clips, several bags of soil stacked evenly, and a full flat of nursery plants arranged by height. Even edging stones had been strapped into place with bungee cords. A clipboard propped against the back tire of the trailer, probably covered in notes and underlines and god knows what else.</p><p> </p><p>Of course Rio brought a U-Haul. God forbid she show up to flirt without honoring at least one lesbian stereotype.</p><p> </p><p>Of course Rio brought a fucking clipboard. </p><p> </p><p>Of course Rio showed up to her fucking house trying to make Agatha forget that she was in the middle of a seventeen year long slow burn powered exclusively by emotional repression, catastrophic timing, and spite.</p><p> </p><p>And now Rio was out there being soft and stupid and useful, like that would fix it.</p><p> </p><p>It was excessive. It was overthought. It was thorough in a way that couldn’t be passed off as impulsive.</p><p> </p><p>It was perfectly Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood there, silent, unwilling to admit how attractive it was to watch someone do something well. She watched as Rio continued mowing with precision, not stopping to stretch or check her phone. She didn’t glance up. Didn’t acknowledge Agatha’s house. Her jaw was tight, her brows drawn, her pace unwavering.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, then muttered under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>“Well. Fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>This was not a quick favor. This wasn’t a twenty minute trip with a borrowed mower. This was a full scale project, an entire day of Rio Vidal applying manual labor to every corner of Agatha’s neglected yard. A renovation plan. An execution. A statement made through soil and sweat and painfully competent hands.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha would be forced to witness it. Every hour. Every choice. Every quiet act of order being imposed on a space Agatha had long since stopped believing deserved care.</p><p> </p><p>And the worst part was how clear it already was that Rio hadn’t done this out of compulsion or obligation. She had planned it. She had sourced it. She had chosen every item with intention and brought it here.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>By mid morning, the mowing had stopped. Rio wheeled the mower back into the trailer and pulled out the weed whacker. She started it without fuss and worked her way along the sidewalk. She paused only once, her back to the house to pull out her phone. It took her all of five seconds before the thing disappeared back into her pocket and the weed whacker started humming again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed against the side of her coffee mug she was holding.</p><p> </p><p>She let the blind fall back into place. Set the mug down and unlocked her phone.</p><p> </p><p>A photo. The top half of Rio’s face, clear plastic safety glasses smudged with dirt, her eyes squinted from the brightness of the sun.  A sliver of sky above her. And behind her, just visible in the background, the front of her house and the unmistakably lifted blind in the window where Agatha had been watching.</p><p> </p><p>The message underneath:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio: come say hi, friend. maybe toss in a kiss if you’re feeling generous... i hear friends do that now👀 </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at it. Then at the window. Then back at the screen.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t respond.</p><p> </p><p>She also didn’t throw the phone across the room, which felt, under the circumstances, like a remarkable act of restraint.</p><p> </p><p>What Agatha did do, however, was throw herself back into bed and open her Ring app. The front yard camera came up immediately- installed by Alice when Agatha moved it. </p><p> </p><p>There she was. </p><p> </p><p>Rio. Weed whacking. Hair pulled up, biceps flexing just enough to piss Agatha off, and wearing brown overalls and safety glasses that had no business being that fucking attractive.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched in silence. Not lurking, exactly. Just… observing. Just using what was available to her.</p><p> </p><p>She zoomed in.</p><p> </p><p>Just a little.</p><p> </p><p>Then closed the app and dropped her phone on the bed next to her.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t going down there. That would be encouragement.</p><p> </p><p>Let Rio work. Let her sweat. Let her wonder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha would stay exactly where she was.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>By the time noon rolled around, the noises outside had stopped, and Agatha peeled herself off the couch to check the window.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t alone anymore. Parked in front of her car was the ugliest thing Agatha had ever seen, a faded yellow 1978 Subaru Brat. It used to belong to Lilia, and as far as Agatha knew, it hadn’t run in years. Rio had talked about fixing it up once, and evidently she had, because now Sage seemed to be the one driving it. The two of them were perched on the open tailgate, legs swinging, sharing a greasy paper bag of food and absolutely zero decorum.</p><p> </p><p>Sage chucked a fry at Rio’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. She just reached over and dragged a greasy hand down the front of Sage’s face.</p><p> </p><p>Sage recoiled in horror. Rio laughed maniacally.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Because apparently this was normal. Apparently it had been, for a long time.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had missed it.</p><p> </p><p>Not just Sage. Not just the story of how she fit into Rio’s life. But <em> this </em>. This new version of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent years knowing Rio in the most specific way a person could know someone else. Reading the silences. Interpreting what was withheld. They’d built an entire friendship on implication and unsaid things. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had always been a fortress, and Agatha, somehow, had been the only one ever allowed past the gates.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t realized how much she’d clung to that fact. How much she’d built her idea of Rio around it.</p><p> </p><p>And now, from across a window, she was watching a different version entirely. One that laughed without restraint. One that let herself be messy. Affectionate. Known.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t imagined Rio like that.</p><p> </p><p>And she hadn’t been there to see the change, hadn’t been invited into the process of it. No warning. No bridge. Just a new Rio, fully formed, sitting where the old one used to be.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the curtain fall, slowly. Then stood there for a moment longer, unsure what to do with the heat crawling under her skin.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t jealousy. She didn’t want what Sage had… obviously.</p><p> </p><p>She just hated that it had happened without her. That Rio had crossed some invisible threshold, became someone more whole, more open and Agatha, who had once been the closest person to her in the world, hadn’t even been a footnote in that transformation.</p><p> </p><p>That absence felt louder than anything.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Thirty minutes later, Sage was gone. Rio stood alone, leaned back against her trailer, one boot crossed over the other as she looked over whatever was attached to that stupid clipboard. A cigarette burned between her fingers. She looked focused -annoyingly so- and entirely at ease.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her from the peephole for longer than she’d admit. The unopened water bottle in her hand was sweating, slipping slightly against her palm. She took a breath that didn't do anything, then opened the door and stepped outside.</p><p> </p><p>Then she opened the door and walked toward her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced up, her expression unreadable except for the faint twitch at the corner of her mouth, a smile she clearly wasn’t giving Agatha the satisfaction of seeing. Her eyes dropped back to the clipboard, mouth pursed.</p><p> </p><p>Once she was close enough, Agatha reached for the cigarette in Rio’s hand and took it without asking, placing the water bottle directly on top of the clipboard in a gesture that was neither generous nor polite.</p><p> </p><p>A mason jar sat on the trailer beside Rio, half filled with sand and already hosting a few used cigarette butts.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a drag and leaned against the trailer beside her, mirroring Rio’s position without thinking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, unfazed, set both clipboard and water bottle on the edge of the trailer behind her. Then she reached into the chest pocket of her overalls and pulled out a single cigarette. She slid it between her lips, crouched to rifle through one of the lower leg pockets, and came back with Agatha’s purple Zippo.</p><p> </p><p>While Rio lit the cigarette, she mumbled around it, “Fired your neighbor’s kid this morning,” she said. “Figured you’d want that handled.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed. “And how did he take that?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pocketed the lighter and took a slow drag, nodding.  “Great. Said you were terrifying. Claimed you were lowballing him for, and I quote, ‘the disastrous monstrosity that is your yard.’” She exhaled slowly, aiming the smoke up and away through a grin she didn’t bother hiding this time. </p><p> </p><p>Then Rio turned to face her fully, shifting her stance so she was squared toward Agatha now, shoulder brushing the trailer, the mason jar sitting between them on the ledge.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “That right?”</p><p> </p><p>“He actually looked really heartbroken about it.” Rio said, immediately. She flicked ash off the end of her cigarette into the jar, adding, almost offhand, “I gave him a hundred bucks just to get out of my face.” She took another drag and muttered looking away from Agatha,  “And then I hissed at him.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barked a laugh. She tried to smother it behind her hand, but it was too late. It cracked straight through her irritation and landed somewhere in the middle of her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“He ran away so fast,” Rio said, smirking. “Made me feel less bad about firing him.”</p><p> </p><p>“You should feel bad,” Agatha shot back. “What if landscaping was his dream?”</p><p> </p><p>“Then I did him a favor. He’s objectively shit at it.”</p><p> </p><p>“He’s thirteen!”</p><p> </p><p>“And?” Rio asked, full offense. “Fuck that kid. He shouldn’t be out here mangling the lawn of an incredibly hot woman anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snorted, “You’re awful.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head slightly, exhaled smoke through her nose, and shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to stay annoyed. Really, she did. But then her eyes dropped, against her better judgment, and lingered. First to Rio’s throat, damp with sweat. Her collarbone. The curve of her shoulder. Grass clung to her forearms, and flecks of dirt stuck to the skin around her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth went dry. She blinked, once, slowly.</p><p> </p><p>By the time she looked back up, Rio was already grinning- wide and unbearable, her teeth too white against the sunburn starting to creep up her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away fast. “You’re disgusting.”</p><p> </p><p>“Huh,” Rio said, dragging on her cigarette. “I don’t think you actually believe that.”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t flatter yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t have to,” Rio said, blowing smoke off to the side. “You’re doing a great job of it for me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head, jaw tight, lips threatening to betray her again. “I hate you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I miss you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “That doesn’t even make sense.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio dropped her cigarette into the mason jar and crossed her arms. “Would you like me to be more specific?”</p><p> </p><p>She was baiting Agatha. Intentionally, unmistakably. And Agatha- Agatha walked right into it without meaning to.</p><p> </p><p>Because her eyes had already dropped to Rio’s mouth. Because her brain, already working against her, had filled in the blanks before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>“I miss your mouth,” Rio said, flat as fact. Her eyebrows lifted, daring a reaction. “Clear enough?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers twitched around the cigarette she wasn’t smoking. For every way Rio proved herself different now, Agatha still managed to find herself surprised by it. </p><p> </p><p>She looked away. Long enough to sound amused when she said, “Now, Rio... is that how friends talk to each other?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t miss a beat. “Do friends kiss each other?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sometimes.”</p><p> </p><p>“Great. Then as your best friend, I think we should kiss. Immediately.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at her, unimpressed. “Desperate?”</p><p> </p><p>“Painfully.”</p><p> </p><p>“Tragic,” Agatha said, dragging from the cigarette before dropping it into the mason jar. She gave Rio a mock pout, lips pushed out. “Guess you’ll have to suffer.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed through her nose, but Agatha was already walking past her, not bothering to wait for a response, cutting straight through the yard to the flower bed- still overgrown, still an eyesore, miserable and begging for attention.</p><p> </p><p>She crouched down and reached for the extra pair of gloves Rio had laid out earlier- set neatly on the edge of the tarp alongside a shovel, a hand trowel, and a wheelbarrow already half filled with cleared debris.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t turn around, but she felt Rio’s stare. The quiet. The question. She focused instead on the roots of her flowerbed, brittle with neglect, tangled too deep in soil that hadn't been touched in far too long.</p><p> </p><p>“You gonna keep moping or are we pulling weeds?” Agatha called out without turning around. </p><p> </p><p>There was no mention of what Rio had said the last time this bed came up. Agatha didn’t acknowledge what it meant that she was here now, in the dirt, doing it with her. Didn’t ask if Rio still believed something brighter could grow here, if she still thought pulling everything out meant there was a future worth planting. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t ask, because she didn’t want the answer. Not out loud.</p><p> </p><p>She just sank her hands into the soil and pretended it was about the weeds.</p><p> </p><p>Behind her, Rio blinked once, then pushed off the trailer.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Hours later, they were covered in sweat and dirt, forearms streaked with soil, backs aching.  The sun hadn’t budged, still hanging high overhead.  Rio had handled most of the heavy work- shoveling, hauling, carving out the shape of the bed like she already knew what it was supposed to become. Agatha had floated in and out, helping where she wanted, offering commentary more than effort. Rio never said a word about it. If anything, she seemed... content to let her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha asked once how much it all cost.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer. Didn’t crack a joke, didn’t look up, didn’t so much as blink. She just started pulling off the price tags. One after another, a finality that made it clear the conversation was over. </p><p> </p><p>The answer was already in front of Agatha, buried in every shovel mark, every row of plants, every quiet detail handled without fanfare. Rio hadn’t skimped. Not on the effort, not on the cost, not on the time it clearly took to make her yard feel new. </p><p> </p><p>Affection, in Agatha’s life, had always arrived in messier forms. Conditional. Performative. Loud enough to echo, yet never quite landing where it should. It came tangled in expectations, handed out in pieces, then held just out of reach. She’d learned to take what she was given and act like it was enough. Rio had been part of that once- no matter how gentle her hands seemed, showing up had always come with silence.</p><p> </p><p>Here Rio was. Stubborn in the heat, dragging new life into a flower bed that had nothing left in it. Keeping her word without fanfare. Holding to the promise she’d made- that it would be different this time. That <em> she </em> would be different. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t ask again. </p><p> </p><p>Now, Agatha sat beside Rio, arms resting loose over her knees, offering commentary no one had requested. </p><p> </p><p>“You’re planting them too close together,” Agatha said, eyes on the cluster of purple azaleas Rio was tucking into place.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, wrist deep in soil, didn’t look up. “No I’m not.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at her, then down at the neat, thoughtful curve Rio was shaping with the last few plants. The mulch had already been spread behind them, carefully kept clear of the stems. The soil was dark, well turned. Everything smelled green and damp and alive.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t comment on any of that.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she sniffed. “You should’ve gone with white.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio finally looked up and sat back on her heels. Her face was flushed from the sun, brow damp, but her voice stayed even. “You like purple.”</p><p> </p><p>“I like being difficult,” Agatha shrugged, eyes on the azalea. </p><p> </p><p>Rio peeled off a glove, wiped her wrist on her overalls, and pulled out her phone. “Nursery’s still open,” she said, checking the time. “I can go back and get white, if that’s what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“You serious?”</p><p> </p><p>“Why wouldn’t I be serious?” Rio asked, genuinely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a short breath, frustrated with herself more than anything. “Because it’s stupid.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused, not hurt, but clearly trying to understand. “It’s not stupid if it’s what you want.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know what I want!” Agatha snapped before she could stop herself.</p><p> </p><p>The silence that followed wasn’t awkward, just… weighted. Rio studied her, one glove still off, dirt smudged along her wrist.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said finally, with a nod. “Then we don’t have to decide anything right now.” She glanced back at the flower bed, then toward the curb. “We’ve still got a few left to plant. If you want to go look at something else before we do, we can. I’ll unhitch the trailer.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched as Rio peeled off her other glove. Then she stood, dusting her palms once before turning toward the trailer.</p><p> </p><p>It made Agatha irrationally annoyed.  Not because it was irritating. Because it wasn’t. Because Rio was calm, deliberate, patient in a way that didn’t demand anything in return.</p><p> </p><p>She made it three steps toward the trailer before Agatha spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t have to do that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped. Glanced back.</p><p> </p><p>“They’re fine.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned fully, one brow raised. “Fine?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. Just picked at the grass. “They’ll live.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’ll do better than that.” Rio walked back without waiting for a response and kneeled beside the next plant, hands bare now, moving with purpose. “But if you hate them tomorrow, we’ll rip them out and try again.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p> </p><p>A solid twenty minutes passed where neither of them said a word.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t helping. She wasn’t talking. She just sat there in the grass beside her, too aware of the space between them, of the way Rio hadn’t looked at her since kneeling down again, hadn’t so much as spared her a glance. And it shouldn’t have mattered. It shouldn’t have made her feel like this.</p><p> </p><p>She could feel the sun on her neck, could feel her own skin prickling from sitting still too long, but it wasn’t just the heat. It was how fine Rio seemed with all of it. It didn’t make any fucking sense, because Agatha had been the one to pull back and Rio had kept her hands to herself like a fucking saint. Rio had respected every boundary, every pause, every breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was about ready to pull her fucking hair out becuase she was sitting right here and Rio couldn’t even be bothered to look up from a fucking clump of dirt. She clenched her fists in the grass, swallowed the heat rising in her throat, and tried -genuinely tried- not to say something.</p><p> </p><p>The silence held too long.</p><p> </p><p>“I am literally sitting in the dirt with you!” Agatha shouted, cutting through it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s head jerked up, startled, and her hands stilled. Her eyes found Agatha’s, wide, but not in alarm. More like quiet, amused confusion and didn't quite understand why she was being yelled at. </p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Rio said after a second, the corner of her mouth twitching upward. “It’s hot.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mouth parted. She shut it again. Swallowed. “That’s not- You can’t-” She shook her head, exasperated. “You <em> cannot </em>just say shit like that.”</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p> </p><p>That -<em> that </em>- was the issue.</p><p> </p><p>Because there was no reason. None Agatha was willing to admit. Nothing she could say that wouldn’t sound like an accusation against herself. Because Rio was playing fair. Rio had played <em> only </em> fair. She had done everything right, said all the right things, pulled back when asked, waited, respected every unspoken rule.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, furious, not because Rio was doing anything wrong but because she wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe she’d been horny for weeks, maybe she hadn’t been able to scratch the itch no matter how many times she’d tried. Alone, unsatisfied, fingers aching with frustration. But it wasn’t like she could say, <em> I can’t get off anymore and I think it’s your fault. </em></p><p> </p><p>And really, it wasn’t just that. It was the proximity. The restraint. The sheer discipline of Rio’s hands as they disappeared into the soil instead of sliding over her skin.</p><p> </p><p>It was the silence. And the stillness. And the way Rio could make her feel like she was suffocating without ever raising her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s expression shifted, softening just enough to give Agatha whiplash. “Do you want me to stop?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she answered, with such disgusted immediacy it made Rio laugh.</p><p> </p><p>Then, without needing permission, Rio shifted forward on her knees until she was close enough that Agatha could feel the warmth of her, the stupid comfort of her, the presence that never asked to be let in but always managed to get there anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her eyes trained somewhere to the left, resolutely not looking at her. She didn’t want to see the ease in her face, the gentleness she hadn’t earned, the patience she hadn’t asked for but was now drowning in.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Still, Agatha didn’t look. </p><p> </p><p>Rio rested her dirty ass hand on Agatha’s bare leg- warm palm against sun warmed skin, fingers smudged with soil- and dragged her thumb over it like she had every right to. Agatha’s eyes dropped immediately, breath catching at the contact. Her tongue pressed hard into her cheek as she stared at the hand on her leg. And then, slow and begrudging, Agatha looked up.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s expression hadn’t changed. She was still just <em> there </em>, impossibly calm, maddeningly steady, as if the tension hanging between them wasn’t heavy enough to split the sky.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby.” Rio said, devastatingly honest. “Come on. Give me something to work with.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s entire nervous system short circuited under the weight of that single word, delivered casually, affectionately, as if Rio had been calling her that her whole life.</p><p> </p><p>Her mouth went dry. Her heart picked up like it had been waiting for permission. Her thighs tensed, and she hated how much she felt it in her chest, in her stomach, in the throb between her legs. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha absolutely fucking hated how much she wanted to lean in, to let that word slip inside her mouth and have it stay there.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t call me that,” she whispered, too late and too breathless to make it sound convincing. A flimsy attempt at control that neither of them believed.</p><p> </p><p>What Agatha meant: <em> Don’t stop. Don’t take it back. Don’t ever fucking call me anything else. </em></p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Gay, but whatever.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips curled, soft and smug, and she nodded like she understood exactly what Agatha hadn’t even said aloud.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Rio said simply.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glared at her, hating the fact that her body was still humming. Hating the fact that Rio hadn’t taken her hand back. </p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>“Seriously. Say that again and I’ll-”</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>“You’ll what?” Rio cut her off, eyes dark with challenge and something warmer underneath.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>“I’ll-” Agatha tried again, bluff crumbling mid sentence. “I’ll-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice dropped, perfectly timed. “Kiss me?”</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Couldn’t. Her eyes already fell to Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held still, heart pounding like she might actually die if it didn’t happen… but at the last second, Rio diverted, brushing past her cheek to murmur directly into her ear.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned. </p><p> </p><p>No control. No covering it. It left her throat before she could even think about stopping it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back with a satisfied little hum.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh.” Rio tilted her head, pretending to consider something, lips pressed like she was trying not to smile. Then she looked off for half a second, just long enough to sell the performance, before turning back and raising one idle finger in the air. “You know,” Rio said thoughtfully, “Pretty sure friends don’t react like that.” she shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>God. Okay. Fine. Agatha gets it. This is about the other day. She called them friends. Big fucking deal. Rio’s bruised pride, front and center. Was Agatha being an asshole? Yes. But was she being honest? Also yes. Because it’s too much. It’s always been too much. Even when they did nothing at all, it was still loud.</p><p> </p><p>And honestly? That was safer. Silence was safer.</p><p> </p><p>Because if Agatha called it what it felt like, if she let herself want what it was already turning into, and Rio walked away again?</p><p> </p><p>No. Absolutely not. She wouldn’t recover. She knows that. She knows exactly what that would do to her, and she’s not interested in bleeding out over a mistake twice.</p><p> </p><p>This has to stay small. Manageable. Contained.</p><p> </p><p>Safe.</p><p> </p><p>Even if that’s a lie.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha scoffed, crossing her arms. “Are you seriously pissed off about that? That’s what we are, Rio. Friends.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged a little and kept hand exactly where it was on Agatha’s leg, thumb brushing up and down like a fucking counterargument.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, she said, “If calling this casual, if calling <em> us </em>friends, makes it easier for you to live in that terrifying genius brain of yours, go for it. Call it whatever you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. Didn’t raise her voice. But Agatha caught the barely there change in her posture, her breath, the way she stopped making eye contact halfway through the sentence.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not asking for a label.” she went on, quieter now. “ I just want you to kiss me when you want to. Without dissecting it to death before the impulse even makes it to your mouth.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly through her nose, jaw tight.</p><p> </p><p>“Just…” Rio’s voice softened again. “Stop lobotomizing yourself every time you look at me.”</p><p> </p><p>What the hell was Agatha supposed to say that?</p><p> </p><p>Rio had dropped it so casually, as if it wasn’t the most accurate insult she’d ever recieved. Like Rio had been watching her do it this whole time and was finally tired of pretending not to notice.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared out across her lawn, at nothing in particular. Anything but Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t angry. If she were angry, she’d know what to do. She could roll her eyes, say something cruel and clever, get up and walk inside. But this wasn’t anger. It was something quieter and more dangerous. Something with a pulse of its own.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re so different now,” Agatha said quietly. It wasn’t a compliment. Or maybe it was. She didn’t know. It just came out and she hated that it sounded a little like awe.</p><p> </p><p>“Good.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for the strap of Rio’s overalls and gave it a small tug. It was barely an indication, more a reflex than a decision. And still, Rio came willingly with the certainty of someone who had always known where they belonged and was done being quiet about it. </p><p> </p><p>Their mouths met in a soft collision with teeth grazing, lips parting on instinct. The type of kiss that didn’t ask for permission or pretend to be anything less than what it was- undeniable, rooted, exact. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t clumsy or rushed. It fit. Rio’s lips moved with a steadiness that made Agatha’s spine tense and her chest loosen all at once.</p><p> </p><p>She broke it first. Let her forehead rest against Rio’s, eyes shut, breathing uneven. Rio smelled of cut grass and sun drenched flowers, of dirt and open air, and somehow clean. Nothing harsh. Nothing artificial. Just real, and unfairly good.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled and shoved her back with a hand to her chest. “You stink,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, smiling with another victory that made Agatha want to ruin her.</p><p> </p><p>That was her cue to leave. She stood without a word and went inside to shower and glare at the stupid fucking eucalyptus still hanging in there, like it had any right to remind her of Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>As if she needed one.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was never getting out.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed in the shower for nearly an hour, letting the water scald her skin while she tried to scrub the noise out of her head. The water was too hot, but she didn’t turn it down. Maybe Rio was right. And Agatha was too tired to fight it, too tired to think, even though every part of her still screamed to run in the opposite direction of Rio Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally stepped out, she blow-dried and brushed her hair until it stopped looking feral. Then she pulled on pajamas. A white tanktop with the word <em> dyke </em> written in tiny red cursive across the chest, and a pair of white and red plaid boxers.</p><p> </p><p>By the time she peeked out the window, the sun had dipped low, casting soft gold across her freshly cleaned yard. It looked amazing. Peaceful. And very empty. No obnoxious x-ray tech.</p><p> </p><p>She stood there a moment longer, then grabbed her phone off the bed.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha: I’m hungry. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Thirty minutes later, the doorbell rang.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t think about it. She didn’t analyze it. Didn’t rehearse what she’d say or check her reflection or brace herself for whatever version of who might be standing on the other side.</p><p> </p><p>She just got up. Walked barefoot to the foyer and opened the door.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood on her porch in gray shorts and a navy sweatshirt, her hair still damp from a recent shower. She held two pizza boxes in one hand, a six pack of Dos Equis tucked under her arm.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know,” Rio said, as if they were already in the middle of a conversation, “that it’s a universally acknowledged truth that a night shift nurse cannot be good at her job and have a healthy personal life at the same time?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled before she could stop herself.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Rio Vidal was a simp for Agatha Harkness.<br /> </p><p> </p><p>And that was one thing Agatha never had to pretend not to love.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They ate on the floor, backs to the couch, knees pulled up, feet half tucked beneath the edge of the coffee table. Two boxes spread open between them, steam rising slowly in the dim light- one properly respectable, the other still catching flack for the pineapple. It had become a recurring bit, an argument without stakes, and neither of them felt like stopping it. Agatha chewed slowly, unfazed. Rio gestured dramatically with her crust, appalled. </p><p> </p><p>The air had cooled slightly since sunset, enough to raise goosebumps where skin met skin, but neither of them suggested a blanket. The television hummed in the background, some menu screen flickering, long ignored.</p><p> </p><p>After clearing off the coffee table, Rio’s hand landed on Agatha’s thigh.  Not with any intention. Just placement. The most natural place for it to land.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t cower. She didn’t even look at it. Her own hand found it without effort, covering the back of it loosely, her thumb tapping once against a knuckle before going still.</p><p> </p><p>They stayed like that while Rio pulled up a YouTuber she liked- some fast talking game streamer with a chaotic editing style and absolutely no chill. Her whole thing seemed to be screaming about terrible pull rates while opening blind boxes and somehow always getting the one she hated. Agatha had no real interest in it, but the chick was funny in a way that felt oddly specific, and it was something Rio was into. So she watched it. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, they made their way onto the couch. Agatha claimed her usual spot- the corner of the L-shaped sectional, where the cushions dipped because her ass had sat there so much, the shape practically molded to her. </p><p> </p><p>When Rio moved to take her place on the cushion beside her, Agatha caught her wrist and gave a small, silent nod toward the open space between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t question it. Just grinned, muttered something smug under her breath, and grabbed a pillow on her way down. She adjusted it over Agatha’s thighs, shifted until her head was in place, and sprawled out.</p><p> </p><p>She let her hand drop into Rio’s hair. Ran her fingers through it without paying much attention, just because she could. Rio flipped through options and eventually landed on <em> Practical Magic </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t mind.</p><p> </p><p>Not the closeness. Not the movie.</p><p> </p><p>Not any of it.</p><p> </p><p>Not when they were halfway through the movie and Rio turned her face slightly, cheek pressing deeper against her thigh. Not even when Rio brushed her nose along the inside of it.</p><p> </p><p>The contact was fleeting, accidental. But it sent a rush of goosebumps across Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>She felt the way Rio went still. The way she stopped breathing for a second, like she’d crossed a line she hadn’t meant to. Agatha could feel her start to pull away, already retreating before she could say anything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught the side of Rio’s jaw with a single finger. She pressed gently, guiding Rio back without a word.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Come back. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She hoped that was enough. Enough to say she wasn’t upset. That she didn’t need an apology. That she didn’t want Rio to move.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha’s brain chose to turn on her later then so fucking be it.</p><p> </p><p>She had survived worse than her own thoughts. She’d learned how to breathe through guilt. How to keep moving even when her brain was tearing itself apart for sport. She knew how to classify the damage, how to flatten it into something clinical, containable, distant.</p><p> </p><p>She would deal with it. She always did.</p><p> </p><p>But right now, none of that mattered. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent the better part of seventeen years trying not to think about this- and failing, every time. Lately, she hadn’t even been able to get herself off. Not for lack of trying, not for lack of effort, but because her hands, her toys, all of it had become useless. Inadequate. Nothing was enough. Not when her body had narrowed itself down to one person, one body, one impossibly specific absence. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t just desire anymore- it was refusal. The ache in her had grown smart, insistent. It knew what it wanted. And it was done pretending to settle for anything else.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled against her, the warmth of it spreading against Agatha’s skin. She could feel Rio waiting, breath steady, lips hovering close.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>Agatha used her left hand to brush her thumb against the edge of Rio’s jaw. Her right hand remained tangled in Rio’s hair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted just enough to drag the bridge of her nose along Agatha’s skin again. Rio stayed where she was after that, face turned into the inside of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her hand drift, her fingers threading through the strands of Rio’s hair again. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips grazed the inside of her thigh like a question. Agatha let her legs fall open a little wider in answer.</p><p> </p><p>And when Rio pressed a kiss there. Agatha’s fingers curled gently in her hair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed her lips into it again, then again. One kiss. Then another, softer. The third, open mouthed, lingered- heat and breath and the unmistakable slide of tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's breath caught and her hips jolted. </p><p> </p><p>She’d been resting there, sprawled between Agatha’s thighs, head turned lazily into her skin. She watched Rio readjust until she was kneeling between her legs. Rio’s hand reached for the pillow she’d set there earlier and pulled it out of the way, dropping it to the floor without a sound.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands skimmed the outside of Agatha’s thighs, thumbs pressing in, tracing the curve of muscle and soft skin.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio leaned in and kissed just above the waistband of Agatha’s boxers- open mouthed, slow. Her tank top had ridden up, exposing a strip of bare skin along her stomach, and Rio’s tongue dragged up it deliberately, leaving a slick line of heat in its wake.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hooked her fingers into the waistband and looked up. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her hips. Rio smiled and pulled the boxers down- teasingly slow. She bent her knees without being asked, feet flat against the couch, thighs falling open for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio eased down until she was stretched out on her stomach between Agatha’s legs. Her hands slid beneath her thighs, wrapping around them to grip her hips, anchoring Agatha there.</p><p> </p><p>The position sent a jolt straight through Agatha- how natural it felt, how easy it was to let Rio have her like this.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Rio whispered, voice catching. “You’re so wet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands flew into Rio’s hair before she could stop herself.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers flexed against Agatha’s hips. She pressed her forehead gently to the inside of Agatha’s thigh, trying to catch her breath, and then she whined against Agatha’s skin, soft and desperate, “Please, Agatha… let me taste you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head dropped back against the couch and a moan tore out of her before she could stop it. </p><p> </p><p>Her legs trembled around Rio’s shoulders, and she felt heat rush to her face. She exhaled, slow and shaky, the desperation in Rio’s voice had punched the air right out of her.</p><p> </p><p>Every time Agatha thought she had heard the worst of it, the part that might finally break her completely, Rio found a new way to speak. A new voice, a new angle, a new version of herself that made Agatha ache with want and something else entirely. Devotion, maybe. Hunger, certainly. </p><p> </p><p>A sound Agatha heard once and knew she would spend the rest of her life chasing.</p><p> </p><p><em> ‘Seventeen years,’ </em> Agatha’s thoughts murmured. ‘ <em> Seventeen years spent waiting for Rio to say your name like that.’ </em>And her heart -far less reasonable, far more cruel- pleaded with every beat to keep it sacred. Keep it hers. Let no one else ever speak it that way. Let it belong only to Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down, chest heaving, eyes dark. “God,” she gasped, voice shaking. “Yes. I want it- I want you.”</p><p> </p><p>The last word cracked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved the second she heard it. Her mouth was on Agatha in an instant. </p><p> </p><p>Flat tongue, full contact up the entire length of her slit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned, her head slammed back against the cushion. Her thighs twitched hard against Rio’s shoulders, her heels digging into the couch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned into her, arms tightening around her thighs, dragging her closer, locking her in place. Her tongue flattened and dragged again, then circled her clit and when Agatha whimpered, Rio did it harder.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck- Rio- ”</p><p> </p><p>Rio dragged her tongue down and pushed inside of Agatha. Agatha’s legs clamped around her head, breath coming in short, shallow gasps. Agatha was soaked. She could hear it. Feel it. The mess of it. The want of it.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled out just enough to lick up everything she’d coaxed out of Agatha, then pressed a kiss directly to her clit again, tongue swirling, relentless.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands were in Rio’s hair, her grip tightening as her hips rolled up into Rio’s mouth, chasing every stroke.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved one hand away from her hip, dragged it down between them, and slid two fingers through the mess she’d made of Agatha. She pressed inside in one slow, steady push, sinking into her knuckles. Her mouth sealed around Agatha’s clit, tongue moving in hard, quick circles while her fingers fucked Agatha- deep and relentless, every thrust matched to the movement of Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha choked on a cry. “Don’t stop,” she gasped, voice cracking. “Rio, please- don’t fucking stop-”</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned like she was about to come just from hearing Agatha say that. Her fingers curled inside, again and again, hitting the spot that made Agatha see stars.</p><p> </p><p>The sound of Rio fucking her was obscene. Wet, fast, unrelenting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s orgasm ripped through her, violent and sudden, her whole body seizing, thighs crushing Rio’s head, mouth open on a broken scream. Her hands tightened in Rio’s hair, pulling hard, but Rio didn’t stop- she kept licking, kept fucking her, drawing it out, making her ride it all the way through.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slowly eased her fingers out, careful, her touch gentler now. She pressed a kiss to the inside of Agatha’s thigh. Then another, higher up. Then finally pulled back, sitting back on her knees.</p><p> </p><p>Everything was too much. Agatha’s pulse throbbed in her ears. Her skin was flushed and damp, her legs sticky and trembling, her mouth dry.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped her head forward. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s lips were parted, breath coming in shallow, her hair stuck to her face. Her cheeks flushed, mouth wet, pupils blown so wide they barely looked human.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart kicked harder in her chest. Her thighs twitched where they still rested open. She reached out and dragged her thumb slowly across Rio’s bottom lip, wiping through slick wetness.</p><p> </p><p>The second Agatha’s thumb dragged across her lips, Rio whimpered- soft and broken, barely audible. Her mouth parted further under the touch, breath stuttering out of her in a shaky exhale, and her lashes fluttered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s whole body was tense with restraint, but her mouth was open, wanting, and helpless under Agatha’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>She looked up at Agatha like she was waiting to be told she was allowed to keep breathing.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha whispered. “Look at you." She swallowed hard. Her thumb stayed at Rio’s mouth, but her hand trembled. She needed to feel Rio. Needed her closer.</p><p> </p><p>“Come here, please.” Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p> </p><p>She moved and climbed into Agatha’s lap, legs sliding around her, knees pressed into the cushions on either side. Her thighs bracketed Agatha’s hips, and she settled over her without a word, without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her hands and cradled Agatha’s face. Her thumbs brushed along her jaw, her fingers resting just beneath her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut for a second, overwhelmed by the intimacy of it- the weight of Rio in her lap, the warmth of her hands, the way Rio looked at her like she wasn’t sure if this was real.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha opened her eyes again, Rio was still staring.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed, her voice laced with need.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s response escaped in a humiliating squeak, too high, too soft to take back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s forehead dropped to hers. Their noses touched.</p><p> </p><p>“Kiss me,” Rio whispered, pleading threaded through every syllable.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for Rio’s wrists, where they still cradled her face, and held them. Then she tilted her head just enough to let her nose skim the curve of Rio’s cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth parted in waiting.</p><p> </p><p>The first kiss she gave Rio was small. Just a brush of mouths. Agatha pulled back just enough to breathe, then went back in before Rio could chase her.</p><p> </p><p>The second kiss was intentional.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha parted her lips and fit herself to Rio’s mouth. Her fingers threaded into the hair at the nape of Rio’s neck, holding her steady as Agatha tilted her head and deepened the kiss. Her tongue slid against Rio’s, unhurried, coaxing, and that was when Agatha tasted herself.</p><p> </p><p>She tasted herself on Rio’s mouth, and something in her burned at the filthy intimacy of it. It made Agatha groan.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed every trace she’d left behind. Needed to burn it into her mouth so she’d never forget what Rio tasted like with Agatha on her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her back with no hesitation. Her hands tightened at Agatha’s jaw, nails biting into skin, mouth opening wider like she didn’t want to miss a second of it. She moaned into Agatha’s mouth -high, needy, broken- and Agatha swallowed it down like a reward.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands slid from Agatha’s jaw to her shoulders, fingers toying with the straps of her tank top. She traced the dip of the neckline, unsteady and slow, following the edge where skin met fabric. Then lower, down to the hem, where her fingertips slipped just beneath, a silent question trembling against Agatha’s stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha answered without a word. She pulled back just enough to let Rio lift the shirt over her head and toss it aside.</p><p> </p><p>The second it hit the floor, Agatha leaned in for another kiss, but Rio caught her with flat palm against her chest. She eased Agatha back into the couch cushions.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brown eyes were wide, hungry, almost pained as they dragged over every inch of Agatha’s bare skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let Rio stare. Let her linger, drink her in, fall apart over her. There was power in watching Rio tremble just from the sight of her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart was pounding beneath Rio’s palm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked once and swallowed hard. She shook her head like she was trying to reset herself. She whispered, “You’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped up to Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>The room stilled, or maybe time did. For a breath, all she could hear was the rush of blood in her ears.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look away. Didn’t smirk. Didn’t soften the blow of what she’d said with a joke, the way she used to when things got too real. She just sat there like she meant it. Like she hadn’t just ripped the air from Agatha’s lungs with a single sentence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to say something, but there was nothing clever waiting on her tongue. Only the echo of Rio’s words and the ache in her chest that said: <em> This is dangerous. </em></p><p> </p><p>So instead Agatha said, quiet and far too honest, “You can’t say things like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze moved to the place where her hand rested, fingers spread over Agatha’s chest.</p><p> </p><p>Her thumb moved once, slow.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve swallowed that sentence more times than I can count.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to throw up. Not really. Not at all, actually.</p><p> </p><p>She just couldn’t think about what it meant. Not right now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still in her lap, still in her stupid shorts, legs warm and bare against her own. That was something. Something to look at.</p><p> </p><p>It helped. Not much.</p><p> </p><p>Because if she let herself think too long she’d open her mouth and everything would come out. All of it. The years. The feelings. The truth she had buried so deep it started to feel like fiction.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha couldn’t afford that.</p><p> </p><p>Because the moment she spoke, it would stop being about want and start being about everything else.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t push.</p><p> </p><p>She let Agatha kiss her. Let her pretend the silence was choice and not fear. Her hand stayed exactly where it was, still resting over the beat of Agatha’s heart.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed the corner of her jaw, then her cheek. She thought if she stayed close enough, if she stayed busy enough, maybe that sentence would stop echoing in her head.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her sweatshirt herself and pulled it over her head, slow enough that Agatha had to watch. Had to see every inch of Rio revealed like a confession.</p><p> </p><p>The fabric slipped up and over, baring skin inch by inch- first the soft curve of her stomach, then the line beneath her ribs, then-</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha rasped, her hands gripping Rio’s thighs, squeezing hard enough to make her gasp.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let the shirt fall to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands slid upward until her palms rested just beneath Rio’s ribs. She leaned in and pressed her mouth to her collarbone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. Her hands gripped Agatha’s shoulders, pulling her closer, and their chests touched. The sudden contact made them both gasp.</p><p> </p><p>Years of silence collapsed in that breathless press of skin, in the ache of what they could’ve had and never did.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back enough to kiss lower, took Rio’s nipple into her mouth and sucked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned and her whole body arched in response. Her hands flew to Agatha’s hair, holding her there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t stop. She licked, then sucked again, rougher this time, until Rio whimpered. Then she moved, dragging her mouth across Rio’s chest and pressing a kiss just above her heart.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted Rio to feel it later, when she was alone, when Agatha wasn’t there to do it again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips sealed around skin that pulsed beneath her, and she stayed there until the bruise bloomed under her tongue.</p><p> </p><p>She kissed it after, gently, then moved- trailing her mouth along the sharp line of Rio’s collarbone, up the side of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tipped her head back and let her, her fingers curling tightly in Agatha’s hair, pressing her closer with a shaky exhale that turned into a low, desperate whine.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha licked a line up Rio’s throat, then closed her mouth just below Rio’s jaw and sucked another mark into place. This one even darker. Possessive.</p><p> </p><p>When she pulled back, Rio was gasping, lips parted, throat flushed and bruised. Agatha’s hands slid down over Rio’s ribs, her waist, until they reached the waistband of her shorts. She moved  one hand on Rio’s thigh, the other sliding between them.</p><p> </p><p>She pressed her palm over the fabric, right where she knew Rio wanted her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body jerked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave her one slow grind of her hand, enough pressure to make her hips jolt again, then gripped the waistband of her shorts with both hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Take these off,” Agatha said, voice rough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her hips in Agatha’s lap, hands fumbling for the waistband.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha helped, dragging the shorts down her thighs, her fingers grazing skin as she worked them off and tossed them aside.</p><p> </p><p>Rio settled back into Agatha’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned in and pressed a kiss to the underside of her jaw. Then another, a little higher. She teased Rio, barely brushing her knuckles over the heat between Rio’s thighs. When Agatha finally touched Rio she fully cupped her and the sound Rio made wasn’t even human.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was soaked. Drenched. So fucking wet. </p><p> </p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha moaned, mouth right at Rio’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>“For you,” Rio said breathlessly. “It’s all for you.”</p><p> </p><p>The sound that tore from Agatha’s throat was guttural, half whine, half sob, ripped straight from her chest. Her head fell against Rio’s temple. She lined two fingers up, and pushed inside. Agatha groaned, her free hand grabbing at Rio’s back as her fingers sank fully in, knuckles deep. </p><p> </p><p>“You feel so good,” Rio whined into Agatha’s ear. “So fucking good. Please, don’t stop. Please.”  She rocked her hips harder now, fucking herself on Agatha’s hand. Rio’s thighs trembled around her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t. She couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio moaned.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her- messy, open mouthed, lips dragging across her cheek, her throat, her mouth. She could barely keep up. Not physically, her body knew exactly what to do. It was the rest of it. The sound of Rio moaning her name. The way Rio felt around her fingers- tight, wet, pulsing. The way Rio’s skin burned against hers.</p><p> </p><p>Her name came out of Rio again, low and hushed. “Agatha… baby.”</p><p> </p><p>It sounded so desperate Agatha almost stopped entirely because of the way it made something in her chest twist.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever Rio was holding in, it wasn’t meant to come out. Agatha felt that before she even heard the words.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you ever think about me while you were fucking her?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s body kept moving, her hand still buried deep inside the woman she hadn’t stopped wanting, but everything else -her mind, her heart, the tightness in her chest- froze.</p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio tense in her arms like she’d only just realized what she said. Her fingers dug into Agatha’s back in fear, probably bracing for the fallout.</p><p> </p><p>“I- ” Rio’s voice shook as she tried to take it back.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t let her. She brought her hand to the back of Rio’s head, fingers sliding into that familiar mess of hair. She tugged gently until Rio’s eyes met hers, brown and full of panic. And Agatha kissed her. Sloppy, breathless, desperate.</p><p> </p><p>Because she had. Not always. Never just in passing. Never just once. Agatha had thought about Rio in the places where regret thrived- when someone who loved the outline of her, but never really what lived inside it, when she stopped recognizing herself in the mirror and wondered if anyone else ever had. She had thought about what it would’ve felt like if they hadn’t been so careful. If one of them had just said something. Reached. Stayed.</p><p> </p><p>Lying would be a cruelty, and this truth felt like the only thing Agatha had left to offer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whispered against Rio’s mouth, “Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>The second the word left her mouth, Rio came hard around Agatha’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Her whole body seized, her breath tore out of her throat, and every muscle in her legs locked around Agatha’s hips. She buried her face in Agatha’s neck and held on, nails pressing into her shoulders.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moaned aloud, caught off guard by the sudden slick heat flooding her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still trembling, still pulsing around her, small aftershocks chasing each other through her body as she clung tighter to Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed where she was, fingers still inside, now slow and steady, guiding her through it.</p><p> </p><p>She kissed the side of Rio’s head, then her temple, then the corner of her mouth. No rush to move, no need to speak.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t lift her head. Her breath came in warm waves against Agatha’s throat.</p><p> </p><p>The question still echoed in Agatha’s mind. And the answer had already been written into every part of her body and soul:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> There had never been anyone else. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t let it linger. She didn’t want to think. Not right now. She didn’t want to hand this over to her unforgiving mind, let it turn it over and pick it apart until nothing soft was left.</p><p> </p><p>They sat there in silence. Agatha’s fingers still inside Rio. And Rio still curled into her neck, body warm, breath slowing against her skin. The worst of the aftershocks had passed, but neither of them moved.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio shifted her hips, just enough, and Agatha eased out of her slowly. Rio inhaled sharply at the loss.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back into the couch and reached behind her for the throw blanket. It took a little maneuvering with one arm still half wrapped around Rio, but she managed to drape it over both of them, even if it barely reached past their knees.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted, reaching down to fix the blanket. She unfolded it properly, adjusting the blanket until it covered them both. Then she stretched her legs out along the couch and settled back in, one arm draped across Agatha’s waist, her head tucked beneath her jaw.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you want some water?” Agatha asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head and pressed closer, mouth brushing against Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for the remote buried in the cushions and restarted <em> Practical Magic </em>. The opening credits rolled again. She didn’t expect them to watch it. But it gave her something to look at. Something to do with her eyes while Rio stayed pressed against her.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>They’d moved upstairs not long after the movie ended. Agatha blamed it on the- what? Afterglow? Temporary insanity? Some kind of blissed out, post orgasmic daze that made her forget how to pretend she didn’t want this exact outcome. That she hadn’t spent just three years short of half her life trying not to want it.</p><p> </p><p>No. Not quite… actually, it was much worse than that:</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> When the credits started to roll and Rio sat up, reaching for her shirt without saying a word, Agatha didn’t need to ask what she was doing. She saw it in the way Rio kept her head down, in the way her fingers brushed the fabric like she was stalling. It wasn’t guilt. It wasn’t shame. And it sure as hell wasn’t indifference- not after what they’d just done.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha wasn’t stupid. She knew exactly what this was. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Fear. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Quiet. Unmistakable. Deeply fucking sad. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It reminded Agatha of someone trying not to wake a house they didn’t think they belonged in. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> And it made her fucking sick. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Because Rio didn’t believe she was wanted. She was trying to leave before Agatha could ask her to. And maybe if Agatha had been in a different mood, with more distance between them and less truth in her mouth, she would’ve let her go. But it was insulting. Gentle in the worst way. An exit that assumed she wasn’t worth the mess. Pathetic in its silence. Infuriating in its certainty.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha all but barked at her.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “What are you doing?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Rio froze, her shirt curled in one fist. She didn’t look up. She didn’t speak right away. She just held still, like she was waiting for something to break.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “I didn’t want to assume,” Rio said finally. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> That was all. No accusation. No self pity. Just the most honest explanation Agatha could’ve imagined, and the most infuriating one. Because Rio had meant it. She wasn’t being coy. She’d already made peace with the idea that she wouldn’t be asked to stay. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha rolled her eyes, not because she was annoyed, but because the alternative was saying something that sounded too close to ‘please stay’. She wasn’t going to beg. She wasn’t going to soothe someone who’d spent months getting under her skin only to cower the second they got in. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> “Don’t be an idiot.” Agatha got up,  ass naked, and walked upstairs without waiting for a response. She didn’t check to see if Rio was behind her. She didn’t need to. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> But still, it sat wrong in her chest. Because if Rio hadn’t followed, Agatha would’ve let her walk away. That much she knew. And she would have never forgiven herself for it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> They made it up the stairs and to the hallway before something in Agatha froze. She stopped walking without realizing she had, and when she turned around, Rio nearly ran into her. For a moment, they just stared at each other. Rio opened her mouth, maybe to explain, maybe to apologize, but Agatha didn’t give her the chance. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha grabbed her by the face and kissed her- hard, uncoordinated, anything but graceful. Her hands moved without thought, dragging through Rio’s hair, pulling her closer until Agatha felt her back hit the wall. It wasn’t about control. It wasn’t about heat. It was the only way Agatha knew how to tell Rio that she was wanted here. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She wanted to erase the look on Rio’s face before it settled in too deep. That ridiculous, horrible look that said she hadn’t understood what any of this meant. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha kissed her as it was the only language she trusted. She didn’t care if it made sense. She didn’t care if it helped. She just couldn’t let Rio believe, even for a second, that it had been a mistake.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> And maybe it wouldn’t survive the morning. Maybe neither of them would know what to do with the sunlight.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Agatha had wanted Rio before, when neither of them said a word, and silence was the only thing they ever dared to share, in every version of Rio she’d never been brave enough to touch. She wanted Rio in the silence after, across years and cities and the life she built without her. She wanted her now, in whatever came next, in every future version of herself that still didn’t know how to say it out loud.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> She would always want Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Even if it wilted by daylight, even if she never learned how to keep it alive, Agatha would tend it through the dark- long enough to feel it bloom beneath her fingers, if only once. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She woke slowly. Sleep clung to the edges of her vision as she opened her eyes, then narrowed them against the light slipping past the curtain. It was soft and indifferent. Morning, probably. Maybe later. She didn’t check.</p><p> </p><p>Her body registered the heat before anything else. Skin overheated in a way that had nothing to do with the weather. She was too warm, too bare, and not alone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> It wasn’t a fucking dream. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still here, currently operating as Agatha’s personal furnace. Which, fine, wasn’t new. She’d always run hot.</p><p> </p><p>Years ago, when they were only what they allowed themselves to be, it was Rio’s legs- always on fire, always stretched across the mattress at impossible angles until they found Agatha in sleep. Or her back, warm and solid, pressed against Agatha’s without invitation.</p><p> </p><p>Some mornings, Agatha would wake to find her. A leg thrown over her hip. An arm slipped around her waist. Fingers curled in the fabric of a borrowed shirt like they’d never let go. Once, her back pressed flush to Rio’s chest, her nose tucked into the curve of Agatha’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>It never felt intentional. Not at first. But over time, Agatha noticed the pattern- how Rio always found her even in sleep. Always reached for her. Always stayed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha used to complain about it.</p><p> </p><p>But this.. <em>this</em> was different.</p><p> </p><p>This was the first time Agatha had woken up to Rio Vidal naked in her bed. Head tucked under Agatha’s chin. One thigh hooked over her own. A hand draped low on her stomach, thumb twitching occasionally, like even asleep, Rio couldn’t fully shut off.</p><p> </p><p>At some point they made it to Agatha’s bed last night, dragging each other across the sheets, too far gone to care what it looked like. It wasn’t gentle. It wasn’t rough. It just didn’t stop. It was messy. Wordless. Too much, and somehow not enough. They didn’t stop moving until Agatha couldn’t tell where her limbs ended and Rio’s began.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had assumed she’d wake up choking on reality. That she’d find Rio tangled around her and feel claustrophobic, suffocated by too much body heat and the implications of what they’d done. That some part of her would flinch and start pulling it apart until it resembled something she could leave behind without consequence.</p><p> </p><p>But that didn’t happen.</p><p> </p><p>There was no rush of shame. No scramble to break it. Just the weight of Rio against her, warm and steady, and the startling realization that she could still breathe. That her chest didn’t feel tight. That she didn’t want to move.</p><p> </p><p>For years, Agatha had told herself a story about other versions of this. Other universes, other lives where things were simpler. Where the timing was better. Where one of them had said something early enough to change the ending. She used to find comfort in the idea that somewhere out there, they got it right.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, that fantasy had begun to feel offensive. Condescending. As if there was a less fucked up, more deserving version of her who had earned the thing she couldn’t have. As if it was ever about deserving.</p><p> </p><p>She’d started to believe they were built to break- across every timeline, every life, every shape their story might’ve taken. That something in them would always buckle before it held. And somehow, that was easier. Easier than believing there was a world where they didn’t fall apart. Where it hadn’t been this hard. Where someone else got to keep what she could barely admit she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed still. Pressed her mouth to the crown of Rio’s head and let herself breathe.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Freely. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Because seventeen years into whatever twisted, diabolical form their friendship had taken, this felt, if not right, then less wrong. A small, improbable moment carved out of a timeline that had otherwise gotten everything backwards. And for once, she didn’t want to question it. Not yet. Not while it was still warm in her hands.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t naïve enough to think it would last. The universe, or whatever bored cosmic bastard with a sadistic sense of humor, had never let her get away with much, least of all this. And if she was being honest -which she wasn’t- she could admit it probably wasn’t the universe at all. But honesty didn’t serve her here. It never had. It was easier to call it bad timing, bad luck, bad design. Easier to believe the fault was structural rather than personal. That someone, somewhere, had rigged it from the start.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe the truth was: it had been Agatha all along. That she had written the rules. Changed them. Refused to play by them. She’d protected herself so well that she never had to admit she was the one laying down the pieces. Always pretending it was a game someone else started.</p><p> </p><p>And that was something she refused to look too closely at.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her palm flat against Rio’s back, let her thumb move in the smallest brush she could manage. A small act of proof. That she was here. That neither of them had left.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t care if it was temporary. She wasn’t interested in permanence or promises or whatever came next. Not when everything in her had finally gone quiet from the effort of trying not to ruin it. Not when Rio was still sleeping against her like this was safe. Like Agatha had ever known how to be that for someone.</p><p> </p><p>She could live inside this moment a little longer. Safe. Uncomplicated. Before the universe remembered who they were. Before she did.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers moved. Slid slowly, brushing up and down the length of Rio’s spine, lightly.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>In response, Rio pressed in closer, her nose brushing Agatha’s collarbone.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Finally.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held still. Pressed her mouth firmer into the crown of Rio’s head and didn’t breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Tension had settled across her body, but now it vibrated- electric in her toes, in her chest, between her ribs. Every molecule alert, buzzing, ready to misread.</p><p><br />Then-</p><p><br />Movement. Small. Intentional.</p><p> </p><p>A thumb brushed across a top her ribs. </p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand had stayed there all night, resting soft and possessive in the space between them, like even in sleep she’d been waiting for the moment Agatha might reach back. Her breathing was still steady. Not quite as deep as before.</p><p> </p><p>Her thumb brushed again, slower this time. Then her whole hand moved, skimming forward to the side of Agatha’s ribs. Palm flat. Warm. Testing.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t stay there. Instead, she dragged her hand back the way it came, retracing the curve of Agatha’s ribs, then forward again. And again.</p><p> </p><p>A pattern. A line drawn and redrawn across Agatha’s skin until it started to hum.</p><p> </p><p>And every time Rio’s hand swept down, she let it drift, inch by inch, closer to the soft of Agatha’s stomach. </p><p> </p><p>A silent question. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her body answer for herself, her hips rising just enough to tell Rio yes, this, again, now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t rush. Didn’t change her rhythm. Her hand kept moving in the same slow pattern, only now her thumb pressed deeper, dragging firmer with every pass. And Agatha could feel her heart hammer between her legs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth pressed into the side of her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered out too fast, her chest rising before she could stop it. The tension in her body rewired itself in a second, heat pulling upward into her jaw, her scalp, her spine.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed. Blinked hard. She wanted to stay still. To keep the anticipation suspended just a little longer.</p><p> </p><p>“You awake?” Agatha whispered, breath catching halfway out of her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>Which was generous, considering what she actually meant was: ‘<em> you better not fucking be asleep for this, because I swear to god…’ </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed into her skin.  Her hand dipped lower, found the edge of her hip, then slipped to the other, pressing flat, deliberate in answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand shot to the back of Rio’s head. She threaded her fingers through her hair and pulled, dragging her in, anchoring her there. Her body felt traitorous- tuned too tightly, wound so close to breaking that even the drag of air across her skin felt dangerous. She pressed her mouth and her nose into Rio’s hair, clinging to the scent like it could anchor her.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t graceful. It was reflex. A desperate attempt to stay grounded, to keep her body from arching up and chasing the friction of fucking nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Seventeen years. That’s all. No big deal.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was actually going to lose her fucking mind. </p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted against her grip, nudging her way upward, unfolding from where she’d been tucked beneath Agatha’s jaw. Her body was flush against Agatha’s side, eyes still puffy with sleep. The sleepiness of her face softened every line and made her unbearably beautiful. </p><p> </p><p>Her hand slid between Agatha’s legs, confidently. </p><p> </p><p>So Agatha opened her legs wider.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved again, up and over, situating herself between them. She leaned down until their foreheads touched. Until breath mingled between them. Until the silence was its own kind of homage.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had known their silences. She’d worn them like a second skin, tasted them in the back of her throat, bitter and metallic, made from all the things she never let herself say. They lived in the air between them. She’d felt them when Rio left a room, in glances that never lingered long enough, in every touch that almost happened and didn’t. </p><p> </p><p>Their love had always arrived through absence. It was never spoken, never claimed. Only endured.</p><p> </p><p>Love by omission.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her hand without thinking, touched Rio’s jaw with something too careful to be called want, too certain to be called fear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Slow. Unforgiving. Unfamiliar.</p><p> </p><p>Even now, there were parts of Rio Agatha had never touched. Not with her hands. Not with her mouth. Not with any part of herself willing to admit what this was.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, disgustingly reckless, learned them one kiss at a time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back. She didn’t say anything. Just shifted enough that she could see Agatha’s face, to let Agatha see hers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried not to look. She tried to fight it, to study the arch of Rio’s cheek or the line of her jaw or anything else that might soften the blow. But it was too late. She was already in it.</p><p> </p><p>She was already drowning in the brown of Rio’s eyes, already being pulled under.</p><p> </p><p>For the first time, they didn’t look away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand cupped her, full and firm, and rocked her hips into the pressure. She held there. Firm. Steady. Letting Agatha feel the weight of it. Then moved again- her other hand sliding beneath Agatha’s knee, guiding her leg up and around her waist, opening her further with an ease that felt insanely intimate.</p><p> </p><p>And briefly, Agatha thought, maybe they should just invest in a strap on together. Co-own it. Name it. Build a shrine. Skip the therapy. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to be fucking ruined.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio rocked her hips again, hand still pressing between her thighs, and Agatha’s head fell back against the pillow, a sharp gasp tearing loose from her throat.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t delicate. It wasn’t planned.</p><p> </p><p>It was the sound of a woman losing an argument with her own body.</p><p> </p><p>She gripped Rio’s ass, fingers flexing, trying to keep her close. Trying to chase friction, chase pressure, chase anything she could get her hands on.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t pretending anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Rio adjusted -still watching, still fucking watching- and finally slid two fingers inside of Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>A moan tore through Agatha, loud and sudden, and before she could stop it, Agatha’s eyes slammed shut. Her head snapped back, chin colliding with Rio’s. Above her, Rio grunted, steadying herself with one arm braced next to her head, the other still caught between them. Rio adjusted her position slightly and drove forward, harder this time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into Rio’s ass- possessive, frantic, almost cruel. She couldn’t help it. Every thrust forced a whimper from her throat, the sound guttural and breathless, barely recognizing the sounds falling from her own mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at me,” Rio begged under her breath, voice coming apart as it hit Agatha’s chin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did. Stupidly, desperately- she looked.</p><p> </p><p>And the way Rio looked at her tore through the last of her defenses.</p><p> </p><p>She was just there, stripped down and terrifyingly sure, and Agatha felt it land deep, right where she couldn’t afford it. And Agatha, who always needed a reason, suddenly couldn’t remember what she’d been fighting so hard to protect.</p><p> </p><p>Another moan broke loose from Agatha’s chest, louder this time, raw from the weight of being seen.</p><p> </p><p>“God, Agatha,” Rio whimpered, her voice rising, trembling. “You’re gonna make me- fuck, I can feel you.”</p><p> </p><p>All Agatha could do was hold on. She hadn’t realized until now that Rio was chasing it- grinding into her own hand, fucking into Agatha with growing urgency. Each movement deeper, rougher, more precise. Her hips snapped forward with intent, as if she knew exactly what Agatha would need and wouldn’t stop until she gave it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to scream. Wanted to sob. Wanted to pull her down and never let her leave.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio’s voice broke again- wrecked, desperate, pleading.</p><p> </p><p>“Say my name. Please. Just say it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did.</p><p> </p><p>It tore from her like a confession wrung from bone laid bare before the only force that had ever stood a chance of answering her the way she needed. The way no one else ever could.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said it again as if it were scripture. As if it were gospel. As if it were the name she was made to kneel before. A name she’d carried in the hollow of her chest for seventeen years, silent and sacred, hoping -one day- it would be safe to speak aloud.</p><p> </p><p>When she did, Rio came. Shaking, gasping, hers.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha followed. Undone, not by the force of it, but by what it meant to worship and be met.</p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the morning passed without urgency. Time didn’t stall. It just moved differently after. Slower. Warmer. A little too easy.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, they dozed off- barely an hour, not long enough for Agatha to stop feeling everything. She woke up warm and sore and unreasonably aware of the fact she HAD stayed curled into Rio’s side the entire time.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio slipped out of bed, Agatha didn’t follow. Didn’t look. Didn’t ask where she was going or what she needed. She wasn’t listening for answers. She stayed exactly where she was, sheets tangled at her waist, the air still thick with whatever was happening between them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wandered back into her bedroom barefoot, two mugs in hand, wearing nothing but Agatha’s old Westview U t-shirt, and not a trace of shame. Her tongue was tucked into her cheek as she glanced at the coffees, then back up at Agatha with a glint that said, '<em> look what I brought you.' </em>She walked in to Agatha's bedroom, looking entirely at home, and Agatha let her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio climbed onto the bed and crossed her legs, her knee pressing into Agatha’s thigh. Agatha, still naked, shifted upright against the headboard with an ease that suggested familiarity, even if none of this had ever happened before. She wasn’t overthinking it. Her body just responded, unbothered, as if this was always how the morning was supposed to go. She watched as Rio took a sip from the mug and held it in her mouth for a moment, staring at Agatha unblinking. Then, without a word, she leaned forward and spit the coffee back into the mug in a slow, steady stream, the sound of it dribbling loud and vaguely offensive in the quiet of her bedroom. Agatha didn’t even blink. She’d expected exactly that. Rio muttered something dry about it being impressive for it being entirely water, and Agatha let out a quiet laugh, took the mug from her hand, and drank from it without looking away. Rio stared at her, wide eyed and trying not to grin. </p><p> </p><p>Eventually, Rio took the other cup and chugged it just to get the caffeine in her system, obviously not for taste. At some point after that, Agatha decided she wanted her shirt back. No reason. No real one, anyway. She just tugged the shirt up and off Rio and tossed it across her room. If she had to sit there exposed, then so did Rio. She told herself it was about fairness. Equal exposure. Civilized nudity. Feminist logic. Whatever.</p><p> </p><p>They stayed like that for hours.</p><p> </p><p>Not touching, but always touching. Elbows, knees, a foot curled under a thigh. They talked. Not about anything that mattered. At some point, Agatha had her phone in hand, scrolling through her work schedule for the month that had just been uploaded to the hospital’s portal- only half paying attention when Rio pulled a face, wild and obnoxious in the middle of her story. Agatha raised her phone and took a picture of Rio without really meaning to. It was too close, all teeth and blurry movement, the edge of Rio’s bare shoulder suggesting more than it showed. Agatha didn’t delete it.  She also didn’t explain it.</p><p> </p><p>At some point, Rio mentioned that everyone was going bowling tonight instead of game night at Jen and Alice’s. Agatha barely processed it at first. Bowling? As in- <em> rented shoes that had been on hundreds of strangers’ feet and the smell of cheap beer and frozen pizza baked into the walls </em>? The word dropped into the room like it belonged to someone else’s afternoon. She didn’t respond right away. Mostly because her brain refused to process the idea of anything existing outside the four walls they were in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. </p><p>
  <br />
  <br />
</p><p>The thought of a bowling alley -sticky floors, fluorescent lights, other people talking- felt violently offensive and so far removed from the bubble they were in. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t want to put clothes on. She didn’t want to see anyone. She didn’t want to leave her house. She didn’t want to wash her sheets. She didn’t want to put a bra on and pretend she hadn’t spent the last twelve hours letting Rio do whatever she wanted to her. She didn’t want to be perceived. By anyone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio said something about only going if Agatha went. Something she had heard before, in what felt like a hundred different lives. Back when they were too proud and too scared and too unwilling to admit they were following each other into places just to be close. It meant more now. Or maybe less. Maybe it was just habit. Agatha couldn’t tell. Only that something small and traitorous inside of her liked the sound of being followed. Of being chosen.</p><p> </p><p>She ended up agreeing, eventually. Of course she did. Because that was the problem with bubbles- they always popped.</p><p> </p><p>But before that, before reality returned, she let herself enjoy the moment for what it was. It was domesticity, she guessed. Or a version of it that involved two naked idiots drinking terrible coffee in bed and pretending it wasn’t a big deal. </p><p> </p><p>What Agatha didn’t say though -what she wouldn’t dare speak into existence- was how much she liked this. Not just the sex, though that had been… a lot. But the after. The stillness. The dumb things. The way Rio kept touching her thigh absentmindedly. The way they didn’t flinch when their skin brushed. The ease of it. The lack of disaster.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, against all better judgment, believed she could handle it. Really. As long as they didn’t talk about it. Not the past, not what it meant, not how good it felt. If they avoided eye contact during any and all emotionally charged moments, if they stuck to jokes and coffee and maybe kept the shirtless photography to a minimum- this could work. She was sure of it.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe, <em> maybe </em> , no morning sex again. Because this morning’s had been <em> really </em> intimate. Like ruin your life intimate. Which was fine. Once. Briefly. But doing that twice would set a precedent Agatha wasn’t prepared to manage. Not yet. Probably not ever. Definitely not before bowling.</p><p> </p><p>Which seemed like a reasonable boundary.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe.</p><p> </p><p>As long as they didn’t talk about it.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha was ready for bowling. </p><p> </p><p>Probably.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They were at Rio’s apartment. Rio didn’t have a single piece of clothing at Agatha’s place, and Agatha had made the executive decision that she would not be seen in public, least of all at a bowling alley, escorting Rio around while she wore Agatha’s clothes and looked freshly fucked. That was not going to happen. She had limits.</p><p> </p><p>After Rio had showered in Agatha’s bathroom -without saying a word about the stupid eucalyptus she definitely saw hanging from the showerhead. Agatha had, for reasons still unclear to her, decided they could show up to bowling together. Together, like a unit. One arrival, one exit. Same car, same time, same breath. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know why. The only explanation she could come up with was that her brain had melted and was now dripping out of her ears.</p><p> </p><p>“I swear to god, if you don’t stop moving, I will beat you with this beauty blender,” Agatha muttered, digging her thumb into Rio’s cheek, dabbing concealer on her jawline with more force than necessary.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, who was currently sitting on her own bathroom counter with her fingers curled into Agatha’s belt loops, had been swinging her feet like an overstimulated child for the past ten minutes. Agatha was close to snapping.</p><p> </p><p>The hickeys weren’t subtle. There was one under her jaw, two along her throat, and another blooming up the edge of her chin like a badge. The worst of them was lower, pressed into the skin over Rio’s sternum, right above her heart. That one was safely hidden under her shirt, but Agatha couldn’t stop thinking about it. She tried to pretend she was relieved it didn’t need makeup. She was not. She was the opposite of relieved.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t even mad at the marks themselves. She was mad that they existed in the first place. Mad that she had let herself fall into this so easily. Mad that she still hadn’t figured out what she was doing or why she cared so much about how it would look when they walked in together.</p><p> </p><p>They hadn’t left Agatha’s house all day. They’d had sex the night before. Then again after the movie. Then again before terrible coffee. Then again before they had left and Rio had bent her in half and turned her into something that could only be described as spiritually unwell. And now here Agatha was. Doing her makeup. Fixing her shirt. Pretending she wasn’t crawling out of her skin.</p><p> </p><p>They had left their bubble, and Agatha hated it. Every second of it. She hated the thought of stepping into a bowling alley and pretending this wasn’t real, pretending she hadn’t spent the last twenty-four hours touching someone in every way that mattered and still couldn’t say out loud what any of it meant.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated how it had never once felt like a mistake.</p><p> </p><p>“I think you should try breathing,” Rio murmured, maddeningly amused, like she could hear every thought screeching through Agatha’s skull.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha froze, blender still in hand, and gave Rio a murderous look. “They’re everywhere,” she hissed, jaw tight. As if the evidence wasn’t the loudest thing in the fucking bathroom.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, absolutely unfazed, leaned in until their faces were inches apart. She smiled, slow and smug, and entirely too aware of what she was doing. “And whose fault is that?” she murmured, gaze dropping to Agatha’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw locked. She forced herself to stay still, to keep her eyes where they belonged, to not replay what that mouth had done to her. “Some idiot who didn’t think about you having to show your face in public,” she muttered, voice rough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s grin stretched wider, all teeth and sin, like she was proud of herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to ignore it. She didn’t need this right now. She needed to finish hiding the proof of her own bad decisions and somehow pretend she wasn’t seconds away from climbing back into Rio’s lap just to shut her up.</p><p> </p><p>There was still bowling to survive. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio had driven. Parked in the farthest, most forgettable corner of the lot, shaded and empty, like she was doing them both a favor. Like she already knew Agatha wouldn’t be able to keep her hands to herself.</p><p> </p><p>What followed was a blur.</p><p> </p><p>Fast, messy, and completely her own fault. Not in a guilty way. Just in the technical sense. Her hand had ended up on Rio’s thigh. Her mouth had found Rio’s neck. She’d said something, maybe nothing, and then Rio was in her lap, straddling her. Agatha’s hand was down the front of her jeans. Their mouths pressed so tightly together it felt like trying to breathe underwater. Rio was riding her fingers like the only thing that mattered was how fast she could come. Which, apparently, was very. Faster than Agatha wanted. Faster than felt fair. But they were already late.<br /><br /></p><p>Then Rio was gone.<br /><br /></p><p>Not metaphorically- literally. Off her lap, out the door, already standing in the parking lot like her bones hadn’t melted over Agatha’s hand two seconds ago. Like nothing had happened at all. </p><p> </p><p>“Ready?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t moved. Her fingers were still wet. Her hand still hung awkwardly in the space Rio had left behind. She didn’t know what she was supposed to do next. Rio’s come still clung to her knuckles. She could still feel it. On her skin. Under her nails. <em> Rio.  </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced down, clocked the pause, and reached across to the console. She pulled a pack of wipes from the glove box. Because of course she had them. Rio had everything figured out, always. Agatha had used to hate that about her. She hated it more in this moment than ever before.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped the pack into Agatha’s lap and peeled a few out, but didn’t hand them over. Instead, she took Agatha’s hand gently, offering her service. First, her mouth- slow, deliberate, obscene. Rio’s tongue dragged along her fingers, cheeks hollowed, jaw tight with effort. It made Agatha’s skin felt hotter than it already was. Her lungs felt wrong. Agatha whimpered. </p><p> </p><p><em> Embarrassing </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Then the wipes. Cool. Sterile. Functional. Erasure.</p><p> </p><p>And just like that the evidence, it was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel it happening. The return to the real world. The pop in the bubble. The crawl of something colder up the back of her neck. She could see the bowling alley from the car windshield. The people, the lights. She could feel the words clawing up her spine, burning their way out of her mouth:</p><p> </p><p>“We’re still frien-”</p><p> </p><p>“Friends,” Rio said simply. “Yeah. Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was zipping her jeans, reaching for her baseball cap in the floorboard Agatha had knocked off somewhere between moaning and forgetting her own name. Rio settled it back onto her head, kissed the corner of her mouth like she was sealing something shut for Agatha’s sake, and gave her a tight lipped smile that didn’t touch her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t hot. It wasn’t cold. It was... polite.</p><p> </p><p>A thank you.</p><p> </p><p>A goodbye for now. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed around the knot in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said and her throat burned hot. </p><p> </p><p>Just her name, but Agatha packed every plea she could into it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Slow down. Look at me. Take this seriously. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t say a word. No screaming from the rooftops that I finally fucked Agatha Harkness. I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha almost said thank you. She bit down on her tongue hard enough to taste blood.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want anyone to say anything,” Agatha said. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded. “They won’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t promise that.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Rio agreed. “But I can tackle whoever tries.”</p><p> </p><p>That startled a laugh out of Agatha. Brief, sharp, ugly. “Yeah, because that wouldn’t make it obvious.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled. “Then I’ll make sure it’s worth it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything else. She couldn’t. Her tongue felt too thick. Her brain couldn’t hold all the parts of her trying to split open. She’d wanted Rio to act like it was nothing, and Rio had. Perfectly. Respectfully.</p><p> </p><p>And she hated how much comfort she took in it. Hated how badly she needed Rio to treat it like nothing so she wouldn’t have to admit it had been everything.</p><p> </p><p>Now Agatha had to sit with what that felt like.</p><p> </p><p>She wiped her palms on her jeans and got out of the car, pretending that the ache in her chest was just leftover adrenaline. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tightened her jaw and followed Rio in silence. The parking lot was loud. A bass line from somewhere inside was already thudding through the pavement, vibrating up through Agatha’s shoes. She rolled her shoulders back, tried to remember how her face was supposed to work. Neutral expression. Mild interest. Like she hadn’t just fucked Rio in her car. </p><p> </p><p>At the entrance, Rio held the door open without looking at her. Agatha stepped into a rounded atrium glowing with soft pink light, casting a sheen over polished concrete floors and curved metal trim. At the center stood a circular desk with staff in black polos moving quickly behind it- scanning people in, handing out shoes, pulling up pre-booked lanes on mounted tablets.</p><p> </p><p>Rio headed straight for the counter without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha followed. She kept her gaze moving, scanning the layout- instinct. To the right, the arcade sat behind a pane of tinted glass, pulsing with retro lighting and what looked like a trillion different arcade games. To the left, past a velvet rope and an arched hallway, there was an outdoor lounge tucked under string lights and heat lamps, like the place hosted live music or influencer birthday parties on the weekends. </p><p> </p><p>The whole thing was too nice. Too designed. It left Agatha weirdly alert.</p><p> </p><p>When they reached the counter, Rio leaned forward slightly, already speaking to the attendant. She rattled off something about a reservation under Kale. The attendant nodded, tapping quickly at the screen, and asked about shoe sizes. </p><p> </p><p>“Eight,” Rio said. “And seven.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at her, but didn’t say anything.</p><p> </p><p>The attendant nodded again, turned, and pulled their sizes from the shelves, sliding the shoes across the counter. A total was given. Before Agatha could reach for her purse, Rio had already pulled out her wallet, slipping her card into the reader. A receipt was handed over. A lane number. No questions. No discussion. It was all handled before Agatha even remembered she might’ve offered to split it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned and handed her the shoes, brushing the edge of Agatha’s fingers. Her hand was warm. She kept the other under her arm.</p><p> </p><p>“You good?” Rio asked, softly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. It wasn’t a lie, but it also wasn’t not her mutely acknowledging the fact that Rio had just handled the entire interaction without even checking in.</p><p> </p><p>She could’ve been annoyed. Should’ve been, maybe. But instead, she felt the smallest, sharpest relief. Like she hadn’t realized she’d been holding her shoulders that tight until Rio made space for her to breathe. </p><p> </p><p>Which was horrifying. </p><p> </p><p>Together, they stepped away from the desk, shoes in hand, and headed toward the lanes.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like she was walking into a fucking fever dream. <em> Pink Pony Club </em> was playing over the speaker system, the bass thumping through the floor like it was trying to rearrange her spine. Neon spilled across every surface- walls pulsing magenta, bar lights rotating in slow blues and purples.</p><p> </p><p>They rounded the corner toward their assigned lane, and the first thing Agatha saw was Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Standing on a couch. Not sitting. Standing. In socks with a beer bottle in one hand, her back to them, throwing her ass around with full dedication as she shouted the lyrics loud enough to drown out the speakers. Not one ounce of shame anywhere in her body.</p><p> </p><p>Billy nursed a violently pink cocktail with three straws, somehow managing to look both horrified and enchanted. Alice clapped along like she was front row at a drag show. Jen stood off to the side, filming the chaos with a grin. Yelena stood near the bar, completely ignoring whatever Nat was saying in her ear. Her attention hadn’t moved once from Sage, a stunned grin tugging at her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Their section was a mess of half finished drinks, abandoned shoes, and the quiet thrum of too much energy too early in the night. Everyone else seemed to take it in stride.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did not.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t panicking, exactly. But she was absolutely aware of every single choice she had made in the past twenty four hours, and how they had all led, very directly, to this moment. </p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped beside her and brushed their arms together. Let her elbow linger against Agatha’s. And when Agatha didn’t move, she turned her head slightly, just enough that her voice could reach her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve seen her do worse,” Rio said. “This is actually pretty tame, considering.”</p><p> </p><p>It was stupid, how effective that was. Agatha felt her body start to unwind without permission. Her shoulders dropped. The static in her chest eased. She could still hear Sage yelling over the music, still see Jen grinning with her phone out, still feel the dozen pairs of eyes that might eventually swing her way. But none of it carried the same charge it had a minute ago.</p><p> </p><p>This was ridiculous. Absolutely, unarguably absurd. But it was also fine.</p><p> </p><p>She had stepped into it willingly- into the noise, the chaos, the weird orbit of people who clapped when Sage got up on furniture. She had invited it. She’d opened the door and let Rio back in, and maybe she hadn’t planned for what came after, but she was here now.</p><p> </p><p>And strangely, impossibly, she didn’t feel out of place.</p><p> </p><p>Let the music play. Let Sage keep dancing on furniture. Let the whole night spiral into chaos if it wanted to. None of it mattered- so long as no one said her name and Rio Vidal’s in the same goddamn sentence.</p><p> </p><p>Because if they did, Agatha was going to jail. </p><p> </p><p>When Sage turned around and spotted them, her eyes lit up like someone had just handed her fire.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, well, well,” Sage shouted over the music, pointing her beer bottle directly at them. “Look who finally decided to show their faces.”</p><p> </p><p>It was an announcement that made the entire group turn. Heads swiveled. Conversations paused. Jen lowered her phone, grinning already. Alice let out a dramatic gasp. Even Billy perked up, eyes locked on Agatha with a cartoonish smile. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha considered turning on her heel and walking straight back out the door, but she knew better. That would only draw more attention.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in slightly, elbow still touching hers. “Too late to run,” she murmured, entirely unbothered.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Rio was already peeling away from her side, heading toward the couch like she didn’t feel every single person in the room watching her go.</p><p> </p><p>Sage hopped down with zero concern for physics or beer spillage. She barely landed before setting her beer down and launching herself at Rio with both arms outstretched like she was aiming for a tackle. Rio, instead of ducking, caught her and promptly dragged her into a chokehold, arm looped loosely around her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shouted something unintelligible and shoved at her ribs, but Rio only tightened her grip a little and muttered something into her hair that made Sage bark out a laugh. Sage broke free and shoved Rio with both hands, grinning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched from where she stood, utterly still.</p><p> </p><p>They were absurd. Loud, physical, tangled up in each other’s space without apology. It was juvenile. It was annoying.</p><p> </p><p> It was exhausting just to look at.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had come here for bowling. For shoe rentals and hoping for low stakes small talk and something that didn’t ask her to feel anything she couldn’t walk away from. And now here she was, pretending she could stand at the edge of Rio’s life without wanting to be pulled all the way back in. </p><p> </p><p>She wanted access to it. Full fucking access. She wanted to know the version of Rio that didn’t belong to her anymore. The one that kept showing up in pieces she didn’t recognize- comfortable, rooted, known by people who weren’t her. That was all. Nothing serious.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t let the thought linger. She couldn’t. And besides, Teen was already headed her way, pink drink in hand, eyes lit up like he was about to say something she didn’t have the patience for. She stepped forward before he could say anything, cutting him off with pure efficiency, and dropped onto the couch to deal with the shoes. They were hideous. She tied them with the precision of someone preparing for combat.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever else was happening tonight, she was still here to win. </p><p> </p><p>Winning was the only thing that made any of this tolerable. It always had been. Bowling, cards, trivia- she didn’t care. The sooner she got on a lane, the sooner she could stop thinking about Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Or, failing that, at least pretend wanting to sit beside her had something to do with strategy.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The next hour passed without incident. She was in the lead, obviously. Rio was close behind her, which felt both predictable and vaguely offensive in its irony. Of course she was chasing her. Agatha didn’t bother keeping track of the others. They existed purely as background noise. Her focus was fixed, single minded, and competitive enough to be borderline pathological. Stay ahead. That was the game. That was always the game.</p><p> </p><p>To her surprise, Jen hadn’t pounced the second they were alone. She hadn’t asked about Rio, hadn’t pried, hadn’t so much as raised an eyebrow about how they’d shown up together. And that, somehow, was worse. Jen knew her too well not to notice and Agatha knew better than to mistake it for oversight. This was Jen throwing Agatha a bone, and Agatha snatched it like she hadn’t eaten in weeks.</p><p> </p><p>They were wedged together on the couch now, Jen deep in the trenches of workplace gossip while Agatha sat rapt, drinking in every petty detail. She didn’t care if it made her a terrible person. Gossip was currency, and she wanted to be rich. Jen had just started in on a particularly scandalous rumor about one of the newer residents when Jen’s name was called, and she stood with a groan, muttering that she’d finish the story later.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely had a second to process the absence beside her before she felt the shift. That brief, eerie stillness like the top of a rollercoaster. Across from her, Sage and Billy were seated on the opposite couch, both their eyes had snapped to the newly vacated seat and then immediately to each other. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p> </p><p>They moved in tandem, limbs clashing as they scrambled to beat the other across the short distance. Billy led with his shoulder, aiming to brute force his way in, but Sage was faster, meaner, and had clearly come prepared to humiliate him. She shoved him backward with enough force to send him crashing back into his seat, then stepped onto the low table between the couches, using it as leverage to hurl herself into the empty spot. She landed hard next to Agatha, planted and smug, barely breaking a sweat. </p><p> </p><p>The whole thing unfolded in less than five seconds. It was insane. Absolutely uncalled for. But at this point, not remotely surprising.</p><p> </p><p>Billy flailed dramatically across from them, scowling as he adjusted his shirt. “You’re insane,” he snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t even look at him. “You were in my way.”</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus, you’re so aggressive-”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I’m sorry, do you want me to be gentler next time? Maybe write you a poem while I kick your ass?”</p><p> </p><p>Billy scoffed. “You’re gonna die alone.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage smiled. “Maybe. But at least I’ll die a winner.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage turned to her just as Agatha watched Jen’s ball roll straight into the gutter, hopeless from the moment it left her hand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t really spoken to Sage since the adopted sister reveal. That particular bomb had been dropped with no warning and even less tact, and Agatha still wasn’t sure what to do with it. Sage kept trying- always cheerful, always conveniently nearby. She showed up in the NICU with x-ray orders and thinly veiled small talk, acted overly casual at game nights.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rarely gave her anything back. It wasn’t personal. Or maybe it was. She wasn’t sure. The whole situation felt like a trick she hadn’t realized she was falling for until the pieces were already in place.</p><p> </p><p>“Billy’s starting to think you like him more than me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t like either of you.” Agatha glanced at her, then immediately looked away.</p><p> </p><p>Sage hummed under her breath, unconvinced. “You’re upset with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s ridiculous.” Agatha scoffed, unwilling to look at her. </p><p> </p><p>“You won’t even look at me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Maybe that’s because you bamboozled me.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage let out a soft laugh. “Bamboozled you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally turned to face her, eyes sharp. “Yes. Bamboozled. Hoodwinked. Strategically misled,” she hissed, the words clipped and fast. </p><p> </p><p>Sage blinked, obviously thrown. “What are you even talking about?”</p><p> </p><p>“Game night.” Agatha snapped. “You knew exactly what you were keeping from me. Was that the plan? Get in first, play nice, make it easier to stomach the fucking info bomb she dropped on me? I don’t fuck with being played.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage nodded along, dragging out the sound. “Ohhh.” It was theatrical. Mock realization. Then, flatly- </p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, waiting for more. </p><p> </p><p>Sage only shrugged. “I’d heard a lot about you. I wanted to see for myself what all the fuss was about.” Her tone wasn’t defensive- it was honest, maybe even a little proud. “Didn’t say anything because I figured you’d write me off before I got a word in.”</p><p> </p><p>“So you thought deception was the best way to introduce yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t deceive you.”</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t correct me.” Agatha shot back. </p><p> </p><p>“Was I wrong to do that?”</p><p> </p><p>Absolutely yes. But also no. If she’d known then what she knew now, it wouldn’t have been silence- it would’ve been scorched earth. She would’ve stayed long enough to ruin the energy, to make sure they both understood exactly how fucked it was.</p><p> </p><p>Or maybe not. Maybe she would’ve done nothing at all. At this point she doesn’t really care.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, considering. “I don’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t clarify. She wasn’t offering more. It was just the truth- ugly and incomplete.</p><p> </p><p>Sage nodded. “Cool. Great talk. Can you stop being weird now?” </p><p> </p><p>“I’m not being weird.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re absolutely being weird. And it’s making me weird, which I don’t like.” She nudged her heel against Agatha’s foot. “So let’s move on before it gets anymore awkward and I have to light myself on fire.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed, “You wouldn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“I would. I’ve got matches in the car. Let’s bowl and pretend none of that happened. For your sake, not mine. Oh, and tell Billy you like me more than him… Strictly for morale.”</p><p> </p><p>It pulled a laugh out of Agatha before she could stop it- brief, involuntary, too real to take back. Sage caught it and didn’t gloat, just nodded like that was the outcome she’d been aiming for all along.</p><p> </p><p>Then Sage stood, grabbed a ball off the rack, and as she turned toward the lane, she tossed over her shoulder, easy-</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia keeps asking about you, by the way. It’s starting to get sad. Don’t make the woman beg, Agatha.” Sage didn’t wait for a reply. Just lined herself up at the edge of the lane, eyes locked on the pins.</p><p> </p><p>No pause for effect. No fishing for a response.</p><p> </p><p>Just a hit and run. The way Rio would’ve done it.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha sat there and watched, dumbfounded- like a fucking fool.</p><p> </p><p>Infuriating. Effortless. Entirely intentional. Undeniably related to Rio fucking Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood in line at the snack counter, arms crossed, posture rigid, and fully committed to pretending she cared about ordering a Diet Coke. She didn’t. She wasn’t thirsty. She wasn’t hungry. She just needed something to do that didn’t involve throwing a bowling ball at someone’s head. Not anyone in particular. Just… in the general direction of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing about Rio’s behavior was overtly wrong. She hadn’t been cold. She hadn’t been distant. She had been polite. Friendly. Reasonable. Fucking normal. </p><p> </p><p>It was psychotic.</p><p> </p><p>And fine- Agatha had wanted her to keep it quiet. She’d set the boundary. That was fair.</p><p> </p><p>But did Rio have to be so fucking good at it?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crossed her arms and shifted her weight, and clenched her jaw. She imagined grabbing Rio by the collar and demanding to know why she hadn’t even bothered to flirt with her tonight. Why she hadn’t been insufferably up Agatha’s ass. Why she had stopped acting like Agatha was the most interesting person in the room.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had decided to behave. Which was apparently the worst thing she could have done because Agatha hated her for it. </p><p> </p><p>Not really. But enough to stand in this stupid line and stew about it. She wasn’t going to look for Rio. She wasn’t going to say anything. This was exactly what she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>So why did it feel less like control and more like loss?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took one step forward in the line. She could feel her own expression curling into something unpleasant. She knew she looked mad. She didn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>And then she felt that familiar presence she couldn’t ignore even if she tried behind her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha straightened automatically, but she didn’t turn around. She didn’t say anything. She just stared at the menu and reminded herself that throwing a tantrum in public was generally frowned upon.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, Rio said nothing. She just stood there, close enough to be a presence but not enough to push it. Then her voice came, low and maddeningly casual.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweetheart.” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes didn’t move from the board. She could feel the heat in her neck immediately, the pressure building behind her eyes and in the tight corners of her jaw. She didn’t want to respond. She wanted to keep pretending she had the upper hand, that she was the one who had walked away unaffected, that she hadn’t been mentally screaming since the moment Rio stopped paying attention to her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not mad,” Agatha muttered, voice stiff and entirely unconvincing.</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Rio said simply.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha repeated, now fully aware of how juvenile she sounded but too deep in it to stop.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>That was it. That was all she got. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha half turned her body, whipped her head around, and stared at Rio fucking stunned.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was just standing there. Relaxed. Polite.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned back slowly, jaw clenched, pulse thrumming in her throat. She wanted to scream.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re pissing me off,” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m doing what you wanted,” Rio replied, calm as anything.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, it’s pissing me off.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, like that amused her. “Come smoke with me.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.” She folded her arms tighter. “I don’t think I will.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, Agatha’s body betrayed her. Her shoulders eased, barely, as though they’d been waiting for permission. That tone. That inflection. No one else ever said her name like that. She didn’t answer. She let her eyes close, slow and controlled, maybe if she moved carefully enough she wouldn’t have to acknowledge what it did to her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped in, too close now, her breath warm at the shell of Agatha’s ear. Not touching, but close enough to feel it.</p><p> </p><p>“I miss you,” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lip curled.<em> That was better.</em></p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t moved. Was still standing there, probably poking her tongue against the inside of her cheek the way she always did when she didn’t know if she was losing or winning.</p><p> </p><p>Good. Let her wonder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything else right away. She let the silence stretch, let the tension settle again. She liked the way Rio was holding still, like any sudden movement might ruin it.</p><p> </p><p>“You gonna say something else that’ll make me feel better, or just stand there breathing on me?”</p><p> </p><p>“You want me to beg?” Rio said, voice infuriatingly steady.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t care what you do,” Agatha shot back, adding a shrug for effect. Unbothered. Not insanely aware of how turned on she was. Not at all.</p><p> </p><p>There was a pause. Then Rio leaned in, closer than she had all night, her body leaning in just enough to press up against Agatha’s back. Not hands. Not hips. Just the faint pressure of crossed arms brushing against the middle of Agatha’s back- light, contained, like she was trying not to touch her at all and failing on purpose.  </p><p> </p><p>“Stay at my place tonight,” Rio said, soft. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked.  She could feel Rio straining under all that self control, her body betraying her in the smallest, most satisfying ways. And fuck, it felt like winning.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, I don’t know,” Agatha said lightly, loading it with just enough condescension to make herself feel powerful. “We have work tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>And she expected that to be the end of it. Expected Rio to back off. To take the hit and behave, like she’d been doing all night. Good girl. Gold star.</p><p> </p><p>But then- </p><p> </p><p>“Please.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t even a word. Not really. Just breath, hot against her ear, low and dangerous and too fucking soft.</p><p> </p><p>“Please, baby. I’ll do anything.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a sound. It wasn’t intentional. Wasn’t dignified. It punched out of her in a pathetic little gasp- high in her throat, half a whimper, half a groan, fully, irreparably fucking humiliating.</p><p> </p><p>She went still.</p><p> </p><p>Fully frozen. Eyes wide, chest locked, brain freshly wiped by the horny wrath of god.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Alright. Wrap it up. Wrap it the fuck up, Agatha.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” she snapped, too loud and too fast, already turning away like the sound hadn’t come from her at all. Because if she didn’t walk off right then -immediately, with purpose- she was going to do something catastrophic. Something irreversible. Something she would absolutely not be able to explain to security.</p><p> </p><p>She stormed back toward their group with her jaw tight and her hands clenched into fists at her sides, walking like she hadn’t just nearly collapsed because a woman said please.</p><p> </p><p>It was fine.</p><p> </p><p>She was fine.</p><p> </p><p>Totally calm. Totally in control. Definitely not seconds away from hauling Rio into the nearest disgusting bowling alley bathroom and dropping to her knees. </p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Jesus Christ. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed a Diet Coke and a fucking lobotomy.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was standing, grabbing the last of her shit, counting down the seconds until she could get out of this godforsaken neon lit purgatory with Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was on the far side of their section, leaned up against the plastic high top counter. It was one of those built in setups, too high to sit at comfortably, with stools and the open racks underneath for bowling balls, like some bastardization of a bar and a storage unit. She had her arms crossed loosely, talking to Sage and Alice like nothing was out of place. Like she hadn’t whispered ‘<em> please, baby. I’ll do anything.’ </em>against Agatha’s ear earlier and then gone right back to looking like a smug, patient son of a bitch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had tried -<em> tried </em>- desperately not to notice her. Not to track every change in posture, every glance, every small movement that reminded her exactly how far she was from losing control in public. It hadn’t worked. Of course it hadn’t. Rio was right there, in the same goddamn bowling alley, being hot and polite and pretending like she didn’t know Agatha was one more breath away from losing her shit.</p><p> </p><p>Teen was on the couch beside her, talking at length about… Agatha doesn’t fucking know. But she was nodding along like she could hear it. She couldn't. She was too busy focusing on the clock, on her breath, on the promise of being done with this place and in Rio’s car. The night was almost over. She was almost free.</p><p> </p><p>And then- </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p> </p><p>She felt her stomach drop so violently she was sure she had just shit it out of her own asshole. </p><p> </p><p>It came from the wrong direction. It came from a voice that should not, under any circumstances, have been here.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned slowly, already knowing what she would see and still unprepared for it.</p><p> </p><p>
  <em> Wanda. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Not in Chicago.</p><p> </p><p>Here.</p><p> </p><p>In the middle of a bowling alley in fucking Westview, New Jersey.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her ex-wife, eyes locked and expression neutral, even as her brain started screaming: <em> No, I want more time! </em></p><p> </p><p>It was grief, like something sacred being ripped out by its roots. A primal, internal protest against the inevitability that nothing Wanda touched ever survived. Even permanence learned to wilt beneath it. </p><p> </p><p>“Can we talk?” Wanda asked, soft.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, mouth dry, heart shredding through her chest. She didn’t have an answer.</p><p> </p><p>Still, her fingers twitched -just barely, just once- in the direction of Rio Vidal, who was not looking at her. Of course. Classic. Same reach as before. Still pathetic. Still unanswered. And yet, apparently, her body hadn’t gotten the memo, because here it was again. Subtle. Stupid. Waiting around like a little idiot, just in case Rio fucking Vidal wanted to notice this time.</p><p> </p><p>This was what it looked like when the universe put a hand between her shoulder blades and whispered, <em> ‘You don’t get to have that.’ </em></p><p> </p><p>But Agatha saw it in her periphery- a blur of motion veering straight toward her ex-wife. She didn’t bother looking. Just let her eyes fall shut and waited.</p><p> </p><p>A shout followed. Wanda’s voice, loud with disbelief. </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha opened her eyes, Rio was standing in front of her. A little out of breath from crossing the room. Or maybe from thirteen years of trying to get here in time.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, still a little winded. “Sorry I’m late.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned to look behind her. Agatha followed her gaze- Wanda, soaked. Sage crouched beside the fallen pitcher, scrambling, mouthing a series of apologies that couldn’t have sounded less genuine. Beer everywhere.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked back at Agatha, a small smile pulling at her mouth like she didn’t regret a single second of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Had to improvise.” Rio said, with a shrug that felt too easy to be innocent. She reached out slightly, a fingertip grazing the back of Agatha’s hand. “Let’s go back to mine, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p> </p>
