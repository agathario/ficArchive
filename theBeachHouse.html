     Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      The silence stretched for an entire minute before Rio rose from the chair, turning to face Agatha who hadn’t moved from the opened fridge.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Agatha?”
     </p>
     <p>
      Rio watched as Agatha’s body tensed but still she didn’t turn, didn’t release her grip on the opened door.
     </p>
     <p>
      “Why didn’t you come to my wedding?”

     Let Down

    <p>
     The beach house stood resolutely against the backdrop of the picturesque coastline, nestled near the water’s edge. It was just after dawn when Rio Vidal stood in her oversized worn hoody gazing out at the rolling waves, the salty breeze tousling her black hair. She had planned this weekend meticulously, drawing her closest friends together at the place they had spent most of their summer’s during and after college.
    </p>
    <p>
     Memories flooded back as she stood there; the house held countless summers of laughter and love. Her thoughts drifted wistfully to bygone days when they were younger and care free. If she closed her eyes she could still see Alice singing on the coffee table with a hairbrush while she and Jen skipped around the table, drinks raised in the air. She would see Lilia practicing tarot on Billy while Agatha sat rolling her eyes at every prediction.
     <br/>
     Those were the best chapters in Rio Vidal’s life.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sound of gravel crunching signalled the arrival of a car. Rio turned, a soft smile gracing her features as Jen and Alice emerged with bags in hand, their faces bright with anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio!” Alice exclaimed, taking the stairs two at a time to enfold Rio in a warm hug. “It’s been too long.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice may have looked terrifying to anyone at first meeting, red streaks through her black hair, winged eyeliner sharp enough to kill a man, but Rio had never met anyone as caring as Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen followed suit, her embrace gentle and lingering. “We’ve missed you, Rio. This was a wonderful idea.”
     <br/>
     Jen exuded poise, her demeanour having softened in her 30s, which made her much more approachable, provided she liked you.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve missed you both, too,” Rio replied, her voice touched with emotion. “I was shocked to see this place is still here. Thanks for coming, I thought it was about damn time we came back here.” She pulled back to look at the two women fondly, tracing every inch of her friends’s faces.
    </p>
    <p>
     As if on cue, another vehicle pulled up, immediately apparent by the slow speed of the car that Billy was the driver of said vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The muffled sound of voiced echoed across the pebbled driveway before the back door of the car was thrusted opened and the owner of the voice became clear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I swear if you drove any fucking slower Teen time would run backwards!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     A myriad of emotions crossed Rio’s features as she watched as Agatha stepped out the car, her long mane of brown hair danced with the breeze as she strode towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     “3 fucking hours on a flight then stuck in THAT with the Twink and Kooky? This weekend better blow my mind Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s good to see you too Agatha” Rio smirked her fingers itching to reach out and pull the woman into a home crushing hug.
    </p>
    <p>
     But she cant.
    </p>
    <p>
     She never did have the courage to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha returned the smile, her eyes softening briefly as they roamed up and down Rio’s tall frame, crinkling slightly and creasing her brow, as her mouth parted to speak when she noticed Jen and Alice standing watching the encounter with too much intrigue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Kale, I’d love to say it’s good to see you but I told my therapist I would cut the bullshit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Finally getting the professional help you need? Doubt it would work, you’ll always be a bitch.” Jen said sarcastically, rolling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously? It’s been like 20 years will you two ever just get along?” Alice said standing between the two women glaring daggers at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, let’s help with the bags” Rio said through a smile as she gently pulled at Agatha’s arm, not noticing the way the other woman’s breath hitched and her eyes shot to the side of Rio’s head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ignoring the smug look on Jen’s face who had clearly caught the change in her features when Rio touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy, or Teen as Agatha had named him when they first met, as he was still 19 while the rest had already entered their twenties, gave a wave from the trunk of the car as he unloaded the bags.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lilia, what have you got in this bag? A body?” Teen huffed as he pulled out a large suitcase.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.” Lilia said dryly as she exited the car, her grey curls whipping in the breeze as her eyes scanned the house, a look of nostalgia on her features as she smiled fondly, taking a deep inhale of the sea air and closing her eyes.
     <br/>
     Opening them slowly, she seemed to remember herself as she snapped her eyes to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, my girl, how are you dear?” Pulling the younger woman into her arms before pulling back slightly.
     <br/>
     “You’re too skinny. Are you eating? You had better not be on that ozempia bullshit!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio barked out a laugh as she detached herself and began to help Billy carry the bags. Her grunts indicating that it was more of a struggle than expected.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh yeah, don’t worry ladies, we’ll get the bags!” Teen shouted as Agatha and Lilia strolled up the porch steps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia waved her hand lazily in the air while Agatha tilted her head over her shoulder with a wink.
    </p>
    <p>
     After two trips, Billy and Rio had successfully unloaded the bags into the beach house while the others had gathered on the terrace overlooking the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy began to stride towards them when he looked back at Rio who had taken a seat at the kitchen table, beads of sweat pebbling on her temple as she removed the hoodie.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah I’m good, you go on ahead, just that old knee injury plays up sometimes” she said with a tight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     She waited until Billy was out of sight before letting out a loud breath, her shoulders falling as she panted, wiping the sweat away from her brow with the back of her wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Old age creeping up on yah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s body flinched as she suddenly realised Agatha had been standing just out of sight the entire time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Im still 3 years younger than you grandma” Rio replied cooly as she turned to face her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha regarded Rio closely. A flicker of concern crossed her face, betraying her composure. Rio had always been the most active and physically fit of the group so it was surprising to Agatha to see such a mundane task take its toll on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearing her throat and making her way to the fridge she pulled back the door and flicked her hair over her shoulder, pretending to inspect the contents.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, where the wife?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed and closed her eyes, her fingers clenching in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Arriving later.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed in response feigning disinterest, still inspecting the fridge.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence stretched for an entire minute before Rio rose from the chair, turning to face Agatha who hadn’t moved from the opened fridge.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched as Agatha’s body tensed but still she didn’t turn, didn’t release her grip on the opened door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why didn’t you come to my wedding?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha dropped her head slightly as she took in a steadying breath. She had anticipated this conversation for years, she hadn’t anticipated how her body would betray her. Instead of the practiced lie she had told everyone at the time, she knew with the emotion behind Rio’s voice, the hurt etched in each word, her brain refused to co-operate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Closing the door to the refrigerator, she turned, staring into Rio’s warm brown eyes she wanted to break down every wall she had built to separate herself from Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     The same Rio who had been her best friend through all high school, college and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
     The same Rio she had always been deeply, madly in love with.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wanted to tell her that having to watch as she married someone else would have killed her. It was hard enough to know the wedding was happening, but to have to watch it happen with her own eyes? Agatha knew she wouldn’t have survived that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Agatha made up a bullshit lie and locked herself in her apartment barely eating and sobbing into her pillow for an entire week.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told you I had a work thing I couldn’t get out of.” Flicking her hair and pursing her lips, she snaked her hands in the pockets of her slacks as she tilted her chin defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes flickered briefly, anger flashing through her amber eyes before they dipped down to look at the floor letting out a small hollow laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could see the hurt radiating from Rio, her usual full and broad shoulders now hunched slightly and her collarbones more prominent. Lilia had called it out earlier but now as Agatha observed Rio she was noticing the subtle physical changes in the other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Im sorry Rio. Really, I am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised her head to look at Agatha, she could see the sincerity in her blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I miss you.” Rio’s voice sounded smaller than Agatha had ever heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
     The resolve she had built over the years crumbled at the sound of Rio’s broken voice and owl eyes staring at her pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stepped forward and pulled Rio by the back of her head towards her into a crushing hug, cradling her head as Rio rested her chin on Agatha’s shoulder, her arms wrapped tightly around her waist, gripping Agatha’s shirt at the back.
     <br/>
     Tilting her head, Agatha breathed in, inhaling the familiar scent of Rio’s natural earthy scent, her eyes closing as she suppressed a hum from escaping.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's entire body tingled with a warm, electric sensation as she wrapped her arms around Rio, her heart fluttering wildly at their closeness. She had missed Rio profoundly, yet had convinced herself that if she kept her distance, Rio wouldn't notice her absence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, feeling the tightness of Rio’s embrace and hearing the heartfelt confession of how much she had been missed, a wave of regret washed over her as she cursed herself internally.
    </p>
    <p>
     The pair stayed clutching at each other, neither one making any attempt to detach until voices approaching pulled them apart reluctantly just as Alice and Lilia appeared in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned herself away from the newcomers as she smoothed her hair and swiped at a stray tear she hadn’t noticed had escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Knowing that she wouldn’t be able to hide the array of emotions on her face in time to greet the two women, she quickly dipped out of the kitchen, ignoring Lilia’s sarcastic quip about interrupting.
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as the door to her room was firmly closed the damn of emotions collapsed and a sob tore from her throat as she brought the back of her hand up to her mouth to muffle the noise.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio had invited her to this trip she promised herself she would be able to hold it together for the entire trip. Now here she was an hour in and falling completely apart.
    </p>
    <p>
     She knew it would be hard, seeing Rio for the first time in over a year. They had spoken a couple of times since then but nothing like they used to. They were inseparable all through high school and college, their friends would tease them relentlessly, insinuating that they should just hurry up and get married as they asked so much like a married couple.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had realised in college that she was in love with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had shown up in the middle of the night at Agatha’s dorm and dragged her outside to watch a meteor shower, forcing her down until they were both sprawled on the campus lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lying on the damp grass, Agatha turned her head to take in Rio’s features as the lights from the shooting stars illuminated her face, her adorable gapped tooth smile melting her heart, she had reached out and grasped the other girls hand in her own looking back up at the night sky. That was the night Agatha knew she was in love with her best friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wiping her face she made her way to the window, pushing it open to inhale some sea air to calm her rapid breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sounds of voices from outside pulled her attention as she watched as someone was exiting out a newly parked car.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha spotted the red hair immediately before the woman had fully emerged from the car, reigniting Agatha’s sharp breaths and increased heart rate as Rio approached the woman, wrapping her in a tight embrace, not as close as she had just held Agatha but still intimate enough to show affection.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     The woman who married the love of Agatha’s life.

    <p>
     Agatha watched the two embrace from the window, her heart tightening at the tender way Wanda gently cradled Rio’s face, pressing a delicate kiss to her forehead before they both vanished from view, likely retreating into the house below.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda was everything Agatha was not.
    </p>
    <p>
     Where Agatha was sharp-tongued and prickly, Wanda was soft-spoken and nurturing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda was more open with her affection, while Agatha often recoiled from touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     In every way, Wanda seemed perfect for Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     …But she wasn’t Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     A sigh escaped her as she moved toward the large mirror on the wall, inspecting the damage of her breakdown.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes were red, mascara smudged beneath her eyelids, highlighting faint wrinkles at the corners. Red blotches stained her cheeks and neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     She studied her reflection for a moment before beginning to wipe away the smudged mascara, applying powder to conceal the redness. Satisfied, she decided she was presentable enough to head back downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was time to face the music, to put on her best performance and pretend everything was perfectly normal, even as she felt herself slowly crumbling inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she made her way down the last few steps of the wooden staircase she heard hushed voices coming from the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know you want to enjoy your weekend Rio, but I won’t stand by and watch as you push yourself too far.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m fine Wanda, I don’t need you hovering over me like I’m made of glass. I won’t break just because I’m having a bit of fun.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. But Rio…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Feeling like she was eavesdropping, Agatha cleared her throat to announce her presence just outside the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda paused mid-conversation, poking her head around the corner, her green eyes landing on Agatha immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s eyes were glistening with tears, edges slightly reddened, on the verge of tears but Agatha could tell she was trying very hard holding them back.
    </p>
    <p>
     A fond smile with a hint of something unreadable crossed the redhead’s features as she greeted Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey Agatha, it’s good to see you again.” She said genuinely, another point for Wanda, she always was the bigger person.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wished she could say the same to Wanda, but deep down Agatha’s stomach would churn in the presence of the other woman, a bitter jealousy rooted deep in her bones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put on her best face, which materialised as a tight lipped smile, more of a grimace really.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda, I heard you weren’t arriving until later today.” Deflecting any pleasantries she would have to force out of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That was the plan, but Rio would forget her own head if it wasn’t screwed on so I had to bring her…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda stop. Why don’t we go join the others outside?” Rio interrupted from behind Wanda, her gaze intent as she looked into her wife’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched the silent exchange unfold, noting the quiet dialogue passing between them. Eventually, Wanda let out a sigh and raised her hands in surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
     Curious, Agatha thought. She had never seen the two women show anything but pure adoration for one another. Seeing them in a heated exchange, the air crackling with tension was a whole new experience. Agatha didn’t know how she felt about this new development. Excited perhaps?
    </p>
    <p>
     “You two go ahead, I’ll start unpacking.” The red head said softly, reaching out to gently squeeze Rio’s arm. Agatha’s eyes tracked the movement, her body tightening almost instinctively.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning on her heel, Agatha made her way towards the patio doors, she could hear Rio’s footsteps behind her, the soft sounds of her breathing as she closed the distance between them. She cursed herself for even noticing how much Rio’s proximity affected her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Glancing over her shoulder, she knew she shouldn’t have mentioned anything but her heart and mind were screaming at her for answers.
     <br/>
     “Trouble in paradise?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t answer, instead she passed by Agatha with a coy smile on her face as she placed her hand on the patio door handle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is my paradise”
    </p>
    <p>
     Sliding the patio door opened she was greeted with the cool salty air, a familiar scent which instantly brought her mind back to better days. Days where she and Rio were still attached at the hip, a time where her world had’nt ended yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Was that Wanda we heard arriving?” Lilia quipped as the pair made their way onto the wooden terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched as both Jen and Billy’s eyes darted between her and Rio, watching intently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, she’s just getting unpacked, she’ll be down in a bit.” Rio said as she flopped herself down onto one of the Adirondack chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved to the opposite side of the terrace perched against the railing, facing the ocean as she watched the waves in an attempt to channel the rhythm of the sea to align her breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The conversation behind her picked up naturally as she zoned out everything except the sounds of the water rolling onto the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shouldn’t have come here. She knew this was exactly how her body would react, the same way it had any other time she had been forced to be around Rio since Wanda had came into the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind brought her back to Alice and Jen’s wedding where Wanda was first introduced as Rio’s girlfriend.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remembered the feeling of the bile creeping up her throat as Rio arrived looking devastatingly handsome in a tailored dark green suit, Wanda attached to her right arm dressed in a slightly paler green silk dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Pulled from her thoughts, Agatha whipped her head around to see the rest of the group now looking at her with different expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen who was sitting back on the couch, arms crossed had one eye brow raised and a smug smile on her face, next to Alice who looked like Agatha was ready to bolt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy and Lilia both gave her a shared sympathetic look, and Rio looked straight at her, into her soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     Forcing her eyes away from the intense brown eyes, she replaced her mask.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” She huffed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We were just asking if you remembered to bring the pictures we asked?” Billy murmured shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had always hoarded photographs, the group had always made fun of her for not relying on digital photo’s, instead opting for the old school method of prints. ‘They’re timeless’ she would retort.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, yeah, they’re in my suitcase. I found some real cute one of you Jenny Kale. Remember your bowl cut phase?” Agatha teased the other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen’s face fell as Alice snorted and Lilia let out a loud chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You wouldn’t” Jen growled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha plastered a smug grin on her face as she shrugged her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Too late.”
     <br/>
     The group laughed lightly as the conversation changed to plans for the weekend.
     <br/>
     “Hey Rio, did you bring your board?” Alice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You bet, haven’t been on it in a while but I’m sure I can still shred some waves.” Rios eyes lit up as a smug smile crossed her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey Alice, could I try your board this time? Rio’s board hates me.” Billy asked excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     All the women burst out laughing while Alice looked at Billy flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Dude, the board doesn’t hate you, the waves hate you. You almost died last time, no way are we letting you back out there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh come on, that was years ago!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah Teen, let it go, you will never be allowed back into the water without a floatie on my watch.” Agatha said sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Careful Agatha, people might think you care.” Jen shot with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy blushed at the remark, Agatha had always looked out for him quietly and if it was insinuated that she did Agatha would bite their head off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “As if.” She scoffed.
    </p>
    <p>
     The patio door opening pulled the groups attention as Wanda finally joined them, greeting the rest of the group she hadn’t seen yet in a tight embrace individually.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had changed from her travel clothes into a crisp light sundress.
    </p>
    <p>
     She placed a blanket on Rio’s lap without a word and made her way to the vacant chair beside Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched as Rio rolled her eyes but smoothed out the blanket over lower half.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha arched her eyebrow, it was 70 degrees with a slight breeze, hardly chilly enough for a blanket. Rio had always ran warm too, it used to be a running joke between them, where Agatha was always cold, Rio would envelope her to heat her up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We were just talking about the time Billy almost died surfing out here.” Alice said to Wanda as she settled into her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh? I haven’t heard this one?” Wanda said with a curious smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Alice began to tell Wanda the story, Agatha’s eyes stuck on Rio, glaring at the blanket wrapped around her like it had personally insulted her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked bone tired.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her usual glow had dimmed and her eyes betrayed the false smile she would occasionally throw up as she joined in the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it the afternoon yet?” Lilia asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted, before quickly recovering as a blush crept up her face, her eyes instantly finding Rio’s staring back at her with a warm smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lilia, its 11:30am just go open the wine.” Jen drawled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Never. I’m not a morning drinker. I’ll wait.” Lilia said tilting her head slightly earning an eye roll from Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I am a morning, noon and night drinker so I will open the wine.”  Agatha said, pushing herself off the railing and making her way to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she passed by Rio’s chair, she felt a hand grasp her wrist stopping her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pour me one?” Soft brown eyes looked up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt the electricity shoot through her arm at the lightly calloused fingers gripping her wrist. Her mind hazing over before she shook her head slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Since when do you drink wine?” Agatha blurted out, instantly regretting it. She hadn’t been close to Rio in years, for all she knew, Wanda had dragged her to some wine tasting event where she’d fallen in love with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Red wine is supposed to be good for you. So I hear.” Rio replied smirking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course, that was always what Agatha had told everyone when she poured herself a generous amount of the maroon liquid.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio…” Wanda interjected with a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both Agatha and Rio’s eyes snapped to the other woman who was looking at Rio with a cautious stare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? Im on vacation, I’m allowed to indulge a little.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow as her eyes flickered between the two women yet again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thats quite a tight leash you have there Wanda, I had no idea you two were into that sort of thing.” She quipped as she made her way through the house to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Busying herself with pouring the wine, she hadn’t noticed Lilia sneak in behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your holding it together well.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus Lilia! We need to get you a bell.” Agatha yelped as a little wine spilled on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Im fine.”Agatha said as she mopped up the spilled wine with paper towels, avoiding Lilia’s knowing stare.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I’m a republican” Lilia said sarcastically, earning a glare from the younger woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Somethings not right with Rio.” Lilia said bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You noticed it too?” Agatha said
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia nodded slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I notice everything darling. You know that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She did know. She knew Lilia had watched Agatha pine over Rio since college, never probing too much but always giving her that look like she knew how deeply in love with her best friend she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was shocked when she invited me here. We haven’t exactly been on good terms.” Agatha said, picking up a wine glass and rolling the stem between her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “As was I. That was the first alarm bell that something wasn’t right.” Lilia said as she walked over, picking up the other glass Agatha had poured, intended for Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She seems… different. Smaller almost.” Agatha whispered, not really intending Lilia to hear as she replaced the wine Lilia had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia hummed in agreement, the only acknowledgement that she had heard the younger woman, before making her way back out onto the terrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha followed, handing Rio the wine glass, before meeting Wanda’s eye with a slight smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was pathetic, trying to one up the other woman but Agatha couldn’t help it, she was competitive at heart. And her heart cried out for what Wanda had claimed from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well I don’t know about you land-lovers but that water is calling me, babe let’s go for a swim?” Alice said standing from the couch, extending her hand out to Jen expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen pursed her lips and rolled her eyes before smiling and taking her wife’s hand pulling her up from the couch.
     <br/>
     “Don’t forget your swim cap Jen” Agatha called as they retreated, earning a finger flip from the buzzcut woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bald is beautiful.” Wanda said quietly, looking directly at Agatha with a steady gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed a laugh before noticing the hard look Wanda was giving her, silencing her as she observed the look in the redheads eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Every time she had ever met Wanda she would roll her eyes at how soft she seemed, now looking at her, she could tell something had shifted within her, gone was the whimsical ease the woman normally oozed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cleared her throat, shifting in her seat as she placed the  untouched wine down on the table beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think the water sounds like a good idea actually, Billy you up for a swim?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I use your board?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy rolled his eyes and threw his arms up dramatically, “Fine! I’ll just go get changed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at the other women, she knew Agatha and Lilia avoided the water every time so didn’t plan on inviting them, or listening to Agatha complain about the effect of the salt water on her long hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     She seemed to linger before looking at Wanda, who had already rose from her chair and was making her way down to the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha studied Rio’s face, watching as it fell when Wanda walked away from them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Everything okay there?” Lilia asked tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes snapped up, her eyes deliberately avoiding Agatha as she nodded quickly, “Yeah, she’s fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio slipped through the patio doors leaving Agatha and Lilia to share a quiet confused look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, that doesn’t seem fine to me.” Lilia said, draining the last of her wine before standing and reaching for the glass Rio had left.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It’s none of our business Lilia.” Agatha said unconvincingly as she rapped her fingers against the glass, her face scrunched in thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They are in separate rooms.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?!” Agatha almost yelled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Knew that would get your attention.” Lilia smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Agatha could probe any further, Alice and Jen reappeared, Alice in a black bikini with board shorts and Jen in a very revealing pink two piece.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m gonna grab my board from the car.” Alice said, pecking Jen on the lips as she made her way around the side of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen made her way down towards where Wanda stood, letting the waves lap at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, you not coming in?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe later, I’m just enjoying the calm for now.” Wanda said, looking out into the horizon her eyes squinting against the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were joined by Alice, Billy and Rio who had made their way down towards the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy had covered himself in way too much sunscreen, making him look ghost like next to Rio whose olive skin peaked through the black short sleeved and short legged wet suit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where’s your board?” Alice asked as Rio approached.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes met Wanda’s briefly before shrugging “Im just enjoy the water for a bit, that old knee injury has been flaring up this week, last thing I need is for you guys to watch me wipe out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda smiled warmly before placing her hand on Rio’s upper arm and giving a small squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you” she whispered, quietly enough for only Rio to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio returned the smile, flashing a cheeky wink before wading into the water behind the rest of the group.
    </p>
    <p>
     After watching them from the shore for a few minutes, laughing at Rio and Billy’s attempt to dunk each other in the water, she made her way back up to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her smile faltering slightly as she approached Lilia and Agatha, crossing her arms as she climbed the stars to the terrace, bracing herself for the usual cold glare of Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she made it to the top stairs the pair halted their conversation and she noticed that instead of the usual dismissive look from Agatha, she was now looking at her with something that resembled pity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Should we call the coastguard?” Lilia said, pulling Wanda’s eyes to the older woman who was now looking a lot more relaxed and had a faint glow to her cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think we’re okay for now” Wanda laughed, glancing back at the group in the water before sitting in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     From where she was seated, her back was to the water, and her chair was directly facing Agatha, who was still regarding her with a curious look. It was giving Wanda a chill, she wasn’t used to anything other than distain from the other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was just telling Agatha about the new store.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, thats right,  how is everything? Im sorry we haven’t been to visit it yet Lilia, things have been kind of crazy lately.” Wanda said avoiding both women’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha noticed how Wanda had shrunk down at the end of her statement, her eyes falling to the floor as she worried her bottom lip between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh nonsense dear, you and Rio can come by anytime. I must ask though, is everything alright? You dont’ quite seem yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s face showed panic as she straightened herself in the chair, not looking at Lilia who had asked the question, instead her eyes snapped up to Agatha first, holding her look for a beat, before smiling and waving her hand absentmindedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Everything’s fine. You know how Rio is, she can be a handful.” She said fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can say that again, it looks more like that boards riding her today” Agatha laughed as her eyes looked beyond Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s eyes widened as the colour drained from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What!?” She gasped, shooting up from her chair and whipping around to face the beach, before cursing and running back down the stairs towards the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha and Lilia both shared a started look at the other woman’s reaction.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the fuck was that?” Agatha asked as she stood to follow Wanda, Lilia trailing behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda ran the short distance towards the water, her eyes tracking Rio atop the surf board her body shaking as she caught one of the waves before crashing hard into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     The laughs and whoops from the rest of the group in the water rang out, Wanda was almost at the waters edge when the laughter died out, to be replaced with cries of panic as Rio had yet to surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice!” Wanda screamed as waded quickly into the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice, who was already swimming at pace to where Rio had fallen in, called out to her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha and Lilia had now joined them at the edge of the water, Lilia gripping onto Agatha’s arm, pulling her back as they watched the scene unfold.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breathing stopped, her body screaming to run as fast as possible to get to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, please, please” she prayed, her eyes scanning the water, watching as Wanda swam frantically to where Alice had disappeared in search for Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     After what seemed like an eternity, Alice surfaced, Rio’s limp form clutched closely to her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a small cry of relief at the sight, her body moving as she waded into the water to meet them as they collectively dragged Rio to the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God dammit Rio!” Wanda cried as she crouched over her wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice, the only one trained in first aid as a police officer immediately began CPR on her friend, pushing everyone out the way.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice! Please!” Agatha cried as she watched in terror as Alice began chest compressions on an unresponsive Rio, her knees buckling as Lilia tried to keep her upright.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy stood whimpering as Jen wrapped her arms around him, shock overtaking her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Breathe baby, just breathe” Wanda pleased
    </p>
    <p>
     As soon as Alice had performed two rescue breaths, the gurgling sound of water crept up Rio’s throat as she successfully expelled the water in her lungs, her coughing drowned out by the cries and shouting of relief from the group hovering over her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked her eyes opened rapidly, taking in the sight of the tear stained worried faces in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did I just pull a Billy?” She croaked out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was the only person who seemed to find that funny as she let out a soft laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Looking around the group, her eyes landed on Wanda, her eyes streaming with tears as her lip wobbled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Vidal I could kill you right this fucking instant!” Agatha yelled, pulling her gaze towards the blazing blue eyes as she took in Agatha’s soaked bottom half, her legs folded underneath her as her arms still clung onto a standing Lilia, who was looking equally as pale.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the hell happened out there dude? Ive never seen you lose your balance on such a tame wave” Alice asked softly as she helped Rio sit up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Wanda as she took her other arm across from Alice as they helped her slowly stand, her green eyes pleading with her silently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s just get back to the house huh?” Rio sighed, supported by Alice and Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood as the trio passed them, her questioning eyes meeting Wanda’s as she read the worried expression on her face. Even though Rio was no longer in mortal danger, the concern in Wanda’s features hadn’t eased.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time everyone had gotten changed out their wet clothes and calmed down slightly, the sun had began to sink lower in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had retreated to her room to pull herself together, her mind replayed the haunting images of Rio’s limp body being pulled from the water, her breath catching painfully in her throat as her body trembled at the thought of what might have happened if they hadn’t arrived in time. She couldn’t afford to lose Rio. Though Rio wasn’t hers, she couldn’t bear a world in which Rio’s voice, laughter, and presence were forever absent from her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice had taken it upon herself to Start up the grill, a job that Rio usually would insist on but didn’t seem to have the fight left in her to challenge her friend.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they gathered back onto the terrace, drinks began to flow as the tension slowly eased from the earlier event.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had been the quietest of the group, busying herself with cleaning around the house, avoiding any and all conversations.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had attempted to make some jokes, only to be given glares of her wife each time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So now that I’m no longer the shark bait of the group does that mean I can get some board action tomorrow?” Billy joked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I still wanna know what the hell happened out there, there’s no way Rio Vidal wiped out on a wave like that” Alice said half seriously as she turned the burgers on the grill.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told you, my knee has been a bitch…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio! For God sake will you just tell them.” Wanda snapped, silencing everyone as they looked between the two women.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at Rio questioningly, “Tell us what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just wanted to enjoy a couple of days without everyone looking at me or treating me differently.” Rio said as she looked down at the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does this have something to do with you and Wanda having separate rooms?” Jen asked pointing between the two as Alice abandoned the grill and took a seat beside Lilia and Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched, as she watched Rio and Wanda exchange a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda walked over and sat on the arm of the chair Rio was sitting on giving her shoulder a light squeeze in silent encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I suppose thats a good place to start.” Rio glanced up from her clasped hands, her eyes finding Agatha’s searching blue eyes before continuing, focusing on her ocean blue eyes and clearing her throat as she started to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, Wanda and I are actually getting a divorce.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The group audibly gasped and Rio held up her hand before anyone could jump in with questions. Agathas internal voice was screaming. Divorce!?
    </p>
    <p>
     “We made the decision about 11 months ago, we’re just holding off on finalising it for now.” Rio’s voice broke on the last syllable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was in work about 6 months ago when I noticed my legs not working like they should, I took a couple of falls before Wanda dragged me to the doctor. “ she paused, taking a deep breath before continuing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “After a series of scans, I found out I had a pretty gnarly brain tumour, which I now refer to as Dave” Rio attempted to lighten the mood with humour that fell flat as she observed the devastated expressions of those she loved most.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ridiculous name” Wanda scoffed lightheartedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could see the heartbreak etched on each face, an inevitable outcome regardless of how she delivered the news.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze was pulled to Agatha. The sorrow in Agatha’s eyes was palpable, nearly overwhelming Rio. The woman, usually the epitome of strength and independence, appeared shattered and lost, her blue eyes brimming with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard against the emotion in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So… what are the doctors saying? Have you started treatment?” Jen’s voice wavered with concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, reluctantly shifting her focus from Agatha as Wanda offered a comforting squeeze to her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Chemo didn’t work, which was tough,” she admitted. “But I recently finished radiotherapy, and it’s shrunk Dave enough to consider surgery.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda couldn’t hold back a sob at Rio’s update.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is the surgery... dangerous?” Lilia inquired, her gaze darting to Wanda’s tense posture at the mention of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took another deep breath and responded quietly, “It’s um, 80/20.”

    <p>
     "Are you saying there's an 80% success rate?" Billy asked with a hopeful tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't reply verbally. Instead, she shook her head, her gaze fixed on the terrace floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And what if... what if you don't go through with the surgery?" Agatha's voice was shaky, barely more than a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hesitated, then looked up at Agatha, wishing she hadn’t when she saw Agatha's distressed expression. Tears were forming in Agatha’s eyes, and Rio noticed her hands trembling slightly in her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     "About a year, maybe, if I'm lucky," Rio whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sharply inhaled, dismissing the murmured concerns of others about the surgery's risks.
    </p>
    <p>
     "When is the surgery?" she asked abruptly, interrupting Lilia, who was explaining how statistics often present worst-case scenarios and aren't always accurate.
    </p>
    <p>
     The group fell silent, glancing at Agatha's determined stance before turning back to Rio, who was once again focused on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda rose silently from the arm of Rio’s chair and moved to the railing, her back tense as she looked out at the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You are going to have it, aren't you?" Agatha demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio remained silent, and the group exchanged anxious glances.
    </p>
    <p>
     "For God's sake, answer me, Rio!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flinched visibly, still avoiding eye contact with everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I haven't decided yet," she responded quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her in disbelief, letting out a bitter laugh as tears streamed down her face. She glanced around at the others, but no one met her gaze except Wanda, whose green eyes silently pleaded for support.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alice, the burgers are burning,” Rio announced matter-of-factly, jolting the group from their reverie. Alice leapt up, rushing to save the charred patties, with Billy shuffling behind her, wiping his eyes furiously with the sleeve of his sweatshirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think I’ll go open more wine,” Jen murmured, sounding dazed as she slowly rose from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia glanced between Agatha, Rio, and Wanda, then pushed herself off her seat to follow Jen into the house.
     <br/>
     “Let me help you with that,” she said, pausing beside Rio to gently cup her cheeks, lifting her face gently to meet her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No matter what you decide, remember we’re with you every step of the way,” Lilia assured, her thumb brushing away a stray tear from Rio's cheek, choosing to ignore Agatha's huffed response from behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled warmly in return, raising her hand to clasp Lilia's wrist, giving it a gentle squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Were you even going to tell m- us?” Agatha asked, her sharp tone dulled with grief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was, I just wanted to enjoy this weekend first”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What, one last hurrah before you leave me here!?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't respond.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, walk with me” Wanda said softly from behind Agathas chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked back at Rio who was avoiding her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha followed Wanda cautiously as they made their way down to the secluded stretch of beach. The sun hung low in the sky, casting a golden glow over the gentle waves.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda seemed lost in thought, her shoulders tense, her gaze fixed on the horizon. Agatha kept her distance, not quite sure what to say or do, feeling the growing knot of unease in her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Wanda broke the silence, her voice soft and wavering.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know, Rio’s always shown me love and affection,” she said, her eyes fixed on the surf. “She’s the kind of person who gives everything she has.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked down at her feet, considering Wanda’s words.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hadn’t spoken in a while, and now her voice was quieter, tinged with a hint of sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” she replied softly. “Rio’s always worn her heart on her sleeve. That’s one of the things I’ve always lo- admired about her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda turned slightly to look at Agatha, her expression strained.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I also know,” she said quietly,
    </p>
    <p>
     “That deep down, I know she’ll never see me the way she sees you. No matter what I do, or how much I wish for it… I just know I’ll never be enough for her in that way. I think I always knew, even before we were married. I guess I stupidly thought that would fade with time…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath hitched. For a moment, she hesitated, unsure whether to reveal her own feelings or to keep them buried.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, she just nodded solemnly as her mind whirled, Wanda must be mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But it doesn’t change the fact that she’s still my best friend, and I can’t shake this feeling that something’s waiting to be decided for her. She’s got a choice now, whether to go through that surgery or not…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s voice trembled as she admitted,
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I honestly believe, Agatha, you’re the only one who can get through to her. You need to talk to Rio. You’re the only person she might listen to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked in surprise, her brows furrowing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Me? Why? What makes you think she will-”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda interrupted gently, shaking her head with a sad smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because she trusts you, more than anyone. And I think… she loves you… more than she’s willing to admit. You’re the only one who might be able to make her see she’s got to fight this. She deserves a chance to fight for her life. I know that she feels a lot of guilt about what happened between us, I don’t want her to punish herself for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze, her heart pounding. Her mind raced, trying to reconcile Wanda’s words with what she couldnt grasp, Rio’s feelings for her. But she kept her expression calm, hiding her own turmoil.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll talk to her,” she said finally, voice steady, though her insides twisted with emotion. “I’ll try.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda looked at her with a mixture of hope and hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you,” she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just… please, talk to her. She needs to hear it from someone who loves her, not just as a friend, but as someone who cares enough to want her to stay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded again, feeling the weight of unspoken truths hanging between them. As they stood silently watching the waves crash, Agatha wondered if she truly could be the person to sway Rio, that she could reach through the layers of pride and uncertainty, and help her see the fight worth fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had retreated back to the house, Agatha stayed looking out at the horizon as the sun was setting beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t realise someone had joined her until she felt the shift in the sand beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t have to turn to know that person was Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was instantly wrapped in the scent of Rio, earthy with a hint of sandalwood.
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither spoke at first, the two women sat in the sand just quietly listening to the sound of the surf, the calm of the motion masking the inner turmoil happening within them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you remember the last time we were all here?” Rio spoke softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s shoulder’s tensed and her breathing hitched.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had thought about that trip everyday since.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was 5 years ago, Billy had just graduated college, the last of the group to do so, they had come to their favourite place to celebrate together.
    </p>
    <p>
     They hadn’t expected the weather to turn, forcing them indoors for most of the trip to avoid the rain.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha remembered how happy she had been, Rio and her had shared a room, and far too many drinks one night after everyone else had went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She remembered how Rio had leaned in slowly, Rio climbing onto her lap, Rio’s soft lips on her own, Rio’s hands combing through her long hair, everything had stopped in that moment as Agatha’s hands worshipped Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     She remembers how she woke up in the dead of night, Rio’s warm body entangled in her own as the fear ripped into her, too much, too close.
    </p>
    <p>
     She remembered the Uber quietly taking her away from Rio, the text message she had sent like a coward, brutal, false and void of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was a mistake.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The text that ended everything, what could have been.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had avoided Rio for months after that night.
    </p>
    <p>
     Persistent, unrelenting Rio, who would call her and she wouldn’t answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had told herself that she didn’t deserve her, that Rio was too good for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha poisoned everything she had ever touched. Her mother had made that clear early on in her life.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn’t do that to the one person in this world she truly loved.
    </p>
    <p>
     So she ran.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned to Rio beside her, only just noticing that the wetness on her cheeks were from her own tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t turn, she continued to look out at the rhythmic cascading of the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why’d you shut me out Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mouth opened to speak but nothing came out, just a small noise as the tears continued to fall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually Rio turned her head to face her.
    </p>
    <p>
     The hurt in Rio’s eyes was enough to end Agatha on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     For the first time that day she could see the vulnerability and fear written all over the other woman’s face, no bravado, no mask.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wasn’t good enough…I couldn’t. “
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes flashed briefly with anger, before shaking her head and looking down at the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Bullshit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave a confused look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You were scared. It was real and you were scared to admit it. I waited for you, I begged you to talk to me. You just vanished.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You married Wanda.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a sad defeated laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, I did. Wanda picked up my broken pieces, made it look easy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t help the bitter sting of jealousy that crept up her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had no right to resent Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had pretty much forced Rio into Wanda’s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s a good person. She really loves you Rio.” Agatha admitted quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another bitter laugh from Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time she didn’t have a response with it, she just nodded her head slowly looking back down where here fingers traced the sand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s… everything I’m not” Agatha whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio faced her again, absorbing every detail of Agatha’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thats the problem.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes locked, Agatha saw her own reflection in Rio’s warm brown gaze, tears hovering but refusing to fall, caught in the golden remnants of daylight.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I tried to move on. Truly, I did. I thought I could find happiness with Wanda. And for a while, I did. I loved her."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio paused, inhaling deeply and holding her breath momentarily. Agatha could see the struggle in her eyes, the pain etched across her features, her jaw tightening as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
     "But I couldn't let you go... and Wanda saw right through it."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha recalled her conversation with the ginger-haired woman, a moment of clarity echoing in her mind: ‘I know she'll never look at me the way she looks at you.’
    </p>
    <p>
     Guilt flooded over Agatha, seeping into her bones like cold rain, realising the pain her decisions had caused not only Rio but also Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had left to shield Rio, but in doing so, she shattered what fleeting happiness might have been possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her thoughts spun wildly, grappling with the emotional whirlwind of the day. All this time, she'd assumed Rio had moved on, found joy with Wanda, while she herself was slowly fading.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Am I too late?" Her voice was barely a whisper, raw and worn, as she reached to cover Rio's hand with her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hands paused in the sand, her shoulders falling as she looked back at Agatha with a melancholic smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I still have a little time," she replied softly, letting sand slip through her fingers, a reflection of time slipping away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck no. You're having that surgery. Then we can talk."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Agatha..."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Don't. You can't just lay this all out and expect it to end at a deadline. I've waited too long to lose you again."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced down at Agatha's hand gripping hers, her thumb gently caressing Agatha’s knuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It's not that simple. If I don’t have the surgery, I'll have a few months to live, to find closure, make peace."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Is that what this is?" Agatha shot back, motioning between them. "Am I just unfinished business, something you wanted off your conscience before...?" Anger propelled her to her feet, her hands flung up in exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up, mouth slightly open, her eyes pleading. She slowly rose, swaying, and Agatha instinctively moved to steady her but stopped short when Rio raised her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I'd rather have a few months with you than nothing," she said softly, her honesty piercing through.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught as tears brimmed, spilling forth.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Please, Rio. Fight for us. Fight for me."
    </p>
    <p>
     "I did fight... five years ago."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stepped nearer, her trembling hand reaching for Rio’s cheek, anticipating a retreat, but Rio leaned into her touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I won't run. I won't leave. I’m here, in whatever way you need me to be.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They lingered in the moment, still and silent, eyes locked as the sunset painted the sky in hues of gold and scarlet.

    <p>
     Wanda stood on the terrace, a gentle smile playing on her lips as she brushed away a stray tear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sure, the burgers are a bit crispy, but they’re still good,” Billy said with a grin as he joined her, offering a plate with a slightly charred burger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda chuckled through her tears. “Thanks, Billy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you okay?” he asked, glancing towards Agatha and Rio on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda didn’t answer immediately, her gaze fixed on the two women as they made their way back to the house. “I’ve made my peace with it,” she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy frowned, puzzled by her words, but before he could respond, Agatha and Rio arrived on the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously Alice, you had one job…” Rio teased, eyeing Wanda’s plate with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey! I’m blaming you for the distraction asshole!” Alice retorted with a grin, as Rio moved to inspect the rest of the food on the grill.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stopped next to Wanda. Billy glanced between the two women before quietly moving toward the grill, muttering about tongs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood awkwardly beside Wanda, folding her arms and leaning against the railing, her back to the sea. “Thank you,” she said, clearing her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda turned slightly, her eyes meeting Agatha’s briefly before Agatha looked away. “For taking care of her. I know it couldn’t have been easy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sure she’d do the same for me if our roles were reversed. Have you been able to reach her yet?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed, feeling torn. She had always disliked Wanda, had shuddered at the thought of her. But now, she admired Wanda so much it was hard not to like her. “Not yet, but I’m not giving up. Even if I have to drag her there myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda laughed. “That’s exactly what I expected.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone buzzed, and she glanced at the caller ID with a soft smile. “Excuse me, I should take this.” She walked down to the beach, her cheeks tinged with a little blush as she spoke into the phone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice, there’s no way you can lift me—I’m like three feet taller than you!” Agatha turned to see Alice attempting to lift Billy over her shoulder while Rio doubled over in laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     At the seating area, Lilia swayed slightly, clearly having enjoyed the wine, as she listened to Jen talk animatedly about her skincare line.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha soaked in the tranquility of the moment. She had missed this. She had missed them all.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A laugh echoed behind Agatha from the beach as she turned to see Wanda laughing, engrossed in the conversation with the mystery caller.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I haven’t seen her laugh like that in a long time.” Rio’s voice came from behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was watching Wanda with a fond smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She thinks I don’t know, but she’s been seeing my physical therapist Natalie for a few weeks.” Rio said with a mischievous smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And… you’re okay with that?” Agatha asked cautiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged and smiled, “She deserves to be happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted a laugh, earning a confused look from Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Whats so funny?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s dating her soon to be ex wife’s doctor. Its all so very lesbian.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The two women burst out laughing, leaning into each other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt like she was back in college, her and Rio laughing until their side’s hurt, the lingering touches they shared before it became awkward.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As the sun disappeared, the group sat huddled round an enclosed fire pit on the patio, Alice and Jen shared a blanket on the rattan couch, Billy sat on the floor closest to the fire, Rio sat dozing slightly on a chair wrapped in the blanket Wanda had fetched earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda was in the kitchen pulling orange bottles of pills out of a bag when Agatha joined her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are those all for Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda jumped slightly, turning with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, it’s pretty intimidating. If I don’t keep track of them she’ll never remember which ones to take.” She breathed a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stepped up closer, picking up one of the bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Show me.” She said her eyes meeting Wanda’s, her face determined.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda looked up, shocked at first before smiling softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda methodically showed Agatha which pills Rio took, the dosage, what they did, what she could take with food and without, the side effects Rio sometimes had and the pills used to counter said side effects.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha listened intently, her heart aching as Wanda described the physical toll each medication had on Rio, the pain she had endured and the resilience Wanda had shown the past 6 months.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why don’t you give her the dose this time. Im going to head up to bed, its been a long day.” Wanda said handing Agatha the little plastic container with 3 pills and bottle of water.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took the container and water off Wanda as she bid her goodnight, watching as she retreated up the stairs, waiting until she was out of sight before putting the water bottle back in the fridge and pulling out a chilled bottle of modelo, smirking as she done so.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sure she wanted to keep Rio healthy, but she also knew Rio better than anyone and the best way to make the medicine go down was one of Rio’s favourite beers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sauntering out onto the patio, greeted with Lilia’s rendition of I Dreamed a Dream while Billy sat enraptured, Jen was rolling her eyes as Alice was passed out with her head on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was a little more awake, a far-off look in her eyes and a soft smile on her face as she watched Lilia hit the high notes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grimaced as soon as she stepped out, theatrically rolling her eyes at the older woman’s constant need for a drunken show tune.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sitting in the chair next to Rio she handed her the container of pills before pulling the beer from behind her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “To soften the blow. Don’t tell the wife.” She winked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes lit up as soon as the beer was placed in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha picked up her wine from the table as she side eyed Rio to make sure the pills had been taken, washed down with the cold beer.
    </p>
    <p>
     She watched as Rio’s eyes closed softly and a small hum escaped her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually the rest of the group retired to Bed leaving just Agatha and Rio on the patio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The night settled softly around them, the gentle hush of the ocean forming a rhythmic backdrop to their solitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha and Rio sat in a silence that was both comforting and fraught with unsaid words.
    </p>
    <p>
     The crackling of the fire occasionally erupted like distant fireworks, casting dancing shadows across a scene almost cinematic in its intimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced at the flames, their light playing warmly across her features, casting an ephemeral glow that shifted with each flicker.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her chest felt heavy with sentiments that had lingered unspoken for too long, anticipation thrumming like a taut string.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hesitated, the words heavy on her tongue, before she finally released them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish I had been there for you,” she whispered, her voice barely rising above the soothing lull of the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     The fire reflected in her eyes, a bright echo of the emotion she could no longer contain. It felt like a confession, fragile and sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio remained silent, the longing in Agatha’s voice unraveling gently around her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was captivated not just by the words, but by the sincerity they carried.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's next words came stronger, carrying a promise laced with the unbending fortitude of someone who cared deeply:
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to be here for you from now on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha…” Rio sighed, her voice a soft exhale of uncertainty and gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     The single name spoke volumes of shared history and an undeniable bond once lost to time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved with determination, setting her glass on the table before kneeling beside Rio's chair. Her hands found the armrest, a touch that anchored both of them to the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze met Rio’s, eyes that were pools of emotion that had long been held back but now brimmed with a palpable urgency.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean it,” she reiterated, her voice steadied by the gravity of her commitment.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If …when you have this surgery, Rio, I want to be there with you. I want to be the first thing you see when you wake up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio attempted to deflect, a small, wry smile ghosting her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If I wake up...” she joked, the words lacking their usual levity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop it,” Agatha snapped, her voice cracking like glass under pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rawness of her tone cut through the banter, wiping any hint of a smile from Rio's face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her vulnerability was startling, her defiance fuelled by love and fear entwined.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’ll wake up,” Agatha insisted, the conviction in her voice brooking no argument.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I’ll be there waiting when you do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The intensity of the moment caught in the air around them, the space between them charged with unspoken promises and the weight of what could be. Rio's breath paused, her throat tightening as the truth in Agatha’s eyes mirrored her own silent hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Promise?” Rio’s question was fragile, a plea and a hope wrapped into a single, breathless word.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took Rio's hand, her grip firm and reassuring, as if willing the bond between them to hold back the tide of uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cross my heart,” she vowed, her voice a solemn pledge that echoed in the silent night, binding them closer than ever before.

    <p>
     As the two women sat huddled on the shadowed patio, the rhythmic whisper of the ocean provided a soothing backdrop, while the gentle crackle of the fire pit cast a warm, flickering glow on their faces. Above them, the stars shone brilliantly, twinkling like distant jewels in the night sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced over at Rio, noticing her slight shiver even beneath the thick blanket enveloping her.  Another reminder of the physical change ‘Dave’ was inflicting on Rio, who no longer ran hot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We should call it a night, it’s getting late,” Swallowing the lump in her throat Agatha suggested softly, rising slowly from her chair, hesitant to disturb the tranquility of the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
     "You go ahead, I’m ok here," Rio replied in a gentle voice, her eyes looking up into the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated before grabbing another blanket from a nearby chair, tenderly she wrapped it around the other woman, tucking the ends in and making sure she was comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she bent over, her hair fell over her shoulder, brushing the side of Rio’s cheek as she watched her eyes close and a small smile form on her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lavender.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hands paused fussing with the blanket as she looked up to meet Rio’s brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ive avoided lavender scented everything for five years you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha couldn’t speak, her voice evading her as her throat constricted, her hands still placed on the blanket over Rio’s upper arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s mind reeled, Rio’s eyes locked on her own, she could feel Rio’s breath against her face, her hands slowly began to move towards Rio’s face as her eyes flickered to Rio’s soft lips, before she knew it she was slowly leaning in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, Rio’s eyes diverted from Agatha’s lips, her eyes widened slightly as she cleared her throat and blinked rapidly as she shifted in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think maybe I should call it a night after all.” As she began to untangle from the cocoon of blankets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hands snapped back as if she had been burned. Running a hand through her thick hair, she turned her back to Rio, steadying her breath and willing away the tears that had began to form.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cursed herself silently.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good night Agatha.” She heard as Rio opened the screen door of the patio, footsteps receding into the house before Agatha could reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned and stared at the patio door before leaning her head back to look up at the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you looking at?” She whispered harshly, scowling at the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha slipped into her lilac silk tank top with matching sleep shorts, she lay atop the covers, gazing at the wooden panels of the ceiling. The silence of the night enveloped her, pressing in from all sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind was a whirlwind of the day's events.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was sick.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was divorced (almost).
    </p>
    <p>
     How fucking dare the universe screw her like this.
    </p>
    <p>
     She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to stave off the tears threatening to fall for what felt like the millionth time that day. Her chest yearned to sob, her jaw clenched tightly to hold back a scream.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she fully realised it, her body was moving, pulling her from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     To Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Quietly, she pushed the door open and tiptoed down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly easing open the door to Rio’s room, she found Rio already asleep under the covers, her breaths slow and steady. Moonlight gently illuminated the soft contours of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a sense of calm as she observed the rhythmic rise and fall of Rio’s chest, the peaceful look gracing her features.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had promised Rio that she would always be there for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She intended to keep that promise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Though every fibre of her being longed to crawl under the covers and hold her, to breathe in Rio’s familiar earthy scent, the memory of Rio pulling away earlier held her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, she lingered in the doorway, watching each breath Rio took- each inhale, each exhale.
    </p>
    <p>
     As long as Rio was breathing, Agatha could breathe too.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio woke the next morning, the soft tapping on the door roused her first as she groaned, refusing to open her eyes until she felt the dip in the bed beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Squinting one eye open she tried to focus on the person who had pulled her from her dreams, eventually finding the auburn hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had always been a morning person, completely opposite from Rio who would sleep until mid day at any given chance.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning” Wanda’s soft voice came.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed in response, her throat too dry to formulate any words yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda chuckled lightly as she watched Rio begin to find her bearings, helping her to sit up slightly against the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced at the table beside her, taking in the new additions of a water bottle, pills and a familiar bright green liquid in a tall glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I made your smoothie, and your 8am meds are there too, you can have the 9am ones after breakfast.” She said in a practiced tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m still convinced the smoothie is just your secret way of torturing me.” She said, side-eyeing the accused drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda rolled her eyes fondly with a small smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not true, research shows that the natural vitamins and minerals in kale and spinach can-“
    </p>
    <p>
     “Drastically reduce tumour cell growth. I know, I know.” She smiled back at Wanda before reaching out and clasping her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you Wanda, really.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda lightly squeezed her hand in return, offering a tight lipped smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I, uh, actually wanted to talk to you about something.” Rio said nervously, reaching for the water bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh?” Wanda said, raising her eyebrow curiously and shifting further onto the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a swig of the water bottle, her eyes looking everywhere except Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up, biting her lip nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I uh… invited Natalie to join us, she’ll be here later today.” She said, squeezing one eye closed and peeking at Wanda with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s body visibly tensed as her eyes widened comically, her lips parted as she stared at Rio in shock.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You what? How did- when?” Wanda stuttered, rising from the bed and beginning to pace the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I saw how happy you were last night when she called. I called her a little after that and asked if she wanted to come join us. Join you. She was more than happy to come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You had no right Rio!” Wanda roared, pointing her finger furiously.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You deserve to be happy too Wanda! I cant watch as you slowly kill yourself trying to take care of me all the time. It’s not fair. I cant … I cant leave without knowing you’re okay.” Rio said her lip trembling slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s anger melted away at Rio’s admission, her eyes instantly welling with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly she sat back down on the edge of the bed, wiping away the tear that had escaped down her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Damn you Vidal.” Wanda sniffed, “I wish you wouldn’t talk like that.” Her eyes focused on the bed, picking at a loose thread on the bed sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know. But I have to be realistic too. I mean it Wanda, you have been there for me for so long, let someone else be there for you now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda looked up from the loose thread and into Rio’s shining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How long have you known?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh are you kidding? I saw the way you both giggled around each other my first appointment.” Rio laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda blushed profusely, picking up one of Rio’s pillows and smacking her lightly with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No you don’t.” Rio smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda sighed loudly, shaking her head and breathing out a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No but I’m getting close. Drink your smoothie.” Wanda said rising from the bed and making her way to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she reached the door she turned back smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled softly in return.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re welcome. Now if I were you I would go sort out that bed hair before Nat gets here and see’s it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda barked a laugh as she left the room, flipping off Rio before disappearing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched with a small smile as Wanda left, eyeing the green drink on the table next to her before scrunching her face in disgust.

    <p>
     Agatha had spent most of the night tossing and turning. Now, the lively sounds of the group from downstairs made her groan in frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
     She futilely pulled her pillow over her head, hoping to steal just a little more sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     How could a bunch of adults create such a commotion this early in the morning? She fumbled for her phone to check the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     11:35 a.m.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, perhaps it wasn’t so early after all.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a resigned sigh, Agatha reluctantly dragged herself out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Stretching, she made her way toward the shower, aware that being the last to shower in the charming yet flawed beach house likely meant no hot water awaited her.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha approached the bathroom door, it swung open, revealing the looming figure of the creature from the black lagoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh my GOD!!!" Agatha shrieked, instinctively jumping back against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What!!?" the creature shrieked back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Blinking the sleep from her eyes, Agatha realised who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lilia?! What the fuck is on your face?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Oh, just Jen's new concoction: oatmeal, charcoal, and something else I can't quite remember. It does wonders for a hangover, you should give it a try," Lilia replied as she breezed past Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, trying to steady her racing heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I'm definitely wide awake now," she grumbled, heading into the bathroom and slamming the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After showering, Agatha towel-dried her hair, the damp waves cascading down her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     She slipped into a purple bikini and tossed on a long white button-up shirt for modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she descended the final step into the lounge, her jaw dropped. Jen had transformed the downstairs into a makeshift spa, with the rest of the group in varying stages of beauty treatments.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy lounged on the sofa, his feet encased in plastic bags draped over the armrest, while Wanda sat in an armchair, a face mask being applied.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside on the patio, Lilia, covered in her oatmeal mixture, animatedly chatted with Alice and Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice looked particularly striking, sporting a phantom-of-the-opera-esque mask that emitted a red glow.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Are you sure this will get rid of the darkness around my eyes?" Wanda asked nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Trust. An hour with this and you'll feel like a new person," Jen assured her, adding more of the concoction.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha muttered under her breath, making her way to the kitchen, her focus on the coffee machine. Opening cabinet doors, she barked, "Where's the coffee?"
    </p>
    <p>
     "Did you bring any?" Jen called back.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No! Someone else always brings it!"
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen merely hummed in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stormed back into the lounge, glaring at Jen, Billy, and Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Seriously? No coffee? What am I supposed to do?"
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda, beneath her mask, opened one eye.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I brought some green tea with peach. It has caffeine too."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha feigned a gag, then marched out to the patio.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     "Lilia! Tell me you've got coffee."
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia paused mid-gesture, caught in her conversation with Rio and Alice.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, darling, just dried tea leaves."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned to Alice, who merely shrugged, her expression obscured by the LED mask.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Jen and I brought matcha."
    </p>
    <p>
     "Urgh!" Agatha threw her hands up dramatically and flopped onto a vacant chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, Agatha cast a sideways glance at Rio, who sat watching her theatrics with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't help but notice how Rio's eyes widened as they roamed over the expanse of her bare thighs, sending a delightful shiver down her spine.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No point in asking you. Still got the palate of a five-year-old, I take it?" she teased, trying to conceal the warmth blossoming inside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned broadly, her gap-toothed smile as endearing as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt her heart flutter; Rio was an adorable idiot who always managed to get under her skin in the best way possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Idiot." Agatha scowled, though her heart was secretly melting.
    </p>
    <p>
     She couldn't deny the pull of her unspoken affection.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I did not sign up for a decaf weekend with Kale cosmetics,” she huffed, crossing her arms over her chest in mock defiance, hoping Rio wouldn't notice how flustered she felt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don’t worry, Agatha, you are a lost cause. Even I couldn’t fix your mug,” Jen called from the lounge.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s because I’m exceptional!” Agatha replied, raising her hand with dramatic flair.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Can I take these things off my feet yet?" Billy groaned from the couch, clearly uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
     "No, just ten more minutes," Jen insisted with a satisfied grin. "I refuse to look at those crusty toes all weekend. Trust me, the foot mask will make them look like new."
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced at Rio, who was casually nestled in a chair, her hair cascading over her shoulders, dressed in an oversized T-shirt and board shorts.
    </p>
    <p>
     "How did you manage to escape this?" Agatha asked with a playful lilt, trying to ignore the flutter in her chest whenever she looked at Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I have cancer," Rio replied with a smirk, an unfazed air in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's heart clenched at Rio's calm demeanour over her serious plight. Her mask of composure slipped for a moment, her worry showing before she quickly adjusted it to a gentle smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Touché," she responded softly, her affection cloaked in a playful reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze remained locked with Rio's, creating a lingering connection as the rest of the group's conversation faded into the background.
    </p>
    <p>
     In that fleeting moment, it was as if the world around them disappeared, leaving only the unspoken words hovering between them, with the depth of emotion in Rio's eyes speaking volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as her lips parted, her heart was pleading with her to say all the unspoken words that had built up over the years, apologies for leaving, for being too scared to admit there was something there.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you feeling today?” She asked softly, pushing her emotions to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes traced the lines etched in Rio’s face, the light had dimmed in her eyes with exhaustion and her energy levels were no where near what Agatha was so used to seeing in her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced at Agatha with a gentle smile. "I feel good today."
    </p>
    <p>
     "And you look amazing," Lilia replied, rising to wash off her face mask. As she passed Rio, she gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Beautiful" Agatha whispered, quiet enough that only Rio could hear, earning a small blush and genuine smile from the other woman.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     After everyone completed their Kale Care treatments, the group gathered on the sun-drenched patio, settling comfortably into their familiar routines. Lilia busied herself preparing her renowned Greek salad while Agatha and Jen engaged in light-hearted banter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nearby, Alice and Billy animatedly discussed the latest in music trends, and Wanda lent a hand to Lilia in the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took it all in with a heart full of gratitude, savouring the rarity of such a serene moment, a blessed pause from months of chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
     There were no doctors with probing questions, no daunting treatment plans looming over her, just the pure, unhurried joy of being present with friends.
    </p>
    <p>
     She allowed herself to exist solely in the present, refusing to let thoughts of the approaching surgery and its risks intrude on her peace.
    </p>
    <p>
     In her mind, she captured this scene, a precious memory to draw on for strength during the challenging days ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes drifted to where Agatha lay sprawled elegantly on the sun lounger, her arms stretching languidly above her head, the crisp white button-up shirt now fully undone to reveal her bikini-clad figure basking in the sun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip, her thoughts slipping back to that unforgettable night five years prior.
    </p>
    <p>
     She remembered Agatha’s fingers entangled in her hair, the gentle yet fervent way she tugged on Rio's bottom lip during their kisses, as if she were starved for her touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Heat crept up Rio’s neck as she reluctantly looked away from the woman who had lingered in her thoughts for nearly two decades.
    </p>
    <p>
     Countless times, she replayed that night in her mind, endlessly reconstructing scenarios in an attempt to understand why Agatha had abruptly vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now here she was, back in Rio’s life, promising to stay, promising to never leave again. The words hung in the air, heavy with unspoken vows and tentative hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had loved Agatha for as long as she could remember.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t just a passing infatuation, it was a deep, consuming affection rooted in every shared moment, every whispered secret.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s dark humour, her sharp wit, and her abrasive attitude that no one else seemed to understand or appreciate only made her more captivating in Rio’s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Those unpredictable, fiery sides of Agatha drew her in even more, but what truly endeared her to Rio was the rare vulnerability that she often kept hidden beneath her tough exterior.
    </p>
    <p>
     When it was just the two of them alone, away from the world’s judgment, Agatha would let her guard down.
    </p>
    <p>
     The snarky retorts softened into gentle, clingy affection, small gestures that revealed how deeply she cared.
     <br/>
     Those quiet moments, filled with shared silence and stolen touches, were the ones Rio cherished most.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, torn between conflicting fears and hopes, she felt her heart clash within her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She longed to confess everything, to lay bare her love and declare that she wanted Agatha by her side forever. Every fibre of her being yearned to make that promise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet, the shadow of doubt lingered, was it selfish to hope for eternity when her time might be so limited?
    </p>
    <p>
     If she chose to forgo the surgery, she could attempt to savour what remained of her life with her best friends, creating memories and embracing the fleeting moments of happiness they had left.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a bittersweet choice, filled with the thrill of living fully in the present but haunted by the knowledge of her inevitable departure.
    </p>
    <p>
     But if she decided to go ahead with the surgery, there was a slim chance, a fragile hope that she could stay longer, perhaps even hold a future she once thought impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet, that choice came with a painful risk, would she be willing to gamble with Agatha’s heart?
     <br/>
     Would she be prepared to leave her behind if the worst were to happen?
     <br/>
     The thought of causing her pain or heartbreak for the slim possibility of more time was almost unbearable.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a cruel dilemma, to protect the woman she loved from potential heartbreak, or to pursue her own desire for a lifetime together, no matter the cost.
    </p>
    <p>
     And as she sat there, caught between hope and despair, she realised that whichever choice she made, her love for Agatha was the only certainty she knew.
    </p>
    <p>
     The storm of thoughts and emotion taking up energy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could feel her body reacting to the emotional stress instantly, her body sagged as her vision blurred. She was used to this by now, she could wake up feeling like nothing was wrong and suddenly feel like she had been drained of every ounce of energy in her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her limbs didn’t work when she asked them to, her eyes could lose focus as she blinked to regain control of her sight as the world began to turn dark, her fingers tingled like jolts of electricity was tickling them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha who had been glancing back at Rio frequently, instantly rose from the lounger when she noticed the change in Rio’s posture and the sudden scrunch of her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio? Whats wrong?” Agatha’s muffled voice found Rio’s ears as her body sagged back onto the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda!” Came Alice’s voice now as Rio attempted to focus on the blurred figures standing in front of her, her limbs twitching involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda appeared in an instant, taking note of the panic in Agatha’s face before approaching Rio switfly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "It’s okay, we’re here, Rio. You’re safe," Wanda whispered softly, her hands gently rubbing Rio’s upper arms to steady her, making sure her twitching limbs wouldn’t scrape or hurt her against the side of the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What’s happening?” Agatha choked, her voice trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s having a seizure,” Wanda explained calmly, eyes fixed on Rio’s trembling form. “How long has she been like this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The others looked around guiltily. Alice, Jen, and Billy, they hadn’t realised she was in distress until now. If Agatha hadn’t noticed, maybe no one would have.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not long,” Agatha said hurriedly, crouching beside Wanda and placing a reassuring hand on Rio’s knee. She squeezed gently, silently saying, ‘I’m here.’
    </p>
    <p>
     A few moments passed. The twitching ceased, and Rio’s vacant eyes fluttered rapidly as she slowly scanned the faces above her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Exhaustion was etched on her face as she gradually came to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her half-lidded eyes settled on Wanda, focusing slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How long?” Rio’s voice was faint, almost a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda inhaled sharply, then steadied her composure, pulling on her mask of reassurance.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Less than a minute. You’re okay,” she said softly, her voice soothing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed in relief, only faintly nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze locked onto Agatha’s shimmering blue eyes. A soft smile touched her lips, trying to reassure her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m good. Just tired,” Rio murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda stood then, motioning for Billy. "Help me take her up to her room."
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy moved gently, waiting for Rio’s permission.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hesitated, then nodded slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She felt a flush of shame, her once-toned physique had diminished somewhat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy easily lifted her now, cradling her comfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Watch her head,” Agatha called from behind as they ascended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Teen, if you drop her I will hurt you” Agatha started, her voice tense.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, take a breath,” Wanda interrupted calmly, turning fully to face her. A hand rested gently on her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s okay. This happens sometimes. Rio needs you to be strong now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated, her instincts to argue clashing with Wanda’s calm tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why don’t you go grab the gabapentin medication I showed you last night and take a moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Slowly, she nodded, took a deep breath, and headed to the kitchen for Rio’s medication.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands trembled as she fumbled with the child-proof bottle, her fingers clumsy with anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
     Leaning against the counter, she drew a breath, trying to regain control.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio needed calm. Reassurance. Strength. Not panic. Not fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Suddenly, Jen appeared silently behind her. She gently took the bottle from Agatha’s trembling hands, effortlessly opening it and sitting it aside. She then took Agatha’s hands in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their eyes met, Jen’s steady brown gaze radiated a warmth Agatha wasn’t used to, but one she desperately craved. It grounded her, offering unspoken comfort amid her vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tears spilled over before she could stop them. The tears she fought to contain released in a sudden, full wave of emotion, exposing her raw fear and helplessness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, it’s okay,” Jen whispered softly, pulling Agatha into a tight embrace. She held her tightly as Agatha’s sobs wracked her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen gently stroked her back, soothing her silent cries until her trembling eased.
    </p>
    <p>
     When they pulled apart, Agatha wiped her face furiously, her breathing slowing and evening out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen regarded her with calm, steady serenity, a quiet anchor she envied, longing to embody the same composure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t need a fragile, breaking Agatha. She needed her strength, her steadiness. Yet, beneath her veneer of control, the rising tide of fear threatened to undo her.

    <p>
     After composing herself and gathering Rio’s medication, Agatha ascended the stairs with a heavy heart, meeting Billy’s tight, sympathetic smile that conveyed understanding without words.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she gently pushed open the door, the room was filled with the soft cadence of Rio’s breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Beside her, Wanda hovered, nervously biting her thumbnail, a contrast to the warmth she offered Agatha with a gentle smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’ll be okay,” Wanda whispered reassuringly, her voice a gentle balm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She just needs to sleep it off. It usually takes a lot out of her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes drifted to Rio’s resting face, the exhaustion etched in her features causing Agatha’s heart to constrict painfully.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought of these frequent episodes over the recent months weighed heavily on her spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll stay with her, just to keep an eye on her, if that’s okay?” Her voice was barely a whisper, unfamiliar to her own ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s hand brushed softly against Agatha’s arm, a gesture filled with kindness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, that would be great, thanks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With quiet footsteps, Wanda exited the room, leaving Agatha to her vigil.
    </p>
    <p>
     She settled on the edge of the bed, her heart aching as she gently brushed stray hairs from Rio’s forehead, caressing her cheek delicately to avoid disturbing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her pulse quickened as she traced the outline of Rio’s jaw, overwhelmed by the fragility of the life resting beneath her touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     The depth of her love for Rio felt almost unbearably intense, consuming every part of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha…” Rio’s voice, barely a whisper, pierced the silence and struck Agatha’s heart like a delicate shard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s response was immediate, her voice tender, “I’m here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyelids fluttered open, a sleepy smile gracing her lips as she hovered between dreams and consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lie with me,” came the soft request.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s breath caught.
    </p>
    <p>
     Was Rio lucid enough to understand what she asked?
    </p>
    <p>
     But as Rio’s eyes opened more fully, the spark of awareness within them erased Agatha’s doubts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please,” Rio reiterated softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Without hesitation, Agatha nodded, compelled by a deep, unyielding desire to fufill any of Rio’s wishes. She lifted the covers and slipped beneath them, facing Rio with nurturing intent.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s arm curled instinctively around Agatha’s waist, drawing her close.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s fingers found their way to Rio’s silky hair, stroking gently just as Rio had always loved, a comforting ritual from their past.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio’s eyes drifted shut once more and her breathing settled, Agatha continued to run her fingers through Rio’s hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart and mind were alive with the profound happiness of their shared closeness, cherishing the warmth of Rio’s presence beside her, as they lay wrapped in the sanctuary of each other’s embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lay nestled in their shared sanctuary, every detail of Rio imprinted in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     The chatter from downstairs was a distant hum, a comforting reminder of life continuing on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet here, time held its breath, allowing her to savour this precious moment with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Earlier, Lilia had quietly entered, her presence a gentle reassurance.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had paused, smiling warmly at the sight of the two women entwined in quiet intimacy, before retreating with a knowing glance that spoke volumes.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a while, Rio began to stir.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyelashes fluttered like delicate wings, and when her gaze locked onto Agatha’s, an affectionate smile bloomed, radiating warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You stayed,” Rio whispered, her voice laced with relief and gratitude.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s heart danced at the sight of joy glimmering in Rio’s brown eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had been haunted by the fear that Rio might wake up and regret the closeness they’d shared.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not going anywhere,” Agatha declared, her tone firm and sincere.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shifted slightly, reaching for the medication she had brought earlier.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, sit up a little.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Skillfuly, she helped Rio adjust against the pillows.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio swallowed the medication, Agatha’s gaze flickered around the room, her nerves betraying her as they skimmed past those captivating brown eyes, their thighs a subtle connection beneath the covers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you feeling?” Agatha asked, her voice soft, tinged with cautious hope.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile was languid, content, as she settled further back into the comforting embrace of the pillows. “Better now, thanks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded, her gaze flitting around again, avoiding the intensity of Rio's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The noise from the other rooms seeped into their space, grounding them back into the bustling reality of life outside.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda, seriously, you look fine,” came Jens’ muffled assurance, echoing down the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued as she watched Rio, who was grinning with a gleam of mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, I know that look. What have you done, Vidal?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s grin widened, a picture of teasing innocence, as she casually tucked her hands behind her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I may have invited Nat to join us this weekend. Wanda found out this morning she’d be arriving… any minute now, actually,” Rio noted, checking the time on her Apple Watch with a playful glance.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes widened in amused disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my God. You're playing wingman for your wife?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s laughter filled the room, bubbling with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean, when you put it like that, it just sounds weird.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, that's exactly what it is, you idiot,” Agatha chuckled, her voice rippling with disbelief and affection.
    </p>
    <p>
     The laughter subsided as Rio let out a contented sigh, her hands settling on her lap. She ran her tongue along her cheek, an endearing, lifelong habit that betrayed her nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Sometimes, people just need a little push," Rio said softly, her eyes locking with Agatha’s, a truth simmering in their depths.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's breath caught, Rio’s words reverberating within her very soul.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her once-bright smile softened into contemplation, not from sorrow but from the overwhelming realisation and raw vulnerability that enveloped them both, binding them in an unspoken challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sometimes, people are scared to be happy,” Agatha replied, her voice barely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lowered her gaze to her hands, noticing the slight tremor as they rested on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile was gentle, understanding. She reached out, enveloping Agatha's trembling hand in hers with warmth and reassurance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "And sometimes, it’s okay to be scared. Being scared means you’re about to do something incredibly brave."
    </p>
    <p>
     The word 'brave' struck Agatha as though it were the first time she’d truly heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked up, meeting Rio’s softened expression with questioning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Brave.
    </p>
    <p>
     How foreign that word felt to Agatha, ever since that day five years past when her world crumbled, and she cast herself as a coward in her own narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet here was Rio, confronting challenges that loomed larger than life itself, her spirit undeterred and still wearing hope as a badge of honour.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's thoughts drifted back to that fateful conversation on the beach when Rio had gently confronted her with the truth of her fears. “You were scared. It was real, and you were scared to admit it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, she had run, driven by fear, the fear of owning her love for Rio, the possibility of happiness together, the vulnerability of it all.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, caught in this fleeting moment of clarity, Agatha faced the precipice of change, losing Rio forever or stepping into her fears.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart raced, her emotions surging with an intensity she hadn’t felt in years.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tears gathered in the corners of her eyes, shimmering with the weight of the unspoken longing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before fear could hold her back again, Agatha leaned forward, surrendering to her heart's resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers gently entwined in Rio’s hair, drawing her closer until their lips met.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a kiss tender yet resolute, a silent declaration of hope and renewal, shared in a moment where words no longer sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned into the kiss, the little gasp that had escaped her mouth swallowed by Agatha’s lips as she brought her hands to rest on her waist, her thumbs tracing the smooth expanse of skin underneath the white button up.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss deepened as Agatha opened her mouth, her lips tenderly and slowly parting to invite Rio further into the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio responded instinctively, tilting her head slightly to meld with Agatha’s movements, each gentle exploration met with equal curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers found their way to Agatha's hair, threading through the soft strands as if to anchor herself in the warmth they were creating together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hands moved with purpose, traveling from Rio’s waist up her back, each touch deliberate, creating a map of warmth and proximity.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their breaths intertwined, echoing the beating of their hearts that seemed to synchronise the closer they drew.
    </p>
    <p>
     The slow dance of lips revealed a language beyond words, a private exchange reflecting both newness and deep emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the serene space they occupied, time felt suspended, the world beyond fading as they lost themselves in the effortless connection of the kiss, savouring the shared harmony of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tears mixed with the kisses as both women pulled back, resting their foreheads together as their chests rose and fell a testament of how intense the kiss had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Im gonna need you to be that brave a lot more this weekend” Rio said breathlessly smiling as she tried to regain her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted a laugh, bringing her hand up to cover her face in embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio instantly pulled her hand away, looking directly into her eyes with a small smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ive missed that noise.” She said sincerely.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked down at their intertwined hands, squeezing softly as she took a steadying breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve missed us. I’ve missed how you used to make me laugh every day. I’ve missed you, so so much Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled widely, her gap tooth showing as she brought their intertwined hands up to her mouth, kissing Agatha’s fingers softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, let’s enjoy ourselves this weekend. Make up for lost time and laughs.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha knew Rio was referring to what time they had left, her eyes closing tightly at the hidden meaning behind her words as her heart clenched, shooting through her chest and making her stomach drop.
    </p>
    <p>
     Before she could dwell, the sounds of an approaching vehicle outside pulled her attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was already moving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Throwing the covers back as she bounced out the bed, her energy levels rejuvenated as she held her hand out to Agatha, helping her up from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s go watch Wanda spiral” she said with a wink pulling her onto her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Agatha slowly rose to her feet, she braced herself for Rio to step back, to create space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, Rio’s arms wrapped around her waist with a gentle but firm grip, pulling her in closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could feel the warmth of Rio’s body through the thin fabric of her shirt, the subtle scent of lavender and musk filling the air between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s fingers pressed softly into her skin, grounding her in the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then, with a tender motion, Rio leaned in and pressed her lips softly against Agatha’s, sending a delicate shiver down her spine and a flutter through her chest.

    <p>
     Rio waited patiently as Agatha changed, firmly insisting that her bikini wasn't suitable for a first impression. Although she'd protested passionately, Agatha finally reappeared, now wearing elegant white linen trousers and a lilac tank top.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they descended the stairs together, their hands occasionally brushed, sending a delightful shiver through Agatha, making every touch feel electric.
    </p>
    <p>
     A shift between them was undeniable; it was as if they had both stepped off a long-standing emotional cliff, embracing the exhilarating unknown, side by side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha felt a remarkable tranquility within, her usually restless mind finding calm, and her being felt lighter than ever. She was truly present, savouring the moment without worrying about what lay ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio seemed buoyant as well, her demeanour more vibrant than it had been all weekend, a sight that brought comfort to Agatha’s heart. In this moment, everything felt just right; Rio was beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
     As they reached the base of the stairs, laughter filled the air. Rio turned slightly, gently squeezing Agatha’s hand before releasing it to lead the way into the kitchen, where the laughter originated.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There she is! How are you feeling?” Wanda’s voice chimed as they entered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Joining Rio, Agatha walked into a lively group consisting of Wanda, Jen, Alice, and a striking redheaded woman she instinctively recognised as Nat. Her hair, cut elegantly to her shoulders, flattered her features, and her intense green eyes captured attention.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat exuded confidence as she reached out to Rio, her strong yet serene presence captivating the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda blushed subtly, exchanging a knowing glance with Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m glad you could make it, Nat. I apologise in advance for the chaos we're likely to create,” Rio said with a light-hearted laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Speak for yourself,” Jen retorted playfully, feigning offence.
    </p>
    <p>
     "I see you've met Alice and Jen already.Lilia and Billy are out on the beach, and this is Agatha," Rio announced warmly, gesturing with a proud smile for her to step forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a deep breath, straightening her shoulders as she approached Nat.
    </p>
    <p>
     The subtle rustle of her fabric with each step, the faint flicker of nervousness in her eyes, a mixture of anticipation and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
     She extended a hand, her smile slow and genuine, while her fingertips brushed her hair back, a small gesture of composure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve heard quite a bit about you,” Nat said softly, her voice like a gentle caress, a warm smile tugging at her lips that invited trust.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda nudged her lightly, an affectionate tease, prompting Agatha to raise a curious eyebrow, her expression a blend of intrigue and playful challenge.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, really? Wicked witch of the west, perhaps?” Agatha teased, arching an eyebrow as her eyes sparkled mischievously, casting a playful glance toward Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda rolled her eyes, her cheeks tinged with a faint blush of amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing of the sort,” she murmured, her tone soft, her smile lingering like a secret shared between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not exactly,” Nat interjected with a hint of humour.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I did hear you’re running low on the good stuff.” She reached into her messenger bag, her fingers brushing against the fabric, pulling out something wrapped in brown paper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s eyes widened with delight, a spark igniting within her as she eagerly took the package from Nat’s outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     The earthy scent of coffee wafted up as she unwrapped it, her fingers tingling at the anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Coffee! Okay, she can stay,” she exclaimed with unrestrained joy, her voice bright and lively, causing the group to laugh softly, the sound warm and genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
     As the laughter subsided, Agatha gently brewed herself a cup, the rich aroma curling around her senses, a warm cocoon amidst the cool air.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a slow sip, her shoulders relaxing, and let out a contented sigh that seemed to settle deep into her bones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Meanwhile, Nat was shown to her room by Wanda, whose cheeks were still faintly flushed, a mixture of flustered delight and something softer, more tender.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     “Something’s different,” Jen suddenly said, her voice cautious yet tinged with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her sharp gaze flicked between Agatha and Rio, narrowing in suspicion, as if trying to read a story hidden behind their expressions.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted her coffee mug, tasting the warm, bitter richness before letting her shoulders settle in a tranquil sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m caffeinated,” she said with a soft chuckle, a genuine smile blooming on her face. “All is right again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen continued to study them, her brow furrowed as her eyes danced with curiosity and something else, detection, perhaps.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” she pressed, voice more careful now. “Something else. Agatha… seems… happy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio fought the urge to smirk as her gaze dropped to the floor, aware of how quickly Agatha’s face was about to light up, or fall apart under scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jen, how about we go set up that volleyball net on the beach?” Alice suggested smoothly, her tone light and inviting, sensing the mounting tension.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no,” Agatha persisted, “Let’s hear it, Jen. Come on, what is in that tiny little mind of yours that’s got me so… happy, hmm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s smile turned saccharine, her tone sugary sweet but with a dangerous edge beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen crossed her arms, clearly unyielding.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think something happened upstairs,” Jen said cautiously, “with you and Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze flickered to Agatha, expectant, ready for her to brush it off, deny, steer away.
    </p>
    <p>
     But instead, her eyes softened just a little, a flicker of understanding passing between her and Rio, their silent connection thrumming between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you’d be correct,” Agatha admitted softly, her voice low and steady. “But since this is all very new, we kindly ask for discretion, Jennifer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She finished with a pointed stare that froze Jen in place, her jaw slack and eyes wide.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice stood nearby, her lips twitching into a barely contained grin, watching her wife’s stunned expression unravel.
    </p>
    <p>
     A half-gasp, half-laugh escaped Jen’s mouth as she looked back and forth between Agatha, Rio, and Alice, shaking her head in disbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fucking finally,” she whispered, her voice a mixture of relief and incredulity as she grabbed Alice by the arm steering her out of the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched in shock as Agatha sipped her coffee like nothing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, that was… not what I thought you were going to say.” Rio laughed as she leaned against the kitchen counter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugged, placing her now empty coffee mug in the kitchen sink and walking over to stand between Rio’s legs, wrapping her arms around Rio’s waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Im not running or hiding, but I dont want things to be awkward in front of Wanda. It wouldn’t feel right just yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed in agreement, her hands running up Agatha’s bare arms.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Kinda hoping Nat can keep her occupied enough this weekend.” She smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled back slightly, as her eyes widened.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio Vidal, did you invite Nat out here to seduce your wife so that you could sneak off with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus Agatha, why do you always have to make it weird?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because you are still married. I haven’t forgotten that part you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Only legally, we’ve been living apart for a year now. We just didn’t sign the papers because Wanda has really good health insurance and we both agreed to wait until… well until I didn’t need it anymore.” Rio said the last part in a smaller voice, not wanting to bring the mood down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha visibly flinched at the end of Rio’s words.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Dont"
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in slowly, her lips brushing softly against Rio’s in a tentative, delicate kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     The taste of coffee still lingered on her lips, warm and bittersweet, as she gently ran her hands up Rio’s back, fingers tracing the edges of her shoulder blades.
    </p>
    <p>
     With each touch, the kiss deepened naturally, a quiet, soulful exchange that spoke volumes beneath the surface of their words.
    </p>
    <p>
     But the moment was fleeting.
    </p>
    <p>
     The sharp sound of footsteps descending the stairs jerked Agatha back with a jolt, her eyes flickering with reluctance as she pulled away slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She quickly greeted Wanda and Nat as they entered, their faces unmistakably flushed, lips swollen that left little doubt about what they had been doing upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lower lip, suppressing a laugh that bubbled up, her eyes dancing with amusement as she watched the two redheads approach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s brow furrowed slightly, and her gaze fixed on Wanda and Nat with a mixture of surprise and quiet judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here she was, worried about making Wanda uncomfortable, only to realise the woman was currently eye-fucking Nat right in front of her, their shared shyness and residual blushes revealing just how intense their recent encounter had been.
    </p>
    <p>
     The two giggling redheads waved shyly, excitement and affection blending in their expressions, as they made their way past Rio and Agatha toward the patio doors.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked slowly, watching as the patio door slid shut behind them. The silence stretched between the remaining two, thick with unspoken tension.
    </p>
    <p>
     Turning to Rio, she saw that unmistakably smug smile creeping onto her face, a glint of mischief sparkling in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You were saying?” Rio drawled, her voice low and teasing.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     ...
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Screw it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha closed the small gap between them in one fluid motion, her decision made.
    </p>
    <p>
     Crashing her lips onto Rio’s in a fierce, hungry kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands, now trembling slightly, found their way into Rio’s hair as she devoured the taste of her, the warmth of her mouth electrifying with anticipation and longing.
    </p>
    <p>
     The connection was raw and urgent, a collision of desire that momentarily erased everything else.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands made contact with the soft skin underneath Rio’s t-shirt, tracing the expanse of her lower back, nails scratching lightly making the other woman shudder and moan slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s hands gripped the back of Agatha’s neck, her hands winding through the brown hair working their way into her scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well its about damn time” Came a voice behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Both women pulled apart from one another to look at the figure standing in the living room eyeing them with a smug smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously Lilia, I’m getting you a fucking bell.” Agatha scoffed, running her hand through her hair in an attempt to compose herself, while Rio stifled a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Im just glad to see that you two finally… getting along.” Lilia said as she ambled around the kitchen for nothing in particular.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt her face flush as she looked at her feet, Agatha glared daggers at the older woman but failed to hide the smile creeping up her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anyway Rio, I brought my tarot cards with me if you would like a reading? I can tell some guidance is required.” Lilia suddenly said her eyes boring into the younger woman.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyebrows shot up in surprise, “Oh, I suppose I could use some Devine intervention and what not” she chuckled, her hand rubbing the back of her neck awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed louder this time, “Absolutely not, your not putting your decisions in the hands of fucking Lilia and her parlour tricks”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Honey those parlour tricks told me a long long time ago that you two would end up together, don’t write them off just yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia's revelation left Rio and Agatha momentarily stunned, their skepticism giving way to a curious intrigue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia smoothly retrieved her deck of tarot cards, spreading them across the table with the well-practiced shuffle of a seasoned reader.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Alright, let's hear what the universe has to say," Rio said, a playful challenge in her tone as she took a seat across from Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hovered nearby, still skeptical but lured by the mystique in Lilia's eyes and the quiet confidence with which she handled the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia’s fingers danced over the array of cards before selecting a few.
    </p>
    <p>
     As she began to turn them over, her usually light demeanour shifted, becoming more serious.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let’s see here,” she murmured, studying the spread with a focused gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she flipped the final card, Lilia's face softened into an expression of calm resolve.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio, the cards advise caution," she said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     "The path of intervention carries great risk, the kind that asks you to weigh everything on scales of uncertainty."
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's smile faltered slightly as her expression turned thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, sensing the shift, stepped closer.
    </p>
    <p>
     "What exactly does that mean, Lilia?" she asked, her voice low and edged with concern.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia met Rio’s eyes with sincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It hints at avoiding a dangerous decision. It’s like a warning, perhaps not to proceed with something. Sometimes, the best action is none at all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked down, her fingers tracing the edges of the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
     The room seemed to shrink around them as the unspoken words hung heavily between the three women.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's patience snapped as realisation dawned.
    </p>
    <p>
     "Rio,” she said, her voice sharp and filled with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are not seriously reconsidering the surgery because of this, are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced up, her eyes meeting Agatha’s with a mixture of frustration and vulnerability.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t know, Agatha. What if it’s a sign ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s expression changed from disbelief to anger, as her fear for Rio's health boiled to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can’t base a decision this critical on a tarot reading!” she nearly shouted, her voice quivering with emotion. “This isn’t just any choice, it’s your fucking life!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her mouth to speak, but Agatha cut her off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t believe you’d let a few cards sway you one way or another. You need to listen to your doctors, the experts, not fortune-telling, for god's sake!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia rose quietly, recognising the tension she’d unintentionally intensified.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, the cards are just a tool for reflection. Rio, they might show possibilities, but they’re not absolutes. The decision is ultimately yours, and yours alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence settled over them again, heavy and charged with emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I cant believe this.” Agatha stormed out of the kitchen, the anger radiating from her in waves as she slammed the patio screen door wide opened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked over to Lilia who was looking at her with a thoughtful look, her eyes shimmering with unshed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s scared.” Lilia said softly. “We all are.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded solemnly, running her fingers nervously along the cracks in the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don’t want to hurt her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia reached over, taking Rio’s hand in her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Talk to her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence was thick and reverberating in Rio’s ears as she sat quietly with Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     The burden of the decision weighed heavily on her, but Lilia’s gentle squeeze brought a small semblance of comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
     After a moment, Rio took a deep breath and slowly stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her heart pounded with a turbulent mix of emotions, love, fear, confusion but beneath it all, there was a surge of determination.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll talk to her,” she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia nodded encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just be honest. She needs to understand what you’re going through.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio left the table and made her way to the patio where Agatha stood, looking out at the waves crashing against the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Further down on the beach, the rest of the group had begun messing around with the volleyball net, their laughter echoing on the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s posture was stiff; her back turned to Rio as if trying to shield herself from hurtful words and the weight of impending loss.
    </p>
    <p>
     As Rio approached, she called out gently, “Agatha…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t turn immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her shoulders rose and fell with a shaky breath, and when she finally glanced over her shoulder, her eyes were bright with unshed tears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, I,” she started, but Rio shook her head, closing the space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, let me say this first,” Rio interrupted, reaching out to rest a hand on Agatha’s arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m terrified, Agatha. I’ve never been more scared of anything in my life, and it’s because I don’t want to lose you or leave you behind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked, biting her lip as she tried to maintain her composure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio continued, her words steady but full of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know this reading isn’t something we should base my health decisions on, but it brought to light all my fears. I need to make a decision with a clear head, not just react to every emotion.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded slowly, understanding creeping into her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I understand you're scared Rio, I’m scared too. But I need you to fight, to trust in the possibilities that modern medicine offers us. I don’t want to lose you because you didn’t fight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Tears gathered in Rio’s eyes, spilling over as she embraced Agatha tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I promise I’ll really think this through, talk to the doctors again. I think it would be good if you were to come talk to them too?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hugged her back fiercely, relief flooding through her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We’ll face this together, whatever comes.”

    <p>
     The night had stretched long and sweet around the crackling fire.
    </p>
    <p>
     The beach house, silhouetted behind them, pulsed with soft music from inside, someone had queued up the old summer playlist on an ancient Bluetooth speaker that had somehow survived the years.
    </p>
    <p>
     Prince bled into Stevie Nicks. Someone was humming along. Probably Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia was settled deep into one of the faded lounge chairs, swirling wine and telling stories in her perfectly dry tone, tonight’s tale involved a suspiciously dramatic goat rescue and a very angry vineyard owner. Jen and Alice were across from her on a blanket, tangled together like ivy, each holding half of a shared beer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat in the chair nearest the fire, hoodie pulled up over her head, her eyes bright even in the firelight. She wasn’t talking much, but her quiet smile stayed in place.
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha, seated on the same bench, a foot apart but clearly tuned into her like a second heartbeat, was the only one still drinking coffee instead of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, real talk,” Billy said, sitting cross-legged beside the cooler, cheeks pink from both booze and the marshmallow he’d just tried (and failed) to toast.
     <br/>
     “We’ve all aged like fine wine except Lilia, who’s aged like an angry whiskey.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll take it,” Lilia said without missing a beat. “Better than your gin-and-sprite energy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Billy raised his bottle in a solemn toast.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I missed this,” Jen said, glancing around. “Us. This stupid fire. These stories. The total lack of cell service.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Speak for yourself,” Alice said, glancing down at her phone, which showed a full red X for signal. “I’m sending an email by pigeon tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat chuckled from her spot near the edge of the fire circle, half-shadowed, quietly nursing a drink. She hadn’t said much, but she was listening, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
     Comfortable in the rhythm, if not quite inside the old circle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda was seated beside her. Not quite touching. Not obviously anything. But every now and then their eyes would meet, and something flickered. Something shared. Quietly unfolding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned toward Rio slightly, keeping her voice low. “They’re cute.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked. “They think they’re being subtle.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They are not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They’re really not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s gaze lingered on Wanda for a moment longer. There was no bitterness there, just a strange kind of warmth. Pride.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then she looked back at Agatha. Her voice dipped.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you for coming back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced over, surprised at the vulnerability in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wasn’t sure I should.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m really glad you did.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The fire popped, sending a shower of sparks into the night.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright,” Billy said, clapping his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “New rule. Everyone has to say something they regret not doing. This is about missed chances. Ghosts. Spice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate ghosts,” Rio groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Regret?” Wanda asked, raising an eyebrow. “You sure we want to go there?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do,” Rio said, her voice soft but steady. “I think it’s kind of… necessary.”
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, the group fell quiet. The fire crackled. Someone shifted. Lilia took a long sip of wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then Agatha said, “I regret leaving.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t say when. She didn’t have to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn’t look away. “I regret not making you stay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That silence had a different texture now, heavier, but honest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen cleared her throat. “Okay, well, I regret not learning how to drive stick.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You still can’t drive stick?” Billy gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m gay, Billy. I have soft hands and strong opinions. Leave me alone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Laughter broke the moment apart gently. A release.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda stood slowly, brushing the sand from her jeans. “I’m going to get some air. Nat, wanna come with?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat glanced around, then nodded, casual. “Sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither made a show of it. But as they disappeared around the side of the house, Agatha’s eyes followed them briefly, then returned to Rio with a faint smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They’ll be okay,” she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio watched the fire, her voice barely audible.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So will we.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The moon was bright enough to see without a flashlight, casting everything in a pale glow. Nat had brought two beers from the cooler, cold and wet against their palms.
    </p>
    <p>
     They walked side by side, close but not touching. Not here. Not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda sat down on a driftwood log half-buried in sand, letting out a long breath as she opened her beer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn’t think I’d come this weekend,” she said after a moment. “Didn’t think I should.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat sat beside her. “I’m glad you did.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda offered a faint, crooked smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. So am I. Now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a long pause as the waves rolled in, steadier than hearts, less complicated than people.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wasn’t sure what it would feel like,” Wanda said finally. “Being here. Seeing her like this. Knowing what’s ahead.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat’s voice was gentle. “She looks good. Tired, but… solid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda nodded. “She feels different. Lighter. In a weird way. And not just because of the tumour crap.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She laughed softly at her own phrasing. It came out brittle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat waited.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda looked up at the stars, squinting like they might hold answers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think I’ve known about her and Agatha since before she did. Something about the way she says her name. Like it’s a question and a prayer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re okay with that?” Nat asked, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda nodded. “I think I was always meant to be a chapter, not the whole story.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat turned to her, brow furrowing with sympathy. “That must be hard.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” Wanda admitted. “But… it’s also kind of a relief. She finally told Agatha how she feels. I’ve been waiting for her to do that for years. Watching her carry that love like a wound. It was exhausting just being near it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat stayed quiet, letting the ocean fill the space between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda took a swig from her bottle, then added, more quietly, “And I think she’s scared, sure. But she’s also… happier now. I can see it in her face. That edge she’s had for the last couple years… it’s dulled. Like she’s not fighting herself anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat looked at her carefully. “And you? How are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda smirked at her beer. “Other than being technically still married to the woman I’m maybe a little bit in love with still,but also proud of, and worried for, and completely wrong for?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That sounds… deeply normal,” Nat teased.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda laughed, head tipping back. “God, you’re a terrible therapist.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not your therapist,” Nat said, a little too softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda turned to her. The air shifted, just slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     For a moment, they just looked at each other. The kind of look that says we’re both trying to be careful, and maybe we’re not ready, and maybe we are.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda gently bumped her shoulder. “I like being around you. I’m sorry it’s complicated.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat smiled. “I don’t mind complicated. As long as it’s honest.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It is,” Wanda said. “It really is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda looked at Nat again, eyes softer now, less guarded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like being around you,” she said, voice low. “You make me feel… like I’m allowed to let go of the guilt. For how things ended. For not being able to fix it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat’s voice was warm, steady. “You don’t have to fix anything. Sometimes things just… end. And that’s not failure. That’s life.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda let the words settle in her chest. She blinked once. Twice. Then nodded, almost to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     The waves rolled in quietly. The sand cooled beneath them. There was no one watching, no audience…just two women trying to meet in the middle of something raw and fragile.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat brushed a loose strand of hair behind Wanda’s ear. “You’re allowed to want something good. Even now. Even when it’s messy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s throat tightened. “You sure?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat smiled. “Yeah. I’m sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Wanda leaned in, slowly, carefully, like she was checking if the door was really open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat met her halfway.
    </p>
    <p>
     The kiss was barely there at first, just a soft meeting of mouths. No hunger. No heat. Just breath and salt and the question of what if?
    </p>
    <p>
     When Wanda pulled back, her forehead rested lightly against Nat’s.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you,” she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For what?” Nat asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For not needing me to be someone else first.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat smiled, her voice nearly a whisper. “I like you as you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They sat like that a moment longer, quiet, close, not needing to rush.
     <br/>
     Whatever this was, it didn’t need to be more than what it was tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just something real.
     <br/>
     And soft.
     <br/>
     And finally, allowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     ———————
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The laughter had faded. One by one, doors creaked shut. Billy had passed out on the couch with a snack bag tucked under his arm; Lilia had stolen a throw blanket from the back of a chair and disappeared with a whispered “goodnight.” Alice and Jen had gone upstairs arm in arm, leaving the fire dying low and the house settling into stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stood in the small kitchen, barefoot, the soft yellow glow of the under-cabinet lights brushing over her features.
    </p>
    <p>
     She poured a glass of water and opened the medication bottle Wanda had left on the counter, counting out the small pills with careful fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio came in just as Agatha set the glass down. Her hair was loose now, hoodie abandoned, shoulders tired in a way that was too deep to be from just the day.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held out the water and pills without speaking. Just met her eyes and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took them wordlessly, their fingers brushing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you,” Rio murmured, after she swallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hesitated, then added gently, “Wanda reminded me you might forget. She said it’s always worse if you take it late.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled, small and bittersweet. “She’s still taking care of me. Even when she shouldn’t have to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head. “Love doesn’t really follow those rules, does it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her then, really looked. Her voice came quiet, uncertain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will you stay? Tonight. Just… stay with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s answer came without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     ———————
    </p>
    <p>
     The door closed softly behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t a rush.
     <br/>
     It wasn’t a frenzy.
     <br/>
     It was slow.
     <br/>
     Like exhaling after five years of holding your breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat on the edge of the bed and watched Agatha cross the room to turn off the lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
     Moonlight spilled across the sheets. Her silhouette was all soft lines and remembered curves, familiar in a way that made Rio ache.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha turned back, Rio was already waiting, hands folded in her lap, heart in her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m scared,” she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat beside her, threading their fingers together.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes shimmered, unshed tears catching in the dim light.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I don’t want to feel afraid tonight. Not if I get to have this. You.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in, brushing her lips over Rio’s in a kiss so gentle it felt like a question. And Rio answered it with a breath, with the way her hand slid to Agatha’s jaw, holding her there, deepening the kiss with aching softness.
    </p>
    <p>
     They undressed each other in reverent silence, no rush, no performance. Just the slow unfolding of skin and trust. Clothes pooled on the floor like petals.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha’s hands were everywhere, careful and familiar, rediscovering. She kissed the scar on Rio’s ribs, the hollow beneath her collarbone, the space behind her ear where Rio shivered just like she used to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio touched Agatha like she was learning her all over again, but never really forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers traced every line, every dip and curve, like trying to memorise her in case this night was all they had.
    </p>
    <p>
     Their bodies met with tenderness first, cheeks brushing, hands clasped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then with heat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Then with the kind of breathless, desperate closeness that came only from time lost and finally found.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t about release.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t about proving anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was about belonging.
    </p>
    <p>
     About the way Rio whispered Agatha’s name like a prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
     About the way Agatha held her afterward, forehead pressed to hers, and said, “I love you. I’ve always loved you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Rio, quiet and teary, said, “Then don’t let me go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I won’t,” Agatha promised. “Not tonight. Not ever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They drifted to sleep tangled in each other, warm and safe and finally whole.
    </p>
    <p>
     Outside, the ocean kept its rhythm.
     <br/>
     Inside, so did they.

     The light was soft.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pale gold filtered in through gauzy curtains, washing over the tangled bedding, the dust motes drifting slowly in the hush of morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio woke slowly at first. The warmth of the sheets. The faint, rhythmic sound of waves outside. Her cheek pressed to the pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then, all at once, her eyes snapped open.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat up too fast, heart leaping into her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Breath caught.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hands gripping the edge of the mattress, panic blooming behind her ribs like a bruise.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bed beside her was,
    </p>
    <p>
     Occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lay still, her back to Rio, one hand curled gently against the pillow, her breathing deep and steady in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared for a long time, not moving, barely breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was still here.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hadn’t left.
    </p>
    <p>
     The flood of relief came so fast it made her dizzy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her muscles sagged under the weight of it. She slowly eased back down onto her side, facing her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Five years ago, it had been different.
    </p>
    <p>
     That morning had been cold and quiet and empty.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’d reached for Agatha and found only cold sheets.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her clothes folded neatly on the chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     No note.
     <br/>
     No explanation.
     <br/>
     Just the hollow echo of something that had felt too real to vanish like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     She remembered sitting at the foot of the bed, still in shock, for what felt like hours.
     <br/>
     Replaying every second.
     <br/>
     Trying to figure out what she’d done wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
     But this morning… this morning was full.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of air.
     <br/>
     Of warmth.
     <br/>
     Of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t know what had changed in the universe to let her have this moment again.
     <br/>
     But it felt like grace.
     <br/>
     Like a second chance she hadn’t dared to hope for.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hand moved without thinking, brushing softly against the blanket covering Agatha’s shoulder,  just enough to feel the weight of her presence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still here.
    </p>
    <p>
     And yet… even as the relief settled in, something else began to curl its fingers around her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     What if this didn’t last?
    </p>
    <p>
     What if this, this warmth, this quiet, this fleeting peace, was all she got?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard, her gaze fixed on Agatha’s sleeping form.
    </p>
    <p>
     If I die… what happens to her?
    </p>
    <p>
     The thought came like a crack in glass. Shards of guilt. Fear.
    </p>
    <p>
     Getting close again meant hurting her again.
     <br/>
     Maybe worse this time.
     <br/>
     A permanent kind of hurt.
     <br/>
     A grief she couldn’t pull her back from.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it would’ve been kinder not to say anything.
     <br/>
     To keep their love folded away like a letter she never sent.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then…
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s eyes fluttered shut.
    </p>
    <p>
     Another thought. Softer. Braver.
    </p>
    <p>
     What if I survive?
    </p>
    <p>
     She exhaled slowly, almost afraid of the shape that idea took in her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     What if the surgery worked?
     <br/>
     What if the tumour was gone, or at least beaten back far enough that she got to live?
    </p>
    <p>
     What would it feel like to wake up to mornings like this, not just once, but again and again?
    </p>
    <p>
     To have Agatha there, tucked into her side, grumbling about sunlight and stealing the covers.
    </p>
    <p>
     To make breakfast together, argue about whose turn it was to do dishes, kiss her sleepy smile just to hear her laugh?
    </p>
    <p>
     What would it mean to stay?
    </p>
    <p>
     To build something, slowly, imperfectly, but real, with the woman she’d loved for years?
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened her eyes and looked at Agatha again.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was a faint crease in her brow, even in sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     A seriousness she wore even when the world wasn’t asking anything of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to smooth it away with her thumb. To tell her it would all be okay.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if she couldn’t promise it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if she was scared.
    </p>
    <p>
     Especially because she was scared.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio inched a little closer, careful not to wake her, and let herself lie there,  close enough to hear her breath. To feel her warmth.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn’t alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     And maybe, just maybe, not for many mornings to come.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The light in the kitchen was pale and soft, the ocean fog still clinging to the windows. The kettle hadn’t finished boiling yet. The house was mostly asleep, floors creaking under old bones, someone snoring faintly in the loft.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio padded in barefoot, hoodie sleeves long over her hands, her hair tangled from sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was surprised to find the light already on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda stood at the stove, back turned, stirring something in a small pan. She wore one of Nat’s flannel shirts over her tank top, the sleeves rolled up, her hair knotted high on her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re up,” Rio said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda turned, smiled a little. “So are you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged, rubbing a hand over the back of her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Didn’t sleep long.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda studied her for a moment. “You never do when you think too much.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio offered a crooked smile. “That obvious?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda raised a brow, then turned back to the pan, eggs, by the smell. “You slept with Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her mouth to deny it out of reflex, and then stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda said nothing for a beat, just stirred slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m happy for you,” she said, eventually.
    </p>
    <p>
     Soft. Real.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked, caught off guard. “You are?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda turned to face her fully this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t want to know what happened, how it happened, or whether she still hums in her sleep—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She does,” Rio muttered, then winced.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda groaned. “Boundaries, Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, relieved. “Right, sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda leaned back against the counter, arms folded loosely across her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look better,” she said, eyes scanning Rio’s face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Softer. Not like you’ve figured everything out, but like… you’re not holding your breath anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think I’m scared it’s going to disappear,” Rio admitted. “Like I’ll blink and she’ll be gone again. Or I’ll be gone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda nodded slowly, then reached over and flicked the kettle off before it could whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I get it. You don’t trust the good things to stay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked down, fingers curled tight around the edge of the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But they can,” Wanda added, gentler now. “Sometimes they do. And I think… Agatha’s one of those things. She always was. You just never believed it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her, eyes glassy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You really don’t hate me for this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hate you?” Wanda repeated, eyebrows lifting.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, I loved you. I probably always will, in a very complicated, exhausted kind of way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She stepped closer, voice dropping.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I love you enough to want you to be happy, even if I’m not the one giving it to you anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard. “Wanda…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda reached out and gently tucked a piece of hair behind her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not saying it doesn’t ache a little,” she said. “But that’s not your fault. It’s just grief. Old love turning into something else.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s throat tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re still the person I trust most,” she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don’t have to stop trusting me,” Wanda said. “I’m not going anywhere. You’re stuck with me, remember? Vows or not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both smiled, a little sad, a little full.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda pulled her into a hug.
     <br/>
     Not romantic.
     <br/>
     Not longing.
     <br/>
     Just tight and steady and real.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re my best friend,” she murmured into Rio’s hair. “You always will be.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio squeezed her eyes shut.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you. For being here. For taking care of me when I couldn’t. For pushing me toward her when I was too scared.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda pulled back just enough to meet her eyes. “Just don’t make me hear the details, alright? I can root for you two without a full soundtrack.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed wetly. “Deal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda gave her one last squeeze, then turned back to the stove. “Now sit your ass down. I’m making eggs. Then you can have your smoothie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sank into a chair, pretending to gag but smiling softly.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda plated the eggs with more force than necessary, setting one in front of Rio before sliding into the chair across from her. Her tea steamed between them, untouched now.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t speak right away, just watched Rio tuck her hoodie sleeves back and start picking at breakfast. The quiet stretched. The air was heavy with things neither had quite said.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Wanda exhaled hard, setting her mug down with a soft clink.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I keep trying to tell myself it’s not my business,” she said. “That you have Agatha now, and I’m just supposed to, what? Be supportive. Smile. Stay in my lane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up, startled by the shift in her tone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But the truth is, I’m terrified, Rio,” Wanda said, her voice catching. “Not because of Agatha. Or us. But because you’re walking around like maybe this is all the time you get. Like maybe the end is already written.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s shoulders dropped. “It might be.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It might not,” Wanda snapped, not unkind, just scared. “And I hate that you’ve made peace with dying before even trying to live.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “I’m not—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You are,” Wanda said. “You’re acting like you only get one more chapter, and you’re trying to cram all the good stuff in before the lights go out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She scrubbed a hand over her face, frustrated tears welling now.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can’t… I can’t do it, Rio. I can’t sit here and watch you give up because it’s easier to say goodbye on your own terms than risk staying.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at her, throat closing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know it’s not fair for me to say this,” Wanda continued, her voice softer but trembling, “but I love you so much, and the thought of you being gone, really gone, makes me feel like the floor’s going to fall out from under me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m sorry,” Rio said quietly. “I’m scared of surviving and not being the same. Of losing pieces of myself. Of being too broken to come back to her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda reached across the table, grabbing her hand, not gently, not delicately. Just firm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then let us help put you back together. Me. Her. Everyone. You don’t have to come back the same, you just have to come back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard. “You really want me to do it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want you to try,” Wanda whispered. “I want you to want to be here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence between them went still. Heavy. Raw.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Rio nodded. Just once.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told Agatha I’d talk to the surgeon again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s shoulders slumped in quiet relief. She stood and rounded the table, pulling Rio into a hug so tight it hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’d better,” she murmured into her hair. “Because I’m not ready for a world that doesn’t have you in it. And I don’t think she is either.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clung to her, heart pounding. “I don’t think I am either.”
    </p>
    <p>
     And for a few minutes, there was no pain, no past, no fear. Just two people who had once built a life together holding tight to the one thing they’d never stop being to each other:
    </p>
    <p>
     Home.
    </p>
    <p>
     ---------
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha woke slowly, the kind of sleep-drunk haze that made time feel untrustworthy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her body was warm, her limbs tangled in the covers, and the pillow beside her was indented, still holding the shape of another head.
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached instinctively toward it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Empty.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes snapped open. The other half of the bed was vacant, the sheets cool.
    </p>
    <p>
     Panic bloomed instantly, low in her stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     No.No no no no
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat up sharply, hair falling around her face, heart pounding too fast.
     <br/>
     The last time she’d woken like this was five years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Only then, she was the one who’d slipped out of bed in the early light.
    </p>
    <p>
     Who’d grabbed her shoes with trembling hands and run before Rio could wake up.
     <br/>
     Before she could say anything real. Before she could ruin the fragile joy they’d touched the night before.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now… for one jagged second, Agatha thought maybe she’d ruined it again, even if she hadn’t moved this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe Rio had woken before her and remembered the ache. The hurt. The hollow she left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     God, what if she left? What if I did it again just by being me?
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, from somewhere downstairs, the faint sound of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Muted. Familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze, listening. The voice wasn’t sharp or angry. It was tired, amused. Still there.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still here.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let out a breath she didn’t know she was holding, her shoulders sagging.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn’t left.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hadn’t either.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned back against the pillows, hand still pressed against her chest like she was holding her own ribs together.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her mind was already racing, thinking about coffee, the smell of eggs, the possibility of a kiss in the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
     Of how she might reach for Rio and not be pushed away. Of mornings… plural. Not just this one.
    </p>
    <p>
     She blinked up at the ceiling, watery-eyed.
    </p>
    <p>
     You stayed. And so did she.
    </p>
    <p>
     A different kind of panic rose now, gentler, but no less sharp- what if I get used to this? What if I let myself want it, and then I lose her for real?
    </p>
    <p>
     Because loving Rio wasn’t a crush anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn’t a moment. It was a future she was starting to picture in terrifying detail.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     And now that she’d finally held it again, skin, breath, laughter, safety, Agatha didn’t know if she could survive losing it all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     But maybe, she thought, clutching the edge of the blanket, this time I stay. And maybe she does too. And maybe we get more than just one morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn’t move from the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not yet.
    </p>
    <p>
     She just let the light wash over her, hand on the empty pillow beside her, a pillow that wasn’t cold anymore, just lived-in.
    </p>
    <p>
     And for once, she didn’t run.
    </p>
    <p>
     She waited.
    </p>
    <p>
     Because she wanted Rio to come back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     And she had a feeling she would.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     In the kitchen, a pan sizzled gently on the stove, Wanda at the helm, focused and precise in her movements.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia hummed under her breath from the floor, still braiding tiny wildflowers into a chain. Jen had taken up her usual perch by the window, one long leg crossed over the other, her matcha clutched like a shield against anything earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat curled on a stool, bare feet hooked on the rungs, hoodie sleeves swallowed around her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hair was still damp from the shower, her cheeks slightly flushed, from the heat or something else, no one asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     The bottom step creaked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stepped in without fanfare, dressed in one of Rio’s sweatshirts, sleeves pushed up, the collar lopsided in a way that felt intimate even without context.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her eyes moved straight to Rio like they always did now, quietly, instinctively and she smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Small. Real.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio’s smile bloomed instantly in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     Neither of them said anything. They didn’t need to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved toward the counter, brushing gently past Rio’s back, the kind of touch that could’ve been an accident but wasn’t. Rio leaned ever so slightly into it, just enough for Agatha to feel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda saw the whole thing, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t react.
     <br/>
     Didn’t let her hands falter. She flipped the eggs with practiced calm, the sizzle giving her something to anchor to.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was happy for them. She was.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’d meant every word she said the night before. But watching it, this,  was harder than she expected.
    </p>
    <p>
     There was something too familiar in the way Rio tilted her head when Agatha murmured something low. Something that pulled at old muscle memory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda exhaled softly through her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     Kept her eyes on the pan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took the mug Rio handed her without looking, their fingers brushing. Her hand lingered a second longer than necessary, thumb grazing across Rio’s palm like punctuation.
    </p>
    <p>
     No one said anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen turned a page in her book.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia kept humming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda plated the eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
     The silence felt… fine. Not tense. Not heavy. Just thick with things unspoken, as all quiet love is.
    </p>
    <p>
     She brought the plate over, setting tit down in front of Agatha with a simple, “Eat while it’s hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks,” Agatha said gently but didn’t quite meet Wanda’s gaze. She didn’t need to. The gesture had already said enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda sat across from them, folding her hands around her mug. She didn’t look at their joined knees under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn’t glance at the way Agatha’s pinky hooked softly around Rio’s. She just drank slowly and let the warmth of the mug fill the space the silence left behind.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then-
    </p>
    <p>
     The screen door creaked again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hope I didn’t miss all the eggs,” came a familiar voice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s head jerked up a little too fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat stood in the garden doorway, sunglasses perched on her head, hair windswept and sleep-rumpled. She was wearing one of Wanda’s flannels unbuttoned over a tank top, and grinning like she belonged exactly where she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re late,” Wanda said, aiming for neutral but landing somewhere between fond and flustered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat stepped inside with the kind of ease that meant she’d done this before. Many times.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I made peace with my sins. Thought I’d repent with breakfast.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled into her tea.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lowered her gaze, biting back a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda didn’t say anything at first, just stood, suddenly restless, and grabbed a plate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I saved you some,” she said without turning around.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat came up behind her and touched the small of her back, nothing dramatic, nothing for anyone else. Just enough to say: I see you.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda’s shoulders loosened.
    </p>
    <p>
     She handed Nat the plate, their hands brushing. A faint blush rose up the side of her neck, betraying her composure more than she liked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat pretended not to notice. Or maybe she did, and just didn’t mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda sat back down at the table, this time angled ever so slightly toward Nat as she joined them. Not a shift away from Rio and Agatha, just a shift toward something new.
    </p>
    <p>
     No one mentioned the warmth blooming in the room now, different kinds, different roots. But all of it quietly, deeply real.
    </p>
    <p>
     And for a while, no one needed to talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     They just ate.
    </p>
    <p>
     Together.
    </p>
    <p>
     -------
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The sun had burned off the last of the fog, and the beach behind the house shimmered like something half-remembered from a dream.
    </p>
    <p>
     The tide was low, the sand warm underfoot, and the sound of crashing waves stitched its way between easy laughter and the rustle of towels being shaken out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Billy had arrived midmorning in a flurry of sand and enthusiasm, Billy carrying two surfboards under one arm like it was nothing and Alice already peeling off her shirt with a whoop.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Waves are good today,” Billy called over his shoulder, already jogging toward the surf.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Better be,” Alice said, kicking off her shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need to erase every dumb thought I’ve had this week via saltwater.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That’s what therapy’s for,” Jen muttered, reclining deeper into her beach chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Saltwater is cheaper,” Alice shot back, grinning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was still fussing with the blanket she and Rio had set down closer to the dunes, far enough from the tide to stay dry, close enough for Rio to hear the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept adjusting the umbrella, nudging it this way and that like it might shield Rio from the sun and the sky and the fragility of the world itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat cross-legged on the blanket, sunglasses perched on her nose, a soft smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. She was letting her head rest back, the breeze tugging gently at the ends of her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m fine, you know,” she said, as Agatha tucked a water bottle beside her and refolded the spare towel for the third time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You say that like I haven’t seen you unconscious twice this weekend.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed, quiet and warm. “You gonna hover the whole time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Agatha said simply, kneeling beside her now. “I am. You’re not allowed to complain about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m not complaining.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced over, her gaze lingering, lips soft, eyes scanning her face like she was memorising it for the hundredth time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good,” she said.
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached out, not quite thinking, and brushed a loose strand of hair from Rio’s cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her fingers lingered just a second too long. Rio caught her hand and held it there, resting it lightly against her jaw, then turned and kissed her palm.
    </p>
    <p>
     They both froze for a heartbeat, not out of uncertainty, but reverence. Like the moment was holy.
    </p>
    <p>
     Across the beach, Lilia lay stretched out on a striped towel beside Wanda and Jen, a wide straw hat covering her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen was flipping lazily through a magazine, sunglasses hiding the fact that she was mostly watching the others.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda had her eyes closed, arms behind her head, trying to soak in the sun without letting her thoughts wander too far toward the blanket near the dunes.
    </p>
    <p>
     She heard the laugh before she opened her eyes. Rio again.
    </p>
    <p>
     And then Agatha’s voice, low and fond and sharp at the edges.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda smiled to herself, small, tired, true.
    </p>
    <p>
     She could feel Nat nearby without looking.
    </p>
    <p>
     The occasional glint of sun off wet shoulders. The sound of her board skimming across the surf. Wanda didn’t have to watch her to feel anchored.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, when she did turn her head and saw Nat paddling back toward the shore, hair slicked back and mouth curled in a satisfied grin, Wanda sat up straighter.
    </p>
    <p>
     Just a little.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hoped no one noticed. Especially not Jen, who definitely noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice was shouting something to Billy from out in the waves, something competitive and deeply unserious.
    </p>
    <p>
     He responded with a whoop and a splash that drenched them both. Lilia lifted the brim of her hat briefly and called out a warning about riptides. Neither of them listened.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, they’re like puppies,” Jen muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They’re happy,” Wanda said, without thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen tilted her head, eyes on her. “You okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda nodded once. “I’m getting there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A few yards away, Agatha leaned back on one elbow beside Rio, still watching her like she was the sun and the sky and maybe also the reason the ocean stayed where it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You warm enough?” she asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio arched an eyebrow behind her sunglasses. “You’ve asked me that four times.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fifth’s the charm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’m fine, Aggie, today is a good day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swallowed. “Tell me if that changes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I will,” Rio said. Then reached out and took her hand. “Promise.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They lay there in silence for a while after that. Just holding hands, side by side on the blanket. Letting the waves talk for them. Letting the salt settle on their skin. Letting themselves believe this might be one of many days like this.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it could be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe.
    </p>
    <p>
     If they let it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Farther down the beach, Nat dropped her board and walked up the sand, water streaming down her legs. She passed Wanda, still reclining, and gave her a slight nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You gonna join us?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda opened one eye. “And risk you all seeing me fall off the board like an uncoordinated giraffe? No thanks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat grinned. “You say that like it wouldn’t be adorable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda flushed. Actually flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat kept walking, smirking.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen tilted her head behind her sunglasses. “Oh. That’s dangerous.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda rolled her eyes. “Shut up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia just giggled.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The wind had picked up just enough to make the umbrella tilt suspiciously every ten minutes, and Jen was on her fourth attempt to reposition it without cursing. She was failing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda lay beside her on a towel, one leg bent, nose in a paperback thriller, sunglasses on, pretending not to be invested in Jen’s war with gravity. Nat was out swimming again, effortlessly graceful in the waves like she belonged there. Lilia was nearby, standing on a half-buried cooler for signal. And a few feet away, Agatha was stretched on a towel, one hand shielding her eyes, the other flipping lazily through a magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze drifted over the group every few minutes, but she was mostly focused on the waves, until a suspiciously long silence made her glance toward the house.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     That, Agatha thought, is never good.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Ten minutes earlier, Rio had “gone to get more water,” which in Rio-language meant plotting something suspicious while pretending to be helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
     She’d found an old glitter-infused sunscreen in a basket under the sink, the kind meant for music festivals and wild college beach weekends, and paired it with a mischievous glint that spelled doom for someone.
     <br/>
     Maybe two someones.
    </p>
    <p>
     Targets acquired.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tiptoed barefoot across the sand, bottle in hand, sunglasses pushed low on her nose like she was sneaking into enemy territory.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda was reclined, deeply focused on her book. Jen had finally wrangled the umbrella into place and was now flat on her stomach, soaking up sun like a solar-powered plant.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, returning her gaze to the group just in time to spot Rio crouching low behind the towels, frowned deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” she muttered to no one, setting her magazine aside.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
     With expert speed, Rio squirted a thick line of shimmering sunscreen directly down both of their backs, one bold stripe each, followed by a dramatic squeaky “ta-da!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen jolted up. “WHAT, was that a jellyfish?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda twisted around and froze. “Why am I sparkly?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     From halfway down the beach, Rio was already sprinting backward, holding the glitter sunscreen bottle aloft like a trophy, cackling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You’re welcome!” she shouted. “Now you shine with inner AND outer light!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen stood, inspecting her shoulders in horror. “Rio. What did you do?!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Custom makeover!” Rio called. “You’re both ready for Coachella now!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda looked down at her shimmering chest and arms. “I’m going to kill you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed heavily and stood up, brushing sand from her thighs. “Every time,” she said under her breath. “Every single time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen turned, wide-eyed. “She glitter bombed me!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She glitter bombed both of you,” Agatha said dryly. “At least it’s not permanent dye this time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I sparkle,” Wanda said. “I look like a disco ball during Pride Month.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “And somehow she’s the one I fell in love with.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen blinked. “Seriously?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gave her a flat look. “You’re surprised now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Across the beach, Rio stood with both arms in the air like a victorious Olympian.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do I regret nothing? YES. Would I do it again? Also yes!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda was already marching toward her, sunscreen bottle in hand like a weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Revenge is a dish best served sticky!” she shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ve made worse choices!” Rio yelled, laughing as she bolted down the beach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen followed, shrieking. “I’m going to rub this in your HAIR, RIO!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia shouted from her cooler perch, “Someone film this!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nat finally looked up from the waves, smirking. “Do I even want to know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha just sat back down with a long sigh, reaching for her abandoned magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She’s a menace,” she muttered, but she was smiling, just barely.
    </p>
    <p>
     A little fond, a little tired. The kind of smile reserved only for someone who’s broken your peace and also holds your heart.
    </p>
    <p>
     Behind her, Rio dodged a tackle and yelled, “You sparkle because I CARE!”
    </p>
    <p>
     And Agatha murmured, “I need a drink.”
