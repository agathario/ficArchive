<div class="userstuff">
<p>When the email came in, announcing that her flight was canceled, Agatha nearly threw her phone at the wall.</p><p>It was roughly a week before Christmas, and while others might have taken the time to get last minute shopping done and see family, Agatha was in New Jersey of all places in order to meet with a particularly tetchy client. And of course, it had to be Agatha herself who went because this client saw himself as important, too good for anyone else but the CEO to come see, and while Agatha wasn’t usually one to soothe men’s egos, the amount of money he poured into her company was enough to warrant the trip.</p><p>Except now, Agatha was stuck. Thanks to the heavy snowfall, planes were grounded and trains were halted, but like hell was Agatha going to be stranded in fucking New Jersey of all places. </p><p>After threatening a car rental company, Agatha managed to get her hands on an SUV with snow tires. The workers tried several times to convince Agatha that it wasn’t safe to drive, but she didn’t listen. It was only a few hours drive to New York, and Agatha was willing to drive slow if it meant she wasn’t stuck pacing a hotel room for the night.</p><p>The roads were difficult as Agatha set off, but they weren’t impossible. Only a moderate level of danger, and as someone who’d grown up in the northeast, Agatha wasn’t phased by the snow. While driving, Agatha went through her mental catalogue of things that needed to be done once she was back in town. It wasn’t unusual for her to work through the holidays, and Agatha didn’t mind either. There was always something for her to do, and at least if she was the one to do it, she knew it would be done correctly.</p><p>Agatha was only about an hour into her drive when she found herself driving passing by a sign that read Westview. The population was under five thousand, and Agatha wrinkled her nose at the fact. A small town, how disgustingly quaint. </p><p>However, as Agatha drove down the icy road, a blur, an animal maybe, darted in front of her. </p><p>Reacting instinctively, Agatha hit the brakes and gave the wheel a hard turn. The sudden move sent Agatha’s car sliding off the road until the back half crashed into a nearby tree. Agatha’s head snapped forward with the momentum, smacking into her steering wheel first before reeling back into her head rest.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha groaned. She fumbled to undo her seatbelt. Once free, she reached up and gently probed her head. No blood, but god, it fucking hurt. “Fuck,” Agatha repeated. She tried to focus. What should she do? Help would be nice. She could call for help. That’s right. Agatha patted for her phone, but before she could pull it out, a figure appeared at her window.</p><p>Agatha would never admit it, but she screamed.</p><p>“Sorry! Sorry, wait! I’m not going to hurt you!”</p><p>Agatha blinked blearily, registering that it was a teenager standing by her car. A really skinny, pale boy who looked like he got into his mother’s make-up drawer. Probably not a serial killer. That was why Agatha unlocked the door and let Teen, her dizzied brain provided for her, help her out of her car.</p><p>“Who are you?” Teen asked.</p><p>“Who are you?” Agatha shot back, only to wince as her headache worsened.</p><p>Teen’s grip around her waist tightened, eyes widening. God, how old was this kid? “Are you okay?” Teen asked. He didn’t even let her answer before saying, “We’re not far from Dr. Vidal’s house. Can you walk?”</p><p>So, not even old enough to drive probably. Agatha’s life was in the hands of a child. Fantastic. She didn’t have much of a choice though, so she merely grimaced and forced herself to follow his slow footsteps. </p><p>It was only two or three blocks of walking, but Agatha felt about ready to pass out when Teen finally came to a stop. She looked up and squinted.</p><p>House was a generous term for the log cabin Dr. Vidal presumably resided in, but the pounding in her head didn’t seem to be going anywhere, so she didn’t really have a choice. Maybe if she was lucky the good doctor would have an actual degree and not just misplaced faith that he could heal all wounds. </p><p>Teen helped her up the steps before he pounded on the door, yelling, “Dr. Vidal! Dr. Vidal!” The loudness made Agatha’s eyebrows furrow. </p><p>It turned out Dr. Vidal wasn’t an aging man with a receding hairline and a penchant for isolation. Instead, a beautiful woman with brown hair and eyes answered the door, dressed in sweatpants and a sweater. </p><p>Dr. Vidal took in the sight of them, and Agatha had no idea what kind of picture she and Teen made, but it was enough for the woman’s eyes to go round. “What the,” she breathed, not even finishing her thought.</p><p>“I found her,” Teen explained. “Car accident near the edge of town.”</p><p>Dr. Vidal didn’t move for a second, most likely trying to understand what the hell was happening, not that Agatha could really blame her. She got the feeling that outsiders were a rare thing in this area. After a moment, Dr. Vidal gave a sharp nod and stepped back, saying, “Help her to the couch. I’ll get my bag.”</p><p>Teen did as he was told, and while Agatha would have preferred to shove him off and walk by herself, she could feel herself swaying. At the same time, she also felt jittery, like she might randomly twitch. That was probably the adrenaline. </p><p>Agatha sat down on the couch and glanced around while Teen disappeared. Despite being almost comically rustic, Agatha had to admit the cabin was cozy with a plush rug and colorful knick-knacks on every shelf and surface. It didn’t exactly give the impression a doctor lived here though. Then again, what did Agatha know about the aesthetics of doctors in towns in the middle of nowhere?</p><p>When Dr. Vidal showed up again, her hair was held back by a clip, and a pair of glasses were perched on her nose. She carried an old-fashioned physician’s bag with her, and just behind her, Teen followed with a glass of water. Dr. Vidal sat down beside her and started rummaging through her bag.</p><p>“We’ll start with the basics,” Dr. Vidal said as she pulled out a penlight and stethoscope. “Name and age?”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, fifty-one.”</p><p>Dr. Vidal nodded, going through what Agatha presumed was the normal procedure to make sure she wasn’t dying, like shining a light in her eyes and checking her breathing. “Good, and what were you doing before the crash, Ms. Harkness?”</p><p>“Driving,” Agatha replied sarcastically. At Dr. Vidal’s stern look, she sighed and said, “I was driving home to New York after a business meeting. My flight got canceled, so it was my only option.”</p><p>“Driving in the middle of one of the worst snow storms we’ve had this year was your only option?” Dr. Vidal asked, her tone making it very clear just how stupid she thought that was.</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Agatha said, “Sorry, but some of us would rather not spend any more time in New Jersey than we have to.” She obligingly went through the rest of Dr. Vidal’s tests though. When she was done, she asked dryly, “So, tell me, Dr. Vidal, am I going to make it?”</p><p>“By some miracle, yes,” Dr. Vidal snorted. “You do have a mild concussion though, so I’m afraid you’re not going to be driving anywhere for the next few days.”</p><p>“Are you kidding me?” Agatha huffed. She opened her mouth to protest, only to be hit with a wave of nausea. She winced and pressed a hand to her stomach. When it passed, she found Dr. Vidal watching her with a raised brow. “Oh, shut up,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Dr. Vidal smirked. She pulled a bottle of ibuprofen and handed her two pills. Agatha took them with the glass of water without question. Her head was still killing her. Dr. Vidal stood back up and started packing her things up again. As she did, she turned and addressed Teen, who’d been hovering anxiously for the last fifteen minutes. “What were you doing out there to even find her, Billy?” Rio asked with a knowing, admonishing tone.</p><p>Teen, no, Billy shrank at the question and shuffled his feet. “I was just taking a walk, Dr. Vidal. I needed to think.”</p><p>Dr. Vidal looked like she wanted to say something, but she ultimately just shook her head and said, “If you’re going to do that, stay closer to town, especially in weather like this, okay? I don’t want to have to treat you for pneumonia or frostbite if you freeze where no one can find you.” Billy gave her a goofy grin and salute in reply, and Dr. Vidal just laughed and said, “Go home, kid.” When Billy glanced at Agatha, Rio made a shooing gesture. “Our patient isn’t going anywhere. You’ll see her tomorrow.”</p><p>Billy pouted, but he still nodded. “I’m glad you’re okay,” he said to Agatha, and the sincerity of it threw her off.</p><p>“Uh, thanks,” Agatha said. “I’m glad I’m okay too.”</p><p>Billy gave her that same childlike grin he gave the doctor. He waved good-bye to her and left for the door. Dr. Vidal saw him out before she came back to the couch, sitting on the arm. “So, like I said, you’re not going anywhere, and Westview doesn’t have a hotel or anything like that.”</p><p>“At all?” Agatha asked, baffled.</p><p>Dr. Vidal shrugged and said, “Not really a need for one.” She stood up and held out her hand to Agatha, who reluctantly took it to help herself to her feet. She tried not to notice the callouses on the other woman’s hands and how they felt against her own smooth skin. “I have a guest room though. You’re more than welcome to stay there until you’re well enough to leave.”</p><p>“Is this the part where I have the misfortune to realize you’re going to kill me in my sleep, Dr. Vidal?” Agatha couldn’t help but snidely reply. It all just felt a little too perfect, a little too cliche. Because really, what do you mean the hot doctor just happened to have an open room for her in a town with no hotel? Agatha was convinced she was going to become the topic of a true crime podcast.</p><p>Rather than look offended, Dr. Vidal just laughed, “Hey, I’ve sworn the Hippocratic Oath.” She pressed a hand to her chest while raising the other. “Do no harm.” It was spoken with overdramatic seriousness that Agatha snorted. Dr. Vidal grinned and gestured for her to follow her down the hall. “It’s Rio, by the way,” she said, glancing over her shoulder. “I’ve told Billy a million times he can just call me by my first name, but he insists.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha repeated. It suited the woman.</p><p>“Here’s the room.”</p><p>It was a small room with a queen-sized bed and a small bookshelf in the corner and not much else. Agatha walked in and did a slow circle, taking it in. Rio watched her patiently. The bed looked comfortable at least, so Agatha guessed she couldn’t complain too much. She was only going to be here a day or two anyways. </p><p>“Good enough, New York?” Rio asked, a smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the tease, but she should have seen it coming after her jab at New Jersey. “It’ll do,” Agatha said. It was only then that it occurred to Agatha she didn’t have anything to sleep in, let alone any of her things. “My stuff–”</p><p>“I’ll run out and get it,” Rio cut her off, kind but firm. “I’ll get you something to sleep in for the night, but for now, just relax.” Agatha opened her mouth again, and seeming to read her mind, Rio continued, “I’ll call Alice to get your car and bring it to her shop first thing in the morning.” With that, she disappeared from the doorway. </p><p>Agatha sat on the edge of the bed, taking off her coat and shoes. She rubbed her forehead and grimaced. She wondered how the hell she ended up here. She didn’t have a good answer. As the headache lessened with the medicine, Agatha was struck by how exhausted she felt now. </p><p>Her eyes were beginning to droop just as Rio came back, carrying a pair of flannel pants and a soft sweatshirt. “Here you go,” Rio said. She handed her the clothes, and it wasn’t until she took them that Agatha realized she was carrying a few other things. Namely, a bottle of water, a bottle of ibuprofen, and a granola bar. Noticing Agatha’s stare, Rio explained, “I have to go into work tomorrow, so I might not be here when you wake up. These are the bare necessities, but help yourself to whatever.”</p><p>“Trusting a stranger alone in your house?” Agatha asked incredulously as Rio walked away. “Are you this nice to all of the people who crash their cars in your town?” </p><p>“Only the pretty ones,” Rio winked. “Good night, Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Later, she’d blame the concussion for this. It was the only explanation. It certainly had nothing to do with Rio’s attractiveness or kindness. </p><p>Rio paused in the doorway, smiling gently. “Agatha.”</p>

<p>When Agatha woke up, she forgot where she was for a moment. All she knew was that she was warm, curled under a heavy blanket, with sunlight streaming in from the window. It wasn’t until she registered the dull ache in her head and soreness in her limbs that she remembered the events from the night before.</p><p>Groaning quietly, Agatha forced herself to sit up and check her phone. It was already noon, and there were already ten missed calls from her assistant. She sent a succinct summary of what happened to her assistant before she tossed her phone aside. She rubbed her temples and tried to will the pain away. When she unsurprisingly failed, she reached for the ibuprofen Rio left for her.</p><p>It was after she swallowed the pills that she noticed her things were in a neat pile by the door, topped with a sticky note and a key. Easing herself out of bed, Agatha padded over and read the note.</p><p>
<em>Agatha, I hope you’re feeling better this morning. Here’s everything I got from your car, but if there’s anything else you need, find Alice. Town’s small, so just ask around. Here’s the key to my house in case you leave, but <u>TAKE IT EASY</u>. Take a nap or five. Avoid screens and caffeine. They’ll make the headache worse. My phone number in case you need me: 201-623-0991.  - Rio</em>
</p><p>Agatha snorted at the doctor’s instructions. It didn’t look like there was anything missing, but Agatha sure as hell wasn’t going to stay confined to this cabin all day. After grabbing some of her things, Agatha wandered out of the room and poked around until she found the bathroom.</p><p>One long, hot shower later, Agatha ate the granola bar Rio gave her and changed into a turtleneck and slacks. Her clothes in contrast to the cabin made her feel even more like she was not where she was supposed to be, but it was what she had. Besides, trapped in small town hell she may be, but Agatha didn’t have to stoop to their hick fashion. </p><p>After she drank another glass of water, Agatha slipped on her coat and headed into town. It was freezing outside, but Agatha stubbornly strode along the sidewalk. As she did, she noticed just how much it had snowed the previous night. Agatha bit back a curse. Concussion aside, it didn’t look like the roads were going to be ready for driving either.</p><p>Agatha’s first stop in town was Alice, who she assumed was the mechanic. Desperate to avoid unnecessary conversation, Agatha walked aimlessly until she found a building with a red roof and a sign that read: Gulliver’s Auto Repair. The garage was open, and there was her car. An Asian woman was inspecting it, a frown on her face. When she noticed Agatha walking up, she smiled and offered a wave.</p><p>“Agatha? I’m Alice.”</p><p>There was a brief handshake, and to Agatha’s relief, her hands were free of grease and oil.</p><p>“Well, I have good news for you,” Alice told her. “It was really just the back corner of your car that clipped the tree. Enough to bang your around, but as for damage to your car? A pretty easy fix.” She grinned when Agatha sighed in relief. “It’s a rental, right?” Agatha nodded, and Alice went over exactly what needed to be fixed, along with the costs. Apparently the rental company had already been apprised of what happened too, clearing up why Agatha hadn’t arrived with the car. </p><p>“How did you know which company to call?” Agatha asked. </p><p>“Rio found your receipt in your car,” Alice explained. “She was actually the one to call.”</p><p>Agatha furrowed her brows. That was another thing Rio had done for her. It was beginning to grate on her, just how much she owed this stranger. She didn’t ask her to do any of this. “Why would she do that?” Agatha wondered out loud.</p><p>“Because she’s Rio,” Alice said simply. It wasn’t a good enough answer though, and Agatha’s frustration must have been clear because Alice added, “Rio’s good people, that’s all.” She gave a little shrug and closed the hood of Agatha’s car with a definitive clang. </p><p>When Agatha couldn’t quite contain a shiver at a new breeze, Alice smiled sympathetically and changed the subject, saying, “Jen sells clothes about two blocks over. Nothing stylish, but it’s better than the Walmart thirty minutes away. I’m pretty sure she has some thermals you could layer. You might as well do some shopping while I work. It’ll be another day or two until I’m done.” </p><p>Letting out a heavy sigh, Agatha asked which direction to go in. </p><p>It was a short walk, just as Alice said, before Agatha found herself walking into a small store that must have been a house previously. It was redecorated since then, keeping only the exterior the same. Inside it was sleek and feminine, neat stacks of clothing here and shiny jewelry there. Agatha only made it a few steps in when a black woman walked out from the back. Her clothing was trendy, and her eyes were calculating as she glanced over Agatha. A name tag pinned to her chest identified as Jennifer. </p><p>“Nice sweater,” Jennifer said. “Merino wool?”</p><p>Despite being in a small town, where Agatha expected most wouldn’t know the difference between silk and cotton, this woman clearly knew her fashion. “Cashmere,” Agatha answered. </p><p>Jennifer raised an eyebrow. “What exactly is your job?”</p><p>“Business,” Agatha said curtly. She closed her coat tighter around her and glanced around. “Alice mentioned you might sell thermals.”</p><p>“Yeah, this way.”</p><p>Jennifer led her deeper into the house and pointed out a shelf against the back wall of the room where there were several stacks of thermals. While Agatha poked around to find her size, she could feel Jennifer’s eyes on her. She ignored her though. After some deliberation, Agatha decided to go with two shirts and two leggings. Hopefully, it would be overkill, but given how the weather was looking, she was going to need it. While she was at it, she grabbed a pair of jeans. She hadn’t packed much for this trip. </p><p>As Jennifer rang up the items at the front of the store, she said casually, “You’re not what I expected.”</p><p>“And what did you expect?” Agatha replied, wary yet irritated. </p><p>Jennifer just shrugged though. It was obvious she was thinking about something. She kept looking at Agatha like she was imagining someone else. Who, Agatha had no idea, and that was the most annoying part. </p><p>With her new purchases in hand, Agatha left the store with a glare thrown over her shoulder for good measure. She didn’t have any plans on where to go next, but her growling stomach soon led her to a modest-looking cafe with large windows and the smell of coffee coming from it. It was a simple place as Agatha walked in, but it was clean and charming.</p><p>An older woman with curls piled on the top of her head stood behind the counter, brightening when she saw her. “You must be Agatha,” she said.</p><p>“News really does travel fast in a small town, doesn’t it?” Agatha said with a tight smile. This was why she preferred cities. No one knew you, and no one gave a fuck about who you were.</p><p>The woman smiled back, saying, “Yes, but Rio also mentioned that you might stop by. I’m Lilia, by the way. The owner.”</p><p>A wave of displeasure hit her at Rio’s name. God, the woman really was everywhere. You would have thought she was the mayor, not the doctor. </p><p>Agatha shook Lilia’s hand and accepted the menu she handed her. It was all the kind of food you’d usually expect from a cafe, and after a swift look through the menu, she ordered tomato soup and a grilled cheese. She was hungry, but she was still a little queasy. The last thing she wanted was to throw up. Better to order something a little lighter than the burger she’d been eyeing.</p><p>Once she paid, Agatha sat herself at a table by the window, far from the main area of the cafe. There were only a few other people here, but Agatha didn’t want to risk them talking to her. While she waited for her food, Agatha tried to go through her work emails but ended up quitting after about ten minutes when her headache came back. </p><p>Huffing, Agatha stared out the window instead. With the fresh layer of snow from last night, Westview was a picturesque town. Every storefront had some kind of decoration for the holidays, whether it be garland, lights, signs, or everything aforementioned. As she watched, Agatha noticed that almost everyone said hi to one another when they walked past. None of the hunched shoulders and cold looks in the city. Everyone really did know everyone. A disturbing thought.</p><p>Movement from the corner of her eye made Agatha turn, assuming it was Lilia, but instead, it was Billy. He stood by her table, fidgeting with black fingernails. “Hi,” he said with a hesitant smile. “You’re okay.”</p><p>The way he said it, so earnestly, almost in disbelief, made Agatha wonder how much he’d seen last night. Did he see her car spin and hit the tree? It would make sense why he seemed so worried about her. Probably the scariest thing he’d seen since Casper the Friendly Ghost.</p><p>With a sigh, Agatha gave a small nod to the chair across from her. </p><p>Billy brightened and sat down, asking, “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Fine,” Agatha replied. “Headache’s annoying but that’s the worst of it.”</p><p>Lilia walked up to the table then. She set down Agatha’s food, along with a cup of tea she hadn’t asked for, and looked at Billy with fond exasperation. “Billy, aren’t you supposed to be in school?”</p><p>That was right. It was barely two on a Thursday. Agatha peered at the boy curiously.</p><p>Billy smiled sweetly at the older woman and said, “I’m only missing gym, Lilia, I swear.” </p><p>Lilia seemed to waver for a moment before she sighed and said, “If your mom asks, I didn’t condone this, kid.”</p><p>A strange look passed over Billy’s face, but it was gone quickly. Billy was back to grinning, saying, “Of course not. Thanks, Lilia.”</p><p>Agatha dipped her grilled cheese into her soup and took a bite, considering the boy in front of her. Between the walk in the snowstorm and skipping school, it seemed like there was more to Billy than met the eye. He certainly didn’t seem like a delinquent, but he was clearly up to something. Agatha swallowed her food and shrugged off the thought. Not her problem.</p><p>“Rio said you don’t call her by her first name, but you call Lilia by her first name,” Agatha observed. It seemed like a safer topic than whatever was really going on with him.</p><p>“Dr. Vidal just nags me,” Billy explained. “Lilia won’t feed me if I call her Ms. Calderu.” </p><p>Agatha nodded, a small amused smile on her lips. Lilia did seem the type to have things her way or not at all. She also didn’t seem above being tough on kids like Billy. Agatha liked her already. </p><p>As she finished her food, Billy happily, and unprompted, told her more about the town of Westview. It was a boring history, but it was nice background noise while she ate.</p><p>When there was a lull in his speech, Agatha asked, “What do you know about Rio?”</p><p>Billy blinked. “What do you mean?” </p><p>“Why did she, or you for that matter, help me last night?” Agatha said. She wiped the grease from her fingers and tossed her napkin aside with a flick of her wrist. “You have know idea who I am. I could be the worst person on the planet. I could eat babies.”</p><p>“Do you eat babies?” Billy asked, his lips twitching into a smile.</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss a beat. “Well, they are delicious,” she said.</p><p>Billy’s smile turned into a full grin as he laughed. He looked so young like that, and Agatha couldn’t help but imagine a different boy sitting across from her like this. The thought made Agatha flinch before she ruthlessly locked the thought away.</p><p>“I don’t know what you want me to say,” Billy said. “I did it because it was the right thing to do, and I’m pretty sure that’s why Dr. Vidal did it too. Everyone says she’s got rules she lives by, including helping others. That’s why she took over the clinic.”</p><p>Agatha mulled over the information, dubious about its truth. Surely, no one could be that much of a saint. “Do you know where her clinic is?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Again, Billy blinked at her, as if that was a stupid question. “Everyone does.” Okay, so maybe it was a stupid question.</p><p>“Take me there.” It wasn’t a request. </p><p>“But–”</p><p>“Now.”</p><p>As they left, Agatha got the confirmation that Billy could not, in fact, drive. It didn’t really matter though. The town was incredibly walkable, so Agatha had to give it that. Billy initially set off at a brisk pace with his stupidly long legs, but after noticing Agatha’s flushed face and furrowed brows, he slowed with an apologetic look. He thankfully didn’t apologize out loud. It was embarrassing enough that she couldn’t keep up. She was blaming the concussion for that one.</p><p>The clinic ended up being a brick building decorated by colorful string lights. Like every other part of this town, it looked like it’d been pulled straight from a storybook. Agatha followed Billy inside to find a dated but neat doctor’s office. </p><p>The receptionist smiled when she saw them. “Hi, Billy,” she said warmly. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Hi, Kate,” Billy replied. “I don’t know if Dr. Vidal told you, but there was a car accident yesterday.” He trailed off and waved at Agatha awkwardly. “And well.”</p><p>“I just need to talk to Dr. Vidal,” Agatha said, jumping in. This was getting painful to watch. “Is she free?”</p><p>“Sure, follow me.”</p><p>When Billy tried to come with her, Agatha grabbed his shoulder and spun him around. “No,” she said firmly. “Stay out here.”</p><p>Kate took her down a small hallway to the last door on the left. She knocked then opened it, revealing an office with books lining an entire wall. At the desk, Rio sat, dressed similarly to Agatha in a sweater and slacks. When she initially looked up, it was absent-minded, but as soon as she saw Agatha, she leapt from her desk.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said, sounding a touch breathless. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha stared at Kate until she got the message and left them with a mumbled good-bye. When the door shut behind her, Agatha folded her arms over her chest and glared at Rio.</p><p>“What?” Rio said. There was still concern on her face, but now she looked more confused. </p><p>“What’s the play here?” Agatha asked. When Rio continued to just stare at her, Agatha let out a harsh laugh. “I mean, there has to be an angle to all of this, right? Did you find out who I am? Are you hoping I’ll donate money to this sad, little town if you do all the right things?”</p><p>Rio leaned against the edge of her desk, her confusion only growing. “I’m not sure what you mean,” she said slowly. “I know who you are. You’re Agatha Harkness. You told me that yourself.”</p><p>Although she said her name, it was clear Rio had know idea what that name meant. </p><p>“Yes, but you know what I do, don’t you?” Agatha pressed. “My work, specifically. You know I’m the CEO of Salem Consulting.”</p><p>Infuriatingly, Rio still looked lost. “I do now?” Rio said with a helpless shrug of her shoulders. “What’s that have to do with anything?” </p><p>“It should have everything to do with this!” Agatha finally snapped. She was sick of this naive act that she was beginning to believe wasn’t an act at all, and that was a whole new kind of frustrating. “Everyone is nice here. You, especially, are nice. Too nice. It’s weird. No one is this nice unless they want something.”</p><p>“This isn’t New York.”</p><p>“I know this isn’t New York!”</p><p>“Agatha, calm down,” Rio said carefully, like she was some rabid animal to tame. She even held her hands up, palms towards her, as if to keep her at bay. “You still have a concussion. You don’t want to overexert yourself.”</p><p>“This is stupid,” Agatha seethed. “I’m fine! I’ve been up and walking around all day, and I’m not going to–”</p><p>Then, of course, Agatha completely proved Rio’s point and fainted.</p>

<p>Rio was the first thing Agatha saw when she woke up.</p><p>It took Agatha a moment to figure out where she was, but unfortunately, she’d recognize those wooden walls anywhere. They were back at the cabin. Blinking a few more times, Agatha realized they were in the guest room. Rio sat beside the bed in a chair that certainly hadn’t been there before.</p><p>How long had she been sitting there? </p><p>Rio had a book open in her lap, but she wasn’t reading it. Instead, she stared off into space with a crease between her brows. </p><p>Scrunching up her face, Agatha became all too aware of the lingering headache from her concussion. She didn’t remember it feeling this painful earlier. A quiet whine escaped her before she could stop it, drawing Rio’s attention.</p><p>The book was quickly closed and abandoned as Rio moved to sit on the edge of the bed. “Hey,” Rio said softly. She lifted a hand, hesitated, then rested it on Agatha’s arm. She rubbed it a few times before she picked up a glass of water from the side table. “Here, you’re probably a little dehydrated.”</p><p>Agatha drained the entire glass before she spoke. “What time is it?”</p><p>“A little after four,” Rio answered. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“This headache is a bitch,” Agatha grumbled as she passed Rio the glass back.</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched into a smile. “Yeah, well, that's your fault. I told you to take it easy today, but what did you do instead? Walked all around town and picked a fight with me for being too nice.” Although she was slightly chiding, Rio sounded more amused than anything. “I closed the clinic for the day, so I can make sure you don’t overdo it again.”</p><p>“I don’t need a babysitter,” Agatha said with a roll of her eyes. With a wince, she pushed herself up, so she was sitting up against the pillows. Rio didn’t move to help her, but she did watch her closely. </p><p>“Are you sure about that?” Rio replied. </p><p>Agatha wore a biting smile as she said, “I could ruin your life if you keep treating me like a child.”</p><p>Rather than be intimidated in any way, Rio just chuckled. She stood up and raised her eyebrows at Agatha, saying, “Sure, whatever you say, CEO Harkness. Because clearly, me, a doctor in a small town, cares so much about whatever money and influence you have in New York.” When Agatha reddened in anger at the teasing, Rio raised her hands in acquiesce. “Okay, I’m done. Now, can I interest you in a walk?”</p><p>“Oh, I’ve been downgraded from child to dog now?” Agatha asked petulantly. </p><p>“Is this your way of asking if I’ll call you ‘good girl’?” Rio said without missing a beat. An embarrassed smile spread across her face immediately after. She looked like she was going to take it back, but then she caught the new flush across Agatha’s cheeks and the smirk she couldn’t quite hide. Rio bit her lip, eyes alight with the information. Eventually, she cleared her throat and said, “So, a walk? Just to stretch your legs and get you some fresh air.”</p><p>“Aren’t I supposed to be taking it easy, like you’ve been incessantly nagging me to do all day?”</p><p>“It’ll be a leisurely walk.”</p><p>As much as Agatha didn’t want to go on a walk, she hated the idea of staying in bed more. Waving off Rio’s help, Agatha went to the restroom and freshened up. It wasn’t until she walked back out to the main area that she realized Rio had changed since earlier. Instead of a sweater and slacks, she wore a flannel, jeans and worn, lace-up boots, looking every bit the uncivilized townsperson. </p><p>Rio put on a barn coat and scarf too, and before they left, she handed Agatha a soft knit hat. When Agatha tried to say no, Rio said it was either the hat or one of her heavier coats. Agatha took the hat.</p><p>As they took off towards the trees, Agatha almost wished she’d taken the thicker coat. It was freezing out here. She refused to admit this though, wrapping her arms around herself as they walked. They barely hit the tree line when Rio threw her scarf at Agatha, hitting her directly in the face.</p><p>Ignoring Agatha’s glare, Rio said, “I used to walk these woods almost every day.”</p><p>It was an obvious attempt at conversation, not to mention a way to stop Agatha from arguing about the scarf. It was better than silence though, and Agatha had to admit the scarf was warm, so she humored the other woman. “You grew up here,” Agatha said.</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>“Did you ever think about leaving?”</p><p>“All the time,” Rio said, and Agatha found her eyes widening at the easy admission. Rio caught her expression and laughed. “Don’t look so surprised. I was young once.”</p><p>“You’re still young,” Agatha scoffed. “What are you, thirty-something?”</p><p>Rio grinned, “Forty, actually. Just last month.” </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes at the technicality. She let them walk a little further before she asked, “So why did you stay?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer immediately. For the first time since Agatha had met her, Rio’s easy smile was replaced by something solemn. Inexplicably, Agatha wanted to take the question back. It was a strange feeling. That wasn’t like her at all. She always liked to push and push until she knew every little detail of every little thing. Agatha was ruthless about knowing all of the facts of a situation. And yet, she couldn’t bring herself to probe.</p><p>After a few minutes of silence, Rio finally said, “My father passed away when I was eighteen. Car accident. My mom passed away just a few years before that when I was fourteen. Cancer. Just like that, I was alone in the world.” Her voice was quiet but steady as she spoke. This was something that still hurt to talk about, but it didn’t hurt as much as it used to. Agatha was familiar with the feeling. “I wasn’t alone at all though. Everyone in town helped me out. A lot of people dropped off food, sad casseroles and stuff. Some people just wouldn’t take my money for things, like Alice’s dad at the auto shop. It’s like… They took care of all the little things that felt too overwhelming altogether.</p><p>“I ended up commuting to the nearest university, got my degree, and then I left town for a while for medical school. The whole time though? There wasn’t a question about whether I’d come back. These people… They’re the reason I’m here.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, understanding her a little better now. “Kindness.”</p><p>“Paying it forward,” Rio said with a faint smile. “Even to people who eat babies.”</p><p>It took Agatha a second to understand, and when she did, she snorted. “Billy told you about that?”</p><p>“Thought it’d be fair to warn me about the kind of woman I let into my house,” Rio explained, grinning.</p><p>Agatha matched her smile for a brief moment before it faded into contemplation. “You’re lucky,” she said, more to herself than Rio. “That you weren’t alone.” </p><p>Agatha had barely been thirty-five when her son Nicholas died. She remembered how it felt to be lost in your grief, so much that it felt suffocating, like there was nothing else but that one, exhausting feeling. Agatha hadn’t had a town to rally behind her though. She hadn’t even had a mother or a partner. Just herself and an empty bedroom.</p><p>“I am,” Rio said, pulling Agatha from her thoughts. She looked at Agatha with a look in her eye, almost like she’d known what Agatha was thinking. </p><p>Rio didn’t seem like she would ask, but just to make sure she wouldn’t, Agatha asked, “Do you ever regret staying?”</p><p>Much like before, Rio didn’t speak for a while. When she finally did, she merely said, “Let’s head back now. I think I’ve kept you out here long enough.”</p><p>When they got back to the cabin, Agatha found herself relegated to the couch while Rio cooked them dinner. Although her pride chafed against being taken care of like this, Agatha could feel the beginnings of exhaustion begin to tug at her. So, Agatha stayed on the couch in front of a real, lit fireplace with the soft murmurs of jazz playing from a speaker.</p><p>Rio was quiet when she started cooking, but as she cut some vegetables, she hesitantly asked Agatha about the kind of food she ate in New York. It was light and easy conversation, laden with teasing from both of them about the other’s taste. Agatha enjoyed it, but she also couldn’t help but wonder if Rio kept it so casual after she didn’t answer her question earlier.</p><p>Dinner ended up being simple, roasted chicken with vegetables, but it was well-seasoned and well-cooked, and Agatha ended up eating everything on her plate. While they ate, the conversation remained forcibly light, drifting from food to music to movies.</p><p>“We’re watching one tonight,” Rio said when she found out Agatha wasn’t fond of Christmas movies. “I’ll pick one out while you shower.”</p><p>“Didn’t you say screens were bad for me?” Agatha shot back.</p><p>Rio pursed her lips, looking conflicted. “Now you want to follow my advice?”</p><p>“I’m just listening to my doctor,” Agatha said, fluttering her eyelashes.</p><p>Rio blushed, but she shook her head and said, “You can close your eyes and listen. Go shower.”</p><p>While it was warm in the cabin, it wasn’t warm enough for the thin t-shirt and pants Agatha had packed for this trip. Agatha frowned and grabbed the same pajamas Rio had loaned her from the other night. Even though she’d just showered in the morning, Agatha let out a sigh of contentment when the hot water hit her muscles. They’d loosened throughout the day, but the water certainly helped.</p><p>When Agatha walked into the living room, Rio was waiting for her with two mugs of tea. She noticed Agatha’s clothing, and instead of making some smart remark, she simply said, “I’ll give you a clean set tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha smiled her thanks and accepted the mug handed to her. The couch was small with throw pillows on either end, so she had no choice but to see close to Rio in the middle. Close enough that their arms brushed as Rio put on the movie she insisted on.</p><p>“This is a classic,” Rio informed her. A moment later, the stop motion version of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer came on. A wave of longing hit Agatha, more than she expected. She hadn’t watched this in years. Not since she used to watch it with her little boy. Her grip tightened around her mug. For a moment, she considered asking Rio to change the movie, even if it meant getting questions. Before she could decide, Rio’s hand was suddenly covering her eyes. “No screens, remember? Close your eyes.”</p><p>“It’s no fun if I don’t get to watch,” Agatha argued.</p><p>“So you admit Christmas movies are fun?” Rio wore a cheeky grin.</p><p>Agatha fought back a smile. “Are we going to watch it or not?”</p><p>There was something distinctly cozy about the stop motion films, even if the Island of Misfit Toys had given Nicholas nightmares. Agatha finished her tea quickly then settled more comfortably into the couch as she watched the reindeers tease Rudolph.</p><p>Agatha could feel her eyelids growing heavy, but she refused to mention this. She could make it through this movie. It was barely an hour. She was fine. However, as the movie went on, her head started bobbing. It wasn’t until a light pressure on the side of her head made her lay against Rio’s shoulder, letting her rest securely. After that, Agatha was asleep within minutes.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha was beginning to wonder just how many times she was going to wake up in this bed with no memory of how she got here. It’d only been twice so far, but it was two more times than she would’ve liked. </p><p>The last thing she remembered was watching the movie on the couch with Rio. Had she carried her in here? That had to be what happened, but Agatha couldn’t imagine the other woman lifting her. Then again, Agatha ended up here after she fainted too. The difference was that Agatha woke up with barely a headache this time.</p><p>Shaking her head, Agatha begrudgingly got up to get ready for the day. With her last clean sweater, Agatha wore her new jeans and thermals. Her hair was messier than usual, wavy in some places and straighter in others, and after fussing with it, she eventually left it alone. It didn’t matter anyways. Who was going to judge her hair in this town?</p><p>Agatha grabbed her phone, and after squinting for a minute, she grabbed her glasses as well. There were an ungodly number of unread emails waiting for her, but she stuck to the important ones. One of which included all of the board members, requesting Agatha have the next few days off to recover from her car accident. Apparently everyone was conspiring against her, so she could “take it easy.” Never before had three words irritated her so badly.</p><p>Once the necessary emails were answered, the smell of coffee and food brought Agatha out of her room. </p><p>With her back to her, Rio stood at the stove, cooking. Today, she wore a green flannel that should have looked downright stupid, but instead, Agatha’s hands twitched with the urge to touch it. She squashed the sudden desire and cleared her throat as she walked into the kitchen.</p><p>Rio turned around, only to do a double take. As she did so, her hand drifted down without her realizing it. “Shit,” Rio hissed when her wrist grazed the hot pan. She tossed aside the spatula she was holding and ran to the sink to run her skin under cold water. “Morning,” Rio said awkwardly, clearly trying to act like she hadn’t just burned herself. “You’re wearing glasses.”</p><p>“I am,” Agatha agreed. </p><p>Although she couldn’t be sure, she had a pretty good idea what caused the reaction. To test her theory, she adjusted her glasses. Rio’s eyes followed the movement as if hypnotized. Agatha tried not to smile as she inched towards the coffee maker. Rio noticed and smirked, giving her a small nod. Agatha’s shoulder sagged in relief. She hurried over to the machine and grabbed the mug Rio had left out for her, a chipped blue one. Agatha couldn’t even bring herself to care. As soon as she took a sip, she felt a little more at ease. Something normal for her in a completely not normal situation.  </p><p>“You weren’t wearing them yesterday,” Rio said, and it took Agatha a moment to remember what she was talking about. </p><p>“That’s because they’re reading glasses. I was answering some emails before I came out here,” Agatha explained, not bothering to hide her smile now. What an odd thing to find attractive. Well, at least now she knew to wear them if she needed to convince Rio of something. She took another sip of coffee then asked, “Don’t you have work today?”</p><p>Rio shook her head and went back to the stove. “Clinic’s closed today,” she said. “Whole town is pretty much. It’s the winter festival today.”</p><p>“You’re kidding,” Agatha said with a laugh. She couldn’t fathom the idea of an entire town shutting down for the day for something as frivolous sounding as a winter festival.</p><p>“Nope,” Rio said, disturbingly serious. She nodded at the kitchen table, where Agatha noticed already had plates and food on it. “Now, eat your pancakes.”</p><p>Over breakfast, Rio explained what exactly the winter festival was. It was essentially an all-day event where local businesses and schools held activities and booths to raise money for various things. A glorified fundraiser. That was what Agatha’s life had come to.</p><p>“What if I just stayed here?” Agatha tried, even as she shrugged on her coat and accepted both the hat and scarf from yesterday. After debating for a minute, she left her glasses in the guest room. “I could just stay here and relax.”</p><p>“You’ll have to forgive me if I find that hard to believe after yesterday,” Rio replied. She tugged on a beanie that looked cuter than it should’ve and grinned, not helping Agatha’s heart rate at all. “Just give it a chance, Agatha. Maybe that grinch heart of yours can grow a size or two.”</p><p>“It definitely won’t now,” Agatha said, “but since I don’t have much of a choice, lead the way.”</p><p>When Rio drove up to an outdoor ice skating rink fifteen minutes later, Agatha laughed. Loudly.</p><p>“Stop that,” Rio said, but she was laughing too. “I’m definitely not trusting you on the ice.”</p><p>“Then why are we even here?”</p><p>Rio lifted her chin and said, “Not everything revolves around you, you know. We’re here because I want to skate.”</p><p>“You should’ve left me at–” Agatha stopped abruptly, realizing she almost said ‘home’.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem to notice her pause though, saying, “It’ll still be fun, I swear. Maybe not as fun as skating, but there’s hot cider and snacks.” Her eyes lit up as she added, “Oh, and hot chocolate.” It wasn’t endearing at the least. Not at all. Neither was the way everyone seemed to greet Rio like she was a minor celebrity, making the other woman blush.</p><p>There were tables and chairs set up next to the ice rink, and Rio set Agatha up at one of them with cups of both hot cider and hot chocolate. Along with those, Rio brought her a coloring sheet and a set of crayons that were clearly meant for children. When Agatha glared at her, Rio just smirked and said, “So you don’t get too bored.”</p><p>It turned out Agatha didn’t need the crayons at all though. There was no way she would have been bored while watching Rio on the ice. The woman was clearly comfortable, gliding around with ease. Much like when they were walking in, everyone said hello to her as she skated past. Sometimes, Rio would even move backwards for a while, talking to someone. </p><p>Rio skated for about almost an hour, and Agatha didn’t look away once. Eventually noticing her gaze, Rio blew her a kiss. A few kids near her on the ice giggled, and Rio blushed and tripped when she realized someone other than Agatha saw. Agatha bit her lip, trying to act unaffected. </p><p>When she rejoined her, Rio was flushed and beaming, and it wasn’t fair of her to look that good when she should have been sweaty and gross.</p><p>“Ready for the main event?” Rio asked as they got into the car. </p><p>“Pig racing?” Agatha guessed sarcastically. </p><p>“No, that’s only in the summer.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her incredulously. “I was joking.”</p><p>“I wasn’t,” Rio said with a grin. It was impossible to tell if she was lying. Rio shrugged, still not letting on as she said, "In both seasons, we have a carnival though.”</p><p>“You’re trying to kill me,” Agatha muttered. As charming and attractive as Rio was, being dragged around a pathetic carnival was not her idea of a good time. Maybe she could fake faint to get out of it.</p><p>Rio wore a half-smile, eyes firmly on the road. Her fingers drummed on the steering wheel. “Do no harm, remember?” </p><p>“I’m beginning to think you crossed your fingers when you made that oath,” Agatha retorted, and Rio just laughed. </p><p>After parking at the clinic, Rio led Agatha to the town square where the carnival was happening. Agatha purposefully dragged her feet at first, trying to delay her inevitable participation in this inane event, but Rio was having none of that. Her hand grasped Agatha’s, warm despite the cold weather, and tugged her forward. Agatha was glad that Rio walked slightly in front of her, so she missed the way Agatha’s cheeks had reddened when she held her hand. </p><p>Carnival turned out to be the only accurate way to describe the poorly constructed booths, consisting of trivial games and unhealthy foods. Agatha was less than impressed, but Rio hadn’t let go of her hand, using it to take her from booth to booth. </p><p>Similar to how it was at the ice rink, everyone greeted Rio warmly and by name at every booth they went to. Rio seemed to know everyone’s names too, and Agatha found herself simply observing while Rio made small talk with every single person. It shouldn’t be too surprising, she supposed. Rio was what seemed like the only doctor in town, but Agatha was also fairly certain that it wasn’t a requirement for your doctor to remember what kind of dog you owned or the fact that your eight year-old had a recital at school this week.</p><p>“Do you go to every event this town holds?” Agatha asked as Rio stepped up to a booth for ring toss. </p><p>“Usually,” Rio said. “It helps to be supportive of whatever the town does. They do pay my bills.” Rio said this last part with a playful grin, making the teenager working the booth laugh. “Don’t tell your mom I said that, Julie,” Rio mock-whispered as she took the handful of rings. Then, with uncanny precision, she somehow made all but one ring land around the neck of the bottles line up. “Impressed?” Rio asked, noticing Agatha’s stare.</p><p>“Not at all,” Agatha lied.</p><p>Rio accepted a small stuffed rabbit from the teenager and held it out to her. “Not even now?”</p><p>“You’re going to have to do more than that to impress me,” Agatha said, but she still took the rabbit and tucked it into the crook of her arm.</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Rio said, taking her hand once more. “I still have the whole afternoon.”</p><p>They spent the afternoon wandering around the different booths, resting on a bench to eat an early dinner and listen to the high school’s band play. They were atrocious, and Agatha said so to Rio. To her amusement, Rio glanced around before admitting she agreed. “I try to avoid any concerts,” Rio murmured to her, and Agatha had to muffle a laugh.</p><p>By early evening though, Agatha found herself feeling more than a little tired. Most likely a lingering side effect from the concussion, but she found herself annoyed nonetheless. She didn’t want to admit her exhaustion either, but Rio seemed to pick up on the fact anyways.</p><p>“Come on,” Rio said. She squeezed her hand and led her away from the crowds. “There’s one more thing I want to show you.”</p><p>It was hard to tell where Rio was taking them, especially in the dark, but eventually, Agatha noticed the iron fence and tombstones. She dug her heels in and said, “This isn’t funny.” Agatha made sure her tone conveyed just how serious she was, but when Rio looked over her shoulder, there wasn’t a trace of humor on her face.</p><p>“I’m not trying to be,” Rio said. She squeezed Agatha’s hand again before she adjusted their hands, entwining their fingers. “Just trust me.”</p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw. She hated cemeteries, not that she thought anyone really liked them, but she had a lot of reasons to hate them. Still, Agatha let Rio walk her through this one. They only walked for a minute or two before they stopped in front of a grave with fresh flowers laid across it.</p><p>“Sharon Davis,” Rio said with a nod to the headstone. Her hand was still holding Agatha’s, but she resolutely stared at the headstone, avoiding eye contact. “It’s been about a month since she passed, but I still come out here when I can. I knew her all my life. I saw her when she used to come to the clinic to see my dad, and I saw her when she came to the clinic to see me.”</p><p>Rio took a deep breath, and when it came out, it was tremulous. “You asked if I ever regretted staying here, and sometimes, I do.” She ducked her head, and Agatha caught a glimpse at the tears gathering in her eyes. Her voice was wrought with grief as she said, “What my dad never told me about this job is how much it fucking sucks when someone dies. It’s not often. It’s usually of old age. But it still really hurts. I know everyone in this town since I’m the only doctor, and that just means it hurts even more when they die.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to tell Rio to stop, that she didn’t need to know, but she felt Rio’s grip tight around her hand. It wasn’t painful, but it was… grounding. Agatha pressed her lips together and listened as Rio continued, “I hate it so much that it’s hard to breathe, knowing I’ll have to watch a lot of good people die. That’s why I can’t leave though. I can see why other people would hate it, but it means something to know these people and help them, especially in the last years of their lives. I’m not some random doctor they managed to schedule. I’m the doctor that’s been taking care of them since I was thirty.” Rio let out a ragged laugh. “It’s also why I hate that I stayed sometimes because it’s not fair that I have to watch it.”</p><p>For a moment, the only sounds were Rio’s unsteady breaths and sniffles.</p><p>Agatha found herself at a loss for what to say or do. Rio had just laid herself bare to Agatha of all people, and she couldn’t help but feel undeserving of it. She hadn’t intended Rio to tell all of us this when she asked that question. All Agatha meant to do was make sure Rio didn’t ask her anything.</p><p>It only felt fair to share something in return, even if it was something Agatha loathed to talk about. Then again, who else would understand her grief? The feeling of being trapped? It wasn’t the same, but it was similar, enough that Agatha felt her mouth opening before she could stop herself. </p><p>“My son died, a little over fifteen years ago,” Agatha said. The words came out stilted and pained. She couldn’t remember the last time she willingly talked about him. “He loved Christmas, like most little kids do. He loved it so much, and we’d do every little tradition together, so when he died, I never celebrated Christmas again.” Agatha felt tears prick at the corners of her eyes as Rio’s thumb stroked the back of her hand. This felt like a confession, admitting to the part of her she’d locked away. “I don’t hate it though. It just hurts. And while I think your town’s traditions are rather ridiculous, I know Nicky would have loved every single one.” The last part was delivered with a watery laugh that Rio matched.</p><p>Rio said nothing at first, but then she asked gently, “How old was he?”</p><p>“Six,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio nodded, almost to herself. She tugged on Agatha’s hand, pulling her towards her. Agatha could have stopped her if she wanted. She could have let go of her hand and laughed it off, throwing her walls back up where they belonged. Agatha didn’t though. She fell against Rio as she wrapped her arms around her. Agatha buried her face into Rio’s shoulder and tried to ignore the tears that fell. </p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I’m sorry too.”</p><p>When Rio pulled away, she stared at Agatha, arms still wrapped around her. She was close enough that Agatha could feel the warmth of her breath against her face and the way she trembled from the cold. Rio leaned in ever so slightly, and Agatha’s eyes fell shut in anticipation of a kiss. </p><p>It never came though. Rio’s arms fell away from her as she stepped back. When Agatha opened her eyes again, Rio’s face was twisted in a grimace, almost at war with itself. Finally, Rio sighed and said, “Let’s head back to my place. You’ve been out all day.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to grab her and demand what the hell that was. She wanted to hold her face and kiss her until she forgot they were in the middle of New Jersey for god’s sake. Agatha wanted to do a hundred different things, but instead, her arms hung by her side, and all she said was, “Okay.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>On her fourth day in Westview, Agatha found herself, for lack of a better word, brooding.</p><p>What else was she supposed to do when Rio and this stupid town had her all twisted up?</p><p>After a tension-filled car ride last night, Agatha and Rio had said good night in the hallway before going to their respective rooms. As Agatha had gone to bed, all she could think about was them in the cemetery, the way Rio had looked at her. She knew she hadn’t imagined things. They almost kissed.</p><p>What annoyed Agatha even more was just how bothered she was that they hadn’t kissed. It shouldn’t have mattered that Rio didn’t kiss her. Rio was no one, just some doctor in a small town that most people had never heard of. Meanwhile in New York, Agatha had some of the elite falling over themselves for a chance to take her to dinner. And yet… Agatha was still thinking about Rio’s arms around her.</p><p>By the time Agatha finally dragged herself out of bed, it was nearly noon. It was something Agatha would have never done at home, always up early for work, but with nothing and no one to bother her, Agatha had stayed huddled under the covers for as long as possible.</p><p>The cabin was empty when Agatha walked out of the bathroom, dressed and ready for the day. With the festival over, Rio had gone to work and left her a note. It didn’t elude Agatha that she left it by the coffee machine.</p><p>
<em> Agatha,  </em>
</p><p><strike><em>About last night</em> </strike><em> I<strike>f you want to talk</strike></em><em><strike> </strike> Thank you for last night. I wanted to talk this morning, but you were still knocked out. Did you know you drool? Anyways, your head should be just fine now, but try to relax. You’re technically on vacation, right? I’ll be at the clinic until 5, but call if you need anything. Even if it’s just to talk. </em> </p><p>Instinctively, Agatha had wanted to crush the flimsy paper in her hand and hide the evidence of whatever was happening between her and Rio. After a deep breath though, Agatha pocketed the note and poured herself some coffee.</p><p>It would have been easy to stay in the cabin, just as she was just begging Rio to let her do the day before, but Agatha found herself getting antsy within an hour. With nothing better to do, Agatha grabbed her coat and went to check on her car. </p><p>The walk was brisk and brief, but it was enough to make Agatha feel a little less trapped. Alice was there again, garage open but working on a different car this time. Although she looked surprised to see her, she still smiled at Agatha as she walked up. </p><p>“Hey,” Alice greeted her warmly. “I was going to give you a call later, but I’m just waiting on one more part, and by tomorrow afternoon, your rental should be good to go.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said quietly. </p><p>When Agatha made no move to leave, Alice eyed her curiously but said nothing. She left Agatha there as she continued to work on the car. A few minutes passed before Agatha finally blurted out, “Do you like this?” </p><p>Alice paused and glanced up at her. “Being a mechanic? It’s fine.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, eyebrows scrunched together. “Living here.”</p><p>To her surprise, Alice seemed to seriously consider her question before answering. “I do,” Alice said. She set down her tool and grabbed a rag, absently wiping her hands. “My parents moved us here when I was about thirteen? I hated it at first. Small towns with small minds, you know?” Agatha gave a hum of understanding. “But… I don’t know. There are still some assholes, but those are everywhere, and the people who aren’t assholes, well, they make it worth it.”</p><p>“Don’t you ever want more?”</p><p>“More than a steady job, a girlfriend, and some friends?” Alice replied, but it was said kindly. She shrugged. “I could do with a little less pep and fewer stupid holidays, but I don’t think I need much more than that. Jen’s mentioned moving every once in a while, but we never go through with it.” Alice flashed her a smile and added, “That’s just us though.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow at the realization Alice and Jennifer were dating, but she still mumbled her thanks and excused herself to head to the cafe.</p><p>She didn’t understand these people. She wasn’t sure she ever would. She couldn’t wrap her head around the way they were also so content with their lives in this insignificant town. Everything they did was so miniscule in the grand scheme of things, so irrelevant. It didn’t matter that their town shut down for the day for a stupid festival; stocks weren’t affected, businesses across the globe weren’t scrambling to cover for them, and the world still turned.</p><p>For so long, for fifteen years since Nicholas’s death, Agatha had only ever tried to find meaning in her life. To be someone. And she thought she had. She was CEO of a major consulting company. Others relied on her to keep their careers going, to keep their enterprises running. Agatha mattered. Yet, she didn’t seem to feel even a fraction of the happiness these people in Westview did.</p><p>With a small huff, Agatha walked into Lilia’s cafe and ordered herself a burger and fries. She deserved one after these last few days. The older woman made small talk with her while she paid, but Agatha could only somewhat pay attention. She was still stewing over the upheaval in her mind.</p><p>Just like last time, Agatha took a seat by the window, and just like last time, Billy appeared as she was finishing her meal. She raised an eyebrow at him, but he just smiled innocently and stole a fry off her plate. Agatha rolled her eyes and sent him away to order her a cup of tea.</p><p>When he returned five minutes later with her drink and a hot chocolate for himself, Billy looked pensive. The two of them sat in companionable silence for a few minutes before Billy took a deep breath and said,  “Can I ask you something?” When Agatha gave him a small nod, he asked, “How did you know who you are?”</p><p>“Do you mean a lesbian?” Agatha couldn’t help but joke.</p><p>Billy didn’t laugh though. His eyebrows were tightly knitted together as he stared down at his drink. Agatha’s easy smile faded into a similar contemplation. She knew something was up with this kid from the first night they met, and it looked like she was finally going to find out what was going on.</p><p>After a few more minutes of silence, Billy said quietly, “I found out I’m adopted recently. My parents…” He shook his head and sighed. “They’re still my parents, but I’m not their son.” The last part came out strained, and Billy looked like he was fighting back tears. “Everything I thought I knew was a lie.”</p><p>For a moment, Agatha wondered why this boy decided to dump this on her of all people before it occurred to her that she was probably the only person in this town without a connection to his parents. Or, well, his adopted parents. Sighing, Agatha took a long sip of her tea, mulling over his situation. “Is it though?” Agatha asked. When Billy just stared at her in confusion, she clarified, “A lie.”</p><p>“Of course it is,” Billy said quickly.</p><p>“Oh, so they aren’t the people who fed and clothed and raised you?” Agatha countered. “Are you saying they didn’t, don’t, love you?” Agatha almost grinned at the angry, sour look Billy gave her. Served him right for acting like such a brat over this. Agatha let a little smirk pull at her lips though as she said, “Oh don’t give me that look. That’s what you were implying, no?”</p><p>“I thought I knew everything.”</p><p>“Want to know a secret?” Agatha said, leaning forward. Her smile was gentle and sympathetic for once. “That’s just how it is. You’re always going to think you know everything, and then something will happen and suddenly you don’t know anything.”</p><p>Billy shifted in his seat. “That’s not very reassuring.”</p><p>“It wasn’t meant to be. It’s just the truth.”</p><p>“I guess.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, tapping her fingers against her mug. “Listen, kid,” she said. “You’re allowed to be mad or upset or whatever you’re feeling about finding this out, but don’t twist this into something it’s not. If your parents love you and treat you well, then this is something you’ll all work past.” Her voice softened as she added, “It’s important to remember to cherish what you have.”</p><p>Billy looked sharply at her, but something on her face stopped him from asking. Instead, he downed half of his hot chocolate and sighed. “Fine,” Billy said. “Will you help me find gifts for them then?”</p><p>With nothing better to do, Agatha agreed. She spent the afternoon walking around Westview with Billy, visiting all of the different stores. As they shopped, Billy explained that his family was Jewish, but he still liked to buy his parents something small. It was sweet, if she was being honest, but there was no way she was going to tell him that. Instead, she insulted most of his suggestions. It was necessary though. He had some awful taste.</p><p>Eventually though, Billy found a decorative dish for his mother’s jewelry and a pair of gloves for his father. Billy beamed at her as he bought them, saying, “Thanks for the help. You’re pretty good at this.”</p><p>“There’s not much I’m bad at,” Agatha replied.</p><p>When they said good-bye for the day, Billy darted forward and gave her a clumsy hug. It was  quick, over before Agatha could even process what was happening. Billy grinned shyly at her and said, “Thanks again, Agatha. Tell Dr. Vidal I said hi.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, even as she smiled, and said, “Good-bye, Billy. Don’t get into too much trouble.” She watched him walk away, imagining what Nicholas would have been like. Tall like him? Sweet and insecure? Bold and confident? Agatha sighed, feeling that familiar pang.</p><p>Her head was beginning to hurt, and it had nothing to do with the car accident.</p><p>Agatha headed back to the cabin, checking the time on her phone. It was just half past five, so Rio was probably there already. The thought made Agatha take a deep breath. Trudging through the snow, she forced herself to face the facts. She didn’t know what she wanted in life anymore, but she knew she wanted Rio, even if it was just for now.</p><p>Nodding to herself, Agatha walked the rest of the way and let herself back into the cabin. Jazz music greeted her, along with the faint scent of bacon. She took off her shoes and coat and found Rio in the kitchen, stirring a pot of what looked like soup.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said when she saw her. Her entire face lit up in a smile, and Agatha felt her heart swoop at the sight of it. Oh, this was worse than she thought. “How was your day?” </p><p>It all felt so painfully domestic, and to Agatha’s surprise, she didn’t hate it. She padded closer and looked over Rio, wearing jeans, a flannel, and fuzzy socks. It should have been stupid. It was stupid, but Agatha also couldn’t help but find it cute too. Now that she came to her conclusion, Agatha wanted to do something about it.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha remembered to answer. “Yours?”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said. She turned back to the pot and peered at it as she continued, “It was a pretty slow day, just some common colds really. During lunch, I–”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha cut her off, stopping right in front of her.</p><p>Rio froze and looked up at her, eyebrows furrowed. “What’s wrong, Agatha?”</p><p>Before she could overthink it, Agatha cupped Rio’s face and kissed her. It was a chaste kiss, but Agatha still felt her lips tingling as she pulled away. She searched Rio’s face for any sign of disgust. “Was that okay?” Agatha still asked. It took a moment for Rio’s eyes to open again, and when they did, a slow smile accompanied the action. </p><p>“More than okay,” Rio murmured. She wrapped her fingers around Agatha’s wrists and kissed her again, deepening it. It was slow and unhurried, far different from the kinds of kisses Agatha was used to. Agatha sighed as she slid her hands into Rio’s hair, tangling the dark strands around her fingers. </p><p>“Turn off the stove,” Agatha said once they broke the kiss. “Dinner can wait.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate to do as she said.</p><p>It would’ve been easier and faster to just walk to Rio’s room normally, but now that Agatha had tasted Rio, she couldn’t pull herself away. They stumbled down the hall, refusing to stop kissing for another moment, and once they were inside, Agatha wasted no time pushing Rio onto the bed and straddling her.</p><p>“God, you’re beautiful,” Rio whispered, staring up at her with wide eyes.</p><p>“Be honest, how long have you been thinking about this?” Agatha teased, rocking against her.</p><p>Rio bit down on her lip, exhaling slowly. Her hands moved along Agatha’s thighs before squeezing her ass. “A while,” she answered slowly.</p><p>“Mm, and how long is a while?” Agatha pressed kisses down her neck and nipped playfully right over her pulse. She smiled when Rio bucked beneath her. “Honestly, I thought it was a joke, you being both a doctor and this attractive.” Agatha dragged her tongue up Rio’s neck until her lips were pressed to her ear. “And somehow you just got hotter, even in your stupid flannel.”</p><p>Rio laughed breathlessly, “You love my stupid flannel.” Her hands toyed with the hem of Agatha’s sweater before slipping underneath. </p><p>“I hate it,” Agatha replied without missing a beat. She pulled back enough to smirk at her. “I think you should take it off.”</p><p>Rio poked her tongue to the side of her mouth, smiling. She pushed Agatha back enough to sit up. She held her gaze as her hands went to the buttons, and one by one, she undid them until she revealed a simple black bra.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha purred. She pushed the flannel off and drank in the sight of Rio below her. As she leaned in to kiss her, Agatha said, “It’s sexy that you just do what I say. What else will you do for me?”</p><p>Rio’s answering moan was answer enough, and Agatha pushed her back down onto the bed.</p><p>As she lost herself in Rio, Agatha forgot about everything else. All that mattered was this beautiful, maddening woman. </p>

<p>
<span>The muffled chime was what woke Agatha up.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha went to grab her phone, only to feel a heavy arm around her waist and realize she wasn’t in the guest room. Rio was curled around her, face buried against the back of her neck, under a heavy green comforter. It should have been too hot with their bodies so entwined, but it was the perfect kind of warm, the kind that makes you feel drowsy and safe.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone let out another chime.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t have cared less about who was emailing her, but she didn’t want it to wake up Rio. Easing away from her carefully, Agatha got out of bed and looked around for her phone. Without the warmth of Rio and the blanket though, it was cold, so she grabbed the first thing she found. Agatha slipped on Rio’s flannel. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It took some rifling, but Agatha found her pants and phone near the door. It was barely seven in the morning, and as Agatha tried to read her phone, she realized with a groan that she couldn’t see for shit. She cursed under her breath and slipped out of the room to grab her glasses. It should have felt stranger to walk around Rio’s cabin half-naked, but Agatha didn’t think much of it all.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Glasses perched on her nose, Agatha walked back into Rio’s room and eased the door shut behind her. She pulled up her email and started going through her recent messages. She stopped at the foot of the bed to do this, knowing she’d want to ignore it all once she was with Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was in the middle of answering an email to an executive when Rio’s voice, laden with sleep, murmured, “Mm, I could get used to waking up to this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Startled, Agatha locked her phone and looked up to find Rio looking at her through half-lidded eyes. Although just woken up, she could already see the hungry glint in her eye. Agatha looked down at herself and smirked. Open flannel and nothing else, messy hair, and glasses. Agatha had worn lingerie that cost hundreds of dollars before that hadn’t elicited this kind of response. “Is that so?” Agatha hummed. She tossed her phone onto the bedside table and crawled back onto the bed, settling herself on Rio’s hips.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you should work flannel into your wardrobe,” Rio replied, earnest even as her voice took on a huskier quality. Her hands skimmed the back of her thighs before sliding under the flannel to rest against her ass. Clearly, a favorite of hers. “And your glasses…” Rio bit her lip, and as she leaned closer, Agatha could see just how blown her pupils were. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Baby, you’re so easy,” Agatha teased, delighting in how the name made Rio flush. She leaned down to kiss her, only to squeak as Rio rolled them over. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha went to take off the flannel, but Rio stopped her. “Leave it on,” she said. She nudged Agatha’s glasses. “These too.” Agatha laughed, wanting to tease her about it, but she simply let her hands fall back onto the bed. Rio smirked and bent down to brush her lips against her ear. “Good girl.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>A sharp gasp left Agatha’s lips. She hadn’t expected Rio to remember her reaction to that. Rio pulled back just long enough to admire her blush before she kissed her hard, hand slipping between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>A few hours later, when they finally dragged themselves out of bed, Rio made them an indulgent breakfast. There were pancakes, eggs, bacon, and toast, far more than Agatha ever normally ate. Still wearing Rio’s flannel along with some sweatpants she borrowed, Agatha helped herself and sat across from Rio at the kitchen table. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Once again, Agatha was reminded of the domesticity of it all, especially as Rio read the news on her phone, hair held up messily by a clip and her own glasses on her face now too. A small part of her wanted to run. Just wanted to grab her clothes, ditch the flannel, abandon Rio, and run. Agatha didn’t do domesticity. She was never cut out for it. Or at least, that was what she always told herself when relationships inevitably ended.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, with Rio, Agatha wondered if she just hadn’t tried with the right people. Domesticity had only felt this right with Nicholas. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re staring,” Rio said. She raised a brow at her before she took a large bite of her pancakes. She got a bit of syrup on her face, and without thinking, Agatha wiped it away with her thumb and sucked it off. When she realized what she’d done, she froze, but Rio merely smiled her thanks and asked, “Want to talk about whatever’s on your mind?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just thinking,” Agatha replied. She looked down at her food, feeling the edges of panic at the thought of being vulnerable. Then, she looked up and saw Rio’s open expression, unexpectant and patient. Smiling slightly, Agatha said, “I used to bake cookies with Nicky, not just for Christmas but just whenever we wanted. He loved to help roll out the dough and cut out the shapes, and once they cooled, we’d decorate them together.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio covered Agatha’s hand with her own, squeezing it. “That sounds really nice,” she said softly. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I haven’t since, but,” Agatha stopped abruptly, biting her lip. It was still hard to say things, even when she wanted to.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully, Rio said it for her. “Would you like to bake something today? I should have everything we need to make cookies. Maybe not decorations though, but that’s easy enough to pick up from the store.” Rio brightened and added, “Oh, we could pick up popcorn while we’re at it to make strings of them. I still need to finish decorating, and popcorn strings are a requirement.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked around the cabin with a new eye. There was a small tree in the corner and some garland hanging, but beyond that, it was fairly plain. As someone who never decorated, Agatha hadn’t thought much of it. It would look wonderful with more decorations though. She couldn’t deny that. Like something out of a movie.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“That sounds nice,” Agatha said, and the wide grin she got in return soothed any lingering anxieties she had.</span>
</p><p>
<span>After breakfast and a quick trip to the only grocery store in town, Agatha found herself making cookie dough in Rio’s kitchen. The sleeves of her flannel were rolled up to her elbows, and her hair was pulled back into a haphazard ponytail. She was measuring the flour when Rio came up behind her and lightly jabbed her sides. Agatha yelped, jumping and sending flour everywhere.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, shit,” Rio laughed. She wrapped an arm around Agatha’s waist as she stood next to her. “I’m so sorry. I didn’t know you were that ticklish.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Huffing, Agatha threw a handful of flour in Rio’s face. Rio gamely took it, even if she sputtered a little. “I should dump this whole container on you,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Aw, do you want to match?” Rio teased. She kissed Agatha lightly before brushing some of the flour off of Agatha’s face. “If it helps, I think you look adorable like this.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not adorable,” Agatha argued.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you sure about that?” Rio replied. She pulled out her phone and held it out. Without giving Agatha a chance to prepare, she took a photo of them. Rio smiled as she pulled up the photo and showed her. Agatha’s face, flour dusting her hair, cheeks, and nose, was drawn into a petulant glare, not even facing the camera and instead looking at Rio. Meanwhile Rio beamed directly into the camera, a smile so large it took over her whole face. “Adorable,” Rio repeated fondly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Delete that,” Agatha said half-heartedly.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not a chance,” Rio replied without missing a beat. “So now what?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Since the dough needed to chill, they decided to dig up Rio’s decorations and put them up. To Agatha’s surprise, all of them were older or homemade, relics of Rio’s childhood. As they put them up, Rio regaled her with various stories of her growing up. The way she talked about her parents made Agatha both happy yet envious. Rio’s parents obviously loved her, taking care to make the holidays special for their family. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you do much growing up?” Rio asked a little while later. The two of them were sitting on the couch with a bowl of popcorn between them. While Rio threaded the popcorn with ease, Agatha found herself pricking her finger every other minute. Household skills had never been her strong suit. When Agatha didn’t answer immediately, Rio glanced at her and said, “You don’t have to share.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s not much to share,” Agatha admitted. She finally gave up and tossed her needle onto the coffee table, ignoring Rio’s amused smile. “My mother worked a lot when I was growing up, and when she wasn’t working, we didn’t do anything for Christmas anyways. It was a normal day.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What about with Nicky?” Rio asked, softer than her previous question. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath before she answered. “It was more like your childhood. I tried my best to do all of the usual stuff with him, cookies and presents and decorations. We did ice skating once before I decided I could do without him surrounded by shoes with blades on them.” This got a quiet laugh out of Rio, and Agath smiled at the sound and the memories. It’d been a long time since she let herself think about this. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Throughout the rest of the day, Agatha and Rio exchanged more stories about themselves, both about the holidays but also other times as well. Rio entertained Agatha with the hijinks that the town of Westview got up to, and more than once, Agatha wondered the validity of her stories. There was no way this town was that weird. Then again, maybe it was. Meanwhile, Agatha spoke occasionally about raising Nicky, small bits and pieces that she felt steady enough to share like when Nicky’s first steps or his obsession with giraffes when he was four. </span>
</p><p>
<span>By the time they were curled up on the couch that night, a plate of cookies beside them and a Christmas movie playing on the TV, Agatha felt more unburdened than she had in years. She couldn’t remember the last time she felt this free with no expectations or stress. Agatha was half-awake in Rio’s arms, head resting against her chest, as Rio gave her running commentary on the movie. As she spoke, Rio would absently run her hand through Agatha’s hand, and each stroke lulled Agatha closer to sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was more or less asleep when her phone rang. She grumbled as Rio stretched out to grab her, disrupting her comfortable position. It was her phone though, so Agatha sat up and rubbed her eyes. With a sigh and a scrunch of her nose, she took her phone from Rio and answered it with a gravelly, annoyed, “Hello?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The laughing voice of one of the board member’s greeted her. Jack said, </span>
<em>
<span>“Don’t tell me you were already asleep. It’s barely eight, Harkness.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m on vacation, aren’t I?” Agatha replied. “The vacation you made me take.”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Only you would be upset about taking a few days off,” </span>
</em>
<span>Jack said. </span>
<em>
<span>“But that’s why I’m calling. We didn’t exactly set a day for your return. When are you coming back to the office?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>“When I’m coming back,” Agatha repeated. She felt Rio tense against her. She pressed her lips together, forced to remember the reality of the situation. She didn’t live here in Westview. She didn’t want to either. Eventually, Agatha would have to leave this town and Rio with it. “I’m waiting on my rental to get fixed, so it may be a few more days,” Agatha lied. “Can I get back to you tomorrow after I talk to the auto shop?”</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Sure, sure. Just let us know ASAP.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<span>Thankfully, Jack didn’t care enough to ask about the holidays or exchange pleasantries, so he hung up right after that. Agatha dropped her phone into her lap and stole a glance at Rio, who was staring off into space. Hesitantly, she reached out and cupped her cheek. Rio blinked a few times, but then she leaned into the touch and smiled at her.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Everything okay?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mm, just making plans,” Agatha said. “Nothing’s set.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded slowly. She turned her head and kissed Agatha’s palm before she rested her cheek against it once more. “You don’t have to, but will you stay until the day before Christmas Eve? We always have a bonfire, and you’ll probably hate all of the singing and talking, but it’s really beautiful.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>That was just a few more days. Agatha could do that. She could gift that to herself. A few more days of ignorant bliss before she had to say good-bye to it all. “I’ll stay,” Agatha said. She leaned forward and kissed Rio tenderly. “If you’ll have me.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flashed with something that made Agatha’s breath catch. She wrapped her arms around her and buried her face in her neck. “Of course,” was all Rio said though. </span>
</p><p>
<span>That night, when they fell into bed, Rio’s touch was soft and reverent, her kisses gentle and loving. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried not to think too much about how it felt like the beginning of a good-bye.</span>

<p>Over the next few days, Agatha caught a glimpse of another life. It wasn’t one she would want for the long-term, but for now, it was nice.</p><p>Agatha slept in every morning, only getting up once Rio was already gone. A little more comfortable around the cabin now, Agatha would make herself breakfast, cereal or eggs, then get ready for the day.</p><p>Because Westview was, well, Westview, there really wasn’t much to do, so Agatha had taken to grabbing random books off Rio’s shelves and taking them with her to read at Lilia’s. It’d been so long since Agatha had any kind of leisure time, and it should have been so relaxing to read in a cafe. In reality, Agatha read for maybe an hour before she went to bother Lilia at the counter. Some days, Lilia would give her some menial tasks like pouring salt and pepper into shakers, wordlessly recognizing Agatha’s need to do something.</p><p>While Agatha would do this, she would sit at the counter and talk to Lilia. Just as Agatha suspected, Lilia was a woman of quick wit and no patience for bullshit. It was also never explicitly said, but the two women seemed to share an understanding that they’d suffered losses in their lives, and that seemed to color their conversations about their pasts. </p><p>It was nice to have someone who seemed to understand that part of her, and when Agatha wasn’t in the mood for such easy talk, she’d inevitably search out Jennifer. Sometimes, it would be at her store, and other times it would be at the auto shop when she was visiting Alice. Regardless of location though, Agatha would find a way to piss Jennifer off. It was far too easy, the way Jennifer took every bait and taunt, but it livened up Agatha’s day to argue with someone.</p><p>“This is what’s trending,” Jennifer would insist. </p><p>With a completely straight face, Agatha replied, “Yeah, maybe with the teens.” To which Jennifer would glare at her and kick her out. </p><p>This entertained Agatha until school released for the day and Billy inevitably came to find her. </p><p>More than once, Agatha had probed the kid about not having friends, but Billy would shrug. Apparently there was a boy named Eddie, but that had Billy clamming up faster than Agatha could blink. Between that and the identity crisis, Agatha humored him about giving her tours around Westview, as if anyone would need help navigating the small town.</p><p>There were worse ways to pass the time though, and in the evenings, Agatha went back to the cabin with Rio. Before dinner, the two of them would walk in the woods, hand-in-hand now. Rio had all sorts of stories about climbing trees as a child, myths her parents told her, and games she’d play with. Every so often, Agatha would share a little bit of her childhood too. They were rarely as happy of memories as Rio’s, but Rio would always squeeze her hand and let her speak. </p><p>Afterwards, they would have dinner and curl up in bed or on the couch, watching or reading whatever caught their interest. </p><p>The sex wasn’t bad either. Not that Agatha would ever tell Rio, lest it get to her head, but it was probably the best Agatha’s ever had. </p><p>If Agatha had thought things felt domestic before, they reached new bounds over the following days. Right down to stealing all of Rio’s flannels because they were so comfortable and warm. </p><p>That was what Agatha was wearing tonight as they went to the bonfire on Christmas Eve. Jeans, a blue plaid flannel, and one of Rio’s more casual coats. People in New York would have never recognized her like this. Agatha wasn’t sure if she minded. </p><p>“So what is this thing exactly?” Agatha asked as Rio drove them into town. </p><p>“A bonfire.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She swatted Rio’s arms and watched her grin. “Okay, and that’s it? Just lighting some shit on fire?”</p><p>“There’s cocoa and carols. Mainly it’s just pretty.”</p><p>“Are you secretly a pyromaniac?”</p><p>Rio laughed, “No more than anyone else in this town.”</p><p>“Because that’s reassuring,” Agatha drawled. </p><p>Just as they did for the winter festival, they parked at the clinic and walked to the main part of town. People were milling about, and most of them greeted Rio happily. To Agatha’s surprise, a few of them greeted her as well. </p><p>“I always knew you were a romantic, Rio,” Jennifer said when they ran into them. She was dressed in a tailored, pink coat with her arm looped through Alice’s. Her style proved a stark contrast to Alice’s worn leather jacket, yet they still seemed to compliment each other. “You’ve just been waiting to bring someone to this thing, haven’t you?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and addressed Alice, “Don’t let her near the spiked cocoa.”</p><p>“Too late,” Alice smirked. She tugged on Jennifer’s arm though and nodded to them. “Have a good night.”</p><p>Rio echoed the sentiment and similarly pulled Agatha along by her hand. </p><p>“Spiked cocoa?” Agatha asked curiously. </p><p>“Of course that caught your attention,” Rio said with fond exasperation. “Come on.”</p><p>It turned out some alcohol did wonders to improve Agatha’s openness towards this whole thing, and when they finally got around to lighting the bonfire, Agatha was tipsy and warm with her hand tucked into the crook of Rio’s arm. The fire blazed to life, flickering high and setting an orange glow against the Christmas decorations that filled the town square. </p><p>“Pretty, huh?” Rio said, noticing her stare. </p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha lied, but Rio’s knowing grin told her she wasn’t very convincing. </p><p>They stood there for a while, enjoying the bonfire and even the slightly off-key carols, until Rio perked up and said, “Oh, I have something for you.” She dug her hand into the pocket of her jeans and held something out to her. “Here, for you.”</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha wasn’t even staring at her hand. Instead, she looked at Rio’s eyes, frowning. She hadn’t thought they’d exchange gifts or else she would’ve gotten her something. </p><p>“It’s nothing much, okay?” Rio said with a shrug. “It’s not a big deal.” She wiggled her fingers, drawing Agatha’s attention to what laid in her palm. It was a wooden wolf, maybe two inches big. Hand-carved by the looks of it. “It’s just a hobby of mine, and I was bored at work. Anyways, you act like such a lone wolf that I thought… I don’t know. It’s like one of three things I know how to carve and I figured you wouldn’t like a bear or deer.” Rio started talking faster and faster, her words a rush by the end. Her cheeks were also red, a darker flush than what the cold had brought on. </p><p>Carefully, Agatha picked it up and ran her fingers over the smooth wood. It was the kind of thing Agatha would have never thought she wanted, a stupid trinket that didn’t fit her aesthetic at all. In a store, Agatha wouldn’t have given it a second glance. </p><p>But Rio made this for her. Thought of her and carved it for her with her own hands. </p><p>Agatha couldn’t remember the last time she’d received such a thoughtful gift. </p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said quietly. She slipped it into her pocket and pressed a kiss to Rio’s cheek. </p><p>Rio’s smile was shy yet blinding. “You’re welcome.” </p><p>It was a perfect night, but Agatha couldn’t help but think about the elephant in the room. The fact that tonight was supposed to be her last night here. They hadn’t talked about it. Not once. As Rio drove them back to the cabin later, Agatha wondered if she would bring it up at all, or when it came for her to leave, she’d just wave good-bye like this meant nothing.</p><p>“Are we going to talk about it?” Agatha asked, patience finally wearing thin as Rio pulled into her driveway. </p><p>Rio paused, hand still on the key in the ignition. She slowly turned to look at Agatha, eyebrows furrowed. She opened her mouth then closed it. She tried again. “Talk about what?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and got out of the car. </p><p>“Hey! Wait! Talk about what?”</p><p>Agatha tried not to think too hard about the fact that she knew Rio hid her spare key under the ugliest squirrel statue seen to man. She just let herself into the cabin and tried to slam the door shut behind her. A failed attempt though, seeing as Rio caught it and followed after her.</p><p>“Hey, don’t do that,” Rio said, catching her wrist. With a firm pull, she forced Agatha to stop and face her. “Talk to me. What do you want to talk about?”</p><p>“Why don’t you want me to stay?” Agatha blurted out. “In Westview. Why don’t you want me to stay with you?”</p><p>Rio looked like she’d been hit upside the head. “What makes you think I don’t want you to stay?” Rio asked incredulously.</p><p>“You never asked,” Agatha said, feeling like this should be obvious.</p><p>“Agatha, come on,” Rio laughed, but it was a strangled, confused sound. “We’ve known each other for a week. I’m not going to ask or expect you to just pack up your life for me.” She ran a hand through her hair and added, “Besides, I think we both know you’d lose your mind in this town.”</p><p>All perfectly reasonable points, but Agatha wasn’t feeling especially reasonable at the moment. All she could feel was the tightening in her chest that she made this all up somehow. That this was just some stupid fantasy of hers. She didn’t want this to be some fluke or some accident. She wanted this to be real, and she hadn’t realized just how badly she wanted that until she felt it slipping away from her.</p><p>So, instead of saying something calm and understanding, Agatha snapped, “It still would have been nice if you asked!”</p><p>“And what would you have said?” Rio’s voice had lost any trace of humor, settling into barely restrained anger. “If I asked you to stay, what would you have said? Would you have laughed? Told me you’re never leaving New York?” Rio shook her head, anger melting into sadness, and Agatha desperately wished she’d return to her previous fury. “I know this town isn’t enough for you, Agatha,” Rio said. “I know I’m not enough.”</p><p>Agatha’s reflex was to deny this. Rio was enough. Rio, who was smart and funny and sharp, was enough. It wasn’t just Rio though. It was this town, one Rio would never leave while they still needed her. While the people who made her who she was still lived here. And just like Rio said, this town wasn’t enough for her.</p><p>“Agatha, this isn’t about me and whether or not I asked you to stay,” Rio said, voice softening as if to gentle the blow. As if Agatha wasn’t mid-crisis. Her hand dropped from her wrist to hold her hand. “This is about you not knowing what you want. If you’re unhappy with your life, that’s fine. Quit your job. Move out of New York. Change whatever you want. But don’t pin that on me.”</p><p>Rio kissed her, a light press of their lips, and Agatha let out a shaky breath as Rio rested her forehead against hers. “I’m sorry,” Agatha whispered, and she wished Rio understood just how important it was that she say that. She didn’t apologize to just anyone.</p><p>“I know,” Rio said. She kissed Agatha’s forehead and gave her a small smile. “And I forgive you, but I think you should sleep in the guest room tonight. I think we both need some space.”</p><p>The last thing Agatha wanted was to spend any more time away from her, but she nodded. She had a lot to think about. Agatha stole one more kiss from Rio before she walked away, reeling with the possibilities in front of her.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio was gone when Agatha woke up.</p><p>That wasn’t anything new, but Agatha couldn’t help but feel the cabin felt even emptier than it had before. </p><p>Laying in bed, Agatha stared up at the ceiling, pensive as soon as her eyes opened.</p><p>Last night’s fight felt seared into her mind, and Agatha couldn’t help but replay it again and again. Maybe she would come to a decision, if she thought about it enough. There had to be an easier answer than choosing New York or Rio. Was it really all or nothing?</p><p>Rubbing her temples, Agatha tried to imagine driving out here to see Rio. The thought of willingly returning to this small town made her head hurt. Still, wouldn’t it be worth it to see her? Agatha wouldn’t make the drive for just anyone. Rio was unlike anyone Agatha had met in years, simultaneously clever and warm, smart and kind. Nothing like the people Agatha usually associated with in New York but in all the right ways. How long would she be able to do that though, all that driving?</p><p>With a sigh, Agatha dragged herself out of bed. Instead of going for Rio’s flannels like she had the last few days, Agatha put on her own slacks and sweater. Out in the kitchen, as Rio had taken to doing, there was a note. The last few days, the notes consisted of simple hellos and stupid jokes. Today was different. It was a single sentence.</p><p align="center">
<em> Agatha, please don’t leave without saying good-bye.  </em>
</p><p>Agatha sighed and pocketed the note to put with all the others she’d tucked away in her back. A moment later, her phone rang and she answered without a second thought. That was how she found herself on the phone for the next two hours, putting out fires that had come up during her absence.</p><p>Part of her wished she’d hated it. Things would be so much easier if Agatha realized she hated her corporate job and all of the stress that went with it. In truth though, Agatha loved it. During those two hours, Agatha felt the satisfaction that came with being competent and directing others, in knowing exactly how to fix things. Agatha thrived on the high-stress and fix-its of her job. It wasn’t something she could let go, and it wasn’t the kind of job that could be remote.</p><p>Without it, Agatha would grow bored and lose her mind quickly. Another reason she could never stay in Westview. </p><p>Agatha could feel herself creating a mental list of positives and negatives as she made her way to Lilia’s, but the process stopped abruptly when she saw Billy there. The teenager looked like he was ruminating. Agatha could understand that.</p><p>After ordering a coffee and pastry, Agatha slid into the seat across from him, just as he had always done to her.</p><p>Instead of the goofy smile she normally got, Billy merely stared at her solemnly.</p><p>“Who died?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Billy rolled his eyes, but he didn’t answer. That was fine. Agatha could roll her eyes and be silent too. She could wait out a kid. And she did. In the time it took for her to finish her food and drink, they sat in silence until Billy finally said, “I’m meeting my birth parents on new years.” The delivery was as if he’d just announced his execution.</p><p>“Nervous?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“A little,” Billy said before he scrunched up his face. “Okay, a lot. I just don’t know what to do.”</p><p>“Well, what do you want out of this meeting?” Agatha said with a shrug. “Answers? A relationship?”</p><p>Billy hesitated, as if never considering it before. God, did this kid really not have anyone else to talk to? After a moment, Billy said, “Both, I guess. Is that bad? To want to get to know them when I still have my parents?” He chewed on his lip. “Am I allowed to have both?”</p><p>Agatha wanted to laugh. Wasn’t that the question for everyone these days? Was it possible to have both? Billy didn’t need to know everything that was happening between her and Rio though, so Agatha merely said, “You can try.”</p><p>“But what if it goes wrong?” Billy asked. “What if I hurt them? Or if they hurt me? What if it doesn’t work out?”</p><p>Agatha considered this, tapping her finger against her mug. She understood the fear a little too well. No one wanted to get hurt. Agatha looked at this boy, so young with so much ahead of him. He was too young for regrets. Agatha imagined what she’d want someone to say to Nicholas.</p><p>“Well, it very well may go wrong, but at least you’d know,” Agatha said, quiet yet firm. “You won’t have to ask yourself what could’ve been.”</p><p>And that’s what it came down to, wasn’t it? For both Billy and Agatha. It was ridiculous that it took talking to a teenaged boy to get to this conclusion. Agatha was certainly never admitting any of that to anyone. If it somehow came up, she’d say she just got there by herself.</p><p>After talking for a little longer, Agatha excused herself. She had a lot she needed to do now.</p><p>First, Agatha went to find Rio a gift. The small wolf sat in her pocket, and Agatha found herself reaching for it periodically. While Agatha wasn’t exactly crafty, she could still find a decent gift. She already had an idea anyway, and it took less than an hour for her to find what she wanted in the jewelry store. It was a simple silver necklace with a black diamond pendant. Classic yet beautiful. It would be perfect for Rio.</p><p>With the gift secured, Agatha went back to the cabin and spent the next few hours working. Emails, a lot of emails, needed to be answered. Besides the basic answers and directions she needed to give, she also needed to move meetings and delegate more tasks if she wanted to stay past Christmas. </p><p>Maybe it was because she had a goal in mind, or maybe it was because of her break from work, but Agatha worked swiftly and efficiently for nearly four hours straight in order to complete everything she needed done. She had just finished sending off her last email when she heard Rio come in.</p><p>Despite herself, Agatha tensed. Although she came to her decision and planned for this moment all day, it was still more frightening than she wanted to admit to actually do it now. Taking a deep breath, Agatha stepped out into the main area. Rio had her back to her, unpacking groceries. Agatha hesitated, unsure of how to greet her, before she quietly walked up behind her.</p><p>Rio jumped when Agatha wrapped her arms around her waist, but after a moment, she relaxed into her. Agatha rested her chin on Rio’s shoulder, turning her face to press it against her neck. They stayed like that for a few seconds before Agatha let go and moved to help Rio.</p><p>“I didn’t expect you to stay this late,” Rio said after a moment. “The sun is going to set soon. Are you sure you want to drive when it’s dark?”</p><p>Agatha paused, can of pumpkin in hand. Not exactly the segue she wanted, but it would have to do. She set down the food and faced Rio fully. “I’m not going back tonight,” Agatha said.</p><p>Hopefulness and fear battled across Rio’s face as she turned toward her. “What are you saying, Agatha?”</p><p>“I’m saying I want to try,” Agatha said, and she hated the way her voice wavered. She reached out, but her nerves kept her from grabbing Rio’s hands. Instead, Agatha hooked her fingers through the loops of Rio’s jeans. Taking a deep breath, Agatha said everything that had been tumbling around in her head all day. “The drive isn’t that long, and phones exist, and you could visit me sometimes, and I can still come here, and I just don’t want to spend the rest of my life wondering what could’ve been if I’d just given us a chance. I don’t know why it had to be you in this stupid town, but you’re what I want, Rio.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer at first, and Agatha felt her breath catch. She didn’t want her. She didn’t want to try. She didn’t–</p><p>Agatha gasped as Rio suddenly grabbed her face and crashed her lips into hers. It was a clumsy kiss, but it was earnest. Agatha felt Rio smile into the kiss as she hugged her closer.</p><p>“God, you scare me,” Rio breathed as she pulled away. “I spent all day thinking I’d come back to an empty home, and I hated it. I hated the idea that I may never see you again.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha’s voice was small and vulnerable.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said shamelessly. She smiled though, wide and happy, and Agatha found herself returning it. “So, you’re staying?”</p><p>“Until the thirtieth,” Agatha said. </p><p>Rio’s face was akin to the sun with how bright it was, and a moment later, she swooped Agatha into another hug, spinning her around. Agatha shrieked before she burst into giddy laughter. It was stupid. It was so stupid and cheesy, but her heart felt like it might burst with how happy she was. </p><p>“This is going to work,” Rio said as she set her back down. She rested her forehead against hers, her smile smaller but no less radiant. Her words came out like a promise. “We’re going to make it work.”</p><p>“Careful,” Agatha said softly. “A girl could get used to this.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said. She kissed her again and winked. “Because you’re stuck with me now.”</p><p>”Merry Christmas,” Agatha said. </p><p>Rio smirked and corrected her, “Merry Christmas Eve.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and just pulled her into another kiss. </p>

<strong> <em>One year later.</em> </strong>
</p><p> </p><p>“It’s freezing,” Agatha complained.</p><p>“It’s winter,” Rio replied, unfazed. She hugged Agatha from behind, and despite the several layers both of them were wearing, Agatha swore she could still feel the warmth coming from her. She leaned further back into her, only to huff when Rio pressed her cold nose to the crook of her neck.</p><p>“It wasn’t this cold last year.”</p><p>“Aw, but isn’t the snow so pretty?”</p><p>In front of them, the bonfire lit up Westview’s town square with bright, growing flames. They each had their cup of spiked hot cocoa, and they stood among the other townspeople to enjoy the sight.</p><p>The last year hadn’t been easy for them by any means, but Agatha could confidently say she was the happiest she’d ever been.</p><p>Not long after she returned to New York, Agatha became overwhelmed at work. There was always something to do, and once one problem was solved, ten more seemed to pop up. Although there were texts and the occasional call, conversation between Agatha and Rio had dwindled.</p><p>It wasn’t until Jennifer had called Agatha, threatening bodily harm on her, that Agatha realized just how bad it’d gotten. After sending Jennifer a nice bottle of wine, Agatha organized her work in order to go to Westview that weekend. </p><p>Agatha could still remember Rio’s face when she opened her door and found her standing there, overnight bag on her shoulder.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Rio asked. She reached out and poked Agatha in the shoulder. Then, she poked her again. And again. When she went to do it for the fourth time, Agatha batted her hand away. “Sorry, sorry,” Rio laughed, sounding a little dazed. “I just can’t believe you’re here.”</p><p>“And that’s how you decide to greet me?” Agatha replied.</p><p>Rio smirked. She pulled Agatha inside and pressed her against the door, kissing her deeply. Agatha moaned and pulled her closer, sliding her hands into the back pockets of her jeans and wedging a thigh between her legs. </p><p>“I have another surprise for you,” Agatha murmured against her lips.</p><p>“A puppy?” Rio teased. It’d been a point of conversation the last few weeks. Rio wanted to get a dog, but Agatha had been adamantly pointing out the realities of having one, such as what she would even do with one when she was visiting Agatha in New York. Rio was still stubbornly championing for one.</p><p>“Ha, no,” Agatha said. She pushed Rio off of her and toyed with the bottom of her shirt. “You’ll have to unwrap me to find out.”</p><p>Realization dawned on Rio quickly, and Agatha’s laugh echoed through the cabin as Rio eagerly dragged her back to the bedroom. </p><p>That was only the beginning for them, and other difficulties included Rio visiting Agatha in New York for the first time. </p><p>Needless to say, small town and grounded Dr. Rio Vidal had been more than a little perturbed by the grandeur and luxury of Agatha’s life in the city. More than once, she tried to steer Agatha toward cheaper, simpler options whether it be for a meal or an activity for them to do. It ended with a huge fight between them about money, and Rio leaving a day early.</p><p>Rio came back the following weekend though, and while she still couldn’t quite wrap her head around Agatha’s lifestyle, she accepted it. That still didn’t stop her from persuading Agatha to eat at more of the hole-in-the-wall restaurants in the city.</p><p>Now, a year later, Agatha and Rio had finally settled into a routine and rhythm, full of calls and visits whenever they could.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio whispered into her ear.</p><p>Agatha blushed and kissed her cheek quickly. “I love you too.”</p><p>“Get a room!”</p><p>Agatha’s blush darkened as Jennifer and Alice walked up to them, holding hands. Really, they didn’t have much room to talk. They were wearing matching sweaters. Agatha pointed this out to them, and Alice just shrugged and said, “Okay, so we all need to get a room.”</p><p>“Not me!”</p><p>Billy jogged up to them rosy-cheeked and beaming. Besides Rio, the kid ended up being the person Agatha spoke to the most from Westview. He got her number from Rio and decided himself that Agatha would now be his go-to person for advice. Agatha though it was annoying. Rio thought it was adorable.</p><p>“Where’s your boyfriend?” Agatha replied.</p><p>Billy reddened and said, “He’s not my boyfriend!”</p><p>“Oh, but she didn’t say a name, so how do you know who she's talking about?” Rio said, grinning. This made everyone else laugh, and Billy huffed, claiming that Rio was the worst. “Oh, absolutely,” she agreed. She huffed Agatha tighter and laughed. “I’m very happily on the naughty list this year.”</p><p>“Gross,” Billy groaned, but he was smiling.</p><p>“Get out of here,” Agatha told him.</p><p>“You get out of here,” Billy shot back.</p><p>Agatha smirked, “Fine, we will.” She grabbed Rio’s hand and started to drag her toward the car. Jennifer, Alice, and Billy booed them as they left, but Rio merely flipped them off. As they walked away, Agatha waved to Lilia who winked back.</p><p>“I’m glad we left now,” Rio said as they got to the car. She pressed Agatha against the side of it and kissed her. She slipped her hands under Agatha's jackets, and Agatha gasped, arching away from the cold touch. “Plenty of time for your gift.”</p><p>“Time?” Agatha repeated.</p><p>“Let’s just say I decided to repay you for what you got me your first weekend back,” Rio hummed.</p><p>Agatha grinned as she remembered their long night with lace and silk. “Merry Christmas to me.”</p>
