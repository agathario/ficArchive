A confident, grounded doctor with a quiet warmth and an easy smile, Rio didn’t just turn Agatha’s head—she challenged everything Agatha thought she knew about herself.</p><p>In a single evening, Agatha felt the walls she’d so carefully built begin to crack.

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha sighed deeply, her gaze sweeping over the controlled chaos of her living room.</p><p>Toys were scattered across the plush forest green rug, remnants of a morning spent keeping her daughter entertained while trying to tick off an endless to-do list. She could hear the thudding of little feet upstairs—her five-year-old son, Nicholas, was racing around in his underwear, giggling to himself as if it were the best game in the world.</p><p>“Nicholas,” she called, exasperation creeping into her voice, “please, for the love of all things festive, get dressed! We need to leave soon.”</p><p>A high-pitched, “I’m Spider-Man!” echoed back, accompanied by the sound of him leaping onto his bed.</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose and sighed again. She loved her children fiercely. They were her world, her joy, her purpose. But that didn’t mean motherhood wasn’t hard—relentlessly, bone-deep hard. Days like this reminded her just how thin she was sometimes stretched, balancing the delicate, precarious dance of being a single mother by choice, while running a company that demanded her sharp intellect and relentless energy.</p><p>Her consulting firm wasn’t just successful—it was one of the elite. Harkness Consulting was a name whispered in the halls of Fortune 500 companies and political offices alike. CEOs and dignitaries paid her exorbitant fees for her and her teams expertise and she delivered results every time. Her wealth was the envy of many, her tailored suits a symbol of her power and precision, her confidence unshakable in the boardroom. But no amount of success could make up for the exhaustion she felt in moments like these, wrangling her children alone in a house that felt far too large and quiet after they were tucked into bed.</p><p>Agatha glanced down at Storey, her eleven-month-old daughter, who was perched on a playmat surrounded by stuffed animals. Storey was currently gnawing on a plush rabbit, her bright blue eyes—a very similar shade to her mother’s—darting around the room as she babbled happily to herself.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile at her daughter’s innocence, even as she reached down to adjust the baby’s festive red dress for the hundredth time that day.</p><p>“Alright, missy,” Agatha murmured, brushing a stray wisp of dark hair from Storey’s face. “You’re ready, at least. That’s one of us.”</p><p>She rose to her feet and glanced at the clock. They were supposed to be at Wanda holiday party in less than an hour, and she hadn’t even started getting herself ready. A glance at the large floor length mirror by the door confirmed her suspicions—her usually polished appearance was nowhere to be found. Her dark hair, normally sleek and styled, was tied in a messy curly ponytail, and she was still wearing an old Yale sweatshirt and black leggings stained with carrots from lunchtime.</p><p>“Perfect,” she muttered sarcastically.</p><p>She padded into the open plan kitchen, grabbing a sip of now-cold coffee from a mug she’d abandoned earlier, her mind racing through the rest of the evening’s logistics.</p><p>Wanda’s parties were always fun for the kids. Nicholas adored playing with Wanda’s twin boys, Billy and Tommy, and Agatha couldn’t deny that she enjoyed seeing Wanda, one of the few people who truly understood how much she juggled every day. Still, there was a nagging feeling at the back of her mind—an ache she’d tried to ignore for years.</p><p>She was alone.</p><p>Yes, she had Nicholas and Storey, and they were her everything. Yes, she had a career that gave her financial independence and the respect of her peers. But there were moments—quiet moments, when the children were asleep and the house was still—when the loneliness crept in like a shadow. She secretly wished she had someone to share the load, someone to laugh with, to lean on, to love. Nicholas had been just a few months old when she adopted him, and Storey had been nothing more than a few hours old when she joined their family.  She didn’t have energy or time to date, which left her with beautiful children but no partnership to speak of.</p><p>Agatha rarely let herself dwell on it. There was no time for self-pity when there were diapers to change, clients to charm, and PTA meetings to attend. But tonight, as she wrangled her children in preparation for the party, the weight of it all felt heavier than usual.</p><p>“Nicholas!” she called again, making her way up the stairs with Storey on her hip to find him. She entered his room to see him standing on his bed, his underwear on his head like a hat, pretending to swing from invisible webs. Despite her frustration, she couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“Spider-Man, huh?” she said, crossing her arms and leaning against the doorframe.</p><p>Nicholas grinned, his dimples flashing. “I’m saving the city!”</p><p>“Well, the city’s going to have to wait because we need to get to Auntie Wanda’s party. Come on, bud. Let’s get dressed.”</p><p>After much coaxing and a promise that he could wear his favourite Christmas sweater, Nicholas was finally dressed and ready, bounding down the stairs with uncontainable excitement. Agatha, meanwhile, managed to pull herself together in record time, slipping into a chic black tailored suit accented with a festive red scarf. She swiped on some lipstick, brushed her hair into a more styled pony tail, and grabbed the diaper bag and presents waiting by the door.</p><p>By the time they piled into the car, Agatha felt like she’d run a marathon—and the night hadn’t even begun.</p><p>As they pulled away from the house and through the electric gates, Nicholas chattered excitedly about all the fun he was going to have with Billy and Tommy, while Storey babbled happily in her car seat.</p><p>Agatha glanced at them in the rearview mirror, her heart swelling with love despite her exhaustion.</p><p>Yes, it was hard. Yes, she was tired. But as Agatha drove toward Wanda’s house, her children’s laughter ringing out like music in the car, she reminded herself that it was all worth it. The sacrifices, the late nights, the perpetual exhaustion—none of it mattered when she saw Nicholas’s infectious grin or heard Storey’s delighted babbles. She wouldn’t trade her life for anything.</p><p>Wanda’s holiday party was a long-standing tradition, one that Agatha always made time for despite her packed schedule. Wanda Maximoff wasn’t just her best friend—she was her anchor, a rare constant in Agatha’s whirlwind life. They had met years ago, back when they were both students. Agatha had been a driven, no-nonsense business student, laser-focused on climbing the corporate ladder, while Wanda had been a quiet yet fiercely intelligent medical student with a heart of gold.</p><p>Their friendship had started on a whim—a shared table in a crowded campus café—but it had deepened quickly. Wanda had a way of seeing through Agatha’s carefully constructed walls, of gently pulling her out of her own head. Even now, years later, Wanda was still the person Agatha could turn to when the weight of her responsibilities became too much to bear.</p><p>As Agatha turned onto Wanda’s snow-dusted street, she couldn’t help but smile at the sight of her friend’s house glowing warmly in the distance. Wanda had outdone herself, as always; the front yard was festooned with twinkling lights, and a large wreath adorned the front door. A line of cars was already parked along the curb, and Agatha spotted a few familiar vehicles belonging to the other parents she knew through the twins’ school and sports teams.<br/>Nicholas pressed his face to the car window, bouncing in his booster seat.</p><p>“Is Billy there? Do you think Tommy’s waiting for me?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled as she pulled into the driveway.</p><p>“I’m sure they’re just as excited to see you as you are to see them. But first, coats on, okay? It’s freezing out there.”</p><p>Once she’d parked and bundled up both children, Agatha carried Storey on her hip while Nicholas darted ahead, his excitement impossible to contain. She followed him up the front steps, shifting the diaper bag on her shoulder as she rang the doorbell.</p><p>The door swung open almost immediately, and there was Wanda, looking effortlessly radiant in a deep scarlett sweater dress. Her warm smile widened when she saw Agatha.</p><p>“You made it! The kids have been asking about Nicholas all week.” Wanda exclaimed, pulling her into a hug. “Nicholas, Storey—it’s so good to see you!”</p><p>Nicholas rushed past her with a quick, “Hi, Auntie Wanda!” and disappeared into the living room, where the sound of children’s laughter and upbeat holiday music spilled out.</p><p>Agatha laughed, stepping inside as Wanda helped her with the diaper bag. ““He’s been counting down to this party like it’s the Oscars. Thank you for having us, as always.”</p><p>“Are you kidding? I wouldn’t dream of doing this without you.” Wanda took Storey from Agatha’s arms, cooing at the baby. “And hello to you, little miss! Look at you—you’re growing so fast.”</p><p>As they moved into the house, Agatha took in the familiar sight of Wanda’s and Visions warm, bustling home. The living room was filled with parents chatting in clusters, children darting around the Christmas tree in a wild game of tag. Wanda’s twin boys, a year older than Nicholas, Billy and Tommy, were at the center of the action, their faces lighting up when they spotted Nicholas joining in.</p><p>Agatha recognized a few of the other mums and dads from events and playdates—a mix of friendly faces who waved her over as she settled Storey in a cozy spot on the rug near the play area. But there were also plenty of unfamiliar faces—likely Wanda’s colleagues from the hospital, judging by the snatches of conversation about patient rounds and upcoming shifts.</p><p>“Some of the other doctors came,” Wanda said softly, as if reading Agatha’s mind. She handed her a glass of mulled wine, a knowing smile on her face. “I thought it’d be nice to mix things up this year. Plus, you never know—maybe you’ll meet someone interesting.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a pointed look. “Wanda…”</p><p>“What?” Wanda asked innocently, though the mischievous glint in her eyes betrayed her. “You deserve a little fun, Agatha. You’re always working or chasing after the kids. Let someone chase after you for a change.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though she couldn’t entirely hide her smirk. “We’ll see.”</p><p>As the evening unfolded, Agatha found herself moving seamlessly between conversations with the other parents and polite introductions to Wanda’s colleagues. The other mums were warm and welcoming as always, swapping stories about their kids’ latest antics and exchanging recommendations for winter activities. But it was one of the strangers—a striking woman with dark eyes and an easy smile—who caught Agatha’s attention.</p><p>She first noticed her standing near the far wall, watching the chaos of the children’s games with an amused expression. There was something about her—an air of quiet confidence, the kind that didn’t demand attention but effortlessly commanded it.</p><p>Agatha found herself stealing glances at her as she juggled conversations and kept an eye on her children.</p><p>Unaware, at first, that she was also being equally observed, Agatha found herself caught up in the whirlwind of the party, drawn from one conversation to the next by Wanda’s circle of friends. But the subtle prickle of awareness eventually caught her attention.</p><p>Agatha was no stranger to the feeling of being watched—whether it came from boardroom stares or passing admiration. Her eyes flicked across the room, sharp and calculating as always, until she spotted her observer.</p><p>By the refreshment table, the same striking woman stood, holding a glass of mulled wine. Her dark, intelligent eyes followed Agatha’s movements with an unmistakable spark of curiosity. The woman wasn’t part of Wanda’s usual crowd, Agatha was sure of it. Her poised stance and the thoughtful way she sipped her drink suggested a quiet confidence, and the faint smile playing at her lips hinted at an interest that Agatha couldn’t ignore.</p><p>As if sensing the scrutiny, the woman’s gaze met Agatha’s. For a heartbeat, the air seemed to thrum between them, an almost electric pull that caught Agatha off guard. The intensity of it was subtle yet undeniable, and for a moment, Agatha felt rooted to the spot, unable to look away.</p><p>The woman’s eyes—dark and thoughtful, with a hint of something playful—held hers just long enough to make Agatha’s pulse quicken. Then, as quickly as it had begun, the moment broke. The woman looked away, her lashes dipping as a faint flush crept up her cheeks.</p><p>“Interesting,” Agatha murmured to herself, a small smirk tugging at her lips.</p><p>She sipped her wine, letting the warm spices of the drink linger on her tongue as her mind raced. Who was she? A friend of Wanda’s? A colleague? The effortless grace with which she carried herself hinted at intelligence and self-assurance, yet there was a softness to her that intrigued Agatha—a quiet vulnerability that made her want to learn more.</p><p>Her gaze lingered for a moment longer, taking in the woman’s relaxed posture as she stood listening to a man that had engaged her in conversation, her fingers lightly cradling a glass of mulled wine. She seemed comfortable in the lively chaos of the party, observing it all with a calm detachment. But Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that beneath her composed exterior, there was more—something unspoken, waiting to be uncovered.</p><p>What would it be like to talk to her? Agatha wondered, leaning against the back of a chair as she watched the woman from across the room. Would her voice match the warmth of her eyes? Would she be one of those people who spoke with an easy, flowing rhythm that made conversation feel effortless, or would there be moments of shy hesitation, fleeting pauses that revealed the layers beneath her polished demeanor?</p><p>Agatha allowed herself a brief fantasy, imagining the two of them trading sly remarks and clever quips, their words laced with the kind of quiet humor that felt like a secret shared between kindred spirits. Perhaps the woman would surprise her, meeting her wit with her own sharp tongue, or perhaps she’d be the type who leaned in to listen, her attention unwavering, as if every word mattered.</p><p>She shook her head, laughing softly at herself. It wasn’t like her to get so caught up in a stranger—especially not here, in a room full of familiar faces and holiday chaos. And yet, there was something about this woman that called to her, a pull she couldn’t quite explain.</p><p>She couldn’t help but wonder—what was it about this stranger that had already captivated her? And, more importantly, would she get chance to speak to her?</p>

<p>Agatha circled the room before moving towards Nicholas and the rest of the older children, their noise grounding her amidst the whirlwind of activity in the living room.</p><p>The music pounding in her ears, Chappell Roan’s Hot To Go,  which had the children laughing and dancing. She lost herself in the moment, twirling around with the kids, singing along with exaggerated flair, her laughter bubbling up as Nicholas tried to out-dance her.</p><p>Her eyes lingered on a little boy standing shyly off to the side. His dark eyes darted between the other kids and his hands fidgeted with the hem of his sweater. The hearing aids perched on his ears caught her attention and a pang of understanding hit her. He wanted to join but didn’t know how. Instinct kicked in, a memory of her younger years surfacing—learning ASL when Nicholas was just a baby. Doctors had been concerned about his hearing after his premature birth and though the skill was never needed for him, it had stayed with her.</p><p>Smiling, Agatha began to sign along with the song’s lyrics, her movements fluid and exaggerated to match the music’s rhythm. The boy’s face lit up, his shy posture melting away as he slowly edged into the circle of dancing kids. Her heart swelled at his tentative grin as he began to move, first small steps, then bigger ones. Nicholas spotted him and grabbed his hand, pulling him fully into the group, where the laughter and dancing resumed in earnest.</p><p>When the song ended, Agatha scooped up Storey from the rug, brushing a stray curl from her daughter’s face. Storey giggled, grabbing at her mother’s necklace as Agatha made her way toward the snack table. She smiled to herself, feeling the warmth of the moment settle in her chest.</p><p>“Mama needs a snack, little star,” she murmured to Storey, her voice soft and affectionate as she scanned the table for something to nibble on.</p><p>She felt it then—a presence at her side. A subtle shift in the air, warm but hesitant. Turning, Agatha found herself face-to-face with the woman she had noticed earlier. Her sharp, ice-blue gaze locked onto rich brown eyes that shimmered with a mix of confidence and nerves.</p><p>“Impressive performance,” the woman said, her voice smooth but with a thread of unease that piqued Agatha’s curiosity.</p><p>Agatha offered a polite smile, adjusting Storey on her hip. “Thank you,” she said simply, her tone light but watchful. Her eyes darted to the living room, scanning the crowd. This woman didn’t seem like one of Wanda’s mom friends.</p><p>“You’re not here with the children, I take it,” Agatha ventured, her voice laced with a faint playfulness as she turned back to the stranger. “Doctor, I’m guessing? You work with Wanda?”</p><p>The woman chuckled, the sound low and warm. “You’re good,” she said, a small smile curving her lips. “I am. Rio Vidal. Wanda invited me.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly, studying her. There was something disarming about Rio—her calm demeanor, the way she held herself like someone used to being in control but not overbearing.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” she said, shifting Storey so she could extend a hand. “Nice to meet you, Doctor Vidal.”</p><p>“Call me Rio,” the woman replied, shaking her hand with a firm but friendly grip. Her attention shifted to Storey, who was happily gnawing on her teething ring. “And who’s this little one?”</p><p>“This is Storey,” Agatha said, her voice softening as she gazed at her daughter. “She’s the star of my show these days.” She glanced toward the living room, where Nicholas was still showing off his moves to the other kids. “And that’s the supporting act—my son, Nicholas.”</p><p>Rio followed her gaze, smiling as she took in the boy with the dimpled cheeks and the messy bun. “You’re lucky,” Rio said, her voice warm. “They’re both adorable.”</p><p>Agatha turned her attention back to Rio, one brow arching with faint amusement. “And what about you, Rio? No kids of your own?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, shaking her head. “Not yet. My life hasn’t exactly left room for that kind of commitment. But I can’t say I’ve ever met anyone who made parenthood look as easy as you do.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, a rich, musical sound that carried easily over the buzz of the party.</p><p>“Trust me, it’s anything but easy. Kids are chaos wrapped in charm.” She glanced at Storey, who was now tugging at her earring, then back at Rio with a knowing smirk. “But they’re worth every moment.”</p><p>Rio’s smile deepened, her gaze lingering on Agatha as if seeing something more than just the surface. “I believe you,” she said quietly.</p><p>Agatha shifted, suddenly aware of the intensity in Rio’s eyes. It wasn’t unwelcome, but it was unexpected. Clearing her throat, she turned back to the snack table, her fingers brushing over the selection. “Well, Doctor Vidal, if you’re going to be sticking around, I hope you’re prepared. Wanda’s parties tend to get... lively.”</p><p>Rio laughed, a genuine, easy sound that seemed to lighten the room. “I’ll keep that in mind,” she said.</p><p>Agatha gave her a sidelong glance, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. “Good. Now, if you’ll excuse me, Storey and I have some snacks to commandeer before Nicholas eats the place out of house and home.”</p><p>As she turned to walk away, she caught Rio watching her, a look of quiet admiration on her face. Agatha felt a flicker of something she couldn’t quite name, but she brushed it aside, focusing instead on her daughter’s laughter and the hum of the party around her until she realised Rio had followed her.</p><p>Agatha found herself standing at the edge of the living room with Rio, their conversation flowing far more easily than she’d anticipated. At first, Agatha had been answering questions out of politeness—Rio asking about her life, her work, even what brought her to the party—but as time went on, the banter between them became surprisingly engaging. Agatha was adept at deflecting attention when needed, but she found herself leaning into Rio’s questions, intrigued by the woman’s thoughtful curiosity.</p><p>“So,” Rio said, resting her elbow casually on the arm of a nearby chair, “what exactly do you do, Agatha? Wanda said something about you having your own business, but she didn’t elaborate.”</p><p>Agatha allowed a sly smile to tug at her lips. “That’s because Wanda doesn’t understand half of what I do. I run a consulting firm—strategic problem-solving for companies in trouble. Sometimes it’s about managing PR disasters, sometimes it’s a logistical nightmare. Either way, I swoop in, fix things, and then vanish like smoke.”</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, clearly impressed. “A fixer, huh? That sounds... intense. And very impressive. Do you like it?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, though there was a glint of pride in her eyes. “I like that it keeps me sharp. I get bored easily if I’m not being challenged, and this job offers no shortage of challenges. It also gives me the flexibility to be with my kids, so there’s that.” She tilted her head. “What about you? You said said you’re a doctor?”</p><p>Rio nodded, taking a sip from the glass of wine she’d picked up. “I am—a pediatric surgeon, to be specific.”</p><p>“Pediatric surgeon?” Agatha echoed, her tone genuinely impressed. “Saving kids’ lives every day? That’s... admirable.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, a hint of modesty coloring her expression. “I wouldn’t say ‘every day.’ But it’s fulfilling work, even when it’s hard.”</p><p>She looked at Agatha with interest. “What about you? Do you ever find your work fulfilling?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened as she glanced toward the living room where Nicholas was laughing with another child. “It’s not the work itself that’s fulfilling. It’s knowing it lets me give my kids the life they deserve. That’s enough for me.”</p><p>Rio nodded thoughtfully, her respect for Agatha deepening. “It must be exhausting, balancing everything. But you make it look... seamless.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, a knowing glint in her eye. “Oh, it’s chaos most days. But I’m good at bluffing.”</p><p>Their conversation shifted naturally, flowing from career talk to lighter topics.</p><p>“What’s your favorite film?” Rio asked, leaning casually against the wall as though they had all the time in the world.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, considering her answer. “You’re asking me to choose just one? That’s cruel.”</p><p>“Fine,” Rio teased, her eyes glinting. “I’ll make it easier. Top three.”</p><p>Agatha thought for a moment before replying, “Practical Magic, obviously, for the aesthetic. The Godfather, because who doesn’t love a family crime saga? And... The Princess Bride. It’s a classic.”</p><p>Rio laughed, the sound warm and genuine. “You contain multitudes, Agatha Harkness. I didn’t see The Princess Bride coming.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “I like a good story. What about you?”</p><p>“Good Will Hunting,” Rio said immediately. “Coco—and yes, I cried like a baby. And... The Martian. I’m a sucker for a survival story.”</p><p>“Eclectic taste,” Agatha mused, her smile widening.</p><p>They moved on to books, then festive traditions, the conversation winding through topics as if they’d known each other for years. Agatha found herself marveling at how much she was enjoying Rio’s company. She wasn’t sure what she’d expected when the woman had approached her earlier, but she hadn’t anticipated this easy camaraderie.</p><p>And yet, as much as Agatha was drawn to Rio—her intelligence, her humor, the warmth in her eyes—she couldn’t shake the nagging thought that Rio’s interest in her was purely platonic. After all, she had two children, and for most people, that was an immediate deterrent.</p><p>By the time the evening began to wind down, Agatha reluctantly excused herself to start gathering Nicholas and Storey’s things. She found Nicholas near the snack table, his face sticky with frosting from a cupcake he’d clearly devoured in secret.</p><p>“Nicholas,” she said, her voice stern but laced with affection, “you’re supposed to ask before raiding the desserts.”</p><p>He grinned sheepishly. “But they’re really good, Mama!”</p><p>She sighed, wiping his face with a napkin before turning her attention to Storey, who was starting to get fussy. As she adjusted the baby bag on her shoulder and prepared to leave, she heard a familiar voice behind her.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>She turned to find Rio standing there, her expression uncharacteristically nervous.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, curious. “Yes?”</p><p>Rio hesitated for only a moment before taking a small step closer. “I was wondering if you’d like to grab coffee sometime. You know, when you’re not running the world or being a supermom.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught completely off guard. She opened her mouth to respond, then closed it again, her brain scrambling to process what she’d just heard.</p><p>“I’d like that, Rio.”</p><p>She handed Rio a business card, scrawling her personal number on the back. “Call me. But fair warning—I might end up bringing the kids, their trouble for everyone else.”</p><p>Rio grinned back at her, causing butterflies to flit within her stomach. “I wouldn’t mind if you did.”</p><p>As Rio walked away, Agatha felt a flicker of something she hadn’t felt in a long time—hope. She glanced down at her children, her heart swelling with affection. Maybe, just maybe, there was room in her life for something—or someone—new.</p><p>As Agatha drove through the snowy night, the hum of the car engine filling the quiet, she couldn’t stop her thoughts from drifting back to Rio. The way Rio’s eyes had lingered on hers, warm and genuine, and the easy flow of their conversation replayed in her mind like a favorite tune. She glanced in the rearview mirror at Nicholas, who was sleepily humming to himself, his cupcake-sticky fingers clutching a toy car, and at Storey, who was snuggled into her car seat, her soft breaths audible even over the rumble of the heater.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile. The party had been a success—no meltdowns, no mishaps—but it was Rio who occupied most of her thoughts. She’d been caught off guard when Rio asked her to get coffee, so much so that her heart had skipped a beat.</p><p>It had been years since anyone had expressed interest in her in that way. And honestly? She hadn’t expected it, not when she had two kids in tow and a chaotic life that left little room for romance.</p><p>For the first time in a long while, Agatha felt a flicker of nervous excitement.</p><p>She tightened her grip on the wheel as she turned down the long, winding road to her house, the snowflakes catching in the beams of her headlights like scattered stardust. Was it silly to feel giddy over a coffee invitation? Probably. But there was something about Rio—her confidence, her kindness, the way she’d seemed genuinely interested in more than just surface pleasantries—that had made an impression on Agatha.</p><p>When she pulled into the driveway, the familiar sight of her snow-dusted home came into view. Nicholas perked up, rubbing his eyes. “Mama, can we have hot cocoa before bed?”</p><p>Agatha smiled softly. “You’ve already had enough sugar to last a week, mister. Let’s get you both upstairs and settled, okay?”</p><p>Nicholas groaned in protest but didn’t fight her as she carried Storey inside and coaxed him to follow. The house was warm and inviting, the faint scent of cinnamon still lingering from the morning’s baking experiment. She changed Storey into her pajamas, humming a lullaby as she rocked her to sleep. Nicholas climbed into bed with minimal fuss, his eyelids already drooping.</p><p>“Goodnight, sweetheart,” Agatha whispered, brushing a strand of hair from his forehead.</p><p>“Goodnight, Mama,” he murmured, his voice heavy with sleep.</p><p>When the house was finally quiet, Agatha poured herself a glass of wine and sank onto the living room couch, the fire crackling softly in the hearth. She stared at her phone, wondering if she actually would hear from Rio.</p><p>She swirled the wine in her glass, chewing on her bottom lip. It had been a long time since she’d let herself think about dating. She’d been so focused on her children, her business and the delicate balance of juggling both. And yet, here she was, sitting on her couch, feeling like a teenager waiting to see if her crush would text first.</p><p>“Ridiculous,” she muttered to herself, but she couldn’t suppress the small smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>Rio had seemed so genuine, so easy to talk to. The memory of her voice—low, smooth, and tinged with humor—lingered in Agatha’s mind. And the way Rio had said she wouldn’t mind if Agatha brought the kids? That had struck a chord. Most people backed away at the mention of children, especially two of them, but Rio hadn’t hesitated.</p><p>Agatha leaned back against the cushions, a soft sigh escaping her lips. Maybe it was nothing. Maybe Rio wouldn’t call, and this little spark of excitement would fade like so many others.</p><p>But then again, maybe she would.</p><p>As she climbed the stairs, the baby monitor gripped tightly in her hand, she tried to push the "what ifs" from her mind. The evening had been full of unexpected moments—pleasant, even thrilling ones—but she didn’t want to let herself dwell on them. Hope was a dangerous thing, fragile as glass. She focused instead on the soft hum of the monitor and the steady rise and fall of the children's breaths. It comforted her, anchored her to the present.</p><p>In her bedroom, the soft light of a bedside lamp cast a golden glow on the walls. She showered, the hot water washing away the day’s weariness and leaving her skin pink and warm. She slipped into her black silk pajamas, the fabric smooth against her skin, a small indulgence she rarely allowed herself. Quietly, she padded down the hall, peeking in on Storey and Nicholas.</p><p>Nicholas was curled around his favorite stuffed rabbit, his chest rising and falling with the rhythmic cadence of deep sleep. Storey, sprawled in her crib, let out a small, contented sigh as she dreamed. She lingered for a moment, taking in the sweetness of their innocence, before retreating to her own room.</p><p>When she finally climbed into bed, the sheets cool and inviting, her mind was still buzzing. But sleep found her quickly, pulling her into its embrace.</p><p>Her dreams were vivid, full of potential futures, strange and enticing. She found herself in a sunlit café, her hands wrapped around a steaming cup of coffee. Across from her sat Rio, her smile easy and warm, her eyes glinting with some unspoken thought. They talked, the words flowing effortlessly, their laughter blending with the hum of the café. Time seemed to bend, stretching and folding around them as though nothing else existed.</p><p>The dream shifted, as dreams do, and now they were walking side by side in a park, the air crisp with the bite of autumn. Leaves crunched beneath their feet, and she felt his hand brush against hers. It was small, almost accidental, but electric. She turned to her, her expression open, vulnerable. For a moment, the world stood still.</p><p>Another shift—a different dream entirely. She was in her living room, her children playing on the floor. Rio was there too, sitting cross-legged as she built a tower of blocks with Nicholas. Story tugged on her sleeve, holding up a book and she obliged her with a theatrical reading that had them all laughing. The scene was impossibly warm, almost too perfect.</p><p>She stirred in her sleep, a soft smile tugging at the corners of her lips, as the dreams wove a tapestry of hope and possibility.</p><p>It was then that her phone buzzed softly on the nightstand. A text illuminated the screen, casting a faint glow in the dark room. It read:<br/>
Hi, it’s Rio. I’m really glad we met tonight. Looking forward to coffee.</p><p>The words, though simple, carried a weight of promise. They lingered there, unseen but waiting for her, as she continued to dream of a life that might be just within reach.</p>

<p>Agatha’s phone buzzed with her alarm on her nightstand as the early morning light filtered through the curtains. She blinked a few times, groaning softly as she stretched. It was still too early for anything coherent, but her curiosity got the better of her. She reached for her phone, her heart skipping a beat when she saw the text that had arrived last night.</p><p>Rio: Hi, it’s Rio. I’m really glad we met tonight. Looking forward to coffee.</p><p>Agatha stared at the screen, a smile tugging at her lips. Rio had actually texted. She’d been so sure last night’s connection would fade into the chaos of their separate lives—a fleeting moment at the Christmas party where they’d talked over gingerbread and bonded over the absurdity of holiday games and traditions.</p><p>But now the butterflies were back, flitting nervously in her chest.</p><p>"Was it coffee or...a coffee date?" she thought, biting her lip. A thousand "what ifs" tumbled through her head as she got out of bed and began her usual morning hustle.</p><p>Was Rio even interested in her that way? What if she was just being friendly? What if Agatha was reading too much into this?</p><p>She shook her head, determined to keep her cool. "Pull it together, Harkness," she muttered under her breath as she moved into the bathroom, brushing her teeth quickly before heading to check on the kids.</p><p>The house was awake, the soft hum of life filling their open-plan kitchen and living space. Storey was babbling in her high chair, smearing oatmeal across her face with sticky fingers. Nicholas, who had declared his independence on everything except for tying shoelaces, sat at the table with a bowl of cereal.</p><p>“Mama, I don’t need you to make my lunch anymore,” Nicholas declared, his small chest puffing out with pride.</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Agatha replied, smirking as she grabbed his favorite dinosaur lunchbox from the counter. “And what would you pack if you did it yourself? Cookies and...more cookies?”</p><p>Nicholas grinned sheepishly. “Maybe.”</p><p>“Thought so.” She handed him a piece of toast, already buttered. “Eat that, Mr. Big Five, or you’ll be starving by the time snack time rolls around.”</p><p>Storey banged her spoon against the high chair tray, giggling as bits of oatmeal flew onto the floor.</p><p>“Storey!” Agatha sighed, grabbing a washcloth to wipe her daughter’s cheeks. “You’re supposed to eat it, not wear it.”</p><p>Storey responded with a squeal of delight, smearing the oatmeal even further.<br/>
It was a familiar chaos, and despite the hectic pace, Agatha loved these moments. But today, her mind was only half here. The other half was replaying last night. Rio’s easy laugh, her kind eyes, and the way she’d leaned in slightly during their conversation, as if she really wanted to hear every word Agatha said.</p><p>The doorbell chimed, snapping her out of her thoughts.</p><p>“Agatha, it’s me!” came Sharon’s cheerful voice.</p><p>Agatha looked to the doorway to find Sharon, her ever-reliable nanny, already holding a fresh cup of tea in one hand and a warm smile on her face. Sharon was in her sixties, with blonde hair in a bobbed cut and an air of calm that had a magical way of soothing even the most frazzled mornings.</p><p>“Morning, Sharon,” Agatha said, stepping aside to let her in.</p><p>“Good morning, my darlings!” Sharon greeted as she swept into the kitchen. She bent down to Nicholas’s level, inspecting his chosen outfit. “Well, don’t you look handsome today!”</p><p>Nicholas beamed, and Sharon turned her attention to Storey, scooping her up from the high chair. “Oh, you’re as messy as ever, aren’t you, my love? Let’s get you cleaned up while your mama gets ready.”</p><p>Agatha smiled gratefully. “You’re a lifesaver, as always. I’ll be out of here in ten.”</p><p>As she rushed back to her room to get dressed, she tried not to overthink things. She pulled on a crisp white shirt and her favorite navy trousers, tossing on a matching blazer for good measure. Should she text Rio back now? Or would that seem too eager?</p><p>Before she could debate it further, her phone buzzed again.</p><p>Rio: Good morning, I’m free Saturday if that works for you?</p><p>Agatha froze, her heart racing. This was actually happening. She reread her message twice before sending, but panicked that it was maybe too forward.</p><p>Her lips curled into a smile as she typed back:<br/>
Agatha: I can do Saturday, it’s a date?</p><p>She hit send and exhaled, her nerves turning into excitement.  The response from Rio was immediate.</p><p>Rio: Great. It’s a date - I’ll send you the address, see you Saturday</p><p>As she headed back to the kitchen, ready to face the day, Sharon looked up from where she was wiping Storey’s hands.</p><p>“Good news, dear?” Sharon asked, a twinkle in her eye.</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha said, unable to keep the grin off her face.</p><p>Nicholas, ever the curious five-year-old, tilted his head. “Why are you smiling like that, Mama?”</p><p>“Because,” Agatha replied, ruffling his hair, “sometimes, I’m just very happy.”</p><p>With that, she kissed both her children goodbye and grabbed her bag. As she stepped outside into the crisp winter morning, the thought of seeing Rio again filled her with hope—a spark of something new, something just for her.</p><p>As Agatha stepped into the sleek glass elevator of her firm’s high-rise office building, she hoped her good mood would last. The faint hum of classical music doing little to calm the tension she already felt building in her shoulders. By the time she reached the 27th floor, her game face was firmly in place.</p><p>Her firm, Harkness Consulting, was a powerhouse in the corporate world, advising on everything from mergers and acquisitions to crisis management. The office buzzed with quiet intensity, employees working diligently under the watchful eye of their formidable boss. Agatha’s reputation as a sharp, no-nonsense leader was well-earned, and while her employees respected her, there was an undeniable air of trepidation whenever she entered a room.</p><p>“Good morning, Ms. Harkness,” said William, her assistant, falling into step beside her as she exited the elevator.</p><p>William, or teen as Agatha affectionately referred to him, was a composed and efficient young man in his late teens who had mastered the art of keeping up with Agatha’s pace.</p><p>“Morning Teen,” Agatha replied, her tone brisk. “What’s on the agenda?”</p><p>William flipped through his tablet as they walked. “You’ve got a client call at 9:15 with Stark Tech about their restructuring proposal. At 10:30, a meeting with the legal team regarding the New York acquisition. Lunch with the CFO of Shield Industries at 12:45. And the pitch review with the marketing team is scheduled for 3:00. Oh, and we need your approval on the quarterly financials by end of day.”</p><p>Agatha absorbed it all with a nod, her heels clicking sharply against the marble floor as she approached her corner office. “Make sure the Stark team has the updated projections ready for the call. And push the pitch review to 2:30—I want to leave a buffer before the legal meeting.”</p><p>“Understood,” William said, jotting down notes as Agatha entered her office.</p><p>The room was as pristine and commanding as its owner—floor-to-ceiling windows offered a sweeping view of the city, and the minimalist decor exuded modern elegance. A single framed photo of Nicholas and Storey sat on her desk, a subtle reminder of her softer side, though few ever saw it.</p><p>The day unfolded in a whirlwind of activity.<br/>
The 9:15 call turned into a tense negotiation session, with the CEO of Stark Tech pushing back on her team’s recommendations. Agatha’s voice remained calm but firm as she dismantled their objections one by one.</p><p>“Let me be clear,” she said, her tone icy enough to silence the room. “If you go with your current plan, you’ll be looking at a 20% revenue drop in the next quarter. My team’s proposal mitigates that risk. The numbers don’t lie.”</p><p>By the end of the call, the CEO begrudgingly agreed to adopt her recommendations, and Agatha allowed herself a small, satisfied smile.</p><p>The rest of the day was no less demanding. The legal meeting required her to navigate a web of potential liabilities, and the lunch with the CFO of Sheild Industries was a delicate dance of schmoozing and strategy. By mid-afternoon, her pitch review had her team sweating under her critical gaze.</p><p>“This doesn’t sell the vision,” Agatha said, tapping the presentation slide with her pen. “I want less jargon and more impact. The client doesn’t care about buzzwords; they care about results. Rewrite it and have it on my desk by 5:00.”</p><p>“Yes, Ms. Harkness,” the head of marketing stammered, scrambling to take notes.</p><p>By the time the clock hit 5:30, Agatha was finally able to lean back in her chair, exhausted but satisfied with what she’d accomplished. She checked her phone, smiling faintly at a new photo Sharon had sent of Storey covered in paint from an art project. Nicholas was in the background, holding up a slightly lopsided gingerbread house.</p><p>She texted back: Love it. I’ll be home soon. Save some gingerbread for me.</p><p>The thought of returning to the chaos of home felt like a balm after the relentless pace of her workday. She packed up her bag, making a mental note to double-check Nicholas’s school schedule and drop-off times tomorrow.</p><p>As she stepped into the elevator, she found herself thinking of Rio again. The prospect of their date in a few days felt like a small, thrilling escape—a chance to be someone other than the powerhouse CEO or the harried single mom.</p><p>The streets outside were alive with the glittering lights of the city as Agatha made her way home. When she finally stepped through the front door, the sound of Nicholas’s laughter and Storey’s babbling greeted her like music.</p><p>“Mama!” Nicholas ran up to her, throwing his arms around her waist.</p><p>Agatha knelt down, hugging him tightly. “Hey, buddy. Did you save me any gingerbread?”</p><p>“Maybe,” he said with a mischievous grin.<br/>
Storey crawled over, her hands still sticky with paint, and Agatha scooped her up, not caring about the mess.</p><p>“Welcome home, Agatha,” Sharon said from the kitchen, where she was washing up.</p><p>“Thanks, Sharon,” Agatha said, her shoulders finally relaxing. “How were they today?”</p><p>“Perfect angels, of course,” Sharon said with a wink.</p><p>Agatha smiled as she carried Storey to the couch, where Nicholas had already started telling her about his day. For the first time all day, the weight on her shoulders seemed to lift.</p><p>As she kissed the top of Storey’s head, she thought about Rio again, her heart fluttering with anticipation. In the chaos of her life, maybe—just maybe—there was room for something new.</p>

<p>Saturday arrived faster than Agatha had anticipated. The week had been relentless, filled with putting out corporate fires and juggling responsibilities that seemed to pile up endlessly. By the time the weekend rolled around, she was more than ready for a break. The prospect of a few days off was a relief in itself, but the real highlight was the coffee date she’d arranged with Rio. A warm smile crossed her lips at the thought—Rio had been on Agatha’s mind more often than she cared to admit since the night of Wandas party. Meeting her for their coffee date felt like the perfect reward after a grueling week.</p><p>That was, of course, until Saturday morning threw a wrench in her plans.</p><p>Agatha had intended to leave the children with Vision (since Wanda was on shift) for a few hours so she could focus on her date. Nicholas, as expected, had bounded into the house without hesitation, eager to spend the day with his best friends and their dad who was just as goofy as the group of children. Storey, however, didn’t go as easily. As Agatha tried to pass her over into Visions waiting arms to handher off, her little arms clung to her neck with surprising strength, while she let out a piercing scream that made Agatha wince.</p><p>“Mama, mama!” Storey babbled between sobs, burying her tear-streaked face into Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Agatha took a deep breath, gently stroking her daughter’s curls in an attempt to soothe her, but it was no use. Storey’s little hands gripped her tighter, and her cries only grew louder, reaching a piercing level.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Vision, who looked on with an understanding but slightly helpless expression.</p><p>“She’s usually fine with you,” Agatha murmured, trying to mask the worry creeping into her tone.</p><p>Vision nodded sympathetically. “Maybe she’s having one of those days.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, conflicted. This wasn’t how she’d envisioned her morning going. She wanted to make a good impression on Rio—this wasn’t just any coffee date, after all, it was a first date. There was something about Rio that made Agatha’s heart flutter, a sensation she hadn’t felt in a long time. But as she held Storey’s trembling little body, it became clear that leaving her behind wasn’t an option.</p><p>With a resigned sigh, Agatha made her decision. She adjusted Storey on her hip, rubbing soothing circles into her baby’s back as turned back to Vision. “I guess she’s coming with me,” she said, trying to sound more confident than she felt.</p><p>After all, Rio had mentioned that she didn’t mind if Agatha brought the kids. Still, this wasn’t quite the impression she’d wanted to make. As much as she loved her children—and she loved them fiercely—she couldn’t help but feel a pang of anxiety at the thought of bringing Storey along on what she hoped would be the first of many dates with Rio.</p><p>By the time they arrived at the café, Agatha’s nerves were running high. The small, charming café was bustling with activity, the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingling with the sound of cheerful chatter as she selected a corner table, sitting storey on her knee and facing the doorway to wait for Rio.</p><p>Agatha glanced up as the bell above the café door jingled, her lips curling into a smile when she spotted Rio. She raised a hand, motioning her over. Storey remained perched on her lap, bundled up in a soft cream sweater. Her small hands were wrapped around her well-loved toy fox, which she clutched tightly as her eyes darted around the bustling café.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha greeted warmly as her guest approached, “Glad you could make it.”</p><p>Rio’s face lit up with a smile as she slid into the seat across from her. “Hey,” she said, her gaze flicking down to the little girl in Agatha’s lap. “And hello there, cutie.”</p><p>Storey responded with a delighted giggle, her wide eyes peeking out from behind her fox as she gave Rio an almost bashful wave, tears long forgotten. Agatha chuckled softly, adjusting Storey on her lap. “She insisted on coming with me. Lately, she’s been in a phase where she doesn’t like to let me out of her sight.”</p><p>“I don’t mind at all,” Rio assured her, her tone sincere. “She’s absolutely adorable.”</p><p>They placed their orders—Agatha going for her usual strong black coffee while Rio opted for a frothy cappuccino—and quickly fell into a rhythm of conversation. The topics flowed easily, continuing from their conversations at the party: Rio’s move to the city, Agatha’s whirlwind of work responsibilities and the delicate balancing act of motherhood.</p><p>At one point, Rio paused, hesitating slightly as she weighed whether to ask what was on her mind. Finally, curiosity got the better of her. “So… where’s their dad in all of this?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, momentarily caught off guard by the question, was this not an actual date, had she misread the situation completely?</p><p>For a brief moment, Agatha’s masks went up, her expression closed off, but then she relaxed, pasting on a false smile to hide the uncertainty she was feeling.</p><p>“Ah, I see where you’re coming from,” she said lightly, shifting Storey as she began to doze off in her arms.</p><p>Rio immediately looked apologetic, her brow furrowing. “I didn’t mean to pry. It’s just… you make it all seem so effortless. I can’t imagine doing all this on your own.”</p><p>Agatha’s scoffed in response, effortless was the further thing from the truth. “No offense taken. But the truth is, there’s no dad in the picture. Both Nicholas and Storey are adopted.”</p><p>Rio blinked, Agatha could tell she was taken aback by the revelation. “Oh. I wouldn’t have guessed—they look like you.”</p><p>“It’s a common assumption,” Agatha said with a shrug, glancing down at Storey’s serene little face as she gently stroked her daughter’s soft curls.</p><p>Rio’s curiosity deepened, and she leaned forward slightly. “If you’re comfortable sharing, I’d love to hear how it all came about.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her gaze growing distant for a moment as she looked out the window, as though gathering her thoughts. “I adopted Nicholas first. That was about five years ago. I’d always wanted children, but I was so focused on my career that I didn’t think it was possible. Then one day, completely out of the blue, a social worker I’d done some volunteer work with reached out to me. She told me about this baby boy—a two-month-old who had just been placed in the system.”</p><p>Rio listened intently, her attention fixed on Agatha as she continued.</p><p>“He was born premature,” Agatha explained, her voice softening as a gentle smile spread across her face. “His birth mother… well, she wasn’t in a position to take care of him, and the agency was having a hard time placing him because of his health issues. But the moment I saw him…” She paused, her smile growing wistful. “I knew he was mine. He was so tiny, so fragile, but so full of life. Bringing him home was the best decision I ever made.”</p><p>Rio smiled at the way Agatha’s voice filled with love when she spoke about her son.</p><p>“He’s lucky to have you,” she said sincerely.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, her eyes crinkling with a soft laugh. “I’m the lucky one. And then, last year, the same social worker called me again. She told me Nicholas’s birth mother had another baby—a little girl. She asked if I would consider taking her, too.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows lifted, “And you said yes?”</p><p>“It wasn’t an easy decision,” Agatha admitted. “I was already balancing a lot with work and Nicholas, and I knew bringing a newborn into the mix would be a challenge. But when I met her…” She glanced down at Storey, her hand lightly brushing her daughter’s cheek. “She was perfect. She looks so much like Nicholas. I couldn’t say no.”</p><p>Rio’s gazed softly as she looked at the little girl sleeping soundly in Agatha’s arms. “That’s incredible. You’ve given them such a beautiful life. It’s inspiring, honestly.”</p><p>For a moment, they sat in companionable silence, the hum of café chatter and soft jazz music filling the air. Then Rio broke the quiet with a playful smile.</p><p>“So… no dad, huh?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, amused at her quip- she was flirting, she was definitely flirting. “Not even a whisper of one. Why? Were you hoping for some competition?”</p><p>She could see she’d caught her off guard, Rio laughed, her cheeks warming. “I wouldn’t dare compete with a man who doesn’t exist. But knowing there’s no dad does make me feel a little less guilty about finding myself… intrigued.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, enjoying the shift in tone. “Intrigued, huh?”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, her smile growing. “Very.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, shaking her head slightly, though the faint flush in her cheeks betrayed her own intrigue. “Well, I suppose I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>“It’s definitely a compliment,” Rio said softly, as her gaze held Agatha’s for a moment longer than necessary.</p><p>As the café began to quiet down, Agatha glanced at her watch, realizing it was time to wrap things up. Storey was fast asleep in her lap, her little hands still clutching the toy fox as her chest rose and fell in peaceful rhythm. Agatha couldn’t help but brush a soft kiss to the top of her daughter’s head before turning her attention back to Rio.</p><p>“This was really nice,” Agatha said, offering Rio a warm smile. “I’m glad we could make it happen.”</p><p>“Me too,” Rio replied, her smile as radiant. She gestured to Storey with a soft laugh. “And she’s clearly had a good time.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, looking down at Storey. “That’s no small feat. She’s a tough audience when she wants to be.”</p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair, her expression lingering somewhere between relaxed and thoughtful. “You’re doing amazing, Agatha. Balancing work, parenting, and still finding time for coffee.”</p><p>“I always have time for coffee?” Agatha teased lightly.</p><p>Rio tilted her head as though analysing her, her gaze warm and steady.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flush slightly and she looked away for a moment, reaching for her bag. “Well, I should get going. Nicholas is at a Wanda and Visions house and I dread to think the rings they’ve run around vision.”</p><p>Rio nodded, standing as Agatha carefully adjusted Storey in her arms. She reached out, almost instinctively, to hold the door open for them as they exited the café. The winter air nipped at them, but the warmth between them lingered as they stood by Agatha’s car.</p><p>“I’ll see you around?” Rio asked, her voice soft but hopeful.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, hoping for more—hoping for Rio to suggest another date, or at least to make some sort of move. But when Rio simply smiled and gave a small wave as she stepped backwards, Agatha forced herself to smile back, nodding.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha said. “See you around.”</p><p>As she drove to Vision and Wanda’s house to pick up Nicholas, Agatha’s thoughts spiraled. She replayed every moment of the date in her mind, analysing Rio’s every word, every gesture. Had she imagined the connection? Was Rio not interested? Was bringing Storey along too much?</p><p>Agatha muttered to herself, glancing in the rearview mirror where Storey snoozed peacefully in her car seat. “Maybe she didn’t feel the same spark I did.”</p><p>By the time she pulled into Vision and Wanda’s driveway, she was thoroughly tangled in her thoughts. She took a steadying breath before unbuckling Storey and making her way to the door.</p><p>Wanda answered, home from her shift at the hospital, her bright smile greeting them immediately. “Agatha! How was the date?”</p><p>“It was…” Agatha paused, adjusting Storey as she tried to find the right words. “It was nice.”</p><p>Wanda tilted her head, catching the hesitation in her voice. “But?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “But she didn’t ask for a second date.”</p><p>Vision appeared in the hallway, Nicholas trailing behind him with a grin on his face. “Mama!” Nicholas called, running up to hug her legs.</p><p>“Hey, Mister,” Agatha said, her voice softening as she ruffled his hair.</p><p>Vision smiled politely. “It’s possible she’s waiting for you to make the next move, you know. Perhaps she didn’t want to seem too forward.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha said, though doubt still clung to her.</p><p>“Do you like her?” Wanda asked gently.</p><p>Agatha nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips. “Yeah. I really do.”</p><p>“Then call her,” Wanda said simply.</p><p>“Call her?” Agatha echoed, her brow furrowing. “Isn’t that… I don’t know, too forward?”</p><p>“Not if you’re interested,” Wanda said with a shrug. “Rio seems the type who might not want to overstep. If you like her, tell her. Life’s too short for overthinking.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to protest but closed it again, considering Wanda’s words.</p><p>By the time she loaded Nicholas and Storey back into the car, Wanda’s advice was still echoing in her mind. Maybe she was overthinking. Maybe she was letting her nerves get the better of her.</p><p>As the evening stretched on and her children’s bedtime routines were completed, Agatha found herself sitting on the couch with her phone in her hand. She stared at Rio’s number in her contacts, her thumb hovering over the screen.</p><p>With a deep breath, she tapped out a message.</p><p>Agatha: Hey, I just wanted to say I really enjoyed today. If you’re interested, maybe we could do it again sometime—my treat this time?</p><p>She stared at the message for what felt like forever before hitting send, her heart pounding in her chest.</p><p>Now, all she could do was wait.</p><p>Not even 10 minutes later, her phone buzzed on the coffee table, she froze mid-step, halfway through tidying the mess made by her children, a toy dinosaur clutched in her hand. Her heart leapt as she set the toy down and reached for the phone, the screen lighting up with Rio’s reply.</p><p>Rio: I really enjoyed today too. I’d love to see you again—Thursday evening is the only night I’m not on shift this week. Would that work for you?</p><p>Agatha smiled, relief washing over her. It wasn’t lost on her that Rio was carving out a rare free evening just for her.</p><p>She quickly typed back:</p><p>Agatha: Thursday works perfectly. Dinner?</p><p>The reply came almost instantly.</p><p>Rio: Dinner sounds great, but I insist it’s on me—consider it my way of apologising in advance for how busy I am - I’d have liked to see you again sooner.</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly, settling onto the couch. She felt like a teenage girl again, butterflies fluttering as her crush confirmed they liked her back.</p><p>Agatha: You don’t need to apologize for being busy, I’m looking forward to seeing you again.</p><p>Rio: Me too. Thursday, then. I’ll message you the details closer to the day.</p><p>Agatha set her phone down, a soft smile lingering on her lips. The weight of her earlier overthinking began to lift, replaced by a flicker of excitement.</p><p>She looked around the quiet living room, the toys now neatly packed away and the house calm with both children sound asleep. The anticipation for her next date, the flutter of hope for something new—it was an intoxicating feeling.</p><p>“Thursday,” she murmured to herself, leaning back against the couch cushions. “That gives me a few days to not to overthink this.”</p><p>Easier said than done. But for now, she allowed herself the luxury of simply looking forward to seeing Rio again, sans any children.</p>

<p>Agatha sat at the dining table, her laptop open but her focus drifting between the documents on the screen and the lively scene around her. She adjusted her glasses and glanced at the clock—it was nearing 3 p.m., and her to-do list still felt insurmountable.</p><p>Nicholas, having finished kindergarten at 1pm, sprawled on the living room rug with his Lego bricks, was deeply engrossed in assembling what he proudly declared to be a "T-Rex with wings." The five-year-old's face was scrunched in concentration as he searched for a tiny green piece amidst the colorful chaos.</p><p>“Mama, do dinosaurs always have tails?” he called out without looking up, his tone serious as though the matter were of global importance.</p><p>“They did,” Agatha replied, pausing her typing to give him a smile. “Unless you’re inventing a whole new species over there, Dr. Nicholas.”</p><p>“I’m making the Flyosaurus Rex,” he announced with a triumphant wave of a half-finished creature, its stubby wings sticking out at odd angles.</p><p>Agatha chuckled and returned her gaze to the laptop, her fingers moving briskly over the keyboard. “Sounds groundbreaking. Paleontologists everywhere are going to thank you.”</p><p>From her side, Storey’s babbles grew louder, punctuated by the wet smacking sound of mashed banana meeting high-chair tray. Agatha turned her head just in time to catch her daughter grinning mischievously, her tiny hands gleaming with banana as she smeared it onto the plastic tray.</p><p>“Storey, are you trying to paint a masterpiece?” Agatha asked, half-teasing, half-resigned as she reached for a napkin.</p><p>“Ma-ma-ma!” Storey replied gleefully, slapping her sticky hands down and sending the remnants of her snack splattering onto the floor.</p><p>“Alright, little Picasso,” Agatha said, standing up to wipe her daughter’s face and tray. She crouched down, eye-level with Storey, and gently cleaned her cheeks. “At least you’re cute enough to get away with it.”</p><p>Nicholas rolled onto his back and stared at the ceiling, still clutching his Lego dinosaur.</p><p>“Mama, can we have cookies later? After Storey stops being messy?”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, returning to the dining table and her laptop. “I’ll think about it. Cookies are for kids who clean up after themselves.”</p><p>Nicholas groaned theatrically, and Storey squealed as though agreeing with her brother’s protest. Agatha smiled to herself as she refocused on her work, grateful for these messy, chaotic moments that filled the house with so much life.</p><p>Though she’d spent the day working from home to maximize her time with the kids, Agatha’s mind was spinning like a hamster on a wheel. Tonight, she had a proper date with Rio - a fact that sent nervous flutters through her stomach every time she thought about it.</p><p>She picked up her phone for the third time in five minutes, rereading the message Rio had sent earlier:</p><p>“Hi! Looking forward to tonight. Bistro Étoile at 7. It’s a cozy little spot with great reviews—hope you like it!”</p><p>Agatha stared at the text like it held the secrets of the universe. "What if I’m too casual? What if I show up looking like I tried too hard not to try too hard?" She sighed dramatically and ran her hand through her hair, glancing toward where Nicholas was now attaching what looked like a dragon head to his Lego dinosaur.</p><p>“Mama, can we have cookies now?Nicholas called out, dragging the word "now" as though he'd been deprived for days.</p><p>“Not yet, Nicky,” Agatha replied, forcing herself to sound cheerful. “How about some apple slices instead?”</p><p>Nicholas collapsed backward onto the rug with the despair of a Shakespearean hero. “Fine,” he groaned, his voice muffled as he buried his face in the carpet.</p><p>She bit back a laugh, slicing up an apple and placing the pieces on a small plate with a blob of peanut butter. “You’ll survive. Here, fuel for the next phase of your Flyosaurus Rex.”</p><p>He accepted the plate with a dramatic sigh but perked up when she added, “Just don’t feed it to your dinosaur—apples give them gas.”</p><p>Nicholas giggled, and she turned her attention to Storey, who had somehow managed to smear banana in her hair during the briefest of distractions.</p><p>“And you, Picasso,” she muttered, grabbing a damp cloth and tackling the mess on her baby’s chubby cheeks.</p><p>Just as she was finishing, the front door opened, and Sharon swept in like a much-needed gust of calm, dependable air. Her cheerful grin was like a reset button for Agatha’s frayed nerves.</p><p>“Hey, Sharon! Thanks so much for staying tonight,” Agatha said, standing to greet her. It wasn’t often Sharon did evenings but when she did, she had a bedroom that was hers and hers alone.</p><p>“Of course! You know I love these two munchkins,” Sharon replied, dropping her bag on the entryway table and ruffling Nicholas’s hair.</p><p>Nicholas beamed up at her. “Sharon! Will you read me the dinosaur book? Mama never says the names right!”</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha protested, hands on her hips. “That’s not true! I just have my own way of saying them.”</p><p>“Yeah, wrong,” Nicholas said with the blunt honesty only a five-year-old could pull off.</p><p>Sharon laughed, patting his shoulder. “Don’t worry, Nicky, I’ll try to get them right. Though some of those names are like tongue twisters for scientists.”</p><p>After a meal of spaghetti and meatballs for the children and Sharon, Agatha crouched down next to Nicholas, pulling him into a quick hug. “Be good for Sharon, okay? She’s in charge tonight.”</p><p>Nicholas frowned up at her. “Where are you going?”</p><p>“Just to dinner with a… friend,” Agatha said, choosing her words with the caution of a spy on a mission.</p><p>Nicholas narrowed his eyes suspiciously, like he was reading a hidden code in her expression. Then he shrugged, already distracted by his Lego creation.</p><p>Agatha stood, brushing invisible lint off her sweater as Sharon raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“Friend, huh?” she said with a knowing smirk.</p><p>“Don’t start,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“Have fun,” Sharon called after her. “And don’t worry—Nicholas and I will learn every single dinosaur name before you get back.”</p><p>Agatha groaned but couldn’t help laughing. “Great, just don’t teach him to correct me, or you’re on bedtime duty forever.”</p><p>"Storey had a good nap earlier, so she should go down easily after her bottle," Agatha said to Sharon, moving upstairs to start getting ready. "And if Nicholas begs for a second bedtime story, you can totally say no."</p><p>Sharon smirked. "Got it. Don’t worry about us—you just go and enjoy yourself."</p><p>Upstairs, Agatha stood in front of her full-length mirror, staring at the small collection of options she’d laid out on the bed. Tonight was a big deal—her first date with Rio—and it felt like everything she chose had to strike the perfect balance. Not too dressy, not too casual, but also something that screamed effortless elegance, even if she’d spent thirty minutes agonising over it. Her wardrobe was a mix of labels and mundane but with her position she did tend to dress to impress most of the time.</p><p>She finally decided on the dress: a patterned Dior dress that had cap sleeves, a dress that clung in all the right places without being too revealing. The fabric was luxurious blend, soft to the touch, the kind of dress she could only justify buying because it had been on sale—barely. The neckline dipped just enough to be flattering, with a fitted waist that flowed into a hemline hitting just above the knee. It was classic, elegant, and worth every agonizing penny she’d spent.</p><p>Next came the shoes. She reached for the nude Louboutins that had been sitting in her closet like a trophy for over a year, still practically new and almost too beautiful to wear. The iconic red soles caught the light as she slipped them on, adding an extra 3 inches to her height and an undeniable sense of confidence to her posture.</p><p>Accessories were minimal but deliberate: a pair of pearl drop earrings and a delicate gold bracelet that shimmered when it caught the light. Her clutch—a nude leather Yves Saint Laurent with a sleek gold chain—completed the ensemble, just large enough for her phone, lipstick, and a few essentials.</p><p>In front of the mirror, she gave herself a critical once-over. Her makeup was subtle but polished: a sweep of rosy blush, a flick of eyeliner, and her signature nude lipstick. Her hair, after an intense twenty-minute battle with a curling wand, now fell in soft waves over her shoulders.</p><p>Agatha turned from side to side, smoothing the dress and inspecting her reflection. She felt... good. Confident, even. The nerves were still there, fluttering in her chest, but they were balanced by the realisation that she looked—and felt—like the best version of herself.</p><p>“Well,” she murmured to her reflection, “if this doesn’t make an impression, I don’t know what will.”</p><p>At 6:50, Agatha stood outside Bistro Étoile, taking a steadying breath as the soft glow of the restaurant’s lanterns illuminated her face. She adjusted her coat, smoothing the front of her dress, the December air sharp against her skin. Despite the chill, she felt warm, anticipation humming through her.</p><p>The cozy hum of conversation and clinking glassware greeted her as she stepped inside. The restaurant’s intimate atmosphere was everything she’d hoped for—warm light from vintage sconces, small flickering candles on each table, and a low buzz that felt lively but not overwhelming.</p><p>Her eyes swept the room until they landed on Rio, seated at a table near the window.</p><p>Rio stood as soon as their eyes met, her smile lighting up her face. She wore a tailored black blazer over a crisp white blouse, her short dark hair perfectly styled. There was something effortlessly chic about her, but the look in her eyes, warm and focused, made Agatha feel like the only person in the room.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said as she approached, her voice rich and welcoming. “You look… wow.”</p><p>Agatha felt a blush creeping into her cheeks. “Hi,” she managed, smiling. “Thank you. You look great, too.”</p><p>Rio stepped around the table, pulling out a chair for her. “A blazer and blouse feels a bit boring next to you, though. That dress? Gorgeous.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly as she sat, shaking her head. “Trust me, this is smoke and mirrors. I spent more time choosing this dress than I did preparing for my entire last client meeting.”</p><p>“And it paid off,” Rio said smoothly, returning to her seat.</p><p>As they settled in, Agatha tried to quiet the butterflies in her stomach. It wasn’t just Rio’s appearance—it was the way she carried herself, poised yet approachable, with an energy that put her instantly at ease.</p><p>The waiter appeared, and they ordered drinks—Rose for Agatha, a gin and tonic with lime for Rio. After he left, Rio leaned back slightly, studying her. “I have to say, I didn’t expect to meet someone like you at that Christmas party. Colleague get togethers aren’t exactly my idea of a romantic setting.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, feeling the tension in her shoulders ease. “You and me both. I barely wanted to go, but Wanda would never have forgiven me.” She glanced at Rio, letting her voice trail off.</p><p>“And then,” Rio said, holding her gaze. “I wouldn’t have had the time pleasure of meeting you. I owe her, apparently.”</p><p>“I’m glad you did,” Agatha admitted, her voice soft.</p><p>Their drinks arrived, and they clinked glasses. “To unexpected meetings,” Rio said, her tone light but her eyes holding a deeper meaning.</p><p>“To unexpected meetings,” Agatha replied, smiling as she sipped her wine.</p><p>Conversation flowed effortlessly as they began to learn more about each other.</p><p>Agatha discovered that Rio’s career in pediatrics was as demanding as it was fulfilling. She spoke about her long hours with a mix of pride and self-deprecating humor, sharing stories of tricky diagnoses and moments of pure joy with her young patients.</p><p>“And after a day like that,” Rio said, swirling her drink, “I usually end up curled on the couch with a documentary on the TV or a good book. My social life isn’t exactly glamorous.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, intrigued. “What kind of books? Please don’t say medical journals.”</p><p>Rio laughed, her eyes crinkling. “No, definitely not. Mostly historical fiction, though I have a guilty weakness for thrillers. Anything that lets me unplug for a bit.”</p><p>“That’s more well-rounded than I expected from a doctor,” Agatha teased.</p><p>Rio smirked, leaning forward slightly. “We’re not all workaholics, you know. I’m more than just a stethoscope and caffeine addiction.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, feeling herself drawn into Rio’s easy charm. “Well, you hide it well. But I’ll admit, I’m impressed.”</p><p>“And you?” Rio asked, resting her chin in her hand. “What’s the secret behind the spreadsheets and power suits? What keeps you balanced?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, swirling her wine. “Balance is generous. It’s more like a constant juggling act. But when I can, I love cooking—something about chopping vegetables clears my head. And if I’m feeling ambitious, I’ll dust off my old sketchbook.”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows lifted. “A secret artist. I’m intrigued.”</p><p>“‘Artist’ is a stretch,” Agatha admitted. “But it’s nice to escape into something creative when I can.”</p><p>The conversation drifted into more personal territory as the evening went on, their laughter mingling with the warm buzz of the restaurant. Every so often, Rio would lean closer, her tone softening, her eyes lingering a moment longer than necessary.</p><p>“You’re not what I expected,” Rio said at one point, her voice low.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “What did you expect?”</p><p>Rio smiled, a touch of mischief in her expression. “Someone… a little more guarded. But you’re warm. Genuine. And you don’t hold back when you laugh—it’s refreshing that you’re the same here as you were at the cafe.”</p><p>Agatha felt her pulse quicken, but she held Rio’s gaze. “I could say the same about you. You’re… surprising.”</p><p>“Good surprising?” Rio asked, her smile growing.</p><p>“Very good,” Agatha replied, her voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>By the time dessert arrived—shared crème brûlée—they were both leaning comfortably across the table, their connection undeniable. Agatha couldn’t remember the last time she’d felt so present, so engaged.</p><p>As the evening wound down, the gentle hum of the restaurant seemed to fade into the background, leaving only Rio and Agatha in their own little world. The shared crème brûlée sat nearly forgotten between them, the conversation taking a more intimate turn.</p><p>When the waiter returned with the check, Rio reached for it without hesitation. "My treat," she said firmly, cutting off Agatha’s protest with a playful yet decisive look.</p><p>“You’ll have to let me return the favor next time,” Agatha said, a hopeful note in her voice.</p><p>“Next time, huh?” Rio’s smile widened, tongue pressed against the gap of her teeth as she signed the receipt. “I like the sound of that.”</p><p>They lingered at the table for a few more minutes, neither seeming in a hurry to break the moment. Eventually, though, they made their way outside, stepping into the cool night air. The city buzzed softly around them, the streets illuminated by streetlights.</p><p>Rio stopped just outside the restaurant, turning to face Agatha. Her eyes, dark and thoughtful, searched Agatha’s face as if committing every detail to memory.</p><p>“I had a great time tonight,” she said, her voice quieter now, almost vulnerable.</p><p>“Me too,” Agatha replied. She could feel the warmth rising in her cheeks, the flutter in her chest. “Really great.”</p><p>For a moment, neither of them moved, the air between them charged with something unspoken. Then, with a quiet resolve, Rio stepped closer.</p><p>“Is it okay if I…?” Rio trailed off, her gaze flicking between Agatha’s eyes and then lips.</p><p>Agatha nodded, her breath catching. “Yes.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, her hand brushing lightly against Agatha’s arm as their lips met. The kiss was soft and unhurried, a perfect balance of sweetness and promise. When they pulled back, Rio lingered, her forehead nearly resting against Agatha’s, soft breath hitting the lips she’d just been kissing.</p><p>“I’d really like to see you again,” Rio murmured, her voice barely audible over the distant hum of traffic. “If you’re interested.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, her heart racing as she looked into Rio’s eyes. “I’d like that. A lot.”</p><p>Rio’s grin was dazzling, the kind of smile that made it hard to look away. “Good,” she said simply. Then, stepping back, she took Agatha’s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze and pressing a kiss to the back of it before letting go. “Text me when you get home, okay?”</p><p>“I will,” Agatha promised, already anticipating their next meeting.</p><p>As Rio walked away, her silhouette illuminated by the streetlights, Agatha felt a warmth blooming in her chest. It wasn’t just the kiss or the laughter or the shared dessert. It was the feeling that something had definitely just begun.</p><p>When Agatha returned home just after 10pm, she found Sharon on the couch with Nicholas curled up beside her, fast asleep with his dinosaur book clutched to his chest.</p><p>Sharon smiled as Agatha slipped off her heels. "How’d it go?"</p><p>"Really good," Agatha admitted, a soft smile spreading across her face.</p><p>"Good," Sharon said with a knowing nod, standing to allow Agatha to pick Nicholas up. "You deserve that."</p><p>As Sharon settled for bed in her room and Agatha tiptoed upstairs to put Nicky to bed and to check on Storey, she felt a lightness she hadn’t in a long time. For the first time in ages, she found herself genuinely looking forward to what might come next.</p>

<p>The crisp winter air filled the car as Agatha drove through the familiar streets of her neighborhood. The low hum of the engine and the soft chatter of her son in the backseat, filled the otherwise quiet car. Storey, her youngest, was in the back as well, cradled in her car seat, her tiny face staring wide eyed out of the window. At just 11 months old, Storey was still discovering the world, and Agatha couldn’t help but smile at the sight of her little girl’s wide blue eyes as she stared out at the passing trees and homes.</p><p>The grey Range Rover glided smoothly along the road, making its way to the local Christmas tree farm. Nicholas asking excitedly about the tree they were going to pick out for this year.</p><p>“Mama, are we getting the biggest tree this time? I want a HUGE one!” he asked, bouncing in his seat with enthusiasm.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, glancing at him through the rearview mirror. “We’ll get a big one, Nicky. But we also want it to fit on the car. Let’s see what we find.”</p><p>“Okay! A BIG one!” Nicholas declared with an impish grin, his blue eyes sparkling.</p><p>Agatha smiled, her heart swelling with love for her children. Despite the high demands of her career, moments like these—simple, peaceful, and full of family joy—were what she cherished most. Weekends were a momentary escape from her usually packed schedule and she felt a rare sense of calm.</p><p>As they pulled into the tree farm, Agatha’s phone buzzed in the holder, drawing her attention away from the children’s excited chatter. She glanced down at the message from Rio. Her pulse quickened just a little as she read it.</p><p>Rio: Hey! Just wanted to check in about that next date. Let me know if you want to grab dinner when you’re free. Things have been so busy lately with work, but I’d love to see you before Christmas if we can make it work. :)”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help the smile that tugged at her lips. Rio’s messages always had a way of making her heart race. With Rio being a doctor, she had to deal with constantly juggling long shifts and unpredictable hours, and Agatha knew how tight her schedule must be. Still, she couldn’t help the excitement that bubbled up inside her at the thought of seeing Rio again.</p><p>She typed quickly, feeling a mixture of eagerness and hesitation.</p><p>Hi Rio! I’d love to see you before Christmas too. I know things must be crazy with your schedule, but let me know when you have a free evening. I’m flexible. :)”</p><p>Her fingers hovered over the phone for a moment as she considered adding more, but she decided to keep it light. Rio was always so busy, and Agatha didn’t want to overwhelm her.</p><p>After sending the message, she slipped the phone into her bag and focused back on the kids. Nicholas was already unbuckling his seatbelt, eager to get out of the car. “Are we getting a big tree, Mama? Can I pick it?”</p><p>“We’ll pick it together,” Agatha said with a smile, unbuckling Storey from her car seat as well. Storey gurgled softly in her seat, her hands reaching up as she babbled her baby language.</p><p>Nicholas, full of energy, rushed out of the car, and Agatha followed, gently lifting Storey into her arms. As they made their way toward the rows of trees, Nicholas was already darting from one to the next, inspecting them with the serious intent of a small boy who was determined to find the perfect one. Agatha watched him with a proud smile before she glanced down at her phone again.</p><p>There was a new message from Rio.</p><p>Rio: I’m free Wednesday evening for dinner if you’re available! Let me know if that works. I can’t wait to see you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped a beat. It was short notice, but she was thrilled at the thought of a date with Rio. Sharon would be able to stay with the kids, hopefully.</p><p>Rio had sparked something in her that she hadn’t felt in a long time. A desire for something more, something meaningful.</p><p>Agatha quickly typed a reply : Wednesday sounds perfect! Let’s do it. I’ll arrange and send you the details :)”</p><p>With that message sent, she felt a sense of relief. They would finally get to see each other before Christmas, and Agatha couldn’t help but feel excited about it. Rio was a whirlwind—so focused, so intelligent, and yet, she had this warmth about her that Agatha couldn’t resist. Even with her demanding job as a doctor, Rio had managed to make time for Agatha, something she truly appreciated.</p><p>“Okay, Nicky,” Agatha called, pulling herself away from her thoughts as she spotted her son crouching next to a large tree. “Let’s see if this one’s big enough!”</p><p>Nicholas turned, his face lighting up. “This one! It’s perfect!”</p><p>After inspecting the tree, Agatha agreed that it was just the right size. The kids were thrilled, and she couldn’t help but feel the magic of the season wrapping around them.</p><p>As they loaded the tree onto the car, Agatha’s thoughts returned to Rio. She wondered if this was the start of something real. She had always been careful, guarded even, especially when it came to relationships, but with Rio, things felt different. The way Rio made her laugh even just through texts, the way she looked at Agatha with such intensity when they went to dinner - it all felt so effortless.</p><p>At home the late afternoon sun cast a soft golden light through the expansive windows of Agatha’s open-plan living room. The scent of pine filled the air, a sweet, fresh fragrance that mingled with the faint smell of hot cocoa from the kitchen. Agatha stepped back, surveying the progress as Nicholas worked on the lower branches of the tree, his little hands carefully placing ornaments that were bright and shiny, yet slightly crooked. He was determined to make this year’s tree the best one ever.</p><p>"Mama, look! I think I got it!" Nicholas called, proudly holding up a glittering red ornament. It was one of his favorites—a playful reindeer with big, wide eyes. It had a slight tilt to it, leaning precariously to one side.</p><p>Agatha chuckled and walked over, gently adjusting it into a more balanced position.</p><p>“Looks perfect, sweetie. You’re really good at this,” she said with a smile, brushing his messy hair from his forehead. Nicholas beamed, pleased with the approval.</p><p>Storey was seated on the soft wool rug beneath the tree, her tiny fingers reaching for the lower branches. She babbled happily, tugging on the strings of lights, causing a few bulbs to blink erratically. Agatha laughed as she quickly crouched down beside her.</p><p>“Storey, my darling, let’s leave those lights alone, okay?” she said softly, taking her daughter’s hand away from the tangled wires. Storey giggled and pulled away, only to swipe at the dangling ornaments with even more determination. Agatha gently redirected her, offering her a soft, plush ornament to play with instead. “Here, this one is safe for you to hold.”</p><p>Storey grasped the soft, plush snowman ornament with both hands, smiling proudly as if she had just won a grand prize. Agatha couldn’t help but smile at the sight of her youngest child so content, her chubby cheeks flushed with excitement.</p><p>The sound of holiday music drifted from the speakers as Agatha stood up, stepping back to get a better view of the tree.</p><p>Nicholas had now moved on to the middle branches, placing ornaments on them with surprising care. Agatha knew that he was in his element—focused and determined, his mind entirely on the task. He had been looking forward to this moment all week, ever since Agatha had announced it was time to get a tree and decorate for Christmas.</p><p>“Let’s make it extra special this year, Mama,” he had said earlier that day, his eyes wide with anticipation. “I want the tree to be bigger and better than last year!”</p><p>Agatha smiled at the thought. The holidays were always a time of joy and excitement for her family. But this year, it was Storeys first Christmas making it feel even more magical—maybe it was the crisp winter air, or perhaps it was the fact that they were all together, settling into their cozy home as the world outside grew colder.</p><p>As Agatha busied herself arranging the ornaments on the higher branches, her phone buzzed again. It was a message from Rio. Her heart fluttered as she glanced at the screen, her thumb hovering for a moment before she tapped the message open.</p><p>Rio: Can’t stop thinking about our dinner on Wednesday. Hope you’re as excited as I am. 😊</p><p>Agatha smiled to herself, her heart skipping a beat. Rio’s words always made her feel like she was floating on air.</p><p>She quickly typed a reply: I’m definitely excited. Can’t wait to see you.</p><p>After sending the message, Agatha returned to the tree, watching as Nicholas carefully adjusted another ornament. He had a look of pure concentration on his face as he placed a silver star on the highest point he could reach. Agatha’s heart swelled with love for her children as she watched him, so proud of his accomplishment.</p><p>“You did it!” Agatha exclaimed, crouching beside him as he stepped back to admire his work.</p><p>“It’s the best tree ever, right?” Nicholas said, his eyes shining with joy.</p><p>“It’s perfect,” Agatha agreed, kissing the top of his head.</p><p>With the tree now adorned with twinkling lights, colorful ornaments, and glittering tinsel, Agatha felt a wave of satisfaction. It was more than just the tree—it was the memories they were creating together. The laughter, the excitement, the shared joy of something as simple as decorating a Christmas tree.</p><p>Storey, who had been content with her snowman ornament, was now crawling toward the lower branches, attempting to touch the sparkling lights once again. Agatha couldn’t resist the smile that tugged at her lips as she picked her daughter up, cradling her in her arms.</p><p>“Not quite yet,” she said gently, holding Storey close as they moved back to the couch, where Nicholas had already jumped up to sit with a small plate of cookies. “You’ll have to wait until next year to help decorate, okay?”</p><p>Storey giggled, reaching for her cookies with a look of curiosity in her eyes. Agatha handed her a small piece, and she happily gnawed on it, her chubby fingers sticky with icing.</p><p>“Mom, can I sit by the tree tonight?” Nicholas asked suddenly, his voice full of excitement. “Like, to watch the lights blink?”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha replied. “We can all sit together by the tree after dinner.”</p><p>As the evening wore on, the tree seemed to glow even brighter in the soft, golden light of the living room. Agatha sat back, mesmerized by the twinkling lights reflecting off the glass ornaments and tinsel. The room carried a warm hum of contentment, her heart full from the day’s memories—the children’s excited laughter as they hung ornaments, the scent of cinnamon and pine filling the air, and the cozy chaos of the holiday season in full swing.</p><p>Nestled on the couch, her daughter Storey was perched on her lap, playing idly with the hem of Agatha’s sweater, while Nicholas was tucked under her arm, his head resting sleepily against her shoulder. The three of them made a perfect tableau of comfort and love, and as Agatha gazed down at her kids, she felt a profound sense of gratitude for these quiet, fleeting moments of togetherness. Yet, beneath that warmth, something new stirred within her—a spark of excitement, a flicker of possibility.</p><p>Her thoughts drifted to Rio. The mere thought of her brought a soft smile to Agatha’s lips, and before she could second-guess herself, she picked up her phone. She began typing a message to finalize their plans for the week. Her fingers hesitated for just a second before hitting send.</p><p>Agatha:Is 7 p.m. Wednesday okay?</p><p>She held her breath as the message delivered, anticipation curling in her chest. The reply came almost instantly, making her pulse quicken.</p><p>Rio:Perfect! Send me the details and I’ll meet you there.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, a smile spreading across her face as relief and excitement mingled together. Setting her phone down, she leaned back against the cushions, her gaze drifting back to the twinkling tree. She felt Storey shift in her lap and Nicholas sigh contentedly beside her. This was her life—her children, her home, her haven. Yet now, for the first time in a long while, there was something more. Something budding and delicate, a fresh hope stirring with the promise of what could lie ahead.</p><p>The holiday season had always been about family for her, but now it was about something else, too—new beginnings, unexpected connections, and the quiet joy of allowing herself to dream of more.</p><p>Later that night, after the kids had been tucked into bed, the house had settled into a serene silence. Agatha sat alone in the living room, a glass of wine in hand as she admired the tree. The glow of the lights painted the room in soft, warm hues, and she felt at peace. Her phone buzzed on the coffee table, drawing her attention. She reached for it, her breath catching when she saw Rio’s name light up the screen.</p><p>Rio: I know I’ve already said this, but I’m really looking forward to Wednesday. Let’s make it an unforgettable evening. Can’t wait to see you. 😘</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped at the playful emoji. She felt a warmth spread through her, accompanied by a thrill she hadn’t felt in years. Her fingers danced across the keyboard as she replied, her smile widening with every tap.</p><p>Agatha: Me too, Rio. I can’t wait.</p><p>Setting her phone back down, Agatha leaned deeper into the couch, her thoughts swirling with anticipation. The idea of seeing Rio again so soon filled her with equal parts excitement and nervousness. She wanted the evening to be perfect—something they’d both remember fondly. Her mind began to wander, piecing together the details of the night.</p><p>Would they go somewhere cozy and intimate, or something a little more adventurous? Should she book a reservation, or find a place where the evening could unfold naturally? Agatha sipped her wine as she mulled over the options, each one feeling like a piece of the larger puzzle she was trying to assemble.</p><p>And then there was the question of a gift. Christmas was just around the corner, and they likely wouldn’t see each other again before the holiday. Should she bring something small—something thoughtful yet not overwhelming? Or would that seem like too much, too soon? Agatha chewed on her lip, caught in the delicate balance of wanting to show Rio how much she cared without overstepping.</p><p>The thought of giving Rio a gift tugged at her heart. She wanted to show her appreciation, her excitement for this budding connection. But what would be right? A book that reminded her of their first conversation? A handwritten card with something sweet and simple? Or maybe something as effortless as a bouquet of flowers, cheerful and festive?</p><p>She glanced at her phone again, tempted to reach out for advice but stopping herself. No, she wanted this to come from her heart, not the influence of others. As the lights on the tree flickered, she decided she’d trust her instincts. After all, this was about sincerity and connection, not perfection.</p><p>The rest of the evening slipped away as Agatha made plans for Wednesday, her heart light with the promise of what was to come. The holidays had always been her favorite time of year, but this year felt different. It wasn’t just about traditions and family anymore—it was about rediscovery, possibility, and the quiet, beautiful joy of opening herself up to something new.</p>

<p>Agatha stood in front of her full-length mirror, adjusting the delicate necklace resting just above the neckline of her deep emerald-green dress. The fabric hugged her figure in all the right places—elegant but not too formal, with long sleeves that offered warmth against the winter chill. She had spent more time than she’d like to admit deciding on this outfit, but something about tonight felt different. It had been so long since she had been this excited for a date, all she could think about was the kiss they had shared at the end of the last one.</p><p>On the dresser beside her, a small box sat wrapped in matte cream paper, tied with a thin red ribbon. Inside was her gift for Rio—a first-edition copy of The Martian. Their conversation about the the film had stuck with Agatha, the way Rio’s face had lit up as she spoke about the story, how she had confessed it was one of her favorites. Agatha had searched tirelessly for the perfect paper copy, something meaningful but not overwhelming or extravagant.</p><p>She picked up the box, tucking it into the pocket of her dark wool coat before heading downstairs.</p><p>Sharon was already there, laughing as Nicholas excitedly explained their Christmas plans. Storey was babbling along, nodding her little head and clapping her chubby hands together as she perched on Sharons lap as though to fully agree</p><p>"You look beautiful," Sharon commented, giving Agatha a knowing smile. "Big night?"</p><p>Agatha felt warmth creep up her neck. "Just dinner."</p><p>"Mmm-hmm," Sharon teased. "Just dinner."</p><p>Nicholas looked up from his conversation. "Mama, can we have extra cookies if we're good while you're gone?"</p><p>Agatha laughed. "Nice try, but no extra cookies. Normal cookie amount only."</p><p>Nicholas groaned dramatically, while Storey giggled. Agatha bent down, kissing both of them on their heads. "Be good for Sharon, okay?"</p><p>Nicholas sighed. "Okay, okay. Have fun on your date."</p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted in surprise, how did he know it was a date, but before she could respond, Sharon just chuckled. "Go on, we’ve got this."</p><p>Taking a steadying breath, Agatha stepped out into the crisp winter night.</p><p>The restaurant was just as warm and inviting as Agatha remembered— a small French bistro tucked away on a quiet street. Inside, candlelight flickered on dark wood tables, and the scent of garlic and butter filled the air. Soft jazz played in the background, adding to the intimate atmosphere.</p><p>She had just been led to their table near the window, removing her coat, when a familiar voice made her turn.</p><p>"Wow," Rio said from the entrance, pausing for just a second as her dark eyes swept over Agatha. "You look… absolutely stunning."</p><p>Agatha felt warmth spread through her chest.</p><p>"You’re dont look so bad yourself," she teased, taking in the way Rio had effortlessly pulled off a navy blazer over a fitted black top. The sharp lines of the blazer contrasted with the softness in Rio’s gaze as she smiled.</p><p>Rio stepped forward, her expression playful but sincere. "If I’d known you were going to look this good, I would’ve made a bigger effort."</p><p>Agatha laughed. "Oh, please. You could show up in scrubs, and you'd still look better than half the people in this place."</p><p>Rio smirked as they settled into their seats, leaning back slightly. "That might be the best compliment I’ve ever received."</p><p>Their conversation flowed as easily as ever, filled with teasing and laughter, but also something deeper—those quiet moments where their eyes lingered a little longer, where words seemed to carry more weight.</p><p>"So, tell me," Rio said as their wine arrived, swirling her glass lightly. "How’s Christmas shaping up with the kids?"</p><p>Agatha smiled, thinking about the chaotic yet perfect way their living room had transformed into a winter wonderland. "Nicholas is on a mission to make this our best Christmas ever. Storey, meanwhile, is on a mission to destroy every ornament within her reach."</p><p>Rio laughed, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "That sounds fun. Controlled chaos?"</p><p>"More like delightful destruction," Agatha corrected. "But I wouldn't have it any other way."</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened. "You’re such a great mom, Agatha."</p><p>Agatha felt her breath hitch slightly. Compliments about her career, her work ethic—those she could brush off easily. But this? This felt different. More personal.</p><p>"Thank you," she said, her voice quieter now.</p><p>Rio smiled, taking a sip of her wine before setting the glass down. "Do you give yourself time off for the holidays?"</p><p>"A little," Agatha admitted. "I try to keep Christmas time as free as possible for the kids. What about you?"</p><p>Rio sighed. "Not much, unfortunately. The hospital's always crazy this time of year. But I did manage to get Christmas Eve off, so I’ll spend it with my friends, we usually do something together."</p><p>Agatha nodded, then hesitated before reaching into her coat pocket. "Speaking of Christmas…" She placed the small, wrapped box on the table, sliding it toward Rio. "I got you something."</p><p>Rio blinked in surprise. "Agatha, you didn’t have to do that."</p><p>"I wanted to," Agatha said simply, watching as Rio hesitated for only a second before untying the ribbon.</p><p>When she lifted the lid and saw the book inside, her lips parted slightly. Her fingers traced the embossed lettering, her expression shifting into something softer.</p><p>"You got me the martian?" Her voice was quiet, almost disbelieving. "This is a signed   first edition."</p><p>Agatha nodded. "I remembered you said it was one of your favourite films. I thought you might like to have a special copy of the book."</p><p>Rio stared at the book for a long moment before looking up at Agatha, something unspoken passing between them.</p><p>"This is…" Rio exhaled, shaking her head slightly. "Agatha, no one's ever given me something like this before on a date."</p><p>Agatha felt a warmth spread through her, her heart picking up pace. "I just wanted to give you something meaningful."</p><p>Rio was silent for a moment before she reached across the table, her fingers brushing over Agatha’s before finally taking her hand.</p><p>"I think," Rio murmured, her thumb tracing soft circles against Agatha’s skin, "this might be one of the best Christmas gifts I’ve ever received."</p><p>Agatha swallowed, feeling her pulse quicken. The restaurant, the low hum of conversation around them—it all faded into the background. All she could focus on was the way Rio was looking at her.</p><p>They lingered once again over dessert, neither of them in any hurry to leave. The conversation grew quieter, more intimate, the space between them closing with each passing moment. And when they finally stepped outside into the crisp winter air, Rio turned to Agatha with a soft smile, her breath visible in the cold.</p><p>"This was perfect," she murmured.</p><p>Agatha, feeling bold, reached for Rio’s hand again, lacing their fingers together.</p><p>"It really was," she agreed softly.</p><p>As they stepped out of the restaurant, the crisp night air wrapped around them, carrying the faint scent of pine and woodsmoke. The city had taken on a magical quality—the streets glowed with holiday lights.</p><p>Agatha had half-expected the night to end here, a polite goodbye, maybe even another chaste kiss. But neither of them made a move to part ways. Instead, Rio squeezed her hand lightly and tilted her head toward the quiet street ahead.</p><p>"Feel like walking for a bit?"</p><p>Agatha smiled. "Yeah. I’d like that."</p><p>They walked in comfortable silence for a few moments, their footsteps in sync against the damp pavement. Agatha glanced sideways at Rio, who had one hand in the pocket of her coat, the other still wrapped around Agatha’s fingers.</p><p>"You know," Agatha said, "I feel like I know lots about the professional version of you—the incredibly skilled, dedicated surgeon. But outside of work… what makes Rio, Rio?"</p><p>Rio chuckled, glancing at Agatha with an amused expression. "Outside of work, huh? That’s dangerous territory. You might realize I’m actually pretty boring."</p><p>"I doubt that," Agatha said, nudging her playfully. "Come on, tell me something I don’t know."</p><p>Rio sighed dramatically, as if it were a difficult request, but a small smile tugged at her lips. "Alright. Outside of being a surgeon, I have a not so secret second love, plants."</p><p>"Plants?" Agatha repeated, intrigued.</p><p>"Mhm." Rio nodded, her expression softening. "I love gardening. I have a little greenhouse behind my house—roses, herbs, succulents, you name it. It’s my escape when things get too hectic at work."</p><p>Agatha slowed her steps slightly, turning toward Rio with curiosity. "I never would’ve guessed that. A surgeon with a green thumb?"</p><p>Rio laughed. "It sounds weird, right? I think it started as a way to have control over something in a world that often feels… uncontrollable. Surgery is precise, calculated. But gardening—gardening is about patience. You can’t rush it, you can’t control it completely. You just nurture and wait."</p><p>Agatha let those words settle between them, feeling an unexpected warmth in her chest. "That’s beautiful, actually."</p><p>Rio shrugged, suddenly looking a little shy. "It’s just something that makes me happy. Keeps me grounded, you know?"</p><p>"I get it," Agatha said softly. "I feel the same way about reading. Books were my escape when I was younger. Still are, in a lot of ways."</p><p>Rio nodded. "That makes sense. I can totally see you as a book nerd."</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then asked, "Do you ever let people see your greenhouse?"</p><p>Rio smirked. "Are you asking for an invitation?"</p><p>Agatha lifted a shoulder. "Maybe."</p><p>They stopped at the edge of a small park, the path lined with bare trees wrapped in white lights. Rio turned to face her fully now, her dark eyes searching Agatha’s face.</p><p>"I don’t usually let people into that space," Rio admitted. "But, I think I can make an exception for you."</p><p>Agatha felt her heart flutter at the quiet sincerity in Rio’s voice.</p><p>"I’d love that," she murmured.</p><p>Rio studied her for a moment longer before giving her hand another gentle squeeze. "Then it’s a date."</p><p>Agatha smiled. "Another one?"</p><p>Rio grinned. "Yeah. I like spending time with you."</p><p>Agatha felt a warmth spread through her despite the cold. "Good. Because I like spending time with you too."</p><p>They stood there for a moment, the world around them quiet and still. Then, with a shared, unspoken understanding, they continued walking—hand in hand, beneath the glow of the city lights.</p><p>Agatha had insisted on driving Rio home after their walk. Her Range Rover’s engine hummed softly as Agatha guided it down the quiet streets, the city lights casting flickering patterns against the windshield. Inside the car, warmth cocooned them, contrasting the winter chill just beyond the glass.</p><p>Rio sat in the passenger seat, one hand resting lazily on Agathas thigh (a move that had caused a deep blush in the other woman) while the other toyed absentmindedly with the hem of her coat. There was an energy between them now, something neither of them had spoken aloud but both felt humming in the silence.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio from the corner of her eye. The dim glow of passing streetlights illuminated the curve of her jaw, the gentle slope of her nose, the softness of her lips.</p><p>"I had a really great time tonight," Agatha murmured, her voice quiet but full of meaning.</p><p>Rio turned her head slightly, watching her with dark, unreadable eyes. "Yeah?" she said, her tone teasing but laced with something deeper.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a small laugh, shaking her head. "Yeah."</p><p>They reached a red light, and Agatha shifted in her seat, drumming her fingers lightly against the steering wheel.</p><p>Rio watched her for a beat longer before she leaned in, her voice a near whisper. "Pull over."</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. "What?"</p><p>Rio’s lips twitched. "You heard me."</p><p>Agatha hesitated for only a second before she flicked on her turn signal, steering the car onto a quiet, dimly lit side street, what had gone wrong, had Rio changed her mind about whatever this was. As soon as she shifted into park, Rio was unbuckling her seatbelt, turning toward her with a look that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>"You keep looking at me like that," Rio murmured, "I cant think of anything but doing this."</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her fingers tightening on the steering wheel. "Doing what?”</p><p>Rio reached out, her fingers tracing a slow, deliberate path along Agatha’s jaw before tilting her face slightly. "This," she whispered.</p><p>She surged forward, their mouths meeting in a kiss that was anything but tentative. Agatha responded immediately, her lips parting against Rios, her hands sliding into Rios hair and pulling her in closer, deeper.</p><p>Agatha groaned softly, her fingers gripping the collar of Rio’s coat as she twisted in her seat, desperate to be nearer. The kiss was slow at first, a teasing exploration, but it quickly spiraled into something more urgent—tongues meeting, breaths mingling, hands wandering.</p><p>Rio tasted like red wine and something distinctly her, something intoxicating. Agatha tilted her head, deepening the kiss as Rio let out a quiet, breathy sigh against her mouth. The sound sent heat pooling low in Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>Rio shifted, pressing closer, one hand sliding down Agatha’s arm before gripping her thigh again, squeezing just enough to make Agatha inhale sharply. She pulled back just a fraction, their lips barely apart, their breaths mingling in the charged air.</p><p>"God," Agatha murmured, her forehead resting against Rio’s. "You’re"</p><p>"Yeah?" Rio smirked, her voice a little breathless.</p><p>Agatha huffed a soft laugh, shaking her head as she kissed her again, this time slower, savoring the way Rio’s lips moved against hers.</p><p>Minutes passed, time becoming a blur of warmth and quiet sighs, of hands mapping over coats and fingers tangled in hair. The windows fogged up, their breath painting ghostly patterns against the glass.</p><p>Finally, Agatha pulled away, her pulse hammering, her lips tingling. Rio’s eyes were dark, lidded, her expression unreadable but undeniably pleased.</p><p>"Should I even bother driving you home?" Agatha murmured, her voice low.</p><p>Rio laughed, a husky sound that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. "As much as I’d love to keep doing this all night… I have surgery at six a.m."</p><p>Agatha groaned, dropping her head back against the headrest. "That’s cruel."</p><p>Rio grinned, leaning in to press one last, lingering kiss to Agatha’s lips. "I’ll make it up to you," she promised softly.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a shaky breath before putting the car back in drive, a smirk tugging at her lips. "You better."</p><p>And as she pulled back onto the road, Rio’s fingers slid over hers on the gear shift, interlacing their hands, a silent promise lingering between them.</p><p>Agatha walked Rio to her front door, another passionate kiss was shared before she reluctantly tore away from Rio, giving a bashful smile as she untangled Rios hand from where it was wrapped over the curve of her waist. As she walked back to her car, she couldnt stop the smile on her face if she tried.</p><p>Agatha pulled into her driveway, exhaling as she turned off the engine. The house was quiet, the glow of the Christmas tree visible through the large front window. She sat there for a moment, her fingers still resting on the wheel, her lips still tingling from Rio’s kiss.</p><p>She hadn’t expected the night to go like that—to unravel so naturally, so effortlessly. Rio had a way of making her feel things that she hadn’t ever felt before.</p><p>Finally, she stepped out of the car, careful to close the door quietly as she made her way up the front steps. Unlocking the door, she pushed it open and was immediately wrapped in the warmth of home—the faint scent of pine and cinnamon lingering in the air from their christmas decorations.</p><p>The house was still. Sharon was staying the night again, but Agatha didn’t hear a sound. She peeked into Nicholas room first—Nicholas was curled up on his side under a throw blanket, one arm wrapped around a stuffed bear. A small smile touched Agatha’s lips.</p><p>Then, she checked on Storey, who was tucked safely in her crib, her little hands balled into fists near her face, her chest rising and falling in a steady rhythm.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. Everything was exactly as it should be.</p><p>She moved down the hall, pausing at Sharon’s door and peeking in. Her longtime friend and nanny was fast asleep, curled up with her own blanket pulled over her shoulder. Agatha would have to thank her in the morning.</p><p>She made her way to her bedroom, finally allowing herself to sink into the cool sheets, the night replaying in her mind.</p><p>Her phone buzzed on the nightstand.</p><p>Rio: Can’t stop thinking about you. Sleep well, Agatha.</p><p>Agatha smiled, her heart flipping in her chest. She hesitated for only a moment before replying.</p><p>Agatha: I can’t stop thinking about you either. Sweet dreams, Rio.</p><p>She stared at the screen for a moment longer, then placed the phone down with a quiet exhale, settling back against the pillows.</p><p>Outside, the world was still. But inside, something new had begun.</p>

<p>Agatha woke to the soft glow of December morning light filtering through the curtains, the house still quiet except for the faint hum of the heating system kicking in. The warmth of her silk sheets cocooned her, the subtle scent of lavender lingering from last night’s bath. A sleepy smile tugged at her lips as she turned over, sinking deeper into the plush mattress.  Remnants of her dreams still hazy in her mind, dreams of Rio and their last date.</p><p>They hadn’t had chance to see each other since in the run up to Christmas day but had kept in contact through calls and texts.</p><p>Thinking of Christmas, as if on cue, she heard the patter of little feet against the hardwood floor.</p><p>The bedroom door creaked open, and a small voice whispered, “Mama?”</p><p>Agatha cracked one eye open, her heart swelling at the sight of Nicholas standing in the doorway. His long hair had fallen out if his nighttime bun and hung in an unruly mess around his face, his tiny frame swallowed by the plaid Christmas pajamas she had picked out for each of them. In his arms, he clutched one of the many stuffed animals he never slept without—this one a deep green triceratops with worn fabric from being hugged too many times.</p><p>“Merry Christmas, baby,” she murmured, sitting up and holding out her arms.</p><p>Nicholas wasted no time climbing onto the bed, his little limbs wrapping around her like a koala. “Is it time yet? Has Santa been?” he asked, his voice still thick with sleep.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “I’m sure he has. Let’s go wake up your sister, okay?”</p><p>Nicholas nodded excitedly, his blue eyes sparkling with anticipation. Hand in hand, they padded down the hall to Storey’s nursery. The room was softly illuminated by the glow of a nightlight, shapes of animals cast against the darkened walls, the curtains blocking out all of the natural light.</p><p>Inside her crib, Storey was still deep in sleep, her tiny body curled up and clad in a matching pair of pyjamas to each family member, her rosebud lips slightly parted. Oblivious to what today would hold.</p><p>“Storey, sweetheart,” Agatha whispered, smoothing a gentle hand over her daughter’s soft dark curls. Storey stirred, letting out a tiny sigh before blinking up at her mother with big, sleepy eyes.</p><p>“Merry Christmas, baby girl,” Agatha cooed, lifting Storey into her arms. She pressed a kiss to her daughter’s chubby cheek, breathing in her soft baby scent—a mix of baby lotion and warmth. The baby gurgled in response, her tiny fingers curling one into the Agatha’s pajama top and the other into her hair as she laid her head against her mother’s shoulder, sleep already reclaiming her.</p><p>By the time they made it downstairs, the house was alive with the scent of fresh coffee. The living room was a picture of holiday magic. The christmas tree twinkled with thousands of tiny fairy lights, the odd angle of some of the decorations a testament to Storeys fascination with them. Beneath it, an abundance of meticulously wrapped presents waited, their ribbons tied in perfect bows. A fire crackled already in the grand fireplace, filling the space with warmth.</p><p>Sharon was up, seated on the couch with a warm mug of coffee in her hands. She looked cozy in her matching pajamas, her blonde hair pulled into a loose bun. A plush green cashmere throw was draped over her lap—a gift from Agatha last Christmas.</p><p>“Good morning, you three,” she greeted with a warm smile. “Merry Christmas.”</p><p>Nicholas all but launched himself at Sharon, snuggling up beside her. “Merry Christmas, Sharon. Look at the presents!!”</p><p>Storey, still fighting the pull of sleep, let out a little yawn, rubbing her tiny fists over her eyes before resting her head back against Agatha’s shoulder. Agatha pointedly ignored the trail of saliva she was leaving there—it was just part of having a a young child.</p><p>Nicholas bounced excitedly on the couch. “Can we open presents now?”</p><p>Agatha laughed, kneeling near the tree, settling Storey against her. “Go ahead, sweetheart. This one’s for you.”</p><p>Nicholas ripped into his first present with enthusiasm, his little hands tearing through the wrapping paper with pure delight. His eyes went wide as he pulled out a limited-edition toy truck—a handcrafted, custom-designed replica of a vintage model, with his name engraved on the side.</p><p>“Whoa! Mama, look!”</p><p>Agatha beamed, watching as Sharon handed Storey a small plush reindeer made of the softest alpaca wool. The baby immediately stuffed it into her mouth, gnawing happily.</p><p>One by one, they unwrapped gifts. Nicholas shrieked with excitement at the sight of a brand-new electric race car set, a collection of rare dinosaur figurines, and a sleek new tablet loaded with educational games. Storey, meanwhile, was fascinated by the crinkling paper, more interested in playing with the ribbons than the presents themselves.</p><p>Sharon unwrapped her gifts with amused delight—another luxurious knit throw, a set of handcrafted candles, a designer handbag she had been eyeing for months but never bought for herself and admonished Agatha for purchasing for her.</p><p>Then, she turned to Agatha, holding out a small box wrapped in delicate gold paper. “This one’s for you,” she said softly.</p><p>Agatha blinked, surprised. “Sharon, you didn’t have to—”</p><p>“Oh, hush. Just open it.”</p><p>Inside the box was a delicate silver bracelet, engraved with the names “Nicholas” and “Storey” in the inside in elegant cursive. Agatha swallowed the sudden lump in her throat, her fingers tracing over the engraving.</p><p>“It’s beautiful,” she whispered, voice thick with emotion, she hadn’t expected any gifts outside of the token gifts from her business associates, even though Sharon always surprised her.</p><p>Sharon patted her hand. “You deserve something special too, Agatha. You do so much for everyone else.”</p><p>Agatha looked up, her heart full. “Thank you, Sharon. For everything.”</p><p>Sharon gave her a knowing smile. “That’s what family is for.”</p><p>As Nicholas played with his new toys and Storey babbled happily in the background, Agatha’s phone buzzed. She glanced at the screen, and warmth bloomed in her chest.</p><p>Rio: Merry Christmas, beautiful. I hope Santa brought you everything you wished for.</p><p>Agatha smiled, quickly typing back.</p><p>Agatha: Merry Christmas, Rio. I’m very happy with my gift❤️ Hope you’ve been spoiled today and your shift isn’t too stressful.</p><p>The morning continued in a flurry of wrapping paper and laughter. Agatha had left the children to play in the chaos to prepare an elaborate breakfast spread—fluffy Belgian waffles, fresh fruit, and a steaming pot of imported hot chocolate topped with handmade marshmallows which they ate on the floor beside the mess.</p><p>Agatha reached under the tree for one last gift—a small envelope with Sharon’s name written in elegant script.</p><p>Sharon arched an eyebrow. “Agatha, what did you do?”</p><p>Agatha just smirked. “Open it and find out.”</p><p>Sharon carefully peeled back the seal, pulling out a sleek brochure. Her eyes widened. “A… spa retreat? For a week?”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “A full week of massages, facials, relaxation—no wrangling kids, no no organised chaos, no cleaning up my children’s mess. Just you, being pampered at a gorgeous resort.”</p><p>Sharon’s lips parted. “Agatha, this is, this is too much.”</p><p>“It’s exactly what you need,” Agatha countered gently. “You deserve it. You’ve done so much for us. Let me do this for you.”</p><p>For the first time, Sharon looked genuinely speechless. Agatha was always good to her, paying her above the odds for taking care of her children and including her as though she really was family, case in point she was here on Christmas day with matching pyjamas as Agatha ran around after her and the kids. She didn’t have anyone after the passing of her husband, these three really were her family now. With a watery laugh, she pulled Agatha into a tight hug. “You are entirely too good to me,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha squeezed her back. “I love you, Sharon. You’re part of our family.”</p><p>As the morning unfolded into early afternoon, the living room became a cozy mess of half-opened gift boxes, and the laughter of two children utterly lost in the magic of Christmas. Nicholas had taken to racing his new toy cars across the gleaming hardwood floors, and Storey, content with the plush reindeer, had fallen asleep nestled against Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Sharon, curled up on the couch with her second cup of coffee, let out a satisfied sigh. “I think this might be our best Christmas yet.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, brushing her lips over the top of Storey’s soft curls. “It does feel special this year.” But as the words left her mouth, her mind drifted to Rio.</p><p>She hadn’t seen her since their dinner last week. It was all so new, so uncertain, yet Agatha couldn’t deny the warmth that settled deep in her chest whenever Rio’s name crossed her mind.</p><p>And now, on Christmas Day, while Agatha sat in the glow of her family’s laughter, Rio was at the hospital, working a long shift,  likely spending her day patching up holiday mishaps and comforting patients who had no one else to turn to.</p><p>She deserved better.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers itched to text her again, to tell her to take a break, to ask if she had eaten, if she had stolen even a sliver of joy for herself today. Agatha wished she were here with them.</p><p>With a soft sigh, she kissed Storey’s head once more and gently passed her to Sharon. “I should start on dinner.”</p><p>Sharon arched an eyebrow. “You know some people wouldn’t believe how much of the cooking you do yourself, they probably think you have a personal chef?”</p><p>Agatha smirked as she stood, stretching. “What’s the fun in that?”</p><p>She had planned everything meticulously—a feast fit for royalty. Though she did have a personal chef that did cook when work got a little too hectic she preferred to cook for her family herself. The only person that was a constant in terms of help was Sharon and she didn’t really count as she was more like a grandmother to the kids than their nanny.</p><p>Christmas dinner was one thing Agatha insisted on always making herself. It was a tradition. The kitchen was already stocked with the finest ingredients. A beautifully marbled prime rib sat waiting, along with fresh seafood. Aged wine from her private collection stood ready for the evening.</p><p>As she set to work, the kitchen filled with the comforting symphony of clinking utensils, the gentle hum of the oven, and the rich aroma of garlic and rosemary as they sizzled in butter. She moved effortlessly, searing, chopping, stirring, a rhythm she found calming.</p><p>Sharon wandered in, glass of wine now in hand. “I don’t know why I’m surprised every year, but this smells and looks amazing.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “I like cooking.”</p><p>“You like control,” Sharon teased, leaning against the counter.</p><p>“Same thing.”</p><p>Sharon laughed, then eyed her thoughtfully. “You’ve quiet. Thinking about Rio?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, but there was no point in denying it. “Yeah.”</p><p>“Have you talked to her today?”</p><p>“She texted this morning, but she’s working.” Agatha stirred the sauce simmering on the stove, exhaling. “I just feel bad. She’s spending Christmas at the hospital while I’m here, making a ridiculous amount of food for four of us.”</p><p>“She knew what she was signing up for when she chose that profession,” Sharon said gently.</p><p>“I know.” Agatha paused, her grip tightening slightly on the spoon. “I just wish she had something special waiting for her when she gets off her shift.”</p><p>Sharon tilted her head, a slow smile spreading across her lips. “Then do something about it.”</p><p>Agatha turned to her, considering.</p><p>And just like that, an idea began to form.</p><p>By the time dinner was ready, the dining table was set in elegant perfection. The table was adorned with fine china, delicate crystal glasses, and a centerpiece of fresh red and white roses intertwined with golden holly leaves. Candlelight flickered warmly, casting a glow over the rich dishes laid out before them—a perfectly roasted prime rib, buttery lobster tails, creamy mashed potatoes, roasted Brussels sprouts with pancetta, and a decadent truffle mac and cheese that Nicholas had already declared “the best thing ever.”</p><p>Nicholas bounced in his seat, eyes wide as he took in the spread. “Mama! This looks like a feast in a castle!”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, ruffling his hair. “Only the best for my prince and princess.”</p><p>Storey, seated in her high chair, clapped her tiny hands together, giggling at the shimmering candle flames that were pushed well back and out of her reach. Sharon raised her glass. “To another wonderful Christmas. And to you, Agatha, for making it perfect.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her own glass with a smile, but her thoughts were still half elsewhere.</p><p>Later that night, after the food had been devoured, after Nicholas had collapsed in a pile of blankets and toys, and Storey had been tucked into her crib, Agatha finally pulled out her phone.</p><p>She stared at the screen for a moment, then typed a message.</p><p>Agatha: Still working?</p><p>It took a few minutes before Rio responded.</p><p>Rio: Still here. Christmas in the ER is chaotic. Just finished stitching up a kid who thought climbing a Christmas tree was a good idea.*</p><p>Agatha smiled softly.</p><p>Agatha: Sounds eventful. Any chance you’ll be home soon?</p><p>A pause. Then—</p><p>Rio: Maybe in an hour or so. Why?</p><p>Agatha hesitated for only a second before pressing send.</p><p>Agatha: Just you’ve had a long day. Merry Christmas, Dr. Vidal</p><p>Rio: I cant wait to go home and crash tbh</p><p>Agatha: I don’t blame you. Speak to  you soon?</p><p>Rio: Yeah. Speak to you soon, beautiful.</p><p>And with that, Agatha slipped on her coat and grabbed the keys to her car.</p><p>She had a surprise to deliver.</p><p>Rio exhaled tiredly as she approached her front door. The shift had been brutal. Christmas in the ER was always unpredictable—some cases were heartwarming, others downright heartbreaking. And though she loved her job, exhaustion settled deep in her bones tonight.</p><p>The porch was dark except for the faint glow from her Christmas tree from the window. She had barely managed to decorate it earlier in the month, throwing on a few twinkling lights and some mismatched ornaments she had collected over the years.</p><p>But then, something caught her eye.</p><p>Sitting just outside her door, tucked by her planter, was a neatly wrapped plate of food, covered with foil, with a small note placed on top:</p><p>Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Thought you could use a real meal. Hope this makes up for the madness of your day. - A</p><p>Rio blinked, her heart clenching unexpectedly.</p><p>Carefully, she pulled back the foil to reveal a beautifully plated Christmas dinner—perfectly roasted prime rib, creamy mashed potatoes, buttery lobster tail, and roasted Brussels sprouts with pancetta. Next to it sat a separate dish with an individual serving of truffle mac and cheese and tub of sauce.</p><p>And beside the meal? A small, stuffed Christmas stocking and a tote bag with some Tupperware inside.</p><p>Rio let out a soft, breathless laugh, shaking her head in disbelief.</p><p>She carried through the door and into the kitchen, reaching for the stocking first, pulling it open to find an assortment of her favorite Christmas chocolates—peppermint bark, dark chocolate truffles, and even those tiny foil-wrapped chocolate Santas she had casually mentioned to Agatha in passing the other night.</p><p>Beneath the sweets, she found a small, wrapped box. Inside was a sleek, monogrammed leather stethoscope case with her initials embossed in gold.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, overwhelmed. Agatha had bought her another thoughtful present.</p><p>She had spent the entire day watching families reunite, comforting patients who had no one, pushing away the lingering pang of loneliness that sometimes crept in when she worked the holidays. She had told herself it didn’t matter, that this was just part of the job and she’d celebrated yesterday with her friends.</p><p>But now, standing in her quiet home with the warmth of Agatha’s thoughtfulness settling around her, she realized how much she had needed this.</p><p>How much she had needed her today.</p><p>With a deep breath, she warmed the plate of food and sat at the counter, grabbing a fork and taking her first bite of the meal Agatha had left her. The flavors melted on her tongue—rich, comforting, perfect.</p><p>She barely made it through half the plate before the curiosity of the totes contents got the better of her—several neatly stacked meal prep containers, labeled with sticky notes:</p><p>‘For the next few days’</p><p>Rio let out a choked laugh, running a hand down her face.</p><p>It was too much. It was perfect.</p><p>Reaching for her phone, she typed out a message, hesitating only a moment before sending it.</p><p>Rio: I don’t even know what to say. This is too much… you’re incredible, Agatha. Thank you.</p><p>A response came almost immediately.</p><p>Agatha: Eat first. Then call me if your feeling up to it</p><p>Rio smiled, shaking her head as she took another bite.</p><p>She had been planning to fall into bed the second she got home.</p><p>Now, all she wanted was to hear Agatha’s voice.</p><p>Later that night, full from the best meal she’d had in weeks, Rio lay back in bed, her phone pressed to her ear. The exhaustion from her shift still clung to her, but the warmth of Agatha’s gesture made her feel lighter.</p><p>Agatha’s voice came through soft and teasing. “So, did you eat everything like a good girl, or do I need to come over and personally make sure you finish your vegetables?”</p><p>Rio let out a low laugh, rubbing her hand over her face. “I cleaned my plate, I promise. And before you ask, yes, I also have the meal prep containers in my fridge. You’re ridiculous, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “I prefer the term thoughtful.”</p><p>Rio sighed, shifting onto her side, her comforter pulled up around her shoulders. “I mean it, though. You didn’t have to do all that. I wasn’t expecting… any of it.”</p><p>“Well, that’s the fun part,” Agatha murmured. “Surprising you.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, listening to the faint rustling on Agatha’s end, picturing her curled up in bed, maybe in one of those silky pajama sets Rio had already caught glimpses of when they’d face-timed.</p><p>“I hated the thought of you coming home to an empty home after working all day,” Agatha admitted, voice softer now. “I just wanted you to have something waiting for you.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, her chest tightening in a way that felt entirely too new and unfamiliar. “You did more than that.”</p><p>Silence stretched between them for a moment, comfortable and warm.</p><p>Then Agatha spoke again, her voice laced with something almost hesitant. “So… since I clearly impressed you with my Christmas dinner, I assume that means I can see you again soon?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “You’re really fishing for another date, huh?”</p><p>“I don’t fish,” Agatha said smoothly. “I set the perfect bait and wait for you to come to me.”</p><p>Rio let out a low laugh, shaking her head. “Oh, is that what this is? A slow trap?”</p><p>“More like a carefully curated experience,” Agatha teased.</p><p>Rio rolled onto her back, staring at the ceiling, biting back her smile. “Well, I guess I’m happy to have the experience then.”</p><p>“Mm, good. Then how about this? This time I take you out and then you can show me your greenhouse?”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a second, not because she didn’t want that—she did, badly—but because it had been a long time since she’d let someone in like that.</p><p>But then she pictured Agatha here, curled up on her couch, wrapped in one of Rio’s sweaters, maybe stealing bites of whatever takeout they ended up ordering because, Rio was embarrassing herself by cooking after tasting Agathas food.</p><p>The thought sent a pleasant shiver through her.</p><p>“Okay,” she murmured. “Stay over at mine after our next date.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, pleased. “Perfect. I’ll even but dessert.”</p><p>“Oh? And what exactly do you think dessert is?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice dipped into something more playful, more suggestive. “Well… that depends. Are you more of a chocolate lover? Or would you prefer something else?”</p><p>Rio groaned at the implication. “You’re impossible.”</p><p>“And yet, here you are, planning our next date.”</p><p>Rio grinned, running a hand through her hair whilst letting out a wide yawn. “Yeah, I guess I am.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice softened. “Your tired. Get some sleep, Rio. Goodnight.”</p><p>“You too, Agatha. Sweet dreams.”</p><p>They lingered for another moment before the call finally ended, but even as Rio set her phone down and closed her eyes, she knew she wouldn’t be falling asleep right away.</p>

<p>Agatha was never one to get nervous, not usually. But tonight? Tonight, she was nervous.</p><p>She checked her overnight bag one last time, making sure she hadn’t forgotten anything. Not that she needed to bring much, they’d decided to have a ‘date night in’. Rio had insisted she didn’t need to go overboard, but Agatha was nothing if not thorough. A change of clothes for the morning, a silk robe she had no intention of wearing for long, and a bottle of her favorite wine. And, of course, dessert.</p><p>Sharon leaned against the doorway of Agatha’s bedroom, arms crossed, watching her with an amused smirk. “You do realize this is just a casual sleepover at your new girlfriend’s place, not a mission, right?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look as she adjusted the strap of her overnight bag. “First of all, she’s not my girlfriend.”</p><p>“Yet,” Sharon interjected.</p><p>Agatha ignored her. “Second, I like to be prepared.”</p><p>Sharon chuckled, pushing off the doorframe and walking over to place a hand on Agatha’s shoulder. “You look great. She’s going to love whatever ridiculous dessert you’ve brought. And the kids and I will be perfectly fine, so stop worrying.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, nodding. “I know. Thank you for staying with them overnight.”</p><p>Sharon waved a hand. “Please, you act like I don’t love stealing them from you for a night. Nicholas has already informed me that we are going to build the biggest Lego spaceship known to man.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Well, make sure you don’t step on any pieces barefoot. I wouldn’t wish that pain on my worst enemy.”</p><p>“Duly noted.” Sharon tilted her head. “Now, get out of here before you overthink this and cancel.”</p><p>“I would never cancel,” Agatha scoffed, grabbing her coat. “I want this too much.”</p><p>Sharon smirked. “Good. Then go get your doctor.”</p><p>Agatha had expected Rio’s place to be minimalistic, maybe a little clinical—doctors weren’t exactly known for having an abundance of free time to curate their living spaces.</p><p>But stepping inside, she was pleasantly surprised. The home was small but warm, filled with personal touches—a bookshelf stacked with medical journals and classic novels, a soft throw blanket draped over the couch, and an open bottle of red wine sitting on the coffee table beside two glasses.</p><p>And then there was Rio herself.</p><p>Dressed in black lounge pants and a fitted navy sweater, she looked effortlessly beautiful, her dark hair still slightly damp from a shower. The sight made Agatha’s stomach flip in a way that felt alarmingly new.</p><p>“You made it,” Rio said, smiling as she stepped forward to take Agatha’s coat. “No last-minute emergencies?”</p><p>“Not unless you count Nicholas trying to convince me I should let him stay up all night building Legos with Sharon.”</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head. “I respect his determination.”</p><p>Agatha held up the small box she had brought. “I also come bearing dessert.”</p><p>Rio arched an eyebrow, taking the package from her and peeking inside. “Tiramisu? You do know me well.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I pay attention.”</p><p>Rio shook her head fondly, setting the box down before gesturing to the couch. “Wine?”</p><p>“Always.”</p><p>They settled in, the initial tension easing into something warm and familiar as they sipped their wine and talked about everything and nothing, eating Chinese takeout. Rio told her about the chaos of the past few days at the hospital—holiday-induced injuries, an absurd number of cases involving toy-related accidents, and one particularly memorable incident involving a man who had attempted to deep-fry a turkey indoors.</p><p>“You’d think people would know better by now,” Rio said, shaking her head.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, tucking her legs beneath her. “Human nature is endlessly surprising.”</p><p>They talked for what felt like hours, laughter slipping easily between them, the space between them growing smaller as the evening stretched on.</p><p>Eventually, Rio set her glass down, turning to face Agatha fully. “I’m glad you came over tonight.”</p><p>Agatha studied her, taking in the soft expression in her dark eyes, the way her fingers rested casually against her knee but still twitched slightly, like she was holding back from reaching out.</p><p>So Agatha closed the distance for her.</p><p>She leaned in, pressing a slow, deliberate kiss to Rio’s lips, savoring the warmth of it, the way Rio sighed softly against her mouth.</p><p>When they finally pulled away, Rio rested her forehead against Agatha’s. “That was overdue,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha hummed, her fingers tracing lightly over Rio’s wrist. “I like taking my time.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “You’re lucky I have patience.”</p><p>“Oh, I plan to test that tonight.”</p><p>Rio groaned, laughing as she pulled Agatha in for another kiss. The moment Agatha pressed her lips to Rio’s again, the slow-burning tension between them finally snapped.</p><p>Rio responded instantly, her hands gripping Agatha’s waist as she deepened the kiss, tilting her head to claim more. Agatha let herself be pulled closer, one hand sliding into Rio’s still-damp hair, the other tracing along the soft fabric of her sweater, feeling the warmth of her skin underneath.</p><p>There was something intoxicating about the way Rio kissed—thorough, focused, as if she were memorizing every movement. It sent a thrill down Agatha’s spine, the sensation of being wanted so completely making her dizzy.</p><p>They barely made it to the bedroom.</p><p>Somewhere between kisses, between quiet laughter and whispered confessions, they shed layers—Rio’s sweater tugged over her head, Agatha’s silk blouse slipping to the floor. The air between them grew heavier, charged, their breaths coming quicker as Rio guided Agatha back toward the bed.</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio murmured, her lips brushing against Agatha’s jaw, her hands resting just at her hips.</p><p>Agatha smiled, cupping Rio’s face between her hands and looking into her dark, searching eyes. “I wouldn’t be here if I wasn’t.”</p><p>That was all Rio needed.</p><p>The rest of the night was a blur of soft gasps and tangled limbs, Rio’s mouth tracing a slow path over Agatha’s skin, Agatha’s fingers mapping out every inch of Rio in return. It was unrushed, a quiet exploration that turned into something deeper, something neither of them wanted to let go of.</p><p>And afterward, when they lay tangled in the sheets, Agatha’s head resting against Rio’s bare chest, their fingers lazily intertwined, neither of them spoke for a long while.</p><p>Until Rio, voice thick with sleep, murmured, “I could get used to this.”</p><p>Agatha, already fighting the pull of exhaustion, smiled against her skin. “Me too.”</p><p>Agatha woke first. It took her a moment to reorient herself, to remember where she was and why she was so warm and content.</p><p>Then she felt Rio shift beside her, still deeply asleep, her dark hair tousled against the pillow, her features soft in the early morning light.</p><p>Agatha allowed herself a l moment to just simply watch her. To take in the rare vulnerability of Rio at rest, the faint furrow between her brows even in sleep, the way she had one arm draped over Agatha’s waist like she hadn’t wanted to let go during the night.</p><p>Then, carefully, Agatha slipped out of bed, wrapping herself in Rio’s robe, because her own was somewhere on the floor and she wanted the early morning comfort of staying surrounded by Rios scent.</p><p>She padded quietly to the kitchen, intent on making breakfast. Despite the size of Rio’s home, her kitchen was surprisingly spacious and well-stocked. Agatha found eggs, some fresh herbs, a block of good cheese, and even a decent loaf of bread.</p><p>By the time the scent of sizzling butter filled the air, she heard the sound of Rio stirring.</p><p>Moments later, Rio appeared in the doorway, still looking half-asleep, her dark eyes blinking drowsily as she ran a hand through her hair.</p><p>“Your cooking?” she mumbled, voice still thick with sleep.</p><p>Agatha smirked, turning away from the stove just long enough to flash her a look. “I have to impress you somehow.”</p><p>Rio huffed out a laugh and leaned against the counter, watching her. “You didn’t have to do this.”</p><p>“I wanted to.” Agatha plated the eggs, then sliced up some bread and arranged everything neatly before sliding a plate in front of Rio. “Besides, you fed me last night. It’s only fair I return the favor.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, studying her for a moment before smiling. “You’re something else, you know that?”</p><p>Agatha only winked and slid into the seat across from her. They ate in comfortable silence, the warmth from last night still lingering between them. It wasn’t until Rio had finished her coffee and leaned back against the counter that she said, “So, there’s something I should probably mention.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Oh?”</p><p>Rio set her mug down. “Wanda invited me to her New Year’s Eve party. I wasn’t sure if I was going, but…” She hesitated. “You’ll be there, won’t you?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, dabbing her mouth with a napkin. “Of course. Wanda wouldn’t let me miss it.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, looking oddly relieved. “Good. Then I guess I have no excuse not to go.”</p><p>Agatha leaned forward, resting her chin in her hand as she studied Rio with amusement. “Are you saying you’d only go if I were there?”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, but the slight flush on her cheeks gave her away. “I’m saying it’ll be more enjoyable if I know you’re around.”</p><p>Agatha grinned, reaching across the counter to trace her fingers over the back of Rio’s hand. “Then I suppose I’ll see you in a few days.”</p><p>Rio smirked, flipping her hand over to catch Agatha’s fingers in hers. “Yeah. I suppose you will.”</p><p>Agatha stretched lazily, enjoying the warmth of the kitchen, the lingering taste of coffee, and the way Rio kept stealing little glances at her like she couldn’t quite believe she was still here.</p><p>But reality was calling. Nicholas and Storey were waiting at home, likely wearing Sharon out with their endless energy, and as much as Agatha wanted to stay wrapped up in this bubble of quiet intimacy, she had responsibilities.</p><p>She sighed, setting down her empty coffee cup. “I should probably get going.”</p><p>Rio, who had been leaning against the counter in front of her, watching her with soft, sleepy eyes, hummed in reluctant agreement. “I figured.”</p><p>Neither of them moved. Agatha smirked, pushing back from the stool. “You gonna let me leave, or…?”</p><p>Rio crossed the small distance between them in two steps. “I’m thinking about it,” she murmured, resting her hands lightly on Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha exhaled a laugh, sliding her hands up to Rio’s shoulders. “Mm. I like your hesitation.”</p><p>Rio didn’t bother responding—she just kissed her. Slow and unhurried, like she wanted to make the most of these last few moments. Agatha melted into it, her fingers tangling in the hem of Rio’s shirt, considering, briefly, if she could afford to stay just a little longer.</p><p>But then her phone buzzed on the counter, a reminder that the world outside this apartment still existed.</p><p>Rio pulled back, sighing. “That’s your reality calling, huh?”</p><p>Agatha smiled apologetically. “That would be Sharon, most likely informing me that Nicky has attempted some sort of Lego-related engineering feat and Storeys bathes herself in breakfast.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Go, before they build a space station in your absence.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her once more, just because she could, before finally stepping away and gathering her things.</p><p>As she slipped on her coat, Rio trailed after her to the door, watching as she adjusted the strap of her overnight bag. “Drive safe, okay?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, reaching out to straighten Rio’s shirt collar. “You’re cute when you worry.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “I’m not cute, I’m handsome.”</p><p>Agatha softened, brushing her knuckles lightly over Rio’s jaw. “I’ll see you at Wanda’s party.”</p><p>Rio caught her hand before she could pull away, pressing a kiss to her knuckles. “Yeah. See you then.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for half a second, like she wanted to say something more, but then she simply smiled and slipped out the door, leaving behind the faint scent of her perfume and a quiet, lingering warmth.</p><p>The apartment felt different the second Agatha left. Not empty, exactly. Just quieter.</p><p>Rio exhaled, running a hand through her hair as she leaned against the closed door, staring at the space where Agatha had been only moments ago.</p><p>It had been a very long time since Rio had let herself get close to someone like this. Casual dates, the occasional night out—sure. But nothing that lingered. Nothing that had the potential to become something real. And yet, after just one night, she already knew Agatha was different.</p><p>She thought about the way Agatha had made breakfast without hesitation, like she belonged in Rio’s kitchen. The way she’d smoothed Rio’s collar, kissed her knuckles, left her with that teasing smirk like she already knew Rio would be thinking about her for the rest of the day.</p><p>God, she was falling. Hard.</p><p>Rio sighed, pushing away from the door and heading back to the kitchen to clean up.</p>

<p>Rio arrived at Wanda’s townhouse just after eight, stepping into the lively warmth of the party. The space was buzzing with conversation, laughter, and the unmistakable sounds of a well-thought playlist humming through the speakers. Wanda had outdone herself, again, her home was draped in shimmering gold and silver decorations, with a massive, glittering 2025 sign hanging over the fireplace.</p><p>Rio had barely shrugged off her coat when Wanda appeared at her side, grinning like a cat who had been expecting company.</p><p>“Well, well,” Wanda drawled, handing Rio a glass of champagne without preamble. “Didn’t think I’d see you here.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but accepted the drink. “You invited me.”</p><p>“Yes, but you always say you’ll come and then find a last-minute excuse to work, I thought my christmas party was the exception.” Wanda arched a knowing brow. “So, what changed?”</p><p>Rio took a slow sip of champagne, refusing to give Wanda the satisfaction of a reaction. “I figured I’d start the new year differently.”</p><p>Wanda gave her a long, amused look. “Uh-huh.”</p><p>Before she could press further, the front door opened, and Rio turned automatically—only to feel her breath hitch slightly at the sight before her.</p><p>Agatha had arrived.</p><p>And she was impossible to miss.</p><p>She stepped into the room like she owned it, her gold sequin dress catching the light with every movement. The fitted dressed shimmered, hugging her curves in a way that made Rio momentarily forget how to function. But it was the oversized black bow cascading down her bare back that added just the right amount of drama.</p><p>But what truly made Rio smile was the way she was balancing elegance and motherhood all at once.</p><p>Nicky, dressed in a tiny navy blazer, practically bounced at her side, his excitement barely contained. And Storey, bundled in a little black bow dress with gold stars, clung to Agatha’s hip, blinking wide-eyed at the festive decorations around them.</p><p>Rio didn’t even realize she was staring until Wanda smirked beside her.</p><p>“Oh,” Wanda murmured, “so that’s what changed.. I’m glad its going well”</p><p>Ignoring her, Rio set her drink down and made her way through the crowd.</p><p>Agatha spotted Rio before she reached them, and her lips curved into a knowing smile.</p><p>“Well, don’t you clean up nicely,” Agatha teased, her gaze flicking over Rio’s perfectly tailored black suit.</p><p>Rio scoffed. “Says the woman currently outshining the entire party.”</p><p>Nicholas grinned up at Rio. “Hello! You’re here!”</p><p>She ruffled his hair. “Of course I am, buddy. Wouldn’t miss it.”</p><p>Storey made a little gurgling noise, reaching a tiny hand toward Rio. Without hesitation, Rio extended a finger, letting Storey grip it as she wiggled happily in Agatha’s arms.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “You know, to say she’s only met you twice, she seems to like you an awful lot.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “What can I say? I’m charming.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, shifting Storey to her other hip. “We just got here, but Nicholas has already spotted the dessert table, so I’m bracing for sugar-induced chaos.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’ll help keep an eye on him. But first…” She lowered her voice slightly, stepping just a little closer. “I didn’t get the chance to say it properly yet, you look stunning.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, her smile softening. “Thank you. You’re not too bad yourself.”</p><p>For a brief second, Rio considered kissing her right then and there, but Nicholas had already darted off, and Agatha was adjusting Storey on her hip, distracted by their surroundings.</p><p>Instead, she reached out, letting her fingers brush over Agatha’s arm. “Come on. Let’s get you both settled in before Nicky raids the entire dessert table.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, following Rio further inside, already feeling the warmth of the night settling in.</p><p>If the way Rio kept looking at her was any indication, this was going to be a very good New Year’s Eve.</p><p>Rio had always respected Agatha since meeting, but watching her in action, balancing elegance, charm, and full-time mom duties now she a actually knew her, was something else entirely.</p><p>The party was in full swing, the music lively, the champagne flowing, and yet, amidst all the glitz and laughter, Agatha was seamlessly managing the children while still looking like she’d stepped off a Vogue cover.</p><p>Rio leaned against the kitchen doorway, sipping her drink as she observed Agatha wrangle Nicholas, Storey, and Wanda’s twin boys, Billy and Tommy, who were currently racing in circles around her with boundless energy.</p><p>Nicholas and the twins were a mischievous little trio that Agatha was clearly outnumbered against. Storey, on the other hand, was content in Agatha’s arms, her tiny fingers tangled in the fabric of her mother’s dress as she rested her head against Agatha’s shoulder, half-asleep despite the chaos.</p><p>“Alright, gentlemen,” Agatha announced, hands on her hips, looking thoroughly unimpressed as Nicky and the twins tried to organize a wrestling match on Wanda’s couch. “Unless you’d like to start the new year sitting in timeout, I suggest we redirect this energy elsewhere.”</p><p>Tommy grinned up at her. “But it’s almost midnight!”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Your right, darling. You three have your own special countdown.”</p><p>Wanda strolled over, looking far too amused as she sipped her cocktail. “You’re a saint for keeping them entertained, Aggie. I had no idea what to do with them before you got here.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “She makes it look easy, doesn’t she?”</p><p>Agatha shot them both a look. “You say that because you aren’t the one managing a preschool rebellion in sequins.”</p><p>Nicholas tugged on her hand impatiently. “Mama, when’s the countdown?”</p><p>Agatha crouched, brushing his wild curls out of his eyes, it was 9pm. “Right now. Let’s go outside.”</p><p>Excitement buzzed through the kids as Agatha led them all onto Wanda’s back patio, which was strung with fairy lights and lined with heaters to keep the winter chill at bay.</p><p>A cluster of balloons was tied together, hovering just under the pergola. Wanda had helped set them up earlier, each filled with gold and silver confetti for the grand kid-friendly New Year’s moment.</p><p>“Alright, gentlemen—and my little lady,” Agatha said, glancing down at Storey, who was still half-dozing against her. “On the count of ten, we say Happy New Year and these balloons will drop. Ready?”</p><p>The boys practically vibrated with excitement.</p><p>“Ten… nine… eight…”</p><p>Nicholas and the twins joined in loudly, their little voices overlapping.</p><p>“…Five… four… three… two… one!”</p><p>Wanda released the string, and the balloons came floating down, confetti bursting into the air around them. The boys shrieked with excitement, leaping to pop the balloons under their feet, while Storey let out a sleepy giggle, reaching for a falling piece of gold confetti.</p><p>Rio, watching from the sidelines, couldn’t stop the soft smile spreading across her face.</p><p>It was so simple, a fake countdown, a few balloons—but the pure joy on Nicky’s face, the way Agatha lit up just watching them, made it feel like magic.</p><p>Agatha met Rio’s gaze over the children’s heads, tilting her chin ever so slightly, as if to say, whats with the look.</p><p>Once the excitement settled, it took some time, but eventually, Agatha got all three boys wrangled into pajamas and through their bedtime routine. There was a lot of negotiation involved—Nicky needed a drink of water, Tommy insisted on one more bedtime story, and Billy wanted to show her his “super cool” new socks—but eventually, they all settled into bed.</p><p>Rio had stayed nearby, helping in small ways, handing over toothbrushes, flipping pages in the storybook but mostly, she had watched.</p><p>Watched as Agatha effortlessly handled the chaos, her patience never thinning. Watched as Nicholas nestled under the covers, looking up at his mother with pure trust and love in his eyes. Watched as Agatha smoothed a hand over his hair, whispering something soft that Rio couldn’t quite hear.</p><p>And suddenly, Rio felt like an intruder in a moment that wasn’t meant for her.  A wave of unease swept through her.</p><p>As Agatha turned off the bedside lamp, casting the room in a soft glow, a lump settled in Rio’s throat.</p><p>This wasn’t just some casual thing.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t just one person. She was this a mother, a provider, a whole world of love and responsibility that Rio had never imagined being part of.</p><p>And for the first time since meeting Agatha, a sharp panic curled in her chest.</p><p>She wasn’t built for this.</p><p>She had spent years keeping her life simple. No ties, no responsibilities beyond her job. She had convinced herself that love, real love, the kind that came with permanence and people who needed you, wasn’t for her.</p><p>But Agatha? She was all in and not just with Rio. With her children. With her whole, beautiful, chaotic life.</p><p>And Rio didn’t know if she could be part of that. Didn’t know if she should even try.</p><p>Agatha turned to her then, smiling softly. “Thanks for helping.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, forcing herself to nod. “Yeah. No problem.”</p><p>If Agatha noticed the way Rio’s voice was slightly off, the way she had stiffened, she didn’t mention it. Instead, she just reached for Rio’s hand, giving it a gentle squeeze before leading the way back downstairs.</p><p>But Rio barely felt it. Because the panic was still there, pressing in, whispering that maybe—just maybe—she was in over her head here.</p>

<p>As they stepped back into the warmth of the party, Rio let go of Agatha’s hand. It wasn’t intentional, at least, she told herself it wasn’t, but she still felt the absence of it as Agatha moved ahead, seamlessly slipping back into the crowd.</p><p>Music played, glasses clinked, and conversation buzzed around them, but Rio felt off.</p><p>She grabbed a drink from the kitchen where they had been laid out and lingered near the edge of the room, watching Agatha with the baby monitor tucked under her arm, laughing at something Wanda said, her gold sequin dress catching the light with every movement.</p><p>She was stunning. Gorgeous. Beautiful. And Rio felt like a coward.</p><p>Because all she could think about was how easy it had been, up until now. The flirting, the dates, their chemistry, the heat between them when they had spent the night together - it had been fun. Exciting. A complete rush.</p><p>But now, standing on the outside, watching Agatha as a mother, as someone whose life was built around other people who fully depended on her, Rio wasn’t sure where she fit into that picture.</p><p>She wasn’t sure if she could. It wasn’t even like she had not already known this, seen her with her kids before, but tonight - the whole bath and bed routine - had really hit her.</p><p>Agatha must have felt the shift in her thoughts and feelings because, as the night went on, she barely came over to Rio. There were no lingering touches, no soft smiles meant just for her. Rio kept her distance, moving away when Agatha did make a move towards her.</p><p>After her last move towards her, when their eyes did meet, there was something in Agatha’s gaze—something resigned.</p><p>Like she already knew what Rio was struggling to admit.</p><p>“Alright, Doctor Vidal.”</p><p>Rio turned to find Wanda beside her, arms crossed, gaze knowing.</p><p>“Wanda,” she said, forcing a light tone. “Enjoying your party?”</p><p>“Not as much as you are, apparently,” Wanda quipped, nodding toward the drink in Rio’s hand. “You’ve been nursing that for an hour and staring at Agatha like you just saw a ghost.”</p><p>Rio sighed, rubbing a hand over the back of her neck. “It’s nothing.”</p><p>Wanda scoffed. “Yeah, sure. Try that on someone who doesn’t know you both.”</p><p>Rio stayed silent, staring down into her drink.</p><p>Wanda sighed, her voice softening. “You’re freaking out, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio let out a humorless laugh. “That obvious?”</p><p>“Only to someone who knows you.” Wanda leaned against the counter. “You like her. I can see it. But now you’ve seen the rest of her life, and it’s scaring the hell out of you.”</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, finally looking at Wanda. “She’s a mom, Wanda. And not just in the ‘sometimes’ kind of way. It’s all of her. I just—I don’t know if I can…” She trailed off, struggling to find the words.</p><p>“If you can take that on?” Wanda supplied gently.</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>Wanda studied her for a moment before sighing. “Look, I get it. It’s a lot. Agatha’s life isn’t simple, and she’s not a casual kind of woman. But let me tell you something—” She tilted her head toward Agatha, who was now balancing Storey on her hip while chatting with another guest. “—anyone would be insanely lucky to have her.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. “I know that.”</p><p>“Do you?” Wanda arched a brow. “Because right now, it looks like you’re already halfway out the door.”</p><p>Rio flinched.</p><p>Wanda shook her head. “Listen, I’m not here to tell you what to do. But if you do walk away from her, do it for the right reasons—not just because you’re scared.”</p><p>Rio stared at her for a long moment before glancing back at Agatha—at the woman who had let her in, who had shared her bed, who had trusted Rio to be part her life, even just for a little while.</p><p>And all Rio could think was—  ‘I don’t want to hurt her.’</p><p>But she didn’t know if not hurting her was an option. And that thought scared her more than anything.</p><p>As the minutes ticked closer to midnight, Agatha stood near the edge of the room, nursing a drink she had no real intention of finishing. The party was still in full swing—laughter, music, the murmur of conversations blending into the familiar hum of celebration.</p><p>But Agatha felt removed from it all.</p><p>She had known, the second they came back downstairs from putting the boys to bed, that something had changed.</p><p>Rio had barely looked at her. And that told her everything she needed to know.</p><p>She had seen it before, people who thought they could handle what it meant to be part of her life but then actually saw it. Actually saw the messiness, the responsibilities, the way her world wasn’t just hers but belonged to two small children as well.  Children who she would always put first.</p><p>It wasn’t casual. It wasn’t easy. And for most people, that was too much.</p><p>She understood. She always understood, it was why she hadn’t let anyone in until Rio.</p><p>But that didn’t make it hurt any less.</p><p>She took a slow sip of her drink, letting the burn of it settle in her chest as the countdown to midnight loomed closer.</p><p>The party had turned more electric, more frantic, people pairing off, laughter growing louder, excitement buzzing in the air. She caught a glimpse of Wanda throwing her a worried glance, but Agatha just offered her a small smile.</p><p>Rio was standing near the far end of the room, looking as tense as Agatha had ever seen her.</p><p>She wasn’t watching Agatha, she was actively avoiding her. Diverting course the minute Agatha took a step towards her.</p><p>And that, more than anything, was the final confirmation.</p><p>Agatha exhaled softly, setting her drink down on the nearest table. Then, without hesitation, she walked past Rio, pausing just long enough to lay a gentle hand on her arm.</p><p>Rio tensed under her touch.</p><p>Agatha squeezed lightly, then murmured, just loud enough for her to hear, “It’s okay. I understand.”</p><p>Then she walked away. She didn’t look back. Didn’t let herself wait for a response that wasn’t coming.</p><p>Instead, she found Sharon, who had also been invited by Wanda and slid her arm through hers, a smile firmly in place as the countdown began.</p><p>10… 9… 8…</p><p>The crowd erupted into cheers, voices mixing together in joy.</p><p>Agatha smiled. She laughed when Nicholas, still half-asleep, peeked out from the top of the stairs, rubbing his eyes and asking groggily if it was time for presents. She held Storey close as Sharon kissed her on the cheek and whispered, “Happy New Year, love."</p><p>And through it all, she ignored the ache in her chest.</p><p>She ignored the fact that somewhere in this room, Rio was standing alone, making her choice. And Agatha was making hers too.</p><p>She wasn’t going to wait for someone to love her the way she and her children deserved. Not even for Rio.</p><p>Rio didn’t move for a long time.</p><p>She stood frozen as the countdown erupted around her, as cheers rang out, as people clinked glasses and kissed and laughed. She should have moved, should have turned, should have done something, but instead, she stood there, Agatha’s words echoing in her head.</p><p>“It’s okay. I understand."</p><p>It wasn’t okay, though. Not really.</p><p>Rio let out a slow breath, staring down at the drink in her hand, barely touched. Her fingers tightened around the glass as she swallowed against the lump in her throat.</p><p>She hadn’t needed to say anything. Agatha had understood the moment Rio had pulled away. She had seen the hesitation, the fear, had accepted it with grace, with that same quiet strength she carried everywhere.</p><p>And instead of pushing, instead of demanding explanations or false promises, she had simply let Rio go.</p><p>That should have made Rio feel relieved.</p><p>So why did she feel like complete shit?</p><p>She wasn’t new to fear. She had spent years overcoming it—through med school, through grueling shifts, through moments of helplessness when she couldn’t save a child no matter how hard she tried.</p><p>She was good at managing fear. Good at compartmentalizing it, at turning it into something productive.</p><p>But this?</p><p>This wasn’t the kind of fear she knew how to fight. Because this wasn’t about her career or her patients.</p><p>This was about her.</p><p>About whether or not she could be something more than what she had always told herself she was.</p><p>She was a paediatric doctor, for God’s sake. It wasn’t like she didn’t like kids. She had spent her entire life caring for them, fighting for them, watching over them when their own parents were too scared to.</p><p>But that was different.</p><p>Because when she clocked out, she went home to herself. To silence. To an empty home where she didn’t have to be responsible for anyone but her. She had spent so long believing that was the only way she could exist.</p><p>That getting too close to people, to love, meant opening herself up to loss.</p><p>But Agatha, Agatha had let her in.</p><p>Had trusted her enough to let her see the most intimate parts of her life, not just the easy parts, not just the laughter and the flirting and the heat, but the real parts. The parts where she was a mother before anything else.</p><p>And Rio had run. She exhaled sharply, dragging a hand down her face. She wasn’t even sure what she was running from.</p><p>Responsibility? Maybe.</p><p>Change? Definitely.</p><p>But the worst part, the part she didn’t want to admit, even to herself, was that she wasn’t just scared of failing.</p><p>She was scared of wanting it too much.</p><p>Of falling too hard, too fast.</p><p>Of loving Agatha and Nicholas, and Storey, and realizing that there was a space for her in their lives that she might not be strong enough to fill.</p><p>“It’s okay. I understand."</p><p>God.</p><p>Had she just made the biggest mistake of her life?</p>

<p>Agatha woke to the soft gray light of morning, the light of a new year,  filtering through Wanda’s guestroom curtains. For a brief, blissful moment, she didn’t remember.</p><p>Didn’t remember Rio’s distance.</p><p>Didn’t remember the way her touch had lingered for just a second too long before she walked away.</p><p>Didn’t remember the quiet, painful understanding that had settled in her chest when she realized Rio wasn’t choosing her.</p><p>But then it all came rushing back.</p><p>She exhaled sharply, staring at the ceiling, willing away the sting behind her eyes.  She’d known her inly a month, she wouldn’t cry, no matter how much her heart hurt and she wanted to.</p><p>She shouldn’t be surprised. She wasn’t surprised.</p><p>This wasn’t the first time someone had seen the full weight of her life and decided it was too much.</p><p>But she hadn’t trusted anyone to get close until Rio.</p><p>And maybe that was her mistake.</p><p>Maybe she had let herself believe, just for a moment, that this could be different. That Rio was different.</p><p>That night together, just days ago, had meant something. She wasn’t naive enough to think it had been just about sex. Rio had been there, present, caring, affectionate.</p><p>She had held Agatha like she mattered. Like she mattered.</p><p>And yet, as soon as she’d seen the reality of it, seen Agatha wrangling three little boys into pajamas, checking baby monitors, wiping little faces clean of frosting and tucking them in, she had vanished.</p><p>Not physically.</p><p>But in every way that counted.</p><p>A soft knock at the door pulled her from her thoughts.</p><p>“Come in,” she called, her voice rough from sleep.</p><p>Wanda slipped inside, a cup of coffee in one hand, a plate with a croissant in the other. “Brought you a peace offering. Thought you might need it after last night.”</p><p>Agatha sat up with a sigh, accepting the coffee. “Thanks.”</p><p>Wanda climbed in beside her, turning on her side and watching her carefully. “You want to talk about it?”</p><p>Agatha stared down at her cup, fingers tracing the rim. “Not much to talk about.”</p><p>Wanda arched a brow. “That bad, huh?”</p><p>Agatha let out a humorless laugh. “Worse. She just shut down on me, Wanda. Completely. We were fine, better than fine. And then I put the kids to bed, and it was like a switch flipped in her. She barely looked at me after that.”</p><p>Wanda sighed, setting the plate down on the nightstand. “I saw it, you know. The way she was avoiding you. I was hoping I was wrong.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I don’t know why I’m surprised. People love the idea of me. Of this little, ready-made family that looks sweet on the outside, that comes with the luxuries. But when it comes down to it—when they see what it actually means to be in my life—they get scared.” She swallowed hard. “And they leave. This is why i’ve not let anyone in since Nicky was a baby.”</p><p>Wanda frowned. “Agatha—”</p><p>“I just thought she was different,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Silence stretched between them.</p><p>Then, Wanda sighed. “Look. I like Rio. She’s a good person. But I also know fear when I see it.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “She knew I had kids. The first time we met I was juggling the kids. Storey came in our first date! It’s not like this was a surprise.”</p><p>“I know,” Wanda said gently. “But knowing something and seeing it fully in action are two different things. She’s spent her whole life keeping people at arm’s length, and you—you’re not the kind of woman someone can love halfway.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. “Then maybe she shouldn’t have started. I just think i’m not a woman that’s supposed to be loved.”</p><p>Wanda reached over, squeezing her hand. “Don’t you ever say that. I love you. And it doesn’t mean she didn’t want to.”</p><p>Agatha looked away. She didn’t want to hear that.</p><p>Didn’t want to think about Rio sitting in her apartment, alone, probably relieved that she’d cut things off, a fresh start for the new year.</p><p>Because in the end, intentions didn’t matter, she might have intended for them to have something for a little while. What mattered was the choice Rio had made.</p><p>And last night, she had chosen distance, had chosen avoidance.</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t beg someone to love her. Not even Rio.</p><p>By late morning, Agatha had the kids bundled up and packed into the car, their bags tucked neatly in the trunk. Nicholas was still groggy from staying up too late, his little head lolling against his car seat as he sucked his thumb, something he only did when he was truly exhausted. Storey had fussed until Agatha settled her with a bottle, and now she was half-asleep too, her tiny hands curled against her chest.</p><p>Wanda helped double-check that everything was packed before giving Agatha a knowing look.</p><p>“You’ll be okay?” she asked quietly as Agatha shut the trunk.</p><p>Agatha forced a small smile. “Yeah. I’m Just tired.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t look convinced, but she didn’t push. “Well, you know where to find me.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, glancing back at the house. Vision and the boys stood in the doorway, watching them leave, wanda stepped back, arms crossed, concern in her gaze. Agatha lifted a hand in farewell before sliding into the driver’s seat and pulling away.</p><p>She didn’t check her phone. Didn’t let herself check her phone. Because if Rio hadn’t messaged… she wasn’t sure how she’d feel. And if she had?</p><p>She didn’t know if she was ready for whatever excuse or apology might be waiting.</p><p>The drive home was quiet. Nicholas dozed off in the back, and Storey let out little sleepy sighs, oblivious to the tension sitting heavy in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>By the time she pulled into the driveway, she was exhausted in a way that had nothing to do with lack of sleep. She carried Storey inside first, settling her crib with a soft blanket. Then she went back for Nicholas, who grumbled sleepily as she unbuckled him.</p><p>“Is it still New Years eve?” he mumbled against her shoulder as she carried him inside.</p><p>Agatha smiled, pressing a kiss to his curls. “No, baby. It’s a brand new day.”</p><p>Nicholas sighed, clearly too tired to argue, and let her tuck him onto the couch with a pillow and his favorite stuffed dinosaur.</p><p>Once both kids were settled, Agatha sank onto the armrest of the couch and finally reached for her phone. Her stomach twisted.</p><p>No messages.</p><p>No missed calls.</p><p>Rio hadn’t reached out.</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath, staring at the blank screen for a long moment before locking it again.</p><p>What had she expected?</p><p>For Rio to suddenly change her mind overnight? To have some big epiphany and come running back, saying she could do this, that she wanted this?</p><p>No.</p><p>Rio had made her choice.</p><p>And Agatha wasn’t going to waste her time waiting for someone who wasn’t willing to fight for her. She had her own life to live. And it didn’t include waiting around for a woman who had already walked away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat at her kitchen table, staring at the untouched coffee in front of her. It had long since gone cold, but she hadn’t moved to pour it out.</p><p>She hadn’t done much of anything since coming home last night, except sit in silence and think about all the ways she had screwed up.</p><p>She had barely slept.</p><p>Every time she closed her eyes, all she could see was Agatha. The way she had looked at Rio last night, really looked at her, as if she already knew what was coming. As if she had expected it.</p><p>And the worst part?</p><p>The way she had understood.</p><p>She hadn’t been angry, hadn’t demanded explanations. She had just let Rio go. And that made Rio feel even worse.</p><p>Because Agatha shouldn’t have to understand. She shouldn’t have to make peace with being left behind when she had done nothing wrong. When she hadn’t even been given the courtesy of an explanation.</p><p>Rio groaned, dragging her hands over her face.</p><p>What the hell was wrong with her?</p><p>She liked Agatha. More than liked Agatha. She wanted  Agatha.</p><p>Had wanted her from the moment they met, from the moment Agatha flashed that knowing little smirk and made Rio feel like she was the only person in the room.</p><p>And she had been so good with her kids.</p><p>Nicholas, with his endless curiosity and cheekiness that was all his mother, darting about when they played the ridiculous balloon game.</p><p>Storey, all soft baby warmth, falling asleep on Agatha’s shoulder, completely safe in her mother’s arms.</p><p>Rio hadn’t left because she didn’t want them. She had left because she did. Because the idea of wanting them, of wanting all of it, scared the hell out of her.</p><p>And in trying to protect herself, she had done exactly what she swore she never would. She had hurt Agatha.</p><p>She exhaled sharply, shoving her chair back and standing up. She couldn’t leave things like this.</p><p>She wouldn’t.</p><p>Grabbing her phone, she hesitated only a moment before typing out a message.</p><p>Rio: I owe you an apology. Can I see you?*</p><p>She stared at the screen, heart pounding.</p><p>The message stayed on ‘delivered.’</p><p>No reply.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. She deserved that.</p><p>But she wasn’t giving up.</p><p>Agatha sat on the couch, her fingers idly tracing the rim of her coffee mug. Nicholas was curled up beside her, still half-asleep despite the bright morning light filtering through the curtains. Storey was on her playmat, babbling to herself as she gnawed on one of her plush toys.</p><p>It should have been a peaceful morning.</p><p>But Agatha’s phone sat on the coffee table, taunting her with Rio’s unread message.</p><p>I owe you an apology. Can I see you?</p><p>She had seen it yesterday. Had read it, re-read it, and then set her phone down without replying. She didn’t know what to say.</p><p>Because Rio had owed her an apology. But was it too late?</p><p>Nicholas shifted against her side. “Mama?” he mumbled sleepily.</p><p>“Yeah, baby?”</p><p>“Are you gonna see Rio today?”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted. She had no idea how much he had picked up on last night, but kids were perceptive. They knew when something was off, even if they didn’t have the words for it.</p><p>“I don’t know,” she admitted, smoothing his curls.</p><p>Nicholas yawned and snuggled in closer. “I like her.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes briefly. Yeah. Me too.</p><p>She let out a slow breath and picked up her phone. Before she could overthink it, she typed out a response.</p><p>Agatha: I don’t know, Rio. I’m not sure what there is to say.</p><p>The reply came almost instantly.</p><p>Rio: There’s a lot to say. I just need a chance to say it.</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>She should say no. She should tell Rio that she had made her choice, and that she couldn’t afford to let someone in who was just going to leave when things got real.</p><p>But she also knew herself. And she knew that if she didn’t hear Rio out, she would always wonder.</p><p>Agatha: Fine. Come over tonight after the kids are asleep.</p><p>Rio: I’ll be there</p><p>Rio had expected Agatha’s house to be nice.</p><p>Agatha was effortlessly put-together, and of course, there was the fact that she was a self-made business woman.</p><p>But stepping inside Agatha’s home for the first time, Rio realized she had underestimated just how wealthy she really was. The foyer alone was bigger than Rio’s entire downstairs.</p><p>The floors were a gleaming, dark hardwood, and a staircase curved elegantly up to the second floor. Soft lighting cast a golden glow over the space, illuminating tasteful artwork on the walls. Everything was expensive but understated, luxury without the need to show it.</p><p>And yet, despite the sheer wealth surrounding her, the house still felt lived in. A small pair of sneakers was tucked neatly beside the entryway. A baby blanket lay draped over the arm of a chair. A toy dinosaur rested on the console table, as if it had been placed there mid-adventure.</p><p>It was a home.</p><p>It was Agatha’s home. And Rio felt like an intruder.</p><p>Agatha led her into the living room, where a fire crackled and the space was much more lived in. The Christmas tree still stood in the corner, twinkling softly. A basket nearby, filled with plush toys and baby blankets.</p><p>But Agatha herself was distant.</p><p>She sat in an armchair, rather than beside Rio on the couch. Her posture was poised, guarded, her warm smiles from a few days ago and throughout their relationship replaced with something cooler, more reserved.</p><p>She was letting Rio speak, but she wasn’t letting her in. She could see the emotional wall that she had up.</p><p>And Rio couldn’t blame her.</p><p>“I didn’t realize you lived like this” Rio admitted, gesturing vaguely at the house around them.</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “It doesn’t really matter anymore, does it?”</p><p>Rio hesitated. “No. But I won’t pretend it’s not a little intimidating.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, pinching her nose, setting her glasses on the side table. “Rio, let’s be honest. You didn’t leave react the other night how you did because of this.” She gestured to the house. “You left because of them. Because of my kids. And that’s fine, I can’t afford to get involved with someone who doesn’t want all of me.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees. “You think I don’t want that?”</p><p>Agatha met her gaze, expression unreadable. “No. Rio. And I think if I let you back in too easily, you’ll do it again the next time things get too real.”</p><p>Rio swallowed. “I won’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips quirked, but there was no humor in it. “You say that now. But I have two little people depending on me. I don’t get to make reckless choices.”</p><p>There it was. The distance. The walls. And Rio understood why.</p><p>She had been so afraid of the weight of Agatha’s life, so afraid of wanting something that mattered, that she had run. And in doing so, she had proven every one of Agatha’s worst fears right.</p><p>“I get it,” Rio said quietly. “I hurt you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t deny it.</p><p>Rio let out a slow breath, gathering her thoughts. “I’m not going to make excuses. I was scared. But not because of Nicholas or Storey. Not because of your life. I was scared because of me. Because I knew that if I let myself really want this, then there was no going back. No half-measures.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, watching her carefully.</p><p>Rio met her gaze, steady. “I don’t want to run. I don’t want to lose this. But I know I have to prove that to you.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a long moment.</p><p>Then, finally, she exhaled and stood.</p><p>“It’s getting late and I have a busy schedule tomorrow,” she said, her voice softer now. “You can take some of the christmas cookies with you, we baked too many. ”</p><p>It wasn’t forgiveness. But it was something. And for now, Rio would take it.</p><p>By January 4th, Rio had waited long enough.</p><p>She had given Agatha space, not wanting to push when it was clear Agatha had pulled back. But if she waited for Agatha to make the first move, she’d be waiting forever. So she took a deep breath and sent the text.</p><p>Rio: Can I take you to dinner? No pressure, no expectations</p><p>She set her phone down, heart pounding. She wasn’t sure if Agatha would even reply, let alone say yes.</p><p>But a few minutes later, her screen lit up.</p><p>Agatha: Okay</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>She had expected a rejection. Some excuse, some polite brush-off. Instead, she got a simple, cautious okay.</p><p>Rio: Friday? I’ll pick you up at seven?</p><p>A few beats passed before Agatha responded.</p><p>Agatha: Sounds good</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, a mix of relief and nerves settling in her chest. Agatha had agreed, but that didn’t mean she had let her guard down. Not yet. And Rio needed to be prepared for that.</p><p>The next morning at work, Wanda strolled into the hospital break room, her curls bouncing as she plopped into the chair across from Rio.</p><p>“So.” Wanda propped her chin on her hand. “You asked her out again.”</p><p>Rio arched a brow. “How do you know that?”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “Please. Agatha is my best friend, she tells me things.”</p><p>Rio sighed, rubbing a hand over her face. “She said yes. But I don’t think it means much yet.”</p><p>Wanda’s smirk faded. “It doesn’t.”</p><p>Rio met her gaze. “You don’t think I have a shot?”</p><p>Wanda exhaled, crossing her arms. “I think Agatha never lets people in. And I think you proved exactly why she doesn’t.”</p><p>The words hit like a punch to the gut.</p><p>Wanda leaned back in her chair. “Look, I’m not saying you don’t deserve a second chance. But Agatha is careful with her heart. She’s had to be. It took a lot for her to let you in, and when she did, you bailed the second things felt real.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard.</p><p>Wanda studied her. “So, if you’re serious about this, you need to show her. Not with words, not with big romantic gestures—just by being there. And not running when things get complicated.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly.</p><p>Wanda’s expression softened. “She likes you, you know. More than she’s probably comfortable admitting. That’s why she agreed to the date.”</p><p>Rio let out a slow breath, determination settling in her chest.</p><p>She had one shot.</p><p>And this time, she wasn’t going to blow it.</p>

<p>Agatha wasn’t sure she was making the right decision.</p><p>Agreeing to see Rio again felt like willingly stepping back into a fire she had only just pulled herself out of. It still burned. The wound wasn’t fresh, but it hadn’t healed either.</p><p>She should have said no. But she hadn’t.</p><p>And now, standing in front of her full-length mirror, smoothing down the silk of her dress, she wondered if she was setting herself up to get hurt again.</p><p>Her reflection stared back at her, poised and composed, betraying nothing. That was the trick, wasn’t it? If anyone saw her now, they would think she was confident. They would see the sleekness of her dress, the effortless elegance of her posture, and believe that she was in control.</p><p>No one would know that beneath the polished surface, doubt gnawed at her like a persistent ache.</p><p>The dress was a deep, rich cobalt, the kind of color that made her skin glow. Custom-tailored, it fit her perfectly, hugging her figure in all the right places before flaring at the hem in a way that was elegant rather than ostentatious. Sky-high Louboutins added to the illusion of control, of power. Understated diamond jewelry—just a delicate bracelet and small earrings—completed the look.</p><p>It was armor.</p><p>Because that was who she had to be.</p><p>She had learned long ago that control was the only thing keeping her from crumbling.</p><p>And Rio—Rio had made her lose that control.</p><p>It had been foolish, really. Letting her guard down. Letting herself hope. She had spent years carefully constructing a life where no one could hurt her, and then she had gone and handed Rio the power to do exactly that.</p><p>And, of course, Rio had used that power.</p><p>Not maliciously. Not cruelly. Just in the way people always did when they got too close.</p><p>They saw her life, the weight of it, and they decided it was too much.</p><p>Agatha had expected it. Prepared for it.</p><p>And yet, when Rio had pulled away at Wanda’s party, the rejection had stung. Not in the way she had braced for, but deeper, sharper. Like a wound she hadn’t even realized she had was suddenly laid bare.</p><p>She wasn’t used to feeling like that. She wasn’t used to allowing herself to feel like that.</p><p>She should have left it alone. She should have told Rio no when she asked for another chance.</p><p>But she hadn’t.</p><p>A soft babble from behind her pulled her out of her thoughts.</p><p>She turned to see Storey sitting on the bed, gumming the ear of a well-loved stuffed bunny, her big dark eyes fixed on Agatha.</p><p>A small smile tugged at Agatha’s lips despite herself. She crouched down, smoothing a gentle hand over her daughter’s soft curls. “What do you think, sweetheart?” she murmured. “Am I making a mistake?”</p><p>Storey responded by letting out a happy squeal, flopping onto her back with her chubby hands in the air.</p><p>Agatha chuckled, leaning down to press a kiss to her daughter’s forehead. “Not very helpful.”</p><p>Nicholas appeared in the doorway then, dressed in his favorite dinosaur pajamas, his eyes bright with curiosity. “Mama, are you going to your date now?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, standing. “I am, sweetheart.”</p><p>Nicholas considered this, then frowned. “Will you be back to tuck me in?”</p><p>Her heart ached at the question.</p><p>He was getting older, more independent, but he still wanted her there at bedtime.</p><p>She crouched to his level, brushing his messy curls back. “Not tonight, baby. But Sharon is here, and you love Sharon, don’t you?”</p><p>Nicholas huffed, clearly unimpressed. “She doesn’t do the voices in the bedtime stories like you do.”</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “I’ll do extra voices tomorrow, okay?”</p><p>He sighed dramatically but nodded. “Okay.”</p><p>She straightened, adjusting the diamond bracelet on her wrist. “Be good for Sharon.”</p><p>“I’m always good.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow.</p><p>“…Mostly.”</p><p>Sharon appeared behind him then, smirking. “Alright, mister, let your mama go. We’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for just a second.</p><p>Was she really doing this?</p><p>But then Sharon gave her a knowing look—one that said, ‘You deserve to live, too.’</p><p>And so Agatha forced a smile, grabbed her clutch, and walked out the door after pressing a final kiss to both children’s heads.</p><p>She wasn’t sure if she was making the right decision.</p><p>But for tonight, she was making it anyway.</p><p>When Rio pulled up outside Agatha’s house, she took a deep breath, rolling her shoulders.</p><p>She needed this to go well.</p><p>This wasn’t just any woman she was picking up for dinner—it was Agatha.</p><p>The same Agatha she had already let down once.</p><p>The same Agatha she was hoping, desperately, to win back.</p><p>She climbed out of the car, adjusting the cuff of her blazer as she stepped onto the pristine driveway.</p><p>She barely had time to process the weight of this moment before the door opened, and her breath hitched.</p><p>Agatha was stunning.</p><p>The deep cobalt of her dress made her skin glow under the soft porch lights. The fabric hugged her figure in a way that was both elegant and sensual, and her long legs were made even longer by the sharp, sky-high heels she wore. Her dark hair was swept into a chic, simple updo, exposing the graceful curve of her neck, and her only jewelry was a delicate diamond bracelet and small matching earrings.</p><p>She was breathtaking.</p><p>And she was watching Rio carefully, as if assessing her reaction.</p><p>Rio wanted to tell her a thousand things. That she had never stopped thinking about her. That leaving had been the worst mistake of her life. That if she was given even half a chance, she wouldn’t make the same mistake again.</p><p>But she wasn’t sure Agatha would believe her.</p><p>So she swallowed the words down and instead offered a small smile as she stepped forward, reaching for the passenger door.</p><p>“You look beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow, her expression unreadable.</p><p>Rio hesitated, then, before she could second-guess herself, leaned in and pressed a soft kiss to Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>It was barely there, just a brush of lips against skin, but she felt the way Agatha tensed for a split second before relaxing.</p><p>She didn’t pull away.</p><p>Progress.</p><p>Rio gestured to the open car door. “Shall we?”</p><p>Agatha let out a small breath, then nodded, slipping into the seat with practiced grace.</p><p>As Rio shut the door behind her and made her way to the driver’s side, she told herself that this was good.</p><p>Agatha was here.</p><p>She hadn’t pulled away.</p><p>She had agreed to this date.</p><p>That had to mean something.</p><p>The restaurant was warm, dimly lit, and smelled incredible—lemongrass, chili, and something rich and coconut-based. It wasn’t flashy, but it was one of the best Thai places in the city. The kind of place where the food spoke for itself, where the low hum of conversation mixed with soft music, where the intimate booths offered just enough privacy without feeling secluded.</p><p>Rio had chosen it intentionally.</p><p>She wanted somewhere comfortable but not too comfortable. Somewhere that made space for conversation, for careful navigation. Somewhere Agatha might feel like this wasn’t a mistake.</p><p>And, slowly but surely, that was exactly what happened.</p><p>The tension, the careful distance Agatha had kept between them at the start of the evening, began to soften.</p><p>By the time they were halfway through their appetizers—crispy spring rolls and delicate shrimp dumplings—the air between them had shifted. The guarded hesitations, the sharp edges of uncertainty? They weren’t gone completely, but they had dulled, smoothed over by the easy rhythm of conversation that neither of them had quite forgotten.</p><p>Rio had missed this.</p><p>The way Agatha could deliver a perfectly deadpan joke that nearly made her choke on her drink. The subtle way she gestured with her hands when she spoke—never exaggerated, always controlled. The way she studied Rio when she thought she wasn’t looking, as if she were still trying to decide if this was worth the risk.</p><p>God, she hoped she decided it was worth it.</p><p>“So,” Agatha mused, swirling her wine in its glass. “Why Thai?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Because you have excellent taste, and I needed a place that wouldn’t require a second mortgage.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, shaking her head. “You think you’re funny.”</p><p>“Oh, I know I’m funny.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but Rio caught the small twitch of her lips, the hint of amusement she was trying to suppress.</p><p>“Debatable,” she muttered, but there was no real bite to it.</p><p>Rio grinned, taking a sip of her drink before setting it down, leveling Agatha with an easy gaze. “Admit it. You missed me.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression didn’t change at first. Rio expected her to deflect, to offer some teasing remark in return, something to keep her walls firmly in place.</p><p>But then Agatha exhaled softly, her fingers running along the rim of her glass, as if debating whether or not to say what was on her mind.</p><p>“…I did miss you.”</p><p>Rio’s smile faltered, something warm settling deep in her chest.</p><p>She hadn’t expected that. Not that level of honesty, not so soon.</p><p>And from the way Agatha looked almost surprised at her own words, neither had she.</p><p>For the first time all night, Rio let herself hope.</p><p>Really, truly hope.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe… she hadn’t lost this after all.</p><p>Later, Rio’s apartment was quiet, the soft glow of the city filtering through the floor-to-ceiling windows as she unlocked the door and stepped inside, Agatha close behind.</p><p>There had been no discussion about coming back here. No should we or do you want to—it had been understood. Written in the lingering looks over dinner, in the way Agatha’s fingers had trailed along the stem of her wine glass, in the way Rio’s hand had brushed against hers in the car and lingered just long enough to feel the warmth of her skin.</p><p>Now, as the door clicked shut behind them, silence stretched between them.</p><p>But it wasn’t awkward.</p><p>It was charged.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze settled on Rio, searching.</p><p>And Rio saw the decision in her eyes before she even moved.</p><p>She barely had time to take a breath before Agatha closed the distance, pressing up onto her toes and capturing Rio’s lips with her own.</p><p>The kiss was slow at first, deliberate. Like Agatha was reminding herself of this, of Rio.</p><p>Then, as Rio slid her hands to Agatha’s waist, pulling her in, it deepened—turning into something hungrier, something urgent, something that made Rio’s breath hitch as Agatha pressed their bodies flush together.</p><p>There was no hesitation this time. No second-guessing.</p><p>This was inevitable. And they both knew it.</p><p>They barely made it to the bedroom before Rio was sliding the zipper down the back of Agatha’s dress, her fingers tracing the newly exposed skin reverently, like she was unwrapping something precious.</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet hum, tilting her head to press a kiss to Rio’s jaw, her lips trailing down, down—making Rio shiver.</p><p>And then there was no more talking. No more thinking. Just hands and mouths and heat. Just them.</p><p>Rio lay tangled in the sheets, her skin still warm, her breathing steadying.</p><p>Agatha was next to her, propped up on one elbow, her hair a little messier now, her lipstick long gone.</p><p>She looked soft like this. Unhurried. Like maybe—for just this moment—she wasn’t carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders.</p><p>Rio didn’t want to ruin it, but the thought pressed at her ribs, impossible to ignore.</p><p>Does this mean she’s giving me another chance?</p><p>She wanted to ask. Wanted to reach for Agatha, pull her back into the warmth of the bed, tell her to stay.</p><p>But before she could say anything, Agatha sighed, shifting slightly.</p><p>“I can’t stay the night,” she murmured, not quite meeting Rio’s eyes.</p><p>Rio swallowed the disappointment that rose in her throat. She should have expected this. She had truthfully expected this. Agatha had always made it clear her children came first, and Rio respected that.</p><p>Still, she rolled onto her side, reaching out to tuck a stray strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. “I figured.”</p><p>Agatha finally met her gaze, searching. “It’s not… it’s nothing to do with New Year. I just need to be home when they wake up.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I get it.”</p><p>And she did. But it didn’t make it sting any less.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, pressing a lingering kiss to Rio’s lips before slipping out of bed.</p><p>Rio watched as she dressed, the blue silk of her dress sliding back over her body, her movements fluid, practiced. She didn’t rush, but she didn’t linger, either.</p><p>And then, just like that, she was gone.</p><p>Agatha pulled into her driveway just past 2 a.m., the house dark and quiet.</p><p>She slipped off her heels as she stepped inside, sighing at the relief. The night had been… a lot.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how she felt.</p><p>She liked Rio. Really liked her. That much was clear. But that didn’t mean she could trust her.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>She exhaled slowly, making her way upstairs.</p><p>First, she peeked into Storey’s crib. The baby was fast asleep, curled into her stuffed rabbit, her tiny fingers twitching slightly as she dreamed. Agatha smoothed a gentle hand over her curls before moving to Nicholas’ room.</p><p>He was sprawled out in bed, his dinosaurs lined up in a neat row beside him, his chest rising and falling in steady little breaths.</p><p>She bent down, brushing a light kiss over his forehead.</p><p>Only after checking on them did she stop by the guest room, peeking in to find Sharon asleep as well, curled beneath the thick cashmere throw Agatha had given her for Christmas.</p><p>Everything was fine.</p><p>Her world was still intact.</p><p>So why did she feel like she was waiting for something to go wrong?</p><p>She shook the thought away, slipped into her own bedroom, and changed quickly before climbing into bed.</p><p>She pulled the covers up, exhaling slowly. She was home. She was fine.</p><p>And yet, as she stared at the ceiling, she couldn’t shake the lingering warmth of Rio’s hands on her skin.</p>

<p>Over the next few weeks, Rio and Agatha settled into something steady, something real, building solid foundations after their small blip at New Years.</p><p>They weren’t rushing. There were no grand declarations, no over-the-top gestures. But there were dates, dinners at cozy little restaurants, long walks through the park with coffee in hand, even a night at an art gallery where Rio had teased Agatha mercilessly about her serious approach to modern art.</p><p>“It’s just a red square.”</p><p>“It’s a statement, Rio.”</p><p>“The statement is that the artist ran out of ideas.”</p><p>Agatha had sighed, but her lips had twitched.</p><p>Each time they saw each other, Agatha let her guard down a little more.</p><p>And Rio?</p><p>Rio was falling. Hard. She didn’t say it, yet, but she felt it in the way she found herself looking forward to their dates with a kind of nervous excitement she hadn’t felt in years. In the way she kept catching herself staring at her phone, waiting for Agatha’s name to pop up. In the way she’d started thinking of Agatha when she wasn’t around, wondering how her day had gone, how the kids were doing, whether she’d gotten enough sleep the night before.</p><p>And then, one night, as they sat at a small wine bar tucked away in the city, Agatha sighed, swirling the last of her wine in her glass.</p><p>“Sharon’s spa trip is coming up,” she said.</p><p>Rio raised a brow. “The one you forced on her?”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “She needed it and she deserves it.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “And you’re bracing yourself for a week of single-parent life?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a look. “I always am a single parent.”</p><p>“You know what I mean.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled. “It’s just… she’s a huge help. I’m not worried, I just know my hands will be full. So if I’m a little MIA next week, that’s why.”</p><p>Rio hesitated.</p><p>Then, before she could talk herself out of it, she leaned forward slightly.</p><p>“What if I came over?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “What?”</p><p>“Not to—” Rio hesitated, then tried again. “Not in a weird way, I just… I could come by one night. Bring food. Keep you company.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows furrowed slightly, and Rio braced herself for the no. But then, to her surprise, Agatha’s expression softened.</p><p>She didn’t say yes right away, but she also didn’t immediately shut it down.</p><p>And that?</p><p>That was progress.</p><p>The week of Sharons spa trip, Rio arrived at Agatha’s house just after six, a bag of takeout in one hand and a bottle of wine in the other. She was nervous to be here when the kids were awake.</p><p>And yet, the moment she stepped inside, the neeves faded into the background.</p><p>Because Agatha, in her dark-wash jeans and off-the-shoulder sweater, was kneeling on the floor with Storey perched on her hip and Nicholas bouncing on the couch, chattering excitedly about his dinosaur puzzle.</p><p>The picture was so normal. So soft. So Agatha.</p><p>“Rio!” Nicholas beamed, jumping down and running to her, hugging her legs before she could even react.</p><p>Rio grinned, ruffling his curls. “Hey, buddy.”</p><p>Agatha stood, shifting Storey against her, her eyes warm. “You brought food with you?”</p><p>“I was told there would be no cooking tonight,” Rio teased, lifting the takeout bag.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha sighed dramatically. “I’ve survived off of fruit snacks and leftover grilled cheese all day.”</p><p>Rio chuckled as Nicholas took her hand, like he’d done it hundreds of times before, already pulling her toward the kitchen, talking a mile a minute.</p><p>She wasn’t used to this.</p><p>She wasn’t used to kids outside of work. She had spent her entire career treating them, comforting them, making sure they left the hospital healthier than when they arrived. But that was different. That was clinical.</p><p>This? This was real life.</p><p>And as the evening unfolded, Rio found herself watching Agatha in a way she never had opportunity to before.</p><p>She watched as Agatha balanced Storey on her hip while fixing Nicholas a plate, managing to dodge his endless questions and his fidgeting with effortless patience.</p><p>She watched as Agatha sat beside him at the table, cutting his food into smaller bites, her own meal forgotten as she helped him with his juice box and listened intently to his detailed theories about which dinosaur was the strongest.</p><p>She watched as, after dinner, Agatha gathered up pajamas for both kids, running through her nightly routine with a rhythm that was second nature.</p><p>Rio leaned against the doorway, arms crossed, as Nicholas chattered away in the bathtub, his toys floating around him.</p><p>Agatha sat on the edge, her sleeves rolled up, one hand keeping Storey steady as she peeked over the tub, her tiny hands splashing in the water.</p><p>“How are you not exhausted?” Rio murmured, marveling.</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet laugh, brushing damp curls from Storey’s face. “Oh, I am. But you just… do it.”</p><p>Nicholas held up a plastic shark. “Mama, look! It’s eating the boat!”</p><p>Agatha gasped in mock horror. “Oh no! What will we do?”</p><p>“Run away!” Nicholas shouted, making the shark dive under the water.</p><p>Rio smiled, feeling a strange warmth spread through her chest.</p><p>This was what had scared her months before. The sheer magnitude of it. Not just the kids themselves, but the responsibility, the depth of love it required.</p><p>But watching Agatha now—watching her kiss Nicholas’ forehead as she wrapped him in a towel, watching her rock Storey in her arms, whispering soft, soothing words as the baby began to fuss—Rio realized something.</p><p>It wasn’t scary. It was extraordinary.</p><p>By the time Nicholas was tucked into bed, wiggling happily under his blankets as Agatha read him a bedtime story, Rio was fully gone. Fully committed, fully in love.</p><p>She leaned against the wall, watching as Agatha’s voice softened, her fingers brushing through Nicholas’ hair as his eyes began to droop.</p><p>She had seen her sharp. She had seen her guarded. She had seen her confident and in control.</p><p>But this?</p><p>This was love in its purest form.</p><p>And Rio knew, without a doubt, that she was falling hopelessly, irreversibly in love with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>By the time Agatha finally slipped into bed after settling Storey again, Rio was already stretched out against the crisp white sheets, watching her.</p><p>The house was silent, the kids asleep in their rooms, and for the first time all evening, Agatha let out a slow breath and relaxed.</p><p>“You’re staring,” she murmured self consciously, sliding under the covers.</p><p>Rio smirked. “Am I?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a knowing look, reaching up to pull the tie from her hair, letting soft waves tumble over her shoulders. Rio had the sudden urge to run her fingers through it, but instead, she simply watched as Agatha turned onto her side, propping herself up on one elbow.</p><p>“I was just thinking,” Rio said, voice softer now.</p><p>“Dangerous.”</p><p>Rio chuckled, then reached out, brushing her knuckles gently along Agatha’s arm. “I think you’re kind of amazing.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh. “Tell that to my three-day-old laundry pile.”</p><p>“I mean it,” Rio murmured. “I don’t know how you do it all. You make it look easy.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, shaking her head. “It’s not easy. It’s exhausting. It’s overwhelming sometimes. But it’s—” She hesitated, then met Rio’s gaze. “It’s worth it.”</p><p>Rio felt something shift in her chest. A quiet, certain ache.</p><p>She reached out, brushing a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear, and then leaned in, pressing a slow, lingering kiss to her lips.</p><p>Agatha sighed into it, her hand sliding up Rio’s side, pulling her closer. The warmth between them deepened, slow and steady, no urgency, just real.</p><p>They made love that night, wrapped up in soft sheets, tangled together in the low glow of the bedside lamp. It wasn’t rushed. It wasn’t frantic. It was intentional, a slow unraveling, a silent promise that they were here together - that Rio had seen her routine and hadn’t run this time.</p><p>And when they finally drifted to sleep, Rio found herself thinking, I could get used to this.</p><p>Sometime in the night, Rio woke to the feeling of movement beside her.</p><p>She blinked, adjusting to the dim light, and then realized a little body had wormed its way between them.</p><p>Nicholas.</p><p>He was curled against Agatha’s side, his small hand gripping the fabric of her silky pajama top, his face tucked against her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha, still half-asleep, murmured something soft, her arm automatically wrapping around him.</p><p>Rio’s heart squeezed.</p><p>She had seen plenty of kids wake up scared in the hospital—seen their little faces streaked with tears, their hands grasping for comfort. But this was different.</p><p>This was home.</p><p>Agatha cracked one eye open, meeting Rio’s gaze with a tired but knowing look.</p><p>“Nightmare?” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha nodded, her voice thick with sleep. “Happens sometimes.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for only a second before shifting closer, brushing her hand over Nicholas’ curls gently. The little boy barely stirred, his breathing even.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened. Rio hadn’t run this time. She was here.</p><p>And as she settled back against the pillows, listening to the soft rhythm of Agatha’s breath, of Nicholas’ quiet little sighs, Rio realized, no matter what happened next, she would never run away from this ever again.</p>

<p>Agatha woke to the golden glow of early morning spilling through the curtains, casting soft shadows across the room. The bed was warm, tangled in the weight of sleep and the presence of the two bodies beside her.</p><p>Nicholas was still curled against her, his tiny chest rising and falling in the steady rhythm of deep sleep. His little fingers were loosely tangled in the fabric of her nightshirt, as if even in sleep, he wanted to make sure she was still there.</p><p>And then there was Rio.</p><p>Agatha turned her head slightly, her gaze landing on the woman beside her. Rio was awake, lying on her side, propped up on one elbow, watching them with an expression Agatha couldn’t quite place.</p><p>Something soft. Something wondering. For a long moment, neither of them spoke.</p><p>Then Rio’s lips curved into a sleepy, lopsided smile. “Morning.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, her fingers lightly brushing over Nicholas’ back in soothing circles. “Morning.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked down to the little boy still nestled against Agatha. “He sleeps like a rock.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet chuckle. “Not always. But once he’s out, he’s out.”</p><p>Rio shifted, careful not to jostle them too much, her fingers absently toying with the edge of the comforter. “Does he crawl into bed with you a lot?”</p><p>“Not often, not as much as he used to,” Agatha admitted, watching the slow rise and fall of Nicholas’ breath. “Mostly when he has bad dreams.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a second before reaching out, brushing a stray strand of hair from Nicholas’ forehead. The motion was so gentle, so natural, that Agatha felt something deep in her chest tighten.</p><p>It wasn’t just that Rio was good with kids, Agatha had always known that. It was that Rio, despite all her initial doubts, her cold feet, she was here.</p><p>She hadn’t made an excuse and left in the middle of the night. She hadn’t shied away when Nicholas had clambered between them.</p><p>She had stayed.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, willing herself not to overthink it. Instead, she nudged Nicholas gently. “Time to wake up, sweetheart.”</p><p>Nicholas stirred, letting out a little sigh before his eyes cracked open. He blinked sleepily at Rio, then yawned dramatically. “Riiiooo,” he mumbled, half-awake.</p><p>Rio smiled. “That’s me.”</p><p>Nicholas rubbed his eyes before sitting up, looking around. His little brows furrowed. “Wait… did I sleep in Mama’s bed?”</p><p>Agatha smoothed his messy curls. “You had a bad dream, remember?”</p><p>Nicholas considered that, then nodded solemnly. “It was not a good dream.”</p><p>“No?” Rio asked. “What was it about?”</p><p>Nicholas twisted the edge of the blanket between his fingers. “There was a big storm, and it made all the dinosaurs in my backyard fly away.”</p><p>Rio gasped in mock horror. “Not the dinosaurs!”</p><p>Nicholas nodded gravely. “Even T-Rex.”</p><p>“That’s tragic,” Rio said. “But you know what? If your dinosaurs ever really flew away, I bet we could find them.”</p><p>Nicholas tilted his head. “How?”</p><p>Rio pretended to think. “Maybe with a dinosaur tracker.”</p><p>Nicholas gasped. “Do those exist?”</p><p>“Hmm… maybe not yet,” Rio said. “But if they did, I bet your mama would buy you one.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled. “Maybe.”</p><p>Nicholas grinned, seemingly satisfied with this answer, and flopped dramatically onto Agatha’s lap. “I’m still sleepy.”</p><p>“You, my love, are always sleepy,” Agatha teased, tickling his side.</p><p>Nicholas squealed, wriggling away, before suddenly seeming to remember something. His eyes lit up. “Is Storey awake?”</p><p>As if on cue, the faint sound of baby babbling ‘mama mama’ filtered through the monitor on Agatha’s nightstand.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I guess that answers that.”</p><p>Nicholas scrambled off the bed. “I’ll go say good morning!”</p><p>“Be gentle with her,” Agatha called as he dashed out the door, his bare feet pattering against the hardwood floor.</p><p>The room felt quieter without him, though not in an uncomfortable way. Agatha turned back to Rio, who was watching her with a soft, unreadable expression.</p><p>“What?” Agatha asked, suddenly self-conscious.</p><p>Rio shook her head, a small smile playing at her lips. “Nothing.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “That look didn’t look like nothing.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then exhaled, running a hand through her sleep-mussed hair. “I just… I get it now.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Get what?”</p><p>“This,” Rio said, gesturing vaguely to the space between them. “Why you guard your life so carefully. Why you don’t let people in easily.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted. “Rio—”</p><p>“No, just—” Rio reached out, taking Agatha’s hand. “I understand why this scared me. Because it’s big. It’s not just dating. It’s you, and Nicholas, and Storey, and all the love that comes with it. And I think… I think I was afraid of messing it up.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened.</p><p>She wanted to tell Rio that she had messed up. That she had run, just like Agatha had expected her to.</p><p>But the way Rio was looking at her now… it wasn’t the same hesitance from before.</p><p>It was something else.</p><p>Something determined.</p><p>“I don’t expect you to have everything figured out,” Agatha said after a moment, her voice quieter now. “I just… I need to know that you’re in this. That you’re not going to panic and run the second it feels too real again.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand. “I am in this, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha searched her face, looking for any trace of doubt.</p><p>She didn’t find any.</p><p>Before she could say anything else, a distant thud echoed from down the hall, followed by Nicholas’ excited squeal and Storey’s delighted baby giggles.</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Sounds like we should probably go rescue her.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a laugh. “Yeah, before Nicholas teaches her how to climb out of the crib.”</p><p>They climbed out of bed, making their way down the hall.</p><p>And as Agatha watched Rio duck into Storey’s nursery, scooping the baby up with practiced ease, she felt something shift inside her.</p><p>Maybe, just maybe, Rio wouldn’t run this time.</p><p>The scent of fresh coffee and sizzling bacon filled the kitchen as Agatha moved efficiently between the stove and the counter, flipping pancakes while keeping a watchful eye on Nicholas, who was carefully setting the table. Storey sat in her high chair, chubby fists banging against the tray as she babbled happily, her dark curls a wild mess from sleep.</p><p>Rio sat back, watching the scene unfold. The warmth of it all settled deep in her chest.</p><p>“You just gonna sit there, or are you going to help?” Agatha teased, glancing over her shoulder with a smirk.</p><p>Rio pushed off the chair, walking over to where Nicholas was struggling with a stack of plates. “Here, buddy, let me help with that.”</p><p>Nicholas beamed up at her. “I got it, but you can do the cups!”</p><p>“Deal.”</p><p>As Rio moved to grab the cups, she glanced over at Agatha, who was now buttering a stack of golden pancakes, carefully cutting one into smaller pieces for Storey.</p><p>“This is impressive,” Rio admitted, nodding toward the spread. “You do this every morning?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, shaking her head. “Not always. Some mornings it’s just cereal and fruit, but I figured I’d make something nice today since we had company.”</p><p>Rio slid into a seat beside Nicholas as Agatha brought everything to the table, setting Storey’s plate down first before taking her own seat.</p><p>“So,” Agatha began as she poured syrup onto her pancakes. “I’ll be working from home this week while Sharon is at the spa.”</p><p>Nicholas perked up. “Does that mean you won’t have to go to work?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, ruffling his hair. “Nope, I’ll be right here with you two.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow. “You work from home a lot?”</p><p>“I can when I need to,” Agatha replied, cutting into her food. “It’s one of the perks of running my own business. I try to schedule things around the kids as much as possible.”</p><p>Rio nodded thoughtfully. “Must be nice,” Rio mused. “Being able to just shift things around when needed.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a knowing look. “Your schedule isn’t that flexible, I know.”</p><p>Rio sighed, taking a sip of her coffee. “Not exactly. Hospital shifts aren’t easy to change, and being in pediatrics means there’s always something coming up. Sick kids don’t wait for convenient hours.”</p><p>Nicholas looked up from his plate, tilting his head. “You help sick kids?”</p><p>Rio smiled at him. “I do. I’m a doctor.”</p><p>His eyes widened. “That’s so cool.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “It can be. But it can also be really busy.”</p><p>Nicholas nodded, clearly impressed. “Maybe I’ll be a doctor too.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “You just want to be everything, don’t you?”</p><p>Nicholas grinned, stuffing another bite of pancake into his mouth.</p><p>The conversation drifted to lighter topics, Storey making happy little noises as she squished pieces of pancake in her tiny fists. The whole morning felt easy and Rio found herself sinking into it, enjoying the warmth of being included in something that felt so… settled.</p><p>Before she knew it, it was time for her to leave. She pushed back from the table, finishing off the last of her coffee. “I should head out.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, standing as well. “You working a full shift today?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio sighed. “Should be done by late evening.”</p><p>Nicholas hopped down from his chair. “You should come back after!”</p><p>Agatha shot Rio an amused look before kneeling down to kiss Nicholas’ cheek before ruffling his hair. “Sweetheart, Rio has her own place. She probably wants to go home and sleep after work without troublesome little boys bothering her.”</p><p>Nicholas pouted. “But she could sleep here again!”</p><p>Rio chuckled, ruffling his hair too, laughing as he swatted her hand away. “Maybe another night, bud.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a knowing look as she walked her to the door. Once they were out of earshot, she smirked. “Look at that—you’re already a fan favorite.”</p><p>Rio smiled, but something in her chest tightened as she pulled on her coat.</p><p>She wanted that. Wanted to come back after her shift, to slip into this life a little more. She just hadn’t realized how much until now.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “What?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, covering the thought with a small smile. “Nothing. Just… thanks for breakfast.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes fondly. “You helped.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a second before leaning in, pressing a lingering kiss to Agatha’s lips. “I’ll call you later, when I get a break...”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I’ll believe it when I see it, Doctor Vidal.”</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head as she stepped out the door. But as she walked to her car, she realized something.</p><p>She would call.  She’d make the time. Because as much as she’d been afraid of all this before… she wanted more mornings like this.</p>

<p>A few days passed in an easy rhythm. Agatha was busy working from home while managing Nicholas and Storey, and Rio juggled her long shifts at the hospital. But despite their packed schedules, they stayed connected, texting throughout the day, stealing moments to FaceTime late at night when the kids were asleep and Rio was home from work.</p><p>It felt natural.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure if she’d expected Rio to drift away again, but she hadn’t. If anything, Rio was making an effort, and that unsettled something in Agatha’s chest, something that felt too much like hope.</p><p>On Thursday evening, as Agatha curled up on her couch with a glass of wine, her phone lit up with a call. Rio.</p><p>“Hey,” she answered, tucking her legs beneath her.</p><p>“Hey, beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Flattery already? What do you want?”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Can’t I just call because I miss you?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha teased, swirling her wine in her glass. “But I have a feeling there’s something else.”</p><p>“Well,” Rio admitted, “I was thinking, we should do something different for our next date.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “Different how?”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then said, “I want to take you and the kids somewhere.”</p><p>That gave Agatha pause.</p><p>She shifted the phone slightly, sitting up. “You want to go on a date with all three of us?”</p><p>Rio exhaled a soft laugh. “Yeah. I do.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened slightly around her glass. This was new. Big. Rio had spent time with the kids the other night, but this was the first time she was actively planning something with them in mind.</p><p>“You don’t have to force yourself,” Agatha said carefully. “I know this isn’t what you’re used to.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio admitted. “But I want to. I know I messed up before, and I get why you’re hesitant. But I really, really like you, Agatha. And your kids… they’re kind of amazing.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest ached. She wanted to believe that, wanted to believe Rio, but she’d spent so long guarding herself that lowering those walls wasn’t easy.</p><p>Still wasn’t this what she wanted?</p><p>After a beat, she asked, “Where were you thinking?”</p><p>“Well, that depends.” Rio’s voice was warm, hopeful. “Do the kids like animals?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled. “Nicholas is obsessed with animals.”</p><p>“Perfect,” Rio said. “I was thinking we could go to the wildlife park on Sunday. It’s got a petting zoo, some interactive exhibits—figured it might be fun.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated for a moment longer, then finally let herself smile. “You know what? That actually sounds perfect.”</p><p>“So it’s a date?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile deepened. “It’s a date.”</p><p>Rio let out a small, triumphant hum. “Great. I’ll text you the details.”</p><p>As they talked a little longer, Agatha found herself relaxing again, warmth spreading through her chest. Maybe she was still wary. Maybe she still had her moments of doubt.</p><p>But for now?</p><p>She was willing to see where this went.</p><p>Sunday morning arrived crisp and clear, the winter air biting but not unbearable. Agatha dressed both Nicholas and Storey in warm layers, Nicholas in his favorite blue coat and matching beanie, and Storey in a fluffy cream-colored jumpsuit that made her look like a tiny bear.</p><p>She herself opted for a chic but practical outfit: a long, camel-colored wool coat over a cashmere sweater and black leggings, paired with knee-high leather boots. Her hair was swept into a sleek low ponytail, and she kept her makeup soft and natural.</p><p>Rio pulled up to the house in her SUV, stepping out with a bright smile. She looked effortlessly good, dressed in a dark green puffer jacket, jeans, and sturdy boots, her dark hair loosely curled under a beanie. She greeted them all warmly, her eyes softening when she saw Storey bundled up in Agatha’s arms.</p><p>“Hey, you,” Rio murmured, brushing a kiss to Agatha’s cheek before turning to Nicholas. “You ready for some animals, bud?”</p><p>Nicholas grinned. “I can’t wait! Are there lions?”</p><p>Rio chuckled, opening the car door for them. “No lions, but they do have wolves. And otters. And a petting zoo.”</p><p>Nicholas gasped, bouncing on his feet. “A petting zoo?! Mama, did you hear that?”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “I did, sweetheart. Let’s get going before you explode from excitement.”</p><p>They buckled into Agathas car, Nicholas chattering animatedly from his booster seat in the back while Storey sat beside him, in her car seat. The drive was smooth, and Rio kept the conversation light, asking Nicholas about his favorite animals and telling him stories from her childhood visits to similar parks.</p><p>When they arrived, the wildlife park was bustling but not overcrowded, and the air was filled with the mingling scents of pine trees, damp earth, and something distinctly barnyard.</p><p>Rio paid for their tickets, waving Agatha off when she reached for her wallet. “I asked you guys on this date,” she said with a smirk. “I’ve got it.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but let it slide, watching as Rio easily took Nicholas’ hand and led him toward the entrance, pointing out the giant wooden map of the park as Agatha followed behind with Storey in her rarely used pushchair.</p><p>“Alright, little man, where should we go first?”</p><p>Nicholas studied the map with the seriousness of a general planning a battle. “Wolves,” he declared.</p><p>“Wolves it is,” Rio said, glancing at Agatha with a small smile.</p><p>They walked at a leisurely pace, Nicholas practically bouncing with excitement while Storey sat back being pushed along by Agatha, wide-eyed as she took in the new sights. The wolf enclosure was expansive, with thick pine trees and rock formations mimicking their natural habitat. A few wolves lazed in the sun while others prowled the perimeter.</p><p>“Whoa,” Nicholas breathed, pressing his hands against the glass viewing area.</p><p>Rio crouched beside him. “Did you know wolves have a super strong sense of smell? They can smell their prey from miles away.”</p><p>Nicholas’ eyes widened. “That’s so cool! Can they smell us?”</p><p>“Probably,” Rio said with a grin. “But I think they’re more interested in their lunch.”</p><p>Agatha watched them interact, warmth blooming in her chest. Rio was so good with Nicholas—patient, engaging, genuinely interested in his excitement. It was a stark contrast to the nervousness she’d shown those months ago at Wanda’s party, and it made Agatha wonder just how much had changed in Rio’s mind since then.</p><p>They spent the next couple of hours exploring different exhibits—the otters, which Nicholas loved; the snowy owls, which had Storey staring in fascination; and the deer enclosure, where Rio lifted Nicholas up so he could see better.</p><p>When they reached the petting zoo, Nicholas practically vibrated with excitement.</p><p>“Can I feed them?” he asked, eyes huge.</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said, handing over a small cup of feed they’d purchased at the entrance.</p><p>Rio laughed as Nicholas carefully approached a group of friendly goats, holding out his hand as one of them eagerly licked the food from his palm.</p><p>“Ew! It’s so slimy!” Nicholas giggled, wiping his hand on his coat.</p><p>Storey, now nestled in Agatha’s arms, let out a delighted squeal as a small, fluffy rabbit was brought out by one of the staff members. The worker offered to let her touch it, and Agatha carefully guided Storey’s tiny hand to the rabbit’s soft fur.</p><p>“She likes it,” Rio observed, standing close beside them.</p><p>Agatha smiled down at Storey, who was staring in wonder. “She does.”</p><p>Rio watched them for a moment before murmuring, “You’re really amazing with them, you know.”</p><p>Agatha glanced up, meeting Rio’s gaze. “It’s my job,” she said lightly.</p><p>“It’s more than that,” Rio countered. “You’re an amazing mom.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened at the sincerity in Rio’s voice.</p><p>Before she could reply, Nicholas tugged on Rio’s sleeve. “Can we get ice cream now?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Ice cream in winter?”</p><p>Nicholas gave her a look. “There’s never a bad time for ice cream.”</p><p>Agatha snorted. “He’s not wrong.”</p><p>So they found a café near the entrance, where they warmed up with hot chocolate and, yes, ice cream—Nicholas happily munching on a chocolate cone while Storey made a mess of her tiny spoonfuls.</p><p>Rio sat beside Agatha, her knee brushing against hers under the table. “This was fun,” she said, voice soft.</p><p>Agatha looked over at her, something in her chest loosening. “Yeah,” she admitted. “It really was.”</p><p>As the day wound down and they made their way back to the car, Nicholas sleepily leaned against Rio, clearly worn out from the excitement. Storey had already dozed off in Agatha’s arms.</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha as she started the car. “Maybe we could do this again sometime?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then smiled. “Yeah. I’d like that.”</p><p>Rio simply smiled in response.</p>

<p>The weeks that followed their wildlife park date brought a shift in Rio and Agatha’s relationship. What had started as hesitant steps toward something deeper, more permanent, quickly became more natural, more constant. Rio found herself at Agatha’s house more often, sometimes invited, sometimes simply showing up with takeout after a long shift, knowing Agatha was juggling both work and the kids once home.</p><p>She fell into their rhythm without even realizing it.</p><p>She’d come over and let Nicholas excitedly show her his latest drawings or listen as he rattled off facts about dinosaurs, his main obsession. Storey, ever curious, had taken to reaching for Rio whenever she was near, her tiny fingers grabbing at her necklaces, her hair, the buttons on her shirt.</p><p>And Agatha, Agatha, was letting her in, fully and completely.</p><p>One Saturday, Rio arrived just as Agatha was finishing up dinner. The house smelled incredible, the scent of garlic and roasted herbs filling the air.</p><p>“You cooked again?” Rio teased, leaning against the counter, enraptured by the sight of her doing something so casual.</p><p>Agatha smirked, flipping a pan of asparagus with expert ease. “Shocking, I know.”</p><p>“I was starting to think you secretly ordered from Michelin-starred restaurants and passed it off as yours every time I come over.”</p><p>“I have layers,” Agatha said, turning off the stove and wiping her hands on a dish towel.</p><p>Rio stepped closer, sliding her arms around Agatha’s waist. “Mmm. I like discovering them.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t pull away. “Charm will only get you so far, Doctor.”</p><p>“Good thing I have other skills,” Rio murmured, pressing a soft kiss to her neck.</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Nicholas ran into the kitchen, skidding to a stop. “Are you staying for dinner, Rio?”</p><p>Rio glanced at Agatha, who arched a brow as if to say your call.</p><p>“Yeah, bud,” Rio said, smiling. “I’d love to.”</p><p>Dinner was chaotic in the best way. Nicholas talked a mile a minute between bites, excitedly telling Rio about a science experiment he’d done at school. Storey smacked her hands on her high chair tray, giggling when Rio made silly faces at her from across the table.</p><p>And Agatha watched it all unfold with something soft and unreadable in her eyes.</p><p>After dinner, Rio actually helped with bath time, carefully balancing Storey on her hip as Agatha got Nicholas settled in the tub. The routine was seamless, a well-practiced rhythm that Rio found herself slipping into with ease.</p><p>By the time both kids were asleep, Rio and Agatha collapsed onto the couch, a glass of wine in each of their hands.</p><p>“You really don’t have to keep helping with them every time your here you know,” Agatha said, though there was no bite in her voice.</p><p>Rio turned to face her. “I want to.”</p><p>Agatha studied her for a long moment before looking away. “It’s just…a lot. I know it’s a lot.”</p><p>“I knew what I was getting into,” Rio said gently. “And I’m still here.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, swirling her wine in her glass. “For now.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Agatha—”</p><p>“I’m not saying that to be cruel,” Agatha interrupted, voice softer now. “I just… I don’t want them getting too attached for you to disappear in the future. ”</p><p>Rio reached out, taking Agatha’s free hand in hers. “I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha searched her face, something fragile in her expression. Then, finally, she let out a breath and squeezed Rio’s hand.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered.</p><p>And Rio silently vowed to prove it to her every single day.</p><p>As the weeks went on, Rio became a fixture in their lives.</p><p>She was there for Saturday morning pancakes, letting Nicholas help mix the batter while Storey crawled around. She was there for lazy Sunday afternoons, curled up on the couch with Agatha, watching Disney movies with the kids.</p><p>One evening, she arrived at Agatha’s house after a long shift at the hospital, exhausted but happy to be there.</p><p>She found Nicholas sitting at the dining table, a serious look on his face as he scribbled something on a piece of paper.</p><p>“What are you working on, bud?” Rio asked, setting her bag down.</p><p>Nicholas looked up and grinned. “A list.”</p><p>Rio leaned over, reading the crayon-written words.</p><p>Things That Make a Family</p><p>Mama<br/>Storey<br/>Sharon<br/>Rio</p><p>Her heart clenched. “That’s a great list.”</p><p>“Yeah!” Nicholas said enthusiastically. “Mama said family can be more than just who you’re born to. It’s who’s there for you.”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, her throat tight.</p><p>Agatha walked in at that moment, pausing as she saw the look on Rio’s face. “Everything okay?”</p><p>Rio turned to her, something shifting inside her.</p><p>Yeah. Everything was more than okay. She was in love—not just with Agatha, but with all of them.</p><p>It was a quiet evening at Agatha’s house, one of those rare moments where everything felt soft and easy. The scent of something sweet lingered in the air—Nicholas and Rio had spent the afternoon baking cookies under Agatha’s amused supervision. Now, Nicholas was curled up on the couch, half-watching a cartoon, his head resting against Rio’s side as she absentmindedly ran her fingers through his hair.</p><p>Storey sat on the floor in the soft rug, happily occupied with a plush elephant, occasionally babbling in that sweet, nonsensical way that made Agatha’s heart melt every time.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the doorframe, sipping her tea, just watching them. This was a version of her life she hadn’t expected. A version where Rio was not just a visitor but a presence, a part of their routine, slipping into their world as if she had always belonged there.</p><p>And then it happened.</p><p>One moment, Storey was reaching for her elephant, and the next, she was pushing up onto her feet, her little face scrunching in concentration.</p><p>Rio tensed beside Nicholas, her eyes locked on the baby. “Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha had already set her mug down, her pulse kicking up. “Oh my God—”</p><p>Storey let go of the toy, wobbling for a second. And then, as if deciding she could, she took a step. Then another.</p><p>A breathless laugh escaped Agatha before she even realized she’d made a sound. “Storey!”</p><p>The baby took one more shaky step before landing on her bottom with a soft thud. She blinked in surprise, as if even she wasn’t sure how she’d done it.</p><p>Agatha was across the room in an instant, scooping her up and spinning her around, laughing in pure joy. “You did it! My baby girl, you did it!”</p><p>Storey let out a delighted squeal, wrapping her chubby arms around her mother’s neck.</p><p>Nicky jumped off the couch. “She walked!” he shrieked, hopping up and down.</p><p>Rio was still sitting, frozen in place, her gaze fixed on the little girl in Agatha’s arms. And then, much to her own surprise, a strange, unfamiliar warmth bloomed in her chest.</p><p>Pride.</p><p>Not the detached, professional kind she felt at the hospital when one of her patients reached a milestone. Not the secondhand joy she experienced watching other parents celebrate their children.</p><p>This was different. This was personal.</p><p>She stood slowly, watching Agatha press kisses all over Storey’s face, her joy so bright, so effortless.</p><p>And Rio felt it, the magnitude of the moment. She was here. She was part of this.</p><p>Nicholas tugged on her sleeve, his face alight. “Did you see her, Rio?”</p><p>Rio let out a breathless chuckle, crouching down to meet his excitement. “I saw her, bud. That was amazing.”</p><p>Nicholas beamed. “She’s gonna walk all over the place now.”</p><p>Agatha turned then, her smile still so wide it nearly undid Rio. “She did it,” she said softly, as if she still couldn’t believe it.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard, then nodded. “Yeah,” she murmured. “She really did.”</p><p>And as she looked at Agatha, still glowing with pride, holding her baby girl like she was the most precious thing in the world, Rio knew would hold onto this moment for the rest of her life.</p><p>A few days had passed since Storey’s first steps, and Rio still hadn’t quite shaken the feeling it left her with. It wasn’t just pride—it was something deeper. Something terrifying in its intensity.</p><p>And now, she was about to meet Sharon. The infamous Sharon.  Who she had missed each time she’d been over.</p><p>Agatha had spoken about her often—the woman who had been there through everything, who had helped her navigate single motherhood, who loved Nicholas and Storey like her own. And if the way Nicholas spoke about her was any indication, Sharon was just as protective of Agatha as she was of the kids.</p><p>Which was why Rio wasn’t entirely shocked when the first thing Sharon did upon meeting her was squint.</p><p>It was a chilly Saturday morning, and Rio had been invited over for breakfast—a casual gathering, just them, the kids, and Sharon.</p><p>Sharon, who stood in the kitchen, stirring something on the stove while sizing Rio up like she was a suspect in an interrogation.</p><p>Nicholas had already taken his spot beside Rio at the table, chatting about everything from school to superheroes, completely oblivious to the silent scrutiny happening behind him.</p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, was very much aware of it.</p><p>She set a stack of plates on the counter, then glanced between them. “Sharon, don’t scare her off,” she said lightly, but there was an edge of amusement in her voice.</p><p>Sharon didn’t look away from Rio as she finally spoke. “Not trying to scare her off. Just trying to get a read on her.”</p><p>Rio, to her credit, didn’t flinch. Instead, she took a sip of her coffee and met Sharon’s gaze head-on. “And?”</p><p>Sharon’s lips quirked slightly. “TBD.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Oh my God.”</p><p>Sharon finally turned back to the stove, stirring with practiced ease. “I like that you’re a doctor,” she said after a beat. “I don’t like that Agatha seemed upset after New Year’s.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, setting her mug down carefully. “I messed up,” she admitted. “I got scared.”</p><p>Sharon nodded as if she expected the answer. “And what’s different now?”</p><p>Rio exhaled, glancing at Agatha—who was studiously not interfering, watching the exchange with mild curiosity.</p><p>Then she looked at Nicholas, who was now staring at Storey, who sat in her high chair, babbling, humming to himself, perfectly content in Rio’s presence.</p><p>And finally, back at Sharon. “I realized I don’t want to be scared,” she said honestly. “I want to be here.”</p><p>Sharon studied her for a long moment, then nodded. “Good.”</p><p>And just like that, she turned off the stove, plated some eggs, and slid them across the counter toward Agatha.</p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh. “That’s it? No dramatic warnings?”</p><p>Sharon arched a brow. “I already gave the warning.” She finally smirked at Rio. “Now I just get to see if she listens.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but smile. “Fair enough.”</p><p>And somehow, just like that, the air in the room felt lighter.</p><p>Soon, she could tell Agatha exactly how she felt about her.</p>

<p>Agatha had been under the weather the last few days, fighting the beginning stages of a chest infection.</p><p>The first sign that something was wrong with the other occupants of the house came in the middle of the night.</p><p>Agatha was jolted awake by a tiny voice calling out, followed by the unmistakable sound of retching.</p><p>She was out of bed in an instant, heart pounding as she rushed down the hall to Nicholas’s room, bare feet slapping against the wooden flooring. She found him sitting up in bed, his small body trembling, his Dinosaur pajama shirt damp with sweat.</p><p>“Mama,” he whimpered, clutching his stomach. “I don’t feel good.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. She crouched beside him, brushing his damp curls back. “Oh, baby,” she murmured. “It’s okay, I’ve got you.”</p><p>Nicholas barely had time to groan before he lurched forward. Agatha grabbed the small waste bin from beside his bed just in time, holding it steady as he threw up again.</p><p>Her heart clenched at the pitiful sound of his misery. “Shh, sweetheart, I know. I know it’s awful.” She rubbed slow, soothing circles over his back.</p><p>Once he was done, she wiped his mouth gently with a cool cloth and helped him out of his soiled pajamas, swapping them for a fresh set.</p><p>Nicholas sagged against her, exhausted. “I don’t like this,” he mumbled.</p><p>“I know, love,” she whispered, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Let’s get you comfy, okay? You can sleep in my room tonight.”</p><p>She had just managed to settle him in her bed with a glass of water and a cool rag on his forehead when she heard another cry—this time from Storey’s nursery.</p><p>A sharp pang of dread shot through her.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Moving quickly, she made her way to Storey’s crib, only to find her baby girl lying in a miserable tangle of blankets, her little face flushed red, her curls also damp with sweat. The acrid scent of vomit filled the air.</p><p>“Sweetheart,” Agatha breathed, her stomach twisting. Storey let out a weak, pitiful whimper, reaching for her.</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched as she scooped her up. Storey sagged against her chest, her body radiating too much heat.</p><p>Oh God.</p><p>She rocked her gently, pressing her lips to her daughter’s temple. Too warm. Much too warm.</p><p>It was one thing for Nicholas to be sick—he was old enough to tell her how he felt. But Storey? Storey was still so little, still helpless in so many ways.</p><p>And Agatha knew stomach bugs could hit babies hard.</p><p>She carried Storey into her own room, where Nicholas was curled up under the blankets. The moment he saw his sister, his sleepy eyes widened. “Is Storey sick too?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, voice tight. “Yeah, baby. She’s not feeling good either.”</p><p>She sat on the edge of the bed, holding Storey close, rocking her as the baby let out another pitiful whimper.</p><p>She needed to get her fever down. Needed to keep her hydrated. Needed—</p><p>A sharp knock at the door pulled her from her spiraling thoughts.</p><p>Sharon.</p><p>Agatha had called her the moment Nicholas had started throwing up, and now, bless her, she was here.</p><p>“I came as fast as I could,” Sharon said as she stepped inside, already taking in the situation with sharp, assessing eyes. “How bad?”</p><p>“Bad,” Agatha murmured. “Nicky’s managing, but Storey…” She adjusted her grip, feeling the heat radiating from her daughter’s tiny body. “She’s burning up, Sharon.”</p><p>Sharon stepped closer, placing the back of her hand against Storey’s forehead. Her mouth pressed into a firm line. “She’s running hot.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat felt tight. “I’m worried about dehydration. She’s barely keeping anything down.”</p><p>Sharon nodded. “Let’s take her temperature, see where we’re at.”</p><p>Agatha shifted Storey just enough for Sharon to slide a thermometer under the baby’s arm. The seconds stretched on forever before it beeped.</p><p>102.9°F.</p><p>Too high.</p><p>Agatha swallowed against the wave of panic threatening to rise. “I should call the pediatrician.”</p><p>Sharon gave her a steady look. “You should call Rio.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>She could call the pediatrician’s after-hours line. But Rio… Rio would come.</p><p>She glanced down at Storey, who let out another weak cry, her little fingers grasping at Agatha’s pajama top.</p><p>Decision made.</p><p>She grabbed her phone and dialed.</p><p>It rang twice before a groggy voice answered. “Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. “Rio,” she whispered. “I’m sorry, I know it’s late, but the kids are sick now too. Storeys running a high fever, she’s throwing up, I don’t know if she’s keeping enough fluids down, and I just—”</p><p>“I’m coming,” Rio said instantly, fully awake now. “I’ll be there in ten minutes.”</p><p>And just like that, Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding.</p><p>Rio barely remembered pulling on a sweatshirt or grabbing her keys—one moment she was in bed, and the next, she was pulling up outside Agatha’s house.</p><p>She let herself in when Sharon opened the door, her expression one of quiet relief. “She’s in the bedroom,” Sharon murmured. “Both kids are in there with her.”</p><p>Rio nodded, already moving. When she stepped into the room, her heart clenched.</p><p>Agatha sat cross-legged on the bed, looking utterly exhausted. She was still in her pajamas, her dark hair falling loose over her shoulders, and her face was paler than Rio had ever seen it.</p><p>In her arms, Storey rested limply, her little body hot against Agatha’s chest. Nicholas was curled up beside them, blinking blearily at Rio with fever-bright eyes.</p><p>The room smelled faintly of sickness and baby lotion. A damp washcloth lay discarded on the nightstand.</p><p>And Agatha—beautiful, capable, always-put-together Agatha—looked wrecked.</p><p>Rio’s heart twisted.</p><p>“Hey,” she said softly.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up, relief flashing in her tired eyes. “You came.”</p><p>“Of course I came.”</p><p>Rio stepped forward, sliding onto the bed beside her. Carefully, she reached out, her fingers brushing against Storey’s chubby arm. The heat of her skin was alarming.</p><p>“She’s been like this for hours,” Agatha murmured. “I’ve been trying to get her to take sips of water, but she won’t keep much down.”</p><p>Rio nodded, slipping into doctor mode. “Let me check her over, okay?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, as if reluctant to let Storey out of her arms, but after a beat, she carefully passed the baby over.</p><p>The second Storey left her mother’s embrace, she let out a weak, miserable whimper, her tiny fingers grasping at Rio’s hoodie.</p><p>Rio’s chest ached. “I know, sweetheart,” she murmured, cradling her gently. “I know you feel awful.”</p><p>Agatha watched intently as Rio checked Storey’s temperature, then her breathing, then gently coaxed her lips open to check for any signs of dehydration.</p><p>“Her fever’s still high,” Rio said, frowning. “But her breathing’s okay. That’s good.”</p><p>“Should I take her to the hospital?” Agatha asked, voice tight with worry.</p><p>Rio hesitated. “Not yet. If she stops making wet diapers or gets lethargic, then yes, absolutely. But for now, let’s try to get some fluids in her. Even just a teaspoon at a time.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, already reaching for the small bottle of Pedialyte on the nightstand.</p><p>Rio glanced at Nicholas, who was watching the whole exchange through half-lidded eyes.</p><p>“How are you feeling, buddy?” she asked gently.</p><p>Nicholas gave a small shrug. “Bad Rio.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly. “Yeah, I bet.”</p><p>She reached out, brushing a hand over his forehead. Still warm, but not as bad as Storey.</p><p>When she turned back to Agatha, her heart squeezed all over again.</p><p>The woman looked done in.</p><p>Her shoulders sagged with exhaustion, dark circles under her eyes betraying just how little sleep she’d gotten.  Her chest rattled when she breathed in. And yet, even now, her entire focus was on her kids. On keeping them comfortable. On worrying over them instead of herself.</p><p>God, she was incredible.</p><p>Rio swallowed against the sudden, overwhelming feeling in her chest. She hadn’t thought she could fall any harder for Agatha. She had been wrong.</p><p>Carefully, she reached out, squeezing Agatha’s knee. “You need to rest too.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small, breathless laugh. “Not really an option right now.”</p><p>“It is if I’m here.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her, clearly startled. “You—you’re going to stay?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Did you think I’d just check Storey over and leave?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha admitted, voice quieter now. “I didn’t want to assume.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, her heart twisting. She had messed up before. Had pulled back. Had made Agatha think that she was scared of this. But she wasn’t scared anymore.</p><p>She wanted this. Wanted Agatha, wanted Nicholas, wanted Storey. Wanted the chaos and the love and even the long, sleepless nights when her family were ill.</p><p>So instead of answering, she simply adjusted her hold on Storey, pressing a kiss to the baby’s damp curls.</p><p>“I’m here,” she murmured. “For as long as you’ll have me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. For a long moment, she just looked at Rio, something raw and vulnerable in her expression. Then, finally, she let out a soft, shaky sigh and leaned into Rio’s side.</p><p>And Rio, who had once been so scared of this life, wrapped her free arm around Agatha’s shoulders and held her close.</p><p>Agatha had barely slept, hadn’t eaten properly in over twenty-four hours, and had been holding Storey against her fevered body for most of the night. So when Rio found her swaying on her feet in the kitchen the next morning, pale and trembling struggling to breath properly, she wasn’t surprised.</p><p>But it still made her heart clench.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha gripped the edge of the counter, squeezing her eyes shut as if willing away the dizziness. “I’m fine,” she muttered.</p><p>Rio stepped forward, wrapping a steadying arm around her waist. “You’re not fine.”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft, humorless laugh. “Mothers don’t get sick days.”</p><p>“Maybe not,” Rio agreed. “But they do get help.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, sagging slightly against her. “Storey’s worse,” she admitted, voice tight with worry. “She barely slept, and she’s refusing everything I offer her. She’s so weak, Rio.”</p><p>“I know, sweetheart.” Rio pressed a kiss to the side of her head, heart aching at the sheer exhaustion in Agatha’s voice. “Let me take care of her. And you.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>Rio could see the internal battle, the desperate need to do everything warring against the sheer exhaustion in her body.</p><p>So Rio did the only thing she could. She took over.</p><p>Gently but firmly, she maneuvered Agatha away from the kitchen and guided her toward the couch. “Sit,” she instructed. “Just for a few minutes.”</p><p>“Rio—”</p><p>“No arguments.” She crouched down in front of her, brushing damp hair away from Agatha’s face. “I promise you, I’ve got this.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips pressed together, her stubbornness warring with her fatigue.</p><p>But then Storey let out a weak, pitiful whimper from the baby monitor, and Agatha sagged in defeat.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio kissed her forehead before standing. “Good. Now stay there.”</p><p>Rio moved through the house with purpose, stepping into the Agathas bedroom where Storey lay curled in her mothers bed, her usually vibrant little face pale and clammy.</p><p>“Oh, sweetheart,” Rio murmured, scooping her up gently. “I know, baby. I know you feel awful.”</p><p>Storey let out another small whimper, burrowing weakly against Rio’s chest.</p><p>Rio checked her over quickly—her fever was still high, and she was definitely more lethargic than before.</p><p>Her stomach tightened.</p><p>“Alright, little love,” she murmured. “Let’s get you feeling better.”</p><p>She carried Storey back to the living room, where Agatha was watching with tired, worried eyes.</p><p>“Her fever’s still high,” Rio said gently. “I think we should take her in.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, nodding. “Okay.”</p><p>“I’ll drive,” Rio said. “You just focus on her.”</p><p>Nicholas, still curled up under a blanket on the couch, looked up blearily. “Where are you going?”</p><p>“Mommy and I are taking Storey to the doctor, buddy,” Rio explained. “Sharon’s going to stay with you, okay?”</p><p>Nicholas frowned but nodded. “Is Storey gonna be okay?”</p><p>“She’s gonna be just fine,” Rio assured him.</p><p>Agatha pressed a shaky kiss to Nicholas’s forehead. “I’ll be home soon, baby.”</p><p>Nicholas just nodded, curling back into his blanket.</p><p>The drive to the hospital was quiet except for Storey’s weak little whimpers and Agatha’s heavy breathing beside her.</p><p>Rio kept stealing glances at her—sweat was beading along Agatha’s hairline, her hands shaking slightly in her lap.</p><p>She was getting worse too.</p><p>By the time they reached the ER, Rio had made a decision.</p><p>She wasn’t just going to check Storey in—she was checking Agatha in too.</p><p>Rio sat in the hospital chair, utterly drained.</p><p>Storey had been admitted for fluids—she had a nasty stomach virus and was dehydrated, but thankfully, there was no serious infection.</p><p>Agatha, on the other hand, had tried so hard to downplay how bad she was feeling.</p><p>But the moment the doctor took her vitals and saw the her chest infection had developed into pneumonia which was now raging in her system, she had been hooked up to an IV as well.</p><p>Now, hours later, Rio sat between their hospital beds, watching as Storey finally slept soundly in her crib and Agatha dozed lightly, her fingers still curled protectively near her daughter.</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, rubbing a hand down her face.</p><p>She had been so scared of this life. Of stepping into the chaos of parenthood, of getting too deep, of falling too hard.</p><p>And now?</p><p>Now, she was here, watching over this beautiful, exhausted woman and her equally beautiful children, and the only thing she could think was— This is where I want to be. I love them.</p>

<p>By the time Agatha and Storey were discharged, Rio had fully stepped into the role of caretaker.</p><p>She didn’t ask if Agatha needed help—she just did it.</p><p>She helped Agatha into the passenger seat of her own car, carefully securing a now-sleeping Storey in her car seat before driving them home.</p><p>Agatha dozed against the window the entire way, her body still weak, her exhaustion bone-deep.</p><p>When they finally pulled into the driveway, Rio parked and turned to her, brushing a gentle hand over her cheek.</p><p>“Agatha,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha stirred with a soft sigh, blinking blearily at her. “Home?”</p><p>“Yeah, sweetheart.” Rio smiled softly. “Stay put, okay? I’ll get Storey inside first.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, too tired to argue.</p><p>Rio moved quickly, unbuckling Storey and cradling her against her chest before carrying her inside. Nicholas, who had been curled up on the couch with Sharon, looked up immediately.</p><p>“Mama?” he asked, his little face full of concern.</p><p>“They’re okay, buddy,” Rio assured him. “Mama and Storey just need lots of rest.”</p><p>Sharon stood, her sharp gaze scanning Rio’s face. “How bad was it?”</p><p>“Dehydration, exhaustion, high fevers,” Rio listed off. “Agatha has pneumonia. They’re both going to be fine, but Agatha needs actual rest, which I know she won’t take unless someone makes her.”</p><p>Sharon snorted. “You’re not wrong.”</p><p>Rio shook her head with a small smile. “I’m going to get her inside. Can you get Nicholas ready for bed?”</p><p>“Already ahead of you,” Sharon said. “His pajamas are on, and he brushed his teeth.”</p><p>Nicholas tugged on Rio’s sleeve. “Can I sleep with Mama and Storey?”</p><p>Rio softened. “I think that’s a great idea.”</p><p>With that, she went back out to the car, finding Agatha half-asleep again.</p><p>“Come on, babe,” Rio murmured, unbuckling her. “Let’s get you inside.”</p><p>Agatha let out a sleepy grumble but allowed Rio to help her out of the car, leaning heavily against her as they made their way inside.</p><p>By the time they reached the bedroom, Nicholas had already climbed into the huge bed, waiting patiently for his mom.</p><p>Rio carefully settled Storey in the middle of the bed before turning to Agatha.</p><p>“Come here,” she murmured, guiding her onto the mattress.</p><p>Agatha barely had the strength to tug the blankets up before Nicholas curled against her side, his little arms wrapping around her waist. Storey, still sleeping soundly, let out a tiny sigh, her small fingers curled into the fabric of Agatha’s shirt.</p><p>Rio stood back, watching the scene with something warm and heavy in her chest.</p><p>This wasn’t just caretaking, this was family. And she wanted it. She wanted them.</p><p>With a soft smile, she leaned down, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s forehead. “Get some sleep, beautiful. I’ll be here.”</p><p>Agatha’s tired eyes fluttered open. “You don’t have to stay,” she murmured, though her fingers weakly curled around Rio’s wrist, contradicting her words.</p><p>Rio just kissed her again. “I want to.”</p><p>And with that, she pulled up a chair, settling in to keep watch over all three of them—her heart completely and irrevocably theirs.</p><p>It took Agatha a few weeks to realize she was in love with Rio.</p><p>Not because she didn’t feel it—oh, she felt it. It was there in every text Rio sent just to check in, in every thoughtful gesture, in the way she seamlessly stepped into their lives. In the way Nicholas had started calling her “Riri” like it was the most natural thing in the world, in the way Storey reached for her with chubby little hands.</p><p>It was in the way Rio looked at her.</p><p>But Agatha had learned, through hard-earned experience, that love could be fragile. And she had children to think about.</p><p>So she hadn’t let herself put a name to it. Not yet.</p><p>But then, one night, it hit her - soft and sudden, like stepping into the warmth of the sun after weeks of cold.</p><p>She’d fallen asleep on the couch, exhausted from a long day of meetings and childcare, with Storey asleep on her chest. Nicholas had been tucked into bed earlier, but Rio had stayed, curled up beside her, rubbing slow, soothing circles into her back.</p><p>Somewhere in the haze of sleep, Agatha had stirred just enough to hear her.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio whispered, voice barely audible over the quiet hum of the TV.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, but she didn’t open her eyes.</p><p>Rio’s fingers brushed gently over her hair, tucking a stray curl behind her ear.</p><p>“I know you’re not ready to hear it,” she murmured. “That’s okay. I’ll wait.”</p><p>Agatha felt her throat tighten, warmth spreading through her chest.</p><p>Rio had been saying it. Loving her, without expectation, without pressure, just there, like something steady and solid she could fall into whenever she was ready.</p><p>And God, Agatha was ready.</p><p>She just had to find the courage to say it out loud. The realization sat heavy in Agatha’s chest for days.</p><p>She loved Rio. She really, truly loved her.</p><p>And Rio already knew. She’d been saying it when Agatha was asleep, waiting patiently for her to be ready.</p><p>That knowledge should have made it easier to say the words back, but somehow, it made it harder. Because saying it meant letting go—of fear, of doubt, of the little voice in her head that always told her love didn’t last.</p><p>But Rio was still here. Through hers and the kids’ sickness, through the chaos of Agatha’s life, through the late nights and the early mornings—she stayed.</p><p>So Agatha decided she wasn’t going to let fear hold her back. Not this time.</p><p>It was a Friday night when she finally said it.</p><p>The kids were asleep, and Rio was over again, curled up on Agatha’s couch with a blanket thrown over her lap. They’d ordered Thai food, and Agatha had just refilled their wine glasses when Rio reached for her hand, lacing their fingers together.</p><p>“You’re quiet tonight,” Rio murmured, her thumb brushing over Agatha’s knuckles. “What’s on your mind?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart pounded. Say it. Just say it.</p><p>She set her glass down, turning to fully face Rio. “I heard you.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Heard me?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, gathering her courage. “That night. When I fell asleep on the couch. You told me you love me.”</p><p>Rio’s lips parted, but she didn’t deny it. She just nodded slowly, waiting.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, then reached out, cupping Rio’s face in her hands. “I love you, too.”</p><p>The words left her lips soft and certain, settling into the space between them like they’d always belonged there.</p><p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath, eyes going glassy. “You do?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, brushing her thumb over Rio’s cheek. “Yeah, I do.”</p><p>A shaky laugh bubbled out of Rio as she pulled Agatha into a deep, lingering kiss, her hands curling into the fabric of Agatha’s sweater.</p><p>When they finally broke apart, Rio pressed her forehead against Agatha’s, still grinning like an idiot.</p><p>“I’ve been waiting to hear you say that,” she admitted.</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “I know.”</p><p>Rio kissed her again—slow and sweet, like she had all the time in the world.</p><p>And Agatha let herself fall, knowing this time, she wouldn’t hit the ground.</p>
