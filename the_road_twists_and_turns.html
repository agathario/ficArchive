     Summary
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      After Lilia Calderu flips the Tower card over, Agatha and Rio's fight is interrupted by a summons.  A divine summons from Rio's father. Leaving the Road, Agatha and Rio have to pay the Underworld a visit. What do they learn once they are there?
     </p>

     Notes
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      Was anyone asking for an AU where there are some gods around? I have no idea. But the idea came to me and I couldn't stop thinking about it.
     </p>
<p>
      The lore from the comics and Greek myths is used hard and put away wet, so if you're a purest, you might want to look away now.
     </p>
<p>
      It picks up in the middle of Rio and Agatha's fight after Lilla dies.

<p>
     "... You call what you did special treatment?" Agatha asked with a mix of pain and anger in her eyes but also something else. There was a longing for the woman - no the entity because Agatha learned long ago that Rio Vidal might look like a woman but she could never be reduced to something so utterly human as that - to make all this pain that had twisted and turned inside every inch of her to go away.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened her mouth to offer a snappy retort but with a tilt of her head her mouth slammed shut. The venom covered barb had been right there on the tip of her tongue but with a single pull from somewhere far beyond this damned road the venom faded.
    </p>
<p>
     "We need to go," Rio said in a monotone voice. Her expression almost blank with just a slight undercurrent of confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     "Go?" Agatha scoffed.
    </p>
<p>
     "My father is summoning us. Both of us," Rio answered knowing that her answer would offer no clarification. For all the time they spent together, for all the conversations they had shared deeply personal details, the subject of Rio's familial connections had never come up.
    </p>
<p>
     "Father?" Agatha asked in utter confusion just as Rio expected. “Us? You have parents?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course. Immortal beings fuck too, Agatha," Rio said, slightly elongating the word 'fuck' just to try to get some sense of control back.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm not going anywhere with you," Agatha said with a growing sense of anger that whatever tit for tat they were in the middle of had been shut down. She needed a fight. She craved it. And Rio had been the greatest sparring partner she could ever ask for.
    </p>
<p>
     "He is not someone you keep waiting when he summons," Rio said. "And Mother is there too. People think she's the sweet one but she has a steel spine that might very well..." She trailed off. "You don't need a lesson on my family tree right now. We need to go."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned and walked over to a fallen tree and sat down. "Oh I think if you want me to go anywhere with you, I'm going to at least need the Reader's Digest version," she said with a quirk of her eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's jaw tightened. "The cosmos writes and rewrites itself. Gods are fact and fiction wrapped up in the same bow. The land beyond this one, the underworld, is ruled by a pair of entities that have styled themselves after part of the Greek Pantheon," she explained as she tried to unravel stories too old for even her to wade through to find a conclusion.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're telling me your parents are Hades and Persephone?" Agatha asked with a look of utter disbelief on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm telling you that is the story they have created for the last few thousand years. What came before doesn't matter anymore because they have rewritten the fabric of time and space to make it true. They do that sometimes when they get bored," Rio sighed as she tried to fight the urge to go get a human cigarette. It wasn't like Death could get lung cancer after all.
    </p>
<p>
     A dozen questions raced through Agatha's mind at this new information but the look in Rio's eyes told her that asking questions would lead to more frustration and to somehow less answers.
    </p>
<p>
     "And your father, Hades, is summoning us?" Agatha asked with disbelief like Rio had somehow grown a second head. No. If Rio had grown a second head that would make more sense than what she was being told now.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes," Rio answered. "And if we keep him waiting much longer he might send someone to collect us."
    </p>
<p>
     "Collect?" Agatha asked with trepidation.
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't ask," Rio said with a hint of something akin to fear in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Right," Agatha said with a roll of her eyes. "Fine, I don't care if this makes sense or if you're setting up some trap to put my soul in a vase for the next thousand years. If your father is summoning us then let's leave this farce of a road and go visit. I always wanted to meet the in-laws."
    </p>
<p>
     The bonding ritual they did under a blood moon hundreds of years ago was still in full effect and made her words technically true. Still, they forced Rio to have to prevent herself from wincing at the familiarity of the term in-laws. That hit too close to where her black heart rested.
    </p>
<p>
     "Take my hand," Rio said in a somber tone. "Don't let go until I tell you it's okay."
    </p>
<p>
     "If this is a plot just to hold my hand Rio, I will find a way to cause you pain," Agatha said in warning even as her own fingers laced between Rio's.
    </p>
<p>
     "You've always been able to do that," Rio said before she pulled out the knife in her belt.
    </p>
<p>
     "What's that for?" Agatha asked as she took a half step away.
    </p>
<p>
     "This," Rio said simply.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio used the knife to cut a hole in the fabric of time and space and open a portal to the underworld. Sparks of sickly green glowed at the edges as the portal widened enough for the pair to slip through. Once the knife was sheathed again, Rio turned to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ready?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Not one bit."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded as she tugged Agatha through the portal without another word.
    </p>

<p>
     Chapter Notes
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
      The reaction to this has been fantastic. Thanks to all of you.
     </p>
</blockquote>

<div>
<p>
     The thing that surprised Agatha the most about the underworld was how much light there was. She didn't have to squint to make out small bits of rock or try and find Rio at her side. As far as her eyes could see was bathed in a golden light.
    </p>
<p>
     "People think the underworld is dark and damp and depressed but it's not," Rio said as if she read Agatha's thoughts. In reality she just read her expression.
    </p>
<p>
     Besides them there was an infinite line of souls waiting to cross a river that was wider than she had ever seen before. Men, women and most painfully children stood in a queue together as a barge loaded up with a group of souls to bring them across the choppy water. Once they departed the line would move forward as the next group prepared.
    </p>
<p>
     "Here," Rio said as she held out a worn copper coin. "When we get to the barge you'll need to give it to Charon. No one rides for free."
    </p>
<p>
     "Even you?" Agatha asked with a forced tone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Even me if I materialize on this side of the river," Rio confirmed as they started walking beside the line toward the barge. Death got to cut the line after all.
    </p>
<p>
     The closer to the river they were the more Agatha could make out the other side. There were three massive islands with one in the center several times later than the other two islands - for lack of a better world Agatha thought to herself - floating in a sea of mist. The only part that seemed to really be on solid land was a path up to a large stone castle. The type of place that if it were up to her, she would sooner run from than head toward.
    </p>
<p>
     "My Lady," Charon called before bowing his head when the pair cut across the line of souls who all gave Rio a wide berth.
    </p>
<p>
     "Charon," Rio said with a bow of her head. "Daddy's calling his favorite child home and I brought the Mrs."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha bit back something snarky at that. Facing whatever version of Hades she was about to was giving her a dull headache already, she didn't need to somehow be tossed from the barge she was about to step on.
    </p>
<p>
     "A coin each then," Charon said as he held his hand out. "And mind the edge, Mrs. Fall in this water and not even the Lady here will be able to drag your soul back out."
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha entered the barge, her hand was still tightly in Rio's. Purely for safety and not at all because she hadn't been this freaked out in a long time. She held on to a large wooden pole in the middle of the barge as souls filled around them.
    </p>
<p>
     The souls would sometimes glance at Rio but it wasn't fear in their eyes, not for the vast majority Agatha noted to herself, it was respect. Lady Death had been the last image they saw before crossing over to this place and for most the peace they found waiting in line had led them to respect her role in the cosmos.
    </p>
<p>
     "Some would sooner dump me in the water than nod their head at me," Rio whispered to Agatha. "Not everyone takes my hand as willingly as others."
    </p>
<p>
     That caused Agatha to flex her hand in Rio's but she didn't dare let go as they hit a slightly rough patch of water. She was not about to be dumped overboard and have whatever torment would happen to her done because she couldn't stomach holding on to Rio's hand for a few more moments. As the water smoothed out again, she noted that Rio still had her human face on and not her skeletal one. Part of her was glad for it and another wished to see Rio as she usually was when she was in this place.
    </p>
<p>
     "Everyone off and hurry up about it," Charon said loudly once he docked at the other side. "Souls to the left and up the hill. Cosmic entities and guests straight up the hill and down the hallway."
    </p>
<p>
     "I think I remember the way," Rio said with a low chuckle. "See you around, Charon."
    </p>
<p>
     Without another word, Agatha and Rio disembarked the barge and headed up a path that led straight to the front of the castle.
    </p>
<p>
     "They are the different afterlives," Rio said when she turned her head and caught Agatha looking at the floating islands.
    </p>
<p>
     "Different afterlives?" Agatha questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     "Souls are judged and sent where they belong," Rio explained. "The big one in the middle in that soft white light is where most people go. A place for the mostly good, a little bad, and very human to end up. The one on the left bathed in golden light is where the very good, where heroes and those truly worthy, end up. And the one on the right that is darker than the rest is where the very worst spend their afterlife. Not even I visit there if I can help it."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's mind flashed to Nicky and where he would be. Her mind churned at the idea the island she would be cast to was likely very different from her son. She had no doubt if her soul was judged it wouldn't be bathed in golden light or even soft white. Nicky would be in the golden light, she was sure of it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good to know I won't have you visiting after I meet my untimely end. A long, long, long time from now," Agatha forced out.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just shook her head at the self deprecation. Judging souls wasn't her job and she forced herself to remember that. Whatever happened when Agatha died, all she had to do was get her here. Then fate and the natural order would take over. No fuss, no muss. Even as she thought it she knew it was a lie. There would be both fuss and muss when that day finally came.
    </p>
<p>
     After passing through the large stone entryway and walking down a hallway made of the same oily black stone they came to a large set of bog oak doors.
    </p>
<p>
     "Look, Agatha," Rio started as they stood in front of the closed doors to the throne room. "I don't know what is going to happen in there. I've never been summoned with a human I knew like I know you."
    </p>
<p>
     "You're telling me I'm the first woman you've brought home?" Agatha joked to try and find some sense of control.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm telling you I will protect you as best I can but the forces at play might be very well out of even my control," Rio said seriously. "My parents are more powerful than you can understand."
    </p>
<p>
     "Got it," Agatha said as she turned more serious at the pleading look in Rio's eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Without prompting from other of them, the massive doors swung open. The pillars inside of the throne room lighting it brighter than anywhere they had been so far down here. It was like high noon.
    </p>
<p>
     "Come forward, daughter and Ms. Harkness," A woman's voice called. The voice was like a spring rain on a tin roof. A comforting sound that would make lesser witches let their guard down.
    </p>
<p>
     "Show time," Rio whispered as they headed inside.
    </p>
<p>
     Seated before the pair at the end of the room were two figures with several hooked figures on either side of them.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman who beckoned them forward had hair the color of chestnuts, eyes as green as the finest emeralds, tanned skin and even seated Agatha could tell somehow the type of figure that would turn anyone's head.
    </p>
<p>
     Next to her, the lord of this realm, had a beard and head of hair as deep brown as freshly tilled soil. His eyes were stern and very nearly the same dark brown as his hair with flecks of gold contrasting the deep brown. He looked as fit as his wife, though Agatha cared much less about his fitness.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nearly let out a gasp when a massive, menacing looking three headed dog lifted the middle of the three heads that had been resting on the floor near his master.
    </p>
<p>
     "Pay Cerberus no mind," Hades commanded. "He is not used to mortals who have life still before them visiting us."
    </p>
<p>
     The mention of Agatha still having life before her relaxed Rio a lot more than Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not that I don't enjoy being summoned here," Rio said to her father. "But what would you like?" She asked in as sharp of a tone as she dared use with him.
    </p>
<p>
     "So quick to ask without a hug for your mother or a kiss to your father's cheek?" Hades asked. "Have you forgotten your manors?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fought to keep from rolling her eyes. She left Agatha's side to walk up the steps to the thrones to do as her father commanded. She hugged Persephone when she stood. The hug was a genuine reflection of the affection between the goddess of spring and nature and the original green witch.
    </p>
<p>
     Once the hug broke, Rio bent down to give her seated father a kiss on the cheek. She held his hand for a moment. Their relationship often had been one of deep affection even if she was more likely to push her luck than some of her siblings. Always one to test the limits even from the first moments of her creation.
    </p>
<p>
     "Now," Rio said when she was back to Agatha's side. "Why are we here?"
    </p>
<p>
     "There are two matters before us today," Hades answered. "The first is the matter of Ms. Harkness' immortality."
    </p>
<p>
     "Her what?"
    </p>
<p>
     "My what?"
    </p>

     "Dear," Persephone said. "When you two bound yourself together all those years ago, you must have known that you would be sharing all of your gifts with her."
    </p>
<p>
     "I did not," Rio admitted even if she knew how foolish it was to do a binding spell without knowing all of the consciences. It had been a moment of weakness after a terrible nightmare Agatha had about her mother. An attempt to give Agatha a family. One she had been denied by fate.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can't die?" Agatha said with a mis of joy and terror. If she couldn't die that would allow her access to so much more power and risky behavior to get it. But if she couldn't die she would never see Nicky again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not by any mortal means," Hades corrected slightly. "My own power would separate your soul from your body with a simple thought. As would the power of my consort. A few other beings have such gifts as well but you are unlikely to cross their path. Outside of that handful of entities, you are immortal. However," he paused.
    </p>
<p>
     "Always another shoe to drop," Agatha said under her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     "The symbol of your bond must be worn less the cosmos think it's rendered invalid," Hades explained.
    </p>
<p>
     "So we need to wear our wedding bands?" Rio asked. She blinked slowly at being summoned over rings.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes," Hades confirmed.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't have mine," Agatha said with a slight panic in her voice. After Nicky died, she had launched the ring into the middle of the lake she had been near. The reminder of the woman she loved who had taken her son from her too much to even hold long enough to pawn.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have it," Rio said softly.
    </p>
<p>
     "You do?" Agatha asked as she turned from the two seated beings to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "I fished it out of the lake after you left," Rio admitted. She pulled a small pouch from an unseen pocket in her pants and dumped out the two simple golden bands into her palm.
    </p>
<p>
     Time and a lack of maintenance had left the rings dull.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a small smile at the image of Rio diving down to the bottom of the coldest lake in the state to retrieve the ring. She hoped she got bit by something when she was down there. Or sand in an unmentionable place.
    </p>
<p>
     "Give them here," Hades held his hand out. "The luster they lack will not do."
    </p>
<p>
     Hades was the god of riches after all. Once he had the rings he simply had to rub them between his hands to polish them again. The metal filled back out from where time had thinned it.
    </p>
<p>
     "You may exchange rings," Hades said as he passed the rings back to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at Agatha with the same soft expression as she had after they saw the ghost of her mother. A look of shared time and shared pain and shared loathing.
    </p>
<p>
     "Give me my ring," Agatha said with her hand extended. "I don't want to lose ..." she trailed off.
    </p>
<p>
     "Immortality or me?" Rio challenged.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced at the two gods before looking back at Rio. "You took him from me," she whispered with her eyes a mix of anger and pain.
    </p>
<p>
     "I gave him all the time I could," Rio whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     "Liar," Agatha hissed.
    </p>
<p>
     "My daughter tells the truth, Ms. Harkness," Persephone said. "She came to her father and me the day he was to be stillborn. She came after you begged, time stopped to allow it."
    </p>
<p>
     "What?" Agatha turned her head to the goddess and then back to Rio. "What is she talking about?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I begged them to give respite," Rio admitted. "I was allowed to give you the time it would take my heart to blacken. So it was cut from my chest and kept in a case. Each day my still beating heart darkened a bit until six years later it finally showed no more red," she whispered as she looked down to the floor so she didn't have to witness Agatha's expression.
    </p>
<p>
     "My heart is black and it beats for you," Agatha paraphrased the words Rio told her not so long ago.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was painful. Excruciating. But it bought you two time. Time that fate tried to deny. It wasn't what I wanted, it wasn't the lifespan he deserved but it was what I could bargain for," Rio whispered with her head still down.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed her eyes as a wave of nausea overtook her. She thought if she was anywhere but here she would vomit but somehow her body kept the bile down.
    </p>
<p>
     "I didn't know," Agatha whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     "You didn't ask and wouldn't let me explain," Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, I suppose I wouldn't," Agatha said a bit sheepishly. "I was hurting at losing my son."
    </p>
<p>
     "Ours," Rio corrected quietly. She had spent so long hearing about how Nicky was just Agatha's but she had been there at his creation. She had bargained her very heart to keep him alive.
    </p>
<p>
     "Made from scratch," Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not completely," Hades said.
    </p>
<p>
     "What did you say?" Rio's head snapped up to look at her father.
    </p>
<p>
     "What my husband means," Persephone said, "is that the two of you created him with the depths of your bond and the power of your magic. He is your son in the same way you are our daughter."
    </p>
<p>
     "I knew he had my nose," Rio muttered to herself more than anyone else in the room. She took a trembling breath at something she had suspected since Agatha told her she was pregnant was finally confirmed.
    </p>
<p>
     The confirmation of something Agatha thought impossible, foolishly at that, hit her in the chest right between her ribs and shot to her heart. Rio had made the trade for Nicky's life with her beating heart without even having confirmation he was her son. It was an act of selflessness Agatha wasn't sure even she had ever managed.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you," Agatha whispered to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "You deserved a family," Rio answered back.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held her hand out, this time with the palm down so Rio could slip the ring on her finger. The allure of immortality now co-equal with having a sign of her belonging to Rio back on her finger.
    </p>
<p>
     "If I put this ring on you, you know I will expect certain things," Rio said with her dark eyes looking into Agatha's blue.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm sure there is a bedroom around here you can drag me to," Agatha said with a smile and a roll of her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Rio said in a warning tone equally full of amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know, Rio," Agatha said in a more serious tone. "It means something. We'll figure it out. We always do after a little blood is spilled and a few blasts into a wall or two."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio snorted at that before she slipped the ring onto Agatha's ring finger without another word. The ring warmed before cooling as the bond was renewed on her end.
    </p>
<p>
     "Now yours," Agatha said as she took the ring from Rio to place it back on her finger. "It won't fall off when you go all Skeletor, right?"
    </p>
<p>
     "No," Rio chuckled. "It'll never come off again."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded before she slipped the ring back on Rio's finger. Her ring warmed as Agatha's had to signify the bond had been renewed.
    </p>
<p>
     "Matter one has been settled," Persephone said in a pleased tone. "Now there is the matter of Nicholas’ future."

<p>
     "Must we talk about him?" Rio asked in a clipped tone. After finally getting a ring back on Agatha's finger and one back on hers, the last topic she wanted to bring up with Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     "So you don't wish to see progress he's made?" Hades asked with a tilt of his head.
    </p>
<p>
     "Progress?" Rio scoffed. "He's dead. I reaped his soul and brought him here. I held his hand and watched his soul be judged. I took him to the island for the very best of humanity and I kissed his cheek before letting him go play. What progress are you talking about?"
    </p>
<p>
     "That did happen," Hades said with a simple nod. "And then he started to age. Which, as Death, you will know, is atypical."
    </p>
<p>
     "A-age?" Agatha questioned. She looked from Hades to Rio and then back again. "The dead don't age."
    </p>
<p>
     "No," Rio whispered. "But the living do,” she paused as the thought started to grow deep in her mind. “And he carried part of a mortal soul and part of an immortal one. A gift from us both."
    </p>
<p>
     "Very good, dear," Persephone said with a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "And you didn't tell me?" Rio's voice full of betrayal. "I've come here a thousand times since the day I delivered his soul. I have been sent to collect those you wish to see. I have sobbed in your arms at the loss of my son and because of his loss the loss of my wife. And you didn't dane it important to tell me he was alive?" The rage in Rio's voice bounced over the walls of the throne room.
    </p>
<p>
     "You didn't ask," Hades answered, using Rio's words from moments before against her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I want to see him," Agatha pleaded as she reached her hand out to grab on to Rio's arm before she did something wholly foolish and very her. "I want to see m-our son."
    </p>
<p>
     Hades gestured to one of the hooded figures at his side. The figure walked down the steps to stand between the gods on one side and Agatha and Rio on the other. Slowly he lowered the hood of his cloak to show off a skeletal face much like that of Death herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Except the features hadn't fully come in yet. The skin of his cheeks had a bit of acne and there were a few hairs on his upper lip that he had somehow managed to miss when he shaved this morning. His eyes though gave him away to anyone who had known him at all. He was dressed in leather pants and a white linen shirt with a vest over it. Boots on his feet.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hello Mom, Mama. I'm sorry it's been so long," Nicholas said as he reached for the tie of his cloak to toss it to the side. He looked to be about eighteen in human years but was already a head taller than Agatha or Rio. His brown hair had been cut since his time as a boy and his chest was broad now. While both of them mourned him as a boy, he had become a man. Or nearly so.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky?" Agatha whispered as she looked at the man in front of her. "Is it really you? You aren't a trick?"
    </p>
<p>
     "It's me, Mama," Nicholas promised. He shook his head and his human face returned. A bit of baby fat still clung to his cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     Without another word of search for explanation, Agatha rushed forward to wrap her arms around Nicholas' waist. She was overjoyed to learn he still smelled the same as he had with a boy. Fresh flowers and a hint of earth. It was close enough to Rio that Agatha should have understood their connection long before today.
    </p>
<p>
     "I missed you, Nicholas Scratch. I missed you more than I have ever missed anyone or anything before," Agatha said against his chest. If she pressed her face to him maybe she could hide the tears spilling freely from her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "I missed you too. I would watch you when I could. I would watch and sing the song we made together," Nicholas said. "I don't agree with all you did. I don't like killing even now. Even if I understand you were hurting."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had no retort for that so she kept her mouth shut and just held her boy.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm going to hug Mom now," Nicholas whispered after a few long moments. "Then we can go somewhere and talk, okay?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled back and wrapped her arms around herself to keep it together as much as she could. "Yeah, alright, fine," she answered as one hand reached up to wipe her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas turned to Rio and once again turned to his skeletal face. She put hers on to match her son as a sign of respect and motherly affection.
    </p>
<p>
     "I should have told you sooner I was alive. I've seen you down here before but Hades and Persephone were both teaching me for the last few hundred years and I didn't want my time here to end before I had learned what I could," Nicholas said bashfully.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are so grounded. Mega grounded. No reaping for you for at least a month," Rio said with a stern look on her face before she couldn't hold back a smile at seeing her son again. She grabbed him around the middle and pulled him into a crushing hug.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll take whatever punishment I am given as long as I get to be with you and Mama again," Nicholas said as he hugged her back as tightly as he could.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled back and looked at the skeletal face her son sported. "We'll work on your form but I like it." She wrapped her arm around his waist and turned to Agatha. "I am the father."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried not to laugh. She really did but she couldn't stop herself from the cheeky smile that lined her wife’s lips. "Apparently," she said.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to her parents and her face went human again. "May we leave and talk to our son? We have catching up to do." She knew not asking permission to leave was a bad idea.
    </p>
<p>
     "You may," Persephone answered. "When you are ready to leave you will be transported to just after the first task on the road."
    </p>
<p>
     "Why?" Agatha asked. "That Maximoff brat had to have created it."
    </p>
<p>
     "No he didn't," Nicholas looked over at his mama. "I'm the Lord of the Witches Road."
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm sorry, what?" Agatha asked as she tilted her head.
    </p>
<p>
     "Persephone and Hades wanted to give me something to try out my powers and flex my magical muscles a bit. So I turned the road real. You just don't access it by singing the song that you used for a con," Nicholas explained. "It only shows itself for those who truly stand to gain something from it."
    </p>
<p>
     “Great,” Agatha said as her headache hit a bit harder.
    </p>
<p>
     “Fine, we’ll go back and we’ll get him to turn himself in and I can take his soul where it belongs,” Rio said as she started working on a plan.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Hades said. “You are not to take him or his twin. Not yet, Rio.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He is an abomination,” Rio protested.
    </p>
<p>
     “And fate has plans for him and his twin that are greater than the disruption he causes you,” Hades said in a tone that left her no room to wiggle out of following the order.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, sir,” Rio said a bit darkly. She didn’t like it but she had no choice but to follow the order.
    </p>
<p>
     "Shall we go talk then?" Agatha asked, a bit of the color draining from her face.

<div>
<p>
     Nicholas brought Agatha and Rio away from the throne room to his personal rooms. It was a trio of rooms where his bedroom was, along with a study for him to study all he could about his powers and then a large bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     “I like soaking in a tub after training,” Nicholas explained when Rio quirked an eyebrow at him when she saw he had a bathroom. Beings like them didn't need them in the same way mortals did.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio likes baths too,” Agatha said as she moved to sit on a large chair near a giant stone fireplace.  “Even if she denies it.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I like you in a bath,” Rio corrected as she sat in the chair next to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t need to know that,” Nicholas said as he sat across from them on a sofa. “I really didn’t need to know that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re hundreds of years old,” Rio said as she crossed her legs and offered her left hand to Agatha. The glint of her wedding band catching the light in the fire in the fireplace that she created with a flick of her wrist. “You can take it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took Rio’s left hand in her right and tried to ignore just how good it felt to do something as simple as holding her wife’s hand. She really was growing soft in her old age.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas rolled his eyes but his smile gave away just how happy he was to have both of them back. “Hades and Persephone have been teaching me a lot,” he explained. “Both the death magic and the earth magic. But I can’t learn everything from them. I need to learn from the two of you to really understand everything. And…” he trailed off. “I *want* to learn from you both. I want to be back with you.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could see how young her son was at that moment. Age wouldn’t work for a being such as he was the same way it did for her or any true mortal. Even a mortal like her that had been granted immortality as a wedding present.
    </p>
<p>
     “You miss your moms,” Agatha said with a thick voice. “As any good boy would when you have moms like us.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas smiled a bit bashfully as he nodded. “I miss my moms,” he confirmed.
    </p>
<p>
     “We missed you,” Rio said. "We tore each other apart from the grief."
    </p>
<p>
     To shift the focus off of his emotions, Nicholas changed the subject. “Should I tell you my powers?” He asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Rio agreed. She pulled the knife from her belt and started to toss it up and catch it with her free hand without looking. It was a tick she did sometimes when she was nervous or thinking. It let part of her mind focus while the other relaxed. “That would be helpful.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well,” Nicholas started. “I’m a witch so I can manipulate energy and project it. I have telekinetic powers too which I guess would go with it too. And I can fly using my magic too. Though I need to work on landing still.”
    </p>
<p>
     “The landing is the hardest part,” Agatha said as she played with Rio’s fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can absorb powers too and they make me stronger,” Nicholas said. “Though it’s more like a stat bump in a video game.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You play video games?” Rio questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have a pretty sick gaming rig in my bedroom,” Nicholas said. “It’s good for my reflexes.”
    </p>
<p>
     Without warning or a hint she was about to do it, Rio flipped the knife so the blade was between her fingers and threw it at Nicholas at about half her might.
    </p>
<p>
     He grabbed the hilt with about three inches of spare before it would have gone directly through his right eye.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good reflexes,” Rio said approvingly.
    </p>
<p>
     “No trying to stab him, Rio,” Agatha said disapprovingly.
    </p>
<p>
     “He’s immortal, Agatha,” Rio reminded her.
    </p>
<p>
     “And while I believe you, I do not want to see him in an eye patch for the rest of time,” Agatha said with a stern look.
    </p>
<p>
     “I have other powers too,” Nicholas said to end their bickering. As much as he could already tell it was the natural order of things between the two to see them argue, he didn’t want to see it so soon after getting them back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Like me?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes,” Nicholas confirmed. “I’m really strong, fast and agile ￼like you are when you spar.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ve seen me spar?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Sometimes when you’d come down here to fight, I’d put my cloak and hood on and watch you in the corner of the room,” Nicholas admitted. “It was as close to you as I could be without you knowing it was me and ending my training here.”
    </p>
<p>
     “One day, we’ll spar without mama bear here stopping us before we get to the fun stuff,” Rio promised him.
    </p>
<p>
     “What else can you do?” Agatha asked, ignoring Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can teleport from the underworld to the moral world,” Nicholas said even if he had only done it once to see if he could. “I’m a telepath. I can heal people from just about anything by holding my hand over them too.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Beats having to lick them,” Rio said as she lifted her hand and recalled her knife from Nicholas’ hand.
    </p>
<p>
     “I can control the elements,” Nicholas said, ignoring the implications of what Rio just said. “Earth, water, fire, air are all natural for me to control. I can sense death too. When someone is mortally hurt or if they have a sickness I can sense it. I can cross people over but Hades told me not to do it because he thought it would give me away.”
    </p>
<p>
     “It would have,” Rio confirmed. “I would have sensed it and there would have been very loud conversations about it between me and him.”
    </p>
<p>
     “He just wanted to make sure I was trained,” Nicholas defended.
    </p>
<p>
     “And you’re the lord of the Witches Road,” Agatha added to move Rio off her daddy issues.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah,” Nicholas said. “It is real and you really were on it. I opened the portal for you but it took a little more time than usual because I didn't know it was you at first with your powers dampened.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Thanks for not letting me be murdered by the Salem Seven,” Agatha said with a tired smile.
    </p>
<p>
     “I would do anything to protect you, Mama,” Nicholas promised.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’re a good boy,” Agatha said affectionately.
    </p>
<p>
     "I try to be," Nicholas smiled.
    </p>
<p>
     “How is it going to work when we go back after the first trial?” Agatha asked. She was curious why that was the place they were going.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hades hasn’t told me much but I know that Billy is important. Him having his powers, him finding Tommy. Something to do with the order of things and the Scarlet Witch. If they die it is bad news but that’s all I know. And he needs a mentor,” Nicholas explained.
    </p>
<p>
     “Me,” Agatha sighed. “Fine, I’ll do it but that boy is going to get a good slap to the back of the head now and then if he keeps throwing temper tantrums.”
    </p>
<p>
     “After the first trial is when you needed a green witch,” Rio said as she turned to look at Agatha. “And you summoned me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “We can do that again,” Agatha nodded. “And seal the door so the Seven can’t get in. Save a bit of that drama.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And I can come with Mom,” Nicholas added. “I can help. I can’t cheat code the road, there are too many safeguards in place for cheating. Even my powers can’t cut all the corners. But I can help.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Is it safe?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can you hide who you are?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio asked at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     “I will be safe,” Nicholas promised. “And I can wear my cloak and hood. You can tell them I am your mentee or familiar or whatever you want. When it’s safe you can tell the coven who I am.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Are they going to die again?” Agatha found herself asking. It almost surprised her how much she hoped the fate could be changed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Not if I can help it,” Nicholas said. “You need a coven, Billy needs a coven.” He sat forward and looked at his mothers. “I know you are who you are. I don’t expect you to be some goody two shoes. I don’t even expect you to play by the rules. But a coven with me and Mom in it can change your future to be different than your past. And when you need power you can take it from me.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I can?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “It won’t harm you like if you took Mom’s power. I’m not Death with a capital D. I’m more like a death-ling? A cosmic witch?” Nicholas explained. “My power can rebound pretty fast if you take some and you won’t kill me if you do.  So you get what you need without hurting anyone unnecessarily to get it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha swallowed as she thought about having a coven made up of witches who could help her temper some of her more damaging nature. It was like AA for murderous witches. It would allow her to practice her craft, mentor, have her family and still fundamentally be herself without having to con witches out of their powers. Something that had lost its luster as of late if she was honest. Which she always always even to herself.
    </p>
<p>
     “Want to top me up before we go back?” Agatha asked as she looked at him.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Rio said. “Lilla, Alice and Jen would all feel it and even newbie Billy might be able to feel the difference in your powers. It has to happen later on.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right,” Agatha sighed. “You’re right.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Can I get that in writing?” Rio asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “No,” Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should go,” Nicholas said as she got to his feet. He pulled out a dagger that looked very much like Rio’s but had slightly different carvings on the handle. “Ready?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Not one bit,” Agatha said as she stood and tugged Rio up with her.
    </p>
<p>
     “You’ll be sent back just after Sharon died,” Nicholas explained. “Summon Mom and we’ll be there.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you,” Agatha said as she gave him a tight hug.
    </p>
<p>
     “I love you too,” Nicholas said against the top of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     After he stepped back, Nicholas cut into the fabric of time in space just the way Rio had before. Without another word, Agatha stepped through the hole and was suddenly falling.
    </p>

     Chapter 6
    </h2>

<div>
<p>
     Agatha came back to herself as Billy - Teen she reminded herself - was digging the grave. She stood up and watched as they dug before looking at Lilia and Jen. She looked down at her left hand and winced at the gold ring there. She slipped her hand in her pocket. She would need Rio or Nicky to cast a small spell on it once they were here.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha heard the exchange between Lilia, Jen and Alice over Alice’s mother with her back to them, trying to remind herself of who she was at this moment. She had to put on that mask for now.
    </p>
<p>
     When she turned back, Alice had joined Teen in digging the grave.
    </p>
<p>
     “Shall we go on ahead while Teen and Alice do the digging?” Agatha said as she tried to forget all she knew and fall back into the woman they expected.
    </p>
<p>
     “A woman is dead, Agatha,” Lilia said as she and Jen made no move to stand.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yes, and Alice and Teen are kindly digging a grave for her,” Agatha said as she turned to Jen and Lilia. She swirled her coat as she turned to walk even as she knew it wouldn’t work. “Mrs. Hart was a bad draft pick. The road knew that and killed her for it. My bad. But we need to carry on. More power for the rest of us.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Setting aside your staggering callousness,” Jen said as she got to her feet. “We still have the issue of our incomplete coven.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had to bite back a smile at how easy it was to get them back to this point. “Do we really need a green witch?” She baited.
    </p>
<p>
     “Of course we do,” Lilia said as she looked at Agatha. “Green magic might very well be the most powerful on the Road.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was thankful they could skip the back and forth between her and Jen about the song. Nicky might be alive but learning about this moments ago didn’t change the years she thought he was dead and the effect it had on her.
    </p>
<p>
     She watched as Lilia and Jen bickered about the potion and win Sharon drank and as Alice joined in on the skipping she kept quiet to allow the topic of a replacement green witch to be brought up again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I just wish we could go home,” Billy said as he joined the group.
    </p>
<p>
     “We can’t,” Alice said
    </p>
<p>
     “We can’t,” Billy sadly agreed.
    </p>
<p>
     “And we shouldn’t go forward without a replacement green witch," Alice added.
    </p>
<p>
     “What if we summon a backup green witch to the road?” Agatha asked as she tried to make the question seem to be spur of the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     “So much could go wrong,” Lilia scoffed.
    </p>
<p>
     “So much has already gone wrong,” Agatha pointed out. “If you’re right and we need a green witch, what other option do we have?”
    </p>
<p>
     Each member of the coven seemed to look around at the others as they slowly started to realize that Agatha might be right.
    </p>
<p>
     Teen’s spell book was brought out and again they stood around together as they each asked for different things from the green witch that would replace Sharon. Agatha tried to seem as disinterested as she had been the first time.
    </p>
<p>
     After the spell ended and they once again waited for Rio to emerge from the ground, Agatha looked the other way as she tried not to give anything away. She was very interested to see how Rio bringing her “familiar” with her would change the journey.
    </p>
<p>
     “Ah!” The coven all screamed as Rio started to pop out of the grave behind them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a half step back as she watched for Rio to finish with her theatrics. She stopped herself from rolling her eyes at how much she knew she was enjoying freaking everyone out.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey,” Rio said as she and another form, a cloaked Nicky with his hood up, stood before the coven. “Heard you were having a party.
    </p>
<p>
     “How did you…” Agatha trailed off with as much of a look of disgust as she could paint on her face as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     “I was in the neighborhood,” Rio said with a playful smile. She walked forward and again a flower, this time purple, popped out of her hand. “Surprise, my lady.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lunged as she had before and was pulled back by the coven once again. She and Rio locked eyes as she screamed at her with Rio just smirked this time. Agatha made the whole coven hold her back even as Rio just smirked wider and wider as she pretended to fight.
    </p>
<p>
     "We need to seal the road," Agatha said after she pretended to calm down. "So nothing else can follow us."
    </p>
<p>
     "Right, right, that makes sense," Teen said. "I think I have a spell in here."
    </p>
<p>
     The witches gathered and all chanted the Latin to seal the path in Rio and her 'familiar' took. Once it was done, Agatha wordlessly walked away to head down the road.
    </p>
<p>
     “So this is the road?” Rio asked the others with the same smirk still on her face. “This place is pretty neat.” She turned back to her familiar and gestured for him to go after Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Who is that?” Teen asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “My familiar,” Rio said. “Don’t worry about it. They aren’t a big talker.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Right,” Teen said, looking unsure. “Aren’t they usually animals?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Who says they aren’t?” Rio asked with a dangerous smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     “So,” Alice asked as she, Jen and Lilia stood arm in arm. “You’re a green witch?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Less a green witch and more THE green witch,” Rio said as her voice changed just to screw with them. She flashed a more demented smile before walking down the road with a little hop in her step.
    </p>
<p>
     Mama. Nicholas used his powers to communicate with her without speaking.
     <em>
      ‘You still remember everything, right? You haven’t forgotten?’
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha didn’t flinch or turn around to hug her son, she was proud of herself for that, as she kept her pace.
     <em>
      ’ I’m still all there, Nicky. Just trying to play the part they expect for now.’
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘Good.’
     </em>
     Nicholas followed her as the others followed after Rio.
     <em>
      ‘I was a little worried your memory wouldn’t go back to your past self.’
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     ‘Would have been nice to give me a heads up that was an option before you sent me back.’ Agatha turned and looked back at him for just a second before acting like she was waiting on the others so they could regroup.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      ‘Sorry.’
     </em>
     Nicholas muttered in her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Teen caught up to Agatha and gave her a nervous smile. “So your scary yet charismatic lady friend is back,” he said. “Do you want to talk about it? Are we in trouble? Like mortal trouble more than we were ten minutes ago?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stopped herself from laughing just as she pulled away from him and walked forward a bit faster. She smiled when the house from the second trial came into view.
    </p>
<p>
     “Here we go again,” Teen said right on time.
    </p>
<p>
     “Pass,” Alice said from the back and she started to walk away.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had her playful smirk back. “A mutiny already?”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did roll her eyes as she followed after Alice.
    </p>
<p>
     “What’s the plan, Alice?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Go back the way we came?” Alice suggested. “Go back, go around, go anywhere but that house.”
    </p>
<p>
     They turned the corner and once again the house was in front of them again.
    </p>
<p>
     “I agree but the road clearly does not,” Agatha said as Alice stopped dead in her tracks. “So I guess we will go.” She looked at Alice before she started to lead the cover to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     As they walked up to the house that was right out of the 1970’s, Teen looked at the moon phase on the door.
    </p>
<p>
     “The fire phase,” Teen said.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice looked like she was halfway between running away and a panic attack as Agatha opened the door.
    </p>
<p>
     The outfits were back and the 1970’s were once again in full swing. However, Nicholas was still in his cloak with the hood up. However it had changed from black to a very 1970’s tie dye pattern.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do not eat anything, do not drink anything, do not touch anything,” Alice warned the group.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was happy to see that even with Nicky there, the start of the trial happened as before. He just sort of hung out in the corner observing in a way that Agatha had seen Rio do often when she was trying to size up a room.
    </p>
<p>
     Heading toward the back where the studio was, Agatha tried to act like she was looking for clues. At least back there, with her hand off the mic this time, she and Rio could have a moment alone. They needed some real conversations but she knew this wasn't the time for more than half a check in. If that.
    </p>
<p>
     Taking a seat at the control panel she waited for Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "Knock, knock," Rio said just like before once Agatha was seated.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wiggled the fingers on her left hand and Rio quickly got the hint. With a flick of her wrist both her and Agatha had their rings hidden.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thanks," Agatha said. "Too many questions if bands of gold popped up now."
    </p>
<p>
     "There are a lot of questions anyway," Rio said as she played with her knife. Unlike back in the underworld this wasn't the mindless playing she did to focus or relax. This was the nervous playing she did to self sooth.
    </p>
<p>
     "A few, sure," Agatha said as she turned her head to look out into the living room at the others. "He's here again but the hurt doesn't just go away, does it?"
    </p>
<p>
     "No," Rio shook her head. "It doesn't."
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm not very good at telling people I'm sorry. Or being sorry. Or telling people things," Agatha said as she fidgeted in the chair. "But I am. Knowing you...knowing what you did to buy us time...Thank you and I'm sorry for how I lashed out."
    </p>
<p>
     "I meant it when I said you got special treatment," Rio came closer and leaned against the desk. She looked down at Agatha with a rare completely serious expression.
    </p>
<p>
     "When we get out of here maybe we can figure out how to coexist," Agatha said as she looked up. This look was not one she had seen Rio in before but she had to say it was fantastic.
    </p>
<p>
     "I want more than coexistence," Rio said. "I want more than quick fucks between my work and your trainings. I don't want to go get Costco membership or make you breakfast in bed with fresh squeezed orange juice but I want more than to warm your bed to keep our bond active while you search for ever more power."
    </p>
<p>
     "The sex isn't worth fresh squeezed orange juice?" Agatha deflected.
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't do that," Rio chided. "Not after today. The sex is more powerful than every earthquake that has ripped through this planet. Put together. Times ten. But it doesn't hold a candle to the depths of the bond we forged together outside of your bed."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded slowly at the seriousness in Rio's voice. The green witch has been to hell and back - quite literally - today. Nothing put a crimp in a family dynamic than a multi century sin of omission by your parents to get someone shaken after all.
    </p>
<p>
     "I will be your consort in all of the ways I wasn't when you needed me to be," Agatha promised as she stood and leaned against the desk. Her hand brushed against Rio's. "And you will ground me in a way only someone who witnessed how I was made this way can do."
    </p>
<p>
     "Inventing a title for yourself?" Rio asked with a smile starting to play on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Fitting isn't it?" Agatha asked with a self satisfied smirk. "I like power, I won't deny it and I'm not ashamed of it. But sometimes I am blinded by the power that is slightly out of my grasp so I don't see how much power I could access on much less costly roads."
    </p>
<p>
     "I am among the most powerful beings that has been or will ever be," Rio whispered. "And you bring me to my knees over and over and over again."
    </p>
<p>
     It took all of Agatha's willpower not to lean in and kiss Rio right there. It also took all of her willpower not to make a sex pun. She held back and just covered Rio's hand with hers. "You gifted me something I thought I was taking for myself. Time. Life. Preventing you from taking me down." Her eyes gestured to the floor and by extension the underworld.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can't say I'm not happy to know there will never be a time I need to reap you," Rio whispered. "The order of all is important. I am bound by it and not doing what I can to keep it is physically uncomfortable." Her head turned to look at Teen before she turned back to Agatha. "But even on our worst day I would not have looked forward to that assignment."
    </p>
<p>
     "Good to know," Agatha whispered. "Maybe I would have tried to become a ghost so you would run and hide at the sight."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lip curled. "I hate ghosts."
    </p>
<p>
     "And yet you stood up to a particularly nasty one. For me," Agatha whispered.
    </p>
<p>
     "On my knees for you as usual," Rio said with a low chuckle. She turned her hand under Agatha's so they could lace their fingers. "There is no timeline where I left you with her. You do know that, don't you?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I do," Agatha whispered. "Thank you for that."
    </p>
<p>
     "Anything for my lady," Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned her head and saw Billy heading to the record. "Nothing needs to change this trial, does it?" She asked as she didn't think so. This was their best work as far as she was concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     "No," Rio said as she thought it over. "Just make sure you nudge Jen like before to heal quickly."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's comment was cut off by the horrible sound of the record being played.
    </p>
<p>
     Show time.

<p>
      This is a big old chapter y'all. Hope you enjoy it.

<div>
<p>
     Agatha sat next to Teen as he recovered from his wounds after the demon that Alice defeated threw him through a window. Even though Agatha knew there were at least two ways he would be saved - Jen as the primary option because she did it the first time and Nicholas as the backup with his healing powers - she still worried about him healing properly.
    </p>
<p>
     She was walking a road that came from a song she and her son created when he was a boy, a road her son made into fact after he was dead, with another woman's son. And to top it off she was being protective. And now Nicholas was here, in secret of course, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe she had changed.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe seeing Teen as close to born as he ever was made her connect with him.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Wanda had programmed her to care as part of the hex.
    </p>
<p>
     Honestly she wasn't overly sure she cared why she cared. She just had to figure out how to handle that she cared. Hades himself said this teen and his twin and even his mother had a role to play in fate. A role she was meant to be there to mentor at least him, if not all three.
    </p>
<p>
     Lucky her.
    </p>
<p>
     When Teen started to move she looked over at him.
    </p>
<p>
     "Still alive?" She asked as he sat up. "Great."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Teen asked in that same voice that she half hated and half thought really was adorable. "Did you put the sigil on me?"
    </p>
<p>
     "No," she answered as she had before.
    </p>
<p>
     She went on to explain more about the sigils even if she knew the question that was coming. The question about what happened to her Nicky. Asked in a way that, at the time, she thought he really carried. Maybe he did. That didn't matter now. She needed to either think of a better answer than she had or she needed to react in just the same way. Even when she spoke about sigils, she wasn't sure what she would do.
    </p>
<p>
     "You don't have to know a person's name to know who they are," Agatha said to Teen.
    </p>
<p>
     "Careful you don't say something nice to me," Teen said with that smile that did remind Agatha of her son. Her undead son who was currently sitting a few feet from Rio as the others talked and got to know each other better.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh I won't," Agatha said.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Teen said after a beat. "What really happened to your son?"
    </p>
<p>
     The question hung in the air between them for a moment as Agatha had to think on her feet to decide which way she would answer. Cut him off as she had before or ease into things and help build some trust she may or may not need to cash in on later?
    </p>
<p>
     "That's a story for another time and place," Agatha said as she looked down at the dirt and picked at a small patch of grass. Even with him in her life again, the change had happened too suddenly for her to have had time to process it. "With alcohol. For me and not you since you're a child."
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm 16," Teen protested once again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Far too young for something as sinful as alcohol," Agatha said as she got to her feet. "Rest up. There is much ahead of us."
    </p>
<p>
     With a final look at the boy, Agatha walked toward the group. She took a moment to pause and observe them before she joined their conversation. Jen was talking about her root work while Lilia and Alice looked more relaxed than she had remembered seeing them at any time after this point. Rio was toying with a flower as she bantered with the group. And Nicky, her sweet boy, was sitting on the ground with his back against the log. He was close to Rio and leaning against her slightly like she remembered him doing with her countless times when he was a boy.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe having a coven didn't totally suck.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about you, Agatha?” Alice asked when she joined the group.
    </p>
<p>
     “What about me?” Agatha asked as she took a seat next to Rio. She sat a bit closer than she had the first time this moment happened. Some of the pain between them had been mitigated.
    </p>
<p>
     “Do you have any scars?” Alice questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     She and Rio smiled at each other as she rolled up her shirt sleeve to explain how the knitting needle went through her skin. She textured it a bit more this time, adding details about how they had been tricking pregnant women into giving their babies up before killing them. That was the piece even Agatha felt crossed a line.
    </p>
<p>
     “Any scars Rio?” Lilia asked as she tilted her head to give Rio a look.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought about the answer as the others looked at her. Her talking about the scar Agatha left on her before was to get Agatha’s attention not the groups but Agatha knew far more now than she had then.
    </p>
<p>
     “Just from the nipples being removed on my back,” Rio said with a twisted smile to try to get the focus off of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snorted from beside her as the others laughed. “You heal quickly,” she commented.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen, who had been watching the two closely during the exchange, tilted her head. “What is the deal with the two of you?” She finally asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Deal?” Agatha asked, playing dumb.
    </p>
<p>
     “You two act like you want to kill each other one second, like you want to mount each other the next and keep looking at each other with these weird looks,” Jen pointed out.
    </p>
<p>
     “And when Rio showed up you seemed less than pleased but now you’re practically sitting thigh to thigh,” Alice added.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio and Agatha exchanged a look at the breakdown. Both asked the other if they were ready to share this secret to the group.
    </p>
<p>
     “Rio is my no longer estranged wife,” Agatha finally admitted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wife?” All three witches spoke together.
    </p>
<p>
     “Agatha Harkness has a wife?” Jen said in total shock.
    </p>
<p>
     “Homophobic much?” Rio snorted as she reached a hand over to rest just above Agatha’s right knee.
    </p>
<p>
     “Oh please,” Jen said while she rolled her eyes. “I’m just shocked she convinced someone to marry her without running a con to do it.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas’ hand moved to the hilt of his danger under his cloak.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      ’Don’t, Nicky,’
     </em>
     Rio said, using her powers to communicate to him.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      ’They are insulting Mama.’
     </em>
     Nicholas said back.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      ’I know sweetheart.’
     </em>
     Rio reached down and rested a hand on his shoulder for just a moment.
     <em>
      'She can handle it.'
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     “There was no con,” Agatha said in a quiet voice. “It’s the most normal thing I think I’ve ever done.” Normal was not typically a word that Agatha ever wanted to be associated with her. But falling in love with a pretty girl, being asked to be a wife, saying yes, it was all wonderfully, magically normal. Even if their circumstances weren't.
    </p>
<p>
     “What type of ceremony did you have?” Lilia asked. She had been around for at least as long as Agatha, longer even, and knew there were several options they could have chosen.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked over at Agatha as if to ask her how honest she wanted to be with the group. She turned back to the group after Agatha gave a nod to go on.
    </p>
<p>
     “We bound our souls together. What’s hers is mine and what’s mine is hers,” Rio answered.
    </p>
<p>
     “For the rest of our unnaturally long lives,” Agatha added.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia brought a hand up to her chest at the weight of the bond. There was no higher bond two beings could join themselves into. It was much deeper than a magical bonding or a blood rite. It was total and permanent. Death itself couldn’t sever the bond.
    </p>
<p>
     “That explains a lot,” Alice nodded slowly. “You two look at each other to okay things before doing them sometimes. My partner on the force and his wife used to have the same looks.”
    </p>
<p>
     “They say there is someone for everyone,” Jen said as she watched the two.
    </p>
<p>
     “That’s what they say,” Agatha agreed. “Teen is resting, I would suggest all of you get some sleep before we move on to the next task. I’m going to go gather some more firewood.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’ll help,” Rio said as she stood. She turned to Nicky. “Watch over them,” she ordered to play into the familiar aspect.
    </p>
<p>
     “Thank you,” Alice said, glad to have even a dark figure in a cloak there to watch over them as they tried to get some sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved away from the others like she had the last time she and Rio needed some time and space. She waited once more for her love even if this time her heart was a little less heavy.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio walked up behind her and touched her back. She played with the ends of her hair. She just soaked up the fact she got to touch her again. This time without the weight of a dead son emotionally constipating them both.
    </p>
<p>
     “Why did you take him while I slept?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio’s head snapped up at the question. She hadn’t expected Agatha to ask such a heavy question to her on the road. But she couldn’t deny her mind had gone back to reaping Nicky’s soul more than once since they found out he was still alive. Or undead more correctly.
    </p>
<p>
     “I didn’t want you to have to watch,” Rio answered honestly. “And I thought it would be easier.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Easier?” Agatha turned around. “I woke up to a dead son. Cold and lifeless where the day before he had been…” She trailed off because he hadn’t been warm and full of energy the day before. He was sick and no amount of magic would have saved him. “…alive.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Easier for me,” Rio admitted with her eyes cast down. “I know if you begged for his life it would make a hard situation impossible. And my heart was completely black. I used all of the time I could steal for him.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted her right hand up and pressed it to Rio’s chest where that black heart still rested. She felt it give an especially hard beat under her palm. “It really does beat for me, doesn’t it?” She asked Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     “It has since the moment I first saw you,” Rio admitted. “You were the most captivating woman I’ve ever seen. Then. Still.”
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled Rio in and held tight to her. She needed to have the feeling of Rio’s arms round her, the feeling of her arms around Rio after so long of a separation. When she felt Rio hold her just as tightly as she was holding on it made her own heart beat a little faster.
    </p>
<p>
     Neither would ever be able to say who the first one to lean in for the kiss was. Agatha would swear they were moved by a force even greater than magic and Rio would swear it was time and space folding in so they were closer.
    </p>
<p>
     But the kiss?
    </p>
<p>
     It was fireworks and earthquakes and the moon landing all rolled up together with magic dust on top. Teeth clanked and tongues stroked over tongues and moans - both thinking it was the other when it was both of them - came from some place deep inside of them. This was a homecoming.
    </p>
<p>
     They pulled back from the kiss and for a moment rested forehead to forehead. Being roughly the same height did make that a common move for them both.
    </p>
<p>
     “We should get back to the others,” Agatha said as she finally pulled away. “The next trial is going to suck.”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio made a face as she was reminded they got to face Agatha’s mother again. “Whatever happens, I won’t leave you. Our boy won't either. The coven will have your back. Even if it's at knife point.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Don’t let me kill Alice, please?” Agatha whispered. Her voice was full of genuine fear it might all repeat. “I can be good.”
    </p>
<p>
     “I know you can,” Rio said before she wrapped an arm around her waist as she led her back to the fire.

<p>
     It was hours later, everyone, including Agatha, sleeping as they tried to save up their energy for whatever the road had in store for them next. Rio and Nicholas sitting up and watching as their need for rest was very different from the others.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was sleeping with her head in Rio's lap as she leaned against the log she had been sitting on before. A blanket of vines and moss kept her warm as she was farther from the fire than Jen, Lilia, Alice and Teen - who had come over to join the group - all slept in a semi circle around the magically sustaining fire.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas stood up and waved his hand to ensure that the others would not wake up for a few more hours, pulled his cloak off and set it on the logs before stretching his limbs.
    </p>
<p>
     "How are you doing playing the dark and quiet type?" Rio asked now that the others wouldn't wake at the sound of her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's going," Nicholas answered honestly. "I didn't realize how much I would miss talking until I couldn't."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled as she stroked through Agatha's hair as she slept. The simple act of touching her like this was doing more than she could put into words to heal old wounds. On top of the fact that Agatha allowed the others to see her in this position in the first place. She would stab any of them if they used this against her in the next trial though.
    </p>
<p>
     "You get that from your mother," Rio said as she looked down at her sleeping wife. "She uses words as effectively as her magic."
    </p>
<p>
     "And you're happy to lurk in the shadows?" Nicholas asked as he took a seat next to her on the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mostly," Rio said.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas pulled his dagger from his belt and a stone from his pocket. He started to slowly sharpen it to give his hands something to do. "Can I ask you something?" He asked while slowly moving the knife over the stone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Anything," Rio answered.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why didn't you defend her?" He asked without looking up. "Last night."
    </p>
<p>
     "What is there to defend?" Rio asked. "Nothing they were saying was wrong, Nicky."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas frowned as he moved the knife a little faster on the stone. "She's not a bad person," he defended.
    </p>
<p>
     "She's not," Rio agreed. "But she runs cons like some people change their underwear. And she murdered to gather power. She is ruthless and cunning and a survivor. She is extraordinary."
    </p>
<p>
     "She's my mama," Nicholas whispered. "I just want people to see her like I know her."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached over to rub between her son's shoulders. "Defending her from things she has done, cons she has run, murders she has committed isn't going to get the others to see her the way we do. We have to give her time to let them in and make sure she feels comfortable to do it. If they called her irredeemably evil or a bad mother or something we know she isn't, that's when we defend her."
    </p>
<p>
     "It's hard," Nicholas said as he rested her head on Rio's shoulder. His knife and stone set to the side for now.
    </p>
<p>
     "It is," Rio whispered as she leaned her head against his. "If she can have a coven, one that challenges her on her bullshit, one that keeps her more or less in bounds, one that she can bounce off of with whatever she has to do with the twin teen wonders and Big Red, then she is going to be a more stable version of herself."
    </p>
<p>
     "You want stability?" Nicholas questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm all about balance," Rio reminded him. "I like your mother's brand of chaos and causing some of my own from time to time but at the end of the day my nature is one of balance."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas picked his knife and stone back up. "Can I sharpen yours when I'm done with mine?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes," Rio said as she let him change the topic. "And you can tell me what training Hades and Persephone have put you through."
    </p>
<p>
     -
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha woke up to the sound of voices she bolted upright. She found the others sitting around the now dead fire while Nicholas stood watch with his black cloak back on. She looked around to see everyone was rested and looked ready to head down the road for the next task.
    </p>
<p>
     "Glad you could join us," Lilia said with no bite to her words.
    </p>
<p>
     "We were starting to worry Rio had you under some sort of charm," Alice said with a good natured smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "Who says I don't?" Rio asked as she got up now that Agatha wasn't using her as a pillow anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes as she reached her hand out to Rio to help her up. She was stiff after sleeping but it was nothing a little walking wouldn't fix. "Not in front of others at least," she said with no real fight behind her words as Rio helped her to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     "I wonder what the next task will be," Teen said to move it off of this topic because he was way too gay to think of what that was implying.
    </p>
<p>
     "Spirit, divination and green magic are left," Jen said as she got to her feet. "So 33 percent chance it's any of those."
    </p>
<p>
     "Very perceptive," Agatha said as she buttoned one of the buttons on her jacket. "Shall we?"
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas walked down the road behind everyone while his mothers led the group. He watched the pair closely with a smile hidden behind his cloak. While they weren't doing anything as sappy as holding hands, the back of their hands would graze now and again. Sometimes one would say something and he could almost feel the spark between them hanging in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     He looked next to the coven behind them. Lilia was giving the teen a lecture on all of the ways the mainstream holiday complex changed perspectives on witches while Jen and Alice were talking about something to do with skincare. He wondered if once he was outed to the coven if he could get Jen to help him with his acne. But that was a problem for later.
    </p>
<p>
     Then the next house came into sight. But it wasn't the trail from the prior time they had taken the path. It was a much older house, small and plain with an archway that Agatha passed under going and coming for years.
    </p>
<p>
     Her mother's house.
    </p>
<p>
     "Great," Agatha whispered.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      'Sorry Mama. The road changed what it believes you need to face most.'
     </em>
     Nicholas used his powers to speak directly to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      'The road is going to be put in time out if the road is not careful.'
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Ready?" Rio whispered as her hand reached down to take Agatha's. She knew where they were and knew how taxing this would be.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not one bit," Agatha said with a squeeze to Rio's hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "Who's trial is this?" Teen asked as they all headed toward the little house.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha's?" Lilia guested. "Right time frame for the Salem years."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, it's mine," Agatha said. "This is my mother's house."
    </p>
<p>
     "The same mother you killed?" Jen asked.
    </p>
<p>
     "After her mother and that coven tried to kill her," Rio defended. "Let's not forget her mother is a piece of work the likes of which hasn't been seen on this coast since."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let go of Rio's hand and moved toward the house. She felt more like a little girl than a wife and mother as she walked toward the wooden door she swore she would never walk through the day she left. With a shaky hand she reached up and turned the knob before opening the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Spartan was one way to describe the first foot of the home they were now in. Evanora Harkness was not someone who believed in creature comforts. In both her emotional life and her physical one.
    </p>
<p>
     "So interior decorators weren't a thing in Salem?" Jen asked as they all looked around.
    </p>
<p>
     "No," Agatha said as she looked around. "It all looks the same," she whispered to herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Everyone fanned out on the first floor as they looked for a clue to what this trial was. Agatha looked at the far corner, the farthest away from the stove for heat in the winter and a window for cool, fresh air in the summer, where a thin mattress was with a pillow that was thin and worn and a blanket riddled with holes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Dog bed?" Teen asked as he looked around for the sign of a pet.
    </p>
<p>
     "No," Rio said when Agatha didn't answer. "Agatha's."
    </p>
<p>
     "What?" Lilia said as she turned around to look at the bed and then Agatha and then the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     "My mother wasn't one for giving me anything she didn't think I deserved and she didn't think I deserved much," Agatha said. "Let's figure out what the trial is and get the hell out of here, shall we?"
    </p>
<p>
     Again everyone fanned out to try and figure out what the trial could be.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think I found something," Teen said a few moments later. "But it's in Latin."
    </p>
<p>
     "Give it here," Lilia said, the most comfortable reading in non spell Latin. "Twisted facts and half truths does not a true coven make. Will a coven stand together that knows the truth or will it crumble like ash? Take a trip to the past with your coven to progress forward. Three moments to pick but only one you shall see."
    </p>
<p>
     With the last word three items appeared on the kitchen table. One for each memory they could watch.
    </p>
<p>
     A woman's glove.
    </p>
<p>
     A small stuffed rabbit.
    </p>
<p>
     A black book with carvings on it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't pick..." Agatha said before her voice was taken.
    </p>
<p>
     "The road won't let you tell them what to pick," Rio said when Agatha's voice cut out.
    </p>
<p>
     "Great," Agatha said.
     <em>
      'The road is losing video game time. For a year.'
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Nicholas was more scared of what Agatha was going through than losing his video game time. Are you okay Mama? I didn't expect the trial to change this much but the road is trying to compensate for the changes.'
    </p>
<p>
     'I'm tough, Nicky.' Agatha leaned against Rio slightly as the others debated which item to pick.
    </p>
<p>
     "What do they mean?" Alice asked Agatha that. "Will the road let you tell us that?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Well the book has to be the Darkhold. The Rabbit must be something about Nicholas Scratch. I don't know about the other one though," Jen spoke up.
    </p>
<p>
     "The glove is about Rio." Agatha said as she focused on the objects on the table.
    </p>
<p>
     Teen, Lilia, Jen and Alice all looked at each other and tried to decide what to pick. Agatha tuned out their conversation as she tried to keep from breaking.
    </p>
<p>
     "We've decided on the moment," Lilia said as she reached for the middle object. Once her fingers made contact with the stuffed rabbit, they were transported to the past.

<span>
      Agatha Harkness was a strong person. A survivor. A fighter. She had been to hell and back both metaphorically and figuratively. But standing in a forest and watching a past version of herself walking with a version of baby Nicholas in her arms made her want to curl in a ball. He was crying and she acutely remembered what was about to happen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You look younger," Teen said to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I was," Agatha said dryly. "I was less than 100."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "A child practically," Lilia said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The group watched as Agatha found a coven deep in the woods behind protection charms. She knew she would gain their trust and then turn on them the moment she could. She would drain their powers, kill them, take their food and whatever supplies. It wasn't pretty but she didn't see it any differently than a wolf taking out a deer to survive the harsh winter.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Oh my," Lilia said as she saw the first blast.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Agatha," Alice whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "They trusted you and you turned on them just like that?" Jen asked in shock. "With a baby strapped to your chest?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha made no apology for what she did. How could she try when it would just ring hollow after what they just witnessed? "I did what I had to do to survive," she answered instead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "To gather power you mean?" Jen said with a cutting tone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Same thing," Agatha said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The moment was changed a second later to a few years later but the woods were not so different from where they just were. This time Agatha was holding a toddler in her arms who looked sick and feverish.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "What happened?" Lilia asked. She softened when she saw just how sick the little boy was in Agatha's arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "The flu," Agatha answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Even with a cloaked Nicholas behind her, the little cough she could hear made something deep inside of Agatha break a bit. She remembered even hundreds of years later how sick he had been. How close to death he had come this time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The group watched as Agatha used her magic to make them a shelter and a fire. She went a short walk away to gather some cool river water to dip rags in to try and bring down his fever but nothing worked. Finally in a moment of weakness and desperation, Past Agatha summoned the only person she could think to help Nicholas.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She might be Death but she was also The Green Witch and a powerful healer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Rio," Past Agatha said into the night's sky. "Please, my love. He needs you."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Past Rio, still dressed in brighter shades of green, appeared a heartbeat later. Her torch of sickly green that she carried at night when she came to bring souls was nowhere to be found. Though the coven still hasn't learned that fact about her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You called Rio to heal your son?" Lilia questioned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Rio is that old too?" Alice added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes," Agatha said as she felt her wife's hand on the small of her back. "And older than I am."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio remembered this moment too. She remembered the look of fear in Agatha's eyes that she had to call the very being to heal Nicholas that would someday reap his soul.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It's not his time," Past Agatha said to Past Rio with a plea in her voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "No," Past Rio whispered. "It's not his time."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Past Agatha carefully handed over toddler Nicholas to Past Rio. The little boy let out a cough that shook his whole body. His pale skin almost glowing in the moonlight.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Oh little rabbit," Past Rio whispered. "Let me make you feel better," she said before bending down and pressing a kiss to his forehead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They watched as tendrils of Rio's green magic flowed out of her and into the boy. It wasn't something she could do easily to heal someone. It took all of the love she had for her son to be able to heal his little body. Finally after what felt like a lifetime, she carefully handed him back to Past Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "What the hell?" Jen asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Whoa," Alice whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "He is healed," Past Rio said. "From this illness at least. But his time will come sooner than later."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I know," Past Agatha whispered. "But not yet. Not so soon. He has barely started his life. It shouldn't be snuffed out so soon."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It shouldn't be," Past Rio whispered. "And yet fate has foretold it."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Then change fate!" Past Agatha hissed at her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I have done what I can," Past Rio whispered. She reached a hand down to stroke over Nicholas' now cool cheek.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You may go," Past Agatha whispered. "Thank you for healing him but I want to be alone with my son."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Past Rio looked like she had been slapped at the words and current Rio even gave a wince at the curtness of past Agatha's tone. Wordlessly she stood and with a flash of green she was gone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Harsh," Jen said to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yeah, it was," Agatha said. She turned to Rio and nudged her shoulder to Rio's until she turned so the pair could wrap an arm around each other as if to say she was sorry all over again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I’ve got you, my love," Rio said, reading Agatha's intentions before she pressed a kiss to her hairline. "You were scared and when you're scared your walls are a mile high."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Two miles," Agatha whispered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once again the scene before they changed. They were in the midday sun as Past Agatha and a now six year old Nicholas walked down a path together. It was during Nicholas' creation of the song they had all sung in hopes of opening the road.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Nicholas is who created the ballad?" Alice asked as her eyes went wide and her mind went to her mother.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "He was always a creative boy," Agatha confirmed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The group followed behind mother and son as they headed into a new town and toward a pub. Nicholas sang and performed. A witch saw how thin he was and offered a meal. Soon that same witch was dead along with her coven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They were shown this three times as the seasons changed around them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Each time Agatha watched her past self and her son pull the con with her eyes open. She still believed she was doing what she had to do to protect herself and her son. And she would do it all again to keep him safe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The fourth time was different as Nicholas turned the meal down and ran away. Past Agatha going after him until she found him in the woods.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "He didn't want to con people anymore?" Jen asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Just watch, okay?" Rio said as she knew these moments well. Her arm wrapped tighter around her wife's waist. She really could use a drink or forty-two right now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The group watched as Past Agatha and Nicholas spoke about what he had done and promised to kill more witches the next day. Past Agatha couldn't stay mad at her son and current Agatha longed to turn around and hug him to remind herself he was real.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Day turned to night as the group watched past Agatha and Nicholas fall to sleep together. Mother protectively holding on to her son to try and keep any evil away from him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was then that Past Rio returned. This time her torch in hand.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha turned and pressed her forehead to Rio's shoulder to steady herself before she turned back. She had never seen this moment before and really didn't know but worried if she didn't watch the road would force more on them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Wordlessly, Past Rio called Nicholas to her but then sent him back to press a kiss to Past Agatha's cheek. He gave her one, one for each of them. As Nicholas turned he reached his hand out and took hold of Rio's as they walked into the fog of the woods.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Morning came and the group watched Past Agatha figure out she lost her son. They watched her wail and cry and break at the loss. They watched her dig into the ground and then move rocks over him to protect him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And then they watched as a young woman came up and asked Agatha directions to the Road. The con being born before their very eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The moment broke and they were soon all back in the home of Evanora Harkness.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You made him kiss me goodbye?" Agatha asked as she turned to Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Of course I did," Rio answered. "Then I did what I had to do. His soul was taken to the underworld, it was judged and then...you know the rest."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You're Lady Death," Lilia whispered in both awe and fear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I like being called Rio better when I look like this," Rio said as she turned to the coven.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "This is crazy," Teen said. He had been quiet for most of this but now spoke up. He was trying to wrap his brain around all of this when he went from someone with memory issues to on the Witch's Road with Death themselves.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You wanted the story of Nicholas," Agatha said to him. "There you go. No Darkhold was traded for him, no black magic, I didn't drain him. He died because he was sick, because no force could have saved his mortal soul. Happy?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "We know so many more shades of who you are," Lilia said as she stepped forward. "Understanding is built on being let in."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You did everything you could for him," Alice said as she looked at Agatha. "Like my mother did for me."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Still killed a lot of people to do it," Jen added but the bite had lessened somewhat.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Can we get out of here?" Teen asked. "It kind of gives me the creeps."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes," Agatha said before they headed to the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Before they could get there the ghost of Evanora Harkness appeared and blocked their path. The ghost looked enraged at them all.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "She must be punished!" Evanora demanded.
     </span>

     "Hello Mother," Agatha said as she bawled her hands into fists at her sides.
    </p>
<p>
     "You can't have her," Rio barked.
    </p>
<p>
     "My coven risked everything to kill her. And you fools have willingly joined her," Evanora yelled at the others. "She is pure evil."
    </p>
<p>
     "No, she's not," Alice defended her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You must finish the Witches' Road without Agatha," Evanora said.
    </p>
<p>
     "She means to punish Agatha," Lilia said with a bit of horror in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "Leave her with me," Evanora demanded.
    </p>
<p>
     "What part of no do you not understand?" Rio asked as she reached for her knife.
    </p>
<p>
     “I should have killed you the moment you left my body,” Evanora said. She rushed toward Agatha and took over her body, contorting it and having Agatha speak in tongues as the two fought for control over her body.
    </p>
<p>
     Alice jumped forward with her hands out like she had during the first time they did Agatha's trial only to be shoved to the side before she could be drained.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas gripped his cloak and tossed it to the floor before hitting his mother with the full force of his blast. He wanted to be able to speed up her absorption of his powers.
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora went flying out of the back of Agatha as Nicholas's magic hit Agatha square in the chest. In a flash Agatha had turned the slate blue magic to purple and started to suck his powers toward her to juice herself up.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha, what are you doing!?" Lilia called to her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Who the hell is that?" Jen asked, not knowing who Nicholas was. None of them did.
    </p>
<p>
     "Let her go," Rio instructed. She had to trust Nicholas knew that he could handle Agatha's draw off of his powers. "Nicholas can handle it."
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicholas?" The four others said together.
    </p>
<p>
     "Save all questions for the end," Rio said as she turned back and used her powers to monitor Nicholas just to make sure he was right about Agatha not being able to harm him.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha broke the connection when she sucked more power than she could have gotten from a dozen member coven all in one go. Her hands were covered in her purple magic as Nicholas gave her an ever so slightly weary smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "Use your purple, Mama," Nicholas said when Evanora appeared back in the room.
    </p>
<p>
     "Gladly," Agatha said darkly. She turned around and blasted her mother until the room was covered in a thick layer of ectoplasm.
    </p>
<p>
     The group left the home as soon as they could and found their way to a stream. One they could try and wash themselves off in after being covered in ectoplasm. Agatha and Rio gave them the short and long of what happened prior to Evanora being destroyed. The group looked on with a range of emotions as they took it all in.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     "So just to make sure we have this right," Alice said as they cleaned off. "You two traveled back a day in time after finding out your son was undead in the underworld all this time to prevent us from dying so we could complete the road and be a coven so Billy Maximoff, son of the Scarlet Witch herself, can find his brother who is a soul in the cosmos and we can help train them?"
    </p>
<p>
     "And I put a sigil on William Kaplan after reading his palm seeing something in the future?" Lilia added.
    </p>
<p>
     "And you planned to kill us because you didn't think the Road was real," Jen added. "Let's not forget that part."
    </p>
<p>
     "And I have a soul in a body it wasn't born into," Teen - Billy now - said as he tried to figure out how he felt. At least now a few things made sense.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes," Agatha said as she hung her drenched coat on a tree limb and used her magic to dry it. "Very good, everyone is up to speed. All questions answered."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Lilia said as she started drying herself off. "A moment to process would be appreciated."
    </p>
<p>
     "Fine, fine," Agatha said as she clasped her hands together. "Clean up, dry off and take your moment. I'm going to take a walk to make sure my coat still swishes properly."
    </p>
<p>
     While the others all finished cleaning up, Agatha walked away from the group and found a large oak tree to sit under with her back to the truck. With the rest of the group safely away from her now, she put her face in her hands and allowed a moment of weakness to hit her.
    </p>
<p>
     She froze when she heard someone walking near the tree.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm fine, Rio. I just need a moment," Agatha said in a quiet voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's not Mom," Nicholas said as he took a seat next to his mother. "She was heading this way and I told her I wanted to be the one to comfort you. If that's okay."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wrapped one arm around one of Nicholas' and leaned her head against her son's shoulder. "You may always come and find me no matter what state I'm in. I'm your mother and you're my son."
    </p>
<p>
     "I am your son," Nicholas whispered. "I didn't know how terrible you had it Mama. If I did, I would have prevented her from being here." He wished he destroyed Evanora before his mother even set foot on his road.
    </p>
<p>
     "I needed to face her," Agatha whispered. "She was a terrible mother and teacher. She was right though. My powers are a danger to those around me if I can't control them. And you've given me a way to juice myself up without having to con others. Which will give me back so many hours each day."
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama," Nicholas said. "Why do you do it, really? Kill."
    </p>
<p>
     "Power," Agatha whispered. "If I have enough power then no one can harm me. No one can punish me. No one can make me feel weak or powerless or put me back on that bed on the floor," she said in a rare moment of total truth. But this was Nicholas, her Nicky. If she couldn't be honest with him now how could she look at herself in the mirror? "And because I like the feeling of power. I like the fear. The respect. The things that come with power."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas thought over her answer as they watched the water in the creek flow by. "Can you be happy with another life?" He asked, sounding more like the boy he had been when he saw her last than the man beside her now. "Can you be happy with a coven and training me and Billy? Can you be happy with whatever relationship you and Mom have? Can you be happy not being feared but respected?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I hope so," Agatha whispered. "I really want to be happy with that life, Nicholas. I can't change the past but I will try for the future. A future with less blood stains on the carpet. Even if that's how your mother and I did a lot of our flirting over the years."
    </p>
<p>
     "Can you stick to killing monsters and bad guys when you want to flirt with Mom?" Nicholas asked.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll see what I can do," Agatha promised him.
    </p>
<p>
     “You really do love her, right? It’s not some weird power struggle against an unbeatable force? You two love each other?” Nicholas asked with his more childlike voice back.
    </p>
<p>
     “She and I have a complex history,” Agatha said. She looked down at the golden band on her left hand now. A reminder of years past when Rio created the band with magic Agatha had never seen her use since. “We have hurt and some anger to work out but I have never loved anyone the way I love her. She’s my wife, Nicky. And even if she wasn’t my wife, even if our bond was null, I’m hers. Simple as that.”
    </p>
<p>
     “You belong to Death,” Rio agreed as came around the tree and plopped down in front of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     “Eavesdrop much?” Agatha asked even as she reached out for Rio’s hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio rolled her eyes while she played with Agatha’s fingers. “Love has never been our problem, Nicky. Communication, healthy or at all, a twisted sense of gifts and our nature has been the problem.”
    </p>
<p>
     “And now?” Nicholas asked. “Can you two fix those problems?”
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at her wife with a tenderness that it had been a long time she had felt this sharply. “Yeah, Nicky. I think we can learn how to be a more mature version of ourselves,” she confirmed.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mature?” Agatha scoffed. “You? Rio you go out on All Hallows' Eve in your true form just to scare kids and take their candy.”
    </p>
<p>
     “That is not the point of question, dear,” Rio said with a playful smile. “I think he’s more worried about your murdering and my more destructive tendencies.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Sure she gets to take candy from babies but I don’t get to do some simple murder,” Agatha said in a teasing tone just to see the smirk on Rio’s lips.
    </p>
<p>
     “What am I going to do with the two of you?” Nicholas asked.
    </p>
<p>
     “All of my punishment suggestions are not safe for you to be around for,” Rio smirked.
    </p>
<p>
     “Mom!” Nicholas groaned. “I’m going to go get the others. Can you two behave for like two minutes?”
    </p>
<p>
     “No promises,” Agatha said as she looked from Rio to Nicholas. “But we won’t leave this spot under the tree.”
    </p>
<p>
     Nicholas stood and headed to get the others with the biggest smile he had in years playing on his lips.

<span>
      “So you’re the son of Agatha Harkness,” Billy said to Nicholas as the group walked down the road together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And Rio Vidal,” Nicholas added. “Can’t forget that,” he had a very serious face before cracking a smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No,” Billy said, giving a half smile of his own. “So is there like a support group for kids of witches everyone is scared of?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No,” Nicholas said. “But maybe we can start one? Two for now and then your brother. Maybe see if any of the children of Morgan le Fay are kicking around.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy gave a bit of a nervous laugh. “It’s nice to find someone who understands,” he said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Understand which part?” Nicholas questioned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What it’s like to have a complicated relationship with your mother’s legacy,” Billy said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Nicholas nodded at that because even before his mothers knew he was in the underworld, he had spent a lot of time struggling with who his mother was. He could understand without any support how someone like Billy would struggle even harder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you love her?” Nicholas asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What?” Billy asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wanda, do you love her?” Nicholas asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I…I don’t know,” Billy admitted. “I still don’t remember much and I’ve read about all the horrible things she’s done. It’s complicated to think of what she…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you love your mother?” Nicholas asked to cut Billy off.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes,” Billy finally admitted. “I love her and I wish she was still alive.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is she dead?” Nicholas asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes?” Billy meant it to be an answer but it sounded much more like a question.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey Mom,” Nicholas called up ahead.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, Nicky?” Rio turned around but kept walking next to Agatha, just backwards.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Have you ever met the Scarlet Witch?” Nicholas asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio thought for a moment before shaking her head. “I haven’t had the pleasure yet, no,” she answered.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “R-really?” Billy asked in shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Nope,” Rio said. “Haven’t met her. But if you want to know about her, ask Agatha. She got up close and personal with her.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha reached over and shoved Rio’s shoulder just hard enough to push her off the path slightly but not enough to push her over. “She is my ex….best friend,” she said to attempt to toy with Rio.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You don’t usually go for redheads,” Rio said with an amused look.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I do not want to watch the two of you flirt. Can you go back to trying to kill each other?” Jen asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s cute,” Alice defended them a bit.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Two witches who have bound their souls together often come across to others as slightly annoying but it’s a testament to their bond,” Lilia said.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thank you?” Agatha said over her shoulder. She wasn’t sure she was happy to accept that comment but for now she would.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When Agatha turned back around and the coven moved around a curve, they saw the castle from Lilia’s trial standing in front of them.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well,” Agatha said. “Who’s ready to get their cards read?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s my task?” Lilia asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If it works like last time,” Agatha nodded as she turned to face the others. “Pro tip, don’t just throw cards down on the table if you want to keep from being stabbed with a falling sword.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Thanks?” Alice said with a title of her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Let’s go,” Agatha said before turning back toward the castle and walking her coven toward the penultimate trial.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      -
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The trial had gone more or less the way it had the first time for Lilia. She kept going back and forth in time to learn to come to terms with the past she had predicted but couldn’t change. She saw her teacher, saw that Death came for all but it wasn’t her time yet. It wasn’t any of their times yet.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As she laid down the last card and stopped the swords from stabbing them all, the coven all took in a deep breath. Well except Rio who had been sword fighting with Nicholas with two of the fallen swords.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Done already?” Rio asked as she and Nicholas put the swords down.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You are so unserious,” Agatha said with a roll of her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah,” Rio said with a shrug. “Is that supposed to be news?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How are you, Death?” Jen asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well,” Rio said as she walked over to her. “When two cosmic beings get very, very horny…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Mom!” Nicholas groaned.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry,” Rio said to Nicholas as she stopped that line of thought. She instead showed her true face to Jen. “Do not confuse me enjoying time with my son and coven for me being anything other than the cosmic force of nature than I am. Understood?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Perfectly,” Jen said in a higher pitched voice than she usually had.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Good,” Rio said. Her face returned to normal as she stepped back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “If you two are done, the door is open and we can get out of here,” Agatha said. She was ready to no longer be green even if the hat was pretty incredible.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The coven left the castle and were soon back on the road. There was only one stop left and each knew it would be Rio’s trial.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So,” Nicholas said as he moved in front of the coven. “I think now is a good time for you all to rest,” he said, rubbing the back of his neck.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why?” Billy asked as he looked up from tying his shoe.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because I’ve never had someone like Mom on the road,” Nicholas said. “And the only way to have the test be fair is to bind her powers temporarily so she doesn’t just snap her fingers and finish it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Go see Charon,” Rio suggested. “He can take you to my cottage. Blue bottle with the skull and crossbones on it. Upstairs in my study. If Cerberus is laying on the porch just toss him an arm or leg and that will keep him busy so you can slip in.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That easy to get in?” Nicholas asked in shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Only my blood can get that far,” Rio told him. “Or your mother. So for you, yes. For anyone else? No.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right,” Nicholas said as he took out his knife and cut a hole as he and Rio could both do. “Stay here until I come get you. Then you can finish the road.” With that he was gone.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You’re going to willingly bind yourself?” Jen asked in shock.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “You can bind yourself?” Alice asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Not really?” Rio admitted. “The potion allows me to self-bind. But I can unbind even after taking it. It’s more to allow me to do the trial without using all my powers accidentally.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen took a seat and shook her head. “If I could go back to Boston and find the bones of the doctor who bound me, I could at least maybe figure out some way to get out of this if the road can’t give me my powers back.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Boston you say?” Agatha asked, trying to look uninterested.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah,” Jen looked up, her eyes narrow. “Boston. Have you ever been?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I was raised in Salem. Boston isn’t far,” Agatha said. She paused a moment before rubbing her face. “It was a common con to sell binding spells to mortals at the time. I did the spells and a few other witches I knew sold them. I never knew who they went to.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “For a hundred years I’ve been bound and it was you!” Jen yelled.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Now Jen,” Agatha said as she moved back to give a little space between them. “I didn’t know it was going to you. I was telling the truth when I said I left you alone because of your work.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How could you bind other witches?” Jen asked. “You’re a sociopath sometimes, you know that Harkness.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Look, I needed money and it kept the wheels turning. I only sold maybe fifty or sixty of the binding spells,” Agatha said. She didn’t back up any longer as she knew there was no option other than to let Jen do what she knew she needed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This ends now,” Jen yelled as she walked past the others and over to Agatha. She ripped some of her hair out and gathered her hands to tie the hair around her wrists. “I deny your power over me,” she said. “You hold nothing,” she said over and over again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Finally Jen let the hair go and turned her hands over. Balls of pink formed in her hand as her magic returned to her. She smiled down at her hands before she open hand slapped Agatha as hard as she could across the face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha let out a deep groan at the pain before rolling her shoulders and turning her head back forward. “Feel better?” She asked Jen.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Much, thanks,” Jen nodded as she took a seat again. She teared up as Lilia and Alice sat on other side of her, rubbing her back and trying to ease her through her powers coming back in full.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio walked over and checked Agatha’s cheek before pressing a kiss over the red mark, nipping slightly. “Usually another woman slapping you in front of me would get them a world of pain but you kind of deserved that one,” she said to her wife.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I did. It was a clean shot,” Agatha agreed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How can you just forgive her?” Billy asked, feeling confused.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It’s Agatha,” Jen said as she looked up at him. “She’s a mess and sometimes a bitch but we’re a coven. A mess of a coven but a coven.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No more betraying each other though,” Lilia said as she looked up at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha just held her hands up. “Got it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I’ll make sure she behaves,” Rio saluted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s reassuring,” Jen snorted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio just smiled her demented smile and nodded. “Isn’t it though?”
     </span>

<span>
      Nicholas returned about an hour or so later - though with the way the road worked it could have been days.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Where's the bottle?" Rio asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Change of plan," Nicholas said. "I saw your father down there and he suggested a different trial. One I don't think you'll like much but will need your full powers to do."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Father?" Four voices said together.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I'm his favorite," Rio said before addressing her son. "Is there going to be a new location for this or can we do whatever abomination my father is asking for here?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "He wants the coven to do two tasks," Nicholas said. "Repair the soul riff inside of Billy and create a body for Tommy."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Of course he does," Rio said. It was clear to any of them that Death was not very happy about either task set out before her. "He understands this isn't a trial of still or test of my mental toughness but of my obedience to him, doesn't he?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yeah, yeah I think he is well aware of that," Nicholas nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Terrific," Rio said dryly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "W-what does 'repair the soul riff' mean?" Billy asked nervously.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It means to join the soul of William Kaplan and Billy Maximoff together. You will have all of your old memories, you will have all of his. It will correct the imbalance I feel in you from a cosmic balance point of view," Rio explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And how do we find a body for Tommy and put him in it?" Billy asked with hope in his eyes to see his twin again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "That is for me to figure out and then you and the others to handle. Putting souls in bodies is not in my skill set," Rio said as she looked over to her wife.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I can guide him," Agatha said with a confident nod.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Lilia," Rio said. "I am going to need you to help with some charms to find a boy with a few very specific parameters. Jen, I'm going to need a stamina potion for Tommy, have Alice help gather everything. If you can't find it, I'll force it to grow."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Soon everyone was moving to do what they needed to do to get the final task done so they could finish the road. Rio gave Lilia the parameters and a few pages of Billy's spell book to try and find the right boy for this. Jen and Alice started to gather things.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Nicholas sat down on the ground side by side with Billy while Rio sat in front of him. She had the face of death now. She needed all her power at the ready for this.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Will it hurt?" Billy asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You're going to have a hell of a headache but not seriously," Rio answered with a bit of demonic to her voice that made Billy wince.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Okay," Billy said more bravely than he felt.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Just close your eyes," Rio said. "This is all on me."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Once she was ready, Rio put her skeletal hands on either side of his head. She called forward the soul of William Kaplan from the place he had been resting so she could do the joining. With a power only she had, with the force that only she could muster out of all the brings that had been or ever would be, she forced the souls to merge, creating Billy Kaplan from William Kaplan and Billy Maximoff.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Whoa," Billy said when Rio's hands dropped from his head. He fainted back and was only saved by Nicholas from crashing into the ground.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Give him a few moments before you wake him," Rio said as she got to her feet. "I need to see if Lilia found someone for me to go gather," she said with a tone of distaste.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Nicholas looked up at Rio with her full power on display. Agatha got to her cheek and cupped her boney jaw with her fleshy hand. "I know this hurts. Do it anyway, yeah?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "My father tests the limits of my obedience," Rio complained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And while that's usually my job," Agatha said with a wicked smirk, "you have to do this."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Rio couldn't roll her eyes or curl her lip in this face so she gave a simple nod before she turned and went over to Lilia.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Mom really doesn't like to be told what to do when it comes to souls and death, does she?" Nicholas whispered to Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Understatement of a lifetime, Nicky," Agatha said as she reached over and patted his knee. She then reached over and brushed a bit of hair from Billy's eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Lilia managed to find a boy that fit all of the parameters Rio requested. He was in the foster care system, no one would miss him, he was the right age and body type. And he was about to be very, very dead. Unless Rio went and fetched him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      In a flash she was back and she was holding a teenage boy who was dripping wet and in trunks. Signs of his difficult life on his skin. She carefully set him down. She took the potion from Jen and poured it down the kid's throat before looking at Agatha.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Tag," Rio said as she shook her head and her human face returned. "You're it."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Agatha and Nicholas roused Billy.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Do you remember everything?" Nicholas asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yes," Billy said as he looked from Agatha to Nicholas and back again. "Yes, I remember everything. The battle in Westview, Mom and Dad, Tommy, trick or treating, the hex coming out, being William. I remember it all."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Great," Agatha sat down in front of him and put her hands on his head like Rio had done. "Let's get Tommy in the body Rio brought before you have to dig another grave."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Step by step Agatha walked Billy through finding Tommy's soul in the cosmos. She taught him how to see as if he was Tommy, she taught him how to control Tommy's soul to get it to come closer and closer. And finally she taught Billy how to get Tommy's soul in the body of Thomas Shepherd.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tommy sat up and gasped for air once the soul had entered his body. He looked around scared before Rio bent down and did to him what she did to Billy. She merged the two souls into one, giving the boy both sets of memories. Like his twin he soon passed out.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      With the final task completed the coven all looked around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They all started laughing at just how absurd what they had been through had been.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "We did it," Alice laughed as she looked at the others. "We walked to Witches Road. We did it."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I got my powers back. I unbound myself," Jen laughed as she created a little ball of pink just because she could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And I understand all the things I fought to ignore for so long," Lilia said with joyful tears in her eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And I have my twin back," Billy said as he moved over to Tommy and stroked his hair. "And my memories."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "And I..." Agatha said softly. "I made out very well," she looked at Nicholas and Rio and then down at her hands covered in purple.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Congratulations," Nicholas said as he got to his feet. "You have all completed the Witch's Road. You have been rewarded with your powers, with demons being vanquished, with a coven stronger than any of you could imagine.""
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Are the Salem Seven still waiting for me?" Agatha asked to see how prepared she needed to be.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "The Salem Seven are currently enjoying a little divine fire. I've missed a few rounds of mother's day and I wanted to show you I care," Nicholas explained.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Son of the year," Agatha said as she gave him a tight hug for taking care of that little mess for her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "It was fun," Nicholas admitted.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Yup," Jen said. "He's yours."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Billy bent down and picked up his twin, who was still out cold. "What is going to happen to Tommy? Where will he be?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Oh," Agatha said as she thought about it. "Well I could do a little charm on the Kaplan's and make them think they adopted him?"
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "I can get forged paperwork," Alice offered. "I still know a judge or two who owes me a favor."
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "Teamwork does make the dream work," Lilia nodded.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone looked around for a moment before breaking out into laughter. Agatha and Rio even held hands as they followed Nicholas to where the road would take them back to earth.

<strong>
       Three Months Later
       <span>
</span>
</strong>
</em>
</p>
<p>
     After completing the road, there was a rush of changes made in the lives of the coven members.
    </p>
<p>
     Using her skills of manipulation and Alice's connections for document forgery, Agatha managed to get the home she had been living in sold. She took the money and bought a piece of land in Eastview where a new house was built in the middle of a wooded area. The coven had all helped put charms up to keep them safe and hidden. The land was big enough for a sweet of cottages for Lilia and Alice. Jen was offered one as well but she was not giving her condo up for anything.
    </p>
<p>
     Inside the main house Agatha and Rio had a large suite of rooms on the upper most floor. Nicholas had half of the next floor down. The other half was split up for Billy and Tommy so they had a place to come to whenever they wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     The charm Agatha put on Billy's parents might have included the teens having time to come visit her for some vague tutoring.
    </p>
<p>
     Lilia, with the help of Billy and Tommy, had started a YouTube and TikTok about the history of witches, divination and all of the wrongs she so passionately wanted to correct misconceptions about. It was framed as a dash of history, a dash of mystery and alt history as to not out her completely to the masses.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Alice got her job as a cop back in Eastview which allowed her access to information they may need if any magical trouble started creeping in.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Jen managed to get out from under the lawsuits and open a nature focused birthing center. Something that allowed her to have her own social media pages which reintroduced her to the public in a way that caught fire and paid all those legal fees.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio of course had her eternal career as Death. Nicholas had been learning from her and Agatha both to figure out more about his powers. Rio even let him lead a soul or two by himself when she thought he was ready.
    </p>
<p>
     Billy and Tommy were going to school as they should and coming over several times a week to train with Agatha, Nicholas and the others. They were both quick leaners and brought a sense of focus to the others.
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     And Agatha?
     <span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
     Well when she wasn't training one of the young appearances she was trying to turn what she knew into a series of books. One set for witches and a second set for humans to fund the lifestyle she had become accustomed to. Because who could tell a story better than the queen of manipulation herself?
    </p>
<p>
     "Honey, I'm home," Rio called as she came in the backdoor in her full Death face.
    </p>
<p>
     "How was the earthquake?" Agatha asked as she looked up from the onions that were being chopped by her purple magic.
    </p>
<p>
     "Chaos, madness, mayhem. My favorite things in a natural disaster," Rio said after changing her face human again. "Are you turning back under Big Red's spell? Making dinner and waiting at the door for me to come home?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Your son likes eating food as much as you like eating other things," Agatha smirked. "Billy and Tommy are here training. And the rest of the coven is coming over tonight. Somehow we all managed a night off together."
    </p>
<p>
     "Did the great Agatha Harkness ever think she would be here when she woke up from the spell of the Scarlet Witch?" Rio asked. She wrapped her arms around Agatha and looked into her wife's eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Fuck no," Agatha snorted. "But having Nicky back? Teaching the teen wonders? Having a publisher tell me I'm brilliant twice a week when I go into New York City? Can't say I hate this life."
    </p>
<p>
     "It is nice to see happiness on your face again," Rio admitted. "And being part of it is welcome after our little tiffs."
    </p>
<p>
     "Little tiffs sunk the unsinkable ship," Agatha snorted. "What about you? Has Death been tamed?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Death is all about balance with life," Rio said as her hands trailed over her wife's hips and back to her ass. "The domestic and the sexy. And you, Agatha Harkness are Mother, Maiden and Crone all in one."
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you just call me a Crone?" Agatha asked with a raised eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     "Gonna punish me with a good spanking?" Rio asked as she pulled Agatha in closer.
    </p>
<p>
     "After dinner," Agatha promised before leaning in for a kiss. "We can test the silencing charms we just redid."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled away when Nicholas walked in the kitchen. He was covered in sweat and looked worn out. He headed to the refrigerator to grab some bottled water.
    </p>
<p>
     "Those twins are going to be the death of me," Nicholas said before downing the water.
    </p>
<p>
     "You can't die," Agatha reminded him. "And close the refrigerator door. Who raised you?"
    </p>
<p>
     "You for a while and then two kinda sorta Greek gods who don't know what a refrigerator is," Nicholas said with a smirk that was a perfect blend of his mothers.
    </p>
<p>
     "Go shower before dinner," Rio chuckled.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, Mom," Nicholas said. He bent down and kissed both of his mothers on the cheeks before heading upstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh!" Rio said once Nicholas was gone. "I got you a gift when I was out today."
    </p>
<p>
     "Blood of my enemies? Diamonds? Lightning in a jar?" Agatha tried to guess as her magic opened the door to check the roast. Cooking on magical autopilot really was the best.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled something out of her pocket and gave Agatha her brightest grin. In her hand was a card to Costco with Agatha's name on it.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are such a fucking dork," Agatha said before she started laughing. She pulled Rio in by the collar on her shirt before laying a dizzying kiss on her wife's lips.
