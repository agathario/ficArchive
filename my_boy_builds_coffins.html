<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>A ghost? Really? Now that was low. It felt as if Agatha Harkness had been brought into this world to personally spite Death herself. She treated Rio as a pathetic pawn in one of her countless games. Three centuries of knowing Agatha Harkness. Three centuries of heartbreak, grief, sorrow, betrayal.. Emotions Rio never thought herself capable of feeling. Yet now, those feelings consume her, each one heavier than the last, more overwhelming than anything she has ever known. And right now, they seem to taint every other emotion she had ever felt, scars ripped open at their seams, leaving her bloody and raw.</p><p> </p><p>You know the saying, “Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.” Well, for Rio, when it comes to Agatha Harkness, it’s more like, “Fool me 836,258 times and Rio will still refuse to feel shame” - even if it slapped her right in the face (which, of course, it has.. more times than she cares to count).</p><p> </p><p>It’s a choice, one she makes willingly, time and time again. To play as a pawn in Agatha’s twisted games, knowing full well that Agatha was always up to something that would, without a doubt, ruin Rio. It is the very definition of insanity. Yet, to know Agatha Harkness is to love her. So, call Rio crazy, because there is no universe in which she would ever choose otherwise- eternity be damned. In every life time, in every universe, she would do it all over again. Even if it meant being punched in the gut a million times by Agatha, to then be hit by a bus and dragged through three centuries while Agatha is driving said bus. But hey, three centuries? That’s a very short time when you’ve been around since the universe’s very existence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha never wants to see Rio’s face again, she’s made that abundantly clear. Rio can’t control much, but she can control this. If Agatha wants to play pretend as a mother to some random abomination she hasn’t even known for five minutes, far be it from Rio to stop her. After all, the sacred balance has been restored (a loophole that makes Rio seethe).</p><p> </p><p>Despite everything in the green witch telling her otherwise, this time she will give Agatha what she wants.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Billy and Agatha were somewhere in the Midwest at a record store after another dead end in Billy’s “I wAnT tO fiND mY bRoThER’ quest. They were browsing while trying to kill time, when the front door chimes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely registers it. It wasn’t like anyone could see her, except Teen. She was still adjusting to her new existence as a fresh faced ghost. She had only just begun to make physical contact with inanimate objects, but her attempts so far have been nothing short of pathetic. Awkward and frustrating, each failure a stark reminder of how powerless she feels.</p><p> </p><p>But..</p><p> </p><p>She can feel her purple returning, slowly making its way back to her, a familiar sensation. Though it had taken a few wrong turns along the way, delaying its arrival time, but no need to worry, it will be home soon.</p><p> </p><p>Teen doesn’t seem to mind Agatha’s lack of power; in fact he almost seems satisfied by her predicament.</p><p> </p><p>He has developed a growing ego, fueled by his new found abilities and Agatha’s obvious lack there of. It wasn’t a good look. Nothing ever good came from cockiness. But she let it slide. He’d learn soon enough. For now, she’d lt him enjoy his delusional superiority complex.</p><p> </p><p>“I love that album.” Teen says excitedly. Agatha looks up.</p><p> </p><p>A young woman, maybe in her early 20s, dark brown hair, fair skin, light colored eyes, a bluish green with specks of brown. She stands a few feet away from Teen, her gaze snaps up from the album she was scanning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saunters over and glances down at the album the girl is holding: <em>The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess.</em> She scoffs, “Fitting.”</p><p> </p><p>Teen throws a quick glance at Agatha, then back to the brunette, making sure she’s oblivious to the spooky presence hovering nearby.</p><p> </p><p>The younger woman looks up at him, smiling. Agatha rolls her eyes. “Duuuuuh,” the older brunette drags out, the sarcasm thick in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s so good! I can’t stop listening to it,’ The girl says, her eyes returning to the album in her hands, a small smile tugging at her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Have you heard Subway? It’s an unreleased track, but she performs it at every festival she plays at.”</p><p> </p><p>The girl’s eyes light up at his question, her lips curling into a playful grin, her tongue presses into her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stills.</p><p> </p><p>It almost reminds her of- <em>no</em>.</p><p> </p><p>She’s not opening that can of worms. Agatha chooses peace, and she’s not about to ruin it with thoughts of her relentless ex….</p><p> </p><p>An ex who hasn’t been very relentless for the last nine months. But who’s counting? Certainly not Agatha.. though she does wonder.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s too smart for her not to have figured it out by now. It’s not like Agatha was quiet about it. Since when is Agatha Harkness ever quiet about anything? Still, she expected hell to freeze over the second Rio uncovered that her dead ex was far from being completely dead.</p><p> </p><p>In all fairness, Rio really hates ghosts. Agatha knows this, and she pretends not to be bothered by the fact that this cat-and-mouse game they’ve played for the last three centuries seems to be over- if Rio’s complete and utter silence for the last NINE MONTHS is any indication.</p><p> </p><p>Lady Death has gone AWOL.</p><p> </p><p>Was Agatha’s ‘I don’t want to see your face’ speech a little much? Maybe. Did dying and coming back as a ghost, and fully knowing how much the green witch despised ghosts add a nice, cruel little cherry on top? Probably. But Agatha never believed Rio would just sit idly by while she existed as one of the biggest banes to Death’s existence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been certain Rio would come after them, paranoid even, constantly looking over shoulder, always on the defensive, expecting the green witch to show up at any moment. She’d even warned Teen about the impending wrath they would face once Rio discovered her loophole. But one month turned into two, then three four and five… and still, nothing.</p><p> </p><p>After the six month mark, Billy grew tired of Agatha’s fear-mongering and spat, “Have you ever considered that she wants nothing to do with you anymore? Can’t say I blame her.” Disgust written all over his face.</p><p> </p><p>In that moment, Agatha wanted nothing more than to wrap her hands around the kid’s neck and squeeze the life right out of his annoying little eyes. She tried, of course she tried but ultimately failed miserably. Billy only laughed at her helplessness.</p><p> </p><p>And no, Agatha never once considered that Rio wouldn’t want anything to do with her. But here they were, nine months in to Agatha and Billy’s big adventure and still? Nothing. Nada. Zip.</p><p> </p><p>Not a single sign of her ex lover. Agatha feigned relief.</p><p> </p><p>She has no one to run from anymore, no one to make her life hell. Now, her life was quiet and maybe just a teeny bit less vibrant without Death stalking her every move. She took this newfound peace as a gift. This is what she wanted, right?</p><p> </p><p>Peace had always been a stranger to Agatha. It was something she’d never known, her mother had seen to that. And then, there was Rio. For a while, Rio had been her one exception, offering a fleeting peace, despite her role as Death. That peace had been shattered when she lost Nicky, the son she had killed for, the son she had sacrificed so much to keep alive. And yet, even after everything, when he died, Agatha couldn’t bring herself to face him in death.</p><p> </p><p>Now, with Rio wanting nothing to do with her and Nicky still beyond reach, Agatha sat with the quiet. Wondering if this peace was even real, or if it was just a reminder of the hollow absence of everything she’d lost.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wouldn’t deny that mentoring Billy had helped. It served as a distraction, a small, fleeting moment to make up for centuries of emptiness that she had tried, always unsuccessfully, to fill.</p><p> </p><p>“And in four months if this feeling ain’t gone…” Agatha’s thoughts are interrupted as the young woman begins to sing, and Billy eagerly joins in on the next verse. “Then fuck this city, I’m moving to Saskatchewan!”</p><p> </p><p>They both burst into laughter, their joy infectious. Agatha groans, loud and exasperated.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we go now? This conversation is putting me to sleep.”</p><p> </p><p>Billy ignores her and continues chatting with the girl.</p><p> </p><p>After a few more agonizing minutes, listening to the two of them rave about… “gay pop” ? Agatha’s patience finally snaps. Frustrated, she strides over, positioning herself between Billy and the girl, and attempts (repeatedly) to knock a stack of records off the table. After several aggressive swings and a string of muttered expletives, she finally delivers a sharp, “HI-YAH!” She manages to topple the pile.</p><p> </p><p>The young woman jumps back, startled, giving Billy a puzzled look. Perhaps sensing his lack of reaction, she mutters, “Weird.”</p><p> </p><p>She crouches down to begin gathering the scattered vinyls, while Billy shoots Agatha an irritated glance before scrambling down offering his help.</p><p> </p><p>Once they have finished cleaning up Agatha’s mess, the girl stands, glancing at Billy, “I never got your name.”</p><p> </p><p>“She knows you’re gay right?”</p><p> </p><p>Teen ignores her.</p><p> </p><p>“Billy!” He smiles.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, Billy, it was really nice to meet you…”</p><p> </p><p>“Thank god,” Agatha mutters.</p><p> </p><p>“But I need to borrow your familiar.” The young woman’s gaze fills with mischief as she steps toward Agatha, extending her arm to grab the collar of Agatha’s dress.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha can react, the girl makes contact.</p><p> </p><p>“HEY!” Agatha yells, but it’s too late. She’s already being yanked through a vortex.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="s1">They tumble through the portal, landing with a jarring </span> <span class="s2">thud</span> <span class="s1"> on the hard floor. Somehow, Agatha ends up sprawled on top of this nameless girl (she doesn’t care enough to learn it.)</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Get off me!” Agatha snaps, scrambling to stand.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She disentangles herself as she shoves the younger brunette, back down with unnecessary force- purely for her own satisfaction.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The girl’s, head thuds lightly against the floor, and she groans, pressing a hand to the back of her head. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">As Agatha rises to her feet, she halts abruptly when she comes face to face with a mirror hanging on the wall just a few feet away. Her own reflection stares back at her, eyes unsteady and wide with disbelief. She freezes. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s2">It can’t be.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitates, then slowly closes the distance to the mirror. Her breath catches as she takes in the image staring back at her. It’s her, but not as she remembers. Gone is her translucent, phantom form. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">She looks… </span> <em> <span class="s2">alive</span></em><span class="s1">. </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Her hair, once a dull gray, has returned to its deep brown, save for a single streak of silver. Her clothes are unfamiliar: a rusty tan linen suit paired with a white striped collared shirt.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“What?” she whispers, her voice trembling.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Spinning around, she scans the room with frantic eyes, searching for something, anything solid, something she can touch. The girl is forgotten, her sole focus now on testing the impossible. Her gaze lands on a desk across the room, cluttered with books, journals, and scattered papers.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s2"><em>Bingo</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The girl stands now, brushing herself off with a quiet huff. Agatha’s focus set solely on the desk, she doesn’t spare the young woman a glance, as Agatha’s strides are heavy and determined, her mind consumed with testing her theory. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Without so much as a thought, she brushes past the young woman, Agatha’s shoulder knocking into the girl’s along the way.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The young brunette grunts, “Watch where you’re going, dude,” she grumbles. Her body (and now, a bit of her ego) feels bruised from Agatha’s unnecessary roughness as she rubs her shoulder, trying to soothe the ache.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Get used to it, </span> <span class="s2">Young Adult.</span><span class="s1"> You’re lucky I didn’t throw you through a wall,” she flings out, eyes locked on to the prize in front of her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The girl froze, her eyebrows shooting up, she squares her shoulders and shoots: “Young Adult?..…. Teen?…… For a nearly 400 year old witch, your nicknames really lack depth.” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha doesn’t respond. Her focus narrows as she reaches the desk, slamming open hands onto its surface. Her flat palms curl into tight fists, the loose papers beneath her fingers crumple under her grip. She freezes, curling her fingers tighter as the realization hits her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Her eyes widen in shock. “What?” she breathes, the word barely audible. Then louder, “WHAT?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Spinning around, she stares at Y/A </span> <span class="s2">(<em>Young Adult is a mouthful</em></span><span class="s1">, she thinks), Agatha’s expression filled with a mix of disbelief and demand.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“I know this all seems a bit confusing, but maybe next time we use our big girl words to communicate that, instead of jumping straight to destroying my shit” Y/A mumbles, brows furrowed, as she steps toward the desk and quickly gets to work unwrinkling the papers Agatha crumpled.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha looks at her, mouth agape, dumbfounded.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She had heard whispers of resurrection spells. A dark, forbidden magic, a taboo even among witches. It required vast, almost unimaginable power and, more often than not, a sacrifice. It seemed straightforward enough, but the real danger was in the catastrophic consequences that would follow. It was unlike becoming a ghost or finding an empty vessel to occupy. No, it was something far darker, a perversion of the natural order. A force so corrupt, that even the book of the damned warned against its chaos. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Yet here she stood, knowing no incantation had been spoken, no obvious sacrifice made. They weren’t even where Agatha had been originally laid to rest. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">And the biggest indicator, no Rio. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Let’s be real: if a resurrection spell and Agatha Harkness’s name were ever mentioned in the same breath, Rio would </span> <span class="s2">definitely</span> <span class="s1"> show up, flesh and bone, to deal with it. Even a fleeting thought of resurrecting Agatha Harkness would be enough for Rio to intervene. No witch who dared would get far enough to raise a finger, let alone speak the beginnings of the spell. And Agatha was no fool. She knew Rio had likely tamper-proofed her burial site, ensuring no one could disturb the rest Death herself so carefully prepared for her ex lover. </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha pretends it doesn’t sting. The thought that even after her death, Rio had to take measures to protect herself from Agatha’s disloyalty. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio was more than just the ferryman of souls; she was the keeper of the balance. No one would violate the sacred cycle of life and death. No witch had ever successfully cast a resurrection spell simply because Death had no tolerance for such deviance. She always intervened before any real damage could be done. She was, for all intents and purposes, the ultimate buzzkill, all work and no play when potential resurrection was involved. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Can you think a little quieter? You’re stressing Brucie out.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">This snaps Agatha out of her daze. She glances around the room, her eyes landing on Y/A, who is now across the room with her back to her. Agatha, so lost in thought and confusion, hadn’t even realized the girl had moved.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The younger girl stands before a large glass enclosure, its sleek surface framed by dark, intricately carved wood paneling that adds an air of beauty to its sturdy structure. Agatha immediately recognizes it was designed for a reptile. Inside, the air appears thick and humid, the lush interior filled with life. Twisting branches and sprawling vines reach from the floor to the ceiling, resembling a miniature rainforest. As Agatha’s eyes examine the enclosure further, she notices faint carvings etched into the wood of nearly every branch. </span><em><span class="s2">Runes</span></em><span class="s1">, she realizes, filing the information away for later. Above the enclosure door, a worn gold plaque displays the name </span> <span class="s2">Brucie</span> <span class="s1">in elegant cursive, a little tarnished but still legible.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Y/A turns back toward Agatha, cradling a stunning green tree python in her arms. The serpent, about four feet long, has a slender, muscular body and a broad, triangular head. Its piercing red eyes gleam with an almost otherworldly intelligence. “Do you want to hold her?” the girl asks, offering the vibrant creature with a faint, knowing smile.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“No, I don’t want to hold her,” Agatha snaps, her tone dripping with mockery as she steps back. Her piercing blue eyes lock onto the girl. “Tell me who you are and what you’ve done to me,” she demands, her voice hard.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The girl smiles slyly, cradling the snake closer. “You like it, right? Personally, I think you’ve never looked better.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“That doesn’t answer my question. Try again,” she snaps, her voice loud and unyielding.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“I’m Sage,” her green eyes briefly flick to the side. When she looks back at Agatha, the playful smile on her lips fades into a downright shit eating grin. “I give to the undeserving.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha freezes, her mind spinning. The audacity of the girl using her own words against her sends a fresh surge of fury through her. Agatha folds her arms tightly across her chest, her stance rigid.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Oh? You think you’re clever,” she spits, leaning forward and dipping her head to lock </span> <span class="s2">‘Sage’ </span> <span class="s1">in an icy, unrelenting gaze. “Huh?” she barks, her voice cutting like a blade.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Sage doesn’t flinch. Instead, that same infuriating, shit eating grin stretches wider across her face. She nods enthusiastically, her tongue pressing smugly against her cheek. She rocks up onto her tiptoes for a fleeting moment before settling back down, as if struggling to contain her excitement. The girl looks like she might combust at the anticipation of <em>poking the bear</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze shifts to the snake still curled in Y/A’s arms. It slithers up her chest, moving gracefully to the back of her neck, its head tucking into the hollow where her neck meets her left shoulder. The lower half of its body wraps comfortably around the girl’s bicep, coiling as if it belonged there.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha’s shoulders sag, a strange, inexplicable comfort settling over her. It almost feels as though she, not the girl, were the one being cuddled by the snake.</span> <span class="s1"><br/></span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1"><em>Brucie. Stupid name</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Brucie has that effect on people,” the girl says sweetly, her finger gently stroking the snake’s head. “She can be very comforting. Isn’t that right, Brucie? Sorry the mean lady doesn’t want to hold you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Stop talking.” Agatha pinches the bridge of her nose, fighting back an exasperated sigh. She turns sharply, distancing herself from this </span> <span class="s2">Sage person</span><span class="s1">. She needs a moment to regroup, to clear her head, to try and make sense of this mess. The child, with her cryptic words and maddening attitude, isn’t helping.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She takes a moment to absorb her surroundings. The room is bathed in a shadowy green, with dark colored walls. Plants in various shades decorate the room. Books of all kinds -about history, science, magic, and more- are scattered haphazardly across nearly every available surface their pages well worn from frequent use.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">It is as if the room itself was breathing. It’s all so… unsettlingly familiar.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s2"><em>Organized chaos</em>, </span> <span class="s1">Agatha thinks. </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A bed is shoved into one corner, its mismatched linens half hidden by a pile of neatly folded clothes. A desk sits nearby, just a few feet away. Above it is a window, one Agatha hadn’t noticed earlier, too distracted by everything else around her. She walks over to it, hoping it might offer some clue as to where she is.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She peers out, only to be met with vast fields and dense forest stretching endlessly. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s2">Well then, no answers there.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Her gaze shifts back to the desk, it’s carefully constructed disarray. She scans the organized clutter, searching for something, anything, that might provide a clue. Her eyes land on a small, brown leather-bound journal tucked among papers, and she reaches for it. But just as her fingers brush the cover, a hand catches her wrist, Sage’s grip firm. It stops her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“That’s my collection of graphic smut I’ve written over the years, so if you value your blue eyeballs, I’d suggest leaving it alone,” Sage says, her tone suddenly serious for the first time. “Nosiness doesn’t suit you,” she adds with a casual shrug, her grip on Agatha’s wrist still steady.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha wrenches her hand free, her glare sharp enough to cut. “I want answers. Now!” she demands through gritted teeth.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Well, maybe if you’d ask nicel-”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You’ve exhausted my patience. Now, </span> <span class="s2">talk!</span> <span class="s1">” Agatha growls, slamming her fist against the desk with a force that reverberates through the room. </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Brucie reacts instantly, letting out a sharp hiss, her crimson eyes narrowing in warning, mouth bearing fangs like twin blades. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s eyes widen and she jerks back unintentionally putting some distance between the two. The snake visibly relaxes and coils tighter around the younger woman.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Fine, geez. Just let me…” The girl sighs dramatically, untangling the snake from her neck and lowering it gently to the floor. They both watch as it slithers away through the gap beneath the door.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The older woman stares blankly at the girl, Sage shrugs nonchalantly, “She takes care of the rodents.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha scoffs, “By the way, I’m no one’s familiar, and I’m not fucking nosey. Call me either of those things again, and I’ll rip out your fucking tongue.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Relax,” Sage drawls, rolling her eyes. “Pull the stick out of your ass and learn to take a joke. As for how you’re here, you’re… reanimated?” Perhaps struggling to find the right word. “Essentially, you’re not alive, but you have a physical presence.” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s eye twitches, her wrath barely contained. She has to keep herself from snapping- she’s finally getting some kind of answers, and she doesn’t want to blow it.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Which,” the girl continues, ignoring Agatha’s rising tension, “you were bound to figure out eventually. I just, </span> <span class="s2">como se dice</span> <span class="s1">, loosened the jar.” She makes a mocking gesture, twisting her hand as though opening a jar. “Resurrection? ….. Below me. It’s unnatural. Plus, I value my sanity.”</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The phrase hits Agatha like a punch to the gut- another one of her own lines, twisted and thrown back at her. But it’s the last thing the girl says that truly grabs her attention.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Another question, Madam President of the Agatha Harkness fan club?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Shoot.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“You a green witch?” Agatha asks, holding her breath. The thought of Rio lingers at the back of her mind.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The girl pulls her bottom lip into her mouth, suppressing that same shit eating grin from earlier. “Something like that, yeah.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha scoffs. “Figures.” Resurrection was a taboo subject, but green witches, especially, had egos about it- like they were too good to even consider bringing someone back. Same old bullshit about the sacred balance.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She was about to press further when a door downstairs slams shut. Followed by loud tumbles and muffled yelps.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">For the first time since their encounter, Agatha sees panic flash across the girl’s face. Agatha’s own heart races. “Who is that?” she demands, hearing footsteps begin to echo up the stairs.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The girl holds up a hand, her voice low but firm. “Now, you’re gonna listen to me, and listen well. She won’t be able to see you, so don’t do anything stupid.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha purses her lips, crossing her arms, ready to protest.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Agatha, I’m being serious. It’s in your best interest to shut up so I can focus.” Agatha chews on the inside of her cheek, looking out the window but quickly glancing back to Sage. She relents, giving a slight nod.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Sage mutters something in Latin, her voice low and steady. She extends a hand toward Agatha, her thumb brushing lightly against her forehead. For a brief moment, the air around them seems to shimmer before Agatha disappears completely, as if swallowed by the space itself. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The world is no longer noticing her, though she can still see everything around. A ghostly familiarity that unsettles her deeply. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A knock on the door echoes through the eerily silent room.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Sage turns, “Com- ” Her voice cracks, and she clears her throat. “Come in!”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Nice save,” Agatha whispers sarcastically.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Shut up,” the girl snaps, whipping her head around to shoot Agatha a glare that could kill, hissing through her teeth.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1"> Then, the door creaks open slowly, the sound dragging out in the thick silence. Every second feels like an eternity to Agatha, her heart pounding in her chest as she holds her breath, staring at the door. The anticipation is unbearable, the tension in the air palpable. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">And then, she sees her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s2">Rio. </span></em>

<p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><em>Rio</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But they aren’t face to face. Her back is to them as she slowly pushes the door open with her left hand, retreating into the room in cautious, deliberate steps. Her cloak conceals her frame, its edges sweeping the floor. The hood is down, her dark hair visible, but her face remains unseen.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha doesn’t need to see her face. She knows. She’s always known. Every detail of Rio, the way she moves, the energy she carries.. It all feels like a memory burned into her soul.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her breath catches, and her body freezes in place, refusing to obey. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><em> <span class="s2">Run,</span></em> <span class="s1"> her instincts scream, but she can’t. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She doesn’t know if she wants to run toward Rio or away from her. She wants to fight, to demand answers, to scream. </span> <em> <span class="s2">How could you walk away from me? </span> </em> <span class="s1">The memory of their final kiss sears into her mind, it sends a shiver down her spine.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Petal,” Rio drawls, her voice a low, dangerous rasp. She doesn’t turn, still stepping backward into the room. A broom juts out in her right hand, held at arm’s length as though she’s warding off some invisible plague, the broom trembling with her panic.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Yeah?” Sage swallows hard, her tone wary, betraying a flicker of unease.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio steps further into the room. Bite marks trail up her left arm, fresh and bleeding, her grip on the doorknob white knuckled.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze darts to the end of the broom. Just beyond the doorway, Brucie, sits tightly coiled, her vibrant green scales gleaming in the dim light. At the sound of Rio’s voice, the snake jolts toward her, hissing violently. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio yelps, her voice shaking with fear, “Take her. Take her now!” Her words rush out in desperate panic.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Okay, okay,” Sage mutters, making her way toward the angry snake. The moment Brucie spots her, the snake’s tense body visibly relaxes. Sage extends her arm, calm and steady, allowing Brucie to slither up with ease. The snake coils itself into the same familiar position from earlier, nestling snugly into the crook of Sage’s neck as if it had never left. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The broom the original green witch holds clatters to the floor.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As Sage moves past her, Rio flings herself violently against the wall, pressing flat to put as much distance as possible between herself and the reptile.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha would’ve laughed, if this were happening under any other circumstances. She had never seen Rio scared of anything. Death herself, terrified of a snake? It was absurd. Comical, even.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And yet, the realization settles deep within her. She doesn’t know Rio anymore. The thought gnaws at her, mean and unforgiving. They had only spent a fleeting 24 hours together on The Road, just enough time to remind her of everything she had lost. And before that, it had been nearly two centuries since they’d last met. Two centuries Agatha had ensured with the Darkhold.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha hid from Rio behind the Darkhold, but the destruction she left in her wake told a different story. Every life she took, every ruin she created, felt like a twisted love note to Rio- a silent confession whispered into the aftermath: </span> <em> <span class="s2">I love you. I’m sorry.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><em> <span class="s2">I just saw too much of him in you,</span> </em> <span class="s1"> Agatha thinks. </span> <em> <span class="s2">I couldn’t stand the sight. It was suffocating, coiling around my neck, tightening until I couldn’t breathe. It hurt too much… far more than I could bear.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">I was a coward. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Yet here she was, standing face to face with Rio under circumstances so strange they defied reason. The questions churned in Agatha’s mind, unrelenting. Who was this girl to Rio? It was obvious they were familiar. Comfortable, even. What had made Rio deem her special enough to keep around?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t like people. She preferred solitude. Always had. Was she mentoring the young green witch? The thought gnawed at Agatha, stirring something uncomfortably close to jealousy deep within her. Yet, she couldn’t hold onto the feeling long enough to understand it. She had no answers. Worse, she couldn’t even begin to piece them together. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Because now, she could see Rio’s face. And just like that, her resolve unraveled.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The sight consumed her completely, leaving no room for coherent thought. Her mind, her questions, her anger. Everything faded, leaving only Rio. There was no quip to interrupt her, no sarcastic jab to pull her focus. For the first time in too long, she had the luxury of simply looking. Studying every detail.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She had all the time in the world. And yet, it still didn’t feel like enough.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio wears the same outfit she had on the day Agatha swore she never wanted to see her face again- only to be kissing her less than half an hour later. Then dying, clinging to life, and praying Rio’s face to be the last thing she ever saw.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Except now, Rio’s hair was disheveled, and her crown sat askew on top of her head. The raw, bleeding bite marks on her arm made it seem as though she had just stepped off a battlefield.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">That explains the commotion downstairs earlier. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“How did you piss her off this time?” Sage’s words jolted her from her thoughts, yanking her back to reality. She glanced over to see the girl fussing over Brucie, carefully settling the snake back into her enclosure.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“How did I piss her off? I walked through the front door of my own house, and the damn thing fell on my head and attacked me!” Rio snapped, her voice fills with irritation as she gestured to the fresh bites on her arm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha quickly realizes Brucie’s antics were a distraction, giving Sage time before Rio could figure out what was really happening upstairs.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">Though that isn’t what caught Agatha’s attention. </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">My house.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">They were in Rio’s realm- a place Agatha had never seen before, it was the middle ground between life and death. She had asked about it once, long before everything fell apart. Rio’s response had been firm: a curt </span> <span class="s2">no,</span> <span class="s1"> followed quickly by an explanation that it was nothing but an endless green void. After that, Agatha hadn’t pressed the matter again. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha feels her stomach sink, a heavy weight settling in her gut. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I don’t believe that. She’s only ever been an angel,” Sage retorts defensively. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“To you. That thing hated everyone who ever touched it on the surface. If anything, it should be thanking me… I saved it from that 30 year old man-child living in his mother’s basement,” Rio snapped, her voice rising as if she were talking directly to the snake, demanding gratitude Brucie would never give.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha vaguely recalls Sage offering Brucie for her to hold, the memory sharp with the girl’s playful smile. She scoffs internally, realizing Sage had known full well the snake wasn’t friendly and had likely known the older witch was going to be bitten. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha watches as Rio moves with purpose, suddenly heading straight toward her. Startled, Agatha quickly side steps, and Rio brushes past her, completely oblivious to her presence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio strides to the window, scans the view outside, and then turns sharply to Sage, who stands in front of Brucie’s enclosure, now facing Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Is someone here?” Rio asks, her voice cutting through the room like the blade attached to her hip. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s breath catches, and she holds it tight, as though even the slightest exhale might give her away. It’s a fragile stillness, the kind that comes when you’re seconds away from shattering. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What? Why would anyone be here?” Sage responds smoothly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t help but feel impressed. Sage’s face never faltered, giving absolutely nothing away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio saunters toward Sage, arms crossed, her tone casual but probing. “Oh, nothing. Just thought I saw someone up here with you when I was coming in… Caught a glimpse through the window.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hate to say it, but you might be losing it in your extreme old age. Blind, senile… Take your pick,” Sage teases, her grin knowing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio laughs, the sound low and rich, carrying an ease that feels natural between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha forces herself to look away, pretending she doesn’t adore the effortless way they fit together, even as it stirs something deep inside her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It’s like someone pounding on a door, shouting for her to wake up, the noise reverberating through her body and shaking something she’s not ready to face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’ve got that look on your face,” Rio sing-songs, twirling a finger teasingly in front of Sage’s face. Rio taps the girl’s nose softly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">From where Agatha stands, she has a perfect view of both of them. Their easy dynamic, the shared history she isn’t part of.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s brow furrows, her tone genuinely offended. “What look?” She swats at Rio’s hand. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“The look you get when you’re hiding something from me, Petal,” Rio teases, her brows lifting and her chin tilting ever so slightly, a smirk plays on her lips. The original green witch is thoroughly entertained, patiently waiting to see what Sage will say next.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
<span class="s2"><br/><em>Petal. </em> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The second time she’s heard that nickname. It makes Agatha’s ears ring, a piercing note that won’t settle. She can’t keep up, can’t make sense of any of it and a part of her isn’t sure she even wants to.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Well, I don’t hide anything from you, so </span> <span class="s2">‘that look on my face’</span> <span class="s1"> doesn’t exist,” Sage declares. She purses her lips, her expression one of conviction, like she fully believes her own defense.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Doesn’t matter. I know my daughter well,” Rio says with a calm certainty.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sh- ” Sage flinches, her hands shooting up to clap them over Rio’s mouth, but they freeze midway, trembling slightly between them, caught in indecision.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">And there it was.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The answer Agatha had been unconsciously, perhaps deliberately, avoiding. The words hit her like a freight train, knocking the air completely from her lungs.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">A daughter.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her mind spins, a thousand questions colliding at once, an avalanche of disbelief. It’s too much, too fast, and the pieces refuse to fall into place. She can’t make sense of any of it. Agatha is stuck again, unable to move, her body betraying her as she watches everything unfold before her eyes. It feels inevitable, like fate mocking her yet again. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Another tragic ending to her on-again, off-again love affair with Death, she’s sure of it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What did you do?” Rio’s brows knit together at Sage’s reaction, confusion etched across her face. Her gaze sharpens as she catches Sage’s eyes darting to the side to where Agatha stands, only for a moment, before snapping back to her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Realization dawns, dark and sudden. Rio steps back, putting distance between herself and Sage, her movements deliberate. She pulls her hood over her head, and in a split second, Rio is gone-replaced by Death, the air around her seeming to darken and shift. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Death pulls her cloak tightly across her chest, the movement swift and instinctive, shielding her black heart from the unseen blow.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Get her out. Now!” Death’s voice booms, loud and commanding, echoing through the otherwise silent room. The sound makes both Agatha and Sage jump, their hearts pounding.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Well, I don’t think I can really do that with the bomb you just- ” Sage starts, her words rushing out in a frenzy, but Death is already heading for the door.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Now, Sage!” she roars, her tone leaving no room for argument. As she exits, a flick of her wrist sends the door slamming shut behind her, the sound reverberating like a final warning.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage turns slowly to face Agatha, her expression unusually serious. She lets out a long, measured breath, the air seeming to shift with the sound.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha feels it immediately. The subtle shimmer of magic dissolving around her, the weight of the invisibility spell lifting. She’s exposed now, fully seen, and her heart pounds in her chest as Sage meets her gaze, unflinching.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“La petite mort,” the girl declares, dipping into an exaggerated curtsey. Her arms extend wide, her legs cross dramatically, and her head dips low, like she’s making a grand introduction to royalty.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha exhales an exhausted laugh, rubbing her temples. “That’s not what you think it means,” she grumbles out. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage straightens with a smug grin. “Oh, I’m pretty sure I know </span> <span class="s2">exactly</span> <span class="s1"> what it means.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha narrows her eyes, not sure whether to be amused or horrified. “Then you might want to rethink introducing yourself as </span> <span class="s2">The Little Death</span> <span class="s1"> like it’s a badge of honor.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage shrugs, “It’s poetic, isn’t it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha groans, muttering under her breath, “Poetic, sure. Just pray no one speaks fluent French.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The reminder that Sage is Rio’s daughter hits Agatha like a physical blow, knocking the air from her lungs once again. </span> <em> <span class="s2">How? When? Why?</span> </em> <span class="s1"> The questions swarm her mind, relentless and unanswered. But one thought rises above the chaos, glaring and impossible to ignore, refusing to be silenced.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And in true Agatha Harkness fashion, she latches onto it, letting it consume her. Anger flares so deep in her chest it feels like she might burst into flames, the heat of it threatening to burn her from the inside out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha storms to the door, throwing it open with a force that makes it rattle on its hinges. She steps into the threshold, her head snapping from left to right as she scans the unfamiliar surroundings. Her frustration only deepens, she has no idea where she is or which way to go.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Stairs are to the left!” Sage calls from her room, her voice carrying with an almost gleeful lilt. Without hesitation, Agatha pivots and follows the direction, her anger propelling her forward. As she steps further into the hall, she hears Sage whisper to herself, “Oh, we are so back,” followed by the sound of hurried footsteps scrambling after her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">By the time Agatha reaches the bottom of the stairs, she spots Rio with her back to her, one hand on the doorknob, poised to leave.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hey!” Agatha barks.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio freezes but doesn’t turn around, her posture stiff and unreadable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha feels Sage brush past her, the younger woman moving to what seems to be a living room,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>leaping over the couch with casual ease and grabbing the remote to turn on the television. Sage’s focus shifting entirely to the screen, ignoring the tension brewing between the two older women.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze snaps back to Rio, who still hasn’t moved, her back facing her. She notices now that Rio has changed. Her imposing cloak and dramatic costume replaced by an unexpectedly casual outfit: a black hoodie, gray shorts, white tube socks, and tennis shoes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her hair catches Agatha’s eye next. It’s tied back in a ponytail, the color lighter than Agatha has ever seen- softer, more natural, as if it had been kissed by the sun. The sight is strange, almost foreign, yet unmistakably Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Death pulls her hood up, the movement swift and deliberate, blocking any fleeting glimpse Agatha might have caught of Rio beneath it. It’s a shield, a barrier slammed into place, shutting Agatha out completely.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Look at me!” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Not happening,” Rio replies flatly, her posture still stiff as she keeps her focus on the door.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Why won’t you show me your face?” Agatha’s voice cracks, desperation bleeding into her words, rasping at the edges. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">In all the time they’ve known each other, never once has Agatha Harkness had to chase Death. And now, with the tables so thoroughly turned, she hates every fucking second of it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio exhales heavily, her shoulders sagging slightly but still refusing to turn. “Do I really need to remind you of what you made me promise?” Her words are quiet, pointed, and laced with something that feels a lot like hurt.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I- ” Agatha’s voice falters, cracking under the weight of her emotions. “I didn’t mean it like that,” she says, softer now, her words a plea.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh, and you mean it differently, now?” Rio snaps, spinning around just enough for the edge of her hood to shift. Her arms are crossed, her posture defiant, like a child refusing to admit they’ve been hurt. “Make up your mind, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha’s anger ignites, consuming every other feeling in a white hot rage. Her voice sharpens, venom lacing every word as she spits, “I want to see your face when you tell me what whore you knocked up and what made them so special… Special enough for you to bend the rules for </span> <span class="s2">your daughter</span> <span class="s1"> when you refused to for </span> <em> <span class="s2">my son.</span><span class="s1">”</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words hang in the air like a slap, heavy and unrelenting, the bitterness behind them impossible to miss.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The reaction is instant, and exactly what Agatha had been hoping for. Even beneath the face of Death, she can see the sheer agony that flashes behind Rio’s eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Fuck you,” Rio snarls. She stomps toward Agatha, closing the distance between them in seconds. “I gave you all I had! And for the last </span> <span class="s2">fucking</span> <span class="s1"> time, he was </span> <em> <span class="s2">our son!</span></em><span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With that, Rio shoves her, hard, the force knocking Agatha off balance, and storms out through what Agatha assumes to be the front door, slamming it behind her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha lets out a frustrated yell, her voice echoing in the empty space. She throws her arms down, willing her purple magic to spark, to flare, to do </span> <span class="s2">something</span><span class="s1">, but nothing comes. The absence of power cuts deeper than she expected, and her legs give out beneath her, sending her to her knees. Exhaustion floods her body.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She deserved the shove. Hell, she deserved more, if she was being honest. She’d crossed a line, one she regretted the moment the words left her mouth. But wasn’t this what they always did? Hurting each other in ways only they knew how. A twisted pattern that neither of them could seem to escape.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1">Was it worth it?</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha doesn’t know anymore. The fiery satisfaction she once felt when her words sliced through Rio has dulled into a hollow ache. She’s fizzling out, the fight draining from her, leaving her tired,<em> so tired</em>. The </span> <span class="s3">intense</span> <span class="s1"> energy that once fueled her, the spark that once burned for the chaos between them, feels like it’s slipping away, leaving only emptiness behind.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re such a fucking idiot,” Sage’s voice slips through the air. Agatha looks over to where Sage had been sprawled casually on the couch moments ago. She’s standing now, arms crossed, disappointment etched clearly across her face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Please, spare me,” Agatha bites out, her tone dripping with sarcasm, “The last thing I need is another child following me around acting like they’re above me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s shoulders slump, a quiet exhale escaping her lips as she stares at Agatha with a look that’s both knowing and painfully sympathetic. She understands exactly what Agatha means, even if Agatha doesn’t want to admit it herself. Then, without warning, Sage’s face lights up, her eyes sparking as though a lightbulb has just gone off in her head.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I can show you,” Sage says suddenly, her voice cautious, like she’s testing the waters.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s response comes in a bitter laugh, “And what exactly could you show me?” she snaps, though the edge in her voice wavers with exhaustion.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Memories,” Sage says, taking a step closer. “I can show you how this all happened. Yeah?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words hang in the air, and for a moment, Agatha doesn’t move. But there’s a flicker of something -curiosity, or maybe desperation- that dulls the sharpness in her gaze.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You can do that?” she asks, her tone softer now, disbelieving.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You just have to let me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There’s a beat of hesitation, the kind that stretches long enough to feel like eternity. Then, with a resigned sigh, Agatha rises to her feet. She crosses into the living room with purpose, her heels clicking softly against the floor, and stops in front of Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her nod is reluctant, but it’s enough.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage smiles wide, her tongue pressing into her cheek, a nasty little habit that Agatha now recognizes all too well. It’s one she inherited from her mother, and the resemblance stings more than Agatha wants to admit.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The sudden shift in energy jarring as she squeals with excitement. The sound grates against Agatha’s nerves, and she huffs, her patience fraying. “Just get on with it,” she mutters.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s hands are already outstretched, fingers wiggling, waiting. Agatha places her own into them, the weight of the moment sinking in as their fingers briefly touch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage takes a breath, steadying herself. She gently lifts Agatha’s hands, guiding them until they rest lightly on either side of her own head. The moment Agatha’s palms make contact, a spark of energy courses between them, like static, quick and electric.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then it happens.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Both of their heads snap back violently, as if pulled by an invisible force. Agatha’s breath catches in her throat, and Sage’s chest heaves as she gasps for air, each inhale short and ragged. Her eyes flutter, struggling to stay focused as they roll back, whites showing against the strain. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s grip tightens around Agatha’s hands, as if holding on was the only thing keeping her from drowning alive. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Quit… fight… ing me…” Sage chokes out, her voice barely audible over the sound of her own labored breathing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha, instinctively resists. But Sage’s strained plea snaps her out of it. She closes her eyes, forcing herself to release the tension, to stop fighting.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The change is immediate.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">In an instant, the room dissolves around them, reality shattering like glass. They’re swallowed whole, consumed by an endless void of green that pulses and shifts like living energy. The air feels alive, heavy with magic, as they’re carried deeper into its depths.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1">So it begins. </span> </em>

<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha and Sage stood in the void of green nothingness. The air was still, thick with a power that felt alive. It was exactly how Rio had described her realm. Beneath their feet stretched a cobblestone path, glistening faintly as though wet, though there was no water, no rain, no sky to speak of. Ahead of them, a figure cloaked in black stood motionless, its back turned.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s chest tightened. Something about the figure was magnetic, a pull she couldn’t resist. Her feet moved instinctively. The closer she drew, the heavier the air became.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Wait.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s hand shot out, grasping Agatha’s wrist with surprising strength. Agatha stopped mid step, her heart pounding. She turned her head, brow furrowed, and found Sage’s face set in an expression of calm determination that felt out of place for someone so young.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What are you doing?” Agatha hissed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Not yet,” Sage replied. Her voice was soft, but her grip didn’t loosen.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha frowned and glanced back at the figure, who hadn’t moved an inch. A tangle of emotions churned in her chest, curiosity, dread, and an undeniable sense of familiarity.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I think I should let you, you know, walk this road alone,” Sage said softly, her tone almost apologetic. “But I’ll meet you at the end when you’re ready, okay?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha blinked, thrown by the sudden shift. “What are you talking about? Why would you leave me now?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage gave a small shrug, “Because this is something you need to do without me. And, honestly…” She hesitated, her green eyes flicking to the figure ahead, “I don’t think I’d be much help if I came along.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s jaw tightened. She wanted to argue, to demand an explanation for this cryptic nonsense, but she knew Sage was right. There was a weight in the air, a burden that wasn’t Sage’s to carry or to interfere with. Whatever lay at the end of the path was Agatha’s and Agatha’s alone.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Still, Agatha couldn’t shake the unease curling in her chest. “And what if I’m not ready?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s lips twitched, the faintest hint of her usual confidence returning. “Then I’ll wait longer.” A beat of silence and Sage continues, “But you have to promise me when it’s over, you’ll act like the centuries-old adult you are. No fighting, no mean words, no stupid decisions. Nothing. Just… try to handle it with some dignity, okay?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha huffed a breathless laugh despite herself, “No promises.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I wouldn’t expect anything less.” Sage smiles. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha walks the path ahead and recognizes the figure immediately. It’s Rio. She’s wearing </span> <span class="s2">that</span> <span class="s1"> dress. The one Agatha remembers so vividly from centuries ago. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Once, she had loved it. It was beautiful, a vibrant green that seemed to radiate life. It reminded her of a time when Rio, despite her role as Death, had still held onto pieces of herself that felt alive. She looked so young. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But now, Agatha can’t stomach the sight of it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It’s the same dress Rio wore when she appeared at Nicky’s birth, when she stood silently in the corner, watching with that knowing expression. It’s the same dress Agatha imagines Rio wore the night she came to take Nicky away, like a thief in the dark, denying Agatha a chance to say goodbye.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Yet, this dress is different. Its vibrant green is gone, replaced by a mournful black that clings to Rio. It reeks of grief, of loss, of regret. Rio’s cheeks are streaked with dried tears, her face hollow with the weight of something unbearable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This must be after she walked Nicky into the afterlife.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s head is bowed, her gaze fixed on something below. Agatha instinctively follows her line of sight, and her breath catches.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">An infant lies nestled in a basket, surrounded by a bed of flowers that seem to bloom and curl protectively around it. The child’s tiny chest rises and falls with soft, steady breaths, and Agatha feels her heart twist in a way she isn’t prepared for.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She glances back at Rio, searching her face for an explanation, but it’s unreadable, a mask of indifference, though the tear stains on her cheeks betray her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“My realm is no place for a child,” Rio mutters. She makes a small clicking noise with her tongue, as if to startle the infant away. “So scram.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The baby’s response is immediate. Instead of fear, a high-pitched giggle escapes its lips. Tiny hands reach up toward Rio, fingers curling and uncurling as if asking to be held.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio steps back, her fingers twitching in the air as though trying to shoo the child away. “Go on now, run along,” she says, her voice softer now, her hands making quick dismissive gestures.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The child only giggles again, her laughter bubbling up like sunlight piercing through the shadows of Rio’s realm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio groans, the sound low and frustrated. It’s obvious now, this child isn’t going to magically sprout legs and walk away. She exhales sharply, glancing around the endless expanse of her realm, as if expecting someone, anyone, to explain this absurdity. But there’s nothing. Just her, the void, and the infant.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This was uncharted territory. No one had ever stepped foot in her realm uninvited. No living soul had even </span> <span class="s2">tried</span> <span class="s1">. And yet, here this child was, arriving seemingly out of nowhere, mere moments after she’d walked her son into the afterlife. The irony wasn’t lost on Rio.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t lost on Agatha either as she watches all of this unfold. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Slowly, almost reluctantly, Rio kneels beside the basket. Her movements are hesitant, her usual confidence tempered by something quieter, more vulnerable. She reaches out, hands trembling, and gently lifts the child from the cradle of flowers.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stood frozen, watching the scene. The woman who commanded life and death with unwavering confidence now looked… unsure. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The moment the baby rests in her arms, Rio inhales sharply, a look of wonder and fear, as though the universe itself had whispered a truth only she could understand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Out of death,” Rio whispers, her voice barely audible, “life.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s heart twisted painfully. The way she cradled the infant, her touch so tender and careful. This was a side of Rio Agatha hadn’t allowed herself to imagine, let alone witness. Agatha had made sure of that when she banished Rio from her and Nicky’s life. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s whisper hung in the air, faint but heavy with meaning. Agatha’s stomach churned. She wanted to look away, but she couldn’t. Her mind was a whirlwind of emotions she couldn’t untangle. Shock, bitterness, confusion, and jealousy. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><em> <span class="s2">Why is she so gentle now? </span> </em> <span class="s1">The thought stabbed at her. </span> <em> <span class="s2">Where was this tenderness when me and Nicky needed it?</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The memory shifted slightly, the light around the scene dimming as Rio adjusted the child in her arms. Agatha’s eyes lingered on Rio’s face, searching for answers in the her tear streaked cheeks and haunted eyes. </span> <span class="s2"><em>She knows</em>,</span> <span class="s1"> Agatha thought. </span> <em> <span class="s2">She knows exactly what this means.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A wave of anger surged within her. How dare Rio act like she could give life? After all the destruction she’d wrought, after taking Nicky, after taking </span> <span class="s2">everything</span> <span class="s1">…</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But the anger didn’t stay. It dissolved too quickly, leaving behind a heavy ache she didn’t want to name. Agatha clenched her fists, her nails digging nto her palms as she forced herself to keep watching.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shifted the child slightly in her arms, her expression hardening as if steeling herself. Slowly, she let her face change. Rio’s heartbroken beauty replaced by the haunting face of Death. Her hollow eyes seemed to darken, her features skeletal, a grim reflection of the being she truly was.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio held the child out slightly, almost as if to push her away. It was a silent question, a desperate plea: <em>This is the mother you chose?</em></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s2">”</span>I’m a monster,” Rio whispered, her voice breaking as she cradled the infant tightly against her chest once more.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The infant giggled, its tiny hand reaching up for Death’s face. Agatha’s throat tightened as she watched Rio lean closer, her expression softening in a way that felt unbearable. This wasn’t the Rio she knew. This was something else entirely.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And it hurt far more than Agatha expected.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s heart broke for Rio. For the first time, she saw it clearly. The weight Rio carried, the doubt etched into every movement. Agatha had made her feel this way, hadn’t she? Like she wasn’t worthy of being a mother, like all she ever did was take.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s face shifted back to its usual form, her features softening into something painfully human. She exhaled, a sound that started as a laugh but broke halfway through. A laugh so raw, so full of grief, that Agatha thought it might be the most heartbreaking thing she’d ever heard from the original green witch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Agatha could process it, Rio flicked her wrist. The green void around them rippled, as though the air itself had been stirred. Then, like ink spreading through water, the darkness dissolved, giving way to something entirely new.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Fields of vibrant green stretched endlessly in every direction, dotted with wildflowers that danced in the breeze. Towering forests framed the open land, their leaves shimmering like emeralds under the sun. Suddenly, they found themselves standing on a porch, its wood sturdy. A swinging bench hung beside the door, swaying faintly. The house before them was quaint, warm, and radiated a quiet, inviting charm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The sky above them shifted from its oppressive green hue to a soft, endless blue, dotted with white clouds. The entire space transformed into something breathtakingly alive, a perfect sanctuary. It looked like the kind of place where life could truly thrive, a place made for laughter, growth, and safety.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s breath hitched. She recognized it immediately. This was the dream Rio had once shared with her, a vision of the life they had planned for Nicholas before everything fell apart.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her chest ached as the memory surfaced unbidden: Rio’s voice, full of hope, describing the lush green fields, the forests where their son would play, and the home they would build together. But that dream had shattered long ago. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And yet, here it was, brought to life. Not for her and their son, but for this child cradled in Rio’s arms.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Their daughter. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha watched as Rio stood, the child cradled securely in her arms, and walked through the open door. The wood creaked faintly under her steps, disappearing into the warm glow beyond. The door remained ajar, swinging gently as if beckoning Agatha to follow.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha followed them without hesitation, her feet carrying her across the threshold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The house was nearly identical to how it had been when Sage first brought her into Rio’s realm. The same familiar layout. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But the decor and furniture told a different story. It felt rooted in another time. It was unmistakable, everything matched the style of the 1750s. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha knew there would be time later. Time to be angry, to grieve, to feel the desperate ache that was already threatening to consume her. But not now. Not here. Right now, all she wanted was to watch. To witness the life Rio had built with their child.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her emotions could wait. For now, she would let herself watch. Later, she could break.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha caught a glimpse of Rio passing the stairs, her steps purposeful as she disappeared into a hallway ahead. Without hesitation, Agatha followed, her curiosity outweighing her reservations. She watched as Rio turned left into what she presumed to be a bedroom.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2">Rio’s bedroom.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s bedroom was sparse, but every detail carried meaning. The bed was modest, accompanied by a single nightstand. Across from it stood a crib, painted a deep forest green, its craftsmanship meticulous. Agatha’s chest tightened at the sight. It was an odd, tender addition for someone who didn’t need sleep or children, yet it felt profoundly right in this space.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Though Rio didn’t need sleep, she had always loved naps, a way of grounding herself after the grueling demands of her duties. Agatha vividly recalled those days. Rio returning to her, cheeks hollow, eyes heavy and dark with exhaustion. She’d collapse onto Agatha’s bed, curling into the sheets, and when she woke, some of that weight would have lifted. It was one of the rare times Agatha could see Rio at peace, unburdened by her role as Death.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But what truly held Agatha’s attention now was the drawing resting in a picture frame on the nightstand. Agatha moved towards it. It was a memory rendered in exquisite detail. Agatha and Nicky. The scene was unmistakable: the two of them walking a winding road, Nicky laughing as he held the leash of a stubborn goat. The happiness on their faces was unmissable, their bond glowing through the delicate details. Agatha’s breath caught.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She remembered that day with startling clarity. She’d felt Rio watching from a distance, her presence brushing against Agatha’s senses. She’d ignored it, unwilling to let Rio’s shadow darken a perfect moment with her son. Time with Nicky had always felt borrowed, fleeting.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha traced the edges of the drawing with her eyes, marveling at its beauty and detail. Drawing had always been one of Rio’s secret talents. Agatha used to spend hours watching her sketch, entranced by the grace of her movements and the life she could breathe into lines on a page.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This piece was no different. It was as if Rio had poured her longing, her love, her sorrow, into every line. Agatha couldn’t look away, her heart caught in a mix of ache and wonder. Even after everything, Rio still held their past close.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt the sting of tears at the corners of her eyes, threatening to spill over. She clenched her fists, willing the emotions back down, burying the flood of memories and the ache rising in her chest. She forced herself to tear her gaze from the drawing, turning her attention to Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio stood by the crib, her movements soft as she gently placed the child inside. The cosmic being looked entirely human, delicate and vulnerable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s voice was quiet, laced with affection. “Your mother isn’t very happy with me right now, Petal,” she murmured, brushing a stray curl from the child’s face. “But we’ll give her time, yes? Even now, I see her woven into every part of you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words struck Agatha like a blow. She wanted to retort, to deny the truth in Rio’s voice, but her throat tightened, silencing her. Instead, she watched, feeling as though she were intruding on a moment far too intimate for her presence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio lingered by the crib, her fingers brushing the edge as if anchoring herself. Agatha felt her resolve waver, but she forced herself to watch, the weight of everything pressing down on her, crushing her soul. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio stood silently, her gaze fixed on their child, an unreadable expression softening her features. Agatha could feel the faint hum of Rio’s thoughts.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Salvia officinalis,” Rio murmured, her voice low, “When it blooms, it gets these little flowers, soft purples and lavenders, standing out against all that green. Like a splash of color where you least expect it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha almost laughed, biting back a grin. Of course Rio was explaining plants to a baby. An infant who couldn’t tell her toes from her fingers, let alone a sage bush from a weed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio leaned against the crib, brushing a gentle hand over the child’s cheek. “Its common name is Sage,” she said softly. “People use it to cleanse, to heal… to save. A mix of green and purple, here with a purpose. To heal.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her voice was thick with emotion, and for a moment, Agatha’s smile faltered. The way Rio said it, it wasn’t just a plant or a name. It was a wish.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">A quiet, desperate wish that their daughter might heal what they couldn’t. That Agatha wouldn’t remain shackled by a grief so consuming it left her hollow, and that Rio wouldn’t drown in the anger and guilt of a life spent without knowing their son.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was a wish for something better, for a chance to mend what had been broken between them. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The infant let out an excited squeal, a sound so bright and pure it shattered the heavy silence. Agatha’s gaze flicked to Rio, catching the way her brows shot up in surprise before a sweet, genuine smile tugged at her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh, you like that, do you?” Rio cooed, leaning closer to the crib, her voice soft with affection. “Sage it is, then. If your mother doesn’t like it, I’ll just tell her you gave me no choice as it makes you so happy, after all.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage stirred in her crib, her tiny body shifting before settling again, her eyelids growing heavy. Rio leaned down, her lips brushing the baby’s forehead in a tender kiss. “I’ll let you sleep, Petal,” she murmured softly, her voice carrying a warmth that made Agatha’s chest ache. Without another word, Rio straightened and left the room, her steps light and quiet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The door clicked shut, and the room fell silent once more. Agatha hesitated, then moved forward, standing where Rio had been moments before. She looked down at the baby and reached out with trembling fingers. Her hand paused halfway, the weight of the moment pressing down on her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1"> What if this is taken from me</span> <span class="s1"> too?</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her breath hitched as she forced herself to continue, her fingers brushing through Sage’s soft brown hair. A gasp slipped past her lips. Tears welled in her eyes, spilling over before she could stop them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She leaned forward, scooping Sage into her arms with a care that felt almost fragile. The baby stirred, her tiny body adjusting, but she didn’t wake. Agatha cradled her close, feeling the gentle rise and fall of her breath.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Slowly, Agatha moved to Rio’s bed, sitting at its edge before sliding to the floor, her back resting against the frame. She held Sage against her chest, her head dipping forward as a quiet sob escaped her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Years of running, years of hiding from her grief, her guilt, and from Rio. <em>For what?</em> She had missed so much. The life of her daughter that had unfolded in her absence. And now, here she was, holding a child she had no claim to, no right to.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Resentment clawed at her insides. Sage was here, alive and thriving, while Nicky was gone. Dead. Stolen from her. Almost three hundred years of Sage’s life gone, just like the years Nicky never had. Agatha could feel the anger rising, white hot. She hated it. She hated Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But even as the anger burned, something else lingered beneath it. Love. Love for Sage, for Nicky, and even for Rio. How could she hate the woman who had given them two strong, resilient children? Two pieces of them that defied everything to exist.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It tore at her, leaving her raw and exhausted. Agatha tightened her hold on Sage, pressing a kiss to her small forehead as another sob wracked her body. For the first time in centuries, she didn’t have the strength to run. She could only sit here, tears falling freely, holding on to this fragile, fleeting moment for as long as it would let her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The door creaked open, the soft sound cutting through the stillness like a signal that her time had run out. Agatha froze for a moment, her arms tightening around Sage instinctively. But reality came crashing back. This wasn’t permanent. None of it was.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With a begrudging sigh, she carefully rose to her feet, her movements deliberate to avoid waking the baby. She stepped to the crib, reluctantly lowering Sage back into her crib. The baby stirred, letting out a faint sigh before settling again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha lingered for a heartbeat longer, her hands hovering over the crib as if she might reach down and take Sage back again. Instead, she placed her palms on her hips, grounding herself, before swiping the back of her hand across her damp cheeks. The tears were gone, but their weight still clung to her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She took a deep, steadying breath, squaring her shoulders. It was time to move on. The past wasn’t going to wait for her to catch up. With a final glance to Sage, Agatha turned and walked through the open door, bracing herself for whatever memory awaited her next.</span>

<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Okay, Petal, time to let your mother know you exist,” Rio murmured to the child wrapped snugly against her chest. Sage responded with a burst of squeals and delighted giggles, her tiny hands batting at the fabric of Rio’s dress.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Alright, alright, I hear you loud and clear,” Rio chuckled, adjusting the wrap with care before stepping out onto the porch. She descended the steps, following a worn path that cut through the yard.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha, standing off to the side, froze. They were going to find her? She crossed her arms, biting the inside of her cheek. Obviously, whatever this plan was, it hadn’t worked. 268 years later, she was only now learning about her daughter’s existence. But still… curiosity gnawed at her.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><br/><br/><em>How close had they come?</em> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">As they walked down the path, Rio glanced down at the baby nestled against her chest, her voice light but carrying an edge of nervousness. “Now, listen here, Petal. Your mother is still very, </span> <span class="s2">very</span> <span class="s1"> angry with me, so you might hear some yelling. Don’t be alarmed.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage gurgled softly, her tiny hands clutching at the fabric of Rio’s dress.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio sighed, a wry smile tugging at her lips. “Hopefully, when she sees the very cute baby attached to me, we’ll avoid any… physical violence. But just in case, you’re my shield, alright? Be adorable. That’s your job.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The baby let out a squeal as if in agreement, and Rio chuckled softly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha scoffed at Rio’s comment and trailed after them, keeping a cautious distance. The heels she wore pinched with every step, and with an annoyed huff, she bent down and slipped them off. Barefoot now, she padded silently along the path, her eyes fixed on Rio and Sage as they move ahead.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio came to a stop. Agatha watched as she reached to her hip, pulling her blade that had been hidden beneath the fabric of her dress. Rio muttered something under her breath, and with a sharp, deliberate motion, she sliced through the air. A glowing portal coming to life. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitated for only a moment before following. She wasn’t about to let Rio vanish without knowing what had happened all those years ago.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They stepped through and Agatha found herself surrounded by towering trees and dense greenery. The air smelled fresh, tinged with the earthy scent of moss and damp wood.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">A forest. It felt vaguely familiar, though Agatha couldn’t quite place it. Then again, she’d been in plenty of forests before. They all blurred together in her memory. Places where she’d lured witches under false pretenses, stripping them of their power.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sage!” Rio’s voice rang out, cutting through the serene quiet of the forest. She spun around, her eyes wide and wild as she clawed at the empty wrap tied around her chest, her hands trembling with desperation. “Sage!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze, her heart lurching at the terror in Rio’s voice. In all the centuries she’d known her, she had never seen Rio look like this. Completely unmoored, stripped of her usual composure.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t waste a second. She turned and bolted back toward the portal, her flowing dress tangling around her legs as she stumbled but didn’t stop. Agatha snapped into motion, chasing after her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha dove through the portal just as it<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>shut behind her, cutting off the forest and plunging them back into Rio’s realm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As they reached the porch, Rio froze, halting abruptly. There, in the same basket she had arrived in the day the universe birthed her, Sage sat, cooing softly, oblivious to the chaos her disappearance had caused. Relief crashed over Rio, and she let out a shaky breath, her hands gripping the porch railing for support.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stumbled up behind her, out of breath. Her heart pounded wildly, her chest heaving as she bent over, hands braced on her knees. For<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>a split second, she thought she might throw up.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s attention was fixed solely on Sage. With cautious steps, she moved toward the basket, dropping to her knees in front of it. “Oh, Petal,” she whispered, her voice trembling. She reached out, brushing her fingers gently over Sage’s soft cheek, her shoulders sagging with relief.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha straightened slowly, still catching her breath. She swallowed hard, her pulse beginning to settle as she watched Rio with the child. The scene before her, the raw emotion on Rio’s face, the way she cradled Sage with such care, stirred something deep in Agatha’s chest. But she pushed it down, focusing instead on the sharp pain in her legs. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Next time,” Agatha muttered to no one, her voice hoarse, “try keeping better track of your kid.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Well, it looks like you won’t be meeting your mother today,” Rio murmured softly, She pressed a kiss to the baby’s forehead, her expression calm once more. “But don’t fret, Petal. I’ll figure it out soon.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With that, Rio carried Sage inside, the door clicking shut behind her, leaving Agatha standing alone on the porch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she’d been holding. The tension in her body didn’t ease, though. Instead, it only twisted tighter as she processed what had just happened. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then the sound of squeals and giggles reached her ears, bright and infectious. She whipped around, her eyes darting toward the source. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Another memory.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stepped off the porch, her bare feet sinking into the soft grass as she moved closer, needing a better view of what was unfolding.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There sat Rio, her hair loose and flowing, with the gentle breeze. She wore a white linen shirt and simple brown pants, her feet bare against the earth. Beside her lay a sketchbook and pencil, but whatever Rio had been working on didn’t matter. Agatha’s attention was completely captured by the scene in front of her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was on her knees, her arms outstretched, her face lit with encouragement. “Come on, Petal, you’ve got it,” she called, her voice soft yet excited.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze shifted to Sage, who was standing a few feet away from Rio. She looked older now, perhaps a year, her tiny hands reached out in front of her for balance.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha gasps. Sage was about to take her first steps.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then she noticed the child’s outfit, a rough, woven brown fabric that could only be described as a sack. Agatha had to bite her lip to stifle a laugh. Of course, Rio had no idea how to dress a baby. She probably thought functionality trumped all else.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Still, Sage stood tall, wobbling slightly, before lifting one foot and placing it forward. Then another. And another. Three unsteady, heavy steps carried her straight into Rio’s waiting arms.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s laugh erupted, full of unrestrained joy, the kind that echoed through the air and made the world feel lighter. It was breathtaking. Agatha’s chest tightened, her heart swelling with so much love in that moment that she didn’t even try to guilt herself for feeling it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage squealed with delight, giggling as Rio lifted her into the air, holding her high above her head in celebration. When Rio brought her back down, she pressed their foreheads together, her laugh still bubbling.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then Sage reached out, her tiny fingers grabbing hold of Rio’s cheeks. “Ma-ma,” Sage babbled, her little voice triumphant. “Ma-ma!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze, the sound piercing straight through her. She watched as Rio’s expression softened further, her eyes shimmering with a love so profound it seemed to envelop the moment. Her smile was impossibly wide, so full of pure, unfiltered happiness that it felt eternal, stretching across eons.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t move, couldn’t think. Her entire world narrowed to this memory, this perfect snapshot of a love that had somehow survived everything. It was overwhelming, beautiful, and devastating all at once.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The front door of the house swung open with a bang, the sound loud enough to make Agatha’s head whip around. She turned back toward the memory she had just witnessed, but it was gone. It vanished as if it had never been there. The air shifted, darkening, as storm clouds rolled in overhead, the distant rumble of thunder echoing in her ears.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then she heard it.. cries, sharp and desperate, cutting through the silence. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1">Sage.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without thinking, Agatha ran, her bare feet pounding against the ground as the rain began to fall. She reached the house just as the downpour started, slipping inside and following the sound of Sage’s cries. It led her to Rio’s room.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The door was closed, but that didn’t stop her. Agatha walked straight through it, the scene on the other side hitting her like a wave.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The room was filled with an oppressive amount of steam, so thick it blurred her vision. She winced as the heat pressed against her face, making her skin prickle, but she pushed forward. The air smelled faintly of herbs, earthy, likely a green witch’s healing magic.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">In the corner of the room, a wooden tub sat filled with boiling water, the source of the steam. Rio stood beside it, Sage cradled tightly against her chest. The baby’s screams had softened into weak, pitiful whines, her little body shaking with hard, wracking coughs.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio swayed on her feet, her hand rubbing soothing circles on Sage’s back. “Shhhh, Petal,” she murmured, her voice soft but strained. “It’s no fun being sick, is it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage nuzzled further into her neck, her tiny fingers clutching at the fabric of Rio’s shirt as another cough shook her small frame. Rio’s expression cracked, and Agatha watched as silent tears slid down her cheeks, her shoulders trembling with the effort to keep herself composed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“It’s times like this,” Rio whispered, her voice breaking, “that I wish your mother was here.” She glanced down at Sage, brushing a hand over her damp brown curls. “Im a green witch, and I never thought something as simple as a cold would be the thing that left me feeling so damn helpless.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. She stood frozen in the doorway, the vulnerability in Rio’s words cutting through her. This was Rio as a mother, scared and desperate, doing everything she could for her child. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She needed Agatha there and she wasn’t, not when Rio and their child needed her the most.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was unbearable to watch. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was as if the universe had heard Agatha’s thoughts. The door slammed shut in Agatha’s face, and this time, an unseen force physically pulled her into the next memory.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The scene shifted abruptly, and Agatha found herself standing atop a familiar hill. Her chest constricted as recognition washed over her like ice water. Her heart shattered into a million jagged pieces, knowing all too well what was about to unfold.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There was Rio, standing amidst the tall grass with Sage toddling nearby, the babbling one-year-old wobbling unsteadily but determined. Rio watched her closely, her presence calm but alert, ready to catch her if she fell.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as her eyes trailed to Rio’s outfit. The white linen shirt and brown pants were gone, replaced by the same outfit, black cloak and crown, she had worn the day Agatha kissed her for what she thought would be the last time. The day she had surrendered herself to Death. The sight was a dagger to her already fragile heart.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As if answering the question Agatha couldn’t voice, Rio’s voice floated over the breeze, soft and patient. “Astral projection, Petal. I promise I’ll teach it to you when you’re older.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Agatha could react, Rio’s gaze shifted, her expression tightening as she caught sight of something. Agatha followed her line of sight and froze.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio wasn’t looking at her directly, but at her back—at the Agatha of the past. Sage squealed with delight and wobbled after the figure, her small hands outstretched toward the dark cloak that dragged across the ground.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Sage could make contact, Rio swept her into her arms, her movements swift. Sage let out a scream of frustration, writhing in Rio’s hold as the storm clouds began to gather, the air growing heavy with tension.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha’s heart thundered as her past self turned, revealing the book clutched tightly in her hands, the </span> <span class="s2">Darkhold</span> <span class="s1">. The edges of her fingers were blackened, the corruption already creeping up her skin.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The storm unleashed itself. Wind howled and lightning split the sky as Sage’s cries became distant. In the blink of an eye, the child was gone, her screams snuffed out as though they’d never existed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Yet Rio remained. She stepped forward, her form flickering between the astral and physical planes, until she became fully visible to the Agatha of the past.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha, the Agatha of now, couldn’t bear it. This was the last time she had seen Rio before she vanished for two centuries. The agony of that moment, of that memory, was too much. She wanted to look away, to shield herself from the heartbreak she already knew was coming. But, of course, she couldn’t.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The universe wasn’t finished with her yet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Agatha, no! Please, don’t do this!” Rio’s voice cracked as she called out, her hand outstretched toward the woman she once called her wife.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha turned around slowly, a devilish smile curling at her lips. Her expression was cruel, and it made Rio’s chest ache.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Please my love,” Rio begged, her voice<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>desperate. She held out a folded piece of paper, her hand trembling slightly. “Before you do anything stupid just…. take this.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a moment, there was a flicker of hesitation in Agatha’s eyes. She stepped closer and reached out, her black tipped fingers brushing the paper in Rio’s hand. But as soon as she took it, the cruel smirk returned.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“See ya never, toots,” Agatha said coldly. Then, in an instant, she vanished, leaving only the faint echo of her magic in the air. The paper flew from her grasp, carried off by the wind.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The memory shifted. Rio was gone now, leaving only Agatha standing alone in the void of the past. The paper, tossed and battered by the wind, fluttered down in front of her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stared at it for a moment, the world silent except for the storm raging in her chest. She bent down, trembling hands picking it up, and unfolds it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her breath hitched.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was a drawing of Sage, sitting in the grass on the day she took her first steps, dressed in that ridiculous woven sack Rio had deemed acceptable. The details were immaculate. The delicate curve of Sage’s tiny hands, the determined smile on her face, the way the sunlight seemed to kiss her brown hair.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha collapses, her knees hitting the ground hard, the drawing still clutched in her hands. Her scream tore through the silence, raw and guttural, echoing with all the pain she had buried for centuries. It was the sound of grief, regret, and self-loathing wrapped into one harrowing cry.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She sobbed uncontrollably, her tears blurring the lines of the drawing as the realization hit her with the force of a death by a thousand cuts. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Why had she been such a </span> <span class="s2">fucking idiot</span> <span class="s1">? Why had she let her anger, her pride, her fear drive her to this? She had given up so much trying to run from her past that she had unknowingly sacrificed an entire future. A future with a child she never even knew existed.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And it was all her fault.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her chest heaved as she curled over the drawing, clutching it to her heart like it was the only thing holding her together. For the first time in centuries, she let herself break completely.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt the pull as Sage’s memories began slipping away from her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No! Please, I want more time!” she cried, her voice breaking as she begged into the void. “I want more time!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But no one answered, and then, in a blink, she was back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The familiar surroundings of Rio’s house came into focus, but her breath caught when she realized who was right in front of her. It wasn’t Sage. It wasn’t Death, cloaked and untouchable, but Rio. Just Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She wore the same black hoodie and grey shorts she’d had on before slamming the door in Agatha’s face, except now her face was smudged with dirt, as though she’d been working in a garden. Agatha’s hands were still raised, frozen in the position they’d been in when she had held Sage’s head. Only now, Rio stood in Sage’s place, inches away, her expression hesitant, scared even, like she was bracing for Agatha to lash out after learning the truth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze shifted, catching sight of Sage slumped on the floor nearby, groaning softly. Rio had been the one to rip her from Agatha’s grasp, pulling her back to the present.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Agatha didn’t scream. She didn’t yell. She didn’t fight. Her chest rose and fell with the weight of her emotions, and for a long, quiet moment, she simply stared at Rio, her eyes scanning every detail of her face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, with a steadiness that surprised even herself, she reached out and cupped Rio’s face in her hands.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“My love,” Agatha whispered, her voice trembling, filled with everything she couldn’t put into words… pain, regret, relief. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s breath caught, her wide eyes searching Agatha’s, unsure of what to say, what to do. But Agatha didn’t let go, her touch grounding them both as the weight of centuries hung between them like a fragile thread.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha doesn’t know how long she’s been standing like this, staring at Rio. Her face is cradled in Agatha’s hands, and Rio’s fingers rest gently around her wrists, like she’s afraid to hold on too tightly. Their touch is the only thing grounding them, the only thing keeping the silence from breaking apart.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For the first time in a very long time, the world isn’t spinning out of control. She’s afraid to move, terrified that if she lets go, Rio will disappear like smoke, and this fragile moment will collapse.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before everything fell apart, Rio had a way of settling the fire in her chest, calming the chaos, even if only for a fleeting moment. But that was a lifetime ago. Somewhere along the line, Rio stopped putting out the fire and started fueling it. She became the spark that lit Agatha’s anger, the gasoline that kept her grief and guilt burning, and it turned into an unrelenting inferno she couldn’t escape.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And yet, here she is now, Rio’s face in her hands, her dark brown eyes gazing back at her. The fire isn’t roaring. It’s quiet. The silence scares the hell out of Agatha, digs into her chest in ways she isn’t ready to admit.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swallows, her thoughts racing. Every instinct screams at her to let go, to run, to ruin this before it ruins her. She’s never been good at holding on to what matters; she always leaves before she can be left. But before Agatha can pull away, before she can be the one to fuck it all up, Rio falters.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It’s subtle… a shift in her gaze, a flicker of hesitation. Rio clears her throat and gently steps back, breaking their fragile connection. Rio’s hands fall away, her warmth retreating. Agatha stands frozen, her arms dropping to her sides, her chest aching.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There’s no fire. It’s still quiet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The silence doesn’t feel like peace anymore. It feels like absence. The feeling rips through her, hollowing her out as Rio steps further away, her expression unreadable. Agatha wants to call her back, to say something, anything, to make her stay. But the words won’t come.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She watches Rio turn away, and the space between them feels infinite. And in that moment, the truth becomes undeniable, sinking into her like a weight she can’t ignore.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio isn’t gasoline anymore. She isn’t fire. She’s the air Agatha can’t breathe without, and it’s killing her to let Rio go.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Rio, I- ” Agatha starts, her voice trembling, but Rio cuts her off with a heavy sigh.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Go to bed, Petal,” Rio murmurs softly, the words weighted with exhaustion.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha registers that it’s dark outside now, the night pressing against the windows like a silent observer. But her sole focus is on Rio, who seems to be retreating from her, even though she stands only a few steps away. Agatha could reach out, could touch her if she dared, but the space between them feels vast, an unspoken gap she isn’t sure how to cross.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“But I’m not tired,” Sage interjects suddenly from her spot on the floor, her voice breaking the tension. She rushes the words out before Rio can stop her. To be honest, Agatha had forgotten Sage was even there.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sage,” Rio snaps, her voice sharper than intended, then immediately softens, drawing back. “Please,” she whispers, the quiet plea heavy with unspoken emotions.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage hesitates, her eyes flicking between the two of them, but finally listens. With visible reluctance, she rises and heads upstairs to her room, casting one last uncertain glance over her shoulder before disappears up the staircase.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The silence left in her wake is deafening, the air thick with everything unsaid. Agatha shifts on her feet, searching for something to ground herself, but all she finds is Rio, still there, yet impossibly far away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“So, was the potato sack a fashion statement or a sign of questionable parenting skills?” Agatha quips, arching a brow as she tries to break the tension.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s shoulders sag, and she releases a frustrated huff, shaking her head. “Do you ever get tired of turning everything into a fucking joke?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s eyes widen, and she straightens her shoulders, caught off guard by Rio’s sudden outburst. The words sting more than she’d like to admit, but she doesn’t respond, doesn’t trust herself to say the right thing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio sighs softly. “Goodnight, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha watches her leave, the weight of the silence settling around her like a heavy cloak. She lets out a frustrated breath of her own, muttering as she changes out of the suit Sage had chosen for her to wear. She pulls on the pajamas that had mysteriously appeared after Rio left, along with a pillow and blanket waiting neatly on the couch. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Of course, Rio would do that.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Neither of us even need sleep,” she grumbles to herself, bitterness threading through her voice. “You know…..Death and a ghost in physical form.” She punches her fist into the overly puffy pillow, trying<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to make it comfortable. The effort feels pointless, her mind far too restless to entertain the idea of actually closing her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">-</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Blinking away the remnants of restless sleep, Agatha’s eyes land on the coffee table in front of her. A new outfit sits folded neatly: jeans, an oversized woven sweater, and even a bra and underwear.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She stares at it for a long moment, her gaze lingering on the folded fabric. The jeans and sweater are one thing, but the matching lacy black bra and underwear? That’s deliberate. That’s Rio. Agatha’s fingers twitch at her sides, her breath uneven as a hundred images flash through her mind. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio picking them out, her hands brushing over the delicate lace, the faint smirk that would tug at her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It feels like an unspoken challenge wrapped in soft fabric. Agatha had spent centuries wielding power, bending the world to her will. But now? Now she has none. Now she’s the one being played, the one being tested.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her chest tightens as her eyes drift back to the bra, its subtle elegance daring her. It’s not just clothing, it’s Rio’s voice in her head, low and teasing: </span> <em> <span class="s2">Go on, Agatha. Prove it. Give up your control. Give it to me, for me. </span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The thought sends a heat rippling through her body. A desperate ache settles between her legs, her thighs pressing together instinctively. Her hands curl into fists, holding on to her control, though it feels pointless now. She bites her lip, trying to ground herself for only a moment before she whispers, “Fuck it,” and rips the clothes from the coffee table and begins to change out of her pajamas. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then the sound of angry whispers coming from the kitchen rip from her thoughts.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She hurries to get herself dressed before anyone can walk in on her (she really should’ve asked where the bathroom is in this place). She could go find it if she really wanted to or even slip into Rio’s room, but she has other priorities.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Eavesdropping.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><em> <span class="s2">Okay, so maybe I’m nosey,</span> </em> <span class="s1"> she thinks, pulling the sweater over her head as she listens closely to the heated exchange coming from the kitchen.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No! You’re not leaving,” Sage hisses in a sharp whisper.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I have a job. Duties I have to take care of,” Rio replies, her voice low but steady.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Have your minions do it,” Sage snaps back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio sighs, the kind of heavy, frustrated exhale that practically radiates exhaustion.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smirks faintly to herself. She can already picture the scene: Rio calm but unyielding, Sage fuming.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Outside, thunder rumbles, low and sharp, as if echoing Sage’s rising anger.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">So, Rio’s trying to leave.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha rolls her eyes. The minions Sage refers to are what Rio dramatically calls the </span> <span class="s2">“Guardians of the Cycle.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The whole system is made up of Collectors, Sentinels, Weavers, whatever Rio’s calls them now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Agatha’s heard it all before. Rio delegates most of her duties to this network of beings, letting them manage the mundane tasks of the cycle of life and death. Lady Death only steps in when something significant happens or when she feels like it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And clearly, today was one of those days.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You promised! You promised me that if I asked you to stay, you would. And I hardly ever did. So I’m asking you now.” A pause, “Please, Mom.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s voice cracked on the last word, and Agatha’s breath caught. Her heart twisted painfully at the sound of it, that single word burrowing deeper than she expected.</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br/></span> <span class="s2"><em>Mom</em>.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha shut it down, forcing herself not to linger on it. She couldn’t afford to think about that right now.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Fine!” Rio’s voice rang sharp and frustrated through the house, followed by something… strange. A harsh guttural bark that made Agatha freeze mid motion. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Did she just… bark? At their daughter?</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha scoffs, shaking her head at even asking herself that question. Of course Rio would bark at someone. Barking at someone is exactly the kind of thing Rio would do. It’s absurd, but it’s so her that Agatha can’t help the faint smirk tugging at her lips. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Agatha could process it, footsteps approached, quick, stopping abruptly with a sharp squeak of shoes against the floor.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha cursed under her breath, fumbling with the jeans she was trying to pull on. She was still in just the bra and underwear, </span>the ones Rio had picked out for her, when she looked up and froze.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio stood in the foyer, framed by the dim light filtering in from the kitchen, her presence unrelenting. Her eyes immediately locked onto Agatha, and for a moment, neither of them moved.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then Rio made a point of letting her gaze travel, slow and deliberate, taking in every inch of Agatha standing there half dressed. From the curve of her shoulders to the lace of her bra, her eyes lingered just long enough to make Agatha’s skin flush before dragging up to meet hers again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stands straight, squaring her shoulders.</span>
</p><p class="p1"><em><br/><br/>Challenge accepted</em>.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, with a dramatic pout, Agatha quips, “A promise is a promise, my love.” She has to tease her. How could she not? Look at her, powerless and begging for Rio’s attention, her words drenched in an ache she won’t admit out loud. Agatha hated how much she needed this, how much she needed </span> <span class="s2">her</span> <span class="s1">. Just one glance, one word, one moment where Rio acknowledged her, and Agatha would give anything.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio snarls, her expression twisting in irritation as she rolls her eyes. “There’s a bathroom down the hall,” then simply turns and walks away. The sound of the back door slamming reverberates through the house. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha lets out a shaky breath, as she grabs the sweater, shoving it on roughly as if the fabric itself were to blame for the knot in her chest. She pauses for a moment, staring at the space Rio just vacated, and then she moves.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She follows Rio, each step purposeful, though she doesn’t quite know what she’ll say or if she’ll have the strength to say anything at all.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When she steps outside into the backyard, she’s met with a scene so startling it makes her trip over her own feet. The sheer expanse of it steals the air from her lungs.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">It’s breathtaking.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The garden stretches endlessly before her, wild and vibrant yet meticulously cared for, as if every blade of grass, every flower, has been touched by Rio’s hand. A cobblestone path winds through it all, disappearing into the soft shadows cast by towering trees and vine covered arches. At the heart of it, a pond, its surface dotted with lily pads and koi fish that move in the water.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Everything about it feels alive, brimming with a quiet magic that hums in the air. It’s not just beautiful, it’s purposeful. The kind of place that could only be built with patience and care. Agatha grips the doorframe for balance, her heart racing as she takes it all in.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And yet, for all its beauty, it feels so deeply personal. It’s an extension of Rio herself. It’s almost too much to process, the overwhelming sense of peace stretching in every corner. Agatha exhales shakily, swallowing hard, pushing to move forward as the weight of it all presses against her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><em> <span class="s2">It’s all very dramatic, </span></em> <span class="s1">Agatha thinks. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The patio is simple, paved with smooth stone that extends seamlessly into the garden just a few steps away. There’s nothing obstructing her view. Every flower, every tree, and the still pond are perfectly visible, almost within reach. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha settles into a patio swing, with a circular intricate metal frame</span> <span class="s1">. The design is delicate yet sturdy, with floral patterns carved into the metal, forming an elegant circle as its frame, vines flowing through it like the garden itself had inspired its creation. The swing rocks gently as she leans back, the soft creak of the chains blending with the quiet sounds of the garden.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The swing sits at the perfect spot, close enough to feel like she’s a part of the space but just far enough to keep from intruding. Still, as her eyes follow Rio’s movements, she can’t shake the feeling that she’s teetering on the edge of something deeply personal, sacred. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s crouched near the pond, pulling overgrown weeds from the stones that lined it with steady hands.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio straightens after a moment, wiping her dirt covered hands on her white tank top. She’s wearing worn blue jeans, frayed at the cuffs, a baby blue baseball cap pulled low over her dark hair, and scuffed black converse, the soles covered with dirt.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She adjusts the brim of her cap and moves to the vegetable patch, pulling a ripe squash free with a smooth tug before stepping toward one of the arches where a basket filled with other vegetables sit. Her movements are calm, purposeful, as if every action is second nature.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could watch her do this forever. And for four straight days, she does. It becomes a routine, one that feels impossibly intimate despite the silence between them. Agatha wakes just before sunrise, early enough for Sage to still be fast asleep. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Each morning she finds a fresh sets of clothes folded neatly on the coffee table for her, along with a new pair of a matching bra and underwear set. </span> <span class="s2">Always perfectly chosen. </span> <span class="s1">Each pair more suggestive than the last. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It’s as if Rio knows the exact moment she’s changing. Without fail, Rio would appear from the kitchen, her footsteps unhurried, her gaze lingering far longer than necessary. She wouldn’t say a word, wouldn’t even pretend to look away. Her dark, hungry eyes would sweep over Agatha, taking their time, drinking her in.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t muster a sarcastic remark or sharp jab, not with the way Rio looked at her. Instead, she stood there, head held high, letting Rio enjoy the view. She didn’t shift, didn’t break, but she felt the tension coil tighter in her chest each time. When Rio was done, when that dark intensity finally flickered and faded behind her guarded mask, she would simply turn and walk outside.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Every time Rio left, Agatha would find coffee waiting for her in the kitchen, perfectly made, just the way she liked it. It was never mentioned but the simple gesture lingered in the air, almost as heavy as the looks Rio gave her before disappearing into the garden.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">These brief but intimate moments they would share in the quiet of the morning were the only thing that would get up her up in the morning. The only thing she would look forward to. Because the moment Agatha stepped onto that patio with her coffee, the endless turning of her mind would begin to consume her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">From sunrise to sunset, Rio worked in the garden, her hands moving with quiet purpose, her focus unshakable. And Agatha would sit on the patio swing, watching. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For four days, Agatha sat, thought, and watched. She thought about everything. She thought about herself, about Rio, about the tangled mess of their relationship. It was dark and so stained, and she wasn’t sure they could survive it. The next moment she would seethe with anger and jealousy over the life Rio shared with Sage, the time Rio got to spend as a mother. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was time Agatha never had with Nicky. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then the sorrow would creep in, sharp and suffocating, as she mourned her son. She thought of the life she couldn’t give him, the protection she had failed to offer. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had taken her son. But hadn’t Agatha also robbed Rio of him? Robbed her of knowing Nicky, forcing her to watch from a distance for six years. Worse, she forced Rio and Nicky to witness as she took the lives of countless witches, desperate to grow her power, hoping to find some way to save him.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She sometimes lost herself in the search for an answer, spending precious time chasing salvation instead of making new, beautiful, memories with her son.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s fist closed around her locket instinctively, knuckles white as if the metal could anchor her. The familiar weight of it pressed into her palm, and for a fleeting moment it almost hurt. She welcomed the pain. It was better than drowning in the guilt, the shame, and the overwhelming sense of loss.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">On the second day, as Rio worked on the farthest edge of the garden, Agatha gave in to a nagging pull of a particular willow tree. It caught her eye the moment she stepped foot on to the patio, and she couldn’t shake the feeling that it demanded her attention. She approached it carefully. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">A large stone, </span>its edges softened and uneven, worn down by years of rain and wind, <span class="s1">rested beneath its drooping branches. A fresh bouquet of white lilies arranged at its base. The inscription carved into it was faded and nearly lost to time but still legible. It stole her breath:</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em><span class="s2">‘I bury my own heart<br/></span> </em>
</p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Here with you, my child</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">If one be gone, we carry on</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">But every mile I go</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">With every bend</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Beyond the end</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Your mothers love you so’</span></em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha wanted to fucking puke. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was excruciating. The heaviness of the words sent her stumbling back toward her swing. Rio’s gaze followed her, but she said nothing. She simply turned back to her tending.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then there was Sage, always Sage, relentless and full of questions, an annoying voice with brown hair too much like Agatha’s own. Did Agatha want to play a board game? Would she like to quiz Sage on random subjects so the girl could show off her endless knowledge? Or maybe Sage could ask her questions about Agatha’s past as a young witch? The girl was on her constantly, asking about everything and nothing. She acted like Agatha’s shadow.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha avoided her as best she could. She could hardly look at Sage without feeling like she might shatter under the gravity of all the memories. Sage’s memories. She convinced herself over and over that she could never be a mother to Sage. It wouldn’t be fair. She hadn’t been a mother to Nicky, not in the way that mattered.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Not in the way that kept him alive. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When the thoughts became too much and when Sage’s voice grated on her already frayed nerves, Agatha fixated on Rio. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2">Only Rio. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She didn’t let herself think too deeply. She just watched. And she was so damn grateful that Rio allowed her to see her face. Because if Rio had insisted on hiding her stupid beautiful face, only showing her the face of Death, Agatha was certain she would not have lasted the four days she did before she absolutely fucking lost it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1">But we’ll get to that later. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">On the third day, Agatha was more restless than ever, her thoughts devouring her. She didn’t have the energy to speak, though it was hard to avoid Sage. The girl had a habit of prying her open, unwilling and reluctant, she would have Agatha asking her random questions about botany, reptiles, history, and literature. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Never anything deeper, always surface level.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Sage stepped onto the patio that morning, bright eyed and smug as ever, tongue pressed into her cheek like she was certain today would be the day she broke through, Agatha didn’t even glance at her. Sage took one look at her, the smirk falling, and without a word turned right back around into the house.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Minutes later, she was back. Agatha didn’t bother looking up until Sage blocked her view, ruining what little peace her morning coffee provided. Sighing, Agatha bit the inside of her cheek and glanced up.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her jaw slackened.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Cradled in Sage’s arms, perfectly relaxed as though he belonged there, was Señor Scratchy.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a moment, Agatha didn’t move, didn’t react, stunned into stillness. Then, almost reflexively, she reached up for him only to realize she still had her coffee cup in hand. Sage adjusted the rabbit effortlessly, reached down, and plucked the mug from Agatha’s grip.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Mo- ” Sage started, but cut herself off, her face shifting. “I mean, uh, Rio took him when you… you know,” As she handed the rabbit over.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Stop.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The word slipped out, soft but broken. Agatha’s voice wavered as tears stung her eyes. She forced them not to spill over, but the weight of everything pressed against her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">How big of a bitch could she possibly be? To die, leaving behind an ex-wife who buried her with so much love and care, only for said ex-wife to rescue her familiar immediately afterward. And for what? So Agatha could return as a ghost, not because she </span> <span class="s2">had</span> <span class="s1"> to, but because she couldn’t face what came after death. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Also maybe because she never wanted the chase to end.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t say another word. She moved to the far end of the swing, curling her knees tight to her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That’s when the clouds rolled in, swallowing the sun in a matter of seconds. It wasn’t a storm. They were just thick, dark clouds hanging heavy over the sky.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It didn’t go unnoticed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio looked up from the vegetables she was picking, her hands stalling. Her eyes immediately found Sage, curled up tight, then on Agatha with Señor Scratchy in her arms. Her brow furrowed with concern, and she tilted her head back, scanning the clouds.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She lingered for just a moment before returning to her work.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For the next twenty four hours, the sky would stay that way. No rain. No thunder. Just dark gray.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha lasted a half day more before she lost it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">I need to get the fuck out of here.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She shot up from the swing, bolted through the back door, and didn’t stop until she was out the front, her breath ragged and her mind screaming for escape.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t care that she was barefoot.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She made it about two miles up the road before something latched onto her. A force so violent she couldn’t process it. Suddenly, she was airborne and being dragged back. When she hit the ground, she tumbled hard, landing near the bushes Rio was tending, just to the right of where Sage sat cross legged in the grass.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha rolled, bracing for impact, She came to an abrupt stop stomach flush with the ground, before releasing a short, frustrated groan.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before she could ask what the hell that was about, the younger brunette was already on her feet, beating her to it. “You’re tethered to the witch who gave your ghost a physical form.” Her voice was calm, as though the explanation were obvious. Then, without another word, Sage turned and walked back toward the house.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha blinked, stunned, before scrambling up to chase her. She faintly heard Rio calling her name, her voice loud and booming after her. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">You snooze, you lose.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">If Rio had done that yesterday… Spoken first, broken her strict silence, Agatha would’ve have fallen to her knees on the spot.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Hoping Rio would break was the only thing that could overshadow the chaos running rampant in her mind. It was her only escape, no matter how fleeting. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But not today. Today, she was pissed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha was </span> <span class="s2">so tired</span> <span class="s1"> of children thinking they knew better. Thinking they could run her life, thinking they were emotionally superior. They knew nothing.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">#1. Teen :<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not the burden of centuries. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">#2. Sage : Not the weight of knowing Death in every form. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She was a four hundred year old witch, for fuck’s sake. She deserved some goddamn respect.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stormed up to Sage’s room, a place she hadn’t set foot in since she first stepped out of it. She stopped short when she saw Sage standing with her back to her, staring out the window. Agatha took a deep breath, steadying herself, forcing her temper to stay in check.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Two things Agatha knew for certain.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When it comes to the looks department, Sage took so much after Agatha. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Fact.</span></em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her entire personality, the energy she carried, reeked of Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Fact.</span></em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The unwavering defiance, </span> <span class="s2">that</span> <span class="s1"> was all Rio. If Agatha lost her cool, she knew Sage would dig her heels in, just like Rio always would.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The girl was here to make her face the music. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2">Exactly like Rio. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sage,” Agatha started, her voice a whisper, “please… just let me go back. It’s too much.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage turned to face her, arms crossed, expression neutral. Her silence was unnerving.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Finally, she nodded slightly, “Okay.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze, stunned, as Sage lifted a hand and opened a portal. “Go,” she said simply.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s heart jumped into her throat. The portal hung there, revealing the record store where this all began. Just before Sage walked in and turned her world upside down.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was right there. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s thoughts scream at her:</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">What are you doing? You’re powerless here! Move!</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Go,” Sage repeated, louder this time.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha took a hesitant step forward, but she couldn’t move any further. She just stood there, frozen.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You want to leave? </span> <span class="s2">Go!</span> <span class="s1">” Sage yelled. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Outside, thunder roared, shaking the house to its foundation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha flinched. The storm outside erupted, rain pounding the roof and lightning splitting the sky. It was deafening, relentless. And still, she couldn’t take another step.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She wasn’t being held here by magic, wasn’t trapped by some spell. Sage was giving her something far worse.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Free will.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha released a guttural, frustrated noise, half scream, half sob, before turning away from the portal. She stomped out of the room, slamming the door behind her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She stormed down the stairs, past Rio’s room, out the back door to the stupid patio swing. Crossing her arms tight over her chest, she turned and slammed herself onto the metal bench so hard she was surprised it didn’t snap from its chains.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">By the time Agatha’s ass hit the bench, the sky was blue again, the sun shining obnoxiously bright.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha knew she probably looked ridiculous, like a petulant child who didn’t get her way. She didn’t care. Her narrowed eyes immediately found Rio, standing drenched head to toe, in the garden.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Of course she looked like a dream.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s soaked blue crewneck clung to her skin, her grey shorts plastered to her legs, and her white tennis shoes (easily the dirtiest shoes Agatha had ever seen) were surely ruined. Agatha barked out a quick frustrated yell, the sight of Rio only making her angrier.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was already staring at her. To the untrained eye, she looked unphased, but Agatha could see it. The slight widening of Rio’s eyes, trying to fight the faintest hint of a smirk tugging at her lips. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Even from several feet away Agatha could still fucking see it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha held her gaze, unrelenting, daring her to say something. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Hoping, even. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They stayed like that for a long moment. Then, as though nothing had happened, Rio turned back to her garden.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stared at the living room ceiling, the stillness of the house mocking the chaos inside her. Four emotionally exhausting days, and her mind still hadn’t settled. Sage had given her an out, a chance to leave and walk away from this mess.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> For the life of her, Agatha couldn’t take it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She didn’t </span> <span class="s2">want</span> <span class="s1"> to take it. As much as it hurt to be here, to face everything she’d left behind, she couldn’t bring herself to leave. Agatha blames it on the fact that she couldn’t make that choice under the weight of Sage’s unrelenting green gaze. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Not in front of her.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">If there was one thing Agatha had mastered, it was the art of detachment. It had been her survival skill, her constant shield. She did what she had to do, always, never sparing a thought for anyone’s feelings or the consequences left in her wake. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Sage complicated that. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Whether Agatha liked it or not, Sage was her daughter. Seeing Rio through Sage’s memories, seeing her as a mother, seeing her first steps, her first word. It was a weight Agatha hadn’t anticipated. That knowledge alone shackled her, leaving her unable to make a clean break while Sage stood there, watching.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">So yes, Agatha would have left. <em>Absolutely</em>. But what she </span> <span class="s2">wouldn’t</span> <span class="s1"> do was abandon Sage right in front of her face. Not like that. Never like that.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As if Sage could hear the wheels turning in Agatha’s mind, a portal opened in the middle of the room. It shimmered faintly, the same portal Sage had shown her earlier that day, the one that led to the record store. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha scrambled to her feet, her sweatshirt rumpled and plaid pajama pants slightly twisted with the suddenness of her movements. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage was giving her another out. A chance to leave in the dead of night. No prying eyes, no distractions, nothing holding her back. It was a clean break. An escape.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s feet carried her toward the portal almost on instinct, her body moving before her mind had caught up. She stopped just short of it, the light from the swirling magic casting shadows across her face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And with one long, deflated sigh, Agatha turned and walked away from the portal.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t dare let her mind linger on the decision. It was done. A decision she and she alone had made. A line drawn in the sand, one she had no intention of crossing. She didn’t want to. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her feet moved without thought, her body drawn by something deeper than reason. By the time she realized where she’d gone, she was standing in front of Rio’s door. A soft, dim light seeped through the thin crack, spilling into the dark hallway.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was awake.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With one steadying breath, Agatha reached for the knob and turned it, pushing the door open. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And there she was. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sitting on her bed, back resting against the headboard, a sketchbook in her lap. A pencil hovered just above the paper, frozen.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio’s too large T-shirt hung loosely on her frame, paired with plaid boxers that barely matched. Her dark brown eyes locked onto Agatha’s, eyebrows raised in quiet inquiry, the unspoken question clear: </span> <em> <span class="s2">What are you doing? </span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t answer. Instead, she let her eyes wander, taking in the room. It wasn’t too different from the one she remembered through Sage’s memories. The layout was similar, but the furniture had a more modern touch, and the crib was notably absent.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her gaze drifted to the nightstand, where a familiar picture frame caught her attention. The drawing of her and Nicky was still there, its lines slightly faded with time but its significance as poignant as ever.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Beside it was a new frame, and the image inside brought a bittersweet smile to her lips. It was a drawing of Sage as a baby, her face lit with pure joy, both arms outstretched toward a cloaked figure. The figure’s back was turned, her cloak billowing slightly, but there was no mistaking Agatha’s presence. The happiness on Sage’s tiny face, her excitement palpable even in the static drawing, made the image feel alive.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was the day Rio tried to tell her of Sage’s existence, the day Agatha acquired the Darkhold. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s chest tightened but surprisingly enough, there was no sorrow there, no shadow of the pain or longing she had expected. Instead, the drawing captured a simple, profound hope. It was a connection between Agatha and her daughter that couldn’t be erased, even by time or circumstance.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She looked away after a moment, her emotions swirling beneath the surface. Yet the warmth of that image lingered, as if it had etched itself into her heart as deeply as it had been sketched onto the page.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze shifted, noticing a few new additions. A door led to what was now a personal bathroom. Against one wall stood a sturdy chest of drawers, a flat screen TV perched neatly on top of it. In the corner of the room was a two-story playpen filled with an assortment of toys scattered and hanging from every edge. Mixed among them were vegetables clearly harvested from Rio’s garden. Then, there was Señor Scratchy sat happily munching on a carrot, his little nose twitching with delight.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The room felt lived in, warm, and calm. It was all very Rio. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s feet carried her toward the playpen. She unlatched the door with practiced ease and swung it open. Reaching inside, she effortlessly plucked Señor Scratchy from his cozy corner, carrot and all, holding the rabbit securely in her hands.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She could feel Rio’s gaze following her every move.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without a word, Agatha crossed the room and settled onto the opposite side of the bed. Mirroring Rio’s position, she leaned back against the headboard, her movements calm. Placing Señor Scratchy on her lap, she held the carrot in front of his twitching nose, watching as he eagerly began to nibble it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio still said nothing. Instead, she closed her sketchbook with an almost meditative care, placing it neatly into the drawer of her bedside table. With a quiet click of the drawer, she adjusted herself, straightening her posture against the headboard. The silence between them stretched, heavy but unspoken. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze stayed fixed on the rabbit in her lap. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t look at her as she reached for the remote, her movements slow and unhurried. The glow of the television flickered to life, illuminating the room with a soft, bluish hue. A few quick clicks later, the screen displayed a documentary about botany, narrated by a smooth, monotonous voice that immediately made Agatha roll her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1">Of course, Rio would pick this. Plants and roots. Earth and life. It was so… her.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t bother masking her disdain. “Really? Plants?” she muttered under her breath.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t respond. She didn’t even glance her way. Her focus remained on the screen, her face calm, unreadable, as though she hadn’t heard a word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sighed, leaning back. For all her frustration, she didn’t press further. She was too tired to argue, too tired to push Rio the way she usually would. The truth was, she hadn’t come here to fight. She hadn’t even come to talk. And for the first time, maybe ever, Agatha wasn’t inclined to press Rio until she broke. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The quiet stretched between them, filled only by the soothing narration of the documentary and the gentle rustle of Rio shifting in her seat. Agatha allowed herself to sink deeper into the mattress, her eyes lazily following the screen even though she wasn’t paying attention. She wasn’t here for the documentary. She wasn’t here for the plants.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She was here for the silence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And for the first time, Agatha found she didn’t resent it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She stole a glance at Rio, who sat beside her with one leg tucked beneath the other, her body angled slightly toward the screen. Her brown hair caught the soft glow of the TV, casting shadows that played across her sharp features. She seemed so focused, as though the world outside didn’t exist. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s chest tightened. It wasn’t often she got to see Rio like this- calm, quiet, unguarded. No Sage hovering over them, no coven breathing down their necks, no endless weight of obligation pressing on their shoulders.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Just them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She turned her attention back to the screen, letting the soothing monotony of the documentary wash over her. She wasn’t particularly interested in the lifecycle of rare orchids, but for once, it didn’t matter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">What mattered was the quiet understanding, the peace of simply existing together. It felt… right.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And for now, that was enough.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let Señor Scratchy down onto the floor, watching as he hopped off to explore the room. She shifted her attention back to the screen, feigning interest in the documentary.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But of the corner of her eye, she saw Rio move.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s hand lowered to rest lightly on the bed between them, her gaze still fixed on the flickering images.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitated, her breath steady but shallow as she moved her hand closer. The space between them disappeared in fractions until her pinky rested just beside Rio’s.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a long moment, nothing happened. The quiet hum of the narrator filled the room, and Agatha began to think she had misread the situation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, Rio’s pinky moved, brushing against hers before curling around it in a delicate, deliberate motion.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze, her heart hammering in her chest. She didn’t dare move, too afraid the moment would shatter. But Rio didn’t pull away, her silent gesture anchoring them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha exhaled softly, her eyes on the screen, but all her focus was on the faint, grounding warmth of Rio’s touch.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">-</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At some point, Agatha must have drifted off, because she was awoken by something poking her cheek. Groaning, she swatted lazily at her face, trying to shove whatever it was away. It worked for all of two seconds before she felt it again, more deliberate this time.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Peeking one eye open, she found Rio sitting cross legged on the bed beside her, calmly poking her cheek with a finger. Agatha blinked in confusion, her mind still foggy with sleep.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><br/>She shot upright, startled, her heart skipping a beat as she remembered where she was. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her gaze landed on Rio, who was already dressed for the day. And for a moment, she feared she’d overstayed her welcome by falling asleep. But Rio didn’t look upset, not even close. Her expression was calm, that neutral mask Agatha hated and yet was beginning to grow use to. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio tilted her head slightly, her brown eyes dragging toward the foot of the bed before returning to Agatha. Curious, Agatha followed her gaze, and there, sitting neatly folded at the edge of the bed, was a set of clothes: a navy woven sweater, light wash jeans, and sitting right on top was a deep purple lacy bra and matching thong.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha arched a brow, glancing back at Rio, who still hadn’t moved, her legs crossed beneath her and her brown </span> <span class="s1">hair framing her face.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Really?” Agatha muttered, a sleepy smirk tugging at the corner of her mouth as her cheeks warmed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t respond. She didn’t need to. Her silence, coupled with the way her gaze flicked back to the clothes and then lazily returned to Agatha, spoke volumes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sighed, running a hand through her disheveled hair. “Subtle as always,” she muttered, but the faint flicker of amusement in her tone betrayed her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t so much as blink. She just sat there, her presence heavy, expectant, leaving Agatha no choice but to swing her legs over the side of the bed and accept the wordless challenge laid out for her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This was new. Before, whenever Rio walked in on Agatha changing, it was always with her in a bra and underwear Rio had chosen, an intimate yet familiar sight. But this was different. It had been centuries since Rio had seen Agatha’s naked body, and worse, Agatha hadn’t seen hers.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Yet here Rio sat, silently asking to see her again. Desperate to see her again. The anticipation hung heavy in the air, sharp enough to cut.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stepped forward, positioning herself in front of the bed. Her movements were slow. She hooked her fingers into the waistband of her pajama pants, tugging them down inch by inch before stepping out of them. Her sweatshirt hung low, just enough to obscure what Rio so desperately wanted to see.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s hands curled into the sheets, her fists tightening against the unmade bedding as she fought to restrain her excitement. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then Agatha reached for the hem of her sweatshirt. In one smooth motion, she pulled it over her head and let it fall to the floor without a second glance. Her eyes locked onto Rio’s and they were ravenous.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s breath hitched as her gaze roamed over Agatha, drinking her in like a starved woman. Agatha knew every curve, every inch of her was etched into Rio’s memory, yet the way the green witch looked at Agatha now felt entirely new. Rio’s breathing grew uneven, the moment charged with an intensity that neither could deny.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stood there, confident and unyielding, and she felt Rio’s resolve coming undone. For all the years of longing, this moment was too much and not nearly enough.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha reached for the thong, dragging it slowly up her legs, her eyes fixed on Rio the entire time. Agatha moved with precision, aware of every breath, every twitch of Rio’s clenched hands. Each motion was deliberate, a performance meant to draw out the tension between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha picked up the bra from the bed, casually turning her back to Rio. The air in the room shifted, the subtle sound of a whimper reaching her ears. She didn’t need to turn around to know the frustration etched on Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She let the bra slip through her fingers and fall to the floor. “Whoops,” she murmured softly, the word barely audible, but the effect immediate.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha bent down slowly, her movements drawn out as though time itself had slowed to match her pace. She stayed there, her body taut with intention, before finally straightening with the bra in hand. She didn’t need to see Rio’s reaction to know it. She could feel it, the weight of Rio’s gaze, the heat of her desire palpable in the air.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Turning back around, Agatha met Rio’s eyes and saw the hunger there. Her chest rose and fell with uneven breaths as she slipped on the bra with ease, each movement designed to hold Rio’s attention. Agatha let herself stand tall, allowing Rio to take her in, her smirk deepening as she watched Rio struggle to hold herself together.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha knew the effect she was having, and she reveled in it. This was her moment, her control and she was going to savor every second of it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio rose from the bed in a single fluid motion, closing the space between them in just two steps. Her brown eyes burned with intent, locked onto Agatha’s as though daring her to look away. The air between them was heavy, suffocating, and the mere inches separating their bodies only amplified the tension.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without a word, Rio lifted a hand, her finger finding the hollow at the base of Agatha’s collarbone. Her touch was feather light but electrifying, her gaze never wavering. Slowly, deliberately, Rio dragged that finger downward, tracing the line of Agatha’s sternum. Agatha’s breath hitched, but she held her ground, refusing to falter under Rio’s unrelenting touch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s finger traveled lower, brushing over the soft skin of Agatha’s stomach, before it paused just above the waistband of her thong. Agatha swallowed hard, her resolve trembling as Rio lingered there. Then, with a confidence that sent a jolt through Agatha, Rio’s finger dipped lower, not beneath the fabric but along the length of it, tracing the cloth with agonizing slowness.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s control teetered, her body betraying her as heat pooled low in her stomach. She wanted to stay steady, to keep the upper hand, but Rio’s touch was devastating. Still, she managed to remain still, even as her breathing grew shallow, matching Rio’s ragged rhythm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s finger retraced its path, sliding back up Agatha’s body, over her sternum, and up to her shoulder before traveling down the length of her arm. Both of their breathing was labored now, heavy and uneven, filling the silence between them. Agatha’s heart pounded as Rio’s hand wrapped around her wrist. It was gentle, yet commanding and she brought it to the waistband of her own shorts.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Agatha could process, Rio guided her hand beneath the fabric, pressing her palm firmly against her. Both women moaned loudly, the sound raw and unrestrained, as Agatha’s hand cupped Rio completely. Their eyes never wavered, locked together in a battle of control and surrender.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">On instinct, Agatha’s fingers slid between Rio’s folds, her movements unthinking, guided by the slickness she found there. Another moan ripped from both of them, Rio trembling under the sensation. Her head fell forward, her forehead pressing against Agatha’s as her breaths came in short, shallow gasps.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s mouth hovered close, her lips parted as though she was seconds away from giving in, from tasting what she’d craved for centuries. But then, with a sharp inhale, she squeezed her eyes shut and tore Agatha’s hand away. The loss was sudden, jarring, and left Agatha gasping for air.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without a word, Rio turned and fled the room, leaving Agatha standing there, panting, her body trembling with the aftermath of what had just happened. Agatha looked down at her hand, her fingers glistening with Rio’s wetness. Her pulse thundered as she brought her hand to her mouth, her tongue dragging slowly over her fingers.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The taste of Rio hit her like a lightning strike, a flavor she hadn’t known in centuries. A low, guttural moan escaped her lips as she licked every trace clean, savoring the memory of Rio, her mind already spinning with the promise of what was to come.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">-</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha hadn’t followed Rio immediately. Instead, she lingered in the house, restless and unable to calm the storm of emotions left in the wake of this morning’s events. Her usual spot in the backyard, where she’d drink her coffee, </span> <span class="s1">felt out of reach. Instead, she settled in the living room, nursing her coffee while her eyes wandered aimlessly.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her gaze landed on the entertainment center beneath the television. Something about it piqued her interest, and she set her mug down, walking over to inspect it. Pulling open one of the drawers, she found an assortment of board games neatly stacked. Nestled among them was a chess set.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before she could dwell on it, the soft sound of footsteps descending the stairs caught her attention. She turned and found Sage on the bottom step with a book in hand, watching her. Agatha raised an eyebrow but said nothing, her hand reaching for the chess set as she turned back to the drawer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Grabbing the box, she straightened and moved toward the backyard. As she passed Sage on the stairs, Agatha jerked her head toward the back door, a silent signal for Sage to follow. Sage hesitated for a moment, then wordlessly fell in step behind her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Instead of heading to the patio swing she usually favored, Agatha made her way to the patio table, setting the chess set down with a soft thud. She slid into one of the chairs and made quick work of opening the box, sorting the pieces with practiced ease.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage had already taken the seat across from her, watching silently. “You ever played?” Agatha asked, her eyes flicking briefly to Sage waiting for a response. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage shook her head, her movements uncharacteristically subdued.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Okay,” Agatha murmured, still focused on the board. “Never too late to learn.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Once the board was set, the first game began. Agatha walked Sage through every move, explaining each piece’s role, the rules of the game, and the strategies that came with it. Her tone was even, patient, and almost soothing as she guided Sage through the process.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage, normally brimming with confidence and sharp remarks, was uncharacteristically quiet. Her eyes stayed fixed on the board, hanging on every word Agatha said as though it held some deeper meaning.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The air between them was calm but charged, a subtle understanding forming as the game unfolded. For the first time, they sat in companionable silence, the clinking of chess pieces and Agatha’s voice were the only sounds breaking the stillness of the backyard.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They had gone through three games in no time, Agatha winning each one with ease. She had tried to go easy on Sage (tried being the key word) but her competitive streak always overpowered her fleeting attempts at kindness. Still, Sage didn’t seem bothered by the losses. Unlike Agatha, Sage didn’t have a sore loser bone in her body. She must’ve inherited that trait from the original green witch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">By the fourth game, they were well into the match when Rio emerged from the garden. Dirt streaked her hands and clothes as she strolled up to the table, her eyes scanning the board with mild curiosity. Agatha, as expected, was in the lead. She crossed her arms over her chest and bit back a smug grin as she watched Sage puzzle over her next move.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage finally made a move, sliding her knight forward. Agatha wasted no time, her queen swiftly capturing the piece.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hah, rookie,” Agatha muttered under her breath, relishing the small victory.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“She’s letting you win,” Rio said casually.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s head snapped up, her brow furrowing as she looked at Rio. “Yeah, right. She hardly knows how to play. And even if she did, no one can beat me at chess.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words had barely left her mouth when Sage moved her bishop.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Checkmate.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha blinked, her head jerking back toward the board. She stared at it in disbelief. <em>How had that even happened?</em> Just two minutes ago, she had been dominating the game. Her eyes darted to Sage, who sat calmly across from her, not even pretending to look smug.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“How did you- ? You don’t even- ? You said you’ve never played!” Agatha sputtered, utterly caught off guard.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage leaned back in her chair, her expression maddeningly neutral. She didn’t say a word, which only made Agatha’s frustration worse.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio smirked, her voice dripping with amusement as she turned to head back toward the garden. “Yeah, she was fucking with you. I taught her how to play when she was seven. Haven’t beaten her since.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s jaw dropped, her eyes narrowing at Sage as she watched Rio disappear down the path. Without hesitation, she quickly began resetting the board.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Again,” she said firmly, her voice leaving no room for argument.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They were halfway through the next game, and Agatha was winning. Sage’s book of poetry sat next to the board, untouched since they’d begun playing. Agatha picked it up, casually flipping through the pages, pretending not to care about the match. She wanted to give off the air of someone entirely confident in her impending victory.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her flipping slowed when she noticed something odd… Several pages were thickly blacked out, as though it had been redacted. She paused, holding the book up.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Why did you do this?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage glanced up at the book, her brow furrowing slightly. “Oh, I didn’t. For whatever reason, my mo- uh, Rio hates Emily Dickinson. Took me forever to figure out that’s who it was. She’s like Voldemort in this house.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze, the name sending a shock of recognition through her. She might know why. Sage caught the shift immediately, her eyes narrowing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You know why she hates her?” Sage asked, curiosity sharp in her voice.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitated, “Maybe.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Tell me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Come on! I’ve been trying to figure it out for forever.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sighed, grumbling under her breath, the answer spilling out before she could stop herself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“</span>
<span class="s2">You slept with Emily Dickinson!</span>
<span class="s1">” Sage shouted, her voice carrying across the yard with such force that Agatha swore every bird in a ten mile radius took flight.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha groaned, dropping her face into her hands, wishing for a moment of peace or perhaps a time machine.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">From somewhere deep in the garden, Rio’s voice bellowed, “Don’t ever say that bitch’s name in my realm again! I mean it!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage flinched slightly, shrinking her shoulders as she leaned closer to Agatha and whispered, “You slept with Emily Dickinson? That makes </span> <span class="s2">so</span> <span class="s1"> much sense. Checkmate.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s head snapped up, her eyes darting to the board. “What?” she yelled, leaning over to double check.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sure enough, Sage’s move had ended the game. Agatha sat back in disbelief, staring at the board and then at Sage, who now looked far too smug for someone who had been pretending not to know how to play.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’ve got to be fucking kidding me,” Agatha muttered, still reeling from the double blow of humiliation. Sage simply grinned and her tongue pressed into her cheek as she leaned back in her chair, entirely victorious.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That night, Agatha found no pajamas folded neatly on the coffee table, as had been the previous unspoken routine. Instead, it was a silent invitation. One she accepted without hesitation. She went straight to Rio’s room.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was sitting on the bed, freshly showered, dressed in clean pajamas, sketchbook and pencil in hand. She glanced up when Agatha entered, her gaze drifting briefly to the plaid pants and sweatshirt folded neatly at the edge of the bed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha wasted no time, walking over and picking up the pajamas, starting to change right there. She felt Rio’s eyes on her the entire time, lingering just a little longer when Agatha pulled her top off, exposing her breasts. Agatha didn’t comment, didn’t push. She wasn’t about to ruin this tentative step forward. As much as she wanted to strip Rio of her clothes and finish what they’d started that morning, she also craved something deeper: conversation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio made no move, her attention flicking back to her sketchbook, though the tension in the room was palpable. Agatha finished changing, exhaling softly as she pulled the sweatshirt over her head and sat down on the other side of the bed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The silence stretched between them, comfortable yet charged. Agatha watched Rio out of the corner of her eye, her hand moving fluidly across the page, her focus intent. She thought of Sage and decided to take a page from her playbook.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“If you could talk to any animal, what would it be?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words left her mouth before she fully thought them through. She glanced at Rio immediately, her stomach tightening. Rio’s eyes were still on her, her face unreadable. For half a second, panic flickered in Agatha’s chest. Hoping she didn’t ruin whatever was going on between them. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Rio, being Rio, didn’t flinch. Her expression didn’t change, her tone calm as she asked, “Plants count as animals?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha nearly cracked a smile, “No.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio gave a disapproving grunt, “Fine. Birds, then. I’d like to know what they’re always yapping about.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Gossiping, probably.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Even better,” Rio said, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. “What about you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Snakes,” Agatha replied easily. “I want to know if Brucie really hates me or if Sage is just projecting.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That earned a soft laugh from Rio, quiet and warm. “You don’t need to talk to snakes to figure that out. Brucie hates everyone. Except Sage.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a soft huff, shaking her head. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shifted slightly, settling deeper against the headboard, her voice lighter now,“Though if you really want to know, I could just ask her for you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha raised an eyebrow, “Oh, so </span> <span class="s2">you</span> <span class="s1"> can talk to snakes now?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio smirked. “No. But I don’t need to. Brucie’s not exactly subtle.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was an unremarkable conversation, but in its simplicity, Agatha felt a weight lift. Just for a moment, it was easy to sit there, to talk about nothing and forget about everything else.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Which made Agatha ask her next question. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Has Sage always been that dramatic? You know, with the whole weather changing according to her mood?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s smirk deepened, a flicker of genuine amusement lighting her expression. “Always,” she said. “Even as a kid. There was one time she read about Christmas in a book I had brought her and realized I’d never told her about it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What happened?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio let out a soft laugh, her voice tinged with nostalgia. “She was ten. She came storming into the garden, book in hand, absolutely furious. I tried to explain that it wasn’t really relevant here, but she wouldn’t hear it. The sky turned gray, thunder rolled in, and I swear it started snowing. She didn’t speak to me for three days.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha blinked, stifling a laugh, “That’s impressive.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio nodded, “Oh, she didn’t stop there. She demanded a full Christmas celebration. She made me decorate the entire house. She even insisted on a turkey dinner. I spent hours in the kitchen trying not to burn the damn thing.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“And did it work?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio smiled faintly, “She forgave me after I let her put a star on top of the tree. She also never let me hear the end of it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha shook her head, finally letting out a soft laugh, “She’s been running the show since day one.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Pretty much,” Rio said, her tone warm. “But hey, the snow was kind of nice. Even if it melted the second she stopped pouting.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The image of a tiny, furious Sage creating a winter wonderland stuck in her mind. Agatha mumbles out, “She’s definitely got your flair for theatrics.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I think we both know exactly where she gets </span> <span class="s2">that</span> <span class="s1"> from.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smirked, but didn’t argue.</span>

<em>It had been a week.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Nothing more had developed with Rio. She’d gone right back to not speaking to Agatha, and depending on the day, it either drove her to the brink of an explosion or left her quietly grateful for the reprieve. Silence could be suffocating, but it could also be safe, a shield from the emotional minefield they were both navigating.</p><p> </p><p>But the way Rio was looking at her now? It was something else entirely. Agatha felt a flush creep up her neck, spreading warmth across her cheeks. Rio’s gaze was intense, focused, like she could stare at Agatha forever and never grow tired of it. It made her feel exposed, like Rio was peeling back layers she didn’t even know were there.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop looking at me like that,” Agatha said, her voice sharper than she intended.</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow, her lips curving into a faint smirk. “Like what?”</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh boy</em>. No silent treatment today, which could only mean one thing: Agatha was about to get her shit rocked. And in her experience with Rio, that could happen in one of two ways: they were either about to fuck or fight. Agatha <em>really, really</em> hoped for the first option.</p><p> </p><p>“Like you want to kiss me,” she said, trying to steer the moment in the direction she preferred. Her voice was steady, but her pulse was racing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze flicked to her lips, and Agatha swore she felt her heart skip a beat. “I always want to kiss you,” Rio said, her voice low, like a confession and a challenge wrapped into one.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. Her body betrayed her, leaning ever so slightly closer as if drawn by an invisible force. “Then do it,” she whispered, her voice carrying a note of plea.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move immediately. Instead, she raised the hand that wasn’t propping up her head and let it hover near Agatha’s face. Slowly, almost agonizingly, she cupped Agatha’s cheek, her thumb swiping gently over her skin in a touch so soft it sent shivers down her spine.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio smiled. “No,” she said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could even process the word, Rio was already pulling away, sitting up, and swinging her legs off the bed. It was only then that Agatha noticed Rio was fully dressed, ready to start her day.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lay there, dumbfounded, as Rio walked toward the door without another glance. When the door clicked shut behind her, Agatha let out a frustrated groan, pressing her hands over her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Unbelievable,” she muttered to no one but herself. She didn’t know whether to scream, laugh, or cry. Maybe all three. All she did know was that Rio had once again left her teetering on the edge of madness, and maybe that was the point.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha got up and dressed, the familiar ache of rejection settling in her chest. She tried to shake it off, but she couldn’t ignore the sting. Rio hadn’t waited to watch her. It was a small thing, but it mattered. It was a routine they’d fallen into, one Agatha had pretended not to love. The quiet intimacy of Rio sitting on the edge of the bed, watching her with that dark, hungry gaze as Agatha slipped on the clothes Rio had laid out for her. It was an unspoken ritual, a thread of connection she hadn’t realized she was clinging to until it was gone.</p><p> </p><p>She made her way to the backyard, the cool morning air brushing against her skin as she stepped outside. Rio was sitting at the patio table, two cups of coffee steaming between them. She was in the chair facing the door, waiting, her brown eyes locked on Agatha the moment she appeared.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, crossed her arms over her chest as she approached, Rio didn’t say a word, just watched her with that infuriating calm, like she had all the time in the world.</p><p> </p><p>“Kiss me.” The words left Agatha’s mouth as more of a demand than a request. Her voice carried a challenge, daring Rio to deny her again.</p><p> </p><p>It was almost absurd how much effort Agatha had to put into something that used to come so easily. Not once, in all the time they’d known each other, had she needed to work for just a kiss. No matter how angry they were at each other, no matter what terrible things they had said to each other, Rio always came back. Always chased her. Always fell to her knees for Agatha Harkness.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move, didn’t flinch, didn’t even blink. She sat there, unphased as always, her coffee cup poised at her lips. The silence stretched unbearably between them, her unwavering gaze pinning Agatha in place like a weight she couldn’t shake.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the burn of tears prickling at the corners of her eyes, the kind of tears she’d sworn she wouldn’t shed. But the lump in her throat was too much to swallow down, the ache in her chest too sharp to ignore.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Agatha said, her voice cracking as the word slipped out through gritted teeth. She hated how desperate she sounded, hated how much it hurt to say it, but she couldn’t stop herself. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides, her nails digging into her palms to ground herself, to keep from breaking further.</p><p> </p><p>Rio set her coffee down slowly, her eyes never leaving Agatha. Rio’s composure wavered for just a moment before she straightened, her voice firm but not unkind. “No. Sit down.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated, her pride warring with her curiosity, but ultimately, she obeyed. She dropped into the chair across from Rio, her arms folded tightly across her chest, a clear signal that she wasn’t about to let her guard down.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“Where’s Sage?” Agatha asked, her tone sharp, deflecting from the emotional tension between them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took a slow sip of her coffee before answering. “Fucking around somewhere on the surface,” she said casually, as if it were the most normal thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “And here I thought I was supposed to be ‘tethered’ to her,” she said, the bitterness in her voice barely concealed.</p><p> </p><p>“I took care of that,” Rio replied smoothly, her gaze steady. “I found the whole thing a tad too belittling, to be honest. What’s that saying? Don’t kick a girl while she’s down.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, momentarily thrown off by the unexpected admission. Rio had always been blunt, but there was something almost… considerate about the way she said it. It didn’t fit with the cold, distant version of Rio she’d been dealing with lately.</p><p> </p><p>“So, what? You’re cutting me loose now?” Agatha asked, her voice tinged with suspicion.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back in her chair, her dark eyes watching Agatha carefully. “Not cutting you loose,” she said, her tone measured. “Just giving you the freedom you seem to crave so much.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted at the words, though she wasn’t sure if it was guilt or anger or maybe both. “And what am I supposed to do with that?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s up to you,” Rio said simply.</p><p> </p><p>The words were calm, but they landed with the weight of a hammer. Agatha clenched her jaw, her arms tightening across her chest, as she fought the urge to lash out. Rio wasn’t making this easy, but then again, Agatha wasn’t sure she deserved easy anymore.</p><p> </p><p>“You told me to leave you alo-“ Rio starts but Agatha cut her off.</p><p> </p><p>“And nine months wasn’t long enough for you?” Agatha shot back, her voice cracking under the strain. “What, you kill my kid and then tell me you did me a favor by giving me time? You’re the one who killed Nicky. You’re the one who hid Sage. Why the hell am I the one being punished?”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t kill <em>our</em> son,” Rio said as her elbow slams hard against the table finger pointed at Agatha. “He died, Agatha. And the sooner you get that through your thick fucking skull, the easier this conversation will be. You don’t get to rewrite history just so you can sleep better at night.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t say anything. She couldn’t. Rio was right. <em>She was always fucking right.</em> It did help her sleep better at night. To put the blame on Rio, to carry that anger instead of the crushing truth. She was too much of a coward to face the fact that there was nothing either of them could have done. No magic, no plan, no desperate attempt could have saved him. And admitting that felt like admitting defeat, like surrendering to a pain she wasn’t strong enough to bear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio took a deep breath, pinching the bridge of her nose as if physically restraining herself from losing her temper. Her voice, when she spoke again, was calm but heavy with the weight of centuries of pain.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky was born of life and death. Both of our children disrupted the sacred balance. Nicky was never meant to live. Sage, on the other hand, could exist, but only with restrictions. Those restrictions confined her to my realm, the middle ground between life and death, because you and I embody Life and Death itself.” She paused, her gaze firm. “Your death restored the balance, allowing Sage to fully live on the surface. Out of death, your death, came life, Sage’s life on the surface.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stiffened, the words cutting deep, but Rio didn’t pause, didn’t flinch.</p><p> </p><p>“Nicky was supposed to be stillborn,” Rio continued, her voice quieter now. “I did us both a favor and you were the only one who reaped its benefits. I gave you everything I had, and you gave me nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fists clenched at her sides, anger rising to meet the sting of guilt threatening to drown her. “I think 200 years with a daughter is more than enough time to make up for that,” she snapped, her voice brittle, defensive.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze narrowed, her lips pressing into a thin line. “You think time makes up for loss?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Deep down she knew Rio wasn’t looking for a response. She was laying the truth bare between them, forcing Agatha to confront the ugly, painful reality she had spent so long running from. And no matter how much it hurt, Rio wasn’t going to let her hide from it any longer.<br/><br/><br/></p><p>“And how do I know that any of this is true?” Agatha shot back, her voice rising. “How do I know that Sage is actually mine and not the kid of some whore you’ve fucked or some figment of your imagination you made up to make yourself feel better?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze, her expression hardening into something cold. For a long moment, she said nothing, her brown eyes fixed on Agatha with an intensity that made the air between them feel suffocating.</p><p> </p><p>“Because, unlike you, our vows actually meant something to me,” Rio said, her voice unwavering, though the pain was evident in her eyes. “They weren’t just words. They were a promise. One I kept, even when you didn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the bile rising in her throat, her stomach twisting painfully. She wanted to vomit, to expel the weight of Rio’s words and the guilt they dragged to the surface. She wasn’t sure how much longer she could sit here, listening, enduring, as Rio stripped her down to the raw, ugly truth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned forward, her gaze steady. “But if you think for one second that I’d spend centuries mourning a child we lost together, only to conjure another out of thin air to manipulate you? Then you never knew me at all.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her throat tightening as the weight of Rio’s words sank in. She opened her mouth to respond, but Rio didn’t give her the chance.</p><p> </p><p>“And for the record,” Rio added, “I’ve loved you through every betrayal, every abandonment, every cruel word you’ve thrown my way. But I won’t let you twist this into something ugly just because you can’t stomach the truth.”</p><p> </p><p>“For three centuries,” Rio continued, her voice trembling with a mix of anger and heartbreak, “you have broken me over and over again. And I let you. I chased you, because I thought if I just ran fast enough, if I gave enough of myself…” Her voice faltered, and she looked away briefly, to gather her composure.</p><p> </p><p>“I stood by you when the world turned its back on you,” Rio said, her tone quieter now, though no less raw. “I fought for you when you couldn’t even fight for yourself. And every single time you tore me apart, I told myself it was okay, because deep down I thought you loved me back. That you wanted me back as much as I wanted you.”<br/><br/></p><p>Rio swallowed hard, her gaze dropping for a moment before she looked back at Agatha, her brown eyes glistening with unshed tears. “But I…” Her voice cracked, and she paused, taking a shaky breath. “But I think I was wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>The words landed heavy between them, the quiet honesty of them cutting deeper than any shout or accusation could have.</p><p> </p><p>“You were born of chaos, Agatha Harkness,” Rio said, her voice steady but filled with frustration. “And you can’t live without it. You act like a fucking fool without it.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not true…. I can be good,” Agatha choked out through her tears, her voice trembling and broken.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want you to be good,” Rio replied, her tone steady but filled with an ache that matched Agatha’s. “I want you to stop searching for chaos to define you. I want you to choose me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m still so mad at you,” Agatha chokes out, her voice thick with emotion. She was so torn, caught between love and anger, between grief and longing.</p><p> </p><p>“I know,” Rio said softly, her tone calm. “But you can’t expect me to hold your hand while you figure it out. I’m tired.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me about her on the road?” Agatha demanded, wiping a hand aggressively down her tear streaked cheeks, desperate to dry the tears that wouldn’t stop falling.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you have believed me? Was I supposed to mention it,” Rio began, her voice tight with restrained frustration, “in between you thinking that abomination was your son and accusing me of coming to steal him away? Or maybe when your mother told you she should’ve killed you the moment you left her body? Tell me, Agatha, when exactly would it have been the right time?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, running a hand through her hair. “I tried. All I’ve done for 200 years is try. But you made it impossible. You always make it impossible.”</p><p> </p><p>That part was true. The road had been brutal, unforgiving in every way. Even if Rio had told her outright that she had a daughter, Agatha wouldn’t have believed her. She would have dismissed it as a lie, a cruel trick to manipulate her when she was already on the edge of breaking.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing Rio could have said or done would’ve made Agatha choose her. Not then. Not when chaos consumed her, and grief clouded her every thought.</p><p> </p><p>Even now, sitting across from Rio, Agatha had questioned the validity of Sage being hers, despite the undeniable resemblance. Sage had Agatha’s piercing intellect, the way her mind worked three steps ahead of everyone else. She had her persistence, her ability to focus so completely on a goal that nothing could distract her. Even her moments of quiet, those reflective pauses where she seemed to calculate every move, were unmistakably Agatha. But even that hadn’t been enough to silence the doubts Agatha clung to, doubts that felt safer than accepting the truth staring her in the face.</p><p> </p><p>By this point, Agatha was all cried out. She sat there, drained, her body heavy with exhaustion. She swore she had never cried more in her entire life than she had in these last two weeks.</p><p> </p><p>She had always kept the gates closed, knowing what would happen if she let them open even a crack. It wasn’t just sadness that would spill out, it was everything. The anger, the guilt, the longing, the grief she had buried so deep it had become a part of her. Once it started, it wouldn’t stop, and she had spent centuries convincing herself she couldn’t afford that kind of vulnerability.</p><p> </p><p>But now? The gates were broken, and she didn’t know how to put them back together. All she could do was sit there and endure, her heart raw and exposed, hoping she had the strength to face whatever came next.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat up a little straighter, summoning the strength she had left. The question burned in her throat, but she forced it out.</p><p> </p><p>“And Nicky. Is he…” Her voice faltered. She cleared her throat, trying to muster the courage to finish, but the words wouldn’t come.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, being Rio, gave her the grace of not having to say it. “He’s at peace,” she said softly.<br/><br/></p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, and when she spoke again, her voice was barely above a whisper. “How do you know?” The desperation in her tone was impossible to hide. She knew Rio had no ties to the afterlife, no direct connection to the place where Nicky might be. And yet, she had still chosen to keep him away from his mother.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated, her gaze dropping to the table as if weighing how much to reveal. Finally, she spoke, her voice quieter now. “Sage… she has ties to the afterlife. Being born of life and death, it’s a part of her nature. She goes there when she sleeps.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, her chest tightening as Rio continued.</p><p> </p><p>“She sees him every night.”</p><p> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And honestly, that was maybe one of the worst answers Agatha could have received. Now she had to face the truth she had been avoiding. Not only had she kept Nicky from Rio, but even Sage had gotten to know him in a way Rio never could.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had nothing. No memories to hold onto, no moments to cherish, no chance to love their son as a mother should. Agatha had made sure of that. Worse still, she had made Rio watch from a distance as she raised him. Agatha had drawn the line, keeping Rio on the other side, forced to witness fleeting glimpses of a life she would never be a part of.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Now, as the weight of it all came crashing down on her, Agatha couldn’t hide from the truth any longer. She hadn’t just taken Nicky from Rio. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She had taken everything, and there was no way to undo it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Maybe I am evil. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Even with all this darkness consuming her, even with the weight of guilt and regret pressing down on her, there was a small light at the end of the tunnel. A small flicker of peace that threatened to claw its way through the storm inside her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Nicky wasn’t alone. He was at peace. He had his sister.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But of course, Agatha fought it, as feelings of jealousy rose to smother that fragile calm. Sage had gotten time with Nicky. Time that Agatha had never allowed herself to have. Time she had been too much of a coward to claim because she couldn’t face him after everything she’d done.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And now, this girl she hardly knew, this daughter she hadn’t raised, had spent two centuries with him. Two centuries that Agatha had robbed from herself. The thought burned, twisting her heart in ways she hadn’t been prepared for. It wasn’t fair, and yet, she knew she had no one to blame but herself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha went to open her mouth, but Rio stopped her, raising a hand as if she could physically halt whatever venom Agatha was about to unleash.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With another pointed finger and a voice edged with warning, Rio said, “Don’t. Don’t fucking say anything about her. You can be a dick to me all you want, but leave <em>my</em> daughter out of this.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Oh.</span></em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">So that’s what it felt like. To have the title of mother stripped away as though it meant nothing. Words Agatha herself had thrown at Rio countless times, used to rip another piece of her away, to tarnish her, to remind her of what she wasn’t allowed to have.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And now, the shoe was on the other foot, and it hurt more than Agatha had ever imagined it could. The realization hit her like a punch to the gut, leaving her silent, her retort dying on her tongue.</span>
</p><p> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sat frozen as Rio stood and said, “We need a break from this.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her tone was calm but carried the finality of someone who couldn’t take any more. Agatha nodded stiffly, her eyes glued to the forgotten coffees on the table. She couldn’t bring herself to look at Rio, not with the weight of everything they had just said pressing down on her like a physical force.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She watched from the corner of her eye as Rio made her way to the garden, her steps tired and heavy. Agatha stayed where she was, unable to move, her mind spinning. After a few moments, she glanced out the window and saw Rio throwing herself into the plants, her hands working quickly, methodically. It didn’t surprise her. The garden had always been Rio’s safe place, her way of finding order when everything else was chaos.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sat for a moment longer, then dragged herself to her feet, her body feeling as weighed down as her mind. She wandered toward the willow tree across the garden, not entirely sure why.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The memorial beneath the tree caught her attention immediately. The etched words were faded but unmistakably cared for. A fresh bouquet of white lilies rested on top, their brightness contrasting sharply with the dark soil around them. Agatha knew this was Rio’s doing. Everything about the space, from the carefully tended grass to the absence of even a stray leaf, spoke of Rio’s quiet devotion.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha lowered herself to the ground, her legs folding beneath her. Eventually, she lay back, staring up through the branches of the tree as they swayed gently in the breeze. The earth beneath her felt solid, grounding her in a way she hadn’t expected. For the first time in weeks, the chaos inside her mind seemed to quiet.</span>
</p><p> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She didn’t know how long she stayed there, letting the stillness settle over her. When the sun began to dip below the horizon, she finally stood and made her way back inside, exhaustion pulling her toward the couch. She collapsed onto it, her thoughts still too tangled to make sense of.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The sound of the shower running broke her trance, but she didn’t move. Not until she heard the soft creak of Rio’s door opening and the familiar sound of footsteps in the hallway.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha looked up and saw Rio standing in the entrance to the living room, her eyes filled with a quiet sadness, her arms crossed loosely over her chest.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>“Come to bed, Agatha,” she said softly before disappearing down the hall.</p><p> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a moment, Agatha stayed frozen, her mind spinning with too many thoughts and none at all. But she didn’t resist. She stood and followed, her legs moving almost on their own. She didn’t have the strength to argue, and she wasn’t sure she wanted to.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>She followed Rio into the bathroom and she gestured for Agatha to step forward.</p><p> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without a word, she reached for Agatha’s shirt, tugging gently for her to lift her arms. Agatha hesitated, the vulnerability of the moment almost too much, but (of course) she obeyed. Rio stripped her clothes away piece by piece, her movements quiet and deliberate.</span>
</p><p> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio guided her into the shower, Agatha assumed she would walk away. Instead, Rio stepped in after her, fully clothed, her expression focused. She avoided Agatha’s eyes, they did not linger on her body. Keeping her focus on the task at hand as Rio reaches for the shampoo.</span>
</p><p> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s hands were steady as she lathered the soap into Agatha’s hair, her fingers working through the tangles with practiced care. The water cascaded over both of them, soaking Rio’s clothes as she worked, but she didn’t seem to care.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha closed her eyes, her breathing unsteady. Rio’s touch wasn’t hurried or cold; it was tender in a way that felt overwhelming. It wasn’t about intimacy or passion.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was about care.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>Once the water was off, Rio stepped out first, grabbing a towel and wrapping it around Agatha’s shoulders. She dried her off, careful and methodical, before helping her into clean pajamas. As Agatha sat on the edge of the bed, Rio changed in to dry clothes and retrieved a hairbrush. She gently began working through Agatha’s damp hair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak, but her hands moved with the same care Agatha was beginning to associate with her. The rhythmic strokes of the brush felt oddly comforting, soothing in a way Agatha hadn’t expected. She didn’t protest, letting herself sink into the quiet intimacy of the moment.</p><p> </p><p>When they finally lay down, Rio turned on the TV. <em>The Real Housewives of New York City</em> filled the room.</p><p> </p><p>“Milfs who get drunk and scream at each other,” Rio said casually, her voice a little lighter. “Trash reality TV always makes everything better.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t help the scoff that escaped her. For a brief moment, the corner of her mouth twitched upward. She didn’t say anything, though, as her attention shifted to the screen.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t Agatha’s kind of distraction, but it worked. The noise in her mind quieted. She didn’t admit it out loud, but the show, and Rio beside her, made her feel a little better.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio, lying next to her, didn’t mention it either. They didn’t need to.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>—</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha woke before the sun. The dim light of the early morning barely touched the room, and for a moment, she simply lay there, her gaze drifting over the familiar shadows. She turned her head slightly, only to see Rio stirring, slipping out of bed.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio moved quietly, her steps soft as she disappeared into the bathroom. Agatha stayed still, her heart oddly steady in her chest as she listened to the faint sound of water running. When Rio returned, her movements were fluid as always, but when their eyes met, Rio faltered.</p><p> </p><p>It was clear she hadn’t expected Agatha to be awake. The surprise in her expression was brief, replaced quickly by a neutral calm, but it was enough to tell Agatha she wasn’t the only one feeling uncertain.</p><p> </p><p>And if Rio left the bedroom without a word, her steps purposeful but not hurried. Agatha hesitated for only a moment before following, not bothering to change out of her sleep clothes. The cool morning air hit her skin as she stepped outside, finding Rio standing across the garden beneath the willow tree, her back to Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>If Rio turned slowly, her eyes meeting Agatha’s with a silent question, prodding gently, <em>Are you sure?</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a single nod, her voice only a whisper, “Show me.”</p><p> </p><p>If Rio held her gaze for a long moment before nodding in return. She turned, gesturing for Agatha to follow as she led the way to the stone memorial beneath the willow. Her movements were precise, her presence calm and steady as she began to show Agatha the care it required.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio’s words were soft, barely above a whisper, guiding Agatha through the motions. Rio showed her how to clear the grass, how to brush the dirt away without disturbing the stone, and how to make the space feel whole again. There was no rush, only a quiet, deliberate rhythm to her actions, as if each movement carried weight and purpose.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio led Agatha to the patch of white lilies growing in the garden, she knelt, carefully selecting six blooms to trim. She placed them in Agatha’s hands without a word, her gaze lingering for a moment before she stood again.</p><p> </p><p>If they made their way back to the memorial, and for the first time, Agatha found herself kneeling beside Rio in front of the stone.</p><p> </p><p>If Rio handed her a small braid of twine: one purple, one green, and one black seamlessly woven together. Her words remained soft as she guided Agatha through the process of tying it around the bouquet. The instructions were gentle, her tone steady in a way that made the moment feel sacred.</p><p> </p><p>If when the bouquet was ready, Agatha’s fingers trembled as she reached forward, placing it in the same spot she’d seen it before. The gesture felt heavier than she’d expected, the silence around them wrapping her in its quiet embrace.</p><p> </p><p>If any of that had happened, it was no one’s business but Agatha’s own.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Another week had passed in Rio’s realm. Sage still hadn’t returned from the surface, which left Agatha feeling torn. Some days she relished the quiet, grateful for the lack of interruptions. Other days, the stillness gnawed at her nerves, and she’d catch herself fidgeting, chewing the inside of her cheek. Her patience wore thin as she poked and prodded Rio for answers.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">But Rio, unbothered as always, never had an answer. Never worried. Never seemed to wonder what their girl (practically flung out into the world like a newborn, wobbling and naive, with no one there to catch her if she falls) had been doing all this time.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio only ever offered a shrug, her hands perpetually occupied, “She’ll be fine.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Leaving Agatha in utter disbelief, every time. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Their days together fluctuated wildly. Some mornings were peppered with lazy conversations that came easy, as though the years of tension between them had dissolved. Other times, Rio seemed to make it her personal mission to see how far she could push Agatha before her temper flared.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was always over the most trivial things, never serious, but maddening all the same. If Rio had lived another life as an author, her best-selling work would undoubtedly be titled: </span> <em> <span class="s2">Poking the Bear: A Beginner’s Manual. </span> </em></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">One example: The Tea Incident. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha leaned against the counter, her sharp eyes tracking Rio’s every move like a hawk about to swoop. Her thumbnail hovered near her mouth, a nervous habit she hadn’t quite shaken, as she watched Rio fumble around the stove.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“You’re steeping it too long,” Agatha said, breaking the silence, “You’ll burn the leaves.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s hand froze mid-stir, and her head snapped up. “I didn’t realize you were a tea expert,” she said, deadpan, though the slight lift of her brow betrayed her amusement.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s2">Lie.</span></em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">That was a lie, and they both knew it. This was an argument older than either of them cared to admit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Rio had always been shit at making tea, and Agatha, the perfectionist that she is, had long since mastered it.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“And I didn’t realize you enjoyed drinking dirt water,” Agatha shot back without missing a beat.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">With an exaggerated clatter, Rio dropped the spoon into the pot and spun to face her. She threw her hands up dramatically, her voice dripping with mock sincerity.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Oh, forgive me, Your Highness,” Rio said, pressing a hand to her chest like she was delivering a heartfelt apology. “Queen of All Things Proper. Care to bless me with your divine technique?” She gestured grandly to the pot, stepping aside like a performer leaving the stage.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t hesitate. She stepped forward, shoving Rio aside with zero ceremony. “It’s not my fault you lack basic skills.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio, unbothered, leaned back against the counter, her grin beginning to break through.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was only a matter of time before her stupid tongue pressed into her stupid cheek. “It’s tea, Agatha, not brain surgery.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Watching you make tea is like losing brain cells in real time,” Agatha fired back, expertly taking over the task with practiced ease.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio tilted her head. And there it is. That smug expression settling in place as she pressed her tongue into her cheek. “You’re awfully bold for someone standing this close to a pot of hot water.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Threatening me won’t change the fact that you’re incompetent,” Agatha said primly, but the corner of her mouth twitched.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">They never knew what each new day would bring during Sage’s absence. It was always different, unpredictable, yet somehow they both found themselves silently looking forward to whatever the next day would hold.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Though two things remained the same each day.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Every morning, just before dawn, Rio would nudge Agatha awake. They’d wordlessly rise and tend to Nicky’s memorial. Rio’s soft instructions from their first time doing this together no longer needed repeating; Agatha had memorized every detail. Some mornings they worked side by side, the quiet broken only by the sounds of their task. Other mornings, Rio would leave her to it, giving Agatha space to breathe in the absence of chaos. And then, routinely, they’d move on, as if those moments had never happened.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Every night ended the same way, too. Agatha no longer slept on the couch. Instead, she found herself in bed with Rio. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s2">Always in silence, always at a distance.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s intentions were clear: to keep her close but never too close. Whatever intimacy had sparked between them before seemed to have been extinguished the day Rio had refused her a kiss. No lingering touches. No hungry eyes. Just silence.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Some nights, Agatha accepted it without complaint, understanding the unspoken boundaries Rio was trying to hold. Other nights, it tore at her, the distance so tangible it made her skin prickle. She’d fight the urge to demand something, anything, from Rio. A kiss, a touch, even the brush of a pinky against hers. But Rio gave her nothing, and Agatha was left in the dark, trying to be okay with it.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t dwell on it, refused to. It would ruin her. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">One morning, Rio let Agatha help with her massive, sprawling garden. Agatha wasn’t exactly skilled, but Rio, an endless source of knowledge on botany, showed her the ropes. Agatha wasn’t the most attentive student, her patience often frayed by Rio’s unrelenting corrections, but there was something about the rhythm of planting and pruning that she didn’t mind.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Another day, Agatha stumbled upon the study, hidden behind two large sliding doors. Sunlight streamed through oversized windows, illuminating walls covered in ceiling to floor bookshelves, each shelf packed to capacity. The desk in the center was covered in a chaotic sprawl of books and papers. It didn’t take long for Agatha to realize this room was frequented by both Rio and Sage. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Though, judging by the state of disarray, it was mainly used by Sage. The organized chaos bore a striking resemblance to the state of Sage’s bedroom.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">While surveying the room, Agatha’s attention was caught by a large glass enclosure. Empty. When she noticed it, Rio casually explained that Petunia, her tarantula, often roamed the garden freely.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Each day felt different, unfamiliar, but somehow grounding in its own strange way.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">One particular day, after a morning coffee made by Rio, </span> <span class="s2">not tea</span><span class="s1">. </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s2">Thank god.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha found herself in Rio’s bedroom with an overwhelming urge to snoop. And snoop she did.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Most of it was uninteresting, little glimpses of Rio’s life that didn’t reveal much. But then her eyes landed on the bedside table. Her heart skipped.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Every so often, Agatha would catch Rio sketching in that damn notebook, the one she always kept close. Agatha would never willingly admit to being nosy, but here she was, ripping the drawer open. Her fingers reached for the sketchbook, but something else caught her eye. Tucked into a corner, nearly hidden, were two rings on a string.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">One was carved from bone, its surface smooth and worn, the inside etched in delicate cursive: </span> <em> <span class="s2">In You, I Begin.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The other was dark wood, faintly polished, its inscription reading: </span> <em> <span class="s2">In Death, I Remain.</span> </em></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze, her breath catching in her throat.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio hadn’t wanted rings. That had been entirely Agatha’s idea. They meant something to Agatha at one point. They were symbols of a love that could withstand the weight of time. And Rio, who would have moved mountains for her, had made them anyway.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She could remember Rio’s hands, rough and careful, spending weeks crafting them. Dozens of prototypes discarded until Rio finally got it right. The words, too, were plucked from their spoken commitment, vows Agatha barely remembers now. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">And yet, Rio had kept them.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The wood ring had been Agatha’s. She had worn it the first day of Nicky’s life, a small, private gesture to keep them all close. She thought it might bring Rio comfort, as if wearing it was a gift. But by the next day, she’d gotten rid of it. She didn’t even remember how or where, only that she couldn’t endure it. It was too much. Too heavy. Too painful.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Now, here they were, resting quietly in the corner of a drawer.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha picked them up, cradling them in her hand. She expected the touch to burn, to hurt, and it did. But not in the way she thought it would. There was no hatred there, only regret. A soft ache that settled into her chest like an old bruise. It hurt, but it wasn’t suffocating.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She held the rings a moment longer before tucking them back into the drawer, her fingers lingering over the smooth surface of the bone. And then, quietly, she closed it.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha left Rio’s bedroom, her mind still a little hazy, and wandered toward the study. She swept her gaze across the towering bookshelves, overwhelmed by the sheer number of books lining the walls. The abundance of knowledge, so carefully collected, made her head spin. On a whim, she plucked a book at random from the shelf, not even glancing at the title, and headed straight to the backyard.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She planted herself in her usual seat at the table, the one where she often sat to watch Rio from a distance. But today, watching from afar was not enough.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">With a resolute sigh, Agatha dragged the chair loudly and ungracefully across the cobblestone path all the way to the pond where Rio was working. She did not bother muting her irritation, grumbling under her breath about the length of the walk and cursing the effort it took to move the chair. By the time she reached the pond, she was out of breath and muttering a stream of inappropriate language.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">With dramatic flair, Agatha plopped the chair down with a heavy thump, the sound scraping against the stones as she planted herself directly across from where Rio knelt. The green witch was carefully cleaning natural debris from the water’s surface.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio paused mid motion, looking up to stare at Agatha, confusion etched into her face.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha knew she was invading Rio’s space, more than just her physical space. This was Rio’s sacred space, the one place where Agatha had always tread carefully.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Until now, her presence here had always been on Rio’s terms. Even the day they had spent together in the garden, when Rio was teaching her the careful art of maintaining its beauty, had been under Rio’s guidance. Even when Rio led her into the garden the morning she had shown Agatha how to care for the white lilies, the approval unspoken but clear. Agatha had only entered this space when invited, stopping at the edge until Rio’s silent nod welcomed her in. The willow tree was the only neutral ground, a place that required no permission.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">But this was different. This was deliberate. Agatha has chosen to sit here, in Rio’s sacred space, with no invitation and no permission. Wanting nothing more than Rio’s presence and the view of Rio’s face unobstructed by distance.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She crossed her legs, flipping the book open for show, and pointedly gestured toward Rio and the garden with a lazy spin of her finger.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“You know you are the green witch, right?” she said, her voice lightly teasing. “You could poof some magic and skip the manual labor. Work smarter, not harder, no?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t respond, and she didn’t need to. Agatha already knew the answer. This space wasn’t about convenience or efficiency; it was a part of Rio, a living testament to centuries spent proving something to herself. Or maybe, proving someone else (definitely Agatha) wrong. Every inch of this garden was Rio’s quiet rebellion, her way of showing that Death could do more than take. She could create life, nurture it, and make it beautiful. The garden stood as the perfect complement to the ultimate proof: the daughter she has raised so successfully.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio pulled her eyes away from Agatha and returned to cleaning the pond, though she failed miserably at hiding the genuine smile tugging at her lips. A quiet huff of laughter escaped her as she shook her head slightly, as if trying to make sense of the situation. The smile lingered, growing wider now, revealing the small gap between her teeth as she continued her work.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">And in an effort to ignore the soaring of her heart at the sight of that damn little gap </span> <span class="s1">toothed smile, Agatha buried her nose in the book. She managed to read the first five sentences at least ten times before the words began to stick, too distracted by the annoyingly beautiful presence in front of her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The book was a literary nonfiction about the sea, filled with poetic reflections on tides, marine life, and the mysteries of the deep.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out an obnoxiously loud groan. The book was “Boring!” she announced to no one, throwing her head back dramatically. Still, despite her proclamation, she turned back to the book. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Its pages were peppered with annotations, the handwriting most likely Sage’s. Unlike Rio’s more flowing script, Sage’s handwriting was precise, slanting heavily to the right like that of a lefty. The annotations struck a balance, blending notes of curiosity and fascination as though Sage had been reading the book for both pleasure and study. Agatha continued reading pretending to ignore every single note and annotation Sage carefully crafted. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The next day, they were in a different part of the garden. Agatha had dragged her chair all the way to the vegetable patch with Sage’s old book in hand. She planted herself just outside the rows of veggies. Petunia, Rio’s familiar, rested lazily on Agatha’s shoe. Rio’s tarantula had been around longer than Agatha could remember, and, not to brag, but the little thing had always favored her. Agatha chalked it up as just another reason to tease Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha wears navy high waisted, wide legged dress pants paired with a crisp white collared blouse. She had no idea why she even bothered dressing nicely out here, but sue her for wanting to look good… Even if she knew damn well she hadn’t picked these clothes out herself.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio looked beautiful that day (per usual, Agatha fights back a scoff threatening to escape at the mushy thought). Her hair was partially pulled back at the top, secured in a half up, half down style, with loose strands and curtain bangs framing her face delicately. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">It was shorter than Agatha had ever seen it, just grazing above her shoulders. She looked so different from the time Agatha had known her on the surface. Agatha had noticed the change immediately the first time she caught a glimpse of Rio. That first day at the bottom of the stairs, where Rio, out of Death’s uniform, had refused to let Agatha see her. The color of her hair was lighter here, and her entire appearance seemed eerily human. Her energy, once daunting and otherworldly, now breathed life.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A few days after Sage had left, Agatha finally brought it up, her curiosity gnawing at her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s2">“Why do you look different here? Yo-” Agatha stumbled, suddenly hesitant to overstep, but the question persisted, tumbling out in pieces. “Your hair… it’s shorter. And lighter. For fuck’s sake, you even have… what? Curtain bangs?” She huffed a laugh at the absurdity of the thought, the stark difference in Rio’s appearance catching her off guard again as she spoke.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s2">Rio, sitting back against the headrest with the remote in hand, had paused her movement, her fingers halting as she was pulling up the reality show they’d been watching together. She dragged her eyes away from the TV, landing them on Agatha. Her face remained neutral, the question seemingly not fazing her.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s2">She said nothing, only shrugged and returned her attention to the TV, her expression unchanged as she resumed scrolling.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s2">Agatha didn’t press for an answer. She was fine with the silence. After all, she was a smart woman. She’d already somewhat pieced together the answer herself. Maybe she just wanted Rio to say it. Or maybe, deep down, she wanted Rio to know that she had noticed. That she was watching and lingering, just as Rio always had been.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s2">Still, the question lingered in her mind. Was this change in Rio’s appearance a personal choice, an intentional step toward appearing more human, despite her existence as a cosmic entity? Or was it this place itself. Once a vast, endless green void now brimming with life that had subtly transformed Rio? Perhaps it wasn’t a choice at all, but a natural consequence of this world overflowing with so much vitality that even Death herself couldn’t help but appear more human, a little less cosmic, than she had since the beginning of time.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha pulls her thoughts away from the memory and turns back to her book. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Everything seemed normal, dangerously close to peaceful, until Agatha caught a shift in Rio’s posture. She froze in place, hands pausing in the process of picking vegetables. Slowly, Rio leaned back, resting back on to her calves, as her hands lie gently on top of her thighs. Her shoulders slumped, the usual calm on her face melting into something heavier, something fragile. Her brows furrowed as she stared at the ground, her expression weighted with quiet heartbreak.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha jerked upright, planting her feet firmly on the ground. Her grip on the arms of her chair turned iron clad, knuckles white with tension. The sudden movement sent Petunia scurrying away, but Agatha didn’t notice.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“What?” Her voice cut sharply through the air, loud and demanding.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s gaze rose slowly to meet hers. Her brown eyes, filled with sorrow, locked onto Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“I have to go.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The words hit harder than Agatha was expecting. She knew what Rio meant. She was being called in to work, and somehow, Agatha had let herself forget that this was still part of Rio’s life. Anger flared hot and unrelenting in her chest. How could she have been so stupid?</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio stood, stepping carefully over the line of vegetables and moving closer to her. Agatha mirrored her, rising from the chair.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“No.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Agatha.” Rio’s voice was soft, her tone carrying the faintest hint of a warning.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha’s fists clenched at her sides, nails biting into her palms. Her face twisted as she fought to keep her emotions in check. The questions came unbidden, clawing at her mind</span> <span class="s2">, </span> <span class="s1">ready to break free at any moment. What was so significant that Rio needed to step in? Or worse, what was so terrible that Rio had chosen to handle it herself?</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“What happened?” Agatha blurted out, her voice a rush of desperation. Her eyes searched Rio’s face for answers, for any sign that this was something minor. </span> <span class="s2">It was never minor. </span> <span class="s1"> But Rio’s expression didn’t falter. There was only sorrow.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Still, the name slipped from Agatha’s lips, unbidden and trembling. “Sage? Is she… she’s okay?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The words carried no accusation, no bitterness. Only a raw, pleading need for reassurance. Agatha hoped Rio could see how hard she was trying, how much she was holding herself back. She wanted to scream, to grab Rio by the collar of her shirt and demand, ‘</span> <em> <span class="s2">Don’t you dare do this to me again.’</span> </em></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s2"><em>I don’t even know her yet</em>, </span> <span class="s1">the thought screaming at Agatha. </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">But Rio didn’t flinch. Her eyes softened, holding a quiet understanding that caught Agatha off guard.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“She’s fine.” Rio’s voice did not waver and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>it was infuriatingly neutral. It’s the tone she always used when she was beginning to slip into her role as Death, and Agatha hated it. She gritted her teeth, swallowing back the urge to grab her and beg her not to change.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s2">Not yet.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“You don’t know that,” Agatha said, her voice biting, though the anger faded at the edges.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Believe me. I do.” Rio’s reply was quiet but firm, her eyes locked onto Agatha’s as if anchoring herself there. The weight in her gaze felt like the only thing keeping Rio grounded, drowning in the endless sea of Agatha’s blue eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Promise me,” Agatha whispered, the words barely audible but heavy with demand.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s shoulders sank, and her gaze faltered.“I…” Her voice cracked, quiet and fragile, before growing steadier. “I would feel it. I know I would.” She pressed a hand to her chest, absentmindedly rubbing at the spot with a heavy palm, seeming to try and reassure herself. Remind herself. “But I can’t promise that.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t scream, didn’t shout, didn’t push for a promise Rio couldn’t make. She had learned that lesson the hard way. Instead, she reached into the pocket of her pants and grasped her brooch, squeezing it tightly in her hand. Agatha inhaled deeply, letting the shaky breath out through her nose.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She nodded once.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Taking a slight angled step back, so she could let Rio go. But Rio didn’t move. She stood there, lingering still so close to Agatha. Her brown eyes softened, and for a moment, it looked like she wanted to kiss her before she went. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha would have let her. She wanted her to.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">They both wanted it. To pour everything into the other’s mouth, to taste every last inch of each other before Rio left. Before Rio might once again stoke the fire Agatha had torn herself apart to calm. The fire that had raged within her for centuries, consuming everything in its path. For the first time in so long, it had finally quelled some. But now it felt like they were only seconds, moments, or days away from reigniting it completely. Flames that, once caught, would burn out of control and never be extinguished.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">But Rio didn’t kiss Agatha. The absence of it might have shattered her, if not for the piercing gaze of Rio’s brown eyes. They held something unspoken, a quiet assurance that she wasn’t leaving forever,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>that she would not return bearing the weight of their daughter’s soul guided to the afterlife. They had time. For now, they all still had time.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">But it could not be a promise. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha unwillingly tore her eyes away from Rio’s and stepped aside, out of the green witch’s path entirely. Her gaze dropped to the cobblestone below, unable to watch her go just yet. All she caught was the passing sight of Rio’s dirt-covered white shoes as they moved steadily down the garden’s path.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Once out of her direct line of sight, Agatha’s head turned to the right, her eyes trailing Rio as she walked away. With every step, Rio stood taller, her strides growing more confident, more deliberate. Agatha felt her stomach twist as she watched the transformation. Gone was </span> <span class="s2">her</span> <span class="s1"> Rio, the one in the familiar navy crewneck and gray shorts, with dirt smudged across her legs and hands, her hair that natural, earthy brown Agatha never got to see on the surface.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">In her place was Death. The long, two toned black cloak flowed behind her, trailing like shadows in her wake. It hung softly off her shoulders, revealing that sinfully beautiful top that exposed more and more skin the longer Agatha looked. Her hair was now pitch black and Death’s crown rested atop her head. Death pulled the hood over herself with practiced ease.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The only parts of Death still visible were the tips of her three fingers, sharp with clip-on metal nails. Her right hand gripped her dagger tightly. In her left hand, she loosely held a single lily between her fingers, its stark white petals trembling slightly in the breeze.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A green portal suddenly tore through the air in front of her. Without hesitation, Death strode toward it, her movements fluid and sure. She didn’t stop to look back, didn’t throw Agatha one last glance. Agatha knew she wouldn’t. Rio would never taint the fragile peace they had just begun to rebuild with the face of Death. She wouldn’t allow it.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">In the blink of an eye, Lady Death was gone, and the portal vanished with her, leaving only the faintest trace of green light behind.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha spent the first hour pacing the length of the living room, her steps quick and uneven, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. Every few minutes, her eyes darted to the clock on the wall, the minutes dragging by at a maddeningly slow pace. There’s really no sense of time here but Rio did everything possible to give balance to a daughter who had defied its existence.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her thoughts spun out of control, latching onto worst case scenarios. She imagined Rio returning sickly and hollow… Worse, returning with a weight impossible for either of them to bear. The idea made her stomach twist, and she had to stop, pressing the heels of her palms against her eyes hoping to steady herself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Eventually, she forced herself to sit, plopping onto the couch with a huff and snatching the remote from the table. Agatha needed a distraction, something mindless, and landed on </span> <em> <span class="s2">The Real Housewives of New York City</span> </em> <span class="s1">. She told herself it was just background noise, but thirty minutes later, she found herself yelling at the TV, her outrage at petty arguments momentarily replacing her worry. It worked until she caught herself gripping the remote too tightly, her knuckles white, the stress sneaking back in as an unwelcome guest.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">By the fourth hour, Agatha was on her feet again, pacing from one end of the room to the other. She stayed away from Rio’s bedroom, unwilling to step inside the space where the green witch’s presence still lingered. It felt too intimate, too much like an admission of how desperately she wanted Rio back. Instead, she planted herself in the living room, pacing, stopping only to stare out the window as though expecting to see Rio stride through the garden at any moment. Her mind cycled endlessly between imagining what Rio might be doing and reprimanding herself for the sheer absurdity of her own restlessness.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At one point, Agatha sat down again, Housewives still playing on the screen, but her attention was scattered. Her fingers itched for something to do, so she picked Sage’s book just to open. Immediately it was too much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She snaps it closed and her are thoughts wandering to Rio again. She caught herself mid thought, hissing under her breath at her own impatience. “Eight hours,” she muttered. “It’s been eight damn hours.” But the weight in her chest felt far heavier than that, as if time itself had stretched into something excruciating. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And so, the cycle continued- pacing, yelling at the TV, not reading Sage’s book, sitting in restless silence. All while the clock ticked endlessly on, mocking her. Waiting for Rio and perhaps Sage was agony.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Two and a half hours later, Agatha stalled mid pace behind the couch in the living room, her breath hitching as she heard the front door creak open. The sound froze her in place. Seeing either of the two women walk through that door would be a relief, but she couldn’t shake the heavy weight in her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had never promised it wasn’t Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The moment felt endless as the door clicked shut. When Rio stepped into the foyer, Agatha’s breath caught in her throat.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Only two things were different from when she last saw her. Rio wore the same outfit as before she left, the same streaks of dirt smudging her legs and hands. But her hair was down, black and long as ever, the sun kissed shorter brown completely gone. Her eyes were sunken, dark circles stark against her tanned skin, and her cheeks were hollow, carved with exhaustion. She looked like a shell of herself, hollow and drained.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s mouth fell open slightly, her heart twisting at the sight. The stark change in Rio’s appearance stunned and wrenched her all at once. Before she could even form the thought, Rio answered the question burning in her mind.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“She’s okay,” Rio said, her voice low, a little scratchy. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words hit Agatha like a wave, and the tension she had been carrying for hours drained from her body. She physically deflated, her shoulders sinking as some of the weight lifted. But the relief was fleeting, eclipsed by the sight of Rio standing there, looking utterly broken.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1">It was fucking heartbreaking.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Without another word, Rio turned and headed to the bedroom. Agatha stood frozen, her eyes following her until she disappeared down the hall. She heard the shower turn on moments later and stayed rooted in place, unsure of what to do. </span> <span class="s2">Did Rio need her space? Did she want to be left alone? </span> <span class="s1">Agatha chose to wait, sitting on the couch with the TV playing softly in the background, her mind focused entirely on the green witch behind that closed door.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When the shower turned off, Agatha strained to listen for Rio’s quiet footsteps moving through her bedroom as she got ready for bed. She was on edge, hoping the sound of the door opening would follow. Then, like the universe had answered her silent prayers, she heard it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio stepped out, her bare feet padding softly down the hall toward the living room. She was dressed in a a silk tank top and matching sleep shorts, her hair still damp. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s mouth waters at the sight. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Folded clothes were neatly tucked in her arms. Her face still looked sunken, her under eyes dark, but there was a slight shift in her energy, a faint crack of light breaking through the heaviness.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tracked Rio’s every move as she came to a stop beside the couch, her presence grounding in its quiet simplicity. Rio looked down at Agatha where she sat, setting the folded pajamas on the cushion beside her, almost like an offering. Then, she extended a hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha looks up at Rio like she’s an angel sent to take her to heaven, and the irony isn’t lost on her. </span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> <em><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br/></span>This was so fucking humiliating. A real knock to the ego.</em><br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha isn’t the one in control here. She isn’t reclaiming her power or standing tall. She’s surrendering everything to Rio. Completely.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The tension in the room wraps around them, thick and intimate, and Agatha is a melting puddle at the center of it. What unsettles her most is how freeing it feels.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Surrendering like this, which has literally never happened in the history of </span> <span class="s2">them</span> <span class="s1">, doesn’t feel like losing. It feels like breathing. Like Agatha’s been deprived of oxygen her entire life and didn’t even realize it until now. Until this moment, in death, with Rio standing before her, she finally feels the air rush in.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha mentally curses herself for always being so damn ironic.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her hand moves on instinct, sliding into Rio’s cold one without hesitation. She’s already halfway there, her body acting before her mind can catch up, her fingers curling into Rio’s the moment they shift downward.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio gives a slight tug to signal Agatha to stand, and Agatha complies without a second thought, rising from the couch with zero hesitation. The moment she stands, Rio’s hand drops away, leaving Agatha nearly whimpering at the loss. Her chin dips instinctively, searching for Rio’s eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Those eyes are hungry and dark, nearly black, dive into her without restraint, like plunging into an endless ocean of blue. A flicker of hazel seeps through, betraying the smallest falter in Rio’s composure, as if the sheer intensity of their gaze had momentarily unsettled her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha realizes that Rio needs this as much, if not more, than she does. This isn’t about power. It’s about Rio regaining a piece of herself. Whatever had shaken her in those hours she was away, this was her way of grounding herself, of proving she hadn’t lost everything she was. She still had control, still had strength, still had Agatha. For once, Agatha wasn’t just willing but eager to let Rio take. To give her the space to rebuild, to feel whole again, even if just for a moment.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, Agatha feels Rio’s hands at her waist, gentle but firm, adjusting her so she stands directly in front of her, no longer slightly adjacent. In one swift motion, Rio untucks Agatha’s blouse from her pants, her fingers brushing the fabric before retreating. Agatha feels the absence acutely, her breath catching in her throat as Rio’s gaze, practically dripping with filth, locks onto her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">All Agatha can do is stand and await further instruction, entirely at Rio’s mercy.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s hands move next, reaching up to begin unbuttoning Agatha’s blouse. Each movement is slow, deliberate, and methodical, her steady hands working with a precision that leaves Agatha speechless. Years of tending gardens, planting, and crafting have paid off. Rio’s hands are one of Agatha’s favorite things about her. They’re always moving, always steady, always purposeful. They itch to create, to touch, just as Agatha’s own hands itch to take, and take, and take some more. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio finishes with the last button, she pushes the blouse off Agatha’s shoulders in one fluid motion, never once touching her skin. The fabric slides down Agatha’s arms and pools at her feet, the ghost of Rio’s presence more unbearable than any contact.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It’s brutal. Agatha feels like she’s practically on the verge of tears from the sheer desperation clawing at her chest. The tension fills the space between them, thick and electric, leaving Agatha completely at Rio’s control.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s gaze immediately locked onto the delicate white lace of the push up bra laid out with her clothes that morning with matching underwear, both carefully chosen. Her hands hovered next, hesitating at the button of Agatha’s pants. Agatha barely noticed the cold, fleeting brush of Rio’s fingers; it was clear she was making an effort not to let their skin meet. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Frustrated by the distance, Agatha tilted her hips forward, silently urging Rio to bridge the gap. But just as Agatha moved, Rio was quicker. Her hand darting back the moment Agatha tried. The button came undone, but the zipper remained untouched, leaving Agatha teetering on the edge of impatience.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Suddenly, Rio speaks, her tone firm yet disarmingly sweet. “Turn around.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitates, but only for a heartbeat. The hesitation isn’t defiance; it’s the reluctance of an addict unwilling to tear her gaze from what she craves most, Rio’s face. The moment passes, and she gives in, letting Rio’s words guide her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">With her back now to Rio, Agatha feels the green witch step closer, their proximity measured yet magnetic. A faint brush of fingers grazes the ends of her hair, a gesture so familiar it sends a shiver through her. It pulls her mind back to that night on the road, to the echo of Rio’s quiet vulnerability after her </span> <span class="s2">‘I have a scar</span> <span class="s1">’ confession.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha inhales sharply, the touch shaking her resolve. She turns her head, trying to catch a glimpse of Rio through her peripheral vision. Their faces hover dangerously close as Rio tilts her chin, ever so slightly, creating a fraction more distance between them while simultaneously giving herself a clearer view of Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">While Agatha fights the desire to let her eyes roll back from the overwhelming sensation, she doesn’t resist the quiet moan that escapes her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, with swift precision, Rio reaches up and moves Agatha’s long brown hair over her shoulder. Not a single finger brushes her skin, the lack of contact calculated and maddening. Agatha’s head turns forward, her eyes closing as she clenches her hands into fists. Every fiber of her aches to take control, to spin around, to crash into Rio and show her just how much she’s missed her. But for now, she holds herself back, trembling on the edge of restraint.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was beginning to drive Agatha insane. Centuries of craving more and more power, desperately pushing to escape.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She feels Rio’s arms slide around her, but they do not pull her close. Instead, they hover just far enough for Agatha to only feel the faint brush of their presence as Rio moves through them. Their bodies remain an inch apart, yet it feels like an infinite distance. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s fingers find the zipper of Agatha’s unbuttoned pants and tug it down slowly, teasingly. Her hands slide into the pockets, her touch achingly close yet infuriatingly distant, as she begins to drag the pants down Agatha’s legs. Once they are low enough, Rio removes her hands, and they fall the rest of the way and pool at Agatha’s ankles.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s shoulders rise and fall with her ragged breathing, trembling on the verge of begging.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Please, my love.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words stay trapped inside her, unwilling to risk shattering the moment. She steps out of her pants carefully, but as she moves back, her body presses flush against Rio’s. The sensation tears a moan from Agatha’s lips, raw and loud, but even her voice cannot drown out the soft, quiet whimper Rio releases at the same time.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her mouth is now so close to Agatha’s ear that if she squeezed her eyes shut tightly enough, she might swear she could feel the faintest ghost of Rio’s lips brushing against the shell of it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s arms twitch as if aching to wrap around Agatha, to pull her closer, to never let her go. But she doesn’t. Instead, her arms slide away and she steps back, withdrawing from Agatha completely. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s head falls forward as she squeezes her eyes even tighter, fighting back the sob clawing its way up her throat. She bites the inside of her cheek, the sting barely enough to anchor her against the aching loss.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her head snaps up suddenly, her eyes wide in surprise as she feels the cold press of Rio’s fingers against her back, deftly working to unclasp her bra. Rio takes another step back, letting Agatha slide the straps down her shoulders and drop it to the floor.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The sound of Rio shifting closer makes Agatha’s ears perk, and she feels the faint trace of a cold finger along the lowest point of her back.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It moves slowly, following the seam of her white lace underwear where it sits snugly on her waist. The touch lingers as Rio traces under the seam of Agatha’s right ass cheek, then her left, dragging out the moment with exquisite precision.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s breathing is labored now, each inhale shuddering. She doesn’t even have the strength to moan; anticipation claws at her so fiercely it might be the death of her, though she is already technically dead.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">If she’s so dead, why can she hear her heartbeat thunder so loudly in her ears, that it threatens to burst her eardrums? The thought flickers and is gone as she loses herself in the intoxicating sensation of Rio’s delicate touches.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then Rio’s finger is pulling away and Agatha hears her take yet another agonizing step back. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This time, the sound that leaves Agatha’s lips is not a whimper. It’s a low, guttural growl. </span>Frustration, unrestrained.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Her impatience begins to rear its ugly head, but before it can consume Agatha, Rio’s voice cuts through the tension.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Take them off.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s hands move instinctively, her fingers already hooking into the waistband of her underwear. She stills as her mind catches up to the moment.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio wanted a show.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha would give her a damn cinematic masterpiece.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha pulls her underwear down her legs as slowly as she had the first time she did this for Rio. She parts her legs slightly, offering Rio the perfect view of what she already knows is coming. When the fabric finally separates from her center, she feels the wetness clinging to her underwear stretch and pull before dripping from her, overwhelming and so wet. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She listens intently, her breaths shallow, desperate to hear Rio’s reaction.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Rio doesn’t moan, groan, or growl. Instead, a whispered, needy </span> <span class="s2">“Yes”</span> <span class="s1"> escapes her lips, filled with quiet excitement at the sight before her.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When her panties pool at her ankles, Agatha doesn’t bother stepping out of them. Instead, she bends down, her left hand bracing against the coffee table. She can feel Rio’s hungry eyes burning into the flesh of her ass, devouring every detail of her display.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Unable to resist, Agatha lets her right hand slip between her legs, seeking the slick heat of her own arousal. The brief contact makes Rio gasp softly, a sound that sends a bolt of satisfaction through Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Stop.” Rio’s voice rings out, echoing through the room. It’s not a request. It’s an order. Agatha’s hand retreats as if burned, obeying the command with the speed of lightning.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Turn around,” Rio continues, her tone leaving no room for argument.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stands upright, stepping out of the mess of lace around her ankles. She turns, her movements deliberate, knowing full well the effect she’s having.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The sight of Rio standing before her is pure, filthy perfection. Her breathing is ragged, her fists clenched so tightly her knuckles are white. Agatha can see the war waging in her- the battle to maintain control, to hold back from taking what Agatha is so readily offering. </span>Heat coils low in Agatha’s core at the sight.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha whispers, her voice trembling with need, “Why are you fighting so hard? I’m here. I’m you—” She stops herself before the word can fully leave her lips. “It’s yours,” she says instead, her voice softer. “Take it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This was about control, wasn’t it? Agatha had given all of it to Rio, <em>so why wouldn’t she just fucking take it?</em></span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><em> <span class="s2">Take me!</span> </em> <span class="s1"> Agatha wants to scream, but she doesn’t. Rio has always been a tease, but this… This is ruthless. Two weeks of sporadic intimate moments, of leaving Agatha crumbling at the seams. Or was it three. Agatha doesn’t know anymore.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The only thing Agatha can focus on is that she’s aching, body and soul, to surrender everything to Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She can see Rio wants it too, so badly she can hardly breathe. Rio had always fallen to her knees for Agatha, worshipping her like royalty, eager and ready to please. But not this time. Suddenly, Rio holds herself back, her arms crossing over her chest like a shield.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha notices the flicker of insecurity cross Rio’s gaze, before her eyes drop to Agatha’s bare chest. The hunger returns, dark and consuming, as Rio’s gaze roams her body.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha understands.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> Rio doesn’t trust her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before she can dwell on the thought, Rio shifts, taking back every ounce of her control. Her crossed arms fall gracefully to her sides, and she straightens, striding forward but leaving that infuriating inch of space between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And just like that, Agatha is a desperate mess again. Her blue eyes are locked on Rio’s lips, craving just a taste. Rio’s hand reaches up, tucking a stray piece of hair behind Agatha’s ear. The touch is so delicate, but Agatha can barely focus, her entire being fixated on Rio’s mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio cups Agatha’s jaw, her fingers sliding into her hair just behind her ear. Her thumb brushes gently across Agatha’s cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Agatha.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It snaps her out of her trance. Her eyes meet Rio’s, and the sound of her name feels eerily reminiscent of that night on the Road, right before Rio had shattered the moment.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s momentary panic is soothed by the firmer hold Rio takes on her face, grounding her. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Kneel,” Rio whispers, pulling her hand away and stepping back just enough to give Agatha room to obey.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio gestures to the floor with a slight nod. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha drops to her knees, her movements fluid as she lands softly on the rug beneath her. A part of her wants to make a joke, to ask Rio ‘are you not entertained?’ by the sight of Agatha on her knees for Death herself. But this isn’t Death. This is Rio. And so, she stays quiet, waiting.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">All she can do is look up at Rio, her heart pounding, anticipation thrumming through her veins.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio reaches for Agatha’s cheek again, her touch steady. For a long moment, they simply look at each other, the weight of their connection heavy in the air.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s thumb swipes across Agatha’s bottom lip. On instinct, Agatha’s mouth parts slightly, eager to take Rio’s finger in. Her eyes never leave Rio’s, filled with longing and hunger.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Rio pulls her hand back before Agatha can act, taking a step away to drink in the sight of Agatha kneeling before her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio looks satisfied.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No,” Agatha whispers, the realization striking her like a bolt of lightning. Rio was about to walk away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And she does.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Once the sound of Rio’s footsteps fades completely, Agatha grabs a throw pillow from the couch and falls forward, burying her face into it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She lets out a muffled yell, her frustration pouring out as she slaps the carpet with an open palm a couple of times. She couldn’t help it. She’d been blue-balled <em>AGAIN </em></span> <span class="s1">and was </span> <span class="s2">extremely</span> <span class="s1"> butthurt about it.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Come to bed, Agatha!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her head snaps up so fast she nearly gives herself whiplash. Just as she’s about to let herself hope, Rio’s voice cuts through again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Get dressed for bed.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha groans, her frustrated yell echoing throughout the room, not even trying to hide it from Rio. She lets her face fall back into the pillow for a moment, muttering incoherently into the fabric. With one final, dramatic slap of her hand against the carpet, she drags herself up. Begrudgingly, she pulls on the t-shirt and pajama shorts Rio had brought to her earlier.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She pouts all the way to Rio’s room, silently hoping they wouldn’t </span> <span class="s2">actually</span> <span class="s1"> be sleeping.<br/></span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For fuck’s sake, they didn’t even need sleep.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When she steps into the bedroom, her eyes land on Rio, sprawled out in the middle of the bed, staring blankly at the ceiling.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s2"><em>Good</em>,</span> <span class="s1"> Agatha thinks, her mood softening ever so slightly. At least she’s not the only one on the brink of combustion from the sheer amount of horniness she’s feeling. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio looks more like herself now. The weight of whatever had happened between them tonight seems to have done its job. Agatha’s frustration subsides just a little at the sight of her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Still, she isn’t letting Rio off the hook entirely.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Instead of climbing into bed like a normal person, Agatha marches up to the bed and and nudges Rio’s shoulder, “Sit up.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio does Agatha plops down, cross legged, where Rio’s head was lying just moments before. She slaps a pillow onto her lap with a little more aggression than necessary. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha cups Rio’s forehead and guides her back, dragging her head down until it lands squarely on the pillow in her lap. She flails slightly at the abruptness of it all but doesn’t resist. </span>
</p><p class="p2"><br/>With a small huff, Agatha grabs the remote off the night stand and unceremoniously dumped it onto Rio’s chest and for her to get the show started.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2">The motion leaves Rio blinking up at her, wide eyed and confused.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha shrugs, </span> <em> <span class="s2">What? I’m not going to do everything.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio blinks the surprise away, fighting the smirk tugging at her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As Rio fumbles with the remote, Agatha reaches down, threading her fingers through Rio’s hair and gently massaged her scalp.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio doesn’t last long. The soothing motion of Agatha’s hands works like magic, and before the first episode finishes, her eyelids grow heavy. She dozes off, her face peaceful as she succumbs to sleep.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha, on the other hand, stays awake the entire night, her hands never leaving Rio’s hair.</span>

<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It took no time at all for them to fall back into their routine after Rio’s return to her realm. The next several days passed in relative calm, their habits like clockwork: tending Nicky’s memorial at dawn, sharing their morning coffee, and then Agatha dragging her chair wherever Rio decided to work in the garden. Sage still hadn’t returned, and while the space she left behind hung heavily over them both, neither brought it up.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha made a point to always face Rio, to choose her. And Rio, silently, let her. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Both acted as if nothing had happened after Rio’s return, as if the charged moments between them hadn’t existed. Rio no longer lingered or teased when Agatha changed. If Rio was there, her gaze remained fixed on anything but Agatha: her sketchbook, the television, even the wall. On some days, she didn’t stay at all, leaving Agatha to dress alone. Still, a change of clothes was always left neatly on the bed for her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Flirting had been sparse, appearing only in fleeting moments. But when it did, it left Agatha’s chest tightening. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">One day in particular that Agatha couldn’t shake the memory of: </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">After Rio had left her to change alone, the clothes set out were a sleeveless black turtleneck and a gray pencil skirt that stopped just above her knees. Agatha took her time getting ready, tying her hair up into a ponytail, with two slightly shorter front strands tucked behind her ears. She forwent the impractical high heels left neatly on the floor, knowing full well how impossible it would be to navigate the cobblestone paths in them while dragging her chair. Still, she carried them, heels dangling from her fingers and her book tucked under her arm as she made her way to the backyard.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">When she arrived, Rio was kneeling in front of an empty bed of soil, her focus entirely on planting seeds. The spot Rio had chosen allowed them to be dangerously close enough for either of them to reach out and make contact. Agatha stood for a moment, watching Rio, before slipping the heels onto her feet with deliberate grace. She caught the way Rio’s eyes flicked to her heels briefly before turning back to her work, her expression unreadable.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Agatha planted herself in her chair with a flourish, crossing her legs and setting the book on the ground beside her. “Any reason I look like the office whore today?” she asked, her tone teasing.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Rio looked up at her face, only her face,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>never letting her gaze linger, and a small smirk tugged at the corner of her lips. “I figured if you’d be here ogling me all day, I might as well enjoy the view,” she said, turning her attention back to the soil.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Agatha raised an eyebrow, her arms crossing over her chest. “You don’t normally?”</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Rio didn’t respond, her focus firmly fixed on the deep hole she was digging with her trowel. The green witch’s silence made Agatha purse her lips in frustration, narrowing her eyes at the other woman.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Fine. Two can play at that game, Agatha thought. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2"><em>Agatha uncrossed her legs, slowly spreading them as wide as her pencil skirt would allow. She thanked whatever god (herself, obviously) had compelled her to skip the underwear Rio had left out for her that morning. “Then by all means,” Agatha said, her voice dripping with smugness</em>.<em>“Enjoy the view.</em>”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Rio’s head snapped up, her line of sight landing exactly where Agatha intended. The reaction was immediate and exactly what she’d been hoping for. Rio froze, clearly stunned by Agatha’s boldness, her gaze wide and unprepared for the sight before her. As she moved to brace her free hand against the ground, she misjudged and plunged her palm directly into the hole she had been digging. The misstep sent her tumbling face first into the dirt, landing with a grunt.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2"><em>Agatha watched as Rio scrambled back to her knees, furiously wiping soil from her face and shirt. She didn’t bother hiding the wicked smile spreading across her lips, her chest swelling with triumph</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">“There’s my girl,” Agatha said, her voice full of satisfaction. She crossed her legs again, lips pursed in smug delight as Rio shot her a glare, still brushing the dirt from her clothes.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Which brings them to today.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They were still in what they had slept in: Agatha in a sweatshirt and sleep shorts, and Rio in a t-shirt and sweats. They sat on the couch, watching mindless TV for the first few hours of the day, a rare moment. Agatha leaned against one arm of the couch, while Rio took the other. Their legs were innocently tangled, a quiet intimacy Agatha dared not disrupt. She stayed perfectly still, savoring every second, knowing Rio would inevitably get up to start her work for the day.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That was until she felt brown eyes burning a hole into the side of her face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha turned her head, her gaze drifting from the TV to meet Rio’s. What she saw made her bite the inside of her cheek, fighting the tug of her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes were dark and hungry, staring into her as if trying to peel back every layer of her soul. The weight of that gaze sent heat rushing through Agatha’s chest, but she quickly turned back to the screen, narrowing her eyes as though the show held all her focus. She worked hard to keep her excitement buried beneath the surface. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Ogling?” Agatha asked, her voice even.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t answer. Instead, she began to shift, untangling her legs from Agatha’s. Agatha’s eyes stayed fixed on the TV, her body tense with anticipation, until-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Holy shit!” she yelped as Rio grabbed her by the ankles and yanked her down the couch with an unwarranted amount of strength. Agatha turned onto her back immediately, propping herself up on her elbows to glare at the green witch and demand an explanation. The question froze on her lips the moment she saw Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There she was, sitting back on her calves, her hands still firmly gripping Agatha’s ankles. The intensity in Rio’s eyes was feral, her focus fixed entirely on Agatha as though she were prey. Agatha’s breath caught in her throat, her words dying before they could take shape. All she could do was hold her breath, watching as Rio began to move.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With deliberate slowness, Rio crawled up Agatha’s body, her movements predatory. On instinct, Agatha leaned back, her elbows giving way as she lowered herself fully onto the couch. Her heartbeat pounded in her ears, her breaths growing ragged, but her gaze stayed locked on Rio’s. She couldn’t think, couldn’t process anything beyond those dark eyes boring into her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio reached her, her weight shifted. She used her knee to nudge Agatha’s legs apart, softly, before planting a thigh in between them. Agatha gasped sharply at the contact, the pressure hitting her exactly where she craved it most. The filthy moan that tore from her lips was involuntary, her head shooting back as her chin bumped against Rio’s with the movement. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The air between them was electric, heavy with tension and desire. Agatha wasn’t sure what would happen next, but she didn’t care. Every fiber of her being was consumed by Rio. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s touch, Rio’s gaze, the way Rio moved with such unrelenting purpose. It left Agatha completely at her mercy, and not for the first time since she’d been in this god forsaken realm, she was more than happy to give in.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio rolled her hips against Agatha’s thigh, which was also situated between her own, it sent a shockwave of pleasure through both of them. Their moans mingled, echoing softly in the charged silence of the room.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s hands shot to Rio’s waist, pulling her down harder to create more friction between them. The pressure was intoxicating, igniting every nerve in her body. When Agatha opened her eyes, she found Rio staring down at her, her dark gaze filled not only with desire but with an aching longing that took Agatha’s breath away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her chest tightened as she curled her fingers into the waistband of Rio’s sweats, her thumbs brushing against the soft skin beneath. Raising her chin slightly, Agatha dared Rio to let her close the space between them, her lips hovering just a whisper away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes flickered to Agatha’s lips, lingering there as if she might give in. For a fleeting moment, it felt like she would. But just as Agatha shifted upward, her fingers grazing the bare skin under Rio’s waistband, Rio tore her gaze away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">In a fluid motion, Rio sat up, her ass pressing firmly against Agatha’s thighs. The unexpected nudge of Rio’s knee against her front sent a jolt through Agatha, pulling a soft, involuntary whimper from her lips. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But slowly, Rio pulled Agatha’s fingers from her waistband and placed them firmly on top of her pants. A silent action: </span> <em> <span class="s2">Not yet.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha gave Rio’s hips a firm squeeze, a quiet signal of understanding: </span> <em> <span class="s2">I hear you.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Taking a hesitant hand, Agatha brought it up to Rio’s cheek, her other hand remaining secure on Rio’s hip. She paused midway, unsure whether Rio would be okay with the touch, and began to pull back. But Rio caught her wrist before it could fall.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without a word, Rio guided Agatha’s hand back to her cheek, pressing it there as if it were exactly where it belonged. Her eyes fluttered closed at the contact.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s breath hitched as she gently pulled Rio back down, their clothed bodies flush against one another. Rio’s face hovered just above hers. One of Rio’s hands braced on the arm of the couch above Agatha’s head, while the other still held Agatha’s wrist, grounding them both.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes remained shut. Agatha’s free hand moved from Rio’s waist to her other cheek, cradling her face with a tenderness that made Rio’s breath catch. “Rio,” she whispered, the name breaking as it left her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes stayed closed, squeezing tighter as though safeguarding the fragile pieces of herself from the intensity of the moment. Agatha’s voice softened further, her thumb brushing lightly across Rio’s cheekbone. “Baby,” she whispered, the endearment melting into the air. “Look at me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It took a moment, but like putty in Agatha’s hands, Rio relented. Slowly, painstakingly, she opened her eyes. Gone was the hunger and desire. There was a quiet ache in her gaze, as though the act itself was almost too much to handle.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s voice was tender, her tone threaded with certainty. “You know,” she began, her lips curling into a gentle smile, “one of these days, you’re going to let me kiss you.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her words weren’t harsh, nor were they taunting. They were a promise, a quiet vow to stay. A reassurance that there was time. That she would wait, however long it took. Agatha would wait. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s gaze faltered for a moment, her grip on Agatha’s wrist tightening as if it were the only thing tethering her to the moment. Her voice came out a shaky whisper, filled with an ache she couldn’t hide, “I’m scared.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I don’t…” She glances to the side, searching for an escape, but Agatha guides her gaze back with a gentle tug. Rio swallows hard, her voice trembling as she continues, “I won’t survive it this time.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her words linger between them for a moment, “I’ve pieced myself back together, over and over,” Rio murmurs. “Each time, with less to rebuild.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her eyes shimmered with unshed tears, and Rio hesitates, her voice exposed like a wound. “You’ll destroy me, Agatha,” she whispers, the words barely audible and laced full with centuries of heartbreak and sorrow. “And I’m not sure there’s enough of me left to risk.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I know,” Agatha said softly, her voice trembling, unsteady. “I know what I’ve done to you, what I’ve taken from you.” Her blue eyes glimmered, not with tears but with a profound heaviness of regret. She swallowed hard, the words catching in her throat.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha wasn’t ready to apologize yet. The words sat on the tip of her tongue, but she couldn’t force them out, not when she hadn’t fully forgiven Rio. <em>Not yet.</em> To be honest, she hadn’t even forgiven herself… But she was trying, and that was more than she’d done in the last two hundred and some years.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2"><em>Baby steps</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That’s all either of them could manage with a past as heavy and tainted as theirs. And for now, trying was enough. It had to be.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">So, with a steady breath and all the strength Agatha could muster, she forced out the words, “You didn’t deserve any of it. Not then. Not ever.” Her blue eyes searched Rio’s, desperate, pleading, as though willing her to see the truth in every word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t an apology. It wasn’t forgiveness. It was an admission, a moment of genuine honesty that broke through the walls she’d spent centuries building. It was Agatha’s way of taking accountability for the part she’d played in this tangled, fractured history of <em>them</em>. And that was a huge step, maybe even a monumental one. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They still had work to do, together and alone, but it was a start. And for someone like Agatha, this felt like moving mountains.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes widened slightly, the weight of Agatha’s words sinking in, their impact unmistakable. She didn’t respond with words, but her actions spoke volumes. Rio shifted her weight, moving the thigh that had been nestled between Agatha’s and planted it on the other side of her. Her knees now framed Agatha, and with deliberate care, her hands reached to gently remove Agatha’s from where they still rested firmly on her cheeks.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sitting upright, Rio hovered for a moment, her gaze fixed on Agatha. Then, with a fluid motion, her hand found the collar of Agatha’s sweatshirt. She tugged firmly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"><br/><br/></span>Instinct took over and Agatha flung herself forward to meet her without hesitation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her hands landed directly on Rio’s hips, gripping tightly to anchor herself. Their faces hovered inches apart, close enough for Agatha to feel the heat radiating between them. Rio’s forehead dropped softly against Agatha’s, their breaths tangling in the small space that separated them. Both of their eyes locked on their target, their breathing uneven, mouths slightly parted in anticipation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio nudged her nose against Agatha’s, a wordless invitation to tilt her head up, to meet her. Agatha obeyed, her breath catching as their lips brushed. It was so faint, yet enough to send a spark coursing through her. The touch was hesitant, both of them holding back, just as if the moment was too fragile to risk breaking.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This wasn’t just about want. It wasn’t the hunger that had consumed them in the past. This was different, something deeper, something that carried the significance of their history, their pain, their grief, their longing. For once, it wasn’t about losing themselves in each other. It was about discovery, about finding what they had spent centuries searching for but could never name.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The hand that held Agatha’s shirt slid upward, brushing along her neck before settling at its base. Rio’s fingers threaded tenderly through Agatha’s hair, the touch sending a shiver down her spine. Agatha’s arms wrapped tightly around Rio’s lower back, pulling her impossibly closer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With a slight tug of Agatha’s hair, their lips met. A quiet whimper escaped Rio at the contact, sweet and unguarded. The kiss was sickeningly sweet, unhurried, their lips barely moving. Agatha surrendered completely, letting Rio take the lead, not out of fear of scaring her off, but because she simply didn’t have the strength to do anything else.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her entire life had been spent in control, every move calculated, every plan thought out to perfection. But now, she was exhausted, and for a change, she let go. Rio was willing to bear the weight, and Agatha allowed herself to rest in that.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s fingers tightened slightly in Agatha’s hair, her other hand sliding to rest against the curve of her jaw. The kiss deepened, slow and intentional, and they were savoring every second of it. Agatha felt herself melting further into Rio’s touch, her fingers pressing into Rio’s lower back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio tilted her head, angling the kiss as her lips parted by a hair. Naturally, Agatha followed, her breath catching as she felt the soft, teasing brush of Rio’s tongue against her bottom lip. She accepted immediately, opening her mouth to invite Rio in. The contact sent a wave of warmth crashing through her, and they both moaned loudly this time, the sound echoing between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s hands curled tighter into the fabric of Rio’s shirt, steadying herself as the kiss deepened. At first, it was tentative, exploratory, as though Rio was taking her time to relearn the terrain, to savor every new sensation. But soon, her movements grew bolder, her tongue tracing over Agatha’s with deliberate precision, coaxing a quiet, shuddering whine from deep in Agatha’s throat.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The kiss grew hotter, more desperate, yet still carried the same sore tenderness that rooted them to this frail vulnerability. Rio’s teeth grazed Agatha’s bottom lip, tugging gently before deepening the kiss again, her tongue stroking with an intensity that left Agatha weak. Agatha’s hands slid up Rio’s back, gripping her shoulders afraid to let go, while her entire body leaned into the sensation, into Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The world outside didn’t exist. There was only this. Only the warmth of Rio’s touch, the taste of her, and the steady rhythm of their breaths and tongues mingling. Agatha had spent centuries taking power and control, but now, she gave herself over entirely, letting Rio set the pace, letting Rio guide her. And with every press of their lips, every exploratory touch of their tongues, every quiet whimper exchanged, Agatha felt like she was breathing. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t something that would devour her completely, that would lead to her end. No, this wasn’t the kiss of Death. It felt as if Death herself was teaching Agatha how to breathe. It wasn’t suffocating or overwhelming. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For the second time since she had been here, she felt a force of air filling her lungs. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha had spent so long forgetting what it meant to truly feel alive, and now, in her own death and in the hands of Death herself, she was learning to do just that.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then Rio begins to pull away, but Agatha instinctively chases after her lips. Rio lets her, meeting her with soft, fleeting pecks, never allowing the kiss to deepen. Somehow, it felt just as important, just as grounding. Agatha’s brows knit together in frustration, her need to keep Rio close simmering under her skin. Rio breathes out a quiet chuckle, her lips curling into a small, amused smile at Agatha’s unwillingness to let her go.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio finally pulls back just enough to be out of reach, her warm breath still brushing against Agatha’s face. Those brown eyes flicker to the window for a brief moment before returning to Agatha, a subtle shift in her expression.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What’s wrong?” Agatha blurts out, the words tumbling from her lips as she fights to suppress the pang of panic building in her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio leans in, giving Agatha a single, reassuring kiss, one that tames her swirling fears instantly. And it worked. She pulls back, her voice calm, “Sage is home.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh,” Agatha breathes out, her shoulders relaxing as some of the tension melts away. She wasn’t disappointed, nor was she angry that Sage’s return seemed to pause what had just started, halting what might have gone further.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">No, if she were being honest with herself, there was more relief than anything else.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Still, mixed with that relief was a faint spark of excitement, quickly tempered by the familiar hesitancy that always accompanied thoughts of the girl. Agatha couldn’t deny it, she was still scared. Scared to grow close, scared of the guilt that would inevitably follow. It was safer to keep her distance, to protect herself from feelings she wasn’t sure she deserved to feel. Yet here Sage was, back home, and the gravity of that truth settled heavily in Agatha’s chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With a parting kiss, Rio began to move off of Agatha, her legs staggering as she stood. “I’m gonna go-” she started, stopping mid sentence as she caught herself on her feet. Her gaze dropped back to Agatha briefly before she thumbed over her shoulder toward the front door. The unspoken message was clear.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha nodded, understanding. Rio missed their daughter. The barely contained excitement in her eyes made it clear she couldn’t simply wait for Sage to walk through the door.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without another word, Rio turned and left, the soft click of the front door lingering behind her. Agatha stood, her legs stiff, and made her way to the living room window, her fingers brushing the curtain aside to watch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There she was. <em>Sage</em>. A black backpack slung over her shoulder, strolling down the dirt pathway that wound from the forest clearing. A few feet ahead of her, Brucie slithered quickly, cutting a determined path toward the house. Agatha’s breath caught for a moment as her gaze rested on Sage’s face. That smile. Wide, unrestrained, and unmistakably hers.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><em> <span class="s2">Beautiful, </span> </em> <span class="s1">Agatha thought, her chest tightening. She thanked herself for that, of course. Sage’s striking looks were a mirror of her own, an undeniable legacy carried forward.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then her focus shifted to Rio, already moving toward Sage with a light jog, her hair catching the sunlight. As Brucie crossed paths with Rio, the snake made a sharp, sudden jerk, to snap at her with a hiss.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio flinched, startled by Brucie’s sudden movement, her reflexes kicking in as she stumbled slightly to the side. Her hand shot out instinctively, though she didn’t lose her footing. Agatha caught the brief flash of alarm on Rio’s face, followed by a glare and an exasperated huff as she regained her stride. A faint smirk tugged at Agatha’s lips, those two probably liked each other more than either of them were willing to admit. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio reached Sage, her arms opened wide, and they met in a delicate embrace. Sage’s chin came to rest atop Rio’s shoulder as Rio held her close. For a moment, the world seemed to pause.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha watched as Sage’s green eyes squinted against the sunlight, which now appeared impossibly brighter. The realm itself seemed to shift, as though it recognized and celebrated the life Sage breathed into it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, with a tenderness that seemed to echo the sunlit moment, Rio pressed a soft kiss into Sage’s hair, her arms holding her daughter just a little tighter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t tear her eyes away. She knew she had no claim to this, no right to step into the space they had carved out for themselves. And yet, she couldn’t help but feel the sharp sting of envy threading through her, but it wasn’t jealousy. It was so desperately wanting to be a part of it, to feel like she belonged in this picture instead of an observer hovering just outside its frame.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She turned away from the window, shielding herself from the image as if that would stop the strange ache growing inside her. What right did she have to feel this way? To crave connection with a girl she barely knew but who somehow carried pieces of her heart? </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before she could dwell on her thoughts any longer, the sound of the front door opening and shutting snapped her attention back. She heard the heavy thunk of a backpack being dropped by the door, then the quick, familiar rhythm of footsteps echoing through the foyer. Agatha froze, watching as Sage darted past and started heading up the stairs. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The word left her mouth without thought. “Hey!” Agatha shouted.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage stopped dead in her tracks on the third step, her back going rigid. Slowly, she turned to face Agatha, her green eyes wide with a mix of emotions- surprise, maybe fear, like she had been caught doing something wrong. Or perhaps she was just shocked that Agatha was addressing her at all, unprompted.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They stared at each other for a long moment, the air thick with an awkward tension. Agatha hadn’t thought this far ahead. She didn’t know why she’d stopped her, much less what she was going to say next. She scrambled for something, anything, to fill the silence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You… um…” Agatha cleared her throat, her fingers twitching at her sides. “Want to get your ass beat at chess?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage froze for a moment before her expression softened. She fought the tug of a smile, feigning indifference with an impressive effort. Still, the gleam in her green eyes gave her away. She nodded subtly, her stance relaxing just a little.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha gave a small nod in return, her expression unwavering despite the quiet relief swelling within in her. “I’ll be on the patio,” she said, her voice still firm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As Agatha turned to leave, the thought crept into her mind unwelcome. She hadn’t beaten Sage at a game since she’d learned the young woman was allegedly a damn chess prodigy. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a loud irritated groan. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha changed into her clothes for the day and made her way to the patio, where the sun hung high in the sky, casting warm light over the space. She moved with quiet focus, setting up the chessboard. Not long after, Rio appeared, setting a cup of coffee down on the table beside her. There was a small, affectionate smile on Rio’s lips, one that Agatha caught but didn’t comment on. Maybe it was from the memory of their kiss earlier that morning, still hovering between them, or perhaps it was the quiet fondness of seeing Agatha here, waiting for Sage. Maybe both. Either way, the moment passed without a word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was out in the garden, doing god knows what, while Sage and Agatha had settled on the patio, their chess game unfolding. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Two games passed in silence. Agatha’s hands twitched restlessly, her fingers brushing the edge of the chessboard as she struggled to summon the courage to start a conversation. She wanted to know the young woman sitting across from her, but her own emotions clawed at her determination. Her thumb nail finds its way to her mouth, biting and ripping. Guilt pressed heavy in her chest, longing twisted uncomfortably in her stomach, and frustration pulsed like a constant drumbeat in her mind. It was an endless war within herself. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She was growing impatient with her inability to break through. When the girl had brought her in to this place, she had been relentless. Pushing and prodding at every wall Agatha put up, stubborn to get Agatha to simply acknowledge her. Back then, the silence had been a gift.</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br/><br/></span>During their very first game of chess all those weeks ago, Agatha had welcomed the quiet. It was a temporary relief from the chaos of being thrust into a dauntingly unfamiliar situation.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But now, the silence felt different. It wasn’t suffocating, but it wasn’t comforting either. Sage had been gone for weeks, and during that time, Agatha had worried in a way only a mother could. She’d spent hours imagining this moment, sitting across from her, trying to connect. Yet now that they were here, Sage was still holding back, treading lightly, afraid of pushing too hard and scaring Agatha off. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was infuriating. But also… sweet? Agatha couldn’t deny the effort Sage was making. The delicate balancing act, the unspoken promise to just </span> <span class="s2">be</span> <span class="s1"> here with her, no expectations, no demands. It was infuriating, and it was endearing, and it was so, so frustratingly strange.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tried to focus on the game, on the pieces in front of her. The familiar sequence of planning her moves, of watching Sage’s quiet precision, it gave her restless hands something to do. It settled her nerves, even if only slightly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As Sage pretended to deliberate her next move, Agatha knew better. The girl already had it figured out, every step always planned in advance. Agatha let her gaze drift to the garden. There, by the pond, Rio stood feeding the koi, her small smile unwavering since she’d stepped out onto the patio. The memory of their kiss lingered in Agatha’s mind, extremely vivid, a distraction she welcomed with open arms.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Unconsciously, a smile tugged at Agatha’s lips as her thumb grazed her bottom lip. She could still feel Rio’s lips, as they were branded there. She was completely lost in the memory, unaware of the way it softened her features.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Uh… what are you doing?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s voice snapped her out of her pleasant trance so abruptly that Agatha flinched, her head jerking toward the girl. She blinked, disoriented and defensive, feeling like she’d just been caught red handed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What?” she demanded, her tone sharper than intended. She shifted in her chair, crossing her arms tightly over her chest. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“That,” Sage said, pointing at her with an accusatory finger. “What’s wrong with your face?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“My face?” Agatha repeated, instantly on edge. She touched her chin self consciously, wiping at it thinking something might actually be there. “What do you mean? Use your words.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage tilted her head, clearly enjoying the other woman’s discomfort. There was a teasing glint in her eyes as she stalled, dragging the moment out just a little longer. Finally, she said, “You’re… smiling. It’s weird.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha scoffed, sinking further into her chair as though the accusation was completely preposterous, “Wha- no, I’m not.” She huffed, waving Sage off with a dismissive flick of her hand. “Don’t be ridiculous.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But the way Sage’s gaze narrowed, shifting her head to where Agatha had been staring moments before, made her stomach twist. Agatha could already guess where those damn green eyes had landed. Of course, Rio. Standing by the pond, her small smile still in place, completely oblivious to the havoc she was unintentionally reeking on the patio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When Sage turned back, her expression was</span> <span class="s1"> knowing. Her eyebrows lifted, her eyes slightly wide with realization, and her lips pressed together tightly, Agatha knew she was physically restraining whatever smug remarks were threatening to spill out.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha caught the look and stiffened. She wasn’t about to give Sage the satisfaction of saying </span> <span class="s2">anything</span><span class="s1">. To cut her off (clearly, for Sage’s sake, not her own) Agatha changed the subject.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What were you doing while you were gone?” she asked abruptly. The words came out harsher than she intended, more of an accusation than a genuine question. It wasn’t mean, but it was pointed enough to serve its purpose: a diversion from whatever was about to come toppling of out of Sage’s mouth. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It worked. For the first time since meeting Sage, the girl was completely caught off guard, a misstep. One Agatha was seriously grateful for. The question had evidently been unexpected, a rare crack in Sage’s otherwise unshakable composure.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha watched as Sage straightened her posture, holding herself a little taller. And for whatever reason, it felt like she was looking into a mirror. How had this girl, who had grown up without her, managed to embody so much of her? It was uncanny, the way Sage exuded Agatha’s own mannerisms, so much so that it felt oddly rewarding. But she didn’t let the thought rattle her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s green eyes flicked briefly to the side and back to Agatha, perhaps a subtle tell that suggested she was hiding something. But just as quickly as the slip appeared, it vanished, her expression neutral once more.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sneak into college lectures,” Sage said, her voice even, though a faint smirk tugged at her lips. “Amongst… other things.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Other things?” Agatha echoed, her brow lifting in suspicion.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage’s smirk grew, tongue pressing into her cheek, as she leaned back in her chair. </span> <em> <span class="s2">Just as fucking infuriating as Rio</span> </em> <span class="s1"><em>,</em> Agatha thought. Sage’s tone turning deliberately nonchalant, “Well, you know, normal things. What any ‘college aged person’ would do.” She raised her hands, making exaggerated air quotes around “college aged person,” before continuing. “Parties, recreational drugs-”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“DRUGS?”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>Agatha’s interruption was immediate, her voice booming.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Sage didn’t even flinch. Her voice cut smoothly through Agatha’s outrage, “Sex-”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Absolutely not! Nope! Don’t need to hear literally any more of that,” Agatha blurted out, throwing her hands up to ward off the words themselves. She might be dead, but she swore she could feel her blood pressure spike to previously uncharted heights. They were </span> <span class="s2">not</span> <span class="s1"> that kind of famil-. Agatha couldn’t even finish the thought in her head. She promptly squashed it and dragged her focus back to safer ground. “So… lectures. What kind?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Anything. Everything,” Sage answered with a casual shrug.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Well, do you have a favorite?” Agatha asked, her tone purposefully mocking, as if the question were the most obvious thing in the world and Sage had taken far too long to answer it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The question made Sage pause for a moment, considering it more seriously than Agatha had expected. Her smirk faded, replaced by a thoughtful expression. “No,” Sage admitted finally. “I mean, I don’t think so. I love all of it. Learning about anything and everything, not just from a book or my-” Sage’s words faltered, her gaze flicking uncertainly to Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha nodded, her chest tightening but still, she encouraged her to continue.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“…or my mom,” Sage finished, her voice softer now.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The vulnerability in the single word hung in the air, quiet but powerful. Agatha swallowed hard, her throat tightening against the rush of emotions that followed. She didn’t respond right away, too caught in the gravity of that word. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage immediately goes to move a chess piece, not even looking at the board and definitely not at Agatha. They both needed a distraction and to keep her thoughts from stirring too loud, Agatha speaks the quote from memory:</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>“To stand at the edge of the sea, to sense the ebb and flow of the tides, to feel the breath of a mist moving over a great salt marsh, is to have knowledge of things that are as nearly eternal as any earthly life can be.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage freezes, her brows furrowing in recognition. Instead of her familiar smirk, a genuine smile spreads across her face. There’s something in her expression, maybe admiration, that catches Agatha off guard.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You read <em>Under the Sea-Wind?”</em></span> <span class="s1"> Sage asks, her tone warm, hopeful curiosity shining in her green eyes. “Did you read my notes?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Why do you sound surprised?” She shoots back, arching a brow. “Do I strike you as illiterate?” Agatha gives a casual shrug, leaning back in her chair. “I had time while you were off gallivanting. The book was sitting there on the damn shelf, practically begging to be opened. And, well, your notes were impossible to ignore. You annotate like you’re being graded.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage’s smile brightens, practically glowing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></span> <span class="s2"><em>The sun is too goddamn bright today</em>, </span> <span class="s1">Agatha thinks, knowing all too well it had everything to do with the girl sitting across from her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> “Don’t act like you didn’t enjoy it. If anything, I probably helped you understand Carson better.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“If anything, your notes made me want to argue with the book just to spite you,” Agatha retorts, a sly edge to her tone. “Maybe I just want a real challenge?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“And you thought quoting one of my favorite books would trip me up?” Sage asks, her voice playful. “Bold move, Harkness.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Guilty,” Agatha replies smoothly. “I figured if I can’t beat you at chess, I could at least out debate you on your own turf.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage rolls her eyes, but there’s warmth in the gesture. “So? What’s your take?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>“She makes it sound like standing by the sea suddenly makes you wise, like watching the tide come in gives you some profound understanding of the universe. I don’t buy it.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage raises an eyebrow, leaning forward, her elbows resting on the table. “It’s not about becoming wise. It’s about feeling connected. The tides, the mist, the salt marsh… They remind you there’s something bigger than yourself, something that keeps moving even when you don’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“Convenient,” Agatha shoots back, her tone dry. “That’s a neat way to tie a bow on something infinite and unknowable. But Carson’s wrong if she thinks the sea is anything like eternity. It’s unpredictable. Brutal. All storms and riptides and undertows. No permanence, just destruction.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage shrugs, unbothered by Agatha’s harshness. “And yet it always comes back. The tide rises, the marsh breathes, the waves keep crashing. Sure, the storms are chaotic, but even chaos has a rhythm. You can’t call it destruction just because it changes.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffs, rolling her eyes. “Rhythm? So getting dragged out to sea is just a part of the rhythm now? Let me guess, you’re going to tell me drowning is poetic too.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage leans back in her chair, shaking her head like Agatha just doesn’t get it. “You’re focusing on the surface,” she says, her tone patient. “Carson wasn’t talking about what the sea destroys. She was talking about what it reveals. It’s not about what gets taken. It’s about what’s left behind.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes, and says “And what’s left behind, Sage? Salt and bones? The sea doesn’t leave anything, it erodes. It devours. What’s so profound about that?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage doesn’t flinch, her green eyes steady. “It doesn’t devour. It transforms. Erosion isn’t just loss. It’s change. The sea reshapes everything it touches. It makes room for what’s next.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s easy to say when you’ve never felt it pull you under,” Agatha mutters, her voice quiet. “The sea isn’t profound when it’s swallowing you whole.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage tilts her head, her expression softening, her tone fills with somber admiration. “And yet you’re still here, aren’t you? You’ve been pulled under more times than I can imagine, but you’ve always found a way back to the shore.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stiffens at that, her arms falling to her sides as her fingers tap lightly against the chessboard. “You’ve got a lot of opinions for someone who’s spent her whole life being sheltered. You haven’t seen how much the sea can take.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, you’re awfully cynical for someone who can’t seem to let go of it,” Still, Sage doesn’t flinch. She persists, “And maybe I have been sheltered. But I’ve seen enough to know the sea doesn’t just take. It gives back. It doesn’t destroy for the sake of destruction, it clears the way. It moves forward.”</p><p> </p><p> “So, what? You think the sea’s some wise old mentor? A little rough around the edges, but ultimately trying to teach us something?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage chuckles softly, “Not quite. I think it’s more like a mirror. It doesn’t teach, it reflects. You see in it what you’re ready to see. Some people see chaos. Some see balance. And some… see themselves.” She pauses, her voice softening. “What do you see?”</p><p><br/><br/>The significance of her question lingers between them, and for a brief moment, neither of them speaks. It’s obvious they aren’t really talking about the sea anymore, but neither one is willing to acknowledge it. Instead, they both cling to the pretense, choosing to remain willfully oblivious, as though naming the true subject of their conversation would expose something too delicate to confront.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha falls silent, her gaze drifting to the garden where Rio trims a bush that Agatha doesn’t know the name of. “I see a lot of questions I don’t want to answer,” she mutters. Agatha’s lips twitch, though she doesn’t fully smile. She flicks her fingers at the chessboard. “Your move, philosopher.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage doesn’t push that matter. She grins, the tension finally giving way to something lighter. “Brace yourself, Harkness. This is going to hurt.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha loses again. Of course, she fucking loses. Rio had somehow managed to create an evil genius in the form of Sage, a young woman who was as stubborn as the day was long and seemingly incapable of losing. Somehow, despite everything, she was exactly like Agatha. It was infuriating. Agatha had always prided herself on her quick wit and ability to outmaneuver anyone, but Sage? Sage didn’t just meet her blow for blow; she dismantled her strategies with a maddening precision that felt eerily familiar.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She didn’t just challenge Agatha’s intellect; she forced her to step up her game entirely. There was no room for shortcuts or assumptions when it came to Sage. Every move had to be calculated, every word carefully considered, because Sage would pounce on any opening with a smile and a ruthlessness that Agatha couldn’t help but begrudgingly admire.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had kept to herself in the garden all day, and Agatha had a sneaking suspicion as to why. Rio’s silence had its own language, she was letting Agatha have time with Sage. They were left undisturbed as the hours passed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">By the time they reached their fourth game, the sun had begun to set, still impossibly bright in the sky, bathing the patio in golden light. It was Sage who spoke, her voice softer than usual as she confessed, “I’ve never actually been to the ocean.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha blinked at her, her brow furrowing. “Are you </span> <span class="s2">fucking</span> <span class="s1"> kidding me?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For the last who knows how long, they’d done nothing but talk about the sea, moving seamlessly from poetry and metaphors to facts and trivia. Sage was obsessed with the ocean, a fixation that had taken Agatha by surprise. Knowing her mother, Agatha would’ve bet their conversations would’ve revolved around botany. Sage was half green witch, after all, and while she loved plants, they didn’t hold her in the same fascination as the sea. The ocean, vast and unknowable, had a pull on her that even Rio’s carefully tended ginormous garden couldn’t compete with, much to Rio’s playful dismay.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Why?” It seemed ridiculous. Sage had almost a year of freedom on the surface, and she hadn’t bothered to visit even one of the world’s coastlines which, as Sage evidently knew, stretched 221,000 miles (or, if you wanted to know in kilometers, 356,000.)</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She’d had the chance to stand on any beach, to feel the salt wind on her face. And yet… <em>nothing</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage must’ve caught the disbelief on Agatha’s face because she offered a small, lopsided smile, one that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I’ve read about it. Watched footage. Dreamed about it since I was little. But actually seeing it? I don’t know… it felt too big. Like it would swallow me whole if I wasn’t ready.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze softened, “Too big?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage nodded, glancing down at the chessboard as if it could spare her from Agatha’s scrutiny. “I mean, everything I’ve read about it… It’s endless. It holds everything, right? Life, death, balance. It’s… </span> <span class="s2">everything.</span> <span class="s1"> And I guess I wasn’t ready to stand in front of all that. To feel small.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a low hum, her lips twitching as if considering a smile but not quite committing to it. “You’re a lot like her, you know.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s head shot up, green eyes wide with curiosity. “Like who?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Your mother.” Agatha gestured vaguely toward the garden, where she could just make out Rio’s figure somewhere near the willow tree. “You’re both a little afraid of being swallowed whole. Though I doubt either of you would ever admit it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha knew damn well she wasn’t referring to Rio, but she wasn’t willing to admit that out loud just yet. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage frowned, “I’m not afraid,” she said, her voice carrying a thread of defensiveness.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha arched a brow, her smirk finally breaking through. “Aren’t you? You’ve spent your whole life with your nose in books and your eyes on screens, dreaming about the sea but never stepping foot near it. That’s fear, kid. Plain and simple.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s lips pressed into a thin line, her gaze dropping back to the chessboard. “It’s not fear,” she whispered, almost to herself. “It’s… respect.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">That caught Agatha off guard, her smirk faltering</span> <span class="s1">. “Respect?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“The ocean isn’t just a thing you look at,” Sage explained, her voice quiet but firm. “It’s alive. It’s not just water. It’s everything. You don’t just go to it lightly, you know? You have to </span> <span class="s2">be ready.</span> <span class="s1">” </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Oh Jesus fucking Christ, more metaphors.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha wanted to stop talking about fucking metaphors. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As if Sage could hear her thoughts, she shifted gears abruptly. “You know it’s my birthday in a couple weeks?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She did. Rio had mentioned it in passing, and Agatha had thrown out a dry comment about how Sage being a Scorpio explained a lot. But Sage wasn’t done. “I want to see it. The ocean. I think I want to go whale watching. If you’re okay with it, maybe we can all go?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Leave Rio’s realm? The idea gave Agatha a reaction that, if she were honest, surprised even her. She’d grown comfortable here, and the thought of the world above felt overwhelming. Too big. Too much. Would she still have this body, this form, or would she be the ghost she was before?<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The guilt gnawed at her too. Doing something as a family without him, it didn’t feel right. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She pushed the thoughts aside, her voice impartial as she replied, “We’ll see.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That simple response made Sage’s face light up like a Christmas tree. It wasn’t an outright no from Agatha Harkness, and for Sage, that was enough.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Checkmate,” Agatha said, her tone casual.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Fuck,” Sage muttered under her breath.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha pretended not to notice that Sage had let her win.</span>

<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The weeks leading up to Sage’s birthday. Had been interesting to say the least, everyday different than the last. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio and Agatha were in the garden, and Rio was droning on about the delicate art of planting azaleas. She spoke with the kind of enthusiasm that only Rio could muster, her hands moving expertly through the soil as she explained every step. Agatha, crouched awkwardly nearby, had no idea why she’d agreed to this. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Well, she </span> <span class="s2">did</span> <span class="s1"> know, but she wasn’t about to admit that to herself, much less to Rio.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It definitely wasn’t because of the kiss they’d shared a few days ago. No, the two of them hadn’t been acting like lovesick fools since then, stealing glances, brushing hands, sharing secret smiles like they were caught in some ridiculous romantic comedy.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> <em>Of course not. </em> </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t even begin to unpack the flower situation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It began with an aster. “For patience,” Rio had said with a knowing smile as she set it on the table. Agatha had scoffed, muttered something sarcastic, but kept it anyway. The next day it was a camellia. “For courage.” By the third day, Agatha had stopped pretending to be annoyed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Now every morning, Rio brought a new flower, each a different meaning. Agatha grumbled and teased, but the growing collection on her windowsill told a different story.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She was being wooed and she would never admit it, but it was working. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She glanced over at the guest bedroom window overlooking the garden, where she had been staying. A room that had mysteriously appeared across from Rio’s after Sage’s return. And no, it wasn’t because Rio had banished her there after some emotionally charged argument. The decision had been entirely Agatha’s. She didn’t trust herself not to act like a reckless hormonal teenager chasing after a crush, or worse, to sabotage the fragile progress she’d made with both Rio and Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Agatha brought it up that night after Sage came home, she couldn’t stomach the sad look in Rio’s eyes. Rio thought she’d done something wrong. But Agatha quickly explained herself, and that sadness shifted into a quiet understanding.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha had spent so long running, so long alone, that she didn’t know how to just </span> <span class="s2">be</span> <span class="s1">. To live without chasing chaos, without creating it, without letting it consume her. She’d never stayed still for this long (excluding that one scarlet colored incident when her mind hadn’t exactly been her own for three years). And this calm, this steadiness… it was strange. New. Begrudgingly nice, even.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Which is why she found herself kneeling in the dirt next to Rio, discussing the finer points of planting a flower, all in an effort to woo her back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tried to follow her movements but found herself more focused on the way Rio’s lips pressed together in concentration.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re staring,” Rio stated calmly, her focus never leaving the azalea she was carefully planting.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No, I’m not,” Agatha shot back, a little too quickly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio turned her head away from the plant, her hands pausing in the soil. Her eyes traced Agatha slowly, moving from head to knees before traveling back up to meet her gaze. The faintest smirk tugged at her lips as she gave a small nod and said, “Okay.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio went back to tending the azalea, her hands moving, methodically, as if nothing had just happened. Agatha, on the other hand, felt like she was about to burst. She watched Rio’s calm focus, the way her fingers brushed the soil, the way her hair caught the light, and she felt a groan building in her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She was tired of Rio making it look so </span> <span class="s2">damn</span> <span class="s1"> easy to act like nothing was happening between them.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“And if I </span> <span class="s2">am</span> <span class="s1"> staring?” Agatha said suddenly.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio paused, her hands stilling as she glanced up at Agatha, one brow arched in mild amusement. “Then I’d say you’re distracting me,” she said simply, maddeningly so.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1">Goddammit.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t stop herself from rolling her eyes. What were they? Children? She didn’t need to say it out loud. The context was painfully obvious. In what world would Agatha Harkness, of all people, be kneeling in the dirt learning how to plant a flower?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Something on your mind?” Rio’s voice broke through her thoughts, stoic as always. She wasn’t looking at Agatha, her attention fixed on the azalea.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha grabbed the trowel beside her and began digging a hole, her movements more aggressive than necessary. “Nope,” she said curtly, not bothering to hide the edge in her voice.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This made Rio finally pause and look up, her brows furrowing slightly as she sat back on her heels. Her brown eyes widened just enough to show her confusion as she watched Agatha practically attack the soil. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You sure?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stopped digging, her chest tightening as she glanced at Rio. “What do you want me to say, Rio?” she snapped.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The tension in the air thickened as she stilled, mimicking Rio’s movements and sitting back on her heels. Her fingers gripped the trowel tightly, her knuckles whitening as she struggled to contain the frustration boiling under her skin.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t flinch at the outburst. Instead, she calmly brushed her hands off, crossing her arms over her chest as she held Agatha’s gaze. “Whatever it is you’re trying so hard not to,” she said softly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha clenched her jaw, her fingers tightening even more around the trowel as she tried to come up with a response that wouldn’t betray the storm brewing inside her. Rio’s steady gaze wasn’t helping, it never did. That calm, unshakable presence was maddening, especially when Agatha felt anything but calm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I asked you to teach me how to plant a flower,” Agatha said finally, her voice quieter, strained. “That’s it. Nothing more.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Whatever you say, Agatha.” The disappointment in Rio’s voice was subtle, but it still made Agatha’s stomach twist. Rio picked up her trowel, stabbing the soil in frustration, mirroring the aggression Agatha had shown just moments ago. “I’m not the one sitting here throwing a temper tantrum over a word,” she mumbled. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m not throwing a tantrum!” Agatha’s voice came out louder than she intended, almost a shout. She clenched her jaw, her frustration overtaking her. </span> <span class="s2">Why couldn’t Rio just say it? </span> <span class="s1">Agatha had been the one to ask for this, hadn’t she?</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t like Rio to hold back. Calling things for what they were was practically her defining trait, especially when Agatha couldn’t. Why wasn’t she doing it now? Why was she letting this tension linger, letting Agatha twist herself in knots pretending this was just about planting a flower?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re not exactly subtle, Agatha.” Rio was sat back on her heels again, eyes boring in to Agatha. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She hated how exposed she felt under Rio’s steady gaze, like the woman could see right through her carefully constructed walls.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Agatha said finally, her voice quieter, less defensive.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio set her trowel down, a small smile tugging at the corners of her lips. “You, Agatha Harkness,” she said, her voice soft with amusement, “asked me, Rio Vidal, on a date. And now you’re sitting here acting like it’s not because you’re too scared to admit it out loud.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha blinked, her cheeks flushing as her grip on the trowel faltered. “I’m not scared,” she shot back quickly, though her voice lacked its edge.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio tilted her head slightly, “Then say it,” she said gently. “I mean, I’m not exactly running away, am I?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha opened her mouth to say it, to call it what it was, but the words caught in her throat. She clenched the trowel in her hand, her jaw tightening as her gaze dropped to the soil.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio watched her for a moment, the tension clear in Agatha’s shoulders and in the way she shifted uncomfortably under the weight of what she wasn’t saying. With a quiet sigh, “Look, this doesn’t have to be anything if you don’t want it to be, okay?” she said, her tone gentle and free of pressure. “But… hypothetically, if you were to ask me if this were a date, I’d hypothetically say yes.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s head snapped up, her eyes meeting Rio’s in surprise. “Hypothetically?” she asked, her voice softer now, the tension in her chest easing just slightly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shrugged, “Yeah. Hypothetically.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“This is a date, Rio,” Agatha said, her voice firmer now, even as her cheeks flushed deeper. She placed her trowel on the ground, brushing her hands off nervously.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio looked at her, her expression softening as a slow smile spread across her face. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha nodded, her eyes meeting Rio’s. “Yeah,” she said quietly, the weight of the moment settling over her. “It is.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s smile grew, warm and genuine, that Agatha could see the gap in her teeth “Good,” she said softly. “Because I was hoping it was.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s shoulders straightened, a flicker of her usual confidence returning. She cleared her throat, brushing imaginary dirt from her hands. “Hypothetically,” she began, her tone measured, “if I wanted to kiss you, would you let me?” She paused, her lips curving into a faint smirk. “Hypothetically.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio raised an eyebrow, her smile widening slightly as she leaned back, “Well…” she drawled, letting the moment hang for just a second longer than necessary. “Hypothetically, a lady doesn’t kiss and tell. But I wouldn’t stop you.” She cast a quick glance to the side, her smile softening as her eyes returned to Agatha’s. “Hypothetically.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s breath caught for a brief moment, but her smirk only grew, her confidence solidifying. “Good to know,” she murmured, leaning in just slightly, her voice and eyes dropping to something softer. “I’m gonna kiss you, now. Not hypothetically.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Please,” Rio whispered, her voice barely audible, her eyes fixed on Agatha’s lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And then Agatha closed the gap, her lips meeting Rio’s in a kiss that was soft but firm, like every moment had been leading to this one. Rio responded instantly, her lips warm and unhurried, matching Agatha’s tenderness.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As Agatha went to deepen the kiss, leaning in just a little more, Rio pulled away, her eyes half lidded and a playful smirk tugging at her lips. “You’ll have to work a little harder for more,” she murmured, her tone teasing but the warmth in her gaze unmistakable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha blinked, a flicker of surprise crossing her face before it was replaced by a confident grin. “Oh, I will,” she promised, her voice low and full of intent.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio chuckled softly, leaning back slightly, her smirk lingering as she picked up a stray leaf and let it fall from her hand. “Looking forward to it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The air between them shifted, lighter but still humming with unspoken promises.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha lay in her bed, staring at the ceiling. It had been a few days since her unexpected date in the garden with Rio, and yet the memory still lingered, casting a lightness over her days that she had not felt in longer than she could remember.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was a strange predicament to spend what felt like a trillion years grieving not just her son but also the love of her life, only to find herself here. She had spent so long running, never stopping, hoping that if enough time passed she might forget. Forget the pain, the love, the ache of everything she had lost.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But who was she kidding? That was no way to live.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Not that she regretted it. If she was being honest, some of those years had been fun. Agatha smirked faintly at the thought. Some people deserved the wrath she had unleashed on them. And if it kept her from falling apart, even just a little, who could blame her?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Still, as she stared at the ceiling, the weight of her choices pressed on her. Running had kept her alive, but it had not made her whole. And now, with Rio back in her life and Sage being Sage, she could not help but wonder if she had finally found something worth staying still for.<br/><br/><br/></span>
</p><p>Did Agatha want to get her purple back? Absolutely, she did. If she could, she would. It wasn’t just magic- it was her. A part of her identity, her power, her essence. The loss of it felt like losing a piece of herself, and if she had the chance to reclaim it, she wouldn’t hesitate.</p><p class="p2"><br/><br/>But if someone were to ask what she’d do with it, Agatha wouldn’t have an answer. She could go back to the surface, wreak havoc, massacre a few people, and fall into the same endless cycle. She wouldn’t mind it. In fact, it might even be fun for a while. But for whatever stupid, infuriating reason, she didn’t crave it anymore. The hunger that once clawed at her from the inside, gnawing at her ribs and demanding more, had gone quiet.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She wondered if it would come back with just a taste. Would the chaos inside her wake up, roaring for more? Or was it gone for good?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She didn’t know.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">What she did know was that whenever the thought of power crept into her mind, it was when she was around Sage. She found herself wishing she could show Sage, wondering what the girl would think of her at her peak. Sage was brilliant. Insanely brilliant. Agatha could sense it now more than ever, this quiet, coiled strength beneath Sage’s sharp wit and sarcastic remarks. It was there, waiting, and Agatha wasn’t sure if Sage even realized how strong she truly was.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She knew the girl’s magic, its unique color burned into her memory. It wasn’t fully black, though that was its base. It shimmered just enough to almost appear gray, but there was more to it than that. Agatha couldn’t quite explain it, but the best way to describe it was this: if green and purple were locked in a constant battle, their energies intertwining and fighting for dominance, creating something entirely new in their struggle. It wasn’t just a color, it was alive, shifting, almost breathing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was beautiful, unlike anything Agatha had ever seen, and impossible to define. It had a depth and complexity that felt like it held secrets, just out of reach. It was Sage’s magic, and it suited her perfectly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hardly ever saw Sage practice magic. There were the occasional portals and the weather shifting with her moods, but nothing that hinted at the raw force Agatha could feel simmering beneath the surface. It made her itch to see it, that hidden power unleashed, like a tickle deep in her ribcage that she couldn’t shake.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But it wasn’t for siphoning purposes, not this time. Agatha had no interest in seeking Sage’s magic for herself. She wanted to see her daughter in action, to see her </span> <span class="s2">be</span> <span class="s1"> a witch. She wanted to be proud of her, to know that this extraordinary force of nature had come from her.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio knew it too. She could sense Sage’s power in a way that made her proud. She would brag about Sage’s intellect, recounting memories of teaching her practical magic as a child. Rio would share how Sage needed no more than a single explanation to understand a spell, though it often took a few tries to master it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha loved hearing these stories. Every word was like a glimpse into moments she had missed, moments she could never get back. Rio was unknowingly giving her a gift- a chance to imagine what it might have been like if she had been there. And, in a strange way, it was enough. Enough to make her feel like she belonged here, that she had a place in their lives, even if it was still unsteady.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But doubt always crept in, dragging guilt along with it. Nicky.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha had known, from Rio’s words weeks ago, that Sage saw him when she slept. But she couldn’t bring herself to ask Sage about it. She couldn’t ask what he was like, what he looked like, if he was happy. Was he truly at peace? Did peace even mean anything? Or was there something more, something after the afterlife?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">These thoughts were too big, too heavy for her to hold. They churned in the back of her mind, questions she wasn’t ready to face, not yet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">One day, maybe she would be ready to speak his name, to ask the questions clawing at her heart. But not yet. Not today. Today she would sit with the quiet joy Rio’s stories brought her, let herself pretend that was enough. For now, it had to be.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The next day flew by in a haze of debates and half-played chess games. Agatha and Sage had long abandoned the idea of taking the game seriously, instead turning every move into a conversation about something ridiculous.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At one point, Sage casually mentioned a tree Rio had decided was the perfect climbing challenge when she was eight. She laughed while describing how Rio had tied a rope around one of the higher branches and shouted, “Just grab on and start climbing! You’ll figure it out!” Sage’s story ended with her dangling precariously halfway up, her foot slipping on the bark, and Rio attempting to “rescue” her, only to lose her grip and fall into a pile of leaves below.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s blood pressure spiked just imagining it. “You’re both insane,” she muttered, shaking her head. “No self-preservation whatsoever.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage just grinned. “Character building,” she said, with a glint in her eye that was far too similar to Rio’s.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t press further, but the story lingered with her longer than she wanted to admit.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Later in the day, Sage leaned back in her chair, her voice casual as she mentioned she’d be heading to the surface that night.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t react immediately, keeping her face neutral as she adjusted a chess piece. She nodded slightly, brushing it off as if it didn’t matter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage, sharp as ever, teased her. “Don’t miss me too much,” she said with a grin. “I’ll be back in the morning to crush you at chess and out-debate you on every topic.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha rolled her eyes and waved a dismissive hand. “You’re delusional if you think you’re winning this time,” she said, but the faint tug of a smile betrayed her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Sage finally left, the house felt quieter, but not unbearably so. Agatha stayed at the chessboard for a while longer, her fingers brushing against the edge of a pawn as her thoughts wandered. She wasn’t used to this, but she found herself settling into it all the same, already waiting for tomorrow.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Later that night, Agatha sat in the guest room, the soft hum of a TV show playing in the background. Scratchy’s playpen was tucked neatly in the corner, and a dresser with a TV perched on top filled the otherwise sparse space. Agatha wasn’t paying attention to the show she’d put on. Her fingers drummed idly against the bedspread as she leaned back against the headboard, a book open in her lap.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It was </span> <span class="s2"><em>The Sea Around Us</em>,</span> <span class="s1"> another Rachel Carson book that Sage had unceremoniously tossed at her one morning when she walked out onto the patio. Sage’s slanted handwriting filled the margins, annotations ranging from sarcastic remarks to surprisingly thoughtful reflections.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tried to focus on the book, her eyes scanning the same line over and over, but her mind kept wandering. The room felt empty in a way that was hard to ignore, and she found herself thinking about the nights she used to spend next to a certain green witch. Her fingers stilled on the bedspread, a quiet sigh escaping her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words on the page blurred as her thoughts drifted. Agatha couldn’t tell if it was the book, the room, or something else entirely, but staying focused felt impossible tonight.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With a final sigh, Agatha snapped the book shut and tossed it onto the nightstand, the sound sharp in the quiet room. Frustration prickled at her as she threw the covers off and swung her legs over the edge of the bed. She needed to move, to do something other than sit and let her thoughts spiral.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She made her way to the door, yanking it open without a second thought.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She stopped short, startled by the sight in front of her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was standing there, her hand frozen in the air, as though she’d been about to knock. She wore a sweatshirt and boxers, her hair pulled back in a loose bun. Her wide brown eyes met Agatha’s, and for a moment, the two of them just stared at each other.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio awkwardly dropped her hand and breathed out a quiet, “Hi.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hey yourself,” Agatha replied, her voice just as soft, her surprise melting into something steadier.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I- um… couldn’t sleep,” Rio admitted, her words hesitant as she glanced down briefly before meeting Agatha’s gaze again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Neither could I,” Agatha said, her fingers brushing against the edge of the door as if to ground herself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shifted slightly, her eyes flicking past Agatha into the room before returning to her. “Can I come in?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitated for only a moment before shaking her head lightly, a faint smirk tugging at her lips. “Can we go to yours?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s shoulders immediately relaxed, and she let out a quiet breath, her relief almost palpable. “Yeah,” she said softly, a small, genuine smile crossing her lips. “Yeah, of course.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio started to turn away, her steps hesitant, but then stopped halfway. She turned back, reaching out to grab Agatha’s hand, her grip warm. “I might have a better idea,” she said, her voice filled with quiet confidence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha raised an eyebrow, a smirk tugging at her lips. “And what’s that?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s expression shifted, a teasing glint sparking in her eyes as she suddenly dropped to one knee, still holding Agatha’s hand. “Agatha Harkness,” she began, her tone overly dramatic, “will you go on a date with me?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha groaned loudly, rolling her eyes. “Right now?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio nodded earnestly, “Right now.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Jesus fucking Christ, this is so gay,” Agatha muttered, but the corners of her mouth twitched, betraying her amusement.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio grinned, unfazed. “Is that a yes?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a long, exasperated sigh, yanking her hand away with a dramatic flourish. “Of course it’s a fucking yes.” She pretended to be annoyed, crossing her arms. “What are we doing?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Uh…” Rio paused, her grin faltering as she realized she hadn’t thought that far ahead. “Star gazing?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha snorted, shaking her head as she motioned for Rio to stand. “You’re ridiculous,” she said. “But fine. Let’s go look at the stars.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They found themselves outside in the front yard, lying side by side on a blanket under the wide expanse of stars. The night was quiet, the cool air settling around them, and neither had spoken much since they’d come out here.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Between them, their hands rested on the blanket, close but not quite touching. Agatha stared up at the stars, her thoughts a whirl of everything and nothing, until she felt the faintest brush of Rio’s pinky against hers.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her breath hitched, her chest tightening as she froze, unsure if it was an accident or something deliberate. The small touch lingered, light and hesitant, and Agatha’s pulse quickened. She glanced sideways at Rio, but Rio’s gaze was still fixed on the sky, her expression calm, though there was a faint tension in the way her shoulders rose and fell.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitated, her fingers twitching slightly before she let them move, just enough to hook her pinky with Rio’s. The contact was small, almost insignificant, but the warmth of it spread through her chest like fire catching.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s lips curved into the faintest of smiles, though she still didn’t look away from the stars. “You’re holding your breath,” she murmured softly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a sharp exhale, rolling her eyes even as her lips twitched into a reluctant smile. “You’re imagining things,” she said.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio finally turned her head slightly, her warm brown eyes catching Agatha’s in the dim light. “Am I?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t answer, her gaze flicking back up to the stars as her pinky stayed locked with Rio’s. The silence stretched between them, but it wasn’t heavy. It was warm, filled with the quiet hum of something unspoken.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Neither of them moved to let go.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio broke the silence first, her voice soft and low. “You know, on the surface, when I couldn’t find you, I’d look up at the stars. It was the only thing that kept me feeling close to you. Knowing that somewhere, you were under the same sky I was.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s chest tightened at the words, her gaze still fixed upward. She wasn’t sure how to respond, the weight of Rio’s quiet confession settling over her like the night air. Her pinky twitched slightly against Rio’s, still hooked together, as she let the silence stretch for a moment longer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“That’s… stupidly poetic,” Agatha finally said, her voice soft, almost teasing. But there was no malice in her words, only a quiet warmth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio chuckled lightly, “Maybe. But it helped.” She turned her head slightly, her gaze on Agatha now instead of the stars. “It was the only thing that made it feel like you weren’t completely gone.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I thought at some point you’d stop looking,” Agatha admitted quietly, her voice barely above a whisper.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She didn’t need to say more, Rio would never know the depth of that thought. The way it had driven her for so long. It was why Agatha had kept killing witches, why she left chaos in her wake. She could not shake the memory of Rio, could not escape it no matter how far she ran. If she had to live without Rio and without her son, burdened by her choices and her grief, then she would make sure Rio would </span> <span class="s1">not forget her either. Every act, every body, every trail of destruction was a reminder of Agatha’s existence.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s pinky tightened slightly against hers, and her voice was steady when she finally spoke. “I never stopped looking,” she said, her tone carrying something heavier underneath. “You’ve never been subtle, you know. All those bodies you left for dead? They were hard to miss.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha huffed out a humorless laugh, tilting her head to look at Rio. “I guess that was the point.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio turned her head, meeting Agatha’s gaze, her eyes softer than her words. “I know,” she said quietly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s eyes stayed locked on Rio’s, the world around them fading into the background. The stars above seemed distant, their light paling in comparison to the warmth in Rio’s gaze.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shifted onto her side, propping her head up with her hand. Her movements were slow, as though she was waiting for Agatha to stop her. But Agatha didn’t move, couldn’t move, not when Rio’s hand reached out to gently brush against her cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s breath hitched, her eyes fluttering closed at the touch. It was soft, almost tentative, and yet it held a quiet assurance that made something inside her chest ache.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t pull away. Instead, she let herself lean into it, her heartbeat loud and insistent in her ears. When she opened her eyes again, Rio’s expression was calm, but her brown eyes held a depth that Agatha could feel in her very core.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Neither of them said anything. Words felt unnecessary, even intrusive, in the stillness that surrounded them. Agatha’s lips parted slightly, but no sound came out, just a shallow exhale as Rio’s thumb moved in a slow, gentle stroke along her cheekbone.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swallowed hard, her voice barely above a whisper when she finally spoke. “You’re staring,” Repeating Rio’s words from days earlier. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s lips curved into the faintest smile, her voice just as soft. “So are you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a shaky breath, her chest tightening again, but she didn’t look away. She couldn’t. Something about this moment felt too important to let slip away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Can I kiss you?” Rio asked, her voice barely more than a whisper, her hand still warm against Agatha’s cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s lips curved into a smirk, her chest tightening as she held Rio’s gaze. “I’d be pissed if you didn’t,” she murmured, her voice laced with quiet amusement.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s smile widened just slightly before she leaned in, closing the space between them. When their lips met, it was soft and unhurried. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s hand moved instinctively to Rio’s wrist, her fingers curling lightly against the fabric of her sweatshirt. The kiss carried with it an undeniable certainty, as if this was exactly where they were supposed to be.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha let her tongue drag slowly against Rio’s bottom lip, </span> <span class="s1">an unspoken plea to deepen the kiss. Rio granted permission without hesitation, parting her lips and meeting Agatha halfway. The shift was electric, and Agatha couldn’t stop the soft whimper that escaped her as their tongues met.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The kiss grew hungrier, more demanding, as if all the tension between them had found its release.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tilted her head to deepen the kiss, pressing herself closer as her free hand found Rio’s waist, gripping her like she needed to keep her there. Rio responded in kind, her thumb brushing along the line of Agatha’s jaw before sliding into her hair, the gesture equal parts grounding and possessive.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio moved over Agatha, her weight pressing them closer together as Agatha adjusted beneath her, letting her take the lead. Their lips barely parted as their foreheads rested against one another, their breathing heavy, bodies close enough to feel the warmth shared between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was the first to speak, her words halting as though searching for the right ones. “I can’t- … I mean- …. I’m not ready to…”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Whatever she wants.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Whatever you want,” Agatha said simply, her voice certain, meeting Rio’s gaze without hesitation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio nodded quickly, her lips brushing against Agatha’s in a way that sent a jolt through both of them. She leaned back in, their mouths meeting again with more urgency this time, a quiet hum escaping Rio’s throat. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shifted, her leg moving between Agatha’s. The pressure was gentle at first, but it was enough to make Agatha gasp softly against her lips, her hips moving instinctively in response. Rio stilled for a heartbeat, searching Agatha’s face, her eyes wide and questioning.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha met her gaze, her fingers curling into Rio’s sweatshirt as she nodded. “It’s okay,” she murmured, her voice shaky.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That was all Rio needed. She leaned back in, her lips capturing Agatha’s again as their bodies began to move together. Agatha let out a quiet whimper, her hips rolling against Rio’s thigh, and Rio pressed closer, her own movements syncing with Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s head fell back slightly, breaking the kiss for a moment, and Rio took the opportunity to trail her lips along Agatha’s jaw, down to her neck. Agatha’s fingers found their way to Rio’s hair, a soft, shaky moan escaping her as she moved against Rio’s thigh, the friction sending shivers through her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio pressed herself down harder against Agatha, her breath catching as a loud moan escaped her lips. Rio’s movements stilled for just a moment, her forehead moving to rest against Agatha’s as their eyes locked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio whimpered softly, overwhelmed by the intensity of the moment. Agatha didn’t look away, her hands still tangled in Rio’s hair, her chest rising and falling rapidly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They began rocking into each other, firm and quick, their bodies moving in perfect rhythm. Their eyes stayed locked, neither daring to look away, the intensity between them growing with every shift and press of their hips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Agatha, I’m gonn-” Rio’s voice broke into a sharp gasp, her movements faltering for just a second.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Me too,” Agatha managed to reply, her voice breathless, her hands move to Rio’s waist as she tried to steady herself against the wave building inside her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The heat pooling in Agatha’s core was impossible to ignore, every motion, every sound, pushing her closer to the edge. She tilted her head back slightly, her mouth falling open as her body tightened, the tension reaching a breaking point.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s forehead still rested against hers, their breaths mingling in short, ragged gasps as their bodies moved together, the rhythm becoming erratic as they both chased that final release. Agatha’s hands slid up to Rio’s back, holding her close, their connection grounding her even as everything else seemed to spiral out of control.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Agatha,” Rio whimpered, her voice trembling, her body pressing harder against her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha gasped, her own name sounding foreign as she clung to the moment, the heat in her core finally snapping, sending her over the edge with a cry she couldn’t hold back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio followed seconds later, her body shuddering against Agatha’s as she buried her face into the crook of her neck, a soft moan escaping her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha lay there, Rio’s weight pressed against her, both of them struggling to catch their breath. The cool night air did little to calm the heat still coursing through her body. She blinked up at the stars for a moment before glancing back at Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Did we just…” Agatha asked, her voice shaky but laced with amusement.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio leaned back slightly to look at her, her expression both smug and breathless. “Yup.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">A breathy laugh escaped Agatha, but it caught in her throat the second she felt Rio’s hand move between them. Her heart skipped, her body stiffening slightly, her gaze snapping back to Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes locked onto hers, dark and unwavering, as her hand slipped lower. Agatha didn’t dare look away, her breath hitching as she realized what Rio was doing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She could feel Rio’s hand moving beneath the fabric of Rio’s own waistband, and the deliberate, confident way Rio’s expression shifted sent a new wave of heat surging through her. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without breaking their gaze, Rio brought her fingers to Agatha’s lips. The look in her eyes dared Agatha to resist, but she didn’t even hesitate. Instinctively, Agatha opened her mouth, and Rio pushed her fingers inside.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s lips closed around them, her eyes fluttering shut for a brief moment as the taste hit her tongue. A muffled moan escaped her, and when her gaze returned to Rio, she saw her own desire mirrored back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s breath hitched at the sight, a low, guttural moan escaping her lips as she watched Agatha’s mouth work around her fingers. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha pulled her mouth from Rio’s fingers, her head falling back against the blanket as a smug smirk played on her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio let out a scoff, rolling her eyes with mock exasperation. But before Agatha could say anything, Rio leaned in, capturing her lips in another kiss. Her tongue traced every inch of Agatha’s mouth, tasting herself in the process, the intimacy of the act sending a shiver down Agatha’s spine.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio finally pulled away, she didn’t say a word. She rolled onto her back beside Agatha, their bodies still close, their breathing slowly evening out. Above them, the stars glittered against the vast sky, but neither seemed to care much about the view.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt Rio’s hand slide into hers, their fingers tangling together as if it was the most natural thing in the world. She turned her head slightly to glance at Rio, who was still staring upward, her expression calm but her lips tugged into the faintest of smiles.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re gonna be the death of me,” Rio murmured, her voice teasing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s smirk widened as she gave Rio’s hand a small squeeze. “That’s the plan,” she replied.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They stayed like that, hand in hand, small smiles lingering on their faces, as the night carried on around them. There was no need to say anything more.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The next morning, Agatha sat on the patio, her fingers wrapped around a warm mug of coffee. The quiet morning air was broken by the sound of the back door slamming open. Rio stormed outside, she was obviously pissed. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">From inside, Agatha could faintly hear Sage’s voice calling after her. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio marched across the patio toward the garden. Agatha raised her mug to take a sip, trying not to appear too interested, when Sage burst through the back door, her voice trailing after Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I just don’t get why you’re so pissed off!” Sage exclaimed, exasperation dripping from every word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio whirled around so fast it startled both Agatha and Sage. “Look at your arm!” she yelled, pointing furiously.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze followed Rio’s gesture to Sage’s wrist, where a fresh tattoo wrapped itself around her skin. It was a snake, coiling elegantly around her wrist, its head resting neatly on top of her hand. The detail was intricate, and Agatha had to admit, it was impressive work.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio, however, didn’t seem to share her appreciation. Agatha pressed her lips together tightly, trying to stifle the laugh bubbling in her chest. Of all the things to send Rio into a rage, a tattoo? She had to bite down on her lip to keep herself from bursting out laughing, especially as Sage crossed her arms, her expression defiant.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“It’s just a tattoo!” Sage retorted, lifting her arm higher, as if to show it off. “And it looks cool!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Cool?” Rio’s voice pitched higher, her frustration palpable. “You didn’t even tell me you were getting this!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage rolled her eyes dramatically, her stance practically screaming rebellion. “I didn’t think I needed permission.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha finally couldn’t hold it in anymore. A laugh escaped her unexpected, drawing both Rio and Sage’s attention. She cleared her throat, quickly covering her smile with her coffee cup. “Sorry,” she muttered, though the amused glint in her eyes said otherwise.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shot her a withering glare. “You’re not helping.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha raised her hand innocently, the grin she tried to hide slipping back onto her face. “I didn’t say anything,” she said lightly, though her tone was far too smug to be convincing. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage smirked at Agatha’s reaction, “See? Even she thinks it’s not a big deal.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio groaned, dragging a hand down her face as she turned back toward the garden. “Just let me be pissed off,” she muttered, marching off again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage and Agatha exchanged a quick glance, the same mischievous glint in both their eyes. “Nice job,” Agatha said with a smirk, raising her coffee mug in a mock toast.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Thanks,” Sage replied, her grin widening. “It’s a gift.” She made her way to the chair across from Agatha and plops down, “So, have you thought about it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Have I thought about what?” Agatha replied, though she knew exactly what Sage was talking about.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“My birthday. You know, going to the surface?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Have you talked to Rio about it?” Agatha countered, buying herself time to dodge a real answer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Not yet,” Sage admitted, shrugging. “I was about to, but then she decided to have a meltdown about a tattoo of all things.” She glanced down at her wrist, turning it slightly to admire the ink.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smirked faintly into her coffee cup. “We’ll see.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage rolled her eyes, leaning back into her chair. “Yeah, that’s what you always say when you’re avoiding a conversation.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t bother denying it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage’s attention shifted, her gaze flicking over to the garden where Rio stood aggressively throwing food to the koi fish. After a moment, Sage turned her attention back to Agatha. “Have you read </span> <em> <span class="s2">The Sea Around Us</span> </em> <span class="s1"> yet?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I’m getting to it,” Agatha replied, taking a long sip of her coffee, and meeting Sage’s inquisitive stare.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s eyes darted back to Rio and then back to Agatha, narrowing slightly as if a thought had just occurred to her. “Are y’all dating or something?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s coffee went down the wrong pipe, and she immediately choked, coughing violently as she tried to regain her composure. Sage leaned forward, her tongue fighting to poke into her cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What?” Agatha croaked, her eyes watering as she set her cup down with a clatter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You heard me,” Sage said, her tone far too casual. “You and Rio. There’s been a </span> <span class="s2">vibe.</span> <span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha glared at her through narrowed eyes, though the flush rising to her cheeks betrayed her. “You’ve got quite the imagination, kid.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Uh-huh.” Sage leaned back again, crossing her arms. “So that’s a yes.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“It’s not a yes!” Agatha snapped, her voice rising.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Not a no, either,” Sage shot back, her smirk and eyes widening, her tongue fully poking into her cheek. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, muttering under her breath. “I need stronger coffee for this.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The conversation abruptly ended as Sage pushed back from the table, her chair scraping loudly against the patio. Her eyes locked onto something above the house, her entire body going rigid.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha frowned, following Sage’s gaze, but before she could ask, she noticed Rio. She wasn’t looking at the fish anymore. Instead, her head was tilted back, her gaze fixed on the same spot in the sky that had captured Sage’s attention.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What’s wrong?” Agatha shouted. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Someone’s here,” Sage mumbled. She didn’t look at Agatha, her focus unwavering as she moved quickly across the patio toward the back door.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s eyes darted between Sage and Rio, “You gonna do something about this?” she demanded, throwing her arms out toward Rio, who still hadn’t moved.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shrugged, her calm demeanor infuriating. “She’ll handle it,” she called out as she turned her attention back to the koi pond. She tossed another handful of food to the fish as if nothing unusual was happening.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha groaned, her patience snapping as she pushed back her chair. “Of course she will,” she muttered, rolling her eyes as she started after Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She paused at the back door, casting a sharp glare over her shoulder at Rio, who didn’t even look up. Agatha huffed, muttering to herself, “Unbelievable,” before stepping inside and chasing after Sage.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">By the time Agatha stepped out onto the front porch, Sage was already halfway down the path, moving with purpose. Agatha’s gaze shifted upward, and that’s when she saw him.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><em>Teen</em>. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">He descended with an almost unsettling grace, his feet hovering just above the ground. Blue orbs of light swirled and pulsed around his hands, casting an eerie glow. His cape billowed behind him, catching the wind perfectly, as if he’d timed it. Agatha watched, unimpressed, one brow arching. It was all very dramatic.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And now Agatha understood why Rio hadn’t bothered to see who had entered her realm. It wasn’t indifference; it was strategy. Agatha had a soft spot for him (if you could even call it that) and Rio? Rio knew it was easier to feign ignorance than to deal with the whole </span> <span class="s2">abomination situation</span> <span class="s1">. The loophole Agatha created had restored the sacred balance, and as far as Rio was concerned, that was enough to keep her from getting involved. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">To be honest, Agatha had completely forgotten about him. Not surprising, really- she had a tendency to suffer from a bit of object permanence when it came to people. If they weren’t directly in her line of sight or causing her immediate trouble, well, they might as well not exist.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But now he was here, floating ominously down onto the path, and he very much </span> <span class="s2">was</span> <span class="s1"> her problem again. Agatha crossed her arms, narrowing her eyes as she muttered under her breath, “Well, this should be fun.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’ve got a lot of nerve showing up here, you know that?” Sage called out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy landed lightly on the path, his expression unreadable. “I’m here for my familiar,” he said flatly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Did your mother not teach you any manners? You don’t just show up, unannounced, to people’s homes and steal their jokes,” Sage shot back, her smirk already forming.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy’s eyes narrowed slightly, his voice cutting, “You gonna keep running your mouth, or are you actually gonna do something about it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage’s smirk twisted into a wide, almost manic grin, her eyes lighting up full of excitement. She stepped forward, her hands out, palms up, fingers twitching as her voice rang out in an excited, almost gleeful scream. “</span> <span class="s2">MAKE ME!</span> <span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“God she really is my daughter.” Agatha says with a wave of her hand, like it isn’t the most obvious thing in the world. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The air around her pulsed, vibrating with the anticipation of the fight, as her power began to spark and crackle like a storm ready to break.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy charged at Sage, his body colliding with hers in a blur of motion. Before Agatha could fully register what was happening, they shot up into the sky, disappearing into the clouds at an alarming speed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze for half a second, her eyes narrowing as the realization hit her. “Well, that’s not good,” she muttered under her breath, already moving down the steps.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck,” she grumbled, each word growing more exasperated as she picked up her pace, her head snapping upward, trying to track them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Suddenly, Agatha’s eyes caught movement above. Sage and Billy were tumbling through the air, a chaotic tangle of limbs spinning wildly. They plummeted toward the clearing, hitting the ground with a heavy thud.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When the dust settled, Sage was on top of Billy, her knees bracketing his hips and her fists gripping his shirt. The momentum sent them sliding through the grass, the force of the landing etched into the trail they left behind.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With a sudden burst of blue power from Billy, Sage was ripped off of him, the force sending her flying a few yards away. She hit the ground with a thud, rolling to a stop before springing back to her feet, her eyes blazing with fury.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha, standing a safe distance away, raised an eyebrow as Billy groaned, flipping onto his stomach and lifting his head to look at her. “You gonna help me out?” he called, his voice strained.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha crossed her arms, smirking slightly. “Sorry, Teen, but you started this fight. I’ll let you go ahead and finish it,” she shouted back, her tone dripping with amusement.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Billy groaned louder, muttering something under his breath, while Sage stalked toward him, her hands sparking with that grayish magic. “Oh, don’t worry,” she said, her voice dangerously low. “I’ll </span> <span class="s2">end</span> <span class="s1"> it.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">What made Agatha’s smirk fall was Sage’s expression. She looked furious. Her face was bloodied and smeared with dirt, small cuts scattered across her skin, though none were as bad as Billy’s. A vein pulsed angrily on her forehead, and her jaw was clenched tight enough to break.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage thrust one hand outward with a commanding motion, her fingers curling as if pulling invisible strings. The ground beneath them quivered, vibrating before thick vines erupted from the earth, twisting and writhing like living creatures.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The vines snapped to attention, racing toward Billy and coiling tightly around his ankles. He let out a startled yell and with a sharp pull of Sage’s arm back toward her they yanked him back, dragging him across the grass toward Sage, his hands clawing at the ground in a useless attempt to stop himself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But the unease grew as Agatha kept watching. She had never seen Sage so genuinely pissed. Sure, the girl was sharp tongued and had her moods, but this was different. This was fury. The kind of anger that made Agatha’s stomach twist, not because of what Sage might do to Billy, but because of how consuming it seemed, like it could burn everything in its path.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Alright, kid,” Agatha called out, taking cautious steps forward, her voice laced with a calm she didn’t feel. “That’s enough. You’ve made your point.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t respond, her focus locked entirely on Billy as the vines tightened their grip, pulling him closer still. Her eyes burned with something wild, something Agatha wasn’t sure she liked seeing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s brow furrowed, her worry growing as she took another step forward. “Sage,” she tried again, her tone firmer this time. “Let him go! Now!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With a flick of her wrist, Billy was flipped over onto his back, hitting the ground with a grunt. Sage’s arms moved in one fluid motion, spreading wide before snapping together in command. Vines burst from the earth once more, slithering toward Billy like living ropes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">One coiled tightly around each of his arms, pinning them to the ground. Another shot out, wrapping around his neck with precision, the grip tightening with every passing second. Billy let out a strained gasp, his body struggling against the relentless vines.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sage! I said enough!” Agatha yelled. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s green eyes, filled with unshed tears, stood in stark contrast to the furious red that flushed her face. Above them, storm clouds churned ominously, dark and heavy, their presence a reflection of Sage’s turmoil.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Why won’t you just go away?” Sage spat through gritted teeth, her voice trembling with emotion. She loomed over Billy, her fists clenched, the vines around his neck tightening even further. Billy struggled against the restraints, his gasps becoming more frantic.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s chest tightened as she watched the vines coil tighter around Billy’s neck, his gasps starting to grow weaker. Panic surged in her chest as her eyes darted between him and Sage. Sage looked furious, completely consumed, her trembling hands glowing faintly with gray magic. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy’s face had started to pale, his body slackening as the vines gripped harder. Agatha’s heart raced, an unfamiliar fear clawing its way through her. This wasn’t about power anymore; it was about control, and Sage was fucking losing it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha took a shaky step forward, her body rigid as she tried to process what was happening. Her voice finally broke through, the words tearing out of her like she couldn’t stop them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“If you do this, I will hate you forever!” she screamed, the sound fractured and desperate, slicing through the tension. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage looked up at this, her eyes brimming with so much hurt and her face twisting in disgust, it made Agatha’s stomach churn. It was a look she was far too familiar with. For a moment, the rage that had consumed Sage flickered, replaced by something far more fragile. Then Sage’s gaze shifted, glancing past Agatha toward something behind her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The vines around Billy’s body slackened, retreating back into the ground. He lay there, coughing and gasping for air, unmoving except for the rise and fall of his chest. The storm clouds above still churned, but a sharp gust of wind swept through the clearing, scattering loose leaves and breaking the suffocating stillness. </span>Sage’s hands fell to her sides, trembling.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage’s gaze dropped back down to Billy, her expression hardening again as she seethed through clenched teeth, “Novice.” </span>Her lips curled into a snarl, and as she stepped over him, she snapped her teeth in the air, the act was animalistic, like a dog warning its prey to back off. She spit on the ground near his head, her disdain evident, then nudged his head with her foot before striding toward the house without hesitation.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t look at Agatha as she passed, her gaze locked straight ahead. Her shoulder knocked into Agatha’s with enough force to make her stumble slightly, but the young witch didn’t slow or acknowledge it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha whipped around, her mouth already open to yell something back, but the words died on her lips when she saw Rio standing several feet away, her arms crossed, her gaze unreadable as she watched everything unfold. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze stayed fixed on Rio, her stomach churning as the realization struck her. It wasn’t her that Sage had listened to. It had been Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She had thrown words at Sage, cruel and cutting words, desperate to stop her. Words meant to hurt, and they had. She saw it in the way Sage’s face had twisted, in the way her shoulders had trembled when she let the vines fall. But it wasn’t Agatha’s words that had made Sage stop. It wasn’t her at all.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Of course it was. Rio didn’t need to shout or manipulate. She was the one Sage looked to when everything spiraled out of control.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was her mother in every way Agatha wasn’t.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swallowed hard, the bitterness clawing at her. She had been desperate enough to wound Sage, and it hadn’t even mattered. She had been the villain in her own daughter’s story while Rio had simply stood there and been enough.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t dwell on what had just happened, not now. She needed to check on Teen. Her irritation burned hotter with every step she took toward him. This whole show, his cocky attitude and theatrics, was going to get him killed one day.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When she reached him, Billy was still sprawled on the ground, groaning softly. Without a second thought, Agatha grabbed him by the front of his shirt with both fists and yanked him off the ground.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Get up!” she snapped.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sighed, releasing her grip on Billy’s shirt before brushing the dirt off his shoulders with quick, irritated swipes. “You okay?” she asked, her voice tinged with only the slightest hint of concern.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy straightened, wobbling slightly before muttering, “I’ll live… no thanks to that bitch.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hey,” Agatha snapped, her voice rising as she stepped closer with a finger pointed in his face. “Watch your mouth, Teen. You don’t know half of what you’re talking about, and that overly inflated ego is going to get you killed.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Whatever. Are you ready to go?” Billy asked, still glaring at her, his tone impatient.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “Go where?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy sighed heavily, tilting his head back like he couldn’t believe he had to explain. “Back to the surface, obviously. I don’t exactly see a Ritz-Carlton around here, and that freak isn’t exactly giving me the warm and fuzzies.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">He jerked his head toward the house, and Agatha followed his motion. There, standing in the window, was Sage with her arms crossed, glaring at them both with an expression that could cut glass.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha rolled her eyes and turned away from the window. As she did, she felt the first cool drops of rain on her skin. She looked up at the sky, where the storm clouds had thickened, swirling ominously overhead.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha looked at Billy, her expression deadpan as she rolled her eyes again. Without missing a beat, she raised her hand and slapped him on the back of the head.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“That freak has a name,” she said, the tone of her voice laced with more than just annoyance.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Ow!” Billy flinched, clutching the back of his head with an exaggerated gasp. “Was that really necessary?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Yes,” Agatha replied flatly, glancing back at the house where Sage was still glaring at them from the window. “You need to go.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy’s face twisted in disbelief. “I need to go? Seriously? After all of this?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Yes,” Agatha said again, her voice colder this time.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy let out a bitter laugh, shaking his head, “Unbelievable. Who even is she?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitated, her expression hardening as the words caught in her throat. She glanced at the ground, her shoulders tense, before finally looking up at him. “She’s Rio’s daughter.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Billy blinked, his jaw dropping slightly. “Rio’s…” He trailed off, his brows furrowing. “Wait. You mean </span> <span class="s2">your </span> <span class="s1">Rio?” </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Yes.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy’s eyes narrowed, his suspicion deepening. “You’re not telling me everything,” he said, his voice quieter, like he was trying to piece it together himself. “What aren’t you saying?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sighed, wiping rain from her face as she glanced at him. “You’re a big boy. Do the math.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy blinked, his brain clearly racing to connect the dots. His gaze darted from Agatha to the house, then back to her. “Wait. No. You’re not saying-“</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> “Congratulations, you figured it out,” Agatha said, deadpan. “Do you want a prize?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Actually, a prize would be nice,” Billy said, crossing his arms. “But you’ve got a magic murder daughter staring at me like she’s measuring me for a coffin. I have so many questions.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Questions that aren’t any of your damn business,” Agatha shot back. “And she’s not a coffin person. She’s more of a ‘turn-you-into-compost’ type.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She thinks,</span> <span class="s2"> <em>Rio would likely be the type to build coffin</em></span> <span class="s1"> <em>s.</em> </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy blinked.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh, great. Eco-friendly homicide. That’s a relief.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Don’t take it personally,” Agatha said. “Now scram, because I have business to attend to, and by business I mean I have to fucking go in there and apologize, which is something I literally never fucking do.” She made sure to poke his chest hard with a finger at each word for extra emphasis.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy flinched back, scowling. “Are you seriously not coming back with me?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Nope,” Agatha replied, stepping around him. “Bigger fish to fry here! See ya never, Teen! Good luck finding your brother.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Billy groaned, throwing his hands in the air before taking off, flying straight up and out of the realm. His cape billowed dramatically as he disappeared into the swirling storm clouds.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sighed, rubbing her temples. “Dramatic little shit,” she muttered, before turning back toward the house.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The rain had stopped, but it was still cloudy. Agatha stood outside for a moment, staring at the heavy gray sky. The air was damp, clinging to her skin and hair, but it wasn’t the weather that made her hesitate.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage brushed past Rio without so much as a glance, her pace unrelenting. The tension between them hung heavy in the damp air, but Sage didn’t pause, didn’t care. Reaching the front door, she shoved it open with enough force to make it bounce against the wall, striding inside with purpose.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She made a sharp left into the living room, her black converse slapping against the floor. Without breaking her stride, she reached the window, her hand shooting out to grab the curtain. In one fluid motion, she yanked it back, sending the entire rod clattering to the floor with a crash.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The clearing outside came into view, her green eyes narrowing as she locked onto Agatha and Billy still standing out there, drenched but frozen in their conversation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her hand twitched at her side, faint sparks of grayish magic still flickering around her fingertips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Behind her, the house seemed to shudder with the echo of the rod hitting the ground, but Sage didn’t look back. She didn’t care if Rio had followed her inside or stayed outside. At that moment, her frustration consumed everything else.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“That curtain rod did nothing wrong to you, Petal,” Rio said calmly from behind her. The calm tone of her mother’s voice only made Sage’s jaw tighten further.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t turn around, her eyes still fixed on the two people outside. She could hear Rio’s soft footsteps crossing the room, followed by the familiar creak of the couch as she sat down. The sound grated against Sage’s already frayed nerves.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I wasn’t in the mood for it,” Sage muttered. Her hand flexed at her side, the residual sparks of magic finally fading as she forced herself to take a breath.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio hummed thoughtfully, the sound neither judgmental nor approving. “So, I take it you’re not in the mood for me, either?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s lips twitched into a faint scowl, but she still didn’t look back. “No, not particularly.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio leaned back, crossing her legs as the cushions shifted beneath her. “Good thing I’m not going anywhere, then.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s green eyes stared out the window, where Agatha and Billy were still visible in the distance. “They’re a waste of time,” Sage said finally, her voice even colder now. “All of this is.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio tilted her head, watching her carefully. “Funny thing about time,” she said softly. “We seem to have plenty of it, but you’re acting like you’re running out.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage froze at this. Her eyes flickered to the side, her chest rising and falling as she took a deep breath. “She’s gonna choose him,” she said, her voice quieter now. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t respond immediately, her gaze steady on Sage’s tense form. “And you’re jealous,” she said evenly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s jaw tightened, her hands still at her sides as her fingers flexed restlessly. “I’m not jealous.” she mumbled through gritted teeth, staring at the window as if it would give her answers. “I’m… realistic.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio raised an eyebrow, a faint smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. “Sure, Petal. That’s why you yanked the curtain rod off the wall like it personally offended you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You don’t get it. She’s already halfway out the door. She doesn’t need me. She never has.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> “You don’t need to be jealous,” Rio said calmly. “Not of him, not of anyone.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage snorted, crossing her arms. “The only thing I’m jealous of is y’all’s rendition of </span> <span class="s2">The Ballad of the Witches Road</span> <span class="s1">. Your outfits were fucking awesome.” </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio gave a small shrug, her voice still neutral, “Fair point. The outfits were good for what they were.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the faint smirk tugging at her lips. “Obnoxiously good. But this isn’t about your ability to coordinate lace and diamonds.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No, it’s not,” Rio said. “And it’s not about him, either.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s smirk vanished as her expression hardened again. Her eyes stayed on the figures in the front yard, rain streaking down the glass. “It’s not jealousy,” she said quietly. “It’s fact.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio pinched the bridge of her nose and let out a sigh. “Sage, she’s not choosing him over you. This isn’t a competition.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s shoulders tensed, her arms crossing tightly over her chest. “Feels like one. He’s what she’s used to. I’m just… here.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes softened, though her voice remained firm. “You’re her daughter. You don’t have to fight for her attention. You already have it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“That doesn’t mean anything. She doesn’t know how to stay.” Sage shook her head, frustration still clear in her features. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio leaned forward, resting her elbows on her knees, “Maybe. But if you keep pushing her away, you’re going to make it easier for her to go.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage stayed silent for a moment, “So what? I’m supposed to just apologize after what she said.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s voice was calm but edged with something deeper. “She said that because she was scared.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s fists clenched, and she turned to face Rio, her expression a mix of anger and uncertainty. “She said she’d hate me forever. That’s not fear. That’s-”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Exactly what she said to me,” Rio interrupted. “When I came to take Nicky the first time, she said the exact same words.” The words came out a whisper.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage froze, the retort on her tongue dying. “She said that… to you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio nods, “I carried it with me for centuries. Let it eat at me, let it shape the way I saw myself. And it didn’t fix anything. It didn’t change what I did or how much it hurt her.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s expression faltered, her defiance cracking just enough to let doubt seep in.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio leaned back and crossed her arms over her chest,“You think holding onto her words makes you stronger? It doesn’t. You’re not fixing anything by clinging to them like a weapon. All you’re doing is hurting the both of you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“She doesn’t deserve an apology.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio let out a heavy sigh, “She doesn’t deserve to carry the weight of your anger, either. You’re hurt, Petal, I get that. But lashing out doesn’t fix anything. Apologize.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">After a long silence, Sage shook her head. “Fine,” she muttered, heading toward the stairs to her bedroom. “But if she bites my head off, I’m blaming you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Wait,” Rio said, stopping her just as she reached the first step. Rio gets up off the couch and begins walking toward her. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage groaned, throwing her head back in frustration. “What now?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t answer. Instead, she stepped closer and tilted her head toward Sage, motioning with a slight nod. “Come here,” she said, her voice leaving no room for argument.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage narrowed her eyes and begrudgingly stepped closer. Before she could say anything, Rio licked her thumb and reached out to swipe it across the deep cut on Sage’s eyebrow.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hey!” Sage jerked back, smacking Rio’s hand away with a scowl. “What the hell? Quit!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio raised an eyebrow but didn’t respond, the faintest trace of amusement plays in her expression.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage crossed her arms tightly over her chest, glaring at her. “Eyebrow scars are fucking cool,” she mumbled. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s lips twitched, but she didn’t push the issue. Instead, she stepped back, watching as Sage turned and stomped up the stairs.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before stepping into the house, Agatha paused on the porch, staring at the closed door. She took a deep breath, the weight of her own actions settling heavily in her chest. She knew she’d screwed up. Those words never should’ve left her mouth, but in the heat of the moment, it was all she could think to say.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha exhaled slowly, her hand hovering over the doorknob. The tension in her chest only grew heavier the longer she stood there. She wanted to think of a plan, some way to make this easier, but nothing came. The truth was, she didn’t know how to fix this- not with Sage, not with Rio, not with any of it. She wasn’t sure if there </span> <span class="s2">was</span> <span class="s1"> a way to fix it.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her mind replayed the moment outside, the way Sage’s magic and anger had surged, wild and untamed. The words she’d thrown at her, sharp and cutting, came rushing back like a slap to the face.<em><br/></em></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><em>‘If you do this, I will hate you forever.</em>’ She hadn’t meant it, not really, but the look on Sage’s face told her it might not matter. She’d said it anyway, and now the damage was done.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha clenched her jaw, shame crawling up her spine. Her mother had always said cruel things to her. Genuinely the woman never had a nice thing to say. Only ever words meant to wound, to remind her of all the ways she’d fallen short. And it had worked. Those words had stuck, burrowing deep and shaping who Agatha became. She’d sworn that she would never be like that. Yet here she was, repeating the same damn pattern. She’d be damned if she let Sage carry those scars the way she had.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, pressing her palm flat against the doorframe. She was scared. That was the truth of it. She’d seen Sage losing control, and fear had taken over, clouding her thoughts and guiding her words. She hated that part of herself, the part that always lashed out when things got too hard or too real. It was easier to push people away than admit how much she cared.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her gaze dropped to the floor, her shoulders sagging under the weight of her own guilt. This was supposed to be different. Sage was supposed to be different. But here she was, repeating the same damn mistakes. She hadn’t been able to keep Nicky, she’d lost Rio for far longer than she’d care to admit. And now, the one person she wanted to protect more than anything was slipping through her fingers, and it was her fault.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The door loomed in front of her, but she knew she couldn’t stay out here forever.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With a shaky breath, Agatha opened the door. The house was quiet, the air inside heavy. The living room was empty, but when she glanced up the stairs, she noticed a faint light glowing from under Sage’s door. She hesitated, her gaze shifting down the hall to Rio’s closed door, dark and uninviting.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her chest tightened, and she exhaled slowly, forcing herself to stay calm. </span> <em> <span class="s2">One thing at a time,</span> </em> <span class="s1"> she told herself. She leaned slightly to get a better look at the hall, hoping it would offer her some sort of clarity.<br/><br/><br/></span></p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> It didn’t.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha took another steadying breath, her fingers twitching at her sides. </span> <span class="s2"><em>Sage first</em>,</span> <span class="s1"> she decided, straightening her shoulders. </span> <em> <span class="s2">Then Rio.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She started up the stairs, each step creaking slightly under her weight. Her pulse quickened the closer she got to Sage’s door.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha brought up a shaky hand to knock, her knuckles hovering just inches from the door. Before she could make contact, Sage’s voice called out from inside, “You can come in, you know! I can hear you hovering from here.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s lips twitched into the faintest smirk as she opened the door. Sage was sitting on her bed, propped against the wall with a book in her lap. She looked clean now, the dirt and blood gone, while Agatha still felt damp and wrung out from the rain.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She walked across the room and sank into the chair by Sage’s desk.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“A person is, among all else, a material thing, easily torn and not easily mended,”Sage said without looking up from her book.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Quoting </span> <em> <span class="s2">Atonement</span> </em> <span class="s1"> at me now? That supposed to be a dig?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage smirked faintly, closing the book and tossing it beside her. “Not everything’s about you, you know. It’s true. People are fragile.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sure. But some people are harder to break than others,” Agatha replied, leaning back in the chair.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“And some people,” Sage countered, her voice pointed, “are stubborn enough to make breaking them seem like a challenge.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tilted her head, watching her carefully. Sage’s words weren’t about their earlier fight, not directly, anyway. No, this felt bigger. Sage was talking about a bigger picture. About Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hm,” Agatha said, her lips curving into a small smile. “I wonder who you could possibly be talking about.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage returned the smile, “Take a wild guess.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha let the moment hang before exhaling. “I get your point. It’s easy to mess someone up. Fixing it? That’s the hard part. But you can try.” Her voice softened, and her gaze dropped to her hands. “Speaking of which… I’m… I’m </span> <span class="s1">sorry for what I said earlier.” The words flew out of her mouth so there was no possibility of taking them back.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage blinked, caught off guard. “Wait. Are you- did you just apologize?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Don’t make it weird,” Agatha grumbled, her cheeks faintly coloring as she looked away. “I don’t do this often.” She grunted out. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage leaned forward, studying Agatha with exaggerated scrutiny. “Wait.. Say that again for me, one more time.” Sage’s hands mimicked the motion of pulling out a camera as if she were recording the moment. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Don’t push it,” Agatha said, though her voice lacked its bite.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s lips twitched into a smile as she dropped her hands into her lap. “I’m sorry too. For, you know… trying to choke out Teen. I overdid it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha snorted, “That was little more than trying but I’ll take it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage shrugged but didn’t say anything else. The silence between them settled, not as heavy as before. Sage leaned back against the wall, her expression thoughtful. “What do you think about that quote? About people being fragile?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha considered her answer for a moment and then spoke, “I think it’s not just about being fragile. It’s about what happens after. How we put ourselves back together. Sometimes we do it on our own. Sometimes we need help. And sometimes… The scars stay. ” She paused, her voice quieter now. “Doesn’t mean we’re not worth the effort.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage studied her, her expression softening. “Are you talking about me, or are you talking about yourself?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re gonna have to figure that out yourself.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha was definitely talking about herself. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s lips twitched into a playful smile. She leaned forward again, as if she was about to share a deep dark secret. “That’s very poetic of you, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha groaned, slapped her knees, and pushed herself to her feet. “Okay, we’re done here.” Bringing the conversation to an abrupt end. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She started toward the door but hesitated, her hand resting on the knob. Slowly, she turned back around. “Are there any flowers in Rio’s garden that mean ‘Sorry I was acting like an ass’?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage grinned, swinging her legs off the bed. “Hydrangeas. Come on, I’ll show you where they are.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p>

<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The sun was setting now, casting a golden glow over the garden. The soft hues painted the sky, blending seamlessly with the vibrant colors that surrounded them. Sage led the way through the winding paths, their footsteps gentle against the cobblestone. A cool breeze rustled the leaves, carrying with it the faint scent of flowers, earthy and sweet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze swept over the garden. It wasn’t just beautiful, it was balanced. A mixture of nature and intention. For all her jagged edges, Rio had poured so much softness into this space, and it showed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha would never grow tired of this garden, no matter the time of day. Whether bathed in the golden light of morning, under the midday sun, or now, softened by the warmth of the sunset, it always felt like stepping into another world. A place of peace, yet full of vibrant life.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Rio’s done wonders with this place,” Agatha mumbled, unable to hide the awe in her voice.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage glanced back at her, the faintest hint of a smile tugging at her lips. “She doesn’t half ass anything,” she said. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">All Agatha could manage was a nod. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage stopped near the center of the garden, where the hydrangeas stood in clusters of pink, purple, and blue. “Here we are,” she said, motioning to the flowers. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The hydrangeas were all swaying gracefully in the light breeze. It was overwhelming, and Agatha didn’t know where to start.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage crouched beside the blooms, brushing her fingers lightly over a cluster of blue petals. “Blue. It symbolizes regret.” She pulled a small set of garden shears from her pocket and turned to hand them to Agatha. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha arched a brow. “Do you just carry those around with you everywhere?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage rolled her eyes and motioned for Agatha to take the shears.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“How do I do it?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage raised her eyebrows, her voice dripped in disbelief. “Has she not taught you how to do this?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had spent hours showing her how to tend to the garden, her voice calm and patient as she explained how to prune, water, and nurture each plant. Only one lesson had stuck and it had to do with white lilies and a heavy heart. The rest, Agatha had been far too distracted. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Distracted by the curve of Rio’s smile, the warmth in her voice, the way the sunlight caught her hair.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Distracted by the way she made tending the garden feel less like a chore and more like a ritual, a moment to breathe and be present.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Those are the feelings that had stayed with Agatha, which, unfortunately, didn’t leave much room for the finer details of Rio’s lessons.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I was… preoccupied,” Agatha finally admitted, her gaze shifting briefly to the side, avoiding the knowing look in Sage’s eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Preoccupied…” Sage repeated slowly, her eyebrows arching as a cheeky grin tugged at her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Do you want to help me or not?” Agatha shot back, a faint blush creeping up her cheeks.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Fine, here, take them.” Sage said, motioning again for Agatha to take the shears.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha took them cautiously, crouching down beside Sage. She glanced up at her expectantly, waiting for instructions.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Just cut at an angle, below the node. You’ll do fine.” Sage said, her tone bordering on impatient but not unkind. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha does as instructed, carefully cutting the hydrangea at an angle. She sets the shears down and holds the flower between her fingers, spinning it gently as she studies it. For a moment, she lets herself appreciate its beauty.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage stands and dusts off her hands with a satisfied nod. “I think you’ve got it handled from here. I’m gonna head back to my room,” she says, already turning toward the house.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As Sage begins to walk away, Agatha calls out, “Sage!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage stops and turns back, a questioning look on her face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Thank you,” Agatha says simply, hoping she makes it clear that she means every word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s expression softens, the teasing edge she usually carries gone. “You’re welcome,” she says, her voice quieter now, before continuing on her way back to the house.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha paced the guest bedroom, the hydrangea twisting between her fingers. Her heart raced, each step matched by the panicked thoughts in her head. She had no idea what to say or where to start. Apologizing wasn’t something she’d ever done, especially not with Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With Sage, it had been easier; they’d found a way to bridge their gaps through literature, shared moments where words came easier. But Rio was different. This felt way more overwhelming. She stopped her pacing, gripping the hydrangea tighter as she forced herself to breathe. She needed to do this. It mattered. Rio deserved this.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She glanced at the hydrangea, the feeling of it grounding her. She wasn’t just apologizing for the words she’d thrown at Sage. She was apologizing for the same words she’d once hurled at Rio, words she’d meant. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha closed her eyes, her jaw tightening as the memories clawed their way to the surface. She couldn’t take those words back, not ever. She couldn’t take back the life Rio never got to have with Nicky, the years stolen from them both. She couldn’t undo the centuries of emotional torment she had inflicted, running from her own pain and burying Rio in the fallout. She didn’t know if she had forgiven Rio yet, at least, not completely. The weight of losing a child was far too heavy to let go of entirely. But something had shifted in her time spent in Rio’s realm. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The chaos that had defined her for so long…. the grief that had shaped every decision, every breath…. It had begun to calm. It was subtle, a whisper instead of a scream, but it was there. She hadn’t realized how heavy her heart had been until she felt the absence of that weight. It wasn’t gone entirely, but here, it felt… manageable. That was a gift Rio and Sage had given her, one she wasn’t sure she deserved.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She stared at the hydrangea in her hand, the soft blue petals trembling slightly under her unsteady grip. It was a small gesture, she knew that. An apology for one wound among so many. But it was a start, and for the first time in what felt like an eternity, Agatha was ready to try.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha crossed the hall, stepping over Señor Scratchy, who had been freely roaming as if he owned the place. When she reached Rio’s door, knocking never even crossed her mind. Instead, she turned the handle and walked in, uninvited.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hadn’t been in this room since she’d started sleeping across the hall, and the sudden intimacy of being here again was almost overwhelming. It greeted her like a memory she hadn’t realized she’d been aching for.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And there she was.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio was lounging against the headboard, dressed in an old t-shirt with a faded graphic of Audrey II from </span> <span class="s2">Little Shop of Horrors</span> <span class="s1"> and a pair of worn sweatpants. Her hair fell naturally to her shoulders, those infuriatingly perfect curtain bangs framing her face. Her sketchbook rested in her lap, a pencil poised in her hand. She looked up at Agatha, startled, her brown eyes wide with surprise.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s lungs filled with an unrelenting gush of air. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Whatever carefully rehearsed words she’d planned to say disappeared in an instant. Agatha opened her mouth, but all that came out was a single, unguarded truth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re beautiful.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio blinked, the pencil slipping slightly in her grip. She stared at Agatha, stunned, her lips parting to respond but no sound came out. Her gaze flickered downward as she glanced at the sketchbook in her lap. For a beat, she stayed like that, her fingers brushing the edges of the paper, her brows furrowed in an expression somewhere between confusion and flattery.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio looked back up, her mouth opened again. But still, no words followed. It was rare to see Rio Vidal, the keeper of the balance, at a loss for words. But here the original green witch sat, visibly shaken by Agatha’s brutal honesty.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then her eyes flickered to the blue hydrangea dangling loosely from Agatha’s hand. Something in her face shifted- concern, surprise, maybe even something softer. Her gaze snapped back to Agatha, searching her face for answers.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without a word, Rio closed the sketchbook and set it on the nightstand. She cleared her throat and moved to sit cross legged. Her fingers fidgeted with the edge of her shirt. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha moved to Rio’s side of the bed, lowering herself cross legged to mirror the woman sitting across from her. Their knees slightly brushing. The space between them felt like the kind of distance words couldn’t easily bridge. Agatha spun the flower delicately between her fingers.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Can you tell me what that flower symbolizes?” Rio asked, her voice an only a whisper. The question felt deliberate, as though she needed confirmation. Like she had to be sure this wasn’t just some random flower Agatha had plucked without thought.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swallowed hard, her throat tight as she forced herself to meet Rio’s gaze, “Regret.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio exhaled, a shaky and uneven breath. “Okay,” she whispered. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Is that all you’re going to say?” Agatha’s voice cracked between frustration and desperation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio looked down at her hands, her fingers fidgeting in her lap. “What do you want me to say, Agatha? That I regret everything? That I carry it every day, every hour, until I can’t breathe?” She exhaled sharply, shaking her head. “Because I do. I always have.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Though the words were whispered, they might as well have been shouted into an endless forest, echoing hundreds of years of brutal sorrow and being on the receiving end of unforgiving silence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Oh.</span></em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hadn’t prepared for this. She had offered what was meant to be a symbol of her regret, an apology. But Rio didn’t see it that way. She didn’t see it as a gesture of remorse, not as Agatha taking a step toward mending what had been broken. Rio saw it as something else entirely. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">A pattern repeating itself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The flower wasn’t a bridge, it was a reminder. A thread woven into the same old tapestry of their history, where every hurt lingered unresolved, and every apology carried the shadow of justification. Agatha’s careless words to Sage had torn at wounds neither of them dared to admit were still there. Centuries of pain buried, but never healed. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was about the way Agatha had always bent their story to fit her own truth. Every argument, every disagreement, even before Nicky, had followed the same cycle. Agatha would twist the narrative, finding ways to make herself the victim or the righteous one, leaving Rio to bear the blame. It was never just one fight but the magnitude of them all. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And now, the flower felt like more of the same. Not an apology, but an expectation: that Rio would carry the weight of Agatha’s guilt, her regret, her need for absolution. That Rio would be the one to make peace.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">I…” Agatha started, but the words caught in her throat. She swallowed hard, “I didn’t mean-” She tried again, her voice trembling. “I-”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her words crumbled, a facade she spent centuries perfecting had completely shattered, as the sting of tears pricked her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swallowed hard, her fists clenched tightly in her lap, careful not to crush the flower in her grasp. It felt like she was waging a war within herself to summon the courage to speak. What finally gave her strength wasn’t some sudden burst of determination. It was the look in Rio’s eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They were filled with a heartbreak so deep it was suffocating, sore, and undeniable. Agatha felt it like a dagger to her chest. She was completely shattered by it, couldn’t handle the knowledge that she was the one who had caused it. She wouldn’t be that person anymore.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re right to be angry. About everything. About what I said to Sage. About what I’ve done to you for centuries.” Her voice cracked on the last word, but she forced herself to continue. “I didn’t bring this flower to absolve myself, Rio. I brought it because I didn’t know how else to say I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Based on the look on Rio’s face, she was stunned, and to be honest, so was Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What,” Rio whispered, her voice barely audible, as if she couldn’t quite process the moment.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swallowed hard, her voice trembling as she spoke. “I can’t pretend I understand why it all had to happen the way it did. I don’t. And I don’t know if I ever will.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She to a deep quivering breath before she continued, “I don’t know how to separate it, Rio. What happened. What you did. Who you are.” Her fingers tightened around the hydrangea’s stem, her knuckles white as the petals quivered under her grip. “It’s all so tangled, and I don’t know how to pull it apart.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> Rio flinched, the tension in her shoulders betraying the calm she tried to maintain. But she didn’t interrupt, didn’t move. She didn’t try to explain or defend herself. She just listened.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s tears started to fall, warm and unrestrained. Her voice cracked under the pressure of her grief. “I fell asleep holding him. And he died in my arms. When I woke up, he was gone.” Her grip on the flower stem trembled as she forced herself to continue. “You walked him, didn’t you? While I was asleep. You took him. You didn’t even let me-“</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I didn’t choose for him to die, Agatha,” Rio said softly, her voice calm but heavy with emotion. “I didn’t choose when it happened. I only chose to be there. Because he was my son, and I loved him.” There was no anger in her tone, only quiet conviction. “I gave him everything I could.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze, her grip tightening on the flower as Rio’s words sank in. She opened her mouth to protest, to push back, but no argument came. Instead, her shoulders sagged with the burden of a truth she had refused to face. Her voice wavered, as the words slipped out. “He had always been our son.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s expression shifted, her posture loosening. A single tear slid down her cheek but she stayed quiet, letting the meaning of Agatha’s words linger in the space between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For the first time since his birth and his death, Agatha had spoken the words out loud, releasing the lie she had clung to for centuries, the lie she had wielded as a shield for herself and a weapon against Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swiped at her cheeks with the back of her free hand, her shaky fingers still clutching the flower. “It doesn’t make it easier,” she whispered. “It doesn’t make it hurt any less.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No,” Rio replied gently, her voice still calm. “It doesn’t.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The silence between them was delicate, like standing on unsteady ground. Agatha’s grip on the flower loosened, her hands trembling as she stared down at its petals. It felt so heavy, but also strangely lighter, as though sharing the burden made it just a little easier to carry.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t forgiveness, and it wasn’t peace. But it was another acknowledgment, a step toward understanding.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio reached out a tentative hand, hovering in the space between them. She hesitated, her fingers curling slightly as though bracing for rejection, but before she could pull away, Agatha caught her hand and gently guided it to her cheek. The warmth of Agatha’s skin under her palm stilled Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha set the hydrangea down carefully beside her, her other hand reaching for Rio’s. She placed it on her other cheek, letting Rio cradle her face, their connection quiet but deeply intimate. Rio’s thumbs moved softly, brushing away the tear streaks that marred Agatha’s face, her touch tender. Slowly, Rio leaned forward until their foreheads rested together. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio nudged her nose against Agatha’s, a silent question. Agatha answered by pressing her lips to Rio’s, the kiss soft and still, unmoving but heavy with meaning. It tasted of salt and tears, but it was honest in a way words couldn’t be. It spoke of emotions they weren’t strong enough to say out loud. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Agatha finally pulled away, her hands on Rio’s wrist and her voice was barely above a whisper. “Can I stay with you tonight?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Of course,” Rio didn’t hesitate.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And just like that, the space between them dissolved, leaving only the beginnings of something that felt so much like hope.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s hands stayed on Agatha’s face, her palms warm against her skin. One hand moved first, her fingers dragging gently down, tracing the curve of her cheek as though she were trying to make sure she was real. The other hand followed, sliding softly down the side of Agatha’s head, her touch was so gentle, before settling at the back of her head.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio leaned forward, pulling her into an embrace, cradling Agatha even as she brought her closer. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let herself be held, her hands finding Rio’s waist as her head rested against Rio’s shoulder. The tension in her body eased slightly, her fingers curling loosely into the fabric of Rio’s shirt as the silence wrapped around them, heavy but not unwelcome.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Later, they lay side by side in bed, the soft glow of the TV illuminating the room. The quiet sounds of </span> <span class="s2">The Real Housewives of New York City</span> <span class="s1"> filled the air, a strangely comforting backdrop to their shared silence. Agatha’s head rested against Rio’s shoulder, the weight of Rio’s arm draped lightly over her waist. For a moment, everything felt still, even peaceful, as they sank into the trivial drama of a world that wasn’t their own.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then Rio shifted slightly, her hand brushing against Agatha’s, and in the softest tone, she mentioned it: Sage’s birthday was in two days. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That meant the anniversary of Nicky’s death was tomorrow.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s body tensed, the words crashing into her like a speeding bus. She held her breath and her eyes slammed shut, preparing for the inevitable blow. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her chest tightened, but it wasn’t the same visceral, suffocating grief she used to feel. It wasn’t the uncontrollable storm that had once torn through her, leaving her gasping and disoriented. It wasn’t the kind of pain that left her an outsider to her own body, paralyzed as memories ravaged her from the inside out. No, this was quieter, almost subtle. It sat there, pressing heavily against her ribcage, but it didn’t scream or thrash.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It felt manageable in a way that frightened her. The absence of that feral ache made her stomach twist. She knew this didn’t mean she’d forgotten Nicky or that her grief had disappeared, but the stillness of it made her feel out of place. Like she was betraying him by not falling apart.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The feeling shifted again, and she found herself sinking into something different. It wasn’t the chaos of past years; it was the slow, unrelenting pull of quiet sorrow, seeping into every corner of her mind. It filled her with a hollow kind of ache, one that left her staring blankly at the screen, hearing the distant sounds of the show but not absorbing a word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She didn’t move. Her breathing remained steady, but the grief wound itself tighter and tighter inside her chest. She felt small, impossibly small, like her own body couldn’t hold the enormity of what she had lost. Yet there was no panic, no thrashing need to escape. Just the inescapable truth of what tomorrow would bring, settling over her like a shadow she couldn’t outrun.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t sleep that night, and neither did Rio. When dawn broke, Agatha reached for Rio’s hand, squeezing it gently. Blue eyes met brown, a silent plea to tend Nicky’s memorial together, as they have before.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes fluttered closed for a moment, and when she opened them again, her voice spoke quietly. “Sage and I do it together every year on this day.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt Rio’s words wrap around her like a rope tightening around her body, pulling her inward until it felt like she might fold completely into herself. She needed this, needed to grieve with Rio, needed that connection, but she couldn’t bring herself to take Rio away from Sage. Not today. Not when she imagined two centuries of them mourning, year after year, a son and a brother who was no longer here.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before the ache could fully swallow her, Rio continued, her voice steady but tender. “But I think you should do it with her this morning. And later… we can take a moment. Just the two of us, if you want.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha nodded faintly, though she couldn’t quite bring herself to meet Rio’s gaze. The idea of sharing that moment with Sage, just the two of them, should have been comforting. Rather, it left her feeling hollow, as if there was too much of her grief to contain and no way to truly share it with someone who wasn’t Rio. She hated how much she wanted that moment with Rio, how selfish it felt to even consider stepping into the space Sage had filled for so many years.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She let her head drop against the pillow, her fingers loosening their hold on Rio’s hand but not fully letting go. Rio didn’t pull away. Instead, she shifted closer, her body warm beside Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For now, it was the quiet strength in Rio’s presence, the faint pressure of her hand was enough to keep her breathing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t long before Agatha met Sage out on the patio, Rio silently staying behind in the house. Sage was seated in her usual chair at the table, the sky overcast despite the rising sun. She looked up, her eyes wide with surprise and concern, but she didn’t say anything. Agatha gave a small nod toward the willow tree across the garden, a quiet gesture for Sage to follow.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Above them, the clouds shifted slowly, letting the sun’s light press through in gentle streaks, as though the rainclouds and sunlight were engaged in a struggle for control of the morning sky.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha moved ahead of Sage, as they crossed the garden toward the willow tree. She didn’t need to look back to know Sage was following; the sound of her footsteps was enough. The morning air was cool, filled with the faint scent of rain, and the soft rustle of leaves filled the silence between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When they reached the memorial, Sage didn’t hesitate. She knelt by the stone with a familiarity that spoke to years of tending it, her hands brushing away leaves and debris from the base. Agatha stood for a moment, watching, unsure of where she fit into this tradition that clearly already belonged to Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Slowly, she sank to her knees beside her. Sage didn’t look up, her focus on her work, but she shifted slightly, making room for Agatha as though she had always been part of this moment. Together, they worked in silence, clearing the space with careful, practiced movements. Agatha’s hands moved with less certainty than Sage’s, but she didn’t mind it, she even found some comfort in it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When the area was cleared, Agatha motioned for Sage to follow her toward the white lilies nearby. Sage stepped forward first, she crouched and selected three flowers. She pulled shears out her pocket. She mumbled, “You never know when someone might need a lesson in basic gardening,” as her fingers brush over each lily before carefully trimming them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could almost feel the tug of her lips at the girl’s comment and the memory from the night before, but nothing came of it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage stood and turned to Agatha, handing her the tool with a single nod. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitated for a moment before kneeling and choosing her own three flowers. She worked with care, trimming the stems. When she stood, Sage extended her own bundle of three flowers to her without a word. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Back at the memorial, they both knelt before the stone. Sage looked up at Agatha, a flicker of panic flashing in her green eyes. It was subtle, but Agatha caught the realization that Sage didn’t have the braided twine. Rio always carried it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had handed her the twine earlier, before she had joined Sage on the patio. Her touch lingering for just a second longer than necessary. Agatha reached into her pocket and pulled out the familiar strands, braided tightly in purple, green, and black. These colors had always been used.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Agatha’s hands moved to tie the bouquet, her fingers deft from weeks of practice, but today they trembled uncontrollably. She clenched her teeth, trying to steady herself, but the twine slipped once, then twice. She froze, her frustration intensifying.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage shifted closer, her hand reaching out to rest gently atop Agatha’s quivering ones. Agatha paused. Sage’s hand lingered just long enough to ease the tension, then moved to guide the twine with her. Together, their fingers worked through it, until the braided twine secured the bouquet in place.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">When it was done, Sage pulled her hands back, sitting quietly as Agatha adjusted the flowers on top of the stone. Her </span> <span class="s1">fingers traced the engraved lyrics</span> <span class="s1">, her touch lingering on the line Rio had changed: </span> <em> <span class="s2">your mothers love you </span> <span class="s2">so</span> <span class="s2">.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Before Agatha could dwell on the thought, Sage’s voice broke the silence, “In the darkness of my dark-beating heart, I know. He’d have loved it, all right. You see? Even death has a heart.”</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>Agatha froze, her fingers lingering on the stone. The words were from The Book Thief, a story narrated by Death itself. Hearing Sage speak them was a truth carving its place in Agatha’s heart, refusing to leave.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t just someone who grieved Nicky. Rio was Death, the one who had walked Nicky across the threshold, who had been there when Agatha couldn’t. For years, she had blamed Rio for what had happened, had resented her for what felt like a betrayal. But the words stayed, their truth undeniable.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Death had a heart. And Rio’s had broken too.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage stood quietly, brushing the dirt from her knees. She didn’t linger, didn’t speak again, only turned and walked back toward the house, leaving Agatha alone at the memorial. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha remained kneeling, her eyes locked on the engraved lyrics and the braided twine. The heaviness in her chest wasn’t as piercing as it had been, but it didn’t feel any easier to carry. It lingered, an unforgiving grip that refused to loosen its hold, but even if only in this moment, it seemed as if she could breathe through it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">After a while, Agatha returned to the house. As she stepped through the door, the sky seemed to shift. Heavy clouds rolled back in, relentless as ever. She had crossed paths with Rio briefly in the hallway. Rio had handed her a cup of coffee as she made her way toward the garden. Rio’s brown eyes had carried a mix of sadness and admiration, a discreet pride in Agatha for braving the day with them all together.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio leaned in, giving Agatha the space to retreat if she needed. Agatha didn’t. Rio closed the gap, pressing a soft, gentle kiss to Agatha’s cheek before continuing on to the garden. Agatha stood there for a moment, the warmth of the kiss lingering against her skin.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha walked into the living room. She reached for the familiar box from the entertainment center drawer. Without a thought, she made her way up the stairs and knocked softly on Sage’s door.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s footsteps grew closer before the door creaked open. When it did, Agatha was met with a look in Sage’s green eyes that struck her. It was far less vibrant than usual, distant, even. Agatha lifted the box slightly, arching a brow in silent question. Sage gave a slight nod, her expression unreadable, and followed Agatha back downstairs, closing the door behind her without a word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Outside, the sky was still heavy with clouds, but the sun made an attempt to push through, its rays faint but insistent. Agatha and Sage settled into their familiar game. They hadn’t exchanged a single word. Sage won every round, but Agatha barely noticed. Her attention was drawn upward, to the battle unfolding in the sky. Dark clouds clashed against the sun in an endless war.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As the hours passed and the morning gave way to afternoon, Agatha noticed the change in Sage. It wasn’t just grief; it was deeper. Her eyes were dimmer, her cheeks beginning to hollow, and her shoulders sagged with exhaustion. It reminded her of what Rio looked like after a job. The way Death’s work left a mark that was not only physical but also a weariness of the soul.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s heart tightened as she looked between the two conflicting forces above-sun and clouds at war- and then back to Sage. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The realization hit Agatha hard and severe.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage wasn’t just sad. She was fighting. Fighting her sadness and her guilt as a child born from death. Sage was battling to bring light into a day heavy with grief and shadows, sacrificing her own peace, her own tranquility, just to offer Agatha a fleeting moment of warmth. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s chest ached at the thought. Sage wasn’t just offering her a distraction. She was trying to give Agatha some peace, sacrificing her own in the process. The clouds have been relentless, the sun’s light trying to persevere. With everything she had, Sage was trying to bring light to Agatha’s darkest day.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For whatever reason, these people- despite her past mistakes, despite the ways she had hurt them or the cruel words she’d thrown- had chosen her. They sacrificed their own peace, stood by her through every storm she created, and still every day, they chose Agatha. It was always a choice made without hesitation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">How ironic it was that in death, she had experienced more life than she ever had on the surface.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The thought filled her lungs with so much air, she couldn’t find it in herself to feel guilty about the weight of anything else.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha caught Rio’s gaze across the garden and tilted her head toward the patio, gesturing to the chair beside them. Without wavering, Rio set down her gardening tool, brushed the dirt from her hands, and disappeared inside. A few minutes later, she returned, her hair tied back, her face clean, ready to join Agatha and Sage at the table.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio sat quietly at first, observing the game of chess unfolding between them. After a few rounds, Rio leaned forward, frowning at a move Agatha had made. Without asking, she nudged the piece back and moved another in its place.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“That’s not how it works,” Agatha said, narrowing her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“It is now,” Rio replied, unapologetic.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The silence that had settled over the garden broke with small comments and suggestions. Rio and Agatha became a team, united in their attempt to beat Sage. The air grew lighter with fleeting laughter and small smiles exchanged between moves. Even the sky above mirrored the shift, with lingering gray clouds clearing to reveal rays of sunshine.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s eyes looked lighter, her face filling out with every passing moment.  She looked more like herself than she had all day. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">During one particularly tense game, Rio leaned back in her chair, arms crossed, brimming with confidence. “We’re gonna win.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’ve said that three times already,” Agatha replied dryly, not looking up.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“This time, I mean it,” Rio said. “And I’m so sure of it, I’m willing to bet on it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That perked Sage’s interest immediately. Her wicked smirk spread slowly across her face, her tongue pressing into her cheek as she leaned forward, resting her elbows on the table. The excitement radiating from her was almost palpable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Sage could speak, Agatha cut her off, her gaze darting to Rio. “Of all the expressions she could’ve inherited from you, it had to be that one.” She gestured toward Sage’s smirk. “The one that always pissed me off the most.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>Rio held her hands up in mock innocence, her lips pressed tightly together as if to stifle a grin, fighting the urge to mirror the expression. Despite her effort, Agatha could see the faint outline of her tongue pressing against the inside of her cheek.<br/><br/></p><p>Agatha ignored it and tilted her head slightly, her eyes narrowing as she fixed them on Sage. “So, what’s your wager?” she asked, her voice edged with challenge.</p><p> </p><p class="p1">Sage’s grin spread instantly. Without missing a beat, she replied, “Let’s make it a true Daily Double, Alex.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio groaned, leaning back in her chair, “If you think she’s insufferable during chess, try watching an episode of </span> <span class="s2">Jeopardy </span> <span class="s1">with her.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I’d rather sit in a locked room with my mother.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Same,” Rio muttered, the corners of her lips twitching.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage ignored them entirely, her attention still fixed on Agatha. “If I win, I want to see the ocean. Specifically, I want to go whale watching.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>Agatha’s head shot up, and she bit back the groan rising in her throat. She knew exactly where this conversation was headed.</p><p> </p><p class="p1">“I don’t see the issue,” Rio said with a shrug.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m not done,” Sage added, her grin turning down right shit eating. “There’s a nonnegotiable: </span> <span class="s2">You</span> <span class="s1">,” she pointed a finger directly at Agatha. “Are coming.” She turned to Rio, the back of her hand covering her mouth with a theatrical whisper, loud enough for Agatha to hear. “We have some unfinished business with the sea.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio raised an amused eyebrow, but Sage wasn’t done. “All of us. Tomorrow. Family vacation!” She practically sang the last two words.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha crossed her arms, tossing her head back with an exasperated groan. The word </span> <span class="s2">family</span> <span class="s1"> poked at something inside her that made her flinch. Still, when Rio cast her a questioning glance, she threw up her hands in resignation. There was no real anger in the gesture, just the quiet acceptance that they were doing this.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“If that’s what you want, Petal,” Rio said softly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hell yes!” Sage shouted, slamming her fists on the table with so much enthusiasm it made both Rio and Agatha jump.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“All right, relax,” Rio said, shaking her head.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They returned to the game and of course, they lost.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Later, Rio and Agatha lay side by side in the grass beneath the willow tree. The branches swayed gently above them, their hands loosely entwined between them. No words were spoken. They didn’t need to be.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">By the end of the night, they were all piled in the living room, watching an episode of </span> <span class="s2">Jeopardy.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had been right. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p>Sage was more insufferable than she’d been at chess, effortlessly answering every question with ease like she had written the questions herself. </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha glanced at Rio, who was leaning against her shoulder with a sigh. “How do you live with her?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s lips quirked into a smile. “I ask myself that every day.”<br/><br/><br/></span>

<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha shoved clothes into her duffel bag with barely contained annoyance. Three days. Their trip to the ocean wasn’t just a day out, but a full three day excursion. She groaned at the thought. Of course, Rio had dropped that little detail casually earlier that morning, coffee in hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha had been propped against the headboard, Sage’s book open in her lap, when Rio breezed into the guest bedroom. Without so much as a preamble, Rio perched on the edge of the bed, handed Agatha her coffee, and, with that maddening calm of hers, mentioned the extended trip. Before Agatha could even form a response, Rio leaned in, pressed a kiss to her cheek, and strolled out of the room, leaving Agatha completely dumbfounded.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Now, the bag zipped shut, Agatha hefted it over her shoulder and stepped out of the bedroom. She made her way to the living room, dropping the bag beside the couch before flopping onto the cushions with an exaggerated sigh. Crossing her arms, settling in to wait for Rio and Sage, her irritation still simmering. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio appeared in the living room first, duffel bag in hand, along with a purse that immediately caught Agatha’s attention. Rio was not a purse person, and Agatha made a mental note to ask about it later. In her other hand was a travel cup, but it wasn’t the items Rio carried that made Agatha pause. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was wearing jeans and an oversized black shirt that read “everyone watches women’s sports,” paired with a neon orange WNBA baseball cap and white sneakers that looked far cleaner than the ones she wore in her garden. Agatha’s mind froze at the sight, her breath catching in her throat. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could have jumped her right then and there. She even swiped at her chin to make sure she wasn’t drooling.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio set her duffel bag down next to Agatha’s and motioned for her to move over. Agatha obliged without a word, moving to make space. Rio dropped onto the couch beside her, sitting close enough that their legs touched. She placed the purse on Agatha’s lap.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">That makes more sense. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Though the gesture was simple, it made Agatha’s heart soar. Of course, she pretended that it didn’t.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio adjusted her position and reached into her back pocket, struggling for a moment before pulling out a wallet. She handed it to Agatha, who didn’t need to open it to know whose it was. Rio wanted her to carry it for her. Agatha rolled her eyes but said nothing, placing the wallet inside the purse before setting it on the floor at her feet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Once she settled, Rio handed her the travel cup. Agatha accepted it, their fingers brushing briefly. The moment the cup left Rio’s hand, her palm fell to rest on Agatha’s thigh. It was a casual touch, clearly unintentional, but Agatha still felt the heat rising low in her belly. Trying to distract herself, she took a sip from the cup and found that it was coffee. Of course it was. Rio always knew exactly what she needed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was testing her patience. One more sweet gesture or misplaced hand, and Agatha was ready to throw caution aside entirely and pounce on her like a feral cat in heat. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You look good,” Agatha said, her voice calm despite the turmoil in her head. She set the cup on the coffee table, noticing that Rio’s hand hadn’t moved. Agatha leaned back to study her, and Rio gave a small smile in return, her brown eyes shining with a warmth that felt blinding.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha crossed her arms, resisting the urge to pull Rio closer and ruin that smile. Not that she would ruin it. More likely she would trace it, taste it, maybe bite it if she were feeling particularly reckless. She bit the inside of her cheek to keep those thoughts at bay.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She needed a distraction. “Since when are you a fan of sports?” she asked, though she was aware her eyes hadn’t moved from Rio’s mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She realized the second Rio caught her staring. The small, sweet smile twisted into something undeniably smug, and Agatha’s heart skipped a beat.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before speaking, Rio licked her bottom lip and tugged it into her mouth. The sight alone was enough to draw a soft hum from Agatha before Rio even had a chance to respond. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“The day was January twenty-seventh, nineteen seventy-five,” Rio said, her tone carrying a teasing lilt. “The first nationally televised women’s college basketball game.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could not have cared less about the answer. All she could think about was the way Rio’s lips moved when she spoke.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> <em>Caution be damned.</em><br/></span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><br/>Agatha grabbed Rio by the collar of her t-shirt and pulled her into a kiss that was as forceful as it was inevitable. Rio, as though anticipating it, reached up just in time to tilt her hat back, ensuring it wouldn’t get in the way.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When their lips met, it was far from gentle. There was no slow buildup, no tentative exploration, only an explosion of unrestrained hunger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Their mouths parted instantly, tongues colliding in a heated battle for control, each desperate to claim the other.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s grip tightened on Rio’s shirt, pulling her even closer. Rio responded just as eagerly. One hand sliding to Agatha’s waist while the other anchored at the nape of her neck, gripping her firmly as if to remind her that there was no escape, not that Agatha wanted one. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t a kiss meant to convey tenderness or sweetness. It was a kiss that demanded everything, and both were all too willing to give.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha conceded to Rio. Rio happily slipped her tongue deeper, sweeping it along Agatha’s with slow, deliberate strokes that sent a wave of heat rushing through her body. Agatha answered with equal fervor, sucking lightly on Rio’s tongue befor- </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">BANG!</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The sound of Sage’s door slamming open upstairs made them fly apart like guilty teenagers caught sneaking a smooch. Rio immediately adjusted the cap on her head, crossing her arms. With one hand, she wiped her mouth with an open palm, either drying the wetness or attempting to make her lips look less red and swollen. Agatha wasn’t sure which, but watching Rio try to undo the evidence only made her want to ruin it all over again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before either could speak, a series of thuds and clattering noises erupted from upstairs. They turned toward the sound just in time to see a fully packed suitcase careening down the stairs, bumping and sliding before crashing into the front door.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Brucie slithered down the railing with far more grace, landing on the floor and disappearing somewhere into the house like she couldn’t be bothered by Sage’s havoc. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage followed, her black converse stomping loudly with every step. When she hit the last stair, she threw her arms wide, shouting, “Alright, ladies, who’s ready for the Vidal-Harkness family vacation 2024? Let’s fucking go!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Neither Rio nor Agatha responded. They remained frozen on the couch, blinking at Sage in dumbfounded silence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage strode into the room wearing her usual converse and jeans with a t-shirt that boldly read </span> <span class="s2">VIDAL-HARKNESS FAMILY VACATION 2024,</span> <span class="s1"> complete with blown up pictures of all three of their faces. She proudly held up a two folded shirts. “I made t-shirts,” she announced, grinning like she had just won an award.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At the same time, Rio and Agatha finally found their voices.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I wish I stayed buried,” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Did you pack for an entire football team?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage stared at them both, unimpressed. “Oh, come on. This is going to be </span> <span class="s2">fun!</span><span class="s1">” she insisted, holding up the t-shirts with more enthusiasm than either woman could fathom. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I’m not wearing that,” Agatha shot back immediately, arms crossed tightly over her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Yeah, Petal. As much as I love the shirts, you need to change,” Rio added, her voice calm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What? Why?” Sage asked, her expression shifting into an exaggerated pout.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio tilted her head, lips twitching as though fighting back a laugh. “Well, Agatha’s… pissed off a lot of people. And I mean, <em>a </em></span> <em> <span class="s2">lot</span> </em> <span class="s1"> of people.” Rio’s eyes widen at the second ‘a lot’. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I think she gets it,” Agatha cut in sharply, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio continued, “And we don’t really want to draw attention to that. Matching t-shirts with her face plastered on them might not help.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Fine,” Sage relented far too easily, earning a pair of surprised looks from both Rio and Agatha. “I figured you’d say that, which is why I also brought three sets of matching pajama pants in my suitcase.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha groaned loudly, dragging a hand down her face. “Of course you did.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sweet,” Rio sang, already on her feet and reaching out to grab two of the shirts from Sage with far too much enthusiasm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage grabbed the hem of her </span> <span class="s2">Vidal-Harkness Family Vacation 2024</span> <span class="s1"> shirt and yanked it over her head, revealing a plain black t-shirt underneath. She balled up the offending shirt. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Are y’all ready to go?” Sage asked, making her way to the foyer to and shoved the shirt into the top of her suitcase. She dragged the suitcase into the living room with unnecessary force, the wheels clattering against the floor.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stood, moving to stand near Rio as Sage bustled around, gathering their things at lightning speed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage was anything but delicate. She grabbed both of their duffel bags and threw them unceremoniously at her suitcase. Then she picked up Agatha’s travel cup and purse and shoved them into her arms. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Have been for an hour,” Agatha muttered, monotone, slightly taken aback by Sage’s haste as she adjusted the purse on her shoulder.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage ignored her, reaching into the back pocket of her jeans and pulling out a wallet. She handed it to Agatha, who took it without hesitation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Guess I’ll just be responsible for everyone’s shit then,” Agatha grumbled, unzipping the purse to toss the wallet inside.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Alright, then let’s do this,” Sage announced, raising a hand to conjure a portal. Before she could, Agatha stopped her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Wait!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage turned, confusion flashing across her face. Agatha cast a glance toward Rio, who wore the same puzzled expression.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“When we go back,” Agatha began, hesitating for a moment, “am I still going to look like this? Or, you know, translucent?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Both Sage and Rio’s expressions softened, making Agatha scoff and cross her arms over her chest, trying to shield herself from them burrowing deeper into her heart. Not that it mattered. They were already in far too deep. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Your physical form was manifested in my realm by Sage,” Rio explained, her voice reassuring. “Originally, that tethered you to her. I’ve adjusted it, so now you’re tethered to my realm instead. And since Sage was the one who brought you here, she can loan your form a tether to the surface, independent of herself.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha nodded slowly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage clapped her hands together, her excitement returning in full force. “Alright, now that’s settled, let’s fucking move!” She conjured the portal with a flick of her wrist, dramatically kicking her suitcase through before stepping in herself without so much as a look back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stayed rooted in place, staring at the swirling energy. She didn’t move.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You scared?” Rio nudged her gently, a soft smile tugging at her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Nope.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You gonna run?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I might.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They both knew she wouldn’t. Agatha was here, and for better or worse, she was staying. Stuck with them. And they were stuck with her. It wasn’t obligation; it was choice. A choice Agatha would make every day for as long as she could. Especially if it meant getting to see the gap between Rio’s teeth every time she smiled, big and unfiltered. Exactly like she was doing now. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio crouched down, carefully unzipping her duffel and refolded each t-shirt before placing them neatly inside. Once finished, she straightened up and turned to Agatha. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Silently, she reached for Agatha’s wrist, and as she did, she flipped her baseball cap backward with confident ease, clearing her face for easy access before tugging Agatha until their bodies were flush. Her other hand came up to cup Agatha’s cheek, guiding her in for a kiss.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This kiss was different from their last. It wasn’t rushed; it was deliberate, almost reverent. Their mouths moved slowly, savoring each moment. Agatha’s tongue brushed lightly against Rio’s bottom lip, a soft request for more. Rio granted it immediately, letting Agatha explore with languid strokes of her tongue. The warmth and tenderness of it sent shivers down Agatha’s spine, but just as she leaned in to further deepen it, Rio pulled away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The look in Rio’s brown eyes was enough to make Agatha’s knees nearly buckle. It was soft, unguarded, and something else that made Agatha’s chest tighten. For one breathless moment, she thought Rio might say it. She wasn’t sure if she wanted her to or if she really, <em>really</em> fucking wanted her to, but it hovered unspoken between them, waiting for Rio to hurry up and spit the three words out. The three words that rhymed all too well with </span> <span class="s2">pie dove boo.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But then Rio stepped back, adjusting her backward hat back with a small shake of her head, as if clearing her thoughts. She cleared her throat and looked up at Agatha with her big, beautiful brown eyes. She smiled, but it didn’t quite reach, leaving Agatha wondering what was holding her back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Ready?” Rio asked softly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“As I’ll ever be,” Agatha replied, her voice steady, though her heart was anything but.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio nodded and bent to pick up both their bags with one hand like it was nothing. The movement made the veins in her hand and forearm stand out, drawing Agatha’s attention in a way she’d never admit aloud. She let out an audible groan, earning her a smirk- the one Rio had perfected long ago, with her tongue pressing into her cheek like she knew </span> <span class="s2">exactly</span> <span class="s1"> what she was doing.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage might have picked it up along the way, but it never quite had the same charm as when Rio did it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And Agatha fucking hated it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Maybe.</span></em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With a playful bend of her knees, Rio motioned toward the portal with her free hand. “After you, Ma’lady,” she teased.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha rolled her eyes, muttering something under her breath, but stepped toward the portal nonetheless, her pulse thrumming and her mind stuck on the kiss. And, much to her dismay, on how stupidly hot Rio looked holding both their bags or when her baseball cap was sitting backward like she’d done it just to drive Agatha insane.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, Agatha found herself standing in a parking lot in the middle of what looked like some backwater town. Cars were scattered across the cracked asphalt, and there was no beach in sight. Before she could process her frustration, Rio came barreling through the now-vanished portal, slamming into Agatha’s back and making her stumble forward.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Agatha turned to throw Rio a glare, Rio was already mid apology, hands raised in a sheepish gesture. Agatha ignored her entirely, spinning instead toward Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage wasn’t even facing them. She was standing in front of an old green Subaru Forester, her body flush against it. She focused entirely on the car.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Where’s the </span> <span class="s2">fucking</span> <span class="s1"> beach?” Agatha shouted. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage didn’t jump from the sound of Agatha’s outburst, but her abrupt movement made a sharp pop echo</span> <span class="s1"> through the lot. Agatha watched as something clattered to the ground- a stretched out metal hanger?</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without answering, Sage popped the car door open with ease and started rummaging through the middle console. “Fuck!” she yelled, voice dripping with irritation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, as if this were the most normal thing in the world, Sage pressed a button, and the sound of the trunk popping open followed. She muttered to herself as she dragged her suitcase toward the back of the car. “Who keeps spare keys in the middle console? I wanted to hotwire this shit.” With a huff, she tossed her suitcase into the trunk.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha blinked, realization hitting her like a brick to the back of the head. Sage was stealing a car.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What the fuck are you doing?” Agatha demanded, her voice filled with disbelief.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage startled slightly, her green eyes widening for a brief moment before she turned to look at Agatha. Recognition softened her expression almost immediately. “Stealing a car,” she said matter of factly, as though the question didn’t deserve to be asked. With a casual shrug, she added, “I read about how to hotwire a car in a book the other day and wanted to try it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stared at her, struggling to process the sheer absurdity of the situation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Nice color,” Rio said, strolling past Agatha without a care in the world. She walked straight to the back of the car, tossed their bags into the trunk, and slammed it shut.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Dusting her hands off, she turned to Sage, her expression unbothered. “Whose is it?” she asked, as if stealing a car was just another part of their vacation itinerary.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Some homophobic prick,” Sage said with a shrug. “I met his daughter at one of the lectures I’ve been to. Oh! Can I drive? Please, please, please?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Hearing that, Agatha wasn’t pissed anymore. Instead, she chimed in, “Did anyone tell him he drives the car that every lesbian in America owns? Also, in the world’s gayest color?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage burst into laughter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smirked, but her tone turned suspicious. “Do you even know how to drive?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The question made both Rio and Sage freeze. They slowly turned their heads to look at each other, an unspoken conversation passing between them, before they turned back to Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Yes,” Rio said, a little too quickly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Yup,” Sage echoed with far too much enthusiasm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Well, that didn’t sound confident.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With that settled (or not) they all piled into the car. Before they could leave, Rio waved a hand, using her magic to change the license plate and forge new registration documents. “There. No arrests today, ladies.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha climbed into the back seat without argument. She’d already decided she couldn’t handle the stress of sitting up front and having a clear view of Sage’s driving. Some things were better left unseen as her blood pressure was already through the fucking roof from literally everything that’s already happened today. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha watched as Rio’s hands flew to her seatbelt, yanking it on with urgency. Noticing Rio’s fervor, Agatha did the same, her fingers fumbling slightly as she buckled herself in.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage started the car, her movements efficient as she entered an address into the GPS suction cupped to the windshield. Then, without warning, she began violently flipping through radio stations, finally landing on a song about supernovas and red wine. The music blared through the speakers, loud enough to rattle the car windows.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Grinning to herself, Sage put the car into drive and hit the gas, sending them lurching forward with such force that Agatha felt her stomach drop and she was sent further back into her seat. An instant later, the brakes were slammed, jerking them all forward violently. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oops, meant to put it in reverse,” Sage shouted with zero remorse, yanking the gear shift forward. The car shot backward, tires squealing, before she slammed on the brakes again, sending all three of them hurtling forward like rag dolls.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They might as well have all had whiplash at this point.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio, however, was laughing uncontrollably, like a kid on a roller coaster.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage shifted back into drive and floored it, the car flying down the parking lot. When she made a sharp right turn onto the street, the car clipped the curb, jostling them violently as the air freshener hanging from the rearview mirror swung wildly, banging against the windshield.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“STOP THE FUCKING CAR NOW!” Agatha screamed over the blaring music. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage slammed on the brakes with such force that they all lurched forward again, groaning as their seat belts caught them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage and Rio turned to each other, wide eyed, like two kids about to get chewed out by a very pissed off parent.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And they were.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage quickly turned down the music, the silence almost deafening compared to the noise before, as they both slowly turned to face Agatha. Wide green and brown eyes stared at her like they were bracing for impact.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha took a deep breath, her nostrils flaring as she tried to find the words. “Pull the fucking car over. Rio, you drive.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They both just blinked at her in stunned silence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“NOW!” she yelled, her voice booming enough to make both of them jump.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage slammed on the gas and veered toward the curb, parking the car with a brutal jolt, half on the sidewalk and half in the street. The car tilted awkwardly, making the uneven parking job all the more obvious.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The moment Sage shifted into park, Agatha flew out of the car, storming around to the passenger side. She ripped the door open, her glare leaving no room for argument.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio climbed out of the car with her usual grace, walking calmly around to the driver’s side, her amusement barely contained. Meanwhile, Sage had already climbed into the back seat, looking far too pleased with herself given the situation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha slammed the passenger door shut, muttering under her breath as she climbed back into the car, pointedly ignoring the grin Sage was failing to hide in the rearview mirror.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio adjusted the driver’s seat, her movements deliberate as she settled in. Agatha crossed her arms tightly and sat stiffly in the passenger seat, glaring out the window like it might save her from losing her temper again. In the back, Sage leaned back casually, her arms draped across the seats, with a shit eating grin. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The silence stretched for an entire minute before Sage broke it. “So… does this mean I’m grounded?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha whipped her head around, her eyes wide. “</span><span class="s2">Grounded?</span> <span class="s1"> You should be </span> <span class="s2">buried.</span><span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s laugh was immediate and unhelpful, her fingers drumming against the steering wheel. “That’s a little extreme, don’t you think?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Extreme?” Agatha shot back, her voice rising. “She nearly killed us </span> <span class="s2">four times</span> <span class="s1"> before we even left the parking lot!” She turned back to Sage, her tone sharp. “And you think this is funny?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage shrugged, her lips twitching upward. “I mean, technically, I’m the only one in this car who can die so…… Relax. Next time I’ll aim for only </span> <span class="s2">two</span> <span class="s1"> near death experiences.” </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha snapped her head to Rio ignoring Sage. “And </span> <span class="s2">you!</span> <span class="s1"> Why the hell were you laughing?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a moment, Rio didn’t respond. Both hands gripped the wheel tightly, her lips pressed together as she fought desperately to keep herself from laughing. Her shoulders shook slightly, betraying her struggle to stay composed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You have the floor!” Agatha shouted, throwing her hands up in exasperation, trying to force Rio to say something.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shrugged, glancing at her out of the corner of her eye, completely unfazed. “I trust Sage. Besides, it was kind of fun. Like a really cheap theme park ride.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“A ride our daughter could have </span> <span class="s2">died</span> <span class="s1"> on,” Agatha retorted, slumping back into her seat, muttering something about idiotic green witches and their reckless behavior.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s head whipped around to stare at Agatha, her eyes wide with shock, while Sage shot forward in her seat, looking at her like she couldn’t possibly have heard her right.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha looked between them, baffled. “What?” she snapped, her voice boomed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then it hit her. Her own words replayed in her mind, and her expression froze as realization dawned.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Oh.</span></em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her shoulders sagged slightly as she turned to face Sage, already knowing what she would see. Sure enough, Sage’s face was lit up with the widest shit eating grin Agatha had seen from the girl yet, her green eyes lit up like a Christmas tree. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s jaw tightened, and she held up a single finger, speaking very, <em>very</em> slowly. “If you say one fucking word, I will personally shove my foot so far up your ass that it will come out of your mouth. Do I make myself clear?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage nodded eagerly, her grin so wide it looked like it might stretch clear to her ears. It was obvious she wasn’t taking Agatha’s threat seriously… Not even a little.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha reached over and plucked the orange hat off Rio’s head, pulling it down over her own eyes as she sank further into her chair. Maybe, just maybe, she could disappear for a while and finally get some fucking sleep.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her plan to rest was interrupted when she felt Rio’s hand settle gently on her thigh, giving it a light squeeze. The gesture was casual, but it sent a quiet warmth through her that she couldn’t ignore. They drove the rest of the way in comfortable silence, the music playing softly as Rio drummed her fingers on Agatha’s thigh, tapping in rhythm to the melody.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Eventually, Agatha sat straighter, lifting the hat from her head and setting it back on Rio’s, but backward this time. She smirked as Rio tilted her head slightly, clearly unbothered. Turning in her seat, Agatha glanced into the backseat to check on Sage, who was now passed out, lightly snoring with her mouth wide open.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Honestly, it was slightly unsettling. The sight made Agatha grimace. “Can’t say she’s a very peaceful looking sleeper,” she muttered, turning back around before the image stuck in her mind.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s laugh bellowed, deep and warm, before she quieted herself, careful not to wake Sage. “Can’t say I disagree,” she said softly, her tone full of amusement.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smiled, letting the sound of Rio’s laugh linger in her head for a moment. She didn’t filter her expression this time; there was no one awake to see it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They pulled into the line for the ferry that would take their car across to the island where their beach house waited. The soft hum of the engine and the gentle lapping of waves nearby filled the air.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Should we wake her up?” Agatha asked, glancing toward Sage again. She’d been the one so desperate to see the ocean, after all.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Not yet,” Rio said, her voice low. “I want her to see it all… Open and untouched. Not polluted with boats and people screaming because they spotted a dolphin. She’ll want it to be more important than that.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha turned back to look at Rio, studying her for a moment, then nodded silently. She agreed. Sage deserved to see the ocean the way she’d imagined it: quiet, vast, and full of wonder.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They pulled into the driveway of a baby blue beach house perched on stilts. It was stunning and it sat right at the edge of the sand. The houses were spaced far apart, offering a quiet kind of privacy that felt like a luxury. Agatha started to slip off her shoes, savoring the idea of finally relaxing, while Rio stepped out of the car and made her way to Sage’s door.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As soon as Rio opened it, Sage flailed, half asleep and disoriented, the seatbelt being the only thing keeping her from tumbling out. She managed to right herself with a groggy grunt, her head drooping before Rio’s voice cut through her haze.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Go look at the ocean, Petal,” Rio said softly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage snapped her head up, her wide green eyes locking onto Rio like she’d just been told something too good to be true. For a moment, she looked almost scared, as if the ocean might disappear if she didn’t get to it fast enough. She scrambled to unbuckle herself, her movements frantic, already kicking off her shoes and yanking her socks free. By the time she cuffed her jeans well above her ankles, she was practically trembling with urgency, her feet slapping against the ground as she bolted toward the sand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha followed quickly, her curiosity getting the better of her as she watched Sage sprint across the sand. Sage’s feet kicked up small sprays of it with every step, the grains glinting in the sunlight as they scattered behind her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage ran toward the water, her arms flailing slightly with the kind of chaotic energy that only came from pure emotion. She stopped abruptly at the edge of the shore, right where the waves rolled gently back onto the sand. When the water touched her feet for the first time, she froze.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As Agatha got closer, she noticed the change immediately. Sage’s entire body seemed to relax, her shoulders dropping, her tension melting away as the cool water kissed her skin. The moment was almost too perfect to interrupt. Overhead, heavy clouds began to part, the sun breaking through and casting a golden beam over the scene, making the ocean sparkle impossibly brighter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s breath caught as she watched. She wished she could see Sage’s face, but somehow, she already knew the expression it held. Awe. Peace. Something too pure to be ruined by words.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swore to god, in the far off distance, a whale breached the water, its massive body breaking through the waves as if it somehow sensed that someone was experiencing the ocean for the first time. The timing felt almost too perfect, like the universe itself had orchestrated the moment.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“So, how does it feel?” Agatha called out to Sage, her voice softer than usual, carried by the breeze.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Powerful,” Sage replied in wonderment, her voice quiet yet brimming with awe. Her hands hung loosely at her sides, and Agatha noticed faint gray magic sparking at her fingertips, subtle but alive. Sage didn’t even turn back to look at her; her focus was entirely on the sea.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t respond. She didn’t need to. She stood there silently, happy to watch as Sage soaked in the moment.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then Sage spoke again, “For all at last return to the sea- to Oceanus, the ocean river, like the ever-flowing stream of time, the beginning and the end.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze. The Rachel Carson quote struck a chord deep within her. She wanted to respond, to argue about its meaning, to challenge the words that Sage had so calmly recited, but she didn’t. She knew Sage would force her into a debate about it later. Right now, Sage deserved this moment, uninterrupted. And truthfully, it was poetic as hell.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage turned, throwing a soft smile back at her before facing the water again. Agatha felt her heart melt into a puddle right then and there, the tenderness of the gesture striking her in ways she didn’t expect.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without another word, Agatha turned and began walking toward the beach house. As she approached, she looked up and saw Rio standing on the balcony, their duffels in hand. Her face was lit up with the most genuine smile Agatha had ever seen from her, gap tooth and all, radiating a warmth that rivaled the sun.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt a pull in her chest, a quiet kind of longing she rarely let herself feel so openly. She picked up her pace, not sure what she’d say to Rio when she got there, but knowing it didn’t matter. Whatever words came out would pale in comparison to the look Rio was already giving her.</span>

<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“How long do you think she’ll stand there?” Agatha asked, her voice quiet but laced with curiosity.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They stood side by side at the railing of the balcony, both silently watching Sage as she stood facing the ocean. Their duffles rested by the back door, forgotten for the moment. They had arrived early enough in the morning that the day still stretched endlessly before them. Sage had all the time in the world to lose herself in the vastness, and Rio and Agatha had all the time to watch her do it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No clue,” Rio murmured, her gaze fixed on Sage. “She could stand there forever.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha understood. She knew Rio did too. After all, they were doing the same thing Sage was- marveling at the view. The only difference was what they saw.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For them, the ocean wasn’t the focal point. It was Sage. The life they had created, standing there as if she wasn’t just a part of the universe but the very center of it. The waves and horizon were her backdrop, and nothing could compare to the quiet, infinite wonder of her existence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Of course, Sage chose this very moment to shatter the calm. She spun around, trudging up the shore with purpose, and shouted, “Hey, Harkness! Up for a debate?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“So I can school you on your lame sea poetry? Sure!” Agatha shot back, but she wasn’t ready, </span> <span class="s2">not even close.</span> <span class="s1"> Every literature debate with Sage hit her like a storm at sea. It was an overwhelming force that knocked her flat and left her gasping for air. But as harsh as the impact was, it always pulled something loose, washing away the old debris of her defenses and leaving her with something raw but cleaner.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The process was brutal, but in its aftermath, it felt healing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I’m gonna go ahead and get our stuff inside and finish unpacking the car. Good luck!” Rio called over her shoulder, already heading toward the back door.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I’ll fucking need it,” Agatha muttered under her breath, steeling herself as she started down the balcony stairs. Her steps carried her toward the two lounging chairs set up halfway between the beach house and the water, off to the right. The chairs were perfectly placed, nestled in the sand but close enough to catch the sea breeze. Agatha’s focus, however, was already shifting toward the storm heading her way in the form of Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Agatha even had the chance to settle into the seat to Sage’s right, Sage spoke, “ ‘For all at last return to the sea- to Oceanus, the ocean river, like the ever-flowing stream of time, the beginning and the end.’ That one hits close to home, huh?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha narrowed her eyes, sliding into the chair. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She mumbled, her gaze flickering to the side in search for something, anything, that wasn’t piercing green eyes. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She absolutely knew what Sage was talking about. She was talking about something Rio had spent centuries chasing her to explain, something Rio had begged her to understand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage rolls her eyes at that, “Okay,” she drawls out. “Well, do you still believe all the ocean does is take?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No,” Agatha admitted, her hands gripped the arms of her chair and swallows hard forcing out the rest, “But I believe that’s what it’s best at. Whatever it gives doesn’t make up for what it takes. It’s impossible to separate, and I’m curious how you plan to twist that into some moralizing lecture about balance.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s expression shifted, the faintest hint of disappointment crossing her face. Agatha had expected it, she always had. For every step forward Agatha managed to take, she fought just as hard to stumble ten steps back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha was trying. She was being honest, more than she had been in years, but the truth was a weight she couldn’t fully carry. It felt impossible to untangle Rio from their son’s death. The two were bound together in her mind, the pain too deeply etched to separate one from the other. How could she look at Rio and ignore the loss that had shattered them both?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s brows furrow, “Not balance. Inevitability. The ocean is where it all starts- life crawling out of the primordial soup, right? But the sea reclaims everything in time. All roads lead back to her eventually, don’t they?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha turned her gaze toward Sage, her jaw tightening in irritation. She could feel it coming- the kind of conversation where every word pressed every raw nerve. Through gritted teeth, she said, “I’ve lived long enough to know, Sage. It takes, it drowns, it buries. That’s its nature. What’s left is what survives.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“And yet,” Sage countered, her voice soft and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>her green eyes pleading for Agatha to understand, “you wouldn’t be here if it hadn’t given you something. And you wouldn’t stay if you didn’t believe that on some level.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Maybe,” Agatha admitted after a long pause. Her grip on the chair slackened, and she brought her hands to her lap, her gaze fixed on them as though avoiding Sage’s eyes might soften the blow of Agatha’s own question. Her voice, when it came, was quieter, almost trembling. “But what do you do when the ocean takes something you can never get back?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t falter in her response, “You let it carry you forward. You let it turn grief into something new.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s shoulders sank at the words, her throat tightening as if they’d struck a place she wasn’t ready to face. She didn’t look up. How could she? Sage’s answer wasn’t wrong, but it was too simple for something so devastating. Agatha had no sharp retort, just the ache that settled deeper into her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage continues at Agatha’s lack of a response, “You know, you don’t hate the ocean as much as you say you do. You hate what it’s taken from you.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s words drew Agatha’s gaze back up, her mouth opening to respond, but no words came. Her jaw tightened, and she pressed her lips into a thin line instead. She hesitated, studying Sage for a moment. When Agatha spoke, her voice was almost bitter. “You think I haven’t thought about that? It feels like a betrayal to accept it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I think you’ve thought about it so much it’s driven you mad. And I think you’re terrified to admit that Rio might be your Oceanus.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They might have danced around the topic, but none of this was new to Agatha. Rio had said it before, countless times, in countless ways. But hearing the words now, coming from Sage, stripped of anger, grief, and the magnitude of centuries, they felt different. They felt <em>inevitable</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was as though the truth had been waiting all this time, lingering just out of reach until Agatha was ready to face it. And maybe that was the most infuriating part of all, how much of it she already knew. She had spent lifetimes running from this truth, burying it under pain and bitterness, only for it to resurface now, spoken so simply by a girl who had every reason to give up on her but had not.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swallowed hard, her gaze flickering back to Sage. She hated how much her daughter reminded her of herself- the sharpness, the confidence, the way she could cut through layers of bullshit with a single sentence. But what made Sage different, what made her <em>good</em>, was that she could still see the possibility of healing in things Agatha had long written off as a lost cause. Maybe that was the only reason Agatha hadn’t walked away from this conversation yet. Because Sage’s relentless hope was a lifeline, whether she wanted it to be or not. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt her carefully constructed walls were crumbling all over again, leaving her exposed to something she had spent centuries resisting: forgiveness. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">After their conversation, Agatha didn’t bother sticking around long enough to figure out where anyone had gone. She didn’t care. The only thing she knew was that the house was empty, and she was utterly fucking beat. It wasn’t even noon and she already needed a breather. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The house was beautiful, bathed in the bright light of midday. Sunlight poured through the oversized windows, filling the open spaces with a natural warmth. The decor leaned into a coastal theme, with navy blues, creamy whites, and weathered wood accents. It was tasteful, serene, and entirely not Agatha’s style. She hated it, truly, but she could already imagine Sage marveling over every little detail. Against her better judgment, she felt her opinion shift, just slightly, though she would never admit it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2"><em>Maybe</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The house was spacious, a two story structure with an understated elegance. Agatha wandered up the staircase, her fingers brushing along the smooth wooden banister as she took in the quiet charm of the place. The second floor felt just as serene as the first. She stopped at the first door on the left, a spare bedroom. Rio’s duffle bag rested neatly on the bed,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>unpacked. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She wandered further down the hall, her steps slowing as she reached what she assumed to be the master bedroom. When she pushed the door open, her duffel bag sat neatly on the bed, as if it had been waiting for her. Agatha felt a pang of disappointment twist in her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><em> <span class="s2">It makes sense</span> </em> <span class="s1">, Agatha told herself. Things between them were still…. complicated. They hadn’t talked about sleeping arrangements, and maybe that silence had been intentional. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They had been sleeping in separate rooms for a while, except the night before Nicky’s anniversary. The weight of their conversation and what the next day would bring had been too much to carry alone. By the following night, they had returned to their respective rooms.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">During her nights spent alone in Rio’s realm, Agatha had welcomed the space, convinced herself it was necessary. She needed to prove it to herself, if no one else, that she could confront the chaos within her without relying on the comfort of brown or green eyes watching over her. She needed to prove that even when the darkness surged, when her chaos threatened to consume her, she could endure it. She could fight it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t easy. Some nights, the storm inside begged her to run, to give in to the urge to shatter and scatter. But every morning, she made the same choice. She stayed. She stayed because staying was an act of defiance against everyone and everything that told her she couldn’t. Every sunrise was proof that even in her loneliest moments, she could still find the strength to wake up, to endure, to rebuild.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage might have dragged her through the door kicking and screaming the whole way, but Agatha was the one who had done the heavy lifting. Every step forward, every wound reopened, every truth faced, it had been her struggle and her effort, no matter how much Sage had pushed. The work had been Agatha’s and Agatha’s alone.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha was no longer pieces of a broken puzzle, scattered too far apart to even attempt to fit together again. She had fought to rebuild herself, piece by piece, reclaiming the strength she thought she had lost. Yet, as she stood there staring at her duffel bag, the emptiness of the room pressed against her. This wasn’t who she was anymore. She hadn’t clawed her way back from the edge just to settle for distance, for empty spaces that didn’t feel like home. She had done the work. And standing here, apart from Rio, felt like denying everything she had fought so hard to become. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She couldn’t tell if Rio’s decision was made out of respect or for her own peace of mind. Either way, pressing the issue felt wrong. Whatever the reason, it was clear Rio wasn’t ready for more, and Agatha wasn’t about to push her. With a heavy exhale, she let the thought go and headed into the bedroom to change into her swimsuit.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The navy bikini she chose was simple, understated, but it suited her in a way that felt effortless. It hugged her figure in a way that was both natural and striking, drawing attention without asking for it. There was nothing extravagant about it, yet it fit her as though it had been made for her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">After throwing on a pair of sunglasses on top of her head, she made her way down the stairs, her bare feet tapping softly against the wooden floor. The house was still quiet, the only sound came from the faint crash of waves beyond the glass sliding door at the back. She slid it open, the warm ocean air greeting her immediately. She descended another set of stairs to the beach. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her feet met the sand and she let the softness of it shift beneath her feet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As she walked further along, her gaze landed on Rio, stretched out effortlessly in one of the lounge chairs where she and Sage had sat earlier. The setup had changed slightly; a small cooler rested in the sand next to Rio, and an umbrella was planted nearby, casting a patch of shade. Agatha’s steps slowed as her attention lingered on Rio, basking in all her damn glory. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was striking, as always, wearing a simple black string bikini that didn’t leave much to the imagination. Her brown hair was down, falling in soft waves just at her shoulders, and a baby blue baseball cap sat snugly on her head. A pair of dark metal frame sunglasses concealed her eyes, adding an air of effortless confidence to her already commanding presence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">In her lap rested her sketchbook, and Agatha could just make out the beginnings of sand, water, and sky unfolding in light pencil strokes. Rio was capturing the endless scene stretching out in front of her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a moment, Agatha just stood there, caught between awe and hesitation, the soft breeze tugging at her hair and carrying the faint scent of saltwater. Rio didn’t glance up, entirely absorbed in her work. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not long ago, she had told the woman, </span> <span class="s2"><em>‘I don’t want to see your face</em>.</span> <span class="s1">’ </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Out of all the lies Agatha Harkness had told in her long, <em>long</em> lifetime, this one made its way into the top five biggest- not because it was clever or necessary, but because it was an utterly pathetic attempt to deny the truth. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The truth was that she wanted to see every part of Rio, in every form, every fragment of Death and Life that made her who she was.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re staring,” Rio’s smooth voice pulled her from her thoughts.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I am,” Agatha said, her voice steady, no longer bothering to deny it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s pencil stilled, hovering just above the page. Her head tilted slightly, though she didn’t look up. Agatha noticed the faintest shift in her posture. It was barely noticeable like Rio was trying to decide whether to acknowledge the moment or brush it aside.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smirked to herself. She’d disrupted Rio’s focus, broken through her carefully crafted calm. It was subtle, but it was there, and the victory was sweeter than she’d expected. Maybe Rio wasn’t as untouchable as she wanted to seem.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha spared Rio from the decision as she plopped herself down in the lounge chair beside her. “Where’s our kid?” she asked casually, leaning back and sliding her sunglasses down to cover her eyes, as though she hadn’t just casually dropped a bomb.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Another blow to Rio’s composure. The question wasn’t an accidental slip; it was deliberate, and it hit its mark with precision. The effect was immediate. Rio’s head whipped toward her so fast it was a wonder it didn’t snap.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t elaborate, didn’t rush to fill the silence. She simply looked at Rio with the faintest teasing smile- a smile that said she knew exactly what she’d said and exactly what she was doing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio let out a huff of air and shook her head, a small smile tugging at her lips despite the furrowed brow that hinted at a mix of disbelief and amusement. “She, um,” she started, gesturing weakly with a thumb over her shoulder before the words died on her lips. Another huff escaped as she shook her head again, the smile she was fighting clearly becoming harder to resist. “She met a group of college kids. Something about wanting to argue Aristotle with some guy who thinks he knows more than he does. Said not to wait up for her.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha pulled her sunglasses up and perched them on top of her head, her gaze snapping to Rio in disbelief. “And you just let her go?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shrugged, setting her sketchbook down in the sand beside her. She leaned back, her posture infuriatingly relaxed. “Yeah, why not?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s eyes widened. “Why not? What if it’s a cult she’s being tricked into joining? What then?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s lips curved into a faint smirk as she tilted her head toward Agatha. “Honestly, she’d probably choose joining a cult over spending the night arguing Aristotle.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha blinked, the absurdity of the statement somehow landing as truth. <em>Sage </em></span> <em> <span class="s2">would</span> </em> <span class="s1"><em> do that. But stil</em>l. “That’s not the point, Rio. What if someone starts asking questions? Who she’s with, where she’s from?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio sighed, pulling her own sunglasses up to rest on her hat before turning her full attention to Agatha. “Agatha, she can talk circles around anyone about absolutely nothing for hours. She’s careful,” Rio said, her tone edged with a mother’s unshakable certainty.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha wasn’t convinced. She turned fully toward Rio, gripping the arm of her chair, her intensity palpable. “It takes one person, Rio. One person looking too closely. You know that as well as I do.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio met her gaze, her own expression remained calm, though her voice softened slightly. “I do. But she’s not helpless. You’ve seen what she’s capable of. She can handle herself.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“She’s not invincible, Rio,” Agatha countered, her voice tight.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“We can’t lock her away because we’re scared. She’d never forgive us, and honestly, we’d never forgive ourselves.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The conviction in Rio’s voice hit Agatha like a wave. For a moment, she said nothing, her lips pressed into a thin line, the tension in her hands visible where they gripped the chair. She hated how reasonable Rio sounded, how right she </span> <span class="s2">felt</span> <span class="s1"> in the way she spoke about their daughter. But it didn’t ease the knot in her chest.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha barked out an aggressive, “Whatever!” and threw herself back into the lounging chair, crossing her arms over her chest like a petulant child.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio laughed, the sound warm, as she turned onto her side to reach for Agatha’s wrist. “Relax,” she drawled, her fingers gently trying to pry at Agatha’s stubbornly folded arms.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swatted at her hands with an exaggerated huff. “Don’t touch me,” she grumbled, her tone more dramatic than angry.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio rolled her eyes and let out a frustrated groan. “Fine, if you’re going to be like this-” She shuffled to her feet, the movement graceful despite her mock irritation. Standing tall, she loomed over Agatha, the sun glinting off her tanned skin, and reached again for her wrists. “Come on! Get up!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha relented, though she would deny it later. She told herself her sudden compliance had nothing to do with the way Rio looked in that damn bathing suit, the fabric clinging to her skin in all the right ways or more so, the lack of fabric. But no, it wasn’t that. <em>It was just easier to go along with it than to keep arguing.</em> At least, that’s what she told herself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She let Rio pull her up and out of the chair with both hands. Rio walked backward a few steps, letting go of one of Agatha’s hands to turn and pull her toward the shore. Once Agatha realized what was happening, she started digging her heels into the sand. “Nope, not doing that,” she said firmly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio stumbled slightly from Agatha’s resistance, her momentum tugged back. She stopped and turned to face Agatha, a teasing glint already dancing in her eyes. “Aww, are you scared?” she asked, her voice dripping with mock sympathy as she reached up to brush Agatha’s cheek like she was soothing her. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha slapped at her hand, her glare sharp and unimpressed. “The problem,” she said slowly, her lips pressed into a thin line, “is that I’m not about to waddle into a giant soup of fish, crabs, or whatever else is lurking in there.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio blinked, stunned for a moment, “You’re scared of fish?” she repeated.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Not scared!” Agatha snapped, her cheeks flushing slightly. “I just don’t trust them. They’re unpredictable.” She rolled her eyes, clearly irritated by her own honesty.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio gave her a playful tug toward the water, unfazed by Agatha’s resistance. “Agatha, trust the sea.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Well, about that,” Agatha said with a forced chuckle, “I had a fun little chat with Sage earlier, and my business with the sea? It’s settled. Why test it?” Her voice was light, but her body language betrayed her unease. She peeked around Rio, her eyes narrowing at the waves rolling onto the shore, stronger than she would’ve liked. “I’d also particularly like to avoid being tossed around by those waves, thank you very much.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Agatha,” Rio said firmly, her tone cutting through the excuses.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze remained locked on the ocean. “Hm?” she replied distractedly, still avoiding Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She felt the tug on her wrist, gentle but firm, and finally turned her head, her eyes meeting warm brown. The pull of Rio’s steady gaze was impossible to ignore.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Trust me,” Rio said, her voice quiet but resolute.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitated, glancing back at the ocean, then back at Rio. She let out an aggressive hum of frustration, tossing one last glare at the water before narrowing her eyes at Rio. “Fine. Let’s go for a fucking swim, then.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She stomped past Rio, her hand still firmly gripping Agatha’s. She tugged the green witch along in an ungraceful march, determined but clearly still unhappy. Agatha didn’t look back at Rio, but she could feel that knowing smirk plastered on her face. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stopped abruptly at the shoreline, the water just shy of her toes. She turned her head to Rio, eyebrows raised, and gave her a pointed look before jutting her chin toward the water, silently demanding Rio go first.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">To Agatha’s mild surprise, Rio didn’t put up a fight. Without hesitation, she stepped forward, the waves greeting her ankles as she waded into the water, unbothered and elegant. Agatha stayed put, arms crossed, watching her carefully.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio took a step further out, the waves immediately stilled, the water becoming uncharacteristically calm. The gentle roll of the tide disappeared, leaving the surface glassy and clear. Even the sand beneath the water settled. Agatha blinked in surprise as she looked around. There wasn’t a single person or fish in sight for miles.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The tension in her shoulders eased. Of course, Rio could do this. She was the original green witch, a master of earth magic. Her power wasn’t limited to plants-it encompassed all the elements. Rio just happened to prefer playing in the dirt and pretending she enjoyed the taste of rocks over anything else. (Not that Rio had actually eaten rocks… <em>allegedly</em>.)</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio turned and walked back up to the edge of the shore, her expression calm and assured as she extended a hand toward Agatha. “Ready?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha took it, stepping forward. The water was warm, the sun bright starting to hang lower in the sky. She followed Rio willingly, the water lapping gently at her calves as they moved a little deeper. When Rio let go of her hand, Agatha paused, watching her move a few feet ahead.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio turned back, arms crossing as she studied Agatha. Her gaze dragged up and down Agatha’s body deliberately, and her tongue pressed into her cheek. It was not smugness, not entirely. This was Rio fighting the urge to unleash that big gap toothed smile, the one that always threatened to break her calm façade.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You wanna make out?” Rio asked, her tone casual but her eyes full of mischief.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No shit,” Agatha replied without hesitation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio uncrossed her arms and planted them firmly on her hips. She gave a swift nod, her gaze sweeping down the expanse of Agatha’s body one more time, her tongue still pressed into her cheek. This time, her expression looked more serious, more intent. When her eyes finally met Agatha’s, her voice was steady. “Okay. I’ll be over there if you want me.” She gestured further out into the water with a slight tilt of her head.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And with that, Rio turned and walked toward the deeper water.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Careful what you wish for!” Agatha called after her, her voice tinged with playful defiance.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio stopped waist deep in the water and turned back, her smirk unmistakable even from a distance. “I never wish for anything I don’t already want!” she shouted. Then, without hesitation, she fell backward into the water, her movements as ungraceful as they were deliberate.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">A few seconds later, she reemerged, holding her hat firmly to her head as water dripped down her face and shoulders. The water now reached just below her shoulders. Rio took off her hat and tossed it toward Agatha. “Throw it to the shore!” she yelled.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha caught the hat, her lips twitching into a reluctant smile as she turned to toss it onto the sand. She exhaled slowly, her defenses crumbling. “Rio Vidal, you could charm the damn stars out of the sky if you wanted to,” she muttered under her breath before stepping into the water. She moved toward Rio, the pull of her fears suddenly no match against the pull of the ocean. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Chasing Death, yet again. And Agatha knew she would do it again, and again, and again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Determined to reach Rio faster, Agatha dove beneath the surface, her body cutting through the water. When she resurfaced, she was close enough to stand, the water coming just below her shoulders. She wiped her face with open palms, clearing her vision. As her hands fell, she saw Rio standing in front of her, closer than she expected.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes were slightly wide, her expression unreadable, as though she couldn’t believe Agatha had actually followed her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t hesitate. She reached for Rio’s waist, her fingers curling into her skin to pull her closer. One hand moved to the base of Rio’s neck, keeping her near. Their faces were inches apart, but Agatha didn’t close the distance yet. Instead, she let her eyes trace Rio’s face, lingering on every feature. Her hand slid from Rio’s waist, moving to her face, where her thumb traced a smooth, deliberate path across her cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha noticed Rio’s gaze lingering on her lips, her eyes half lidded and dark with intent. Dipping her chin, Agatha tilted her head slightly, trying to draw Rio’s attention back up. Her fingers slid into the hair at the nape of Rio’s neck, giving the softest tug, a silent coaxing for Rio to meet her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes fluttered closed and her hands found immediate purchase on Agatha’s wrists like she was trying to find the strength to brace for impact. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For as long as they had known each other, whenever Agatha held Rio like this, cradling her head and face with such tenderness, Rio’s hands would instinctively grasp Agatha’s wrists. It was as if the Keeper of the Sacred Balance herself needed something solid to steady her, a quiet vulnerability to anchor the weight of her own endlessness.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But when Rio finally blinked her eyes open, Agatha saw her completely. Something shifted. Agatha felt herself drowning in their depth, captivated by the quiet strength and vulnerability they held. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">In that moment, Agatha understood what it felt like to be pulled into the ocean’s embrace, to lose herself in its beauty, its endlessness. It was overwhelming and grounding all at once. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio exhaled a shaky breath, as though offering Agatha all the air in her lungs to breathe. Water dripped down her face, and her lips parted briefly as she licked them, steadying herself for what she was about to say. “You see?” Her lips twitched, wanting to pull into one of her lazy, signature smirks, but it lacked the energy.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha had no clue what Rio was going to say. She guessed it was probably a joke, something to lighten the tension, not for herself but for Agatha. She would say something like, </span> <span class="s2">‘You see? I’m not so scary after all,’</span> <span class="s1"> and let humor deflect the weight that presses heavy on Agatha’s chest, when things tended to feel too big.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But before Rio could speak, Agatha beat her to it. Her voice was soft, repeating the quote Sage had said the day before, from </span> <em> <span class="s2">The Book Thief</span> </em> <span class="s1">:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“Even Death has a heart.” She swiped her thumb gently across Rio’s cheek. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio whimpered. The sound was soft, unguarded, and her eyes fluttered shut at the touch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And that. Was the final blow that even Death herself couldn’t recover from. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And Agatha, for all her strength and centuries of poise, was grateful they were standing in water. If they’d been on solid ground, she would have collapsed at the sound of it, undone by the vulnerability in Rio’s voice.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“She does,” Rio whispered, her voice trembling. “And it beats for you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha pulled Rio in. She wouldn’t wait anymore. Rio surrendered before their mouths even connected, her body softening as she gave herself over completely. There was no resistance, no hesitation. By the time their lips met, Rio’s mouth opened instinctively, offering herself freely without Agatha needing to ask.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t hesitate to take what Rio offered. Her lips moved deliberately, her tongue tracing the curve of Rio’s bottom lip before venturing further, exploring every inch of Rio’s mouth as though she wanted to memorize it. Each movement was slow, savoring the way Rio moans melted into her mouth. The warmth of Rio’s breath mingled with her own, and the faint taste of salt lingered. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha pulled away from the kiss, but this time Rio chased her mouth, leaning forward with unspoken need. Agatha’s breath hitched, when Rio’s lips parted slightly, asking for more and Agatha whimpered at the sight.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio pulled back just enough to meet Agatha’s eyes, her gaze steady. “Take me inside, Agatha,” she whispered, her voice soft and trembling. It wasn’t a demand. It was a plea. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could only nod, her breathless, “Yeah,” barely audible. She took Rio’s hand and began leading her out of the ocean. The moment Rio’s feet left the water, the waves behind them surged with renewed strength, crashing against the shore as if the ocean itself mourned her absence.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha led Rio toward the house, their hands still intertwined as they stepped away from the water’s edge. The ocean breeze clung to their skin. She stopped briefly, leaning down to pick up Rio’s hat from where it had landed earlier. She never let go of Rio’s hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With Agatha leading, Rio followed willingly, their steps synchronized as they made their way up the beach. Agatha paused again at the chairs they had been using earlier. She tucked Rio’s hat under her arm and bent to grab her sketchbook before continuing toward the house. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At the top of the stairs, she dropped Rio’s hat onto the balcony railing, leaving it to dry in the sun. Once inside, she tossed the sketchbook onto the kitchen table. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As Agatha led Rio up the stairs inside, her thoughts turned to their duffel bags resting in separate rooms. It wasn’t about needing anything from them. What lingered in her mind was the space it represented, the distance she no longer wanted between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With an abrupt stop outside the spare bedroom, Agatha dropped Rio’s hand and spun around, causing Rio to stumble into her. Rio blinked, confused by the sudden halt, but before she could ask, Agatha’s hands settled on her waist to steady her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t let them part. She kept their bodies close, leaning in until her lips hovered just by Rio’s ear. Her voice dropped into a teasing whisper, as though about to confess some forbidden secret. “I’m mad at you, you know.” There was no trace of malice in her tone.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio turned her head slightly, trying to catch a glimpse of Agatha’s expression. Rio’s brows furrowed and her eyes narrowed with mock suspicion. The corner of her lips twitched into a curious smile. “Oh? Wanna kiss and make up?” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha almost said yes. In fact, she wanted nothing more than to kiss Rio. Especially when Rio’s lips parted slightly, as if she was ready to be completely consumed by Agatha. Agatha’s eyes locked on to those lips, her focus unwavering as that teasing smile grew wider.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Agatha wouldn’t give in so easily. She pulled her gaze back up to meet teasing brown, “You know I would, but-”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Coward,” Rio interrupted, her tone playful. She was provoking Agatha, pushing her buttons, desperate for her to cave.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha feigned a look of deep offense, her hand flying to her chest as if she had been mortally wounded. “Pardon?” she gasped, her voice dripping with mock indignation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You heard me,” Rio replied, her grin widening even more, the familiar gap in her teeth on full display.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha narrowed her eyes, her lips twitching into a smirk. “I think the real coward is the one who was too scared to put our bags in the same bedroom.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s smile softened into something sly. “Maybe I just wanted to hear you say it,” she countered, her voice teasing and daring Agatha to make the next move.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“And what exactly would that be?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“That you want me,” Rio said, but the words carried a weight that made the air between them shift. They weren’t just playful; they were a declaration, a truth etched into every glance, every touch, and every sacrifice Rio had made. For nearly three centuries, Rio had chased Agatha through lifetimes of grief and stubbornness, proving time and time again how much she wanted her, how much she always would.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stilled, the playful smirk fading from her lips as the gravity of Rio’s words settled over her. She didn’t look away though, Agatha couldn’t even if she tried. The truth between them hung heavy, daring Agatha to confront the gravity of what Rio had always been willing to give.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I don’t want anything else,” Agatha said, the words escaping her before she could second guess them. Her eyes searched Rio’s, her own vulnerability shining through. “I never have.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s teasing smile faded into something softer, almost sad. “You’ve got a real funny way of showing it,” Rio whispered. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Yeah, well, we hit a few bumps in the road,” Agatha said with a shrug, her eyes holding Rio’s. “But it led me back to you eventually, didn’t it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s smile grew, soft and knowing, as she leaned just slightly closer. “Funny thing about fate.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha rolled her eyes and ignored the comment, “We need showers. Use my bathroom. I’ll shower in the spare. Don’t forget to grab your shit on the way there.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“The thought of doing the nasty in the shower not doing it for you?” Rio teased, raising a suggestive eyebrow while her tongue pushed into her cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Rio, get your stuff. I’ll be in there when you’re done.” Agatha went for the doorknob of the spare bedroom, but Rio stopped her. She reached for the doorknob instead, turning it open before grabbing her bag off the bed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio walked down the hall, then turned back to face Agatha. With a swing of her arm, Rio tossed her bag into the bigger bedroom.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> “See you in a few?” A plea.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Count on it.” A promise.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">—</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha lingered in the spare bathroom, the towel wrapped snugly around her damp body. She had heard the soft shake of the pipes as Rio turned off the shower, a sound that made her pulse quicken. Agatha’s hair was still mostly damp, and though her skin had dried, she felt no urge to change. Instead, she took a deep, steadying breath, gathering herself, and made her way out of the bathroom and down the hall. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><br/>Agatha didn’t hesitate to open the door. She stepped inside and closed it quietly behind her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her blue eyes immediately found the double doors to the bathroom, left open as if they had been waiting for her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> Rio stood there between two sinks, completely naked. Her hair fell in loose waves like she had casually run her fingers through it. Rio wasn’t looking at her reflection in the mirror. Rio was looking at Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was as if she had known Agatha would enter at that exact moment. As if she had been waiting, her body on full, unapologetic display.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha’s breath caught, her knees threatening to give out beneath her. </span>Her gaze dropped, trailing along the curve of Rio’s shoulders, gliding over the smooth expanse of her back, and landing firmly on the perfect arch of her ass. Agatha inhaled sharply, the sound loud in the stillness of the room.</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">The towel around her body felt suffocating, unnecessary. It slipped from Agatha’s grasp and fell to the floor without a second thought.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, Agatha crossed the distance, until she stood just inches away from Rio. The warmth of Rio’s skin seemed to draw her in, and her dark brown eyes stayed fixed on her, drinking in every detail of Agatha openly leering. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio placed her hands on the counter and leaned forward slightly, her movements unhurried, a challenge burning in her gaze. She was waiting for Agatha to close the space between them, daring her to move first.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha closed the distance between them in one purposeful step, her body pressing fully against Rio’s. The sensation of bare skin meeting bare skin after centuries apart was electric, a rush of heat and memory colliding all at once. Her hands flew to Rio’s waist, her grip gentle. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha began tracing the curve of Rio’s hips with her fingertips, rediscovering what had been lost to time. Rio exhaled a soft gasp, the sound so delicate it sent a ripple of heat through Agatha. It wasn’t just a reaction; it was an invitation. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Suddenly, the fire in Rio’s gaze was gone. It was no longer a challenge but an offering, a silent surrender wrapped in trust and longing. Rio stood there, exposed in every sense, as if baring more than just her body.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">In that moment, Agatha realized that Rio’s surrender wasn’t weakness- it was a gift. It was trust stripped completely naked, a love that spanned centuries, unbroken even by betrayal and loss. Rio wasn’t just giving herself; she was laying her soul bare</span>
<span class="s2">. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Death, who had claimed so much, now willingly offered herself to Agatha as if to say, </span>
<em>
<span class="s2">Take what is yours. I belong to you.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tugged gently at Rio’s waist, urging her to turn around. Rio moved like she had been waiting for this moment, her body responding instinctively. Her hand found their way into Agatha’s damp hair, fingers tangling in the strands as she pulled their foreheads together. Agatha’s arms tightened around Rio, drawing their bodies completely flush once more, the feeling pulling unfiltered moans from both women. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s free hand rose to Agatha’s face, her thumb grazing over her bottom lip in a touch so tender it sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. Rio’s dark eyes fixed on Agatha’s lips, her gaze carried the weight of someone drowning, desperate for salvation. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Please,” Rio whispered, her voice trembling with a vulnerability that felt like an open wound, exposed but unafraid. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And who was Agatha to deny her? Death was inevitable, yes, but Rio was something more. She was life and loss, love and grief, everything Agatha had ever feared and desired mixed into one. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t stop herself. The moment their lips collided, it was like a dam breaking, all the tension and longing pouring out in a desperate, consuming kiss. The force of it sent Rio into the counter, the edge digging into the back of Rio’s hips as the vanity’s drawers jolted from the impact. The sound barely registered in Agatha’s mind, overwhelmed as she was by the heat of Rio’s body and the intoxicating press of their mouths.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Their lips parted instinctively, open and inviting, and Agatha’s tongue darted forward, claiming Rio’s with a hunger that felt insatiable. The slick, soft heat of Rio’s tongue met hers, tasting her with the same intensity. Agatha explored every inch of Rio’s mouth, savoring the taste of her as if she had been starved for centuries- which, in a way, she absolutely fucking had.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha wanted to drown in it, in Rio, in the taste and feel of her, and she had no intention of letting go.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s hands roamed over Rio’s body, her arms tightening around her waist as Rio’s arms looped over her shoulders, pulling her impossibly close. With a firm tug, Agatha urged Rio upward, and Rio instinctively shifted, helping to hoist herself onto the edge of the counter. A soft gasp slipped from Rio’s lips as the cold marble met the bare skin of her ass, Agatha felt the shiver it sent up the green witch’s spine.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha pulled her lips away from Rio’s, and a needy whimper escaped Rio as she chased after them, desperate to keep the space between them closed. Agatha shifted instead, brushing her mouth teasingly against the corner of Rio’s lips before moving to her jaw. She left a slow, open mouthed kiss there, followed by a gentle suck that painted a faint bruise directly on Rio’s jawline.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio let out a quiet moan, one hand flying to Agatha’s cheek and the other gripping her shoulder, trying to keep her in place, but Agatha was relentless.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her lips traveled to Rio’s neck, trailing languid, open mouthed kisses along the sensitive skin. Her tongue followed each kiss with deliberate slowness, savoring the taste of Rio as she moved lower. Agatha continued her path, her kisses growing more possessive until her mouth reached the space between Rio’s breasts. There, she sucked harder, leaving a dark bruise that felt like a declaration of her claim.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s breathing grew unsteady, her chest rising and falling with ragged gasps. Her hand slipped from Agatha’s shoulder to brace against the counter as she leaned back slightly, granting Agatha easier access and grounding herself against the intensity of Agatha’s touch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt Rio’s other hand slide to the back of her head, fingers tangling in her hair as she tugged gently, guiding her exactly where Rio wanted her most.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had always had a weakness for a specific kind of attention Agatha was more than happy to give. Whether it was her mouth or her fingers, nipple play was the one thing Rio would beg for, without a doubt. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Every. Single. Time. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Out of the two of them, Agatha had always been the louder one in bed, her pleasure spilling out in gasps and cries. Lady Death, on the other hand, was a quiet lover, her moans soft and restrained, her whimpers barely above a whisper. It drove Agatha wild, desperate for every sound Rio let slip.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha leaned in closer, her breath warm against Rio’s skin as she hovered over her already hardened nipple. Tilting her head upward, Agatha’s chin just barely brushed against it, the motion far from accidental, sending a shiver through Rio’s body. A sharp gasp escaped Rio’s lips, her chest jerking at the contact.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s brown eyes, dark and heavy with need, flickered down briefly to where Agatha lingered before returning to meet her gaze. The smallest tilt of Agatha’s chin teased her further, and a smirk curved on Agatha’s lips, open and inviting in a way that looked utterly maddening.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s voice trembled, yearning, as she whispered hoarsely, “Agatha…” Her breath hitched, the pause thick with tension.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I’m begging,” Rio’s voice was raw and desperate, the words lingered in the air like a prayer.</span> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha flicked her tongue over the sensitive peak, tracing slow, delicate circles, savoring the way Rio’s breath hitched. A trembling whimper escaped Rio, sending a rush of heat through Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She couldn’t tease Rio any longer. Her lips closed around the bud, sucking softly, and Rio’s quiet control shattered. A moan escaped her, loud and unrestrained, as though she had finally found her voice. Her body arched forward, pressing closer to Agatha, pleading for more.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smirked against Rio’s skin, her tongue and lips working to draw out every sound Rio had to offer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As Agatha lavished attention on each of Rio’s nipples, her fingers trailed slowly down the curve of Rio’s thigh. The touch was enough to make Rio instinctively spread her legs wider, and Agatha paused to pull Rio closer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s body responded instantly, rising to meet her, one arm draping over Agatha’s shoulder as her head dipped forward. Agatha tilted her face upward, her hands steadying Rio as she shifted her closer to the edge of the counter. The intimacy of the moment deepened as Agatha felt the undeniable heat of Rio’s wetness pressed against her stomach, the sensation drawing a loud moan from her own lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s other hand found Agatha’s cheek, cupping it gently as she leaned in. Their mouths collided in a searing kiss, tongues tangling. The kiss was hungry, their breaths mingling as Agatha’s hands gripped Rio tighter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha wasted no time, her hand slipping between Rio’s thighs, her fingers finding her drenched heat. When she touched Rio’s center, the slickness was impossible to ignore, and the both of them moaned into the kiss, their sounds swallowed by each other’s mouths. Agatha’s fingers teased their way along Rio’s folds, moving in slow strokes before swirling in lazy circles over the sensitive bundle of nerves.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">No longer able to hold back, Agatha dragged her touch lower and slid two fingers inside Rio with a firm, smooth motion. She curled them just right, and Rio’s body jerked violently, her lips breaking away from Agatha’s as a wail escaped her throat.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha kept going, her fingers delving deeper, drawing Rio into every thrust relentlessly. Her pace quickened, her movements harder and more insistent, the sound of Rio’s ragged breaths and the breathy, gasped “Yes” spurring her on. Rio’s body was trembling, her eyes squeezed shut as the tension coiled tightly inside her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Open your eyes,” Agatha commanded, her voice breathless. She didn’t stop moving, her fingers burying in to Rio to her knuckles. “I want you to look at me when I make you come.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes snapped open, locking onto Agatha’s. The intensity in her gaze was enough to shatter Rio’s control. Agatha felt the unmistakable clench of Rio’s walls around her fingers, the tightening drawing a guttural cry from Rio. “Fuck!” Rio cried out, her release crashing over her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t let up, her movements coaxing every last tremor from Rio’s body. Rio’s eyes fluttered closed again as she rode the aftershocks, her hips jerking to prolong the pleasure. Agatha stayed close, watching every reaction, her lips curving into a satisfied, almost wicked smile as Rio’s body finally stilled, spent and trembling in her arms.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha slowly withdrew her fingers, slick and glistening, earning a whine from Rio at their loss.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> Rio’s lips were already parted, as if anticipating what came next, her breaths shallow and waiting. When Agatha brought her hand to Rio’s mouth, Rio leaned in without hesitation, her lips closing around Agatha’s fingers and taking them fully to the knuckle. Her eyes locked onto Agatha’s, unwavering, their intensity enough to make Agatha’s breath hitch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s tongue pressed flat against Agatha’s fingers, dragging slowly along their length before pulling back, her lips tight. She repeated the action twice more, her head bobbing with unhurried precision, the heat of her mouth leaving Agatha trembling by the time Rio finally let go.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s knees buckled, a wave of dizziness overtaking her. Her hands flew to Rio’s thighs to steady herself, her head dipping as she tried to catch her own breath. Then, with a tenderness that wrecked her completely, Rio cupped Agatha’s cheeks and pulled her into a soft, lingering kiss. The sweetness of it drew a whimper from Agatha’s lips, her resolve crumbling under the gentle pressure of Rio’s mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Agatha opened her eyes, Rio was already gazing down at her, a warmth in her expression that made Agatha feel like her entire body might fold in on itself. Rio’s brown hair, still damp and curling slightly at the ends, framed her face perfectly. It fell just at her shoulders, breathtaking in its simplicity. Her flawless skin glowed in the dim light, her natural beauty utterly captivating. Rio looked like sheer perfection, a vision of effortless beauty that made Agatha’s chest ache with longing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The three words that had been sitting at the back of her throat, unsaid since the moment Rio kissed her in front of the portal, now threatened to spill free. Agatha wasn’t sure if, once spoken, she’d ever be able to stop saying them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Agatha could think about anything else, she felt Rio shift, nudging her to step back and give her room to slide off the counter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The moment Rio’s feet touched the ground, her hand shot out, hooking around the back of Agatha’s neck. Rio pulled her into a kiss so consuming that Agatha swore it might finish the job and actually kill her this time. It was all Rio, her tongue sweeping into Agatha’s mouth with no hesitation, claiming her completely. Agatha moaned at the lingering taste of Rio on her tongue. <br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s head spun with the force of it. The kiss was wild and consuming, sending them stumbling out of the bathroom. Rio’s hands clawed and squeezed greedily at Agatha’s ass as they moved.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They barely made it a few steps before their momentum carried them into the wall, Agatha’s back meeting the surface with a thud. Rio’s hands moved everywhere, clawing, gripping, and exploring Agatha’s body like she couldn’t get enough. Their breaths were heavy and desperate, filling the space between fevered kisses.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, just as suddenly, Rio stopped.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a frustrated grunt, her lips chasing after Rio’s, but Rio ignored her protests. Instead, she grabbed Agatha’s hand, her grip firm and guided her to the edge of the bed. Letting go, Rio placed her hands gently on Agatha’s waist and turned her so the back of her legs brushed against the bed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio brought one hand up, resting it against Agatha’s sternum. Her touch was steady but insistent as she pressed Agatha back just enough to make her sit.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And Agatha was fucking sat.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio looked down at her, and the intensity in her gaze said everything. There was no hesitation and no doubt. Her expression was one of pure possession, a silent promise that Agatha belonged to her just as much as Rio belonged to Agatha. It was a look that sent shivers through her, a gaze so full of adoration, hunger, and unwavering devotion that it made Agatha feel like the only person in existence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without breaking eye contact, Rio dropped to her knees, her movements fluid and deliberate. Rio tilted her head slightly to look up at Agatha, her eyes dark and full of purpose. Agatha’s breath caught in her throat as she stared down at the woman before her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">How could anyone think this connection, this sacred bond, was anything less than divine?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">In that moment, Agatha understood why people searched for proof of the divine their whole lives. She never had the desire to find it, but it struck her like a revelation. It felt holy, almost too much to bear. And for the first time in her life and her death, Agatha believed in God.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">God was a woman. She was beautiful and powerful. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And currently, God was on her knees for Agatha Harkness.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They fucked all night like their lives depended on it, their passion igniting and rekindling what centuries apart had starved them of. Each of them reclaimed every inch of the other’s body, rediscovering every curve, every scar, every place they had longed to touch again. At times it was slow, achingly tender, their gazes locked with unspoken words of devotion passing between them. Other times, full of fire, fury, and a hunger so primal it felt sinful. They became lost in each other, in the rhythm of their bodies, in the heat of their skin, leaving no moment untouched and no need unmet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At one point, Agatha sat up against the headboard, her back supported by the cool wood, her gaze focused downward at the woman resting in her lap.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s head was cradled against her thighs, her dark eyes gazing up at her like Agatha herself had hung the moon. Agatha’s fingers trailed through Rio’s hair absentmindedly, the soft strands slipping between her fingers. They were still entirely naked, their bodies pressed close yet seemingly untouched by the chaos of the night.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s lips twitched with frustration as her gaze swept over their unmarked skin. The hickeys, claw marks, and bruises they had left on each other had already vanished, their bodies healing far too quickly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha fucking hated it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She wanted the evidence of her love, her need, to linger on Rio’s skin. She wanted the marks to scream that Rio was hers, to remind them both of everything they had taken back tonight. It had been the same all those years ago, the infuriating consequence of Rio’s power. Now, in her ghostly afterlife, the same curse applied to Agatha, her own body just as infuriatingly pristine.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha would have seethed at the thought if she weren’t so utterly distracted. Rio’s lazy finger traced an unhurried circle around one of Agatha’s nipples, her touch light and teasing. It was enough to pull Agatha’s thoughts back to the present, her breath hitching at the sensation. She looked down at Rio, and the satisfied smirk on her face told her that Rio knew exactly what she was doing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Suddenly, Rio moved, sitting up and slipping out of the bed without a word. Agatha blinked, stunned, as she watched Rio stride across the room. Her ass was illuminated softly in the low light as she crouched by her duffle bag, rummaging through its contents.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha leered. Sue her. What else was she supposed to do when Rio’s ass was on full display, practically begging for attention?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio finally found what she was looking for, she turned back to Agatha with a smug smile playing on her lips. Without hesitation, she tossed the item effortlessly into Agatha’s lap.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze dropped to the object now resting perfectly in the center of her lap. A fucking purple strap-on.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a moment, Agatha just stared at it, her mind struggling to process. Then she closed her eyes, throwing one hand dramatically over her heart while the other extended upward, her fingers splayed toward the heavens. In a hushed tone, Agatha mumbled a prayer of thanks to whatever god or higher power had deemed her worthy of this moment.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Though, Agatha knew exactly who she was thanking. It was the woman standing across from her with her tongue poking into her cheek.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At dawn, they found themselves in the lounge chairs outside, the horizon painted in soft hues of pink and gold as the sun prepared to rise. The air was crisp, cool enough to justify the sweats and hoodies they now wore, a stark contrast to the heat they had shared for hours before. They sat in comfortable silence, waiting for the first rays of sunlight to spill over the edge of the world.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze was drawn to the ocean, its vastness stretching endlessly before them. She had never truly understood its wonder until now, the way it seemed alive, breathing and shifting with rhythm. The waves moved with power, a reminder of something eternal and untamable. She marveled at it, captivated by the way the water mirrored the sky, reflecting infinite possibilities.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She wanted to dive into it, to feel its cool embrace and let it pull her wherever it wanted. There was a strange sense of trust Agatha felt now, an acceptance of the ocean’s call. It was more than just water. It was a force, a mystery, a promise of freedom that spoke to something deep inside her. If Agatha allowed it, she knew she could follow its pull forever, surrendering to its currents, letting it carry her to places unknown, unbound by the constraints of time or fear.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha glanced over at Rio, who sat with her knees tucked to her chest, arms draped loosely around them. Rio’s hair was pulled into a loose bun at the nape of her neck, with her curtain bangs neatly tucked behind her ears.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Rio looked at the ocean with just as much wonder.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words left Agatha’s lips. There was no hesitation and no second guessing. She said them with purpose. She meant every word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I love you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t respond right away. She actually froze, her body going perfectly still as if the words themselves had taken the air from her lungs. Slowly, Rio turned to look at Agatha, her face almost unreadable as those brown eyes scanned every inch of Agatha’s expression. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was searching for any crack or any sign of doubt. But all she found was inevitable truth, and Agatha saw when it hit Rio, it looked like a wave crashing into her chest and stealing the ground beneath her feet.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s brow furrowed slightly, and she shook her head like she was trying to clear her thoughts. Finally, she met Agatha’s gaze fully, her voice soft but sure, “I love you too.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt the weight of Rio’s words, the honesty in every syllable, and Agatha’s lips curved into a small smile. Agatha turned her attention back to the horizon, watching as the sun began to crest over the ocean, spilling golden light over the water. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But she didn’t miss the way Rio’s eyes stayed fixed on her instead of the sunrise, as if she were trying to memorize every detail of Agatha’s face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And Agatha definitely didn’t miss the way Rio’s lips twitched, fighting a smile so radiant it might have rivaled the dawn itself. Agatha could feel the warmth of that almost smile even without looking, and when Rio finally gave in, letting it bloom fully, she quickly turned her head away. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha caught the moment Rio tried to hide her happiness, but she didn’t need to see it to feel it. It was there, as inevitable as the sun rising in front of them.</span>

<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The sound of the back door sliding open shattered the stillness, followed by the unmistakable sound of Sage’s hurried footsteps. Agatha and Rio exchanged a fleeting look, frozen.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The footsteps grew louder, closer. Sage was seconds away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And then she appeared, stepping into the living room, only to stop dead in her tracks. Her expression twisted into one of pure, unfiltered horror.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What the- ? Oh, GOD!” Sage yelled, slapping both hands over her eyes like she’d just stumbled onto the scene of an unspeakable crime. She took a single staggering step back before dropping to the floor with the grace of a fainting goat, curling into a dramatic fetal position.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“MY EYES! MY SWEET, INNOCENT VIRGIN EYES!” she wailed, rocking back and forth as if physically pained. “I’LL NEVER RECOVER FROM THIS!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha blinked, her brows furrowing as she glanced at Rio, who looked just as bewildered. They both sat on opposite ends of the couch, very much </span> <span class="s2">not</span> <span class="s1"> in a compromising position.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sage!” Rio yelled, her expression twisting into one of absolute mortification. “What the fuck?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Don’t play dumb!” Sage shouted from her place on the floor, hands still firmly clamped over her eyes. “I saw-“ She paused, peeking through her fingers just enough to take another look.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her gaze darted from Agatha to Rio, seated innocently on the couch with at least a cushion’s worth of distance between them. There was no disheveled clothing, no flushed faces, no telltale signs of scandal. Just two women blinking back at her, looking utterly bewildered. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh,” Sage muttered simply, scrambling to her feet in an awkward rush and brushing herself off as if nothing had happened. A flicker of frustration crossed her face, her lips pressing into a thin line as she glanced between Agatha and Rio, who were still staring at her in confusion. Her behavior was erratic, yes. But her disappointment was glaringly obvious.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha narrows her eyes, the pieces clicking into place almost instantly. After their conversation yesterday, she should’ve seen this coming.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage had fully expected to catch them… what? Rekindling? Canoodling? Agatha wasn’t entirely sure, but one thing was clear: Sage had been hoping for a breakthrough, one dramatic enough to shove her parents back together.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha cast a sidelong glance at Rio, whose confusion hadn’t yet melted into understanding. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">To Agatha it was clear as day, the parent trapping plot was written all over Sage’s face. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Well, Agatha sure as hell wasn’t going to be the one to tell Sage that maybe, her little scheme had worked. Instead, she pressed her lips into a thin line and crossed her arms, choosing silence over acknowledgment.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage, completely unfazed by the lingering awkwardness in the room, shifted gears without missing a beat. “Are you two ready to go whale watching?” she asked, as though nothing unusual had transpired just moments ago.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s brow furrowed deeply, her confusion only growing as she glanced between Sage and Agatha. She opened her mouth as if to speak, then closed it, her thoughts clearly spinning. After a moment, she managed to ask, “You said the tickets were for one in the afternoon, right?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Correct,” Sage replied with a calm, matter of fact tone.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio gestured wildly toward the clock on the wall in disbelief, “It is eight in the morning, Sage. Why would we be ready to leave now?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha, meanwhile, pressed a hand to her mouth, attempting to mask a faint smile that threatened to break free. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was a rare sight to see Rio thrown for a loop. She was always so calm, so unshakable, as if nothing in the world could surprise her. It had always been difficult to catch her off guard. Agatha had prided herself on being the one person capable of doing it, the one who could needle her just enough to provoke a reaction.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But now there was Sage, stepping into the role with an ease that made Agatha smirk. Watching her daughter leave Rio blinking and speechless was more satisfying than Agatha cared to admit. Sage had somehow inherited that sharp, incisive edge Agatha had always prided herself on, and she wielded it effortlessly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage was everything Agatha had been and more, a force all her own, one that left even Rio scrambling to keep up. She couldn’t help but marvel at the chaos she and Rio had somehow managed to create together.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Uhhhhh because we need to be at the dock by 12:45,” Sage said, her voice carrying the faintest hint of condescension. She raised her eyebrows and tilted her head ever so slightly, her lips pressing together in a way that made it abundantly clear she thought the answer was glaringly obvious.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose, letting out a long, exaggerated breath. “That doesn’t make any sense,” she muttered under her breath.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“It does if you value the art of punctuality,” Sage quipped, her tone laced with mockery. Agatha could see the faint smirk on Sage’s face starting to form. Sage folded her arms with an air of triumph like her logic was not only flawless but also painfully obvious to anyone with half a brain.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sank deeper into the couch, biting down on her knuckle in a lame attempt to stifle her laughter. Her shoulders shook ever so slightly as she cast a glance at Rio, whose narrowed eyes were fixed on their daughter with the intensity of someone trying to remain calm but failing miserably.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio spoke slowly, the words carefully measured. “Okay. And what exactly are we supposed to do when we get there two and a half hours early? Hmm? Stand around and admire the dock?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“There’s a bookstore I want to go to in town,” Sage said casually, as if her plan was perfectly reasonable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s expression shifted instantly. She mustered up the fakest smile imaginable, her lips stretching unnaturally as she gritted through her teeth, “Perfect.” The word dripped with forced enthusiasm. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha decided it was time to intervene. Rio clearly needed a moment to breathe, and steering the conversation away from the current chaos seemed like the best option. “So,” she asked casually, “how was arguing Aristotle?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage perked up immediately, her face lighting with amusement. “Oh, well, there wasn’t much arguing if you get what I me-”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><em>Wrong question</em>! Agatha had asked the </span> <span class="s2">wrong fucking</span> <span class="s1"> question.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Sage could even finish her sentence, Rio’s hands slapped over her ears, and she yelled, “LA LA LA LA!” in a desperate attempt to block out whatever horrifying implication was about to follow.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At the same time, Agatha’s face twisted in disgust as she shouted, “Oh now, that’s disgusting!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Sage had already spun on her heel, darting toward the stairs with all the subtlety of a stampede. “I’ll be ready in 20!” she called over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio groaned, pinching the bridge of her nose as she watched Sage disappear up the steps. With a slow, deliberate turn, she fixed Agatha with a pointed look. “Your daughter.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> “She’s yours when she’s being annoying.” Agatha lied. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As soon as Rio put the car in park, Sage flung the door open and power walked toward the bookstore. The small beach town had a quaint charm, with a single main road lined with white brick front shops and wooden signs swinging gently in the breeze. The street was quiet, save for the occasional passerby and the hum of distant conversation, as if time moved just a little slower here.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Things hadn’t felt strange between them since their quiet admissions that morning, the things they had shared with each other. They moved around one another gracefully, as if they were perfectly in sync, navigating the space between them with ease. But it had been quiet- not an uncomfortable quiet, just quieter than Agatha would have liked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha would never consider herself to be needy. She prided herself on her independence, on her ability to stand alone and thrive without anyone to lean on. And it wasn’t that Agatha </span> <span class="s2">needed</span> <span class="s1"> Rio, exactly, but she wanted her, in a way that felt deeper, more permanent, and far more vulnerable than she cared to admit.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The quiet between them wasn’t bad, not really. But Agatha found herself longing to hear Rio speak, even if it was just meaningless chatter. She wanted to hear her laugh, to watch her face light up when she spoke about something she loved. Maybe it was selfish, maybe it was ridiculous. Agatha couldn’t shake the feeling that she’d been starving for far too long for something only Rio could give her- and now that she had it, she wanted more. Desperately, endlessly, more.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio wore a black spaghetti strap tank top tucked into tight jeans, her white tennis shoes clean and understated. Her hair was down, falling in soft waves that framed her face, and Agatha found herself momentarily distracted, her chest tightening at how effortlessly good Rio looked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha, on the other hand, had opted for a loose fitting white shirt, casually tucked into a pair of khaki linen beach pants that skimmed her ankles. The fabric swayed lightly with each step, her sandals completing the effortlessly relaxed look. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha moved on autopilot as she got out of the car, slinging her purse over her shoulder. She paused on the sidewalk, watching Rio cross in front of her and reach for the door to hold it open. Pride stickers adorned the sidelights, their colors faded but vibrant against the glass.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Inside, the bookstore had a cozy, lived in charm. Wooden shelves, slightly worn at the edges, stretched from floor to ceiling, packed with books of every genre. A mismatched collection of chairs and small tables sat near the windows, where warm light poured in. The faint scent of coffee and old paper lingered in the air, mixing with the quiet hum of soft music playing overhead. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio brushed past her, seemingly on a mission of her own, while Agatha happily turned her attention to the shelves, content to browse. She had no idea where Sage had wandered off to, only a few minutes later, she turned into an aisle and froze.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There was Rio, clear as day, standing in front of a shelf with a book in her left hand and her obnoxious dagger in the other, carving something into the cover. She was quietly cackling to herself, the kind of laugh that sent a chill down your spine for no reason at all.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hesitated, torn between retreating to avoid whatever mischief Rio was up to or indulging her curiosity. Agatha didn’t consider herself nosy, not really. But as someone who once prided herself on knowing all the neighborhood gossip, she felt a certain obligation to investigate. After all, who was she if not a woman who honored tradition? It was practically her duty.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Crossing her arms, she strolled casually toward Rio, her eyes drifting over the bookshelves as though she was simply browsing and not keeping Rio firmly in her peripheral vision. When she reached Rio, she leaned back against the shelf behind her, positioning herself to face Death head on. Still feigning indifference, she let her eyes flick down to the book in Rio’s hands.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She already had a good idea of what it would be, so when Agatha saw the familiar portrait of Emily Dickinson on the cover, she wasn’t the least bit surprised. Rio had already carved X’s over Dickinson’s eyes and was now carefully adding devil horns to her head.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s face immediately twisted into a silent grimace. Lips pressed tight, teeth bared ever so slightly, it was the universal expression for yikes. She raised an eyebrow at Rio, waiting to see how far this particular masterpiece would go.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That situation had happened long ago, centuries in fact. Agatha was hazy on the exact dates, but she had always favored Massachusetts. It was where she felt her most wicked. For years, she wandered from town to town, never staying long. Her routine was simple. She would arrive, play a role, cause trouble, and then leave.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But she always returned to Massachusetts. Every decade, every era, without fail, Agatha would find herself returning to that cursed, irresistible place.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This was a particular hiccup in time that Death chose not to collect, ignoring Agatha entirely. Usually, Agatha never saw Rio, but when she snuck her way back to the aftermath of her chaos, she would find a flower resting atop a body. It was a quiet reminder that Rio could play her game just as well as Agatha could. Sometimes, weeks, months, even years passed without so much as a trace of her, but Agatha could feel every effort Rio made to find her, every trace of energy that reached out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That pull had faded with time.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was about a hundred years after Rio and Nicky, and she was far from stable. Agatha was off her mother fucking rockers. Rio’s silence this time had stretched Agatha far too thin. The absence became unbearable, an ache she couldn’t ignore. She needed to do something bigger, something more dramatic, something impossible to ignore. And as fate would have it, she got lucky. Amherst fell right into her lap.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stayed for a while, settling in briefly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was there that she heard the rumors. A woman in town who claimed to be in love with Death. Agatha overheard the woman talking to a friend, describing Death as someone who had picked her up in a chariot and carried her through life into eternity.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">How fucking romantic. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The poem referred to Death as a man, but the way the woman spoke about it felt suspiciously familiar. Fruity, some would say. It sounded like Rio and Agatha couldn’t ignore the possibility. Of course, Rio would find someone new eventually. She couldn’t stay alone forever, right? Except Agatha thought she absolutely should. The idea of Rio falling for sweet words and poetic gestures stung.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had always been a fool for words, but usually only one person’s.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha told herself she had plenty of reasons to interfere, though she barely believed half of them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Reason one. Death was not a lover. Death was cruel and unforgiving. It stole time and left nothing behind but pain. Agatha clung to that belief because it kept her fire alive. It was easier to focus on that than the vows she had made and the love she had tried to bury. Even while hidden by the Darkhold, Rio’s pull had burned through.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Reason two. Death was already spoken for. If Agatha had chosen to walk away, then no one else could have Rio either. Agatha made sure of that. Through the centuries, she left her mark- sometimes love notes, sometimes cruel reminders. Piled bodies and lingering chaos were declarations that she was always near, a message only Rio would understand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At times, Agatha softened her touch, leaving subtle traces, like the faint whisper of her magic on the wind or the flicker of a familiar flower Rio would recognize. Other times, she was merciless, painting her presence in blood and fire, daring Rio to try and reach her. It was all deliberate.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She would occasionally lift the veil of the Darkhold, just enough for Rio to sense her. It was never enough to find her, only enough to tease, to draw Rio in and leave her grasping at nothing. Agatha relished the game, the push and pull, the way Rio would chase her only to find nothing but whispers of her presence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was love, it was cruelty, it was foreplay. Agatha told herself she was keeping Rio in check, reminding her of who she took from and who she belonged to. Never letting her forget.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But deep down, she knew it was her way of staying tethered to the one thing she couldn’t bring herself to fully let go of.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">So, with her jaw tight and fists clenched, Agatha approached the woman. Agatha smiled and offered compliments, playing her role perfectly. The woman soaked up every word with ease. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha saw it, clear as day, the charm, the wit, unafraid to defy the rules of her time… Agatha understood how Emily Dickinson caught Rio’s eye.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Knowing the appeal only made it worse, like adding fuel to a fire that Agatha already had no control over. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">So what did Agatha Harkness do? She befriended the woman. They talked endlessly, delving into questions that felt like staring into the abyss- existence, mortality, the nature of time. For Agatha, who had spent a century wrestling with those very thoughts, it was maddening how easily Emily voiced them, as if they were nothing more than thoughts needing to be written down. The hardest part wasn’t pretending to be interested. It was how Emily’s words lingered a little longer than Agatha would like to admit. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha played the part perfectly, letting her touch linger just long enough to blur the line between friendly and intimate. Those touches became bolder, escalating into kisses that left nothing unspoken. And before long, Emily Dickinson was in her bed, her curiosity about Death replaced with a fixation for Agatha herself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Emily Dickinson had a tendency to obsess on the shiny and new. It wouldn’t take long before poems were written, verses about a brown haired, blue eyed woman who disappeared into the night. Emily would swear she had seen her eyes flash purple for the briefest moment, as if an otherworldly power had slipped through. The poems would speak of how the woman seemed to carry an entire storm within her, power woven into every step and every glance.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Amherst had been the first town Agatha left without taking anything for herself. No power gained, no witches dead in her wake. The damage she left behind couldn’t be dismissed as grief or chaos. It was personal, something she could not justify or explain away. It was also the first time she felt Rio’s pull begin to fade, the connection between them loosening in a way she hadn’t anticipated but sure as fuck couldn’t ignore.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Now, here Agatha was, watching her ex-wife? Not ex? Wife? (She’d figure it out at some point). Meticulously carve devil horns onto a portrait of Emily Dickinson.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That thought sat uncomfortably with Agatha. Rio had given her a way out, a quiet suggestion that maybe it wasn’t all her fault, that perhaps Emily had played her part too. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">But Agatha knew the truth. After she left Amherst, she made sure her next pile of victims was left in a sprawling field of wildflowers, the kind Rio would never miss. It was calculated and the same fucked up love note fueled by manipulation to keep Rio on her tail: </span> <em> <span class="s2">I love you. I’m sorry.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Destroying a book? From a local business no less? Rio, you dog.” Agatha’s voice wavered, not quite edged with her usual confidence or teasing flirtation, but it got the point across.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Yeah, guess you could say I’m a bad boy,” Rio replied simply. She glanced up, raising her eyebrows, and leaned forward slightly, her lips twitching in amusement. Lowering her voice to a mockingly sultry tone, she whispered, “Heard you like those.” Her delivery was high pitched and playful.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hummed in response, her eyes narrowing faintly, more amused than annoyed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You know what? You’re right. I shouldn’t be vandalizing,” Rio said, straightening up and feigning seriousness. “I’ll just buy every copy of this book in the damn store, toss them all in a dumpster, and light the whole pile on fire.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I didn’t like the poems she wrote about you,” Agatha said abruptly. The words came out quieter, heavier, and far more honest than she had intended.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s playful smirk faltered, her eyes narrowing slightly as she tilted her head. “You didn’t like them?” she asked, her tone softer now.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha shook her head, refusing to look away. “No. I hated them,” she admitted, her voice trembling just enough to betray her. “I hated the way she wrote about you. Like she knew you. Like she understood you. She didn’t. Not the way I do.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s brow furrowed, and for a moment, she looked like she wanted to say something, but instead, she glanced to the side, her hand slipping to her sock as she pocketed the dagger. “They were nice, though. Kind,” she muttered, almost as if she were defending the poet. “I figured I’d… gift her for that kindness.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words sounded unsure, almost insecure, as Rio stepped closer. The distance between them disappeared in an instant, and she shoved the book back into the shelf beside Agatha’s head.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha rolled her eyes, staying exactly where she was, her arms still crossed. She felt Rio’s closeness like a challenge, her warmth brushing against her like an unspoken dare. Agatha’s lips twitched, threatening a smile she refused to give, so instead, she leaned forward and bumped her front against Rio’s in a playful nudge.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“A gift? Rio, you were wooing her,” Agatha said, her tone lighter now, teasing instead of accusatory. There was no malice in her words, just a playful humor that turned an ugly memory into something softer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I- I was not wooing her,” Rio stammered, caught off guard, though her lips were already curving into a grin.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh, you absolutely were,” Agatha countered, her grin growing as she raised a finger between them. “First of all, making a grand theatrical appearance. Horses. A chariot. Because she could not stop for Death, so you stopped for her.” She raised a second finger, her voice brimming with amusement. “Second of all, incredibly gay. And third, blatantly obvious wooing.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s grin widened, and she tilted her head smugly. “Were you jealous?” she asked, wiggling her eyebrows for emphasis.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a slow breath, her expression softening, though her eyebrows arched in mock challenge. “Yeah… I was,” she admitted, her voice dropping slightly. “Honored your vows, huh?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s smirk faded just enough for sincerity to creep into her voice. “I might’ve started wooing when I heard you were heading toward Amherst,” she said honestly. “But I had a moody preteen at home and an ex-wife to keep track of. It didn’t leave much time for anything else.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio leaned back slightly, grinning again as she says, “But lucky for you, I’m persistent. Eyes.” she raised two fingers and pointed at her own eyes. “Always on the prize,” aiming her fingers at Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s cheeks warmed as she smirked at Rio, her lips parting slightly as her gaze lingered. If someone had told her a year ago that she would be here, flirting with her… her… whatever Rio was to her now, she would have laughed in their face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And yet, here she was, standing in the middle of the gayest bookstore known to man, in some picturesque ocean side town. Somewhere nearby, her daughter was undoubtedly tucked in a corner, furiously reading another book copy of the same book Rio had just defaced, likely seeing it in an entirely new light. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha reached out, her fingers brushing against Rio’s arm before sliding up to the back of her neck. She closed the small distance between them with an easy pull, and Rio didn’t resist. The kiss that followed was soft, unhurried, and so unlike their past. It didn’t carry the heavy weight of regret or the aching pull of longing. There was no desperation, no burden of unspoken words or uncomfortably loaded meanings. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio pulled away first, her tongue poking into her cheek as she gave Agatha an amused once over. “Gonna go do some browsing,” she said, jutting a thumb over her shoulder as she started walking backward, her smirk unmistakable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stayed rooted against the shelf, turning her head to watch Rio go. Her thumb grazed her bottom lip, the stupidest grin plastered on her face. She felt like a lovesick idiot, still warm from the kiss, the weight of Rio’s presence lingering in the air.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“And maybe get into a brawl with Sage if I catch her reading that damn book,” Rio called over her shoulder, disappearing around the corner.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The second Rio was gone, Agatha turned back to the shelf, thunking her head lightly against it with a groan. “I’m becoming a fucking softy,” she muttered to herself, half in disbelief, half in resignation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She wandered the store aimlessly, dragging her fingers along shelves, running her hand over book spines and tabletops, feeling oddly weightless. Her smile refused to fade, leaving her feeling like she was floating somewhere between cloud nine and complete idiocy. Every so often, she caught herself grinning wider, and she had to shake her head to clear it, her cheeks still flushed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Turning a corner, she froze. The sight in front of her made her chest tighten. Without thinking, she ducked behind another aisle, heart pounding as she peered through the gaps in the books.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There was Rio, standing a little too close to a woman who clearly worked here. The woman was laughing at something Rio had said, leaning forward in that way people do when they’re overly interested. Her smile was too bright, her body language far too inviting, and Agatha felt her grip tighten on the shelf.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her eyes followed every movement, and then she saw it- the woman’s hand brushed against Rio’s arm as she laughed again. It wasn’t bold, not outwardly, but it was enough to make Agatha’s instincts flare. She jerked forward, her elbow accidentally knocking a few books from the shelf. They tumbled to the floor with a loud crash.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Both Rio and the woman snapped their heads toward the noise, but Agatha had already ducked down and slipped to the next aisle. She peeked through another gap, her jaw tightening as her eyes narrowed to inspect further.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio looked composed, respectful, like she was just having a normal conversation. Agatha knew Rio wasn’t the problem here. The problem was the woman who couldn’t seem to keep her eyes or hands to herself.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The employee’s eyes drifted lower, lingering on the bare skin of Rio’s chest for a moment too long. That alone set Agatha’s teeth on edge, but it wasn’t the worst part.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">What pissed Agatha off most was what happened next.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was like slow motion. Agatha watched as the woman’s gaze dropped to Rio’s left hand, following its every movement as Rio casually reached up to tuck a loose strand of hair behind her ear. The woman’s eyes even tracked the hand as it lowered again, back to her side.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t take it anymore. Fuming, she whipped away from the shelf, aggressively readjusting the strap of her purse on her shoulder. She mumbled angrily under her breath as she stomped toward the door, her footsteps heavy with irritation.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Once outside, she made a sharp left, storming past the window where she knew Rio and that overly friendly employee would be watching her every movement. Sure enough, their heads turned, following her furious path as she stomped out of view. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha was about to do something really fucking stupid, but she already knew she wouldn’t regret it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Three stores down, she turned sharply to the right, stomping up the narrow stairs to her destination. The bell above the door clanged aggressively as she shoved it open, her presence immediately commanding the small space. She scanned the store with fiery intensity, her gaze slicing through the air. The employee behind the counter froze under her glare, his nervous expression only fueling her determination. </span> <span class="s2"><em>Good</em>,</span> <span class="s1"> Agatha thought. </span> <em> <span class="s2">He should be scared.</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her eyes locked on her target. Without hesitation, she stormed to the counter, jabbing a finger toward the two items she wanted. “Those,” she barked, her tone leaving no room for negotiation. The employee stammered as he fumbled to package the items, but before they could finish, Agatha snapped, “No! I don’t need them in those. Just give them to me. I’ll carry them.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The employee paused, stammering that she still needed to pay first. Agatha’s glare doesn’t leave the employee as she dug into her small purse. She pulled out Rio’s wallet, yanked a card from it without bothering to check, and practically threw it at the counter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The employee muttered something about a loan or a payment plan, but Agatha’s voice cut him off. “No. Just swipe the fucking card.” She didn’t care what it cost. Rio wouldn’t care either.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The transaction dragged on longer than it had any right to. The machine beeped, whirred, and blinked, taking its sweet time processing the card. Agatha stood motionless, except for the sharp, rhythmic tapping of her finger against the glass counter. The sound filled the silence, a reminder of her growing impatience. Finally, the receipt printed, and the employee handed her the items with trembling hands.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha snatched them, her knuckles white as she gripped one tightly in her right hand and shoved the other into the pocket of her pants. She shoved the wallet back into her purse without a glance, spun on her heel, and stormed out of the store, the bell clanging violently in her wake.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha marched back to the bookstore, her jaw clenched and her fingers twisting the stupid thing around her finger as her frustration simmered. She was muttering under her breath, barely aware of her surroundings, her focus solely on the oblivious bookstore employee who clearly couldn’t read a room. By the time she reached the bookstore she threw a look to its window.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha paused. Rio and the bookstore employee were no longer standing at the window.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh, now that’s just rich,” she spat, her words punctuated by each angry step she took. By the time she reached the door, she was vibrating with pent up energy. Agatha inhaled deeply, summoning the biggest, most unsettlingly fake smile she could manage, and pushed the door open.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The bell rang as she entered, and the employee at the counter froze, her eyes widening as Agatha passed by with a manic gleam in her eye. She didn’t care. She had a mission.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At the back of the store, she spotted Rio sitting at a table, her brown eyes already locked on Agatha like she could sense the storm coming. Rio stood slowly, weaving her way around the table with her hands raised, trying to defuse whatever fury Agatha was bringing with her. Rio met her halfway down the aisle and lightly gripped Agatha’s elbow, her teeth gritted as she whispered, “My love, breathe.” Her gaze never left Agatha’s face, her tone calm and steady.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s eyebrows shot up, her voice dripping with mock innocence. “Huh? Whatever could you mean?” She reached into her pocket with one hand while pulling Rio’s hand off her elbow with the other. She didn’t look away, even as Rio’s confusion deepened.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Rio could react, Agatha slid the ring onto her left ring finger. Agatha watched closely, catching the exact moment Rio realized what was happening. Her head dipped to look at her hand just as Agatha started to pull away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The wedding band was gold, simple but elegant, with a black diamond as the centerpiece. Intricate ivy leaf engravings ran along the band, catching the light as Rio blinked, processing the weight of what she was seeing. Her eyes shot back up to Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I was under the impression that divorced spouses don’t usually wear rings,” Rio said slowly, wiggling her fingers as if testing the unfamiliar weight of the band.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I don’t remember signing divorce papers. Do you?” Agatha asked, her voice smooth, but her raised eyebrows dared Rio to argue.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“They didn’t exist back then,” Rio muttered.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What’s that?” Agatha asked, tilting her head with mock curiosity as if her logic had already won.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio opened her mouth to respond, but Agatha spun on her heel and shouted across the store, “Sage, grab your shit! Let’s go!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hey!” Rio hissed, trailing after Agatha as she moved toward the register. Rio sped up and darted around a table to block Agatha’s path. Her brow furrowed as she grabbed Agatha’s left hand, yanking it upward. “And where’s your collar, huh?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There it was. The simple silver ring with an oval-cut diamond sat snugly on Agatha’s finger.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha leaned in, whispering for no reason at all. “You were saying?” She snatched her hand back, staring Rio down as if daring her to object.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t respond. She turned and followed Agatha as she continued her march to the register.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio tried to walk right past the counter, Agatha grabbed her arm and dragged her back beside her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hello!” Agatha said with exaggerated enthusiasm that made her own skin crawl. She reached into a nearby cup and grabbed a handful of overpriced stickers. “I’ll take these!” she announced, then turned to gesture at Rio standing stiffly next to her. “For my wife.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Agatha, sweetheart, don’t scare the nice lady. You’re misreading the situation,” Rio said through gritted teeth, her voice low and measured, trying to keep calm despite the fact the woman they were talking about was standing right in front of them. Agatha felt Rio’s left hand press gently against her back, a quiet attempt to ground her- or maybe to hold her in place before she did something drastic.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s smile stretched wider, almost unnervingly so, her teeth clenched as she matched Rio’s tone with unsettling sweetness. “Oh, she’s lucky I didn’t rip her fucking throat out.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The fake smile never wavered until they were all startled by the sudden sound of a yelp and books crashing to the floor. Agatha, Rio, and the employee whipped their heads toward Sage, who was standing frozen, her hands clasped over her mouth. Her wide green eyes darting back and forth between on the shiny ring on Agatha’s hand and the one on Rio’s hand that still rested on Agatha’s lower back. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha raised her hand, lifting one finger as she said, “Not a single word. Pick up your shit and put it on the counter so your mother can pay for it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage scrambled to gather her things, doing as she was told, her face bright with excitement. Agatha knew that as Sage placed the books on the counter, the younger woman mentally congratulated herself. Sage just got a front row seat to her parent trapping scheme finally paying off.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha handed Rio her wallet with a curt movement, sparing only a single glance at her as Rio complied without question. Rio’s expression betrayed the faintest flicker of amusement, though she kept her lips pressed into a thin line, clearly trying to stay neutral despite Agatha’s theatrics.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The employee scrambled to bag the items, her hands fumbling slightly as she worked to move as quickly as possible under the weight of Agatha’s unrelenting presence. Once the bag was handed to Sage, their daughter bolted for the door without hesitation, leaving Rio a few steps behind, hovering near the exit. Rio paused, her hand lifting to beckon Agatha toward the door, her expression practically pleading for this to end.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Agatha wasn’t done. That wicked smile stayed plastered on her face as she pointed at Rio with dramatic flair. “My wife, buying shit for our daughter,” she said. Agatha started to move, but then she stopped again, throwing over her shoulder, “The daughter we share.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio gave her a pointed look, but before she could usher Agatha out, Agatha turned one last time, the smile on her face sharpening into something colder. “Oh, and a son. Who’s dead.” The words didn’t sting as she said them; they weren’t meant to. They were meant to pierce the random woman, to twist the knife of discomfort deeper. Maybe it was also a reminder to Rio, a vocal declaration that Agatha acknowledges Rio as Nicky’s mother.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio finally moved, stepping forward to gently grab Agatha’s elbow, her grip firm but careful as she guided Agatha out of the bookstore.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As they stepped onto the street, Rio leaned in close, her lips brushing against Agatha’s ear as she muttered, soft and sweet, “You have no idea how hard I’m going to fuck you after that stunt.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze, the words stopping her in her tracks as Rio’s grip tugged her back slightly. For a moment, they were face to face, their stances unwavering, neither willing to break first. Agatha leaned in, so close their noses nearly brushed, her voice dropping into a dangerous whisper. “Looking forward to it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">With that, she spun on her heel with a dramatic flip of her hair and marched toward the docks, her steps purposeful, her head high. Behind her, Rio lingered for a moment, a smirk tugging at the corners of her lips before she followed.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
<p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Three days after Nicky’s birth:</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Agatha had found a quiet clearing deep in the forest, a secluded place to rest for what remained of the day. Nicky slept soundly in a woven basket she’d discovered the night after his birth. She hadn’t needed to guess who had left it. Inside was a single lotus flower. The sight of it had sent fury tearing through her chest. She didn’t need Rio, her gestures, or her pity. She needed her son to live.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><em>Her first instinct had been to destroy the basket, to rip it apart and grind the flower into the dirt. But she hadn’t. Not because of sentiment or nostalgia, but because the basket gave her something she desperately needed. A place to lay him down, a moment to breathe when the weight of it all threatened to crush her</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><em>When those moments came, she would sit beside him and watch. His tiny chest rose and fell in perfect rhythm, his every breath a quiet miracle. For a while, she could lose herself in him. The world’s cruelty faded; her wife’s cruelty faded. For a while, there was only him, and in those precious moments, nothing else mattered</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Then the faint crunch of leaves shattered the peace. Agatha froze, her body tensing as she turned. And there she was. Ten feet away. That green dress, once a thing of beauty, clung to her form like a ghost. Now it wasn’t beautiful. Now it was a shroud, steeped in everything Agatha had come to despise.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">It hurt to look at Rio. It always hurt, and no matter how much time passed, it always would. There was no seeing her without feeling the sharp edge of betrayal, the suffocating shadow of Death that clung to her like smoke.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Agatha moved without thinking, placing herself between the bassinet and Rio. Her body braced against the surge of fear and fury. Rio was not coming any closer. Not to him. Not ever.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Rio took a step forward. Agatha’s chest tightened as her hand shot up. “Stop,” she snapped, her voice trembling with the weight of her fear. “Don’t take another step.”</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Rio froze. Agatha saw the hurt flash across her face, the way her lips parted as though the words had physically struck her. Disbelief settled in her eyes, as though she couldn’t understand why Agatha would fear her.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">How dare she?</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Agatha’s stomach twisted, her anger sharpening into something harder, colder. How dare she look wounded, as if she were the one who had been wronged? Agatha straightened, grounding herself in the raw fury that had kept her standing for so long. Rio had no right to be here. No right to see him. No right to pretend she cared after everything she had done.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Agatha’s heart pounded in her chest, her mind a storm of rage and grief. Then Rio spoke, and it stopped her cold.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">“I- I promise… I won’t get too close. I won’t touch a thing… Yo-.. You won’t even know I’m there.”</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Agatha had prepared herself for pleading, for arguments, for the entitled insistence she had come to expect from Rio. But this wasn’t that. Rio’s voice was broken, trembling. There was no defiance, no demand. Only desperation.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">“Please,” she said, her voice breaking. “Just don’t hide him from me.”</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><em>It wasn’t a request for forgiveness or a plea for another chance. It was smaller than that. Just to see him. To be near, even from a distance</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Agatha’s breath hitched. She wanted to stay angry, to hold onto the fire that was keeping her alive. But the way Rio stood there- trembling, holding herself back like she was terrified to even breathe too close- struck a nerve she hadn’t expected.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Rio wasn’t just afraid. She was terrified. Of herself. Of what she was. Of what might happen if she got too close. The realization hit Agatha like a fucking bus. Rio wasn’t the woman she had loved, the woman she had built her world around. Rio was broken. A ghost of herself, consumed by fear and regret.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Agatha’s throat tightened as she looked between Rio and Nicky. For days, she had clung to the belief that shutting Rio out was the right thing, the safe thing. But now, with Rio standing there trembling at the edge of the clearing, she didn’t see Death.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">She saw a mother.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">A mother who was desperate, shattered, and begging for even the smallest piece of what she had lost. And for a moment, Agatha’s anger faltered, the edges of it softening against the raw ache in Rio’s voice.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">“I don’t want to see your face.”</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">For seven years, she allowed Rio to watch. Agatha never saw her, but she felt her presence, always lingering just beyond the edge of her awareness. Sometimes it was the faintest shift in the air, the slightest rustle of leaves where there was no wind. Other times, it was heavier, like the weight of a shadow pressing against her back. Agatha didn’t acknowledge it, not even to herself. But she knew.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Rio never crossed the invisible line Agatha had drawn, never dared to get too close. Whether it was fear or respect, Agatha didn’t know and didn’t care. All that mattered was that Nicky was safe, untouched by Death’s hands. </span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Except, he looked exactly like Rio.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">It was the cruelest twist of fate, a reminder that Agatha could never escape. Every time she looked at Nicky, she saw her. </span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">It wasn’t fair. How could someone so pure, so perfect, carry the face of the one person who had shattered her? Agatha had tried, desperately, to find herself in him, to see some flicker of her own reflection. But no matter how closely she searched, it was Rio staring back at her. </span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Agatha hated it. Hated how much it hurt. Hated that there were moments when she had to look away because it felt like she was drowning in grief all over again.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">It wasn’t Nicky’s fault. None of it was. But it was too awful, too overwhelming, to think of him as Rio’s son. A son born of Death. The idea of it sent a chill down her spine, cold and unrelenting. She would spend years telling herself that Nicky was her miracle, her reason to keep going, and he was. But the truth she buried, the truth she couldn’t speak, was that he was also her greatest heartache.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">Because no matter how much she tried to deny it, Rio was there. In him. In the way he moved, in the way he smiled, in the way he looked at her with those dark, searching eyes. And it tore her apart in ways she could never explain, in ways she would never let anyone see.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em>
<span class="s1">So Agatha clung to the only thing she could control. She would never call Rio his mother. She would never give her that. Nicky was hers, hers alone, and no one- not even Rio, standing silently in the shadows- would take that from her. Not ever.</span>
</em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha watched as Sage unapologetically pushed her way past children on their walk to the docks. She was on a mission, her determination to be first in line burning with singular focus. Rio walked behind Agatha at a leisurely pace, looking entirely unconcerned as Sage bulldozed through the crowd like a force of nature.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage hurried ahead, but when they arrived, the line was nonexistent. She stopped abruptly, turning back to Agatha with an expectant look.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Wallet,” she demanded, holding out her hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha scoffed, rummaging through her bag before pulling out the wallet and handing it over. Sage snatched it, paid for the tickets, and passed them to the booth attendant before the group boarded the vessel.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Inside, a small bar dominated the back wall of the cabin, surrounded by a sea of chairs neatly arranged in rows. Booths lined the edges along the windows, offering cozy spots to take in the view, while doors at either end led out to the open front deck.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha immediately found the closest chair she could and sank into it with a tired sigh. Rio, meanwhile, stopped at the bar, casually chatting with the bartender. A moment later, she joined Agatha, dropping into the seat beside her and handing over a cold beer without saying a word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And then, there it was again, that strange silence. It wasn’t unnatural, but unsettling in a way Agatha couldn’t ignore.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha studied Rio carefully, noting the way her fingers toyed with the ring on her hand and how her gaze stayed downcast. Something was off, though she couldn’t quite place it. It didn’t feel like anger or sadness, but something more subdued, almost restless. The unfamiliarity of it gnawed at Agatha, stirring a quiet tension that made her hesitate to speak. Whatever it was, it felt like uncharted ground, and Agatha wasn’t sure how far she wanted to tread.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“How are you doing?” Agatha asked abruptly, the words spilling out before she could stop herself. She hadn’t asked Rio that since this whole mess started, too wrapped up in her own feelings to even think about it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio blinked, clearly caught off guard. Her fingers paused mid spin on the ring as she glanced at Agatha. “I’m… fine,” she said, though her tone lacked conviction.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">So… Rio wasn’t going to give in that easily and that’s fine.. she guesses. She’d get it out of her eventually but she wouldn’t poke and prod it out of Rio, not like she use to. Where she would jab and jab till Rio frustratedly give in. No Agatha would try a new approach. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What’s that thing where someone starts a conversation with ‘I feel this’ or ‘I feel that,’ like it’s supposed to mean something?” Agatha asked, her brow furrowed in thought. “Is that… a thing people do now?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio smirked, tilting her head slightly. “They’re called </span>
<span class="s2">I statements.</span>
<span class="s1"> It’s something they use in therapy.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha groaned, slumping back in her chair. “Of course! Leave it to therapy to turn basic conversation into homework.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It might have been a mistake, but Agatha didn’t care. She would do whatever it took to keep Rio talking, even if it meant resorting to something like a therapy tactic. The thought made her cringe. Agatha had never imagined she would lower herself to something so forced or artificial, but desperate times called for desperate measures. Three hundred years of silence had been more than enough, and she wouldn’t let history repeat itself. Real issue or not, Agatha refused to let anything linger unspoken between them. They had wasted too much time already, and Rio deserved more than her stubbornness. They both did.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">So when Rio didn’t respond, her gaze falling back to that damn beer bottle she hadn’t even taken a sip from, Agatha decided to take the leap. “Okay, I’ll start… I feel…” The words barely left her mouth before she gagged, like actually gagged, the sound startling even her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio looked up, an amused smirk tugging at the corner of her lips. “Are you good?” she asked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha waved a hand, gathering her composure with a sharp inhale. “I’m fine,” she muttered, clearing her throat. She straightened in her seat, trying again. “I feel like I want you to tell me what’s wrong.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I feel like… nothing’s wrong.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha whipped around toward Rio, her body taut with restrained frustration. The words were on the tip of her tongue- </span>
<em>
<span class="s2">Then why aren’t you talking to me?</span>
</em>
<span class="s1">- sharp and biting, ready to cut through the silence. But instead, she caught herself, drawing in a slow, steadying breath. She exhaled just as slowly and turned forward in her seat again, forcing her voice to remain even.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I feel like that’s not true,” she said, quieter now but no less firm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio hesitated again, then finally spoke, her voice soft. “I feel… like I’m afraid to say the wrong thing.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s chest tightened, panic creeping in as the words left her mouth before she could stop them. “And I feel if you’re trying to break up with me, I’ll fling myself off this fucking boat, and you’ll have to explain to our daughter why I tried to die a second time.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s head snapped up, her eyes wide. “What? No! Agatha, that’s not- ” she stopped herself, taking a deep breath,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>“That’s not what this is.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Then what is it, because you’re making me-“ Agatha stopped and groaned as she slid down in her chair and pinched the bridge of her nose, “I feel like I’ve missed something important. And I’m trying to be patient, I really am, but I feel like an idiot.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio waited a long moment before responding, “I feel like I’m struggling with a bit of imposter syndrome,” she said, her voice barely audible.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tilted her head, her eyes narrowing slightly. “I feel like you need to explain.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio huffed a breath that wasn’t quite a laugh and looked up at the ceiling. Her jaw clenched as she stared upward, and her lips pursed as though she was holding something back. She looked like she was trying not to cry, but the frustration in her eyes was louder than any tears. After a long pause, she finally dropped her gaze, her attention falling to the beer in her hands again. Her fingers picked at the label, her voice shaking when she spoke again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I feel like I’m struggling to believe that I’m an actual person,” she admitted.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha blinked, her frown deepening. “What?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s lips twitched, her head lowering further as though she could hide the words even after they were out. “I feel like a concept personified,” she said. “Not a person. Not really.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could see it- the way Rio was slipping further into herself, struggling to untangle who she was from Death. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio wasn’t just sharing her thoughts; she was silently asking Agatha to save her from them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She had seen that look in Rio’s eyes before, the silent plea hidden beneath layers of frustration and sadness. Rio would never come out and ask for reassurance, but Agatha could tell she was desperate for someone to say it out loud. To remind Rio that she was more than what she feared. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t the first time she’d seen Rio like this. Agatha thought back to the clearing after Nicky’s birth, when Rio had stood there trembling, asking for permission to stay close. Rio hadn’t needed permission, not really. What she’d needed was reassurance, someone to tell her she wasn’t dangerous, wasn’t a walking curse that shattered everything she touched.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hadn’t given her that. She hadn’t reassured Rio. Instead, she had fed into the very belief Rio was drowning in now: that she was something broken, something unworthy of love.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s chest tightened at the memory. She couldn’t do that again. Not this time.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Look at me,” Agatha said gently, her voice steady but warm.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s gaze flicked up, hesitant but unwavering.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I don’t care what you were or how you started. You’re not some abstract concept or cosmic force. You’re a person. You have thoughts, feelings, choices. You laugh at fart jokes even when they’re not funny-”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Fart jokes are always funny,” Rio interjected with a ghost of a smirk.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Not the point.” Agatha’s lips twitched, fighting a smile. “You hum when you’re thinking too hard. You clench your fists when you’re pissed off. You’re a partner. You’re a mother. And right now, you’re sitting in this chair, holding a beer, trying to figure out how to put these feelings into words. That’s not something a concept does.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s fingers tightened slightly on the bottle. “It doesn’t always feel that way,” she muttered, but her eyes never wavered from Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I know.” Agatha leaned forward, her tone softening further. “But feelings aren’t facts. And whether or not you feel like you’re a person doesn’t change the fact that you </span>
<span class="s2">are</span>
<span class="s1"> one.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a moment, Rio was silent, her expression unreadable. Then she nodded, her gaze dropping briefly to Agatha’s lips before flicking back up. “Okay,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s chest tightened, guilt and love intertwining painfully. “I hate that I ever made you feel otherwise,” she said quietly, her voice trembling just a little. “I’m sorry it took me this long to tell you that.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio opened her mouth to respond, but before she could, a familiar voice crackled through the overhead speaker.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“<em>Good afternoon, ladies and losers. This is your captain speaking. Please fasten your seatbelts, because life comes at you fast, and so do my insults. Complimentary beverages? Not a chance. Emotional baggage? Oh, we’re fully stocked.</em>”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Both Agatha and Rio snapped their heads toward the source of the voice, groaning in unison.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2">Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There was a brief scuffle over the microphone, followed by the sound of static and a muffled “Ow!” before a man’s voice came through, clearing his throat awkwardly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“<em>Uh, sorry about that, folks. Looks like we’ll only have three guests on the tour today- no one else showed up. Anyway, we’ll be heading about an hour and a half offshore, so sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride… or, you know, don’t. Your call.”</em></span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“BOO!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha and Rio practically leapt out of their skin, screaming in perfect harmony. When they spun around, there was Sage, grinning like a lunatic, a beer in hand and zero remorse in her eyes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She raised the bottle as if to toast their terror. “Ah, music to my ears,” she said, taking a long, dramatic sip. She was wearing a fucking captains hat. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">All they could do was blink at Sage, their bewilderment so complete it felt like words had abandoned them entirely, leaving only the faint sound of the ocean and Sage’s smug grin to fill the silence.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage bent down so she could be eye level. “What’s wrong, ladies? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.” She wiggled her eyebrows, clearly reveling in her victory.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s patience snapped. “AAHHHHH!” she yelled, scrambling over her seat like a woman possessed, her hands twitching as if preparing to wrap them around Sage’s neck.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage barely had time to take a step back, her eyes lighting up with amusement. “Whoa, whoa! Easy there, Ma!” she said, though she was clearly enjoying the chaos. Before Agatha could get any further, Rio grabbed her by the waist and yanked her back into her seat.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The word landed like a hammer in Agatha’s chest. Her body went rigid in the chair, Rio’s grip loosening when she noticed the sudden stillness. Agatha stared straight ahead, her knuckles white as they gripped the armrests, her breath caught somewhere in the back of her throat.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The warmth that came with it unsettled her, pressing against the ache she’d lived with for so long that it had almost become comfortable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage was still grinning, completely unaware of the earthquake she’d just set off in Agatha’s chest. And maybe that was for the best. Because for all her cleverness, for all her wit and sarcasm, Sage couldn’t possibly know how deeply that one word had burrowed into Agatha’s heart, unearthing things she wasn’t ready to feel. Things she wasn’t sure she deserved to feel.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Relax, you’re both fine. Though I’m pretty sure I just aged you a decade,” Sage said, smirking as she patted Rio on the shoulder. “Scoot down a chair for me, will you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio moved, her eyes fixed on Agatha, watching her closely. The worry was there, quiet but clear, as if she was waiting for something to break. Sage climbed over the seats with ease and plopped herself right between them, kicking her feet up on the chairs in front of her. “Don’t be so lame. Someone’s got to keep things exciting around here.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Exciting?” Agatha snapped, her voice sharp enough to cut through the tension.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage shrugged, utterly unfazed. “Sure. You scream, I laugh, we all walk away feeling refreshed. Circle of life.” She shot them both a grin that practically sparkled with smugness.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha groaned, dragging her hand down her face, trying to physically wipe away the headache forming behind her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio broke the silence, her tone suspicious. “Weird how we’re the only ones who booked with them for this cruise, no?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage froze, mid sip of her beer, her body stiffening for just a moment. “Hm.” She shrugged, recovering quickly. “Coincidence.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Both Agatha and Rio turned to look at her, brows raised in unison.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage leaned back, folding her arms behind her head. “What? Things happen. Maybe everyone else chickened out.” She grinned again. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha wasn’t buying it. She narrowed her eyes, leaning in just enough to make Sage squirm. “</span>
<span class="s2">Coincidence?</span>
<span class="s1"> That’s your story?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage kept her grin, but the shift in her posture betrayed her. “Yup,” she said, popping the “p” a little too cheerfully. “Total coincidence. You know, random chance, Fate doing her thing. Why question it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio arched an eyebrow. “Right. And the fact that you’ve been grinning like the cat who swallowed the canary since we got on board?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Natural charisma,” Sage shot back at Rio without missing a beat. “You wouldn’t understand.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio smirked back, leaning closer to Sage. “Keep talking like that, and you’ll win a nice swim off the side of this boat.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage leaned back, putting her feet back up on the chairs in front of her, completely unfazed. “Don’t threaten me with a good time,” she said, her smirk widening as she took another sip of her beer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Now tell me </span>
<span class="s2">everything.</span>
<span class="s1"> Start to fucking finish,” Sage demanded. Her beer sloshed slightly as she waved it around for emphasis. “And while you’re at it, humor me with that classic line. You know, one of you says, ‘It’s rotten work,’ and the other goes, ‘Not to me. Not if it’s you.’ Because, as the child of divorced parents, I need this. Give me </span>
<span class="s2">something.</span>
<span class="s1"> Therapy’s expensive.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage pointed aggressively at Agatha with a finger that wasn’t holding her beer. “And don’t skimp on the details, either. I’ve earned this.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha raised an eyebrow, clearly unimpressed. “Earned </span>
<span class="s2">what,</span>
<span class="s1"> exactly?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“This!” Sage gestured between the two of them, her beer threatening to spill again with the wild motion. “This rare, once in a lifetime opportunity to hear the sordid tale of how my divorced, stubborn as hell mothers somehow crawled out of their respective emotional holes and started talking again. Do you know how many kids of divorce </span>
<span class="s2">dream</span>
<span class="s1"> of this moment? I’m living the fantasy right now. So spill.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio groaned, resting her head in her hand. “You act like we owe you a Netflix special or something.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“If the shoe fits.” Sage took a smug sip of her beer, clearly enjoying every second of their misery. “Come on, don’t leave me hanging. </span>
<span class="s2">Rotten work, not to me.</span>
<span class="s1"> Let’s hear it!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tilted her head, her lips curling into a sly smile. “You know what? You’re right, Sage. We </span>
<span class="s2">do</span>
<span class="s1"> owe you a lot. In fact, I’ve been meaning to tell you something.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage froze, her smirk faltering slightly. “What’s that?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s expression softened just enough to make Sage lean in, suddenly unsure. “Well,” Agatha said casually, glancing at Rio, “you’re going to be a big sister.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage blinked, her brain clearly short-circuiting as the words registered. “Wait… what?!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s head whipped toward Agatha, her eyes wide with shock. “What?!”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh, didn’t I tell you?” Agatha said, feigning innocence as she leaned back in her seat. “I’m pregnant. Surprise.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage nearly dropped her beer, staring at Agatha like she’d just grown a second head. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shot up out of her chair, stumbling into the aisle. She bent over, hands on her knees, gasping dramatically. “I need a throw up bag! Someone hand me a fucking throw up bag!” she wheezed, her voice shaky.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“At </span>
<span class="s2">your</span>
<span class="s1"> age?” Sage said, staring at Agatha like she’d just announced she was moving to Mars.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“How dare you</span>
<span class="s1">,” Agatha snapped, sitting up straighter and glaring at Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio, who was still standing in the aisle, bent over with her hands on her knees. “Seriously someone needs to tell me this is a joke before I pass out,” she muttered, her voice strained.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh, relax. You’re not going to pass out, Rio.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shot her a sharp glare. “I might, depending on the answer.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s eyes darted between the two of them, still trying to process everything. “Wait, so… are you serious or not? Because if you are, I need time to emotionally prepare for this nightmare.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let the silence hang for another moment before finally rolling her eyes. “Oh, fine. I’m joking. Happy?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio let out a loud groan, dropping into her seat with dramatic exhaustion.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Why the fuck would you joke about that?” Sage asked, her voice rising as she gestured wildly with her beer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha crossed her arms and leaned toward her, a smirk tugging at the corners of her lips. “Because you piss me off, and you deserved a taste of your own medicine.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The same man from earlier came over the speakers, “<em>Alright, ladies, we’re coming to a slow stop. Some of our crew spotted whales, so feel free to head up to the front deck whenever you’d like.</em>”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage was on her feet before the announcement even ended, abandoning her beer in her haste. She tried to climb over Rio’s lap, but one of her legs caught awkwardly, throwing her off balance. Her sailor hat flew off as she tripped, nearly face planting before catching herself on the floor with her hands.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio stared at her, unimpressed, as Sage scrambled to untangle her leg, muttering under her breath. She grabbed her hat from the floor, jammed it back on her head, and stormed down the aisle like she hadn’t just made a complete fool of herself. Without a pause, she shoved open the doors to the front deck and disappeared outside.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Are you okay?” Rio asked, still seated, her eyes scanning Agatha’s face carefully.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“She raises my blood pressure more than you ever did, and that’s saying something,” Agatha muttered, brushing a hand through her hair. “Also, I think </span>
<span class="s2">I</span>
<span class="s1"> should be asking </span>
<span class="s2">you</span>
<span class="s1"> that question.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I’m better,” Rio said, shifting uncomfortably in her seat as if trying to convince herself as much as Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hummed, the sound low and unconvinced, as she stood up. Rio followed suit, stepping into the aisle to block her path, arms casually folded across her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What?” Agatha asked, tilting her head. “Still queasy from the idea of another kid?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You noticed that, did you?” Rio replied, her tone feigning nonchalance, but her eyes betrayed her embarrassment.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Noticed?” Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Rio, you were yelling for an emesis bag like we were in a hospital drama.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s lips twitched as if she wanted to deny it, but instead, she let out a soft groan. “So? We don’t need another kid.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No, we fucking don’t,” Agatha agreed, stepping closer, her arms crossed. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio glanced to the side, a slow grin forming as she looked back at Agatha. “I mean, if you </span>
<span class="s2">did</span>
<span class="s1"> want one, I’m sure I could work my magic.” Her grin widened as she wiggled her eyebrows and thrust her hips playfully bumping into Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha raised an unimpressed eyebrow but couldn’t entirely fight the smirk tugging at her lips. “Oh, </span>
<span class="s2">magic</span>
<span class="s1">, huh? Is that what you call it? Because I distinctly remember your so called magic almost sending you into cardiac arrest five minutes ago.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio chuckled, leaning in closer, her voice dropping to a playful whisper. “Yeah, but you gotta admit… it’s good magic. </span>
<span class="s2">Memorable</span>
<span class="s1"> magic.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sighed dramatically, stepping around her with a flick of her hair. “Save it, Romeo. One Sage is enough chaos for a lifetime.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Wait,” Rio said, catching Agatha by the wrist and pulling her back with just enough force to make her pause. Before Agatha could ask what was going on, Rio closed the gap between them, her lips meeting Agatha’s in a kiss that was anything but subtle. It was open, consuming, and unrelenting, as though Rio had been waiting for this moment all day and maybe she had.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio finally pulled back, her hand lingered on Agatha’s wrist, her thumb brushing against her skin. Her eyes stayed on Agatha’s lips, heavy lidded and full of intent, as if she was debating whether one kiss was enough.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stood frozen, her breath coming in shallow bursts as she tried to find her voice. “What… what was that for?” she asked, her words unsteady but sharp.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shrugged, her lips curving into a sly smile, the kind that always infuriated Agatha just as much as it drew her in. “I’ve been starved all day,” she murmured, her tone casual, almost lazy. But there was something behind her words- a warmth, a playful edge- that made it clear. She didn’t need a reason. Rio just wanted to kiss her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s brow arched, trying to focus on something other than the way her heart was hammering in her chest. “Starved, huh?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s smirk widened, her thumb still brushing softly over Agatha’s wrist. “Mmhmm. Completely deprived. Torturous, really.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha rolled her eyes, but her lips twitched with the hint of a smile. Without a word, she slid her hand into Rio’s, her fingers threading through Rio’s. “Let’s go watch the fucking whales,” she muttered. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Rio could respond, Agatha tugged her forward, dragging her out the door. Rio stumbled slightly, caught off guard, before falling in step behind her, her grin widening as she let herself be pulled along.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When they stepped through the door, Sage was smashed up against the railing, her hands gripping it tightly as if holding on for dear life. She leaned forward, practically vibrating with excitement, her knuckles white from how hard she was clutching the metal. She whipped her head back toward them, her grin so blindingly bright that Agatha had to squint.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Look!” Sage shouted, her voice bursting with excitement, pointing wildly toward the water.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let go of Rio’s hand, her attention immediately drawn to the ocean. She made her way to the railing, stopping just a slight distance from Sage, not for the view of the water but to get a better look at Sage’s reaction.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio followed closely behind, her steps slower, her gaze drifting between Agatha and the horizon.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When they looked out, they saw them- two whales gliding through the water, a mother and her calf. The baby breached the surface dramatically, twisting its small body as water sprayed into the air. It didn’t break much height but landed with an enthusiastic splash that sent ripples across the waves.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s lips twitched into a faint smile as her gaze flicked between the whales and Sage’s glowing face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio settled beside her, leaning her elbows on the railing, her eyes on the whales as the baby breached again, twisting before splashing down. “Not bad,” Rio murmured, the faintest trace of a smile playing on her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Just as the words left Rio’s mouth, the water a little ways off the side of the boat began to shift. The ocean seemed to ripple with intent, as if something massive stirred beneath the surface. Then, with a force that felt almost deliberate, an enormous blue whale breached the water. Its immense body rose impossibly high, water streaming from its skin like silver threads caught in the sunlight. For a moment, it hung there, suspended in time, as though the ocean itself had offered it to the sky.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The splash was thunderous, sending waves rippling toward the boat in perfect, rhythmic pulses. The air felt charged, thick with something that clung to the skin, something ancient and untamed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Holy shit,” Rio whispered, her voice hushed, her eyes locked on the water where the whale had disappeared. She was standing straight now, her posture rigid. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s eyes lingered on the water for a moment, before flicking to Sage. She stood at the railing, her hands gripping it tightly, her knuckles pale. There was something in her stance that made Agatha’s chest tighten.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage turned to Rio, her expression raw, wide open in a way Agatha rarely saw. Her voice came softly but with a weight that made it feel like a declaration. “Do you feel it? Her power?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze snapped to Rio, whose eyes were fixed on the waves as if they held all the answers. Rio’s chest rose and fell unevenly, her breath catching as though she’d been struck by something she couldn’t fully name.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Yeah,” Rio murmured, her voice low. “I feel it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s gaze shifted between them. Rio, still as the waves seemed to move in time with her, and Sage, her fingers gripping the railing like she was tethering herself to something unseen. The energy pulsing through the ocean wasn’t just random, wasn’t just nature- it felt purposeful, alive, like it was responding to something more.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And it wasn’t just Rio. The faintest ripple of that same connection lingered around Sage, subtle but undeniable, as if the ocean recognized her, too. The way the waves moved, the way the air felt charged- it all seemed to stem from them both, a force that felt vast and immeasurable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha couldn’t explain it, couldn’t feel it herself, but she could </span>
<span class="s2">see</span>
<span class="s1"> it in the way the ocean answered their presence, bending and flowing like it was alive, like it </span>
<span class="s2">knew</span>
<span class="s1"> them. And in that moment, it felt like the sea wasn’t just moving- it was </span>
<span class="s2">listening</span>
<span class="s1">.</span>

<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The rest of their time whale watching had been calm, almost serene. After the extraordinary moment of the whale breaching, there had been no more surprises just waves and the gentle grace of the whales moving through the water. It was a quieter kind of beauty, but it didn’t diminish Sage’s wonder in the slightest. She had soaked up every second, her enthusiasm shining as she pointed out every flick of a tail or rise of a spout on the horizon. Sage had been glowing, her joy was infectious. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha, however, had barely paid attention to the whales. Her focus had been on Sage, on Rio, on the way they both fit into this moment so naturally. Sage would glance back at her and Rio every now and then, her face lit with wide, toothy smiles so full of love and excitement it almost hurt to look at. And every time, Agatha’s heart soared, leaving her feeling like the softest, mushiest fool imaginable. Sage’s joy wasn’t just something to witness- it was something Agatha felt in her own chest, like the echoes of a song she thought she’d forgotten.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This was more than just a day at the ocean. Agatha knew that as surely as she knew her own name. This was a milestone, one of those precious moments that etched itself into a person’s memory forever. It reminded her of what she had lost for so long - the chance to be present for these moments, not just as a someone observing from afar, but as a mother, a part of something whole.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha had only seen parts of Sage’s life through her memories, and even her time spent in Rio’s realm had felt like looking through a window, close enough to see but never close enough to touch. Yet now, she was no longer on the outside. She was here, truly present, witnessing it all unfold from start to finish. There was no running, no chaos, no grief clawing at her insides. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let herself smile, soft and unguarded, because holding it back felt impossible. When her eyes drifted to Rio, she found herself stunned by what she saw. Rio wasn’t watching the whales, either. Her gaze was fixed on Agatha, warm and unyielding, her brown eyes filled with so much love that it made Agatha’s breath catch. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was almost too much… Rio looking at her like that… Soft… Devoted... Like she’d carved this moment out of time just for them. Agatha wouldn’t have been surprised if Rio started sprouting flowers, given the way her love seemed to bloom right there in front of her. It was beautiful, achingly so, and it hit Agatha with an intensity she hadn’t expected.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This moment was something Agatha never thought she would have again. She had spent lifetimes believing joy like this was lost to her. But here it was, as real as the sun glinting off the water or the sound of Sage’s laughter carried by the breeze. It wasn’t perfect. Agatha’s heart still ached for Nicky, but the ache didn’t swallow her whole. Instead, it lived quietly beside the happiness, a bittersweet reminder of what she had endured and what she still had. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Love did not erase the past, but it made room for the future. And as Agatha looked at Rio, who held her gaze like she was the most precious thing in the world, and Sage, whose joy literally lit up the very air around them, she let herself believe. Believe in the possibility of healing, of living, of being whole again. Not despite the pain, but alongside it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s words from one of their earliest exchanges of literature rang in her ears:</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">‘</span> <span class="s2"><em>It doesn’t devour. It transforms. Erosion isn’t just loss. It’s change. The sea reshapes everything it touches</em>.’</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2"><em>Fuck</em>.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Turns out, Sage had been annoyingly right.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The drive back to the beach house was quiet, but it carried a sense of peace rather than awkwardness. The air was filled with the lingering warmth of shared joy, a silence that felt natural. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When they returned to the house that afternoon, Sage announced she was going to take a nap. Once she disappeared into her room downstairs, Rio turned to Agatha with a soft smile and simply asked, “Beach date?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Who the hell was Agatha to refuse her?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">After changing into their swimsuits, Agatha followed Rio out onto the beach. Rio had a small cooler slung over her shoulder. They didn’t head to the familiar lounge chairs they had occupied the day before, though. Instead, Rio led them further down the beach. Agatha didn’t ask where they were going. She simply followed, their shared silence feeling as warm and soothing as the sun on her skin. The beach houses in the neighborhood spaced far apart. There were no loud children, no bustling families, nothing to disturb the serenity. It was just the two of them and the soft sound of the waves.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They walked for a while, though Agatha couldn’t have said for how long. It might have been fifteen minutes or an hour; she had no sense of time, her mind blissfully quiet. For the first time in what felt like forever, she was content. Her thoughts didn’t pull her back into the past or lurch forward into uncertainties. Agatha was simply here, in this moment, and it was enough.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The further they walked, the more secluded the beach became. The sand stretched endlessly ahead, untouched with signs of houses or anything man made. The air was filled with the soft sounds of waves rolling onto the shore and the occasional distant call of seagulls. On one side, the water moved in its gentle rhythm, and on the other, tall clusters of beach grass lined the edge of the sand, shifting lightly in the breeze. The world felt quiet and still, as if it belonged entirely to them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha had been watching her feet move through the shallow tide, the cool water swirling around her ankles, when she realized Rio had stopped. She glanced up, and what she saw brought her to a halt.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Nestled on the sand was a daybed beneath a rustic cabana, its weathered wooden frame blending perfectly with the beach. Wooden beams stretched across the top, with white fabric woven loosely between them, creating a shaded canopy that let the sunlight peek through. The daybed, with its L-shaped backrest, formed a cozy corner while leaving the foot and one side open to the ocean. Plush cushions and pillows in soft whites, light greens, and earthy browns covered the bed, with a woven throw draped over one corner. It was simple yet impossibly inviting, a perfect haven in the middle of the untouched beach.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha turned to Rio, her chest tightening as she took it all in. Rio stood a few steps ahead, watching her with a soft, knowing smile. It was such a Rio thing to do, unspoken yet deeply thoughtful, creating something so serene and beautiful without fuss. Agatha couldn’t help but smile back. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio motioned toward the daybed with a tilt of her head, and Agatha stepped forward, her feet carrying her across the soft sand. She followed Rio, her curiosity growing with each step, though she said nothing. All she could focus on was Rio’s easy stride as she led the way.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Maybe her eyes lingered on Rio’s ass a little longer than necessary, but that was beside the point. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When they reached the daybed, Agatha watched as Rio settled comfortably in the middle. With practiced ease, she placed the cooler on the wide, sturdy edge of the backrest where the L-shape joined, tucking it neatly into the corner. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stood at the foot of the daybed, her arms loosely crossed over her chest. Her thumb brushed absently over the ring on her finger, hidden beneath her arm, as she gazed at Rio with a small, lopsided smile she couldn’t quite keep off her face. “Did you do this, or did it come with the beach?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had only pursed her lips, fighting back a smile, and shrugged with nonchalance.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She hadn’t needed to ask. Agatha already knew the answer. Death had always been a romantic, and her love had always been the kind that left an impression. But this felt different. Different from anything they had ever done before.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Don’t get her wrong; Before Nicky, their love had been wild and untamed, full of passion that burned brightly and was fueled by wicked chaos. They were reckless together, their connection a force that consumed everything in its path. Rio had always loved Agatha in a way that was intense and unpredictable, dramatic in ways only Rio could be.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha still remembered the time Rio had brought her a bouquet of white roses, their petals streaked with blood. <em>“For you,</em>” Rio had said so casually, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Agatha had stared, stunned, as Rio added, “<em>He won’t bother you again</em>,” her signature smirk tugging at her lips. It was horrifying, it was dramatic, and it was so utterly Rio that Agatha hadn’t been able to do anything but laugh.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Their marriage had been for love, but it had also been urgent, as though they were holding on to something that could slip away. Life and Death, bound together, always teetering between beauty and destruction.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But this… this was different. This love wasn’t chaos or desperation. It didn’t feel fragile, like something they needed to protect. It was steady, deep, and unshakable, like the ocean stretching endlessly before them. It was so profound it filled every corner of Agatha’s soul<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>in a way she hadn’t thought possible. Agatha wasn’t fighting it anymore. She didn’t want to.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">As she stepped closer to the bed, joining Rio in this emotionally intimate moment, Agatha felt peace settle over her. It was not a still peace, but one alive with energy. It didn’t erase the storms inside her; it gave them meaning.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For all her talk of quieting the chaos, this love was its own kind of tempest- enormous and consuming, but no longer something to fear. It didn’t destroy. It remade. And Agatha let herself surrender to it completely.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha would dance with Death for as long as her feet could carry her, and this time, her rhythm would not falter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha settled onto the daybed to Rio’s left, leaning back against the sturdy frame as she gazed out at the ocean. The view was soothing, but her focus kept drifting to Rio beside her. Rio waited until Agatha seemed comfortable before reaching for the two Dos Equis beers and a pair of bottle koozies. The koozies, with built in bottle cap openers attached to the zippers, dangled loosely in Rio’s grip as she shifted closer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio turned her body toward Agatha, her legs slightly bent as she rested her side against the backrest. Her knees brushed softly against Agatha’s, close enough to feel her warmth but never overstep. The space between them was small, so close that it would take only the slightest movement to close the gap entirely.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio set the unopened beers against her thighs and held out the koozies, her brown eyes filled with mischief. “Which one do you want?” she asked, her tone teasing.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">One koozie was baby pink with bold white letters that read, ‘Wet and ready… for a refill.’ The other was rainbow striped and announced proudly, ‘Queer and here for the beer.’</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha rolled her eyes and smirked, fighting the urge to laugh. Without a word, she snatched the rainbow one from Rio’s hand and turned her attention back to the ocean, trying to hide the amusement tugging at her lips. They slipped the koozies onto their bottles, popped the caps off with the attached openers, and Rio casually tossed the caps into the open cooler.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Rio turned back to Agatha, her beer was in her left hand, resting lightly on the wide wooden edge of the backrest behind her. Her arm wasn’t draped over Agatha’s shoulders but rested just below them, brushing against the middle of her shoulder blades. Her right hand idly played with the tassels of a pillow.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha, on the other hand, gripped her beer loosely in her lap, her thumbs twiddling against each other as if she didn’t know what else to do with them. A strange nervousness settled over her, like she was a teenager on a first date instead of someone who had confidently slid a ring onto Rio’s finger in a jealous rage that very morning. It was ridiculous, really. She’d faced Death- hell, she’d married her even- and now she was flustered over sitting on a daybed? </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">Bizarre. Completely, utterly bizarre.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could feel the restless energy buzzing under her skin, a yearning that she couldn’t quite pin down. She wanted everything with Rio. This was all so ridiculously romantic, the kind that made her chest ache with its perfection. She wanted to pull Rio closer, to strip away that barely-there bikini and lose herself completely in her. Agatha wanted Rio to touch her, to tear her apart, to leave her utterly breathless and undone.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But at the same time, she wanted to talk. About what, she had no idea, but the urge to sit and ramble with Rio about nothing and everything had been clawing at her all day. Sure, they’d talked. They’d flirted, teased, and Agatha had even acted on jealousy earlier, letting it slip into her words and actions in ways she didn’t bother to hide. They’d had a nice conversation, but all in short bursts, fleeting moments that only made her want more. Agatha was addicted, and now the lack of it felt like withdrawals. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She had stopped caring about what people had to say a long time ago. Words had always seemed tedious, meaningless, and </span>now, Agatha found herself wanting to listen. Not just wanting, but craving it. She was all too willing to soak up anything Rio would share, every little thought, every ridiculous observation.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">It was fucking weird.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">This was different from those first few weeks in Rio’s realm, when Agatha’s craving had been born out of desperation, a need fueled by the unfamiliar sting of being denied. Rio had never told her no, not once, not even when it came to Nicky.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It hit her now, quietly and without warning, that maybe Nicky’s soul had made the choice to slip away in the night. Maybe he had known it would be easier than staying, easier than watching her spiral and fight tooth and nail to hold onto him. He had been tired... Agatha could feel that now. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The thought didn’t crush her, didn’t steal every ounce of air from her lungs. It only ached like a scar that still really fucking stung but no longer bled.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">And we’re back from the heartache commercial break, folks, with another thrilling episode of ‘Rio: The Fine Print in Agatha’s Hard-Won Existence.’</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha wanted to dive headfirst into Rio’s mind and explore every hidden corner of her psyche. She needed to rediscover everything she had ever known about her, uncover what she might have missed, and learn things she never even knew existed. The ache for understanding gnawed at her, restless and relentless.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She brought her thumb to her mouth, teeth worrying. Turning her head slightly, she tried to angle Rio out of her peripheral vision, as if avoiding her could settle the restless energy coursing through her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Everything stilled the moment Rio’s hand gently wrapped around Agatha’s. The touch was a complete contrast to the emotional earthquake in Agatha’s chest. Rio eased her hand away from her mouth unhurried and certain. Agatha turned toward her, caught off guard by the way Rio was already watching her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a beat, neither of them moved. Agatha’s lips hovered slightly parted, words forgotten. The silence between them spoke louder than anything else, pulling Agatha deeper into the moment Rio had quietly commanded without a word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio brought Agatha’s hand down to rest on her thigh. There was no ulterior motive, no hidden intention. It was a gesture that was offering a sense of stability.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The touch carried a simplicity that needed no explanation, a way of saying without words, </span> <span class="s2">I’m right here.</span> <span class="s1"> It wasn’t about making a statement or proving a point; it was simply Rio’s way of holding her there, keeping her present in the moment.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha glanced down at their joined hands, her fingers twitching slightly before settling.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I feel…” Rio tilted her head, her gaze searching for Agatha’s. “Like you should take a breath before you combust.” Her voice was gentle, laced with quiet amusement. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And Agatha did. She took a breath. She cast a fleeting look at the ocean before turning back to Rio, who still had a small smile playing at her lips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha gave Rio’s thigh a gentle squeeze before retreating, her fingers lingering for just a second longer than necessary. Turning her gaze toward the ocean, she lifted her beer to her lips, taking a slow sip. Then, with a side glance at Rio, she murmured, “You’re really fucking romantic, you know that?” Her voice was low, almost begrudging, but she meant every single word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio bellowed a laugh, the sound full and unrestrained. “Only for you.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha grunted in response, taking another swig.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s eyes flicked toward her hand, her head tilting slightly. “Why do you always hold your beer like that?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha frowned, lowering the bottle just enough to look at her. “Like what?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“By the neck,” Rio said, gesturing vaguely. “With your whole fist wrapped around it. It’s unsettling.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stared at her, then down at her own hand like she was just now noticing how she had been holding it. She flexed her fingers but didn’t adjust her grip. “How else am I supposed to hold it?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Like a </span> <span class="s2">normal</span> <span class="s1"> person,” Rio said, still eyeing her with mild concern.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha scoffed, taking another sip. “This </span> <span class="s2">is</span> <span class="s1"> normal.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio shook her head. “No, it’s </span> <span class="s2">aggressive.</span> <span class="s1"> You’re holding that bottle like it personally wronged you.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smirked, shrugging. “Maybe it did.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio sighed, reaching out and wrapping her fingers around Agatha’s hand, attempting to pry it from the bottle. “You’re making me nervous. At least pretend you’re drinking it and not preparing to strangle it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let Rio reposition her grip, watching with mild amusement as Rio guided her fingers into something more relaxed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“There,” Rio said, satisfied.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha raised an eyebrow, lifting the beer to her lips in the new grip, then promptly shifted it back to how she had been holding it before.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio rolled her eyes but didn’t argue, letting the silence settle between them. Agatha felt it then, the absentminded way Rio’s fingers, the ones resting behind her on the ledge of the backrest, began tracing soft, lazy circles along the outside of her upper arm. It was light, barely there, like Rio wasn’t even fully aware she was doing it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha exhaled, her gaze drifting back to the ocean. The waves rolled in steady, the hush of water meeting sand wrapping around them like a gentle embrace. It was peaceful, the kind of quiet that settled deep into her bones. She sighed, the last traces of tension unraveling under the warmth of Rio’s touch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio followed her gaze and hummed. “The ocean seems restless today.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha furrowed her brow. “It doesn’t look restless to me.” Her voice was soft as she turned her head slightly toward Rio, who was still watching the waves. For a moment, Agatha almost startled. They were close, so close that Agatha could feel the slow rise of Rio’s breath between them, and Rio looked so fucking stunning. This entire day, this surprise, this quiet, stolen moment- it was all so devastatingly romantic.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She didn’t think. She just leaned in, pressing a kiss just below Rio’s ear, where her jaw met her neck. It was soft, lingering, with no purpose beyond simply wanting to.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When she pulled back, Rio turned her head. A confused smile played at her lips, her brow furrowing just enough that Agatha thought she might ask what that was for. But instead, Rio’s breath hitched slightly, and she whispered, “Uh-” like the tenderness had caught her completely off guard. “Um. It’s not about how it looks. It’s about how it feels.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh.” That was all Agatha managed, her chest suddenly full with something deep and warm and weightless. She had spent lifetimes guarding herself against softness like this, yet here she was, drowning in it, wanting nothing more than to stay in this moment forever.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For once, Agatha didn’t want to push or pull. She didn’t want to challenge or provoke. She just wanted to listen. She wanted to hear Rio talk, about everything and nothing, about things she had known and things she had never thought to ask.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You should tell me about that,” Agatha said, her voice quieter now. “Your connection with the ocean, I mean. I know your magic is tied to the earth, but I never thought about it like that.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“The ocean has always felt… close,” Rio murmured. “Like it knows me in a way nothing else does. It doesn’t scare me, but it’s not comforting either. It’s just… there.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha studied her, brow furrowing. “What does that mean?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“It means I don’t understand it any more than you do.” Rio’s voice was quiet, thoughtful. “I don’t control it, not really. It just… listens.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha considered that, rolling the words over in her mind. “That makes sense.“ </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio smiled at her, saying nothing at first, but the way she poked her tongue into her cheek made Agatha’s stomach drop. Agatha knew that look. She didn’t know where this was going, but she knew it had nothing to do with what they had just been talking about.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” she muttered, rolling her eyes. She was already bracing herself for whatever nonsense was about to come out of Rio’s mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“So…” Rio dragged out the word, wiggling her eyebrows twice before pressing her tongue into her cheek again. “Want to talk about this morning?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha exhaled sharply.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You mean </span> <span class="s2">you</span> <span class="s1"> defacing a book from a small business?” She knew </span> <span class="s2">exactly</span> <span class="s1"> what Rio was talking about. She just wasn’t about to make it easy. As if to prove her point, she absentmindedly spun the ring on her finger, feigning indifference.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio made a loud, obnoxious </span> <span class="s2">wrong answer</span> <span class="s1"> buzzer noise, shaking her head. “Great guess, but try again.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha gasped dramatically, eyes widening in mock excitement. “Ooo, ooo! I </span> <span class="s2">know</span> <span class="s1"> this one.” She clasped her hands together, voice brimming with exaggerated enthusiasm. “You and Sage seeing who could pickpocket the most expensive thing during the </span> <span class="s2">ten minute</span> <span class="s1"> walk back to the car?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio grinned. “Oh, you </span> <span class="s2">are</span> <span class="s1"> fun when you try.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1">Now </span> <span class="s2">that</span> <span class="s1"> had been entertaining- for multiple reasons.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">1. Agatha </span> <span class="s2">fucking</span> <span class="s1"> loved petty crime, especially when its victims were arrogant pricks who deserved it. Bonus points if it kept overly friendly people away from her wife. (She </span> <span class="s2">still</span> <span class="s1"> wanted to strangle that bookstore employee.)</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">2. Watching Rio partake in petty crime? </span> <span class="s2"><em>Hot</em>.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">3. Watching </span> <span class="s2">Sage</span> <span class="s1"> execute it </span> <span class="s2">flawlessly</span> <span class="s1">? <em>Heaven</em>.</span></p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">4. Agatha loved watching them compete- whether it was chess, cards, or skipping rocks. Sage </span> <span class="s2">always</span> <span class="s1">won, but Rio? Rio gave her a fight every time. It was hilarious, considering Rio had taught Sage everything she knew. She’d basically raised a version of herself that even </span> <span class="s2">Lady Death</span> <span class="s1"> could not outmatch.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio was </span> <span class="s2">brilliant,</span> <span class="s1"> but Sage was something else entirely. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Case in point: Earlier that morning, Agatha had watched Sage pull off the smoothest lift she’d ever seen. Some rich asshole knocked into her without a second glance, and Sage, arms outstretched in fake outrage, called after him- only to turn around with a </span> <span class="s2">very</span> <span class="s1"> expensive diamond rimmed watch dangling from her fingers, grinning like the absolute menace she was.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha’s </span> <span class="s2">heart soared.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And then Rio outdid her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">In one seamless motion, she lifted something from a distracted café patron- an </span> <span class="s2">insanely</span> <span class="s1"> expensive Cartier bracelet.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">Rio had won. <em>Hot</em>. </p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Or so she </span> <span class="s2">thought.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Back at the beach house, Agatha asked Sage for her wallet so she could stash it in her purse. Sage handed it over and went to nap without a second thought.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Except… it wasn’t her usual wallet.</span>
</p><p class="p3"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was a Ralph Lauren men’s alligator </span>
<span class="s1">wallet, stuffed with Sage’s money and cards like she hadn’t just swapped it out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha threw a look at Rio, who stepped in, eyeing it before exhaling sharply.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“<em>Oh, that little shit…”</em></span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio hadn’t won after all.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I’ll set the scene!” Rio announced, pulling Agatha from her thoughts. Rio took a sip of her beer, as if preparing for a grand performance. “There I was, minding my own business in a bookstore-“</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Lie,” Agatha cut in.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“-when my ex-wife, Agatha Harkness, had an absolute meltdown-”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Not a meltdown.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“-stormed out of said bookstore, then stormed right back in and put this-” Rio lifted her left hand, beer still in her grasp, and wiggled her fingers between them, drawing attention to the ring. “-on my finger.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha rolled her eyes. “You didn’t seem to mind so much after the fact, if I’m remembering correctly.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio smirked, “Hey! I was distracted by how inexplicably attractive you are when you’re jealous.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha gave her a pointed look. “Get to the point, Rio.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“What if I wanted you to ask me… properly?” Rio’s tone was still playful, but there was something else beneath it, something just a little more serious. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re kidding.” Agatha stared at her, searching for the glint of mischief in Rio’s eyes that was there not moments ago.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Maybe I’m not.” The playfulness in Rio’s voice had thinned, replaced by something quieter.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a breathless laugh, shaking her head. Rio had to be fooling herself if she thought Agatha was about to drop to one knee and propose like this was some grand romantic gesture. She opened her mouth to say as much, “Rio, you’re-“</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Am I your wife again?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The question cut through the air. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stilled.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio held her gaze, but there was something fragile in the way she did, like she was bracing for impact. Hope flickered in her eyes, but beneath it lay something heavier, something </span> <span class="s2">tired</span> <span class="s1"> like she was already preparing herself for Agatha to dismiss it, to say it had been impulsive, meaningless, a moment of weakness.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s chest tightened. <em>How could Rio think that?</em></span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It hadn’t even crossed her mind that Rio might not have </span> <span class="s2">known</span> <span class="s1">.. that she might have questioned whether Agatha truly meant it. But of course Agatha had. </span> <span class="s2">Of course</span> <span class="s1"> she had. Rio was her wife. Rio had always been her wife. And Agatha wanted the whole damn world to know it.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">More than that, she needed </span> <span class="s2">Rio</span> <span class="s1"> to know it.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Of course you’re my wife,” Agatha said, the words slipping out almost breathless, like the very thought of Rio believing otherwise had knocked the air from her lungs.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio didn’t hesitate, “Then humor me.” </span>Her voice was quieter now, but it carried weight. She gave the smallest nod toward her left hand, resting between them. The look in her eyes wasn’t playful anymore. It was a plea, quiet but unmistakable.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha fucking melted. But she huffed, straightened her shoulders, and reached back to set her beer down on the ledge. Without a word, she turned, plucked Rio’s from her grasp, and did the same.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, she took Rio’s hand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">With careful precision, she slid the ring from Rio’s finger, holding it between her fingers as she studied it. The gold band, etched with ivy leaves, felt warm in her palm. A small black stone sat encrusted in the center. It was </span> <span class="s2">so</span> <span class="s1"> undeniably Rio. Agatha almost smirked, silently acknowledging that, even in a fit of jealous rage, she had known exactly what belonged on Rio’s hand.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When she finally looked up, Rio was watching her. Lips caught between her teeth, gaze flicking away for half a second before locking back onto Agatha’s. Blue meeting brown, completely unwavering.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha still had Rio’s hand in hers, the weight of the ring pressing into her palm. Slowly, deliberately, she ran her thumb over the length of Rio’s ring finger, feeling the absence where the band had rested.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She didn’t look away when she spoke.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2">“Marry me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn’t a question. It wasn’t a request. There was no hesitation, no plea for reassurance. Just a simple, undeniable truth, spoken aloud. </span>As if it had only ever been a matter of time.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words settled between them, heavy but certain, like they had been waiting for Agatha to say them. There was no grand speech, no overcomplicated reasoning. Just the truth- blunt, absolute, and far too late to take back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s2">“I’m not asking.”</span> <span class="s1"> Agatha’s voice was quiet, but firm. Unshakable. “I’m telling you. This time, I mean it.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She turned Rio’s hand in hers, pressing the ring against Rio’s palm for a moment and turned her hand back over. Carefully, Agatha began to slide it back onto Rio’s finger. </span> <span class="s2">Intentionally.</span> <span class="s1"> Like sealing something in place, something that had never really been undone, no matter how many lifetimes, how much distance, how many times they had burned and rebuilt themselves from the ruin of each other.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha’s fingers lingered once the ring was back where it belonged, her thumb brushing against it as if </span> <span class="s2">cementing</span> <span class="s1"> the moment.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now, for the first time, Agatha was saying it </span> <span class="s2">without</span> <span class="s1"> fear. Without conditions. Without a way out.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And she </span> <span class="s2">dared</span> <span class="s1"> Rio to doubt her.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was looking at Agatha like she had created the world just for her, like Agatha had pulled the stars from the sky and set them at Rio’s feet. Her breath was shaky, lips parted, eyes dark with something completely naked and undone.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s2">“Kiss me,”</span> <span class="s1"> Rio all but whimpered, the words barely escaping before they could get swallowed.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha did not fucking hesitate.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s hand was already moving, fingers curling against Agatha’s cheek, pulling her in like she couldn’t stand even a sliver of space between them. Agatha’s hands found Rio’s waist drawing her closer, pressing their bodies together until there was nothing left between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And then their lips met.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The moment they did, the waves crashed against the shore with a sudden, resounding force, the tide surging forward as if the ocean itself had been holding its breath. The sound thundered through the air, </span> <span class="s3">not summoned, but answering.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because it wasn’t just the sea. It was </span> <span class="s3">Rio.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She did not command it. She never had. ‘</span> <em> <span class="s2">I don’t control it, not really, It just listens.’</span> </em></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And it was listening now.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The water pulled forward, waves rolling harder against the sand as if mirroring the way Rio’s fingers tangled into Agatha’s hair, the way her lips parted, breath hitching as Agatha deepened the kiss. The ocean did not wait; it surged, responding to what pulsed beneath Rio’s skin, to something finally breaking free.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Another wave crashed, a deep, repeating pull, </span> <span class="s3">not violent, but insistent</span> <span class="s1">, like it refused to be ignored. The tide stretched farther up the shore, creeping toward the daybed, a slow, hungry reach that mirrored the way Rio’s hands slid to Agatha’s back, gripping, anchoring.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha felt Rio exhale against her, a sound that was almost a sigh, almost a plea, and the ocean responded again, the next wave rolling in deeper, pushing past where the last had settled. It was as if the sea itself was trying to reach them, </span> <span class="s3">to pull them closer.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio whimpered into her mouth, fingers curling in Agatha’s bathing suit top, holding on like she was afraid to let go. And the water swelled in kind, </span> <span class="s3">rising and dragging, stretching itself thin, caught in the same pull that Rio was.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Agatha wasn’t leaving. Not this time.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha poured that truth into the kiss, into the way her hand slid up Rio’s spine, into the way she held her close, grounding them both.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio melted beneath her, soft and desperate in a way Agatha had never felt or seen before.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And the ocean?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It stilled.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The waves that had been crashing, desperate and reaching, settled into something slower, something deeper. No longer surging, no longer clawing at the shore.. just </span> <span class="s3">pulling, rocking, waiting.</span> <span class="s1"> The tide eased into a steady rhythm, </span> <span class="s3">not calmed, but content.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s forehead rested against hers, her breath warm between them, lips still parted, waiting.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha pressed one last kiss to the corner of her mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s2">“Still listening?”</span> <span class="s1"> Agatha murmured.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">She wasn’t just talking about the ocean. They both knew that.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The waves had followed every breath, every shift, every hesitation. They had roared with the force of Rio’s longing and settled only when she had finally let herself give in. But this had never been about control. It had never been about power.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The ocean had simply listened.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And now, </span> <span class="s3">so was Rio.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio swallowed, her fingers tightening where they rested against Agatha’s bathing suit top. </span>“Always.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And beyond them, the ocean answered with a final, quiet hush as the waves smoothed into a slow, unbroken lull- settling, resting, at peace.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s2">“Come here.” </span>Agatha pulled away just enough to breathe the words, her voice softer now, no urgency, just certainty. She leaned back against the cushioned daybed, settling in as she spread her legs, patting the space between them. An invitation.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio hesitated only for a second before shifting, adjusting herself between Agatha’s thighs. But just before she leaned back, she turned, looking over her shoulder at Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br/></span>“I love you.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">No hesitation. No embellishment. Just the truth, simple and absolute.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha felt something tighten in her chest, something warm, something steady. Her lips curled into a small smile, one she did not bother to hide, </span>“I love you.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio smiled at that, soft and unguarded, before turning back to face the ocean. She settled into Agatha’s front, letting herself sink into the warmth of her, letting herself be </span> <span class="s2">held.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha wrapped her arms around her, locking them in place.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> For a while, neither of them spoke. The quiet rise and fall of the ocean filled the air around them, the tide rolling in always listening, waiting.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, quietly, Agatha murmured against the side of Rio’s head, her lips brushing just enough to be felt.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">“Tell me something about yourself that I don’t know,” The words came out softer than she intended, like a secret she wasn’t sure she was supposed to ask for.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t stiffen, but Agatha felt the small shift in her, the faint hesitation before she answered.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I had a family once,” Rio said finally, though something about it felt weightless, like it wasn’t entirely her own. </span>As Rio spoke, her fingers drifted, brushing against Agatha’s before moving deliberately to the ring on Agatha’s finger. She turned it slowly, almost absently, the pad of her thumb tracing over the band.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt the warmth of Rio’s touch, the absent way she toyed with the ring, as if grounding herself in something tangible. Agatha didn’t stop her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s2">“You had a family,”</span> <span class="s1"> Agatha echoed, watching Rio’s fingers as they moved, gentle but persistent.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio hummed in confirmation, still rolling the ring between her fingers.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s2">“I think so,”</span> <span class="s1"> she admitted, voice quieter now. </span> <span class="s2">“I don’t really remember them. Just… echoes. A voice here and there.”</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Rio’s thumb stilled for a moment against the band before resuming its slow movement, “I know they existed. I know they were mine. But time tends to swallow things when you’ve been around as long as I have.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2">“That doesn’t bother you?” Agatha asked. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio finally turned her head just enough to glance back, a small smile still lingering. </span> <span class="s2">“No,”</span> <span class="s1"> she said, her voice light. </span> <span class="s2">“If all I remember is warmth, then it must have been good, right?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha frowned slightly, watching the way Rio’s thumb traced slow circles against the metal of her ring. </span> <span class="s2">“You don’t wish you knew more?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I used to,” Rio said turning back to the sea, her voice softer now, as if the words were slipping out before she could decide whether to hold them back.</span> <span class="s2"> “Then you happened… and everything else in between.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha watched as Rio stared out toward the ocean, her expression caught somewhere between thought and memory before she turned back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2">“And suddenly that warmth that I barely remember, the one I never thought I would have again, the one I thought I lost forever.. it was back.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s fingers were still moving over the ring, still tracing the shape of something that had anchored her more than Agatha knew she would ever say aloud.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tightened her hold around her waist, pressing her lips lightly against the curve of Rio’s shoulder. She didn’t answer, but she didn’t need to.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They talked for a while, their voices quiet and easy. Agatha asked questions she had never thought to ask before, small things that did not feel urgent but still mattered. She learned that Rio had seen more of the world than she ever let on, that she liked waking up to the sound of birds but hated how early they started, that she couldn’t stand the cold but loved the way it made the air feel sharp and alive in her lungs. In return, Rio asked her things Agatha never expected. What was the first thing she had ever wanted? Was there a place that had ever felt like home in their time apart? Was there a smell that brought her back to something good?</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They let the conversation wander without direction, moving between memories and thoughts that had no real weight but still felt important. The day stretched on, and with Rio settled against her, warm and solid in her arms, Agatha thought that if this was what it meant to have her, then she never wanted for anything more.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha listened as Rio spoke about the differences between two plants, her voice the kind of tone she used when she was lost in thought. There was something soothing about the way Rio spoke, something effortless in the way she could explain a subject as if it had always been a part of her. Agatha hummed in acknowledgment, not because she was uninterested, but because she liked the sound of Rio’s voice. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without thinking, her hand drifted to the outside of Rio’s thigh, fingers tracing a slow path up and down. She felt the goosebumps rise beneath her touch, a quiet reaction that sent a spark of satisfaction through her. Rio didn’t pause, didn’t pull away, but Agatha felt the way her breath caught for just a fraction of a second before Rio continued speaking, the way her body became just a little more aware.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The </span> <span class="s3">pattern</span> <span class="s1"> of Agatha’s fingers stayed unhurried, light, absent in its intention but deliberate in its movement. Up and down, the tips of her fingers grazing warm skin, leaving a trail of sensation in their wake. Rio shifted slightly, as if trying to pretend she didn’t notice, but Agatha did. She noticed in the way Rio’s voice dipped for half a second, in the way she adjusted against Agatha’s front, in the way Rio’s fingers curled slightly into the blanket beneath them.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Still, Rio kept talking, </span> <span class="s3">calm</span> <span class="s1"> and composed, but now Agatha wasn’t listening to the words anymore. She was listening to </span> <span class="s3">Rio.</span> <span class="s1"> To the breaths between her sentences, to the way her body responded. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smirked slightly, her fingers never stopping their slow, lazy path. She let her touch drift higher, skimming over Rio’s thigh until she reached the point of her hip bone. Her fingers traced the thin string of Rio’s bikini where it rested against her skin, barely there, a teasing glide that lingered just long enough to see what Rio would do.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio swallowed. </span>And still, she kept talking.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha traced the top of Rio’s bathing suit bottoms across her waist, her touch </span> <span class="s3">lazy and intentional</span> <span class="s1">. Her finger skimmed just beneath the seam, barely there, teasing, warm against soft skin.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio hesitated.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">For a moment, Agatha thought she had finally broken her, that Rio might shift or react or even acknowledge what was happening between them. But instead, Rio took a steady breath, composed herself, and asked, </span> <span class="s3">“Which plant did I say is toxic when brewed incorrectly?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s3">“Foxglove.”</span> <span class="s1"> Agatha answered without hesitation, smooth and certain, she had been listening the entire time. Rio’s voice mattered just as much as the way her body responded beneath Agatha’s touch.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She dropped a kiss to Rio’s shoulder and she sure as fuck let it linger. Her lips pressed against warm skin, savoring the way Rio tensed, the way her breath hitched ever so slightly. Agatha did not pull away immediately, did not rush the moment. She let herself feel the heat of Rio’s skin beneath her mouth, let the silence stretch between them, craving every reaction it would pull from the green witch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio parted her lips like she wanted to say something, but all that came out was a breathless, </span> <span class="s3">“Oh.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha still had an arm draped across Rio’s stomach, and with a slow, deliberate pull, she drew her closer. Their bodies pressed together, the movement creating just enough friction as Rio’s hips shifted against Agatha’s front. The only sound Rio made was the faintest, breathy gasp, a soft hitch of air that barely escaped her lips yet sent a spark through Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had always been quiet in bed. That had never changed. Even the night before, through their many lingering, fevered rounds, Rio had been careful with her voice, offering her louder moans sparingly. Each one had been intoxicating, leaving Agatha hungry for more. And right now, that hunger was turning into determination. She wanted to know just how much Rio could give her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha brought the hand that had been resting on Rio’s thigh up, gently sweeping her hair away from her shoulder before pressing slow, open mouthed kisses against the newly exposed skin. Rio tilted her head in silent invitation, her breath coming quicker, deepening into something unsteady.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Another thing about Death- she had an insatiable appetite for tenderness. No matter how formidable she appeared, no matter the power she wielded, she folded at the touch of something gentle. Sweet words disarmed her more than any weapon ever could, slipping past her defenses with the ease of a whispered prayer. Death did not merely accept gentleness; she ached for it, drawn to adoration like a moth to a quiet, unwavering flame. She did not wish to be claimed or conquered. She wanted to be held as if she were something sacred.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha slid her arm beneath the one still wrapped around Rio’s stomach, her left hand gliding slowly up the length of her body, palm open as she traced over her waist, her ribs, her collarbone. When she reached Rio’s neck, Agatha shifted her grip, tilting Rio’s head ever so slightly to give herself better access. She pressed a lingering kiss just below her ear, lips barely grazing skin before she whispered, “You’re breathtaking.” </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio let out a quiet, shivery breath, something small and involuntary, neither a sigh nor a moan but something in between.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s fingers slipped from Rio’s throat to the nape of her neck, curling just enough to tug at the string of Rio’s red bikini top. She pulled it loose with ease, then let her hand fall away, moving back before the fabric even had time to slip from Rio’s body. The moment cool air brushed over exposed skin, Rio inhaled sharply, her breath catching in a way that sent a thrill through Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She made quick work of the second knot at Rio’s back, letting the top come undone completely. But instead of rushing forward, instead of taking or claiming, she let the side of her head rest against Rio’s, savoring the warmth between them. Agatha didn’t need to move. Not yet. She was content to listen, to feel, to memorize every sound Rio made, every shift in her breathing, every subtle reaction as if it were the most important thing in the world.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha brought both hands to the ties at Rio’s hips, fingers making quick work of the knots. With a single tug, the fabric loosened, the front falling open to bare her completely. But Agatha did not let her hands linger, not yet. The soft whimper Rio let out sent a pulse of heat through her, but she kept moving, dragging her hands upward with focused intent.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When her palms finally met the curves of Rio’s breasts, Agatha cupped them fully, savoring the warmth beneath her touch. The reaction was instant. Rio moaned, the sound slipping free before Death could stifle it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Fuck,” Agatha exhaled.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha brushed her fingertips over Rio’s nipples, teasing in slow motions. She lingered there, twisting, tugging, and stroking with just enough pressure to keep Rio on edge. With every movement, Rio’s breathing grew more uneven, each sharp inhale breaking into quiet, needy whimpers that only encouraged Agatha to continue. Every sound shot through Agatha like a spark, heat coiling deep in her core, her own hips beginning to roll, creating friction against the curve of Rio’s body.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Dragging a single finger back down Rio’s torso, she traced the path with agonizing slowness. Once she reached her destination, Agatha cupped Rio fully, pressing against her with a full palm. The moment Agatha made contact, a moan escaped both of them, Rio instinctively spreading her legs to invite more. The response sent Agatha sinking forward, her body melting into the warmth of Rio’s back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could feel just how wet Rio was, the heat and slickness against her palm making her pulse quicken. She craned her head over Rio’s shoulder, pulling her hand away just enough to watch the evidence of Rio’s arousal stretch and glisten on her hand. The sight alone sent a rush of desire through her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Oh my god,” Agatha breathed, almost in disbelief, her voice thick with want.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without hesitation, she moved her hand back, cupping Rio with purpose before pressing forward with a deliberate thrust. The response was immediate. Rio moaned, her voice barely above a whisper, a quiet, trembling, “Oh,” that sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine. Rio’s head fell back against Agatha’s, her body melting into the touch, surrendering without a second thought. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha slid two fingers up the length of Rio’s soaked heat, moving with deliberate slowness as she traced her way to the bundle of nerves at the top. Agatha circled it teasingly, never quite giving in, while her other hand remained occupied, rolling and pinching Rio’s nipple with practiced ease.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s head rested lazily against hers, her breaths coming in soft, needy whimpers. She spread her legs even further in her plea for more. Her hands gripped Agatha’s thighs, fingers digging in as if trying to ground herself, trying to contain the anticipation building inside her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha dragged her fingers lower, stopping just at Rio’s entrance without pushing in. Instead, she traced slow, torturous circles over it. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Fuck,” Rio moaned, frustration slipping into her voice, her hips twitching in search of more.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha only smirked against her shoulder. With one hand still teasing Rio, she brought the other to her own body, Agatha’s fingers finding their path beneath her own swimsuit bottoms. Agatha knew the moment Rio felt Agatha’s hand shift against her back and realization struck the green witch.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"><br/>A desperate moan spilled from Rio’s lips at the thought of what Agatha was doing, the sound unrestrained. It sent a bolt of pleasure straight through Agatha, pulling a moan from her in response. Agatha was just as wet. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She dipped her fingers through her own folds, gathering the slickness before slipping her hand from her bottoms. Bringing her fingers to Rio’s mouth, Agatha tilted her head slightly, angling her fingers in a way that coaxed Rio to slightly turn toward her, allowing Agatha to catch a glimpse of Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio took Agatha’s fingers without hesitation, lips parting instinctively as she wrapped her mouth around them. Her hand came up to grasp Agatha’s wrist, holding her there as she took her time, her head bobbing and her tongue teasing against Agatha’s skin. Agatha felt the warmth of Rio’s grip, but it was the glint of gold metal that caught her eye.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1"> The wedding ring on Rio’s finger sent something fiery and electric through Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Jesus Christ,” Agatha whispered, her voice barely holding steady. Between the look on Rio’s face- eyes half lidded, pupils blown wide, cheeks flushed with arousal and the undeniable proof of what they were wrapped around Rio’s finger, Agatha felt a rush of heat so intense it almost knocked the air from her lungs.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a brief moment, she almost convinced herself Rio had done it on purpose. Had positioned her hand just right, had made sure Agatha saw it. A tease, a reminder, a taunt wrapped in devotion. Whatever it was, it worked. Agatha was absolutely undone and she fucking whimpered… loudly. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha pulled her fingers from Rio’s mouth, her tongue leaving behind a lingering heat. Without hesitation, Agatha wrapped an arm around Rio, securing her in place as she plunged her fingers into Rio as deep as she could manage at this angle. The reaction was instant. Rio’s head fell back against her shoulder, her body arching as she cried out, the loudest moan yet spilling from her lips.<br/></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t stop. She set a steady rhythm, pumping her fingers into Rio, each movement deliberate, each thrust designed to unravel her completely.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Leaning in, she let her lips brush against Rio’s ear. “Baby,” Agatha crooned, her voice drenched in knowing, in control, in love. She felt the way Rio trembled, the way her breathing turned ragged. She was close, so close Agatha could feel it in the way her walls tensed around her fingers, in the way her thighs trembled against her own.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Do it for me,” Agatha whispered, her tone a plea.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s voice broke into a desperate whimper, her body straining for release. “Yes,” Rio gasped, her head rolling into the crook of Agatha’s neck, her fingers digging into Agatha’s thighs.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smiled against Rio’s temple, knowing exactly what would push her over the edge. “Please, my love,” Agatha murmured, her voice soft, coaxing, desperate.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And it worked.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio shattered with a cry, her release crashing over her in full force, her body trembling as she came hard and loud. Her strength gave out, and she melted against Agatha, her back pressing flush to Agatha’s chest as she rode out the aftershocks. Agatha held her close, her arm wrapped securely around Rio’s waist, feeling the rapid rise and fall of her breath. She let her lips graze the side of Rio’s head, reveling in the warmth of her, in the way she had completely given in. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Death had never feared the inevitable, never bent to the will of those who sought to control her. But tenderness? Sweet words? A touch that did not take but offered? Those would always be Death’s undoing. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And when Rio finally turned in Agatha’s arms, pressing their bodies together as she kissed her with the kind of hunger that felt like worship, Agatha tasted devotion on Rio’s lips. It felt like divinity itself, like a prayer that had never needed to be spoken because Rio had heard it all along.</span>

<p class="p1">
<span class="s1">When Agatha had woken before dawn, the air still thick with the hush of night, she had turned to Rio and murmured, “Walk with me? Watch the sunrise?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had blinked sleepily at her, then nodded without hesitation. And now, as they strolled along the shore, the sun beginning its slow ascent over the horizon. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The ocean stretched endlessly before them, restless and alive. The waves rolled in stronger than before, spilling farther up the shore before retreating. The sky was a canvas of deep purples and soft golds, the horizon just beginning to burn with the first light of dawn. The air was thick with salt, warm and cool all at once, the kind of morning that felt like a secret, something intimate and untouched.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But none of that held Agatha’s attention.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was walking beside her, and she was struggling.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She wasn’t making a sound, wasn’t saying a word, but Agatha could feel it in the way Rio carried herself. There was a tension to her, not rigid, not hesitant, but charged, like she was containing something. Her arms were crossed loosely over her chest, but Agatha could see the way her fingers flexed against her skin, curling and uncurling as if she didn’t know what to do with them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio wanted to touch her. She wanted to reach out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha knew because she had seen this before, had felt it before, back when Rio never second guessed these things. There had been a time when touch was second nature to her. A hand at the small of her back. Fingers brushing over her wrist. A lazy tug of her shirt just to pull her closer. It had never been forced, never been something Rio had to think about. It had been instinct.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But that was before things had gotten complicated. Before space had wedged itself between them. Before restraint had become something Rio had learned to live with.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But now, after yesterday, after Agatha had slid a ring back onto her finger with intent, Rio was holding herself differently. Not distant or guarded. But like she was bracing against something she wasn’t sure she was allowed to want.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could see it in the way Rio kept sneaking glances at her, in the way she inhaled just a little too deeply when their steps fell too close together. Rio wasn’t hesitant. If anything, she looked keyed in, like her body was operating on some frequency she hadn’t figured out how to turn off.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And Agatha fucking loved it. She could have made it easy. She could have brushed their hands together. She could have tilted her head and smirked just enough to say </span> <span class="s2">What are you waiting for?</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But she didn’t.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She let Rio want.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She let her ache for it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The ocean surged again, spilling up the sand, curling around their ankles before slipping away.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio exhaled, long and deep, and finally, she let her arms fall to her sides. Her fingers twitched once. Twice. And then, barely, they brushed against Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It lasted less than a second. But Rio’s breath hitched.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smiled, tilting her head slightly as she let her fingers trail idly along the side of her thigh. “Something on your mind?” Her voice was soft, teasing, like she was indulging a game she had already won.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio furrowed her brow, crossing her arms back over her chest with a huff. “No.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha almost felt bad for how much she was enjoying this. Almost.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Okay.” Agatha smiled and nodded as she kept walking, the word light and easy, like she wasn’t bothered in the slightest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio stopped.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha took a few more steps before realizing she was walking alone. She turned, finding Rio standing a few paces behind her, arms still crossed, lips pressed together in something that wasn’t quite a pout but close enough to make Agatha’s amusement deepen.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She raised an eyebrow, tilting her head slightly. “What?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t answer. She just stared at Agatha, something unreadable flickering behind those deep brown eyes. For a moment, Agatha thought Rio might let it go, might shake her head and fall back into step beside her like nothing had happened, but she didn’t.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She just stood there, unmoving, looking at Agatha like she had just been personally offended.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha sighed through her nose, amusement flickering in her chest as she stepped back toward Rio. She stopped in front of her, waiting, but Rio only turned her chin away, gaze fixed stubbornly on the horizon like the sunrise had suddenly become the most captivating thing she had ever seen.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha knew better… Rio was sulking. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sweetheart,” Agatha drawled, deliberately sweetening her tone.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s gaze flicked to the side, her eyebrows lifting just slightly- interest piqued, like that was exactly what she’d been waiting to hear. “I just think it’s funny.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha smirked, “Here we go.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I just think it’s funny that some people can’t even hold their wife’s hand,” Rio muttered. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re right,” Agatha said, the corners of her mouth twitching. “What kind of monster doesn’t hold their wife’s hand?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio looked at her, raising an eyebrow. “A truly evil one.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Without warning, Agatha reached out and gently tugged at Rio’s crossed arms, uncrossing them as though it were the simplest thing in the world.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Hey- !” Rio started to protest, but Agatha didn’t let her finish. She slid her hand into Rio’s, holding it firmly, but with a tenderness that made it all feel suddenly right.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s breath hitched, and for a moment, neither of them moved. Then, Rio gave a soft, reluctant smile. “Better,” she said, her tone softening.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">They walked in silence, hand in hand, their steps in sync, they didn’t need to say anything. The cool morning air wrapped around them as they strolled, the world feeling just a little bit smaller, a little bit more right with their fingers entwined. Everything else faded into the background, leaving only the quiet of the beach and the simple comfort of being together.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1">-</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The morning had unraveled slowly, and now, with the sun high overhead, the three of them had settled into the lull of the day. The ocean stretched endlessly before them, the waves rolling in and out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio sat beside Agatha in a lounge chair, fingers twitching against the armrest, then stilling, then starting again. It was the same hesitance from earlier, the same quiet struggle she thought she was hiding. Agatha had given her hand earlier, had let Rio feel the shape of it again, warm and steady against her own. But still, Rio wavered.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha shifted, stretching out her leg just enough that it brushed against Rio’s. A small touch, a whisper of warmth against her skin. It was enough to make Rio go still, enough to make her fingers pause mid tap. Agatha let the moment settle, let Rio have what she had been aching for without making a show of it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let her gaze drift over the water, barely listening as Sage, settled in the sand beside her, idly twisted a seashell between her fingers.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio had finally relaxed- or at least, she had stopped fidgeting so much. She still hadn’t moved her leg away from where Agatha’s brushed against it, hadn’t said a word about it either. Agatha let her stay in that quiet, let her keep the closeness without pushing it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Sage had no such mercy.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage had been testing Rio’s patience all morning, poking and prodding, waiting for her to break.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It started small- kicking sand too close to Rio’s legs, humming just off key, nudging her chair with the edge of her foot. Sharp little comments, casual but deliberate, each one a careful press against the limits of Rio’s restraint.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And Rio, for all her grumbling and heavy sighs, never truly stopped her. She let Sage push, let the game play out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage, ever the instigator, sat in the sand beside Agatha, sifting lazily through shells. “You know,” she mused, her voice carrying that telltale spark of trouble, “I read something the other day. Something that really stuck with me.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio, reclined in her chair, let out the slowest, most exhausted sigh. “I swear to God, Sage.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage smirked. “It goes… ‘Because I could not stop for-’”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio moved before the words even fully left her mouth.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage barely had time to scramble to her feet before Rio grabbed her wrist, yanking her up with no effort at all. She shrieked, breathless with laughter, twisting in Rio’s grip. “Wait-let’s talk about this-“ </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“No! You already talk too much!” Rio scoffed, already pulling her toward the water. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha simply watched, stretching out her legs, content to observe the chaos unfold.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage wasn’t </span> <span class="s2">really</span> <span class="s1"> trying to escape. She could have twisted out of Rio’s grip if she wanted to, could have sprinted in the opposite direction. But she didn’t. She let herself be dragged across the sand, breath hitching between laughter as Rio pulled her closer and closer to the waves.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Water lapped at their feet, cool against the heat of the day. Rio grinned, adjusting her grip, shifting her stance like she was making a show of weighing her options.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You won’t do it,” Sage taunted, still breathless. “You </span> <span class="s2">love</span> <span class="s1"> me too much.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio’s grin widened. “Oh, </span> <span class="s2">do</span> <span class="s1"> I?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And then she lifted Sage clean off the ground and </span> <span class="s2">dropped her straight into the ocean.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage hit the water with a splash, vanishing beneath the waves before resurfacing a second later, sputtering. She pushed her soaked hair out of her face, blinking through saltwater and sheer </span> <span class="s2">betrayal.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You traitor</span><span class="s2">,</span> <span class="s1">” she gasped.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio, standing knee deep in the surf, just crossed her arms. “Oh, so </span> <span class="s2">now</span> <span class="s1"> I’m a traitor?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage blinked at her, then lunged.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio yelped, stepping back, but Sage caught her wrist and </span> <span class="s2">pulled.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio stumbled forward, trying to regain her footing, but Sage took the opportunity to kick up as much water as possible, drenching her in one swift motion.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let herself sink deeper into her chair, the breeze shifting through her hair, the sun painting the sand in gold. She had no plans to step in, no desire to interfere.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She just wanted to watch.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because they were </span> <span class="s2">hers.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">-</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Now, Agatha sat out on the balcony with Sage, the two of them engaged in a game of chess. The board between them was beautifully crafted, an ocean themed set where each piece was shaped like sea creatures- knights as seahorses, rooks as coral towers, pawns as tiny shells. The board itself was a deep blue, swirling with hints of white like waves frozen in time.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage studied the board with sharp eyes, fingers resting against the edge of a piece, as if weighing every possible outcome.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha, for her part, took the moment to simply </span> <span class="s2">watch</span> <span class="s1"> her.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">There was something soothing about this- just the two of them, the steady back and forth of the game, the quiet that filled the space between each move. Sage wasn’t speaking much, but she didn’t have to. Agatha could </span> <span class="s2">feel</span> <span class="s1"> her thinking, the way she played out each scenario before even touching a piece.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha moved her bishop, then leaned back, gaze flicking briefly toward the horizon. The sun had started its descent, casting streaks of gold and orange across the water, reflecting in the glassy surface of the board.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">A peaceful evening. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Except, for once, it wasn’t Sage who broke the peace this time.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2">“What’s he like?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t look up from the board. She only hummed, waiting for more context, her fingers lightly tapping the top of a seashell shaped pawn.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha rolled her eyes, exhaling through her nose. She blamed the </span> <span class="s2">mushiness</span> <span class="s1"> of this trip. The warmth of it, the love, the peace- it was </span> <span class="s2">too much.</span> <span class="s1"> A crack in her carefully kept facade, making her feel open in a way she wasn’t used to. Vulnerable in a way she didn’t </span> <span class="s2">like.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Agatha still wanted to know.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She wanted to know what her </span> <span class="s2">son</span> <span class="s1"> was like.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">If he still looked the same. If time had changed him. If she would even recognize him now.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Nicky…” Agatha forced out, the name unfamiliar on her tongue after so many years. It felt heavier than she expected.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She kept her gaze on Sage, watching closely, waiting for even the smallest flicker of a reaction. Shock. Surprise. Sadness. Anything. Maybe even excitement that Agatha was finally opening up about this.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Sage didn’t move. She didn’t look up from the board.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Rio told me you see him sometimes,” Agatha continued, the words measured and careful. “When you sleep…”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t look up when she said it. She was studying the board more than usual, her fingers hovering over a piece.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“He’s fucking annoying.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha blinked. Stunned didn’t even begin to cover it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage seemed just as startled by her own words. She froze midway through moving her piece, fingers still resting on it as if her brain was only now catching up. Slowly, she lifted her gaze to Agatha, looking just as shocked as Agatha felt.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a long moment, neither of them spoke. The ocean murmured in the distance, the game between them forgotten.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage placed her piece down with more force than necessary, leaned back in her chair, and cleared her throat.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Sorry… I meant </span> <span class="s2">as</span> <span class="s1"> my brother.” Her voice was too light, too casual, the kind of correction meant to undo what had already slipped. She cast a glance to the side, fingers drumming once against the armrest before she shrugged. “He’s an annoying little brother.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t respond. She simply watched.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She had known Sage long enough to recognize when she was trying to control the narrative. Sage didn’t stumble through conversations, didn’t fumble with words, didn’t let things slip unless she wanted them to. She had an almost surgical awareness of a moment’s weight, knowing exactly what to say and when to say it to get the reaction she wanted. And yet, here she was, fumbling.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because she </span> <span class="s2">knew</span> <span class="s1"> what this was.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She knew how much it had taken for Agatha to ask. How unnatural it felt for her to let that crack form in the walls she had so carefully built. This wasn’t just a passing curiosity. It wasn’t small talk or some idle attempt to fill the silence between them. It was a step forward, a bridge between past and present, a question heavy enough that it </span> <span class="s2">meant something.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And rather than meeting it for what it was, Sage had done what she always did when things threatened to shift in ways she wasn’t ready for- she tried to shrink it down, make it harmless, pretend it wasn’t as big as it was.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let the silence stretch between them. She wasn’t going to let Sage talk her way out of this. She wasn’t going to let her dodge or twist it into something smaller. If Sage wanted to smooth it over, she would have to sit in the weight of her own words first. And from the way her fingers twitched against her knee, the way her mouth pressed into a thin line, Agatha knew Sage already regretted trying.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage shifted in her seat. Her fingers twitched again, this time against the armrest, a small, restless movement that told Agatha more than any words could. Sage wasn’t used to being caught like this, wasn’t used to not being able to twist a conversation into something easier, something that didn’t </span> <span class="s2">feel.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha </span> <span class="s1">stayed quiet, studying Sage, watching her uncomfortably </span> <span class="s2">sit</span> <span class="s1"> with it.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage exhaled sharply through her nose, rolling her shoulders back as if physically shaking off the tension. “Look, it’s not like we have deep, meaningful conversations,” she muttered, moving a piece on the board without really looking at it. “He shows up when he feels like it. Says something cryptic or annoying, and then he’s gone. I don’t even think he </span> <span class="s2">likes</span> <span class="s1"> me.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha raised an eyebrow. “He doesn’t like you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage scoffed, finally glancing up. “I think he tolerates me at best. Maybe.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha didn’t believe that for a second. If Nicky had been showing up, even in Sage’s dreams, there was a reason for it. There was </span> <span class="s2">something</span> <span class="s1"> tying them together, something neither of them had been willing to say outright.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And then, just as quickly as the thought came, another followed- </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2">Nicky would have fucking loved Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The realization came so suddenly, so obviously, that Agatha almost laughed. Of course, he would have. They were </span> <span class="s2">opposites</span> <span class="s1"> in every way that mattered. Nicky had been calm, patient, sweet in a way that had never been naïve. He had been steady, gentle, the kind of person who carried warmth without even trying. He had been </span> <span class="s2">a lot like Rio</span> <span class="s1"> in that way, always giving, always loving without hesitation.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And then there was Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage, who was fire and sharp edges, who met the world with wit and defiance, who never let herself be soft because she had never </span> <span class="s2">had</span> <span class="s1"> to be. She burned where Nicky had glowed. She challenged where he would have embraced. And </span> <span class="s2">he</span> <span class="s1">- god, he would have been obsessed with her.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could see it so clearly it almost hurt.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha squashed the thought just as quickly it came and Sage must have seen the doubt on Agatha’s face because she huffed, leaning forward with her elbows on the table, her expression shifting just slightly.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I don’t know what you want me to say,” Sage admitted, quieter this time, less defensive. “He’s not… he’s not some wise, all knowing spirit. He’s just a kid. Kind of a little shit, honestly.” She smirked, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. “He gets mad when I don’t listen to him, like I </span> <span class="s2">owe</span> <span class="s1"> him something. And then he just disappears again.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha watched her carefully. “And what does he say when you </span> <span class="s2">do</span> <span class="s1"> listen?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage hesitated. It was barely a flicker, barely a pause, but it was there.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha had her now.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage inhaled through her nose, sitting back again, arms crossed, suddenly looking anywhere but at her mother. “…Nothing useful.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That was a lie. Agatha didn’t call her on it, not yet, but she tucked it away. She could tell Sage was already regretting letting it get this far, that she was itching to steer it back into shallow waters, to make it something meaningless again.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha just let the moment linger and Sage was already shifting under it again, already looking for a way out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha picked up a piece from the board, rolling it between her fingers, keeping her gaze steady. “Nothing useful,” Agatha repeated, her voice even.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage scoffed, sinking further into her chair. “Yeah, you know, the usual. Cryptic nonsense. Half sentences. Acting like he knows everything.” She waved a hand in the air, but her movements were stiff, guarded. “Like I said, annoying.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha hummed, setting her piece back down without moving it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage ran a hand through her hair, still not looking at her. “He just- he thinks I should be doing something. That I’m wasting time.” She exhaled sharply. “Like he’s in any position to lecture </span> <span class="s2">me.</span> <span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha’s fingers stilled on the board. </span> <span class="s2">There it is.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage hadn’t meant to say it, not like that. The way her jaw tensed, the way her shoulders locked- it was clear she had let too much slip.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha could work with that.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She tilted her head slightly, studying Sage the way she might study an opponent in battle. Not with challenge, not with accusation, but with patience. “And what does he think you should be doing?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage finally looked at her then.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For a second, there was something sharp in her gaze, something unreadable but heavy, like she was trying to decide whether this conversation was worth finishing or if she should cut her losses and retreat.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then, just as quickly, she scoffed and looked away, shaking her head. “Who knows? He never actually </span> <span class="s2">says</span> <span class="s1"> it. Just dances around it like it’s some big secret I’m supposed to figure out on my own.” She crossed her arms, her frustration bleeding through. “I don’t have time for that.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha leaned back slightly, tapping a finger against the board. “Sounds like he’s waiting for you to figure it out.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage let out a breathy laugh, but there was no humor in it. “Then he’s going to be waiting for a long time.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was a lie.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha didn’t react, didn’t let her expression shift, but she </span> <span class="s2">knew.</span> <span class="s1"> She had known Sage long enough to recognize the subtle shifts in her- how she only dodged questions when she had something to hide, how she only brushed things off when they were already too close to the truth.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage </span> <span class="s2">knew</span> <span class="s1"> what Nicky wanted from her.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And she had already figured it out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha studied her carefully, watching the tension in her shoulders, the way her fingers curled just slightly against her arm. She was always so controlled, so deliberate in what she let slip and what she held back. But this? This wasn’t indifference.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It was avoidance.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Slowly, Agatha moved a piece on the board, not breaking eye contact as she did. “And if he’s not waiting?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage stiffened, just a fraction. It was so small most people wouldn’t have noticed it, but Agatha wasn’t most people.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I don’t know what you mean,” Sage muttered, too casual, too quick. She picked up a piece but didn’t move it, just turned it between her fingers. “I told you. He talks in circles. I’m not wasting my time trying to untangle it.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Another lie.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tilted her head slightly, voice still calm, patient. “Sage.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage sighed, shaking her head as she set the piece down, her mouth pressing into a thin line. For a moment, she just stared at the board, the ocean breeze shifting strands of hair across her face.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“He wants you to come home.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">At any other time, those words would have knocked the breath straight from Agatha’s lungs. And they did, just not enough to miss what was really happening.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage was still deflecting. She had dropped the truth like a distraction, like it was supposed to be enough to shift the focus off her. But Agatha knew better. She knew Sage wasn’t telling her everything.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t react right away. She let the words settle, watching Sage carefully.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage, for her part, didn’t fidget. Didn’t look away. But there was something in the way she held herself, something that felt too still. Like she was bracing for impact.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha tapped her fingers against the edge of the board. “That’s not all he said.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s expression didn’t change, but the silence stretched just a little too long.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a quiet hum. “You already figured it out, didn’t you?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage inhaled slowly through her nose. Not quite a sigh, not quite an admission.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, finally, she spoke.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I did.” Her voice was calm, measured, but not as detached as she wanted it to be. She moved a piece on the board, not even looking at it, just moving for the sake of doing something. “And I’m not sure if it’ll work.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t let Agatha respond. She wasn’t going to let her win that easily.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“He wants you to come home, Agatha.” This time, there was no softness to it. It was sharp, pointed, meant to land exactly where Sage wanted it to.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha grimaced at the sound of her own name coming from Sage’s mouth. It wasn’t just a name. It was a choice, a deliberate effort to put space between them, to remind Agatha of something she already knew but hated to acknowledge.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She wasn’t just Agatha to Sage anymore. At least, she didn’t see it that way. Agatha was her mother, whether she had earned the title or not. That was the truth of it, the thing that sat between them in moments like this, impossible to ignore.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And Sage had said it like that for a reason.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She had said it to sting.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And it </span> <span class="s2">fucking did.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage continued on her warpath, refusing to give Agatha room to breathe.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You know all those quotes and poems I’ve told you about? Rachel Carson and the ocean? It wasn’t just about your relationship with Rio.” Her voice was steady,“It was about death. Not the person. Just </span> <span class="s2">death.</span> <span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha stared at her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha had assumed the references were about Rio, about love, about the endless push and pull between them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But that had never been it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage had been talking about something bigger, something heavier, something Agatha hadn’t let herself hear until now.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I told you that I think it’s like a mirror,” Sage said, her voice even. “That it reflects. Whether you admit it or not, you’re dead. A ghost.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words landed heavy, but Sage didn’t give Agatha the chance to respond. She didn’t let her deflect or turn away from it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You’re going to move on at some point,” she continued, gaze steady. “And I don’t think it’ll look any different than what your life here looks like now.” Sage paused before adding, softer but no less certain, “Except you’ll have him back.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt something press against her chest, an ache that had no name.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t waver. She wasn’t trying to be cruel, wasn’t trying to twist the knife. This wasn’t meant to wound. It was just the truth, spoken as plainly as if she had already thought through every possible version of it and landed on the one that couldn’t be ignored.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And then, just as calmly, she finished with, “You can’t outrun death forever.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha didn’t flinch, but she </span><span class="s2">felt</span><span class="s1"> it. </span>Sage was right. And they both knew it.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But, just because Sage was right didn’t mean Agatha had to sit there and accept it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It wouldn’t look the same. It wouldn’t feel the same. Life, even in death, wouldn’t be what it was now. One huge part of her would be missing, ripped from her in a way she didn’t think she could stomach. The thought alone made her feel hollow.</span> <em> <span class="s1"><br/></span> </em></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha’s throat felt tight, her voice barely above a whisper when she finally spoke, </span>“She wouldn’t be there.”</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage didn’t ask who </span> <span class="s2">she</span> <span class="s1"> was. She didn’t need to. The truth of it was louder than any name Agatha could have said out loud.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“That’s not peace,” Agatha said, the words slipping out before she could stop them. They felt torn from somewhere deep, raw and exposed. She shook her head, her breath unsteady, like just saying it out loud made it all the more real.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Without her… with him and you, but not </span> <span class="s2">her-“ </span> <span class="s1">Her throat tightened, the thought sinking into her like a weight she couldn’t bear to carry. “That doesn’t sound like peace. That sounds like having my heart ripped out of my chest while I’m forced to sit there and watch.” She swallowed, but it did nothing to ease the ache blooming in her ribs. “Like standing still while everything that ever mattered is torn away, and I have to keep existing in the aftermath.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her fingers curled around the edge of the chessboard, grounding herself in something tangible, something real, because the alternative was letting herself spiral into the thought too deeply. She forced herself to breathe, to steady the anger rising beneath the grief.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“It wouldn’t be peace,” she said again, quieter now, but no less certain. “It would be hell.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She didn’t look at Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Listen…” Sage’s voice was softer now, but it didn’t waver. She wasn’t letting Agatha run from this, wasn’t letting her bury herself in the grief before it even had the chance to happen. “I’ll play into your pessimism, okay?” She exhaled, sitting back, meeting Agatha’s gaze head on.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“She wouldn’t be there. She </span> <span class="s2">can’t</span> <span class="s1"> be.” The words weren’t meant to be cruel, just honest, just </span> <span class="s2">true.</span> <span class="s1"> “Rio is Death. She’s always been Death. You moving on from here- she’s always known it would happen. It was never a question, never something she could stop.” Sage paused, letting that settle. “You can’t ask her to let you stay, not when you’re ready.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha swallowed, her jaw clenching, but Sage didn’t stop.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“She wouldn’t want you to.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It should have felt like a blade, like another crack splitting Agatha apart, but the way Sage said it… it wasn’t meant to be a punishment. It was something closer to mercy, even if Agatha didn’t want to hear it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Well, I’m not fucking ready,” Agatha shot back, the words coming meaner than she intended, but she didn’t care. She refused to accept this, refused to let Sage speak like the decision had already been made. Like there was some inevitable road she had to walk just because time demanded it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t flinch. She didn’t argue. She just watched Agatha for a moment, then nodded.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“That’s okay,” she said softly, her voice steady in a way that almost made Agatha angrier. “I’m in no rush either.” She exhaled, tilting her head slightly as if considering something before adding, “I’m sure Rio isn’t.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a slow breath, fingers twitching against the chessboard.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">That should have been a comfort. Maybe it </span> <span class="s2">was.</span> <span class="s1"> But right now, all it did was remind her that time wasn’t something she could fight. It would move with or without her, and eventually, </span> <span class="s2">eventually,</span> <span class="s1"> she would have to decide what came next.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But not today.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“You know how my mom is,” Sage said, treading carefully now, her voice soft. “Hell bent on the rules.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha exhaled through her nose, already tired of this conversation, already feeling where it was headed. “Sage, I don’t want to talk about this anymore.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I know! I </span> <span class="s2">know.</span> <span class="s1"> Just…” Sage hesitated, something flickering behind her eyes as she glanced to the side. “I’ve never been much of a rule follower myself.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">That made Agatha look up.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">There was something in the way Sage said it, something just outside of reach. It wasn’t just a throwaway remark. There was intent behind it, a quiet certainty, like she had already made up her mind about something Agatha didn’t yet understand.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And for whatever reason, that realization settled into Agatha’s chest like something warm and immovable. She wasn’t sure if it was pride or something more complicated, but it was there all the same.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage was </span> <span class="s2">hers.</span> <span class="s1"> She always had been.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Even without Agatha there to raise her, without her guidance, without her influence, Sage had still turned out </span> <span class="s2">exactly</span> <span class="s1"> like her. She wasn’t the kind of person who followed rules. She never had been. She didn’t wait for permission, didn’t accept limitations as absolutes. She paved her own way, tore through whatever stood in front of her, and </span> <span class="s2">dared</span> <span class="s1"> the world to tell her no.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And Agatha didn’t know what Sage was planning, what she wasn’t saying, but she knew one thing for certain.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">If there was a rule in her way, Sage was already figuring out how to break it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s1">A loophole. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Before Agatha could question it, the ocean roared. It wasn’t the steady crash of waves that had accompanied their conversation all afternoon or the soothing pull of the tide rolling in and out. This was something different, something violent, as if the sea itself had been listening and decided to expose them. The sudden shift startled them both, the air thick with the sharp scent of salt and something else, something electric that made the hairs on Agatha’s arms rise.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then came the scream.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It wasn’t just a yell. It was a demand, a furious eruption from inside the house, tearing through the quiet like a blade through silk. There was no mistaking the raw rage in it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“WHERE IS SHE?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words rang through the air, vibrating through the walls and slamming into them with the same force as the ocean’s sudden fury. Agatha felt it settle deep in her chest, coiling around her ribs like something clawing to get out.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She turned to Sage, “What did you do?”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage had never looked like this. She was always a step ahead, always prepared with a retort or a plan before anyone else even realized they needed one. But now, she wasn’t quick. She wasn’t calculating. She wasn’t moving at all.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage was </span> <span class="s2">stuck,</span> <span class="s1"> her body locked in place as if even breathing too loudly might make things worse.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha had seen her in every state imaginable- angry, smug, frustrated, defiant- but never like this. Fear wasn’t an emotion Sage let take hold, not in a way that showed, not in a way that made her seem </span> <span class="s2">small.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But here she was, staring at Agatha with wide, unguarded terror, her fingers gripping the edge of her chair like she needed something to hold on to. </span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And that told Agatha everything she needed to know.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The back door slid open with such force that Agatha was surprised the glass didn’t shatter. The violent sound of it ripping through the air sent a shock of tension crackling down her spine. Before she even turned her head, she </span> <span class="s2">felt</span> <span class="s1"> the fury rolling off of Rio in waves.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And then there she was, storming toward them, looking angrier than Agatha had ever seen her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">This wasn’t the kind of anger that came from frustration or wounded pride. It wasn’t the sharp, cutting rage of an argument between lovers. This was something deeper, something hotter, something </span> <span class="s2">dangerous.</span> <span class="s1"> Rio didn’t just look furious- she looked </span> <span class="s2">wrathful.</span> <span class="s1"> She looked like </span> <span class="s2">Death,</span> <span class="s1"> even without wearing its face.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her steps were unrelenting, her presence swallowing the space between them as she marched straight for the table. Before Agatha could process what was happening, Sage shot up from her seat, moving on instinct. The chair behind her flew back and crashed onto the ground, forgotten the moment it left her hands. Sage didn’t hesitate, didn’t waver, just turned to face Rio head on, squaring her shoulders like she was preparing for a fight.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The moment stretched, thick with something volatile, and then Rio slammed a brown leather notebook down onto the table. The force of it sent their chess game flying, pieces scattering across the surface before tumbling into the sand below.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“What the </span> <span class="s2">fuck</span> <span class="s1"> is this?” Rio’s voice wasn’t raised, but it didn’t need to be. The raw power behind her words made the air feel heavier, pressing against Agatha’s ribs, suffocating in its intensity.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s eyes flicked to the notebook, and recognition struck her like a bolt of lightning. She had seen it before. The first time Sage had dragged her into Rio’s realm, it had been there, something that Sage had brushed off.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">‘That’s my collection of graphic smut I’ve written over the years, so if you value your blue eyeballs, I’d suggest leaving it alone.’</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage’s voice had been so serious when she said it, her expression unreadable, her tone devoid of its usual mischief. She had kept her grip steady on Agatha’s wrist, making sure she didn’t reach for it, making sure she didn’t pry.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">‘Nosiness doesn’t suit you,’she had added with a casual shrug, brushing off the entire moment like it wasn’t worth lingering on. Like there was nothing to question, nothing to find.</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha had let it go.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She shouldn’t have.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Now, standing in the thick weight of Rio’s fury, staring at the very same notebook as it sat between them on the table, she felt the undeniable truth settle deep in her chest.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage had lied to her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And whatever was inside that notebook was the reason Rio was </span> <span class="s2">this</span> <span class="s1"> angry, </span> <span class="s2">this</span> <span class="s1"> unhinged, </span> <span class="s2">this</span> <span class="s1"> unlike herself.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t know what was written in those pages.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But she knew it wasn’t smut.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Then Sage, </span> <span class="s2">stupid, relentless Sage,</span> <span class="s1"> who seemed to exist for the sole purpose of testing Rio, of pushing her past every limit, of defying the very nature of who she was, </span> <span class="s2">opened her mouth and breathed.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“It must be.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She said it like she was releasing a weight she had been carrying for too long, like the words had been waiting to be spoken.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha felt them hit her with a force so brutal it nearly knocked the breath from her lungs. It was like being hit by a </span> <span class="s2">fucking bus.</span> <span class="s1"> Her stomach twisted, nausea creeping up her throat as the memory crashed over her, sharp and unforgiving.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She had heard those words before.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She had </span> <span class="s2">felt</span> <span class="s1"> them before.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The last time they had been spoken, Rio had stood at a distance, watching Agatha. </span> <span class="s2"><em>It must be</em>,</span> <span class="s1"> she had said, delivering a truth that Agatha had fought against with everything she had. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And now, Sage had dragged those words back into the light, using them like a weapon, knowing exactly where to aim.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha thought she might be sick.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But if those words had nearly shattered her, they did something far worse to Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The air pressed down on them, humming with an energy that made it suffocating. Rio didn’t move at first. She stood there, too still, too quiet, the kind of quiet that was </span> <span class="s2">scary.</span> <span class="s1"> Her breath was slow, controlled, but her hands had curled into fists so tightly that Agatha could see the tension running through her entire body.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage had known exactly what she was doing when she said it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And now, there was no stopping what came next.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Don’t you ever-” Rio pointed a finger in Sage’s face, her breath ragged, like she was teetering on the edge. But instead of finishing whatever she was about to say, she took a step back, forcing herself to hold </span> <span class="s2">something</span> <span class="s1"> in.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It didn’t work.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s fury didn’t settle. It didn’t lessen. It only grew.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You </span> <span class="s2">stupid</span> <span class="s1"> fucking child.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage looked like she had just been punched in the gut.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The words hit with brutal force, stripping away whatever steel she had wrapped herself in. Her face barely changed, but Agatha saw it. The flicker of hurt, the way her breath caught in her throat, the way her shoulders tensed like she had just taken a hit she hadn’t been expecting.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio, caught in the storm of her own rage, didn’t notice. Or if she did, she didn’t care.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You think you know </span> <span class="s2">everything,</span> <span class="s1"> but you </span> <span class="s2">don’t!</span> <span class="s1">” Her voice cracked through the space between them, her anger completely unfiltered. “You don’t know what it’s like to make </span> <span class="s2">real</span> <span class="s1"> choices. You don’t know what it means to </span> <span class="s2">lose</span> <span class="s1"> something and have to live with it, knowing it was your fault. You don’t know anything</span> <span class="s1">, but you sure as fuck love running your fucking mouth like you do!”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t speak, didn’t move, didn’t do anything but stand there, taking it all in.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“And </span> <span class="s2">you!”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio turned on Agatha next, her voice dripping with something just as furious, but filled with something deeper, something </span> <span class="s2">wounded.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Did you know about this?” The words tore out of her like they hurt to say. “Was this some </span> <span class="s2">big fucking plan</span> <span class="s1"> between the two of you? Have you both just been </span> <span class="s2">toying</span> <span class="s1"> with me, sitting back and </span> <span class="s2">laughing</span> <span class="s1"> while I let myself believe-”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio stopped herself, like saying it out loud was a step too far, like admitting she had </span><span class="s2">believed</span><span class="s1"> in something would shatter whatever she had left. </span>Her breathing was heavy, ragged, but she forced herself to keep going.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“Did any of this mean </span> <span class="s2">anything?</span> <span class="s1"> Or has it all just been one long fucking joke to you? Manipulating me like I’m the universe’s </span> <span class="s2">biggest fucking idiot?</span><span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And all Agatha could do was shake her head because, for once, she </span> <span class="s2">truly</span> <span class="s1"> had no fucking idea what was happening.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio turned back to Sage, her gaze burning.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“I have </span> <span class="s2">given</span> <span class="s1"> everything. Every fucking piece of me. And for what? For you to throw my own words back in my face? For you to </span> <span class="s2">lie</span> <span class="s1"> to me? Is that all I am to you?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage had taken the first blow with nothing but a flicker of hurt, had stood still while Rio threw every ounce of her fury at her. But this, these last words, the accusation behind them, the </span> <span class="s2">truth</span> <span class="s1"> in them. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage looked </span> <span class="s2">gutted.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her throat bobbed, her hands shaking at her sides. She looked like she wanted to say something, to fight back, to push against it like she always did, but she </span> <span class="s2">couldn’t.</span> <span class="s1"> Because Rio had </span> <span class="s2">meant it.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And for the first time, Agatha saw something she had never seen before in Sage.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She saw </span> <span class="s2">regret.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Rio’s breath came hard and uneven, fury rolling off her, swallowing everything around them. She wasn’t just angry. She wasn’t just hurt. She was </span> <span class="s2">finished.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Her gaze burned into Sage, something final settling in the way she looked at her.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“This will never happen.” The words left no room for argument. “Not today, not tomorrow, not ever. And the fact that you even thought it could? That you believed, for even a second, that you had the right to </span> <span class="s2">touch</span> <span class="s1"> something like this, to twist it into whatever you wanted-” She exhaled sharply, shaking her head in something like disbelief.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You’re not my daughter.. Not when you’re standing there, acting like this, pretending you understand things you </span> <span class="s2">can’t.</span> <span class="s1"> Right now, you’re no different than anyone else who thought they could control what was never theirs to touch.”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage flinched. It was small, barely there, but Agatha saw it. She </span> <span class="s2">felt</span> <span class="s1"> it. The moment the words landed, the exact second they shattered something deep inside her. For all her bravado, for all the ways she had braced herself for Rio’s rage, she had not braced herself for this.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And still, Rio didn’t stop. She didn’t soften.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You think you </span> <span class="s2">matter</span> <span class="s1"> in this?” Her voice was colder now, it dug deep, meant to make sure this moment stayed with Sage. “That you can put your hands in something ancient, something bigger than you, and expect it to bend to </span> <span class="s2">you?</span> <span class="s1"> You don’t matter, Sage. Not in this. Not to them. And if you keep pushing, if you keep </span> <span class="s2">playing</span> <span class="s1"> at something you don’t understand, you never fucking will!”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Silence followed, still heavy and suffocating.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t speak. She didn’t fight back. She just stood there, shoulders squared like she wanted to hold her ground, but the rest of her said otherwise. Her hands curled into fists, not in defiance but as if she were holding herself together, as if letting go for even a second would mean breaking apart completely.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio took a step back, exhaling sharply through her nose, but it didn’t sound like relief. It sounded like restraint, like she was holding something else in, something worse.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I hate-“</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“</span> <span class="s2">RIO</span> <span class="s1">!”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha’s voice struck like thunder. It wasn’t desperate, wasn’t a plea. It was a command, a </span> <span class="s2">line in the sand,</span> <span class="s1"> and she would not let Rio cross it.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whatever had happened, however deep the betrayal ran, however furious Rio had every right to be, </span> <span class="s2">Agatha would not let her finish that sentence.</span> <span class="s1"> She would not let those words exist between them, would not let Rio put something into the world that could never be taken back.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio’s jaw clenched, her breath hitching like she had to physically bite down on what she had almost said. Her hands were still fists at her sides, her entire body tense with something too large to hold. She shut her mouth, shook her head once, like she was resetting, like she was forcing herself to walk away before she said something else she would regret.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then she turned and left without another word.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The silence that followed was unbearable.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage didn’t move. She stood frozen, staring at nothing, looking hollow in a way Agatha had never seen before. Like something in her had just been carved out, like she had just lost something she never thought she </span> <span class="s2">could</span> <span class="s1"> lose.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Agatha was </span> <span class="s2">fucking trembling.</span> <span class="s1"> Her fingers curled uselessly against the arms of her chair, her breath shallow, her pulse hammering so hard in her chest it felt like it might break through her ribs. She had no idea what to make of this, no idea what had just happened in front of her.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Rio was gone, disappeared inside. Then, the first drops of rain began to fall.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">It didn’t pour. There was no thunder, no violent storm tearing through the horizon. The rain came slow and heavy, thick drops landing with a soft, hollow rhythm against the balcony, against the sand, against skin.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha turned her gaze to Sage and felt something in her chest tighten.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">She still hadn’t moved. She stood motionless, still facing the door, her body eerily still as the raindrops kissed her skin. Her green eyes burned against the pale cast of her face, </span> <span class="s2">haunting. </span> <span class="s1">The rain clung to her lashes, trailed down her cheeks, settling against her skin. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">But Sage wasn’t crying.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The sky was.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It rained for </span> <span class="s2">her.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Not grief. Not mourning. It was a sadness Sage would never admit to, a wound she would never touch, something deep, </span> <span class="s2">so fucking deep,</span> <span class="s1"> that even nature itself had no choice but to feel it.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">And Sage, for all her fire, for all the ways she had spent her life never letting the world </span> <span class="s2">see</span> <span class="s1"> her break, didn’t wipe the raindrops away.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha breathed out, barely above a whisper, “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage didn’t react right away. No sharp retort, no forced indifference, no attempt to make light of what had just happened. She only faltered in the way her chin dipped slightly, her gaze shifting just enough to glance at Agatha from the corner of her eye, like she had momentarily forgotten she wasn’t alone.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage just shook her head, then turned her attention back to the door.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">The rain kept falling, steady and relentless, soaking into her skin, clinging to her hair, running in thin trails down her face like tears she refused to shed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha reached for the notebook, her fingers trembling slightly as she flipped it open. Her eyes skimmed over the pages, words jumping out at her in fragments, scattered pieces of a puzzle she hadn’t known existed.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Her gaze caught on certain words, ones that stood out even among the chaotic scrawl. </span><em><span class="s2">Retire. </span><span class="s2">Prophecy.</span> <span class="s2">Nicky.</span> <span class="s2">Sage.</span> <span class="s2">Rio.</span></em> <span class="s2">Her own name.</span><span class="s1"> The terms repeated throughout the pages, tangled into thoughts too dense for Agatha to understand in an instant. But what made her chest tighten, what made her grip on the notebook stiffen, were the diagrams. The charts. </span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">At the center of it all, written in bold, unshakable ink, was </span> <span class="s2">Rio’s name.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha turned the page, moving faster now, flipping through without care for the fragile paper beneath her fingertips.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<em> <span class="s2">‘The cycle cannot continue as it is.’</span> </em>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Beneath it, written in the same slanted script, was something older, something Sage must have uncovered long before she ever put it to paper.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p>
<em>‘Death does not pass. It endures. Without heir. Without end. But when the cycle strains against its own nature, something will rise- They will not be born of prophecy, but of failure in the original design. And the balance, if altered by what it could not predict will find a way to hold.’</em>
</p><p> </p><p class="p1">Agatha’s blood ran cold.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t stated outright, but Agatha understood the implication. If something rose to hold the balance, it meant something else had to step aside.</p><p class="p2"> </p><p>Sage wasn’t inheriting Death. That wasn’t how the cycle worked. The role didn’t pass down through bloodlines or prophecy. It wasn’t offered, and it certainly wasn’t something that could be taken. Death had always endured- constant, unchanging, beyond the reach of anything as fickle as want.<br/><br/></p><p> </p><p>And yet, Sage had written this down like it was possible. As if the cycle could bend. As if Death could be… retired.</p><p> </p><p>It was a flaw in the foundation. A possibility no one had accounted for.<br/><br/></p><p> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s hands tightened around the notebook, her breath shallow as she stared down at the evidence sprawled across the pages.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Sage was doing this for them.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">For Agatha. For Nicky.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">For </span> <span class="s2">Rio,</span> <span class="s1"> so she could finally rest.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s fingers hovered over the last phrase on the page, one scrawled smaller than the rest, almost like a whisper, almost like something Sage hadn’t been sure she wanted to admit.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s2">‘<em>The end of one. The beginning of another.’</em></span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“You are </span> <span class="s2">fucking</span> <span class="s1"> insane.” Agatha’s voice came out quiet. She exhaled slowly, her grip tightening around the edges of the notebook as if holding it any looser would make all of this </span> <span class="s2">real.</span> <span class="s1"> She looked up, searching Sage’s face, but she was still staring at the door Rio had disappeared behind, unmoving, unreadable.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage scoffed, but there was no real bite to it, no amusement, only something tired. “She has to be </span> <span class="s2">willing.</span> <span class="s1">” She lifted her arm, gesturing toward the door as if it proved her point. “Did </span> <span class="s2">that</span> <span class="s1"> look willing to you?”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t answer.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">They stood there, facing each other, two women who had never been denied by Death. She had never told them </span> <span class="s2">no.</span> She <span class="s1">had answered them, bent where they willed her, given when they reached for her. They had both taken from her before, without hesitation, without permission, and Death had always let them.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">That was the undeniable truth staring them both in the face. Death had never been a force without will, never been a mantle that simply </span> <span class="s2">passed</span> <span class="s1"> to the next. She had </span> <span class="s2">choice.</span> <span class="s1"> She had </span> <span class="s2">agency.</span> <span class="s1"> And Rio had just made hers.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She wasn’t going to do it.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Not today. Not tomorrow. Not ever.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">It wasn’t reluctance. It wasn’t something that could be worn down or reasoned with. This was absolute, final, a truth as immovable as the cycle itself. Agatha had </span> <span class="s2">felt</span> <span class="s1"> it when Rio spoke. There had been no doubt, no crack, no space for argument.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And Sage, had never accounted for that.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">For once, Death had told her </span> <span class="s2">no.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage looked like she was fighting a </span> <span class="s2">fucking</span> <span class="s1"> meltdown. Not just at being told no, not even at her plan falling apart before it had the chance to begin, but because of every single word Rio had thrown at her. The accusations. The rejection. The sheer </span> <span class="s2">fury</span> <span class="s1"> behind it all.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sage’s hands were curled into fists at her sides, shoulders locked up so tight it looked painful, breath uneven like she was struggling to keep it together, like if she let go of whatever was holding her upright, she might actually </span> <span class="s2">fall apart.</span> <span class="s1"> It wasn’t just frustration. It wasn’t just anger. It was something far worse.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">For all of Sage’s sharp words, for all her calculated moves, for all her arrogance, there had always been one thing that remained certain- Rio had </span> <span class="s2">never</span> <span class="s1"> turned her away. She had argued with her, yelled at her, gotten frustrated beyond reason, but she had never cast her aside. Never looked at Sage like she was nothing. Never </span> <span class="s2">denied</span> <span class="s1"> her. Not like this.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">And Sage, who had never once cared about permission, who had spent her life defying expectation, who had never let anything shake her before, looked shaken.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">She swallowed, jaw tightening, her entire body going stiff like she could force herself not to react. Then she exhaled, the breath slow, steady, controlled.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“I’ll see you guys at home.”</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Flat. Emotionless. Too steady to be real.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">“Sage, wait!” Agatha moved to grab her, her fingers barely brushing the space where her daughter had been standing before Sage stepped forward and vanished through a portal without so much as a glance back.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a breath, her body coiled too tight, her mind trying to catch up with what had just happened.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1">
<span class="s1">Then, before she could stop herself, before she could even think, the anger ripped through her like an uncontainable force.</span>
</p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">“</span> <span class="s2">FUCK!</span> <span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p class="p1"><span class="s1">The word tore out of her throat, raw and violent, her fingers digging into the notebook still clutched in her hands. She thought about throwing it, thought about burning it, thought about </span><span class="s2">something,</span> anything to<span class="s1"> shake this feeling sitting in her chest.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1">Everything had just turned to shit. </p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p1"> </p>

<p>Agatha couldn’t make sense of what had just happened. Too much information had been thrown at her in the worst possible way, and she couldn’t begin to process any of it. Sage’s plan, whatever it had been, had fallen apart, but right now, none of that mattered. The only thing Agatha cared about was her daughter. How she was after Rio had unleashed every cruel word she could think of at their daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, the woman Agatha had once known as well as her own name, had raised Sage with a love so deep it had seemed effortless. She had nurtured her, cared for her, like being a mother was something written into her very bones. They were everything to each other. Before Agatha, Rio had been alone. Then Agatha had come into her life, and things had grown complicated. Then Sage had come along, and suddenly, Rio hadn’t been alone anymore. Sage hadn’t been alone. They had found something in each other.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had sat there and watched Rio destroyed it.</p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t been an argument. That word was too small for what had happened. Sage hadn’t fought back. She hadn’t said a word. She had simply stood there, silent, as Rio tore into her. And that, more than anything, made Agatha’s stomach twist. Sage, who never backed down from anything. Sage, whose sharp tongue and unshakable defiance had always made her impossible to ignore. Sage, who had spent her entire life contending. Yet, when it had mattered most, she had stood there and let her mother tear her apart like she was nothing.. like she deserved it.</p><p> </p><p>That didn’t feel like a fight. It felt like a fucking massacre.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had to be honest with herself. It was taking everything in her not to storm into that damn beach house, grab Rio by the ear, and drag her back home to face what she had done. To force her to look Sage in the eye and apologize. It was taking everything not to march inside and throw words just as cruel as the ones Rio had hurled at their daughter. To wound her the way she had wounded Sage. To tear her apart and make her feel the same unbearable sting of those words.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha wasn’t that person anymore. She wouldn’t hurt Rio just to make her suffer. She wouldn’t lash out just because the emotions surging inside her were too twisted to sort through. She had done that before. Let fear sink its claws into her, let it twist her love into something completely unrecognizable and so, so fucking cruel. Agatha had always lit the match first, because it was easier to reduce everything to ash before the flames could reach her.</p><p> </p><p>So she stood there, fists clenched at her sides, forcing herself to breathe through the chaos raging inside her. Forcing herself to stay. To sit with the anger, with the hurt, instead of unleashing it. She would not go into that house and tear into Rio the way Rio had torn into Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Because no matter how much Rio deserved to be dragged back and made to face what she had done, Agatha knew more than anyone that malice wouldn’t fix this. It never had.</p><p> </p><p>Once Agatha was certain she could hold her tongue- could refrain from saying anything mean to her lovely, beautiful, very sweet wife (a necessary reminder to herself)- she took a breath.<br/><br/></p><p>Somehow, against all odds, Agatha had absolutely nothing to do with the absolute dumpster fire that had just unfolded in front of her.<br/><br/></p><p><em>A truly shocking accomplishment, well done, Agatha.</em> <br/><br/></p><p>Agatha made her way through the beach house and up to their room, refusing to let emotions dictate her steps. When she reached the doorway, she found Rio furiously packing- or at least attempting to. Furiously would have been the wrong word for it. There was too much control in the way her hands moved, too much precision in the way each item was folded and placed with care. Even if the clothes were dirty, even if none of this made sense, Rio would never just throw things into a bag. Order was her anchor, the one thing she could cling to when everything else slipped through her fingers.</p><p><br/>Agatha stepped inside, crossing her arms loosely over her chest. Rio’s back was turned, her posture tense, her head slightly bowed as she hovered over the half packed bag.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could speak, Rio did first.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you know?” She didn’t turn around. Didn’t even glance up. Her voice was steady, but something about it felt off.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha answered truthfully.</p><p> </p><p>Rio must have believed her, because she didn’t argue. Didn’t push back. She only nodded slightly before returning to the task in front of her, folding another shirt like it was the only thing that mattered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated. “Sag-”</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t.” Rio’s voice was quiet but firm. Her hands stilled mid fold, fingers gripping the fabric a little too tightly.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t say her-” Rio stopped herself, exhaling sharply. “I can’t.” She swallowed hard. “I don’t want to talk about it.” The words tumbled out too quickly, as if saying them any slower would force her to feel them.</p><p> </p><p>Still, Rio didn’t turn around. Didn’t meet Agatha’s eyes. She just kept folding.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, inhaling deeply as she reminded herself- <em>I didn’t come here to argue.</em> She repeated it like a silent chant, an attempt to steady herself, to not let Rio’s behavior pull her into something neither of them could afford right now.</p><p> </p><p>But restraint had never been Agatha’s strong suit.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t think that was a bit much?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned sharply, her movements quick and precise, her expression carved from stone, but the anger in her eyes was unmistakable. “I think it was appropriate,” she shot back, her voice clipped.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at her, at a complete loss. Rio had always been the rational one, the voice of reason. But this wasn’t Rio. This was Lady Death- unyielding, absolute, so entangled in duty that she couldn’t even see the destruction she had left in her wake.<br/><br/><br/></p><p>She had to remind herself to breathe, to keep her voice even, to not let frustration win. Agatha wasn’t here to fight. She had told herself that before stepping through that door.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>My wife is beautiful. And kind. And loving…</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>And she is also making me want to throttle her.<br/><br/></em>
</p><p>Agatha inhaled slowly, jaw tightening. <em>She is beautiful. And sweet. And so very lovely.<br/></em></p><p> </p><p>But god help her, she was also impossibly infuriating.</p><p> </p><p>“Appropriate?” Agatha repeated, disbelief threading through her tone. She couldn’t help the humorless laugh that escaped her, “You just verbally eviscerated our daughter.”</p><p><br/>“She’s lucky I didn’t do worse,” Rio snapped, her voice rising.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened, disgust twists across her face as anger surged through her. “And what exactly would you have done?” Her words were challenging, daring Rio to push this further.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing.</p><p> </p><p>The answer was nothing and they both knew that. <br/><br/></p><p>Rio could raise her voice, could act like she was capable of worse, but it was all just noise. All just anger looking for a place to go. She wouldn’t have done anything. She never would.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio seemed determined to make this as difficult as possible, pushing her, testing the limits of Agatha’s patience like she wanted a fight. And Agatha, who had sworn she would not let herself be dragged into one, could feel her resolve slipping.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you hear yourself?” Agatha demanded, “I mean, seriously.”</p><p> </p><p>“Loud and fucking clear.” Rio’s words were slow, each one landing like a strike meant to bruise.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned away from her, her hands shaking with disbelief. It was almost comical, truly. She let out another exasperated laugh, sharp and humorless, before spinning back around. “Are you serious?” Her voice came out incredulous, disbelieving. She flung an arm toward the window, gesturing outside- back to where it had all happened, where Sage had stood, where Rio had spat venom at their own daughter, “You practically disowned her! You spoke to her like she was nothing! You told her she was nothing!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was shouting, but not in anger. It was a plea for Rio to hear herself, to understand the gravity of what she had just done.</p><p> </p><p>“And she needed the reminder!” Rio’s voice rose to meet hers, but there was no desperation in it, only anger.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s cocky! She runs her mouth! She has never taken a goddamn thing seriously in her life! She doesn’t think! She’s chaos!” Rio’s eyes burned ferociously, her breath coming faster. Then, just as Agatha opened her mouth, Rio cut her off- </p><p> </p><p>“Remind you of anyone?” The question came fast, leaving no time to process, no space for an answer before Rio’s voice cracked through the air again. “Huh?” demanding an answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulders dropped, the words hitting her like a punch she should have seen coming.</p><p> </p><p>Cruel.</p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck it. Two could play this game</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled, her tone leveling, her voice dropping into something extremely cold. “Yeah, actually,” she said with a slow nod, no longer shouting. “She does.”</p><p> </p><p>She stepped closer, gaze locked on Rio’s, unwavering. “So here’s a tip for the next time you feel like playing the role of a cunt mother- ” Agatha leaned in, just enough to ensure the words would land exactly where she intended them to.</p><p> </p><p>“Call her evil.” Agatha paused, “Tell her you should have killed her the moment she left your body.”</p><p> </p><p>Silence.</p><p> </p><p>The words hung between them, heavy, poisonous, familiar.</p><p> </p><p>“Might sting a little more,” Agatha said, almost matter of fact, like it was honest advice. She didn’t need to shout, she knew Rio would feel it in her bones.</p><p> </p><p>Rio knew better than anyone how deeply Evanora Harkness had scarred her daughter. How she had been the one to strike the first match, setting an inferno inside Agatha’s chest that had never gone out. Like a dealer offering the first taste, Evanora had spoon fed Agatha her own brand of destruction- until chaos became the only thing that felt like home.</p><p> </p><p>The thing is, Agatha Harkness was not born evil. A menace? Absolutely. Stubborn to a fault? Without question. A walking, talking natural disaster? On her best days. But evil? No. That was Evanora. And she had poured every ounce of it into Agatha, pressed it into her hands, whispered it into her ear until it took root.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora reaped what she sowed. And Agatha? Agatha soaked up every last drop like she did with stolen power, hungry and insatiable.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had known that. Had seen it firsthand.</p><p> </p><p>Most assumed Agatha met Death for the first time the night she killed her entire coven. They were wrong. It had happened the week before.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had always wanted more. More knowledge, more power, more understanding of what lay just beyond the boundaries set for her. Magic had been kept from her, locked away behind warnings and rules she had never cared to follow. And when her coven refused to teach her, when they cast her aside, she did what any Harkness would do.</p><p> </p><p>She took.</p><p> </p><p>She stole one of her mother’s spell books in a hurry, the first one her fingers landed on. It seemed Fate had guided her to the wrong book. By the time she realized what she had taken, it was too late. Not that it would have stopped her. Agatha had never been one to fear the things others told her to fear (That was Evanora’s doing, too).</p><p> </p><p>The first time she saw Rio, Agatha was locked in her bedroom. It wasn’t unusual- Evanora made a habit of it. The door was bolted. The window, sealed with magic. But outside, beyond the glass, she saw her. A woman standing in the dark, her torch casting an eerie green glow.</p><p> </p><p>She should have questioned it but she was too distracted by how alive she suddenly felt looking at her. It wasn’t fear. It wasn’t dread. <br/><br/></p><p>It was exhilarating.</p><p> </p><p>She turned away from the window and got to work.</p><p> </p><p>But the woman kept appearing.</p><p> </p><p>She saw her in the market, in the woods, just beyond the edge of her vision. And every night, without fail, standing at a distance from her window. Watching. Waiting. Never speaking. Never getting any closer. Just there.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was a freak. She basically stalked Agatha. She hovered like a ghost, watching her every move, always lingering just far enough away that it couldn’t be called an encounter but never far enough to be coincidence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her. Encouraged her, even.</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt like something not to be played with. The kind of thing most would know better than to touch, to test, to provoke. A force that demanded trepidation, not recklessness.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had always liked to play with things she shouldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>The kind of things that came with warnings, the kind people handled with care or avoided altogether. She liked testing limits, pressing her fingers against the edges of something dangerous just to see if it would cut. And Rio- silent, lingering in the dark like a challenge Agatha was meant to take- seemed like the perfect thing to toy with.</p><p> </p><p>Oh how Agatha wanted to fucking play.</p><p> </p><p>So if, one night, she positioned herself just right- angled toward the window, fully aware of who was watching- and let her hands wander, let herself unravel under the gaze of a woman she had yet to exchange a single word with…</p><p> </p><p>Well, what was life without a little theatrics?</p><p> </p><p>They spoke for the first time the night Agatha killed her coven.</p><p> </p><p>She had pried her mother’s locket from Evanora’s throat, let it dangle between her fingers as she stood amidst the bodies of the women who had tried to unmake her. And when Rio finally stepped forward, emerging from the shadows, she didn’t ask why.</p><p> </p><p>Rio only asked, ‘<em>Do you fear Death?’</em></p><p> </p><p>
<em>Agatha’s eyes flicked over the bodies, the quiet she had orchestrated so effortlessly. She didn’t answer right away. Instead, a satisfied smirk pulled at her lips as she finally met Rio’s gaze.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>“I prefer to think of us as colleagues.”</em>
</p><p> </p><p>And what was business without a little pleasure?</p><p> </p><p>That night, they tore through her mother’s house, colliding with the kind of fury that felt like worship. It wasn’t gentle. It wasn’t sweet. It was sharp and biting, a desperate, reckless thing, tangled in hunger and rage, in everything Agatha had never been allowed to say out loud.</p><p> </p><p>That night, for the first time in her life, Agatha felt like she had won.</p><p> </p><p>But that was all beside the point. What mattered was that Rio had seen, firsthand, what Evanora’s cruelty had done to Agatha. What it had unleashed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t trying to compare Rio to her mother- Rio was nothing like Evanora. But that didn’t change the fact that her words had struck something buried but never forgotten. They had landed in a place Agatha preferred to keep untouched, too close to echoes of a past she had spent lifetimes trying to outrun.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio knew that.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had walked into this room with the intention of not hurting Rio. She had done it too many times before, lashed out in ways she could never take back.</p><p> </p><p>She had walked into this room in some desperate attempt to keep them all from breaking. But Rio had been reckless with her words. And Agatha, who had let her mommy issues get the better of her more times than she cared to admit, had run with it.</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, her original intent went straight to hell, took a seat right next to Evanora Harkness, and poured itself a drink.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw the exact moment her words landed. The way Rio’s face twisted. First disgust, then heartbreak, then regret. Her mouth opened and closed, searching for words, for some way to take it all back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped forward, reaching out. “No. That is not what I mea-”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was already moving, already stepping back, already flinching at her touch before Rio could even finish the sentence.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand hovered between them for only a second before she yanked it back, pressing it against her chest like she had been struck. Her brown eyes, wide and wounded, searched Agatha’s face, but whatever she was looking for wasn’t there.</p><p> </p><p>And it broke Rio. More than the words, more than the accusations, it was this… this unspoken confirmation that she had become something Agatha wanted to keep at a distance.. again, but for different a reason. Agatha saw the moment Rio crumbled, the way she curled inward as if trying to make herself smaller, and it shattered Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to reach out, to close the space between them, to tell Rio she was wrong. That it wasn’t fear, not for a second. Agatha was just fucking furious. But she forced herself to stay still. She had to remain firm. Even when it hurt.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t get to stop being her mother just because you’re hurt,” Agatha said, voice steady. “Take it from an expert. Your words to her matter. And don’t act surprised when you eventually figure out that they stuck.”</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t yelling. She didn’t need to. This wasn’t a fight. This was fact. Fact that she spoke from experience. Too much of it, honestly. But that was what happened when your mother was the blueprint for every worst case scenario.</p><p> </p><p>Rio clenched her hands into fists at her sides, as if forcing herself not to reach for Agatha. “I’m-” She sucked in a sharp breath, chest rising like she was trying to hold herself together. When she spoke again, the words rushed out.</p><p> </p><p>“I meant that it wasn’t happening. I still mean that. But I didn’t…” She exhaled shakily. “She lied to me,” Rio’s teeth clenched around the words, rigid with barely restrained anger.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her jaw tighten, her fingers twitch like she needed to lash out. The frustration boiled, rising fast, but then it broke, draining from her like a wave pulling back into the ocean.</p><p> </p><p>The fight was gone. The words fell from her lips in a whisper, sad and aching, “She’s never lied to me before.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was certain Sage hadn’t outright lied to Rio. Not technically. Their daughter had likely just omitted the truth. It was still wrong, still frustrating, but it didn’t justify the way Rio had reacted. And even if Sage had lied, it still didn’t warrant that. Nothing did.</p><p> </p><p>“How you responded was worse,” Agatha said without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s resolve must have struck a nerve because Rio took a step back, widening the space between them. Her arms crossed over her chest, not in defiance, but in defense.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had known her too long, had studied every nuance of her body language, and she caught the moment Rio’s arms crossed over her chest. A small movement, instinctive, but Agatha understood it for what it was.</p><p> </p><p>A habit carved into her over centuries.</p><p> </p><p>Rio always covered her heart, always shielded it, as if bracing for a blow. Rio had spent lifetimes learning how to protect it- not from enemies, not from the natural order of things, but from the one person she loved. From the one who could hurt her the most.</p><p> </p><p>She had never needed that kind of armor before Agatha. Before love had made her vulnerable in ways she had never expected, in ways that no force of nature, no act of violence, had ever managed to. The world could not break Rio, but Agatha could. And she had. Over and over again.</p><p> </p><p>So she had learned. Learned to guard what was fragile. Death had a heart, and after Agatha, Rio had never stopped trying to keep it from breaking.</p><p> </p><p>Not from the expectation of cruelty, not the bracing for words meant to wound. It was fear, the kind that settled deep and festered. The kind that came from knowing what it meant to be left behind.</p><p> </p><p>Like before.</p><p> </p><p>Like when Agatha had made the choice for her. When, without hesitation, without discussion, she had decided that Nicholas was not Rio’s to claim. That she wasn’t his mother. That her grief didn’t matter, that her love wasn’t enough. Agatha had walked away, had taken that life with her, and left Rio standing in the ruins of what could have been.</p><p> </p><p>And to be very fucking clear, that would not happen again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t hold onto her anger anymore. It crumbled the moment she saw Rio cross her arms and the way Rio looked like she had destroyed the only thing that mattered. Like she was already bracing for the loneliness that would follow, certain she had no one left in her corner.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped forward and gently pulled Rio’s arms apart. Rio shook her head, blinking hard against the tears threatening to fall, like she didn’t deserve the comfort. She tried to pull away, to cross her arms over her chest again, but there was no real fight in it. And Agatha didn’t let her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio melted the moment Agatha pulled her in, pressing their bodies together. Her arms wrapped around Agatha’s waist in an instant, hands gripping the fabric at her lower back, fingers curling into fists like letting go wasn’t an option.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand slid to the nape of Rio’s neck, and immediately, Rio’s fingers shot up to grasp her wrist. Holding her there. Grounding herself. Reaffirming the touch. As if she needed proof that Agatha was real, that she hadn’t already lost her.</p><p> </p><p>It was gut wrenching, seeing Rio like this. Heartbroken. Desperate to undo the damage she believed was hers to bear completely alone.</p><p> </p><p>“My love,” Agatha murmured, voice low and soothing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes were clenched shut, her breathing uneven, but Agatha didn’t pull away. She let her other hand drift up Rio’s body, stopping over her heart, pressing her palm flat against it. A reminder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t needed proof that Death had a heart. She had known now. Had embraced it fully. But Rio needed to be reminded. Reminded that Agatha understood exactly what she held in her hands. That she wasn’t careless with it, not anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes squeezed shut even tighter as her head dropped to rest against Agatha’s. Her other hand lifted, covering Agatha’s where it lay over her heart.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” The word tore from her in a breathless, broken cry. Like it hurt. Like she had been drowning, and this was her first gasp of air, but her lungs weren’t ready to hold it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the frantic pound of Rio’s heart against her palm, each beat rattling through her fingers. She watched as Rio exhaled a shaky, uneven breath, one that barely held itself together.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean-   I didn’t… I can’t fucking-  I don’t want her to be scared of me.” Rio’s voice was fractured, words tripping over each other, untangling into a mess she couldn’t contain. Her whole body shook with it, like holding everything inside had become excruciating. “I fucked it up and…” Another breath, sharp and painful. “I don’t know how to fix it. I can’t give her what she wants.” The confession burst out of her, unfiltered. A hiccuped sob punctuated the words, like they hurt coming out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to soothe her, murmuring soft reassurances, but Rio only shook her head, the fight still tangled in her chest. “You don’t understand… I don’t want to see her.” The words came out in a broken whimper, her breath shuddering. “I can’t see her.”</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t avoidance. It wasn’t anger. It was heavier. Agatha knew it wasn’t about what Sage had done, but what Rio had said. She couldn’t face her daughter, not after this. Rio was at war with herself, Trapped between the eternity she had sworn to and the daughter who had never asked for it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. She pulled Rio in, guiding her head to rest against her shoulder, her fingers cradling the back of her head while their joined hands remained pressed between them, still resting over Rio’s heart.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, you need to breathe,” Agatha whispered gently. “For me… please.”</p><p> </p><p>And because it was Agatha, Rio did. It took time. The minutes stretched between them, Agatha holding her close, feeling the unsteady rhythm of her heart beneath her palm. It was still fast, still frantic, but no longer spiraling out of control.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally spoke, it was barely more than a breath against Rio’s ear. “I love you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t answer. Agatha felt the way her heartbeat slowed, settling under her touch. And if Rio were anyone other than Lady Death, she might have been concerned by how still it had become.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m so fucking mad at her,” Rio whispered against Agatha’s hair, her body tensing, hands tightening as if bracing for impact. As if saying it aloud might make Agatha pull away.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha held her just as tight. “I know,” she whispered back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hesitated before finally pulling away, just enough for Agatha to see her face for the first time in what felt like ages. She took the hand that had been cradling Rio’s head and tucked a stray piece of hair behind her ear, anything to get a clearer view.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Agatha murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed as she shook her head. “You don’t have anything to apologize for.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha only shrugged, the hand trapped between them gripping Rio’s shirt as best as it could with Rio’s own still firmly covering it.</p><p> </p><p>Who the hell would believe Agatha Harkness would apologize just to make someone feel better? Certainly not her. And if the bones in her grave could roll over, she’d bet every last one of them just did. But Agatha didn’t mind. Not this time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio whispered, “I’m not ready to go back. Not yet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded immediately, “That’s okay.” The words left her in a rush, making sure Rio didn’t spiral again. “That’s okay. Stay here a little longer. I’ll go check on Sage.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave a small nod and moved to pull away, but Agatha didn’t let her go just yet. Her grip tightened, just enough to keep her there.</p><p> </p><p>“Just a second longer, yeah?” Agatha’s voice was quiet, pleading. She just needed to look at her wife a little longer. Hold her a little longer. To feel her close, to breathe her in, to remind herself that she was here.</p><p> </p><p>So much had happened in mere moments, but the ache of missing her had settled deep, like Rio had been gone for centuries.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know how she had done it before. How she had gone so long without looking at Rio, without holding her. Now, the thought alone felt unbearable, like a kind of deprivation she wouldn’t survive a second time.</p><p> </p><p>She let her hand drift from Rio’s chest to her cheek, her thumb brushing along her jaw. Now both hands cradled her face, keeping her close, keeping her still. Agatha took her in, every line, every detail, committing it to memory like she hadn’t already spent lifetimes memorizing her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice broke the quiet. “You’ll stay in our room with me when I get home? No more spare bedroom?” She didn’t look away, didn’t let Agatha escape her gaze. Her brown eyes begged, “Please.”</p><p> </p><p>There was never a question. Agatha nodded. “Of course.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha traced the swell of Rio’s bottom lip with her thumb, her breath catching at the urge pulling at her. She didn’t fight it. She tugged Rio closer, eyes dropping to her lips before she closed the gap.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. She met Agatha’s kiss with softness, lips pressing together like she wanted to savor it. But it didn’t stay gentle for long.</p><p> </p><p>The moment Agatha felt Rio’s tongue swipe against her lip, seeking entrance, she parted her mouth willingly. Rio deepened the kiss, tilting her head, claiming every inch with no intention of stopping, of holding back. Agatha melted into it, tilting her own head to give Rio all the access she wanted.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio’s tongue dragged across the full expanse of her mouth, like she couldn’t get enough, like she needed to taste every inch of her, and it sent a shiver straight through Agatha’s spine. She moaned, her hands gripping at Rio, pulling her closer.</p><p> </p><p>The kiss turned desperate, all restraint slipping. Agatha pushed back, meeting Rio’s fervor with her own, her tongue twisting with Rio’s, battling for dominance neither of them actually wanted to win. It wasn’t about winning. It was about the way they tasted, the way they breathed each other in, the way they poured every ounce of love into it to make up for every second lost.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled away first, her breathing uneven. “You should probably go.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded but kissed her one last time, slower this time, lingering before finally pulling back. She found Rio’s eyes, holding them as she spoke, “I love you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I love you too.” No hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stepped back, and with a single nod from Rio, a portal opened. She turned to go, but before Agatha could take a step, Rio’s fingers closed around her wrist, holding her back.</p><p> </p><p>“Promise me you’ll be home when I get back.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even blink, “I promise.” She meant every fucking word.</p><p> </p><p>Rio studied her for a second longer, then gave a small nod and let go.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha stepped through the portal, she was already upstairs, standing directly in front of Sage’s door. Of course, Rio had placed it there- no chance to hesitate, no room to stall. She wanted Agatha to go straight to their daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pushed the door open and was met with a sight that, even for Sage, felt dramatic.</p><p> </p><p>Sage lay sprawled on the floor, face pressed into the carpet, her arms tucked under her chest like she had simply collapsed and decided to stay there. Atop her, Brucie was coiled in a perfect spiral on Sage’s butt, her green body tightening, as if trying to console Sage through sheer force.</p><p> </p><p>Brucie missed her person. That much was obvious. But Sage was too deep in her sulking to acknowledge her, lost in whatever emotional pit she had thrown herself into. The melancholic notes of Clair de Lune drifted through the room from a speaker tucked somewhere out of sight, only adding to the self imposed tragedy of the moment.</p><p> </p><p>Classic Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing a hand over her face. “This is definitely a choice,” she muttered before lowering herself to the floor beside Sage. She sank onto her knees, then onto her stomach, pressing her cheek against the carpet so she could meet her daughter’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>And then- <em>god</em>. It felt like someone had reached into her chest and wrenched her heart out with their bare hands.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was already looking at her, cheek smushed against the carpet, her face blotchy around her eyes and mouth. The green of her irises burned against the redness that surrounded them, swollen and raw from crying. The contrast was jarring, striking in a way that made Agatha’s breath catch.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, lying flat on her stomach felt too restrictive, too suffocating, so Agatha turned fully onto her side, needing to see Sage properly.</p><p> </p><p>“I just wanted to help.” The words were quiet, weighed down with so much sadness that a single tear slipped from the corner of her eye, rolling off the bridge of her nose and disappearing into the carpet.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Jesus Christ.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>The women in Agatha’s life seemed adamant on putting her through hell. It was insufferable. <em>How did they even do this</em>? How did they manage to look so fucking broken, so gut wrenchingly sad, that it made Agatha want to carve her own heart out just to stop the ache.</p><p> </p><p>It was devastating, the kind of sorrow that made her stomach churn. The kind that made Agatha want to burn the world down just to erase the look on their faces.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha thought that being locked in a room with Evanora Harkness, facing all of her wrath, would have been easier than this. She could handle cruelty. She could handle being yelled at, torn apart. But this? Watching her daughter crumble in front of her, watching the heartbreak spill from those too-green eyes? It was fucking excruciating.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, Petal,” Agatha murmured, voice thick with quiet grief. She reached out, tucking a stray piece of hair behind Sage’s ear with the gentlest touch.</p><p> </p><p>Sage flinched at the nickname, and Agatha’s hand jerked back like she had touched an open flame.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t call me that,” Sage whined, her voice thick with emotion. “It reminds me of her.”</p><p> </p><p>A hiccup broke through her words as two more tears slipped down her cheek. She turned her head, pressing her face into the carpet like she wanted to bury herself there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched. Maybe she shouldn’t have been the one to do this. She didn’t know how to comfort Sage, didn’t know what worked and what didn’t, and suddenly, she was paralyzed by the fear of making it worse. Of crossing a line she couldn’t see. Rio should be here. Rio would know what to do. Rio was her mother.</p><p> </p><p>Before the thought could spiral any further, Sage shifted, turning her head back to the side, eyes still closed. “I didn’t mean it like that,” she said softly, like she had felt the turn of Agatha’s thoughts, afraid she had just shoved her away. “Any other time, I’d flame you for being a giant teddy bear, but secretly love that you called me that anyway.” She sniffled, her lips twitching just slightly. “Honestly, it wouldn’t even be a secret. I’d eat it up every time.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, staring at her daughter. Even in the middle of an emotional breakdown, Sage managed to be so herself that it was almost funny. Almost.</p><p> </p><p>Sage let out a long, shaky sigh before opening her eyes, searching Agatha’s face. “Do you really think she hates me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have time to analyze how brutal that sounded, didn’t pause to pick apart the layers of hurt threaded through the question. She answered without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>“She doesn’t hate you. She could never hate you.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t look convinced, “She was going to say it. If you hadn’t stopped her, she would’ve said it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, shaking her head. “Well, she was acting like a steroid raged maniac. She was being an idiot. She didn’t mean it.” She hoped the truth behind her words would land, that Sage would really hear it.</p><p> </p><p>But Sage only shook her head, disbelief still clouding her features. “She was so mean,” she whispered. “She’s… she’s never been mean to me. Not like that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, her fingers instinctively reaching out, smoothing Sage’s hair back from her face again like she could take away some of the weight pressing down on her daughter. “What she said was out of line. No matter how she feels about what you were trying to do, she had no right to take it out on you.” Agatha let the words settle before speaking again, softer this time, “You have every right to be upset. But I promise you, Sage, she loves you more than anything.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s face crumpled, fresh tears spilling over. “I’m really upset with her right now.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know, love.” Agatha didn’t hesitate.</p><p> </p><p>Sage sniffled, rubbing at her eyes, but her mouth twitched in something close to amusement. “You’re making it really hard for me to wallow in my own self pity when you’re being so gay. But I fucking love it, so don’t stop.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but at least Sage wasn’t drowning in devastation anymore. Even if it was only for a moment.</p><p> </p><p>Then Sage’s expression sobered again, “I don’t want to talk to her.” Her voice was firm, like she was bracing for Agatha to push.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s okay,” Agatha assured her. “I wouldn’t either if I were you.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage furrowed her brows, like that answer was wrong, like she had expected a fight and wasn’t sure what to do without one. Her voice dropped to a whisper. “Why are you being so understanding? I know you’re not mad at her anymore, so why aren’t you forcing me to apologize?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated, considering her next words carefully. “Because what she said to you was worse than anything you could’ve done. I know that. She knows that.” She paused, debating if she should say the rest, but the truth was already sitting heavy in her chest. “And… my mommy issues aren’t exactly helping this situation.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage blinked, caught off guard by the admission.</p><p> </p><p>“My mother was a big part of my villain origin story, you know,” Agatha added, a wry smile tugging at her lips, though there was no real humor behind it.</p><p> </p><p>Sage let out a short, breathy laugh, wiping at her face. “I always prefer the villains.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed, narrowing her eyes playfully. “Is that so?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious,” Sage defended, propping herself up slightly. “I read this hot take on Reddit once that said heroes will always choose the world over you, but villains will always choose you over the world. And I fully believe that.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha studied her for a long moment, her lips twitching. “You would get your philosophy from Reddit.”</p><p> </p><p>“I fucking love Reddit. And so did Agnes, you know,” Sage said, completely straight faced.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did know. Unfortunately. But that wasn’t the problem here. “How the hell do you know that?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage smirked. “Westview has an entire subreddit dedicated to its lore, and your comments are still up.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and flipped dramatically onto her back. <em>Of course they were</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s hilarious, actually,” Sage continued. “Most of it is just batshit conspiracy theories about Wanda and what really happened. Magic, scandals, people trying to piece together shit they’ll never understand. Actual, mouthwatering tea.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, “And what was Agnes doing in the middle of all this?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew damn well what had gone on in that subreddit, but she would absolutely never fucking admit that out loud.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, she was all over it,” Sage said, unable to contain her glee. “But not in a cool way. No, she was in full neighborhood watch mode, yelling at people for clogging the subreddit with nonsense because it was drowning out the real issues.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned again, covering her face with both hands. “I don’t even want to know-“</p><p> </p><p>“No, listen,” Sage pressed on, barely holding back laughter. “There’s a whole thread of you arguing with someone about garbage pickup schedules. And another one where you went on a full rant about some guy leaving his Christmas lights up until March.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a slow, suffering exhale.</p><p> </p><p><br/>This might actually be hell.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, and don’t even get me started on the Westview Neighborhood Watch Facebook page,” Sage added. “Because let me tell you- ‘Agnes’ had a lot to say!” Sage grinned and patted her arm. “You’re so nosy. It’s honestly kind of inspiring.”</p><p> </p><p>Okay. Agatha might be borderline homicidal at this point.</p><p> </p><p>Then, as if remembering the best part, Sage’s face lit up. “Oh! Speaking of inspiring.. Mo- .. Rio and I spent an entire night going through your old comments and posts.” This time the name change wasn’t for Agatha’s comfort, it was for Sage. Agatha’s heart twisted uncomfortably in her chest but Sage ignored it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped, “Excuse me?”</p><p> </p><p>“We got so deep into the Agnes archives. Like, full blown research expedition. I swear, it started as a casual scroll, and before we knew it, hours had gone by.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her daughter in horror.</p><p> </p><p>“It was beautiful,” Sage said. “Rio nearly cried laughing when we found your 27 comment argument about ‘unauthorized lawn flamingos.’”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked like she was reconsidering every decision that had led her to this moment.</p><p> </p><p>Sage clapped her hands together. “Anyway. Just thought you should know your legacy lives on.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, “I’m figuring out how to erase both of your memories.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please, as if you could wipe anything from the internet,” Sage said smugly. “Besides, Rio printed the screenshots.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha banged her head back against the carpet multiple times and ended it with a final defeated sigh.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard Sage shift beside her and the faint slide of Brucie slithering off somewhere. A moment later, Sage’s head came to rest against her shoulder. Without thinking, Agatha turned into the touch, pressing her cheek into Sage’s hair. Her heart soared at the affection, the ease of it, the way Sage sought her out without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Though Agatha could feel it creeping in- the way Sage’s mind was sinking back into everything that had happened, the dread slipping in again, threatening to pull Sage under.</p><p> </p><p>She heard Sage sigh. “Will you tell me about you and her?” she asked, voice quiet, hesitant.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “What do you want to know?” She would tell her anything, everything- spill every secret she ever had just to keep her daughter from drowning in this.</p><p> </p><p>“Literally anything,” Sage murmured. “I’ve had a rough day. I deserve to hear some part of my moms’ love story.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage knew so much. Things she hadn’t been present for, details that had to have come from Rio. And yet, doubt curled in Agatha’s chest like an unwelcome guest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had never been one to keep her mouth shut. She was just as nosy as Agatha, if not worse, and she loved stirring the pot just for the fun of it. But had she actually talked about Agatha, or had she left Sage to do all the digging on her own?</p><p> </p><p>The insecurity gnawed at her. She needed an answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh trying to keep her voice even, “Did she ever tell you about me?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage scoffed like the question itself was ridiculous. Like Agatha hadn’t any idea how deeply she had already been woven into her daughter’s life.</p><p> </p><p>“She talked about you constantly,” Sage said, matter of fact, like it wasn’t even up for debate. “She made sure I knew you were my mother.” Her voice softened just slightly, like she needed Agatha to hear her, really hear her. “Why do you think I’m so obsessed with you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother fighting the smile that pulled at her lips, the relief settling deep in her bones.</p><p> </p><p>Sage tilted her head up, a knowing smirk pulling at her lips. “She’s just a brooding loser who couldn’t stomach sharing the romantic parts.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, shaking her head. But the relief settled deep in her chest. Of course Rio had talked about her. There was never a world where she wouldn’t, Rio had been far too obsessed with Agatha not to.</p><p> </p><p>“Now spill!“ Sage demanded, nudging Agatha’s ribs impatiently.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re impatient.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m invested,” Sage corrected. “And you’re holding out on me. Give me something good.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, glancing up at the ceiling as if searching for the right place to begin. There were so many places she could start- so many moments, so many years, so many versions of them.</p><p> </p><p>Then, finally, she settled on a starting point.</p><p> </p><p>“It was a long time ago. I had gotten myself into a bad situation, which I know is shocking.” She waved a lazy hand. “I had been dealing with some arrogant warlock who thought he was untouchable. He was powerful, but not particularly smart, and I was getting bored of the whole thing. Until he stopped playing fair.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s smirk dimmed slightly, but she stayed quiet.</p><p> </p><p>“I was overconfident. I got caught,” Agatha admitted, a little begrudgingly. “I wasn’t expecting him to pull an enchanted blade, and I certainly wasn’t expecting him to use it. And let me tell you, getting stabbed in the stomach is not fun.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage shifted against her, a subtle movement, but Agatha could feel her daughter vibrating with excitement. Before she could interrupt, Agatha kept going.</p><p> </p><p>“I was bleeding out, magic drained to the point of uselessness, and for the first time in a long time, I actually thought, this might be it.”</p><p> </p><p>She tilted her head slightly, a small fond smirk creeping onto her lips. “And then the doors slammed open.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage blinked, clearly invested now.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio walked in, looking like she had just crawled straight out of the hell. Dirt on her clothes, blood smeared across her face, her eyes darker than I had ever seen them. And she wasn’t calm. She wasn’t controlled. She was furious. She saw me on the ground, bleeding, and I swear I felt the entire room shift.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tapped her fingers lightly against the floor. “The warlock sneered at her, told her she was too late. That there was nothing she could do. And I, in my infinite wisdom, thought maybe he was right. I had lost too much blood. I wasn’t getting up from that.”</p><p> </p><p>Her voice softened slightly, her eyes flickering with something unreadable. “Rio didn’t even hesitate. She didn’t speak. She didn’t threaten. She moved. And she tore through him like he was nothing. It was brutal and unforgiving.”</p><p> </p><p>“She was covered in blood- his, hers, mine- and by the time she reached me, I could barely keep my eyes open. She knelt beside me, hands shaking, licked both of them and started pressing down on my wound to heal me, muttering over and over, <em>I got you. You’re fine. I got you</em>.” Agatha inhaled softly. “And I remember looking at her, at this woman who had just torn apart a man with her bare hands, and thinking, oh. Oh, I love her.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage grinned, “So, you fell in love because she was covered in blood and unhinged?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha mumbled, tilting. “I fell in love because she didn’t care what she had to do or what she had to become. As long as it meant she could get to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage melted against her, clutching her chest like she could physically feel it, “Oh my god! That’s so romantic!” She shouted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, rolling her eyes. “Shut up before I rip out your tongue.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, fuck off,” Sage shot back, entirely unbothered. “You were gushing just as much telling that story as I was listening. Now tell me another one. I’m still sad.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, shaking her head, but she didn’t argue. She told her two more stories about Rio being a complete idiot, constantly getting herself into trouble with ridiculous, over the top romantic gestures that should have been endearing but mostly made Agatha want to strangle her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio would be home soon. And when she was, reality would come crashing back down around them. But for now, Agatha would do what she could to hold it off, to make Sage laugh, to make the weight of the day feel a little lighter.</p><p> </p><p>Even if it meant choking out every unbearably sappy memory like it didn’t make her want to gag.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha stayed with Sage, even when she heard the front door close downstairs. Sage startled, just a small, barely noticeable jerk, but Agatha felt it, the slight tension rippling through her daughter’s body. It twisted something uncomfortably in her chest, but she remained by Sage’s side a little longer, even as the urge to go to Rio pulled at her. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">When Sage finally shooed her away, Agatha didn’t argue. In truth, she had to stop herself from leaving too quickly.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">At the bedroom door, their bedroom door, she didn’t bother knocking. The moment she stepped inside, Rio was already moving, crashing into her with enough force to send her stumbling back. Agatha barely had time to react before her arms were wrapping around Rio on instinct, holding her close. A breathy laugh escaped her as she buried her face in Rio’s hair, her wife’s warmth melting into her own.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio was the first to pull away, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear as her gaze dropped to the floor. A faint blush crept up her cheeks, like she was embarrassed by the intensity of her own actions. She hesitated before looking up at Agatha, a silent question in her eyes.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“She’s okay. Dramatic as always,” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio gave a small nod but didn’t lift her head.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha dipped her own, trying to catch Rio’s eyes. “She’s still upset with you, but she’s okay.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Another nod, slower this time, as Rio let the words settle.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio took a sharp breath before snapping her head toward Agatha. “Can we talk about literally anything else? Or do anything else? Just… please?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha understood. Honestly, she felt the same. The day had been heavy, bone crushingly so. She wanted a break just as much as Rio did.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha nodded, “Anything in particular you have in mind?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t answer right away. She just looked at Agatha, really looked at her, with an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha had a feeling where this was going. The shift in Rio’s expression made it clear. Her gaze dropped to Agatha’s lips, her eyes dark and half lidded, her breath slowing as if she were making a decision. When she finally spoke, her voice was quiet, “A few things, actually.” Rio nodded slightly, then dragged her eyes back up to meet Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha recognized that look. The day had shaken Rio, left her unmoored, grasping for something to anchor herself. But this time was different. Rio wasn’t searching for the escape she usually craved.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Most of the time, Rio wanted to forget that she was something people feared. She wanted to lose herself in Agatha, to let go of the burden of what she was, to be nothing more than hands grasping, lips searching, breath hitching. With Agatha, she didn’t have to be Death, didn’t have to be the thing that sent men to their knees in terror. She could just </span> <span class="s2">be</span> <span class="s1">- small, human, </span> <span class="s2">hers</span><span class="s1">.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">But tonight she didn’t want to be taken apart, didn’t want to be undone by Agatha’s hands. Rio wanted to claim, to remind herself of the power she carried, the power Agatha had never feared. Rio wanted Agatha at her mercy, stripped of control, laid bare beneath her. She wanted to take, to own, to leave no doubt that Agatha belonged to her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio was Death, and tonight, she wanted Agatha on her knees like a disciple before a god.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The realization struck Agatha deep, igniting a slow burn in her chest. Without looking away from Rio, she reached back and shut the bedroom door, locking it with a quiet click. “Is this room soundproof or…” She let the words trail off, her meaning unmistakable.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">It needed to be. Agatha had never been quiet, and she wasn’t about to start now. She had no interest in subjecting Sage to </span> <span class="s2">this</span> <span class="s1"> of all things. The girl was grown, but there were some things a child- no matter how old- should never have to hear. And Agatha had every intention of filling this room with the kind of filth that would make even the dead blush.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio only nodded. The simple motion carried more weight than it should have, settling between them like an unspoken challenge.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha exhaled slowly, trying to ease the tension that had wrapped itself around them, thick and electric. It was strange, this sudden quiet, the way neither of them spoke, yet everything between them felt charged. She had always been quick with words, always had something sharp on her tongue, but now, standing here with Rio staring back at her, she found herself at a loss.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">There was something in Rio’s eyes that held her still, something unreadable yet familiar, something that sent a slow, chilling shiver down Agatha’s spine. The air between them felt heavier, as if they were both waiting for the other to make the first move, to close the space, to finally break the silence that had never felt this loud before.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio reached out, her fingers grazing Agatha’s cheek before sliding down to cup her jaw. With a slow, gentle pull, she brought Agatha forward, closing the distance until their bodies pressed together.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a quiet gasp at the contact, warmth curling through her like a slow burn. She didn’t need a mirror to know how she must look, already fucking wrecked before Rio had even kissed her. Her eyes were heavy, her breath uneven, her focus locked on Rio’s lips as if nothing else in the world existed.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio took her time, dragging her hand along the sharp line of Agatha’s jaw, her touch firm but careful. Her thumb skimmed over Agatha’s skin, slow and searching, like she was committing every inch to memory. She was watching, not rushing, waiting for something. Waiting for Agatha to break first.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha leaned in, ready to close the last inch between them, but Rio stopped her. A firm hand held her back, kept her right where Rio wanted her. Agatha’s mind barely registered the resistance, too hazy with need to question it. The only thing that slipped past her lips was a soft, impatient whine.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s fingers curled under her chin, tilting it up with the kind of patience that felt like a test. Agatha didn’t hesitate. She lifted her gaze without being asked twice.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">When blue met brown, the space between them tightened, charged with something thick and suffocating. Rio’s gaze was heavy, dragging over Agatha like she was already deciding how best to take her apart. There was hunger there, deep and unapologetic, the kind that did not ask but claimed.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt it like a slow pull beneath her skin, something ancient, something inevitable. She would not fight it. She would let Rio have her, piece by piece, until nothing remained untouched. She would kneel, bare her throat, and offer herself up like a prayer sent to a god that did not forgive.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio was the first to break the silence, her voice slow and dripping with something dark, </span> <span class="s2">“Can you be good for me?”</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The words hit Agatha like a spark to dry kindling. A desperate, needy sound slipped from her lips before she could stop it. She nodded, too eager, too willing, already moving to kiss Rio again.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">But Rio wasn’t done playing with her yet. She pulled back just enough to stay out of reach, pressing a thumb against Agatha’s lips, stopping her in her tracks.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s smirk was lazy and pleased, like she was savoring every second of Agatha’s desperation. She could feel it, see it in the way Agatha practically trembled with need, her hunger impossible to hide.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She waited, patient and in control, until Agatha’s eyes locked with hers. Only then did she press her thumb harder against her lips, a silent demand. She dragged it down slowly, tracing the soft curve of her bottom lip before pausing just at the edge, teasing.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha parted her lips without hesitation, her tongue slipping out in quiet invitation. Rio hummed in approval before running her thumb along its length, taking her time, drawing it out before finally pressing it into Agatha’s mouth. She let it rest there, testing, waiting, watching the way Agatha took it without question.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha closed her lips around Rio’s thumb, taking it into her mouth with slow intent. Her eyes never left Rio’s, locked in place as she let her cheeks hollow around the intrusion. She dragged her tongue along the length, taking it down to the knuckle before pulling back, only to do it again, keeping the pace unhurried, teasing. Agatha moaned around Rio’s thumb, never looking away. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio pulled her thumb from Agatha’s mouth, the slick drag ending with a soft pop. Her hand slid to Agatha’s cheek, fingers pressing firmly against her skin as she pulled her in.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Their mouths crashed together, hot and desperate, Rio’s lips parting the second they met. She kissed Agatha like she had been starving for her, like every second spent apart had been unbearable. Her tongue slid past her lips, claiming her without hesitation, deepening the kiss before Agatha had a chance to catch her breath.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha parted her lips, letting Rio take exactly what she wanted, giving herself over without hesitation. When she buried her fingers in Rio’s hair and pulled her closer, it wasn’t for control- it was an invitation. A silent offering, a deliberate act of surrender. Agatha was letting Rio take every ounce of who she was, and make it hers. Agatha tilted her head, exposing more of herself, giving Rio complete access, inviting her </span> <span class="s2">in.</span> <span class="s1"> There was no resistance. Tonight, Agatha was </span> <span class="s2">hers</span> <span class="s1">, and Rio didn’t have to ask. She only had to </span> <span class="s2">take.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Then, in an instant, Rio was gone. Agatha barely had time to react before she was left chasing her lips, a loud whine spilling from her mouth, raw with need. But Rio didn’t stop. She tore herself away, turning sharply until her back was to Agatha, as if putting space between them was the only way to keep from losing herself completely.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Her hand dragged down her face, rough and restless, a grunt escaping her like she was trying to shake something off. She stood there, shoulders rising and falling with uneven breaths, like she had already taken everything Agatha had to give. Like she had drained every last ounce of her, consumed her completely, and there was nothing left. The fight was over, the struggle meaningless. They had spent too long pretending this was a game when both of them knew there had never been a winner.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">But then Rio straightened, squaring her shoulders, fingers flexing at her sides. Agatha could see it in the way she held herself, the way her chin lifted just slightly, like she was trying to remind herself of exactly who she was. </span> <span class="s2">Not just Rio. Not just a woman. But Death herself.</span> <span class="s1"> A force that did not beg, did not falter, did not kneel.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t push, not yet. She let Rio have the space to pull herself together, to find her footing again. She knew Rio wanted to figure it out on her own, and stepping in now would only make her dig her heels in deeper.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio disappeared into the closet, the sound of her rummaging through drawers filled the silence. When she returned, she didn’t say a word. She simply lifted a hand and pointed to the edge of the bed, making it clear exactly where she wanted Agatha to stand.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">It took everything in Agatha not to move too fast, not to throw herself into place like she had been waiting for the command. Instead, she pushed herself off the door and walked toward the bed, stopping exactly where Rio had wordlessly instructed. When she turned to face Rio, something heavy dropped to the floor with a soft clunk. Agatha’s gaze followed the sound, landing on a black silk bag at Rio’s feet. The sight alone sent a thrill through her, excitement curling low in her stomach. She knew exactly what was inside. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio was leaning against the dresser, arms crossed, eyes unreadable. The glow of the television flickered behind her, casting shifting light across her face, but Agatha wasn’t looking at the screen.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She was looking at Rio. And waiting.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha watched as Rio’s gaze swept over her, slow and measured, lingering just long enough to make her pulse spike. She didn’t have to say a word. Agatha already knew- Rio wanted her to undress, wanted to watch every layer fall away, wanted to take her in. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">From the very first moment Agatha had laid eyes on Rio, she had known. She wasn’t just someone who enjoyed control, she was someone who thrived on denial, on dragging out the inevitable until it became its own kind of torment. Watching. Waiting. Holding back until the hunger twisted into something unbearable. It wasn’t patience, not really. It was discipline, the kind that turned restraint into a slow, exquisite form of torture.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She wanted the moment to last, to pull it tight, to stretch it so thin that by the time she finally took, the impact would be devastating. The longer she waited, the sweeter the ruin.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">So Agatha undressed.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Her fingers found the hem of her shirt first, pulling it over her head with deliberate slowness, letting the fabric slide from her skin before it hit the floor. Her pants followed, unbuttoned with practiced ease, pushed past her hips until they pooled at her feet. She stepped out of them carefully, her movements unrushed, as if she wasn’t already burning from the inside out.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">When she finally stood there, stripped down to nothing but deep forest green lace, she barely registered the shift in Rio’s gaze. Agatha glanced down at herself, a flicker of realization creeping in. She didn’t remember putting this on earlier. It should have been a question, something to stop and think about.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">But with the way Rio was looking at her, eyes dark and hungry, Agatha decided she didn’t care.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio picked up the bag and closed the distance between them, pressing it firmly into Agatha’s hands. She didn’t break eye contact, her voice unwavering as she spoke.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Put it on me.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha barely managed a nod before sinking to her knees, the movement instinctive, effortless. The bag was set aside, forgotten for the moment as her trembling fingers reached for Rio’s jeans. She worked the button open, then dragged the zipper down. Hooking her fingers into the waistband, she tugged both her jeans and underwear down in one smooth motion.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio pulled her shirt over her head and let it drop to the floor, revealing bare skin beneath. Agatha’s breath hitched, a quiet moan slipping from her lips before she could stop it. She had seen Rio like this countless times, but it never failed to knock the air from her lungs.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Forcing herself to focus, Agatha reached for the silk bag beside her and pulled out the harness. Her fingers moved with careful precision as she adjusted the straps, making sure each buckle was secure before fastening it around Rio’s hips. The leather molded against her skin, fitting her perfectly, like it had been made just for her. Agatha took her time, smoothing her hands along the straps, adjusting them until they sat just right, savoring every second of the task.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">When she was finished, Agatha lifted her gaze, looking up at Rio like she was something divine, something untouchable yet right in front of her, hers to worship.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She took in every inch of her, the way the dim light traced the curves of her body, the way she stood above her, steady and commanding. The sight alone sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine, not from fear, but from awe, from the sheer presence Rio carried without effort.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Her breath was uneven as she drank her in, unable to stop herself from lingering on every detail- the sharpness of her collarbones, the smooth plane of her stomach, the way the harness sat against her hips like it had always belonged there. But it was her eyes that held Agatha in place, dark and filled with something unreadable, something that sent heat pooling deep in her stomach.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha had never believed in god, never put faith in anything she could not see or touch. But kneeling here, looking up at Rio, she thought-</span> <span class="s3"> if anything could be worship, it was </span> <span class="s4">this.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s hand slid against Agatha’s throat, fingers pressing just enough to make her shiver. The contact alone sent a moan spilling from Agatha’s lips, her body reacting before her mind could catch up. Her left hand flew to Rio’s wrist to urge her closer, to press her deeper into her skin.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha used that hand on purpose, the cool weight of the diamond on her ring finger catching the light. A silent reminder. A claim, a vow, a truth that had never changed- </span> <span class="s2">Agatha belonged to her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s breath stuttered, her eyes locking onto the ring like it was a brand seared into Agatha’s skin.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt it, the shift in the air, the way Rio’s grip on her neck tightened for just a moment before easing, like she was caught between wanting to break her and falling to her knees in front of her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A slow, wicked smile tugged at Agatha’s lips as she tilted her head, her voice smooth, laced with mockery and dark amusement. Cruel in the way she knew Rio would crave, sweet in the way that made it worse. “Oh? Has Death had enough already?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio let out a low, humorless laugh, her grip tightening just enough to make Agatha’s breath catch. Her eyes burned with something dark, something restless, something barely restrained. She leaned in slightly, her voice nothing more than a rough command.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Put your mouth on my cock, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A moan spilled from Agatha’s lips, her eyes fluttering shut, rolling back as the words washed over her. If she weren’t already on her knees, she was sure her legs would have given out beneath her. Heat coiled deep in her stomach, a slow, aching pulse, and she could feel the soaked lace between her thighs, already ruined.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio’s hand slid to the back of her head, fingers weaving through her hair, firm but unhurried. She </span> <span class="s2">urged</span> <span class="s1">Agatha forward, a clear expectation in the way she held her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha didn’t resist. She let herself be pulled in, let Rio guide her exactly where she wanted her. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha parted her lips, taking the tip of the shaft into her mouth, her tongue swirling over the smooth length with slow, deliberate strokes. She kept her eyes locked on Rio, watching the way her chest rose and fell, the way her lips parted just slightly as she exhaled.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio’s fingers flexed in her hair, her grip tightening as she urged Agatha forward, pushing her to take more. Not rough, not impatient- </span> <span class="s2">expectant.</span> <span class="s1"> Like she already knew Agatha would obey, knew she would take everything she was given.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">And like the pathetic fool she was, Agatha complied without hesitation. She took Rio’s full length into her mouth, inch by inch, until she could feel the thick weight of it pressing against the back of her throat. Her eyes burned with the threat of tears, but she didn’t stop, didn’t pull away. Instead, she </span> <span class="s2">gave.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She dragged herself back, lips stretched, cheeks hollowed, her tongue slicking along the length as she pulled away just enough to breathe before sinking back down. The motion was steady, deliberate, each stroke more desperate than the last. She wanted Rio to feel it, to feel how eagerly she took her, how much she craved every inch.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Above her, Rio let out a moan, deep and unrestrained, the sound vibrating through Agatha’s chest, through her core, through every nerve set alight with need. A muffled whimper escaped her, swallowed by the very thing she was so eager to worship. But Rio </span> <span class="s2">heard</span> <span class="s1"> it. She </span> <span class="s2">felt</span> <span class="s1"> it. And that only made her grip in Agatha’s hair tighten, her hips rolling forward, demanding everything Agatha was already so willing to give.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio pulled her back, fingers tightening in her hair as she tilted Agatha’s head up, forcing her to meet her gaze. Her eyes were nearly black, heavy with something dark and consuming, her breath uneven, her smirk lazy and dripping with satisfaction. Her tongue flicked over her bottom lip as if she were already tasting victory.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Do you fear Death?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s lips parted, a breathless laugh slipping through as she let herself settle into Rio’s grip, pressing into the hold that still kept her exactly where she belonged.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“No. I’m Her’s to take.” </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">It must have been the right answer because, in the next breath, Rio was pulling her up with effortless strength, spinning her around until her back met the firm heat of Rio’s chest. The sudden shift sent a rush through Agatha, Rio pressing against her, the thick length of her cock pushing firmly against the curve of her ass. A gasp left Agatha’s lips, swallowed quickly by a moan she had no interest in suppressing.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s arm locked around her waist, holding her exactly where she wanted her. Her other hand slid up, fingers threading through Agatha’s hair, gathering it and sweeping it aside in one motion. Then she leaned in, her mouth pressing to the newly exposed skin.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Her lips moved along Agatha’s neck, heat trailing in their wake. She kissed like she meant to leave a mark, slow and consuming, her tongue flicking over the spot just before her teeth scraped against it. Each press of her mouth sent a pulse of heat through Agatha, sinking into her like an unspoken promise.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">As her lips traveled lower, so did her hand. Fingers traced the lace of Agatha’s bra, lingering for just a moment before expertly finding the clasp. With practice ease, she unhooked it. Then without hesitation, Rio grabbed the fabric at the center of her chest, her grip firm as she pulled it away from Agatha’s body. With one fluid motion, she yanked it down her arms and tossed it aside, the discarded fabric forgotten before it even hit the floor.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The sudden cool air sent a shiver through her, but it was nothing compared to the feeling of Rio’s bare chest pressing against her back. The heat, the skin to skin contact, the sheer possession in the way Rio held her- it sent a moan spilling from Agatha’s lips, her head pressing against Rio’s. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s hands moved over Agatha’s chest, fingers spreading as she palmed her breasts, kneading the soft flesh with a slow, deliberate touch. Her thumbs dragged over her nipples, teasing until they hardened beneath her touch. She rolled them between her fingers, twisting just enough to make Agatha arch against her, her breath stuttering into a moan.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Rio!” Agatha gasped, her voice wrecked, rasping with desperation.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio hummed in response, low and satisfied, before one hand slid down Agatha’s stomach, her fingers tracing along the waistband of her underwear before dipping lower. The first press of her palm between Agatha’s legs sent a sharp jolt through both of them, a shared shock of heat that had </span> <span class="s2">both</span> <span class="s1"> of them moaning.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s was louder, deep and guttural, the sound vibrating against Agatha’s ear. The moment it reached her, Agatha moaned again, her head tilting back against Rio’s shoulder as she melted further into her touch.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“You’re so wet for me,” Rio whispered, her breath hot against Agatha’s skin.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha whimpered, her body trembling under Rio’s hands, barely able to nod. She didn’t need to. The proof was already there, slick against Rio’s fingers, undeniable. Agatha was past words, past thought, caught in the space between pleasure and ruin. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio shoved Agatha’s panties down with one hand, the motion rough and impatient, only managing to get them to her mid thigh before her other hand was pressing between Agatha’s shoulder blades. Rio guided her forward, forcing her chest to the mattress, pinning her exactly where Rio wanted her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha braced herself on her forearms, breath ragged, anticipation twisting deep inside her. The way Rio handled her, the effortless strength, the possession in every movement, sent a wave of heat rippling through her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A shiver ran through her as Rio’s hand traced down the length of her spine, slow and deliberate, before settling on her hips. Fingers dug into her skin, holding her steady, keeping her still when all she wanted to do was move. The sound of Rio adjusting herself sent another jolt through her, her breath catching as she felt the thick press of her cock against her, teasing, just barely there.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha let out a desperate moan, her hips jerking back instinctively, trying to push against her, to take her in, but Rio’s grip tightened, keeping her in place.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Patience, my love,” Rio murmured.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A whimper slipped from Agatha’s lips as Rio slid the tip through the slick heat between her thighs, coating the length in her arousal. Each unhurried stroke sent a wave of frustration curling through her, her body aching for more. She tried again, rolling her hips, grinding against the length of her, but Rio only hummed in approval, still holding back.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Rio,” Agatha gasped, pushing back against her, her voice shaking with desperation. “Please.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha barely recognized the sound of her own voice, raw and pleading, every nerve in her body burning with need. She was past patience, past composure, her mind reduced to a singular, all consuming hunger for Rio to </span> <span class="s2">take</span> <span class="s1"> her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">And Rio did.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The plea had barely left her lips before Rio thrust forward, burying herself </span> <span class="s2">to the hilt</span> <span class="s1"> in one deep, unrelenting stroke. Agatha’s cry shattered the silence, a mix of shock and pleasure ripping through her as she stretched around the sudden, overwhelming fullness.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio didn’t move right away. She held herself there, her grip firm on Agatha’s hips, letting Agatha feel </span> <span class="s2">every inch, every unyielding second of it.</span> <span class="s1"> It was possessive, claiming, like she was making sure Agatha understood exactly who she belonged to. </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha trembled beneath her, breath ragged, body adjusting to the sheer intensity of it. Her fingers curled into the sheets, knuckles white as another moan spilled from her lips</span> <span class="s2"> wracked and desperate. </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Then, without warning, Rio pulled back, dragging nearly all the way out before slamming back in, setting a deep, unrelenting rhythm. Each thrust was precise, controlled, her grip firm on Agatha’s hips as she </span> <span class="s2">drove into her</span><span class="s1">, forcing her to take every inch.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha moaned unabashedly, her body rocking forward with each stroke, only to be pulled back just as hard. The sound of skin meeting skin filled the room, mingling with the breathless gasps and ragged moans spilling from Agatha’s lips. Rio wasn’t gentle. She wasn’t patient. </span> <span class="s2">She took.</span> <span class="s1"> She fucked Agatha like she was making a point, like she was </span> <span class="s2">staking her claim</span><span class="s1">, like she wanted to </span> <span class="s2">own</span> <span class="s1"> every part of her. And Agatha let her. She pushed back into every thrust, meeting her just as desperately, her body burning, her mind blanking out with nothing but </span> <span class="s2">want.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Just as Agatha was teetering on the edge, just as the pleasure coiled impossibly tight inside her, her body primed to </span> <span class="s2">break apart</span> <span class="s1">-Rio pulled out completely.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The shock of it </span> <span class="s2">ripped through her</span> <span class="s1">, the sudden emptiness a cruel, jarring contrast to the overwhelming fullness she had just been drowning in. Her entire body recoiled from the loss, her walls clenching around nothing, the denied release </span> <span class="s2">hitting her like a blow.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A sharp, desperate cry tore from Agatha’s lips before she could stop it.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s2">“No!”</span> <span class="s1"> she shouted, her voice raw, wrecked, pleading without shame. She </span> <span class="s2">jerked forward, then back</span><span class="s1">, instinctively trying to find Rio again, to fix the unbearable absence, but </span> <span class="s2">Rio wasn’t there.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha’s fingers </span> <span class="s2">dug into the sheets</span><span class="s1">, her chest heaving, her skin burning with frustration and need. Her head snapped to the side, her gaze locking onto Rio, wide eyed and </span> <span class="s2">fuming, wrecked, starving</span> <span class="s1"> all at once.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Before Agatha could demand an answer, Rio beat her to it.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Flip over,” her voice was firm, leaving no room for argument. Agatha obeyed, moving quickly, the need still thrumming in her veins, her frustration burning just beneath the surface.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">As soon as Agatha was on her back, Rio grabbed the waistband of her underwear and yanked them the rest of the way off, tossing them aside without a second thought. She didn’t waste time. She climbed over Agatha, settling between her legs, one strong arm wrapping around her waist. With </span> <span class="s2">effortless strength</span> <span class="s1">, she pulled Agatha up the bed, forcing her up the bed. </span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha barely had time to process it before she felt the thick shaft pressing into her stomach, </span> <span class="s2">hot</span> <span class="s1"> and slick. A moan spilled from her lips at the sensation, her thighs squeezing around Rio’s hips, </span> <span class="s2">her body already begging to be taken again.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio planted one hand firmly beside Agatha’s head, her muscles tensing as she hovered over her. With the other, she adjusted herself, the thick length of her cock gliding through Agatha’s slick with slow, teasing precision. She traced agonizing circles against her entrance, never quite pushing in, just enough to </span> <span class="s2">torture.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha moaned, the sound low and desperate, her body arching beneath Rio. Her legs tightened around her waist, pulling her in closer, her heels digging into the small of Rio’s back. She </span> <span class="s2">needed</span> <span class="s1"> this, needed </span> <span class="s2">her</span> <span class="s1">, the unbearable emptiness making her dizzy with frustration.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha rolled her hips up, searching, pleading, </span> <span class="s2">begging</span> <span class="s1"> for Rio to give her what she wanted. “Please stop teasing,” she gasped, her voice rough, breathless, her fingers tangling in Rio’s hair.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio didn’t break eye contact as she pushed back inside, slow and deliberate, stretching Agatha open all over again.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">A sharp gasp tore from Agatha’s lips, her body instinctively reacting to the deep, </span> <span class="s2">achingly slow</span> <span class="s1">intrusion. Her nails scraped lightly against Rio’s scalp.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio took her time, </span> <span class="s2">dragging it out</span><span class="s1">, letting Agatha feel every inch, letting the tension coil tighter with each measured stroke. Agatha melted into it, into </span> <span class="s2">her</span><span class="s1">, body pliant beneath Rio’s, welcoming her, taking her, </span> <span class="s2">wanting all of her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha moaned against Rio’s lips, her fingers tightening in her hair, her body trembling as she gave herself over completely. “Rio,” she gasped, voice breathless, </span> <span class="s2">over taken</span> <span class="s1"> with need. “More.”</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Want to fuck you slow,” Rio murmured, her voice thick with </span> <span class="s2">control</span> <span class="s1"> as she pressed deep into Agatha with slow, measured thrusts.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The words sent a sharp pulse through her, a rush of heat pooling between her legs as her body clenched around Rio, tightening instinctively. A cry tore from her lips, her breath hitching as Rio kept up the </span> <span class="s2">agonizing rhythm,</span><span class="s1"> each deep stroke forcing Agatha’s body to </span> <span class="s2">react</span><span class="s1">, to take every inch. Her back arched, her hands twisting in Rio’s hair, </span> <span class="s2">holding on, surrendering completely.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“I want you to look at me when you come,” Rio said, her voice firm, </span> <span class="s2">unshaken</span><span class="s1">, like she was stating an unbreakable rule.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha barely managed to nod, her breaths coming short, sharp, every nerve in her body burning with the unbearable tension coiling inside her. </span> <span class="s2">This was too much.</span> <span class="s1"> The weight of Rio’s body pressing into her, the intensity in her gaze, the way she </span> <span class="s2">fucked her like she was meant to be here, like she belonged nowhere else.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Fuck,” Agatha gasped, her body tightening, her nails raking against Rio’s scalp. “I love you- oh my god.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Her confession shattered between them just as Rio </span> <span class="s2">pushed deeper, </span><span class="s1">her pace </span> <span class="s2">only slightly faster, only slightly harder</span> <span class="s1">, but enough to send Agatha spiraling.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">And then </span> <span class="s2">one final thrust.</span> <span class="s1"> Deep. </span> <span class="s2">Claiming.</span> <span class="s1"> Holding her there.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The pleasure </span> <span class="s2">hit like a flood.</span> <span class="s1"> Her orgasm crashed over her, stealing her breath, her body clenching down hard as waves of release pulsed through her. A sharp, desperate moan tore from her lips, her body trembling uncontrollably as liquid spilled from her, soaking them both. She barely registered it, too consumed, too overwhelmed, too lost in </span> <span class="s2">everything that was Rio.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The only thing keeping her from falling apart completely was </span> <span class="s2">the warmth of Rio’s body, the steady strength of her hands, and the weight of her eyes- watching, holding, never looking away.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio didn’t stop. She </span> <span class="s2">rode her through it,</span> <span class="s1"> keeping her buried deep inside as Agatha’s body trembled beneath her, every pulse of pleasure rolling through her in uncontrollable waves.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Then Rio’s mouth was on hers.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The kiss was </span> <span class="s2">desperate</span> <span class="s1">, all heat and hunger, as if she needed to taste every sound Agatha made, to claim every last shudder that wracked through her body. Her lips moved against Agatha’s with </span> <span class="s2">purpose</span><span class="s1">, her tongue sweeping inside to </span> <span class="s2">taste, to take, to own.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha was still floating in the aftermath, her limbs loose, her mind hazy with pleasure. She could barely keep up, could barely do anything but moan into Rio’s mouth and </span> <span class="s2">give.</span> <span class="s1"> She parted her lips, letting Rio take what she wanted, letting her deepen the kiss until all she could do was </span> <span class="s2">feel</span> <span class="s1"> her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio kissed her like she wanted to pull her apart all over again, like stopping was never an option. And Agatha- </span> <span class="s2">Agatha let her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio waited until Agatha had come down completely, until the tremors in her body had faded, before she finally pulled out. The loss was instant, sharp in its absence, and a soft whine slipped past Agatha’s lips before she could stop it.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha didn’t move, didn’t even try. She just lay there, body limp, breath still uneven, listening to the quiet rustle of Rio undoing the harness, the soft clatter as she tossed it somewhere carelessly. A moment later, the bed dipped, and then </span> <span class="s2">warmth returned</span> <span class="s1">- Rio </span> <span class="s2">returned</span><span class="s1">, crawling back over her, resting her head against Agatha’s stomach like she belonged there.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">They lay in silence, skin against skin, the heat between them no longer frantic, but </span> <span class="s2">steady, grounding, absolute.</span> <span class="s1"> Agatha’s fingers found their way into Rio’s hair, combing through the strands lazily, tracing the shape of her scalp with the kind of tenderness that only came after being thoroughly </span> <span class="s2">ruined</span><span class="s1">.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha felt </span> <span class="s2">content.</span> <span class="s1"> Sated. Weightless.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio had been an incredible fuck, but it was more than that. Giving herself over- </span> <span class="s2">every part of herself</span> <span class="s1">- to Rio had felt </span> <span class="s2">right.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Later, when the haze of exhaustion finally gave way, Rio took her hand and led her to the bathroom, starting the shower and waiting until the water was warm enough before pulling her inside. The steam curled around them, and as the hot water cascaded over her skin, Agatha let herself </span> <span class="s2">melt</span> <span class="s1"> under the careful press of Rio’s fingers in her hair.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio washed her first, slow and </span> <span class="s2">intentional</span> <span class="s1">, working shampoo through her scalp, nails scratching lightly against her skin, massaging away every lingering bit of tension. Agatha sighed, leaning into the touch, letting Rio take care of her in a way that felt just as intimate as anything they had done before. When it was her turn, Agatha returned the favor, dragging her fingers through Rio’s hair, letting them linger, </span> <span class="s2">savoring the moment.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was filled with quiet laughter, whispered confessions of love, </span> <span class="s2">soft things that made the walls of the day crumble completely.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">And then, </span> <span class="s2">Rio was on her knees.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha barely had time to react before she was </span> <span class="s2">pressed against the shower wall</span> <span class="s1">, her leg thrown over Rio’s shoulder, fingers gripping desperately at slick skin. Her head fell back as </span> <span class="s2">Rio wrecked her all over again</span><span class="s1">, drawing sharp cries from her lips until her voice was hoarse, until she </span> <span class="s2">screamed Rio’s name into the steam.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">By the time they made it back to bed, they were </span> <span class="s2">spent</span><span class="s1">, tangled in each other, limbs entwined, the sheets still smelling like </span> <span class="s2">sex and sweat and them.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio kissed her slow, deep, with </span> <span class="s2">so much love</span> <span class="s1"> that Agatha felt herself </span> <span class="s2">drown in it, welcome it, surrender to it completely.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha let Rio have her. Agatha </span> <span class="s2">wanted</span> <span class="s1"> Rio to have her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">They woke with the sun, warm and tangled together, limbs sluggish with sleep as they slowly peeled themselves from the sheets and got dressed.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha made her way to the kitchen- or at least she tried. </span> <span class="s2">Rio had other plans.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">She latched onto Agatha from behind, arms locked firmly around her waist, her entire body pressing against her like she was trying to </span> <span class="s2">merge them into one person.</span> <span class="s1"> Rio made no effort to walk properly, instead shuffling along awkwardly, </span> <span class="s2">forcing Agatha to drag both of them forward</span> <span class="s1"> with every step.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">It wasn’t really </span> <span class="s2">Agatha</span> <span class="s1"> leading them to the kitchen. It was </span> <span class="s2">Rio clinging to her, making sure they got there together, even if it meant nearly tripping them both in the process.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio’s face was buried in Agatha’s neck, her lips brushing against sensitive skin as she muttered something obscene, her words slurring just enough to sound </span> <span class="s2">half conscious but still entirely sinful.</span> <span class="s1">Between phrases, she left </span> <span class="s2">soft, teasing nips</span><span class="s1">, each one sending little jolts of heat through Agatha, </span> <span class="s2">pulling a breathless laugh from her lips.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“God, you’re unbearable in the mornings,” Agatha said between laughs, swatting at Rio’s arm as they finally reached the kitchen.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“You </span> <span class="s2">love</span> <span class="s1"> it,” Rio murmured against her skin, giving </span> <span class="s2">one last, playful bite</span> <span class="s1"> before Agatha finally pried herself free.</span></p><p class="p2"> </p><p>Agatha turned to face Rio, rolling her eyes but unable to hide the amused smile tugging at her lips, “Make yourself useful and start the coffee.”</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio groaned dramatically, dragging herself toward the coffee maker like she was being </span> <span class="s2">forced into hard labor.</span> <span class="s1"> Agatha leaned against the counter, arms crossed, watching as Rio </span> <span class="s2">tore through the task like a woman scorned</span><span class="s1">, her movements unnecessarily forceful. She yanked open cabinets, slammed the coffee tin onto the counter, and </span> <span class="s2">banged the scoop against the side of the machine like it had personally wronged her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha arched a brow. “Are you fighting the coffee pot or making coffee?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio shot her a pointed glare as she aggressively measured out the grounds. “Wouldn’t have to fight anything if you’d just let me </span> <span class="s2">hold you.</span> <span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha huffed out a laugh, shaking her head. </span> <span class="s2">Her wife was ridiculous.</span> <span class="s1"> And yet, there was something oddly endearing about watching her </span> <span class="s2">throw a tantrum while still making their morning coffee with expert precision.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She watched Rio mutter under her breath, grumbling as she poured the water, her movements unnecessarily forceful. “You are so dramatic.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio slammed the lid shut on the machine and turned to face her, arms crossed. “I think I’m being </span> <span class="s2">very </span> <span class="s1">mature, considering you just ripped me away from the love of my life.”</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before Agatha could respond, a sudden </span> <span class="s2">bang</span> <span class="s1"> echoed from upstairs, shattering the quiet of the morning. Both of them jolted, Rio’s body tensing beside her, her breath catching as her eyes snapped to Agatha.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">For a few long seconds, they stood frozen, waiting. Nothing followed. No footsteps. No Sage storming down the stairs. Just silence.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha exhaled and stepped into Rio’s space, reaching up to gently </span> <span class="s2">push a few strands of hair out of her face.</span> <span class="s1"> Rio’s eyes flickered, still wide with something unspoken, something unsettled.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Without a word, Agatha took her wrists, carefully </span> <span class="s2">uncrossing her arms</span><span class="s1">, easing the tension from them. Rio resisted at first, just for a second, before finally giving in, letting Agatha pull her in.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio wrapped her arms around her waist, burying herself in the warmth of the moment, in the steadiness Agatha offered.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha let her settle before speaking, her voice quiet, careful. “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">She felt the way Rio’s fingers curled against her back, how she held on just a little tighter, how the breath she let out </span> <span class="s2">wasn’t quite steady.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha didn’t push for an answer. She just </span> <span class="s2">held her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“I’m scared,” Rio whispered, voice barely audible. “What if…” She swallowed hard, shaking her head as if forcing the words back down, refusing to let them take shape.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha cupped Rio’s face, thumbs brushing over her cheeks, grounding her. “Just give her time. It’ll be okay,” she murmured, voice steady, reassuring. “She can’t stay mad at you forever.” Agatha offered a small smile, trying to lighten the moment, but Rio didn’t respond. She just stared back, her expression unmoving, unconvinced, saying without a word that yes, Sage absolutely could.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">And then it hit Agatha.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio wasn’t just afraid of Sage holding a grudge. That was part of it, but it wasn’t the whole of it. This morning, the way Rio had clung to her, followed her around, stayed in her space like she couldn’t bear to let go, it wasn’t just about affection. It was about time.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio had been stealing time.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Because once Sage woke up, everything would shift. Agatha wouldn’t be just hers anymore. She would be Sage’s mother, the person Sage would go to for comfort, the one she would vent to, the one who would take her side even against Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">As much as Sage was Rio’s daughter, she was also Agatha’s. And if Sage was anything like her, and she was, then Rio had every reason to be afraid.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Afraid of being shut out. Afraid that Sage would turn to Agatha and leave Rio standing on the outside. Afraid that she would lose Agatha to Sage the way she had lost Agatha before.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha sighed and met Rio’s gaze, voice soft but unwavering, “She won’t stay mad at you forever.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“You don’t know that,” Rio whispered, her voice barely holding together. “I can’t… I can’t wait two hundred years for her to forgive me. It will ruin me, Agatha. I mean it.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio looked like she wanted to say more, but Agatha wouldn’t let her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“That will not happen. I promise you,” Agatha’s voice was unwavering, but she wasn’t sure if Rio even heard her. Agatha needed Rio to hear her, to believe her, but Rio only shook her head, murmuring something about tending the garden as she began to pull away.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha exhaled, frustration curling at the edges of her patience, “Rio.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio stopped mid step. For a moment, she remained still, shoulders tense, fingers twitching at her sides. Then, as if something inside her snapped, she turned sharply, closing the distance between them in an instant.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">She </span> <span class="s2">collided</span> <span class="s1"> with Agatha, pressing their mouths together in a kiss so sudden, so forceful, that it sent her stumbling back a step. Agatha’s hands flew to Rio’s waist, steadying them both, while Rio’s fingers found her face, holding her as if she could </span> <span class="s2">memorize the shape of her through touch alone.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The kiss was deep, </span> <span class="s2">clinging</span><span class="s1">, filled with something heavier than desperation. This wasn’t a plea. It was an act of preservation.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha understood. Rio was </span> <span class="s2">stealing time again</span><span class="s1">, taking what little was left before the day swallowed them whole. Soon, Sage would come downstairs, and Agatha would be a mother first, a wife second. This moment, this closeness, would have to last Rio until nightfall.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha let her have it. She gave her everything she could in this brief, fleeting space between then and now.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">And then, just as suddenly as she had come, Rio pulled away. Her eyes lingered for a second, dark with something unspoken, before she turned and disappeared down the hall.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A beat later, the back door slammed shut.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha inhaled sharply, every muscle in her body tightening at the sheer </span> <span class="s2">inevitability</span> <span class="s1"> of it all. She clenched her jaw, fisted her hands at her sides, and threw her head back before releasing a </span> <span class="s2">silent scream</span> <span class="s1"> into the air.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">It didn’t help.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Letting out a sharp breath, Agatha stormed toward the coffee pot, muttering under her breath, already feeling the weight of the hours ahead.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s1">It was going to be a long fucking day. </span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha finished her coffee on the patio, the sun casting a warm glow over the garden. She had let Señor Scratchy out earlier, and the little traitor was nowhere to be seen, likely trailing behind Rio, </span> <span class="s2">glued to her side as if he had never belonged to anyone else.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Both Rio and Agatha had questioned it. Rio had looked up at the sky, then turned to Agatha with a confused glance, as if searching for an explanation. All Agatha could offer was a shrug. She had none.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Given yesterday’s events, especially with how upset Sage had been, they had both expected a torrential downpour. Yet the sky remained clear, the air still, as if the storm had passed them by entirely.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Neither of them pressed the matter. Some things, it seemed, were better left unanswered.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Not long after, the back door let out a sharp squeak. Both Agatha from her seat and Rio from the garden turned sharply toward the sound, their movements nearly identical in their urgency.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The door cracked open just an inch, hesitating as if considering whether to reveal what lurked behind it. Then, with slow, practiced ease, Brucie slithered through, her smooth vibrant green body slipping past the threshold in a fluid motion. The instant her tail cleared the frame, the door clicked shut, as if orchestrated with intent.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha caught the flicker of disappointment in Rio’s expression the moment Agatha’s eyes landed on the </span> <span class="s2">green witch marking the green serpent.</span> <span class="s1"> It was fleeting, almost imperceptible, but it was there. And it twisted something deep in Agatha’s chest.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha tensed as the snake made a direct path toward the patio- </span> <span class="s2">toward her.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">A pulse of unease coiled in her stomach. In all her time here, she had never witnessed Brucie display anything resembling warmth toward anyone but Sage. For everyone else, she was openly hostile.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">And, of course, the only person she had seen Brucie ever interact with other than Sage was Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio and Brucie had been locked in a </span> <span class="s2">very vocal, very ongoing feud</span> <span class="s1"> since the day Rio had brought her home for Sage. Their mutual disdain had escalated over the years into something </span> <span class="s2">borderline theatrical,</span> <span class="s1"> a long standing war of pettiness and stubborn willpower. Agatha was fairly certain that if Brucie had the ability to flip Rio off, she would have done it </span> <span class="s2">daily.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Those beady red eyes locked onto Agatha with unsettling precision, the weight of her stare calculating, deliberate.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s pulse ticked up as she remained perfectly still, unwilling to make any movement that might be misconstrued as an invitation.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha had no interest in whatever </span> <span class="s2">forbidden fruit</span> <span class="s1"> this serpent intended to offer.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">But as Brucie drew closer, Agatha’s body instinctively shifted into fight or flight mode. Hardly an unusual decision for Agatha Harkness but, </span> <span class="s2">she chose fucking flight.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s feet moved before her mind could catch up, sending her scrambling onto the patio table in a graceless attempt to evade the incoming snake.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Stay back, you overgrown belt,” Agatha snapped, thrusting out a firm hand as if she could ward Brucie off through sheer force of will.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brucie was unimpressed. She reared back, fangs flashing, and </span> <span class="s2">launched herself</span> <span class="s1"> onto the chair Agatha had just been sitting in, hissing loud enough to make it </span> <span class="s2">painfully</span> <span class="s1"> clear that she had taken offense to the name calling.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha barely had time to react before she spun away from the snake, her attempt to flee turning into a full blown disaster as she stumbled off the patio table and crashed into Sage’s usual chair. The sudden shift sent the chair tipping back under her weight, and by some </span> <span class="s2">miraculous</span> <span class="s1"> act of god, Agatha managed to land on her feet- only to immediately stumble forward onto her hands.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The table hit the ground with a deafening </span> <span class="s2">clatter</span> <span class="s1"> as Agatha whipped around, eyes darting wildly, scanning for any sign of Brucie. She pushed herself backward, hands digging into the ground, legs scrambling as she </span> <span class="s2">crawled in reverse,</span> <span class="s1"> desperate to put space between herself and the snake that was </span> <span class="s2">nowhere to be seen.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Then Agatha’s back hit something.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Something solid.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha froze. She looked down. Then up. Then back down.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">“Since when do we have a fucking grill?” Agatha mumbled.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The hiss came before the realization.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s head snapped toward the sound, dread settling deep in her gut.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Brucie was slithering up her leg.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha went completely rigid, every muscle in her body locking up as a string of desperate, </span> <span class="s2">unconvincing</span> <span class="s1"> words tumbled from her mouth.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Heyyyy, hey Brucie… How ya doing?” Her voice wavered as she tried to </span> <span class="s2">casually</span> <span class="s1"> reason with the serpent coiling around her. “I swear I didn’t mean the belt comment. You are a </span> <span class="s2">very</span> <span class="s1"> pretty snake. </span> <span class="s2">Stunning, actually.</span> <span class="s1"> You don’t look like a heinous colored leather belt at all. That was- </span> <span class="s2">that was out of line.</span><span class="s1">”</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Once Brucie reached her thigh, the snake stopped.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha remained still, barely breathing as she noticed a thin, loose string tied around the serpent’s body with a small note attached.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha’s eye twitched, “Fucking Sage.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Moving slowly, with the kind of caution one used around explosives, Agatha reached out. Brucie’s red eyes never left her, unblinking and unreadable. Agatha carefully loosened the string and slipped the note free.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The second the string was removed, Brucie hissed, loud and sharp.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha jolted back, barely stopping herself from falling over, but the snake had already slithered off, vanishing into the garden as if their encounter had never happened.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">She sat there for a moment, letting her heart rate settle before unfolding the note. The message was infuriatingly simple.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s2">‘Living room?’</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha sighed, letting her head </span> <span class="s2">thump</span> <span class="s1"> against the grill before pushing herself off the ground. She lifted the note in the air like a victory flag and called out, “No worries, it was just a note!”</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Brushing off the lingering embarrassment, she turned toward Rio, who was still standing in the exact same spot in the garden, </span> <span class="s2">having witnessed every humiliating second of it.</span> <span class="s1"> Agatha narrowed her eyes.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">“Not like I was facing imminent death or anything,” Agatha added, directing her sarcasm </span> <span class="s2">pointedly</span> <span class="s1"> at her so-called wife.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Rio, who had been utterly </span> <span class="s2">dumbfounded</span> <span class="s1"> just moments ago, finally cracked. The first laugh was quiet, but then she laughed harder, her shoulders shaking as she doubled over slightly.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha huffed, crossing her arms. “Thank you, my knight in shining armor! Your wife is saved, no thanks to you!”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio only laughed harder.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rolling her eyes, Agatha waved the note in the air again, “I’m being summoned to the living room!”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s laughter softened, but the smile lingered, though something in her eyes seemed sad.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">At least Agatha wasn’t leaving her on a worse note. If nothing else, she was glad she had lightened the weight pressing on Rio’s shoulders, even if just for a moment.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha took a few steps toward the door before pausing, glancing back over her shoulder. “I love you.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">It wasn’t a reassurance. It was a reminder. Rio </span> <span class="s2">wasn’t completely alone.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s voice was softer when she responded, but there was certainty in it.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha exhaled, rolling her shoulders and shaking out the tension from the morning. <em>Maybe today wouldn’t be so bad after all.</em></span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">With a swift turn, Agatha flicked her hair over her shoulder and strode inside, preparing herself for whatever awaited her next.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Whatever awaited her next turned out to be reality TV.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha scoffed. Sage and Rio could talk about these shows for hours, dissecting every detail with the kind of passion most reserved for ancient text. Agatha recalled one conversation in particular, an impassioned discussion about a woman named Dorinda Medley.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s3">Rio, with absolute conviction, had declared, “They could never make me hate you, Dorinda Medley.”</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<em> <span class="s3">Sage, without missing a beat, had thrown her hand up and shouted, “CLIP! CLIP! You fool!”</span> </em>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha hadn’t understood a single word of it, but Rio had laughed like it was the funniest thing in the world, so Agatha had decided it wasn’t her battle to fight.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Sage just wanted to watch TV with her.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha could tell she had no interest in being around Rio but was too stubborn to sit alone. Agatha wouldn’t admit it out loud, but it comforted her to know that, at the very least, Sage wanted her company.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Without a word, Sage turned on </span> <span class="s3">Vanderpump Rules</span><span class="s1">, settling in as if this had been the plan all along.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha had lost track of time by the time Sage shifted, resting her head in Agatha’s lap. The sudden affection startled Agatha, but she quickly relaxed, deciding it wasn’t<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>something to question. Instead, her fingers moved absently through her daughter’s hair. </span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Before long, Sage’s breathing deepened into the steady cadence of sleep. Señor Scratchy had nestled comfortably against her legs, and Petunia- Rio’s familiar, or </span> <span class="s3"><em>Tootie</em>,</span> <span class="s1"> as Sage had insisted on calling her-rested contentedly in Sage’s open palm.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha eyed them both, lowering her voice to a quiet whisper, “Traitors.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha had been lost in thought, her head resting against the couch, when she caught movement in her peripheral vision. She lifted her gaze and found Rio standing at the threshold of the living room, watching them.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha straightened, her fingers still idly threading through Sage’s hair, but she said nothing.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">The look in Rio’s eyes made her chest tighten.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Any other time, walking in on this scene- her wife and daughter curled together, Sage resting against Agatha like she had done it a thousand times before- Rio’s heart might have swelled at the sight. It should have been something to cherish.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Instead, for the briefest moment, jealousy flickered across her face.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha understood it instantly. For as long as Sage had been alive, Rio had been the only one Sage turned to for comfort. The only arms she had sought out. Now, for the first time, that had changed.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha watched as Rio shoved that feeling down, burying it beneath the same quiet selflessness she always carried when it came to them. Rio wouldn’t let jealousy take root, not when this was a moment that should have meant something good. Even if Rio had no place in it, she wouldn’t take it from them.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio smiled, small and tired, though it never reached her eyes. “I’m just going to work out in the front.”</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha nodded, pretending not to notice how Sage tensed at the sound of Rio’s voice. Agatha pretended not to feel the tiny shift, the way Sage tried just a little too hard to keep up the act of sleep.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha prayed to whatever god she hoped </span> <span class="s3">wasn’t</span> <span class="s1"> Rio that her wife had not noticed.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">But of course, Rio had.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Rio’s gaze flickered downward, lingering just long enough for Agatha to know she had seen it. There was no reaction, no shift in expression, just the faintest tightening of her jaw before she turned and left without another word, disappearing through the foyer and out the front door.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha wanted to throw herself off a building. She couldn’t imagine anything feeling worse than this.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Frustration coiled tight in Agatha’s chest, sharp and suffocating. Without thinking, she gave Sage a firm bop on the side of the head- not enough to hurt, but enough to make her point crystal clear.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Sage flinched, scrunching her face in exaggerated offense before cracking one eye open. She muttered something incoherent and dramatic under her breath, but she didn’t bother keeping up the act. She knew she had been caught.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">-</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sage had been prattling on about some book she was determined for Agatha to read, speaking with the kind of conviction that suggested it was nothing short of </span> <span class="s2">life changing.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Somewhere mid sentence, Sage had hopped off the couch, determined to retrieve it herself. She disappeared into the study, reemerging moments later with the book in hand, stepping past the armchair just as Rio walked by the entrance of the living room.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">It was the first time Rio and Sage had even made eye contact since the day before, since the moment the person Sage had trusted most had </span> <span class="s2">torn her apart limb from limb.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Sage startled.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Not just a quick flinch, not something small Sage could shake off and pretend never happened, not something they could all quietly agree to ignore.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">She fucking </span> <span class="s2">stumbled</span><span class="s1">.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Sage’s foot caught against the back leg of the chair, her entire body jerking backward, as if she had been shoved. It wasn’t just shock- it was instinct.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">For a split second, it looked as if Sage’s body had reacted before her mind had time to catch up, like some deep rooted survival instinct had decided, without hesitation, that she needed to get away from Rio.</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">At that exact moment, </span> <span class="s2">lightning struck.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">The sky outside flashed white, and a split second later, </span> <span class="s2">thunder cracked so loudly the walls trembled.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Sage had panicked. And worse than that, </span> <span class="s2">she had looked scared.</span></p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1">Agatha felt her stomach drop so violently she was half convinced she had just shit it out of her own asshole.</span>
</p><p class="p2">
<span class="s1"><br/>-</span>
</p><p class="p1"> </p><p class="p2"><span class="s1">Agatha braced herself because this was going to be </span> <span class="s2">merciless.</span> <span class="s1"> There would be no smooth landing, no way out unscathed. This was going to be fucking brutal.</span></p>

<p>Three weeks.</p><p> </p><p>Three weeks of watching something fester, spreading like decay through everything she loved.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could taste it, thick and acrid, clinging to the back of her throat like something rancid. She could smell it, pungent and overripe, sinking into the air, coating everything in a stench she could not escape.</p><p> </p><p>It was foul. It was unrelenting. And it was poisoning the very roots of everything that had made Agatha feel whole. </p><p> </p><p>And Agatha was caught in it, standing at the center of something rotting from the inside out, unsure if she could stop the decay or if she was only delaying the inevitable.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p>Day 1:</p><p> </p><p>In the aftermath of Sage stumbling back in fear at nothing more than Rio’s presence, Agatha sat frozen, a captive in her own body, forced to watch something that should have been beyond corruption, now twisted into something unrecognizable.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t look angry. She looked horrified, as if she had just witnessed an atrocity more devastating than anything she had encountered in her entire existence. Her eyes were wide with an almost paralyzing disbelief, as though the very foundation of her understanding had been shaken. It was as if Rio were staring at a reality too cruel to accept.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to look away, unable to stomach the sight before her, but she couldn’t tear her eyes from her wife. Rio stood rigid, holding herself still with a precision that felt agonizing, as if every muscle in her body were locked in place by sheer force of will. Agatha saw the faint tremor in her fingers, the way they twitched at her side, desperate for motion yet refusing to move. Rio was fighting it- fighting the instinct to reach out, to soothe, to comfort her child the way any mother would.</p><p> </p><p>But fear held Rio captive, a fear that any movement, no matter how small, might send Sage retreating further.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could see it, could feel it as if the thought had passed through her own mind.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t see the woman who had raised her, who had loved her. She had seen Death for what it truly was, not the quiet, inevitable force Rio had surely once tried to teach her to understand, but something far more merciless. Sage had seen its cruelty, its indifference, its capacity for devastation. And now, standing frozen in the threshold of their living room, Rio was no longer a mother wanting to reach for her child. She was Lady Death, a figure to be feared.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s own daughter, afraid of Death.</p><p> </p><p>The same child Rio had once cradled in her arms, so impossibly small, trusting without question. Rio had looked down at her baby and wondered why something as innocent as this had chosen Death, a monster, to be her mother.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, Sage had only reached up with chubby fingers, giggling, touching the face of Death without fear. It had been love at first sight.</p><p> </p><p>And now?</p><p> </p><p>That same child stood before Rio and Agatha, fully grown, and terrified of the very thing she had once embraced without hesitation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel it in the air, thick and suffocating, the weight of Rio’s worst nightmare crashing down around her. Knowing Rio had most likely always been afraid of this moment. Afraid that the thing she was, the thing she had no choice but to be, would one day eclipse everything else. That it would take her daughter from her- not in the way Death usually took, but in a way far crueler. A mother rejected, not because of what she had done, but because of what she was.</p><p> </p><p>It was unbearable. Agatha wished, more than anything, that this had never happened- that Rio had never found that godforsaken journal, that she had stepped in before Rio had torn Sage apart with nothing but words.</p><p> </p><p>And that was the worst part. They were just words.</p><p> </p><p>It shouldn’t have come to this. It shouldn’t have left Sage looking at her own mother like she was something to be feared. Agatha couldn’t make sense of it, couldn’t reconcile the gravity of Sage’s fright with the reality of what had happened. It didn’t warrant this. It didn’t warrant any of this.</p><p> </p><p>Nothing compared to watching Rio, the woman she loves beyond reason, stand paralyzed in their own home, too afraid to move, too afraid to breathe, because their daughter was looking at her like she was a monster.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled into the couch, nails biting deep into the fabric as she forced herself to stay still. But in her chest, she felt it, a flicker where chaos threatened to catch and burn. Suddenly, she wanted to wage war. To carve a path of destruction through the world with nothing but rage and ruin, to slaughter every witch who had ever dared to cross her, to burn entire cities to ash until there was nothing left but silence. Whatever it took to undo this.</p><p> </p><p>To prove that Rio had never been and would never be something to fear.</p><p> </p><p>If Sage was afraid of Rio for what she was, for something she had no choice in, then Agatha would be something worse. She would be the thing to fear, the thing to hate. She would drown out Sage’s terror in something greater, something louder. If it meant never having to see Rio like this, standing in the absence of the certainty that her daughter would always be hers, then Agatha would become whatever monster was necessary.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to Sage, fury still crackling in her veins, ready to strike. But the moment their eyes met, everything inside her stilled.</p><p> </p><p>Sage wasn’t looking at Rio. She was looking at Agatha. Wide eyed, unmoving, clutching the book so tightly to her chest her fingers had gone white. And she was looking at Agatha like she was the only person who could keep her safe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had never been the one people turned to for protection. She had always been the blade, never the shield. But now, Sage was staring at Agatha like she was the only thing tethering their daughter to safety.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha despised the shift. Not just the fear in Sage’s face, but the certainty behind it, the quiet, terrible belief that Rio was the one to be afraid of, that Agatha was the only one left to trust.</p><p> </p><p>Sitting rigid on the couch, Agatha felt pulled in two directions. Sage stood trembling before her, while Rio remained in the threshold of the living room, motionless, wearing the terror of a nightmare made real. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know where to move, who to reach for, what to say to fix this.</p><p> </p><p>Rio made the decision for her. Agatha saw it in the way her gaze dropped, not in doubt but in defense, locking it away before anything else could be touched. When Rio looked up again, her eyes were unreadable, her presence held behind an invisible wall. Rio didn’t meet either of their eyes, only gave a slight nod, “I’ll go.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was already moving, barely aware of herself as she scrambled toward Rio. She thought she heard her own voice, a shout ripped from somewhere deep, but she couldn’t be sure. The panic was too loud. Rio couldn’t leave. Not now. Not like this. Agatha had given too much, fought too hard, poured every part of herself into rebuilding into someone better, someone worth holding on to. Rio was her shield, her sanctuary. Without her, everything she had worked for would mean nothing.</p><p> </p><p>She caught Rio’s wrist before she could reach the door, her grip firm. “You’re coming back.” It wasn’t a question. It was a demand. Rio nodded, the gesture small, almost reluctant, but she didn’t look at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“How long?” Agatha demanded, the words escaping harsher than she intended, but couldn’t bring herself to soften.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her nothing in return. No answer, no glance, not even a flicker of acknowledgment. She wasn’t going to answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, her vision blurring as she fought to keep control. This time, it barely made it past her lips, a fractured whisper forced through clenched teeth as she fought against the sting behind her eyes. Agatha’s fingers dug into Rio’s wrist, holding on with a force that bordered on pleading- to keep her here, to keep her from becoming something Agatha could no longer reach.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t asking for much, just an answer, just something solid to hold on to. If Rio needed space, fine. Whatever. But Agatha needed to know she was coming back home.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered to Agatha before dropping back to the ground. Her tongue pressed into her cheek, not with its usual smugness but with effort, an attempt to keep her guard from slipping. Rio was trying, trying to hold firm, willing herself to stay untouchable.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re my wife,” Agatha said, not as a reminder but as a claim. Agatha had finally let herself accept it, finally chosen to hold onto it, and that had to mean something. Rio owed her an answer. She owed her the same damn certainty Agatha had fought to believe in again.</p><p> </p><p>“A few hours,” Rio whispered, the words slipping out too fast, like she regretted saying them the moment they left her lips. Her eyes stayed fixed on the floor, unmoving, unwilling. Agatha was beginning to hate that fucking floor, itching to tear it apart if it meant that Rio would just look at her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could see it- the hesitation, the quiet frustration. Rio had told the truth, but she wasn’t ready to stand in it. She wanted to hold onto her armor just a little longer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shoulders relaxed slightly, but her grip on Rio’s wrist didn’t falter. It wasn’t enough. Her eyes burned into Rio, demanding more than half spoken words and avoidance. Agatha refused to let go, refused to let Rio slip any further away, until finally, with a quiet surrender, Rio met her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally met her eyes, something in her wavered. The hardness didn’t break, but it thinned. “Just give me a few hours,” Rio said, the words sounding like they were already more than she was willing to give.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held Rio there, studying every inch of her face, searching for even the smallest trace of a lie. There was nothing. There never was. It had always been that way, even centuries ago. Rio had never known how to be anything but honest, even when the truth was the cruelest thing she could give.</p><p> </p><p>Before letting go of Rio’s wrist, Agatha asked, “Would begging make you stay?” She already knew the answer, but she had to ask. Agatha needed to be certain there was nothing left to offer. This was not about holding Rio back. It was about making sure her wife understood that Agatha would give her anything if she only asked.</p><p> </p><p>Though if Agatha had any say in it, she would rather not be caught in the crossfire between Sage and Rio when the moment came.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, understanding exactly what Agatha was asking. And Agatha understood too. Knew that if she swallowed her pride and begged, Rio wouldn’t walk out that door. But then what? They would be stuck in the same mess, suffocating in it together. A few hours wasn’t much. Just a little space, a little air, a chance to hit pause on the emotional demolition derby this afternoon had turned into. Just a few hours.</p><p> </p><p>“Only a few hours,” Agatha whispered, needing Rio to say it again. </p><p> </p><p>Rio closed her eyes, exhaling like the words were pulling the last of her strength from her. “Only a few hours,” she repeated, not just answering, but giving Agatha the only thing she had left to offer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let go. The moment her fingers slipped away, Rio exhaled a slow breath, like she had been holding herself together just long enough to make it this far. She turned, opened the door, and stepped forward. Then Rio stopped.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t need to look. She already knew. The weather. Sunny. Again. Too sunny. Suspicious.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have the strength to question it. Not now. Later. She would deal with it later.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate, didn’t look back. She just kept moving, down the porch steps, across the dirt path, and straight into the portal. Then she was gone. Agatha stared at the empty space she left behind before shutting the door and letting her head fall against it with a dull thud.</p><p> </p><p>Time to deal with the other one. The arguably bigger pain in her ass.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had thought female friendships were insufferable. But mothers and daughters were an entirely different nightmare. There was no distance, no boundaries, no way to keep them from getting under each other’s skin. A mother’s love could be a sanctuary just as easily as it could be a cage. A daughter’s defiance could be rebellion or self preservation, depending on the day. They knew each other too well, had too much of the other buried inside them to ever be separate, no matter how much they wanted to be.</p><p> </p><p>It was invasive. It was relentless. And worst of all, it never faded. Even when they tore themselves apart, it stayed. Lurking in their words, in their silences, in the parts of themselves they couldn’t escape. Whether it was love or fury, devotion or resentment, it lived in them forever.</p><p> </p><p>And unfortunately for Agatha, she couldn’t escape it. Not even after ending her own relationship with her mother in the most permanent way possible. It was immune to murder, defying even the cleanest severance, somehow still leading her right to a daughter of her own.</p><p> </p><p>And not only did she get the full experience of the mind fuckery that came with having a daughter, but she also had the rare and coveted privilege of watching her wife go through it too- with the daughter that was, undeniably, theirs. A double feature she never bought tickets for, yet somehow, she was the one getting dragged across the stage while the real stars tore the set apart.</p><p> </p><p>And in the aftermath, standing in the ruins, having lived through every version of it as a daughter, as a mother, as a wife caught between the two, she knew one thing.</p><p> </p><p>No matter how many times the stage fell apart, no matter how disastrous the performance, the show always went on. And whether she liked it or not, Agatha would be there. Sometimes pulled into the chaos, sometimes stepping into it on her own, but always returning for the next act.</p><p> </p><p> For better or worse, this was her show too.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha put on her big girl panties and braced herself for the next act. She pushed off the door and made her way to the living room, where Sage was parked in the armchair like a kid who had put herself in time out just to look responsible. A preemptive strike. An attempt to soften the inevitable. She wanted Agatha to see it.. to see Sage in the wreckage, just as much a casualty as the one who had stormed out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha dropped onto the couch, the same spot where it she had watched it all unfold. The air still felt heavy with it. She could feel Sage watching her, waiting, but she didn’t acknowledge her. Instead, she threw her head back against the cushion and let out a long, frustrated groan.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed like that for a moment, staring at the ceiling, refusing to look at Sage when she finally spoke, “That was fucking awful.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage stayed silent. Agatha looked up, expecting a response, but none came. Just quiet. She let out a slow breath, steadying herself before speaking. “I told her to love me, and she lived to ruin me.” </p><p> </p><p>Sage furrowed her brow, shifting in her seat. “Wuthering Heights?” Her gaze swept over Agatha, deliberate and unimpressed. “Fitting.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. <em>Ouch.</em></p><p> </p><p>The comparison was obvious, even to Agatha- a love so consuming it blurred the line between devotion and destruction, a bond that refused to die no matter how many times it was torn apart.</p><p> </p><p>She was reducing centuries of agony, longing, and inevitability into a trope. A literary fucking cliché. As if she and Rio were nothing more than another tragic, self destructive love story.</p><p> </p><p>Not exactly high praise.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, lips curving into a tight, humorless smile, “Hilarious.” She swallowed her irritation, because if she reacted the way she wanted to, she might just wring Sage’s neck.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t meant to hand Sage ammunition. She had intended to make a point. To force her to see where this was headed, to make her understand the devastation waiting for her if she didn’t stop.</p><p> </p><p>In Wuthering Heights, Catherine’s father had spoken those words after realizing, too late, that the daughter he had loved so completely had become someone he no longer recognized. Someone who had taken that love and, knowingly or not, turned it into ruin. Agatha had meant to draw that parallel. To make Sage see that, whether she intended to or not, she had already caused damage in ways she could never take back.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha understood. The first wound wasn’t a choice. Hurt happened. Pain changed people. Sage had reacted, had felt it, and that was understandable. But what came next, what she did with it, mattered more.</p><p> </p><p>One time was forgivable. One time was human.</p><p> </p><p>But if Sage kept walking this path, if she let fear fester into resentment and allowed it to shape her, it would harden her until forgiveness tasted disgusting on her tongue, until she could no longer stomach the thought of it at all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had already seen it in the way Sage had nearly killed Billy. She had been so consumed by her fury that she couldn’t see anything else. That kind of anger could eat a person alive. Agatha knew because she had been that person. She had let her rage consume her. She had let it make choices for her. She had let it dictate who she became. And by the time she had stopped to look at what she had done, at what she had lost, it had nearly been too late.</p><p> </p><p>And she knew Rio hadn’t helped. Her words had already taken root in Sage, sinking into the deepest, most vulnerable parts of her, latching onto every fear and unspoken hurt. In her anger, Rio had planted a seed of doubt, and now it was beginning to grow into something that strangled the soul, twisting itself around Sage, tightening until it left no room for anything else.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha would try not let that happen. Not to Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Not her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was better than Agatha had ever been. She was good. For all the ways she took after Agatha, she was just as much Rio’s daughter. She had Rio’s kindness.She carried Rio’s emotional depth, the ability to read between silences, to understand wounds even when no one spoke of them. She had Rio’s instinct to care, to nurture, to make things grow- whether that was plants, people, or the fragile bonds between them.</p><p> </p><p>But even good people could lose themselves if they didn’t stop to see what was being lost along the way.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her head fall back against the couch, staring at the ceiling as if the answer might be hidden in the cracks.  She was grasping for anything, any way to bridge the widening gap between her wife and daughter.</p><p> </p><p>This was new to Agatha- trying to put out a fire instead of stoking it.</p><p> </p><p>She looked at Sage, who sat motionless, staring blankly at the coffee table. She was too still, too quiet, lost in a place Agatha couldn’t follow.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you just…” Agatha’s voice faltered, the words slipping away before she could catch them. After a beat, she exhaled, quieter this time. “What can I do to help fix this?” It wasn’t a plea, nor a demand. Just defeat.</p><p> </p><p>Sage looked at Agatha as if she had only just registered her presence. Her gaze flickered away, then back again, lips parting as if to speak, but the words never came. She hesitated, started to shrug, but the motion fell apart before it could fully form.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know.” Her voice wavered, and she shook her head, a breathless, watery laugh slipping out- thin, exhausted, empty. “I don’t know,” she said again, quieter this time. Sadder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a heavy sigh. They were all lost. Completely, utterly lost.</p><p> </p><p>It was almost pathetic how none of them could handle even the smallest crack without it spreading into something jagged and unfixable. But that was the reality of it. They were not normal. They had never been normal. And nothing about this, about them, ever would be.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave Sage a once over, exhaling sharply as she swallowed her pride. She could barely bring herself to look at Sage when she spoke, already bracing for the discomfort of what she was about to say.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you… want a hug or something?” The words felt unnatural in Agatha’s mouth, clumsy and insufferably sentimental.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted, sitting up straighter like that might make the question feel less ridiculous. Rubbing her nose, she sniffed loudly, then folded her arms over her chest and finally glanced at Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Sage looked at her with those big, sad green eyes, ones that might have rivaled Rio’s deep brown ones if she had the years Rio had to perfect it. But Rio had lifetimes to master that look.</p><p> </p><p>Sage just nodded.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave a quick nod and pushed herself to her feet, moving before she could second guess it. The faster she did this, the less time she had to talk herself out of it.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, come on then,” Agatha said, impatience creeping into her tone as she motioned for Sage to get up.</p><p> </p><p>Sage sprang from the chair and into Agatha’s arms before she lost her chance. The force of it nearly knocked Agatha off balance, Sage’s chin landing against her shoulder as she clung to her with an almost desperate grip.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood frozen, unsure what to do with her arms, pinned at her sides by Sage’s hold. Slowly, she worked them free, hesitating for only a moment before wrapping them around her daughter. Sage, feeling the embrace returned, loosened her grip just enough to let Agatha move.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let herself breathe, let herself lean into it, unburdened by guilt or second guessing. For once, she did not think about what it meant or if she was doing it right. She just held her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt Sage shake her head, her voice muffled against her shoulder. “I don’t want to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled, a quiet, knowing sigh. “I know.”</p><p> </p><p>She Sage tighter, holding on just a little longer.</p><p> </p><p>Sage let out a dramatic sigh. “Wow, this is getting sentimental. Should I start calling you Mom now?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stiffened immediately.</p><p> </p><p>Honestly, she wanted nothing more than. Sage had called her Ma once before, said it casually, effortlessly, and then moved on like it had never happened. Like it had meant nothing. But Agatha had held onto it, turning it over in her mind, hoping that it would have stuck.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, masking the want beneath feigned irritation. “Alright, you ruined it. Unhand me.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage scoffed but tightened her grip. “Nope. You’re stuck. Accept your fate.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held Sage close, her voice quieter now. “I get why you reacted like that.” She tilted her head slightly, considering. “Well… sorta.” She sighed, searching for the right words. “Look, she’s not some terrifying force looming over you. She’s Rio. Your mother. And she messed up.” Her voice softened, but there was a firm edge to it. “So just… don’t hold on to what she said. I know it was shitty and hurtful and maybe even terrifying, but don’t let it sink its teeth into you. Don’t let it swallow you whole. Okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage pulled back, shaking her head as she stepped around Agatha and dropped onto the couch. She crossed her arms, staring ahead, her jaw tight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat beside her, saying nothing, just waiting.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know how,” Sage admitted, her voice barely above a whisper. “I know she regrets it. I know she wants to apologize. But that doesn’t change the fact that she meant it when she said it.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s throat tightened, but she forced the words out anyway. “When I went to sleep last night, I wasn’t even thinking about what she said. I couldn’t. But then I remembered the way she looked at me, like I was nothing. Like I wasn’t even hers. And somehow, that hurt worse.”</p><p> </p><p>She let out a shaky breath, shaking her head. “Then I woke up thinking about it. And now I can’t stop. It just keeps playing over and over, and I don’t know how to make it stop.”</p><p> </p><p>“Believe me, I understand. More than you know.” Agatha kept her voice even, “Take the time you need to sort through it, but don’t lose sight of who she is. She’s not evil. She’s not a monster. And if anyone knows that, it’s you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could only hope Sage was listening.</p><p> </p><p>Sage looked up at Agatha and gave a small nod. “I’ll try.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded back, sinking into the couch with a quiet exhale. “Good. That’s good. Trying is good.”</p><p> </p><p>It was all she could ask for. Just for Sage to try. And it was good. More than Agatha would have ever managed at her daughter’s age.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was good. Agatha reminded herself of that. She wasn’t Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>And that was a relief.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grabbed the remote and turned the TV back on, picking up where they had left off. She couldn’t force anything down Sage’s throat. It wouldn’t work. She had said her piece, and Sage had said she would try. That was enough.</p><p> </p><p>For now, all she could do was let it rest. Let the dust settle. Maybe even distract Sage, if only for a little while.</p><p> </p><p>A couple hours passed before Sage stretched and announced she was heading up to her room. Agatha barely had time to settle into the quiet before a noise outside caught her attention.</p><p> </p><p>A car.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha walked across the living room and stood by the window, just in time to see Rio easing the Subaru they had taken to the beach in reverse down the dirt path. The taillights cutting through the dark and casting long shadows. The car rolled to a stop about fifteen feet from the house, the engine idling.</p><p> </p><p>She watched as Rio stumbled out of the car and made her way to the trunk. Agatha couldn’t see what she was reaching for, but whatever it was, it looked big.</p><p> </p><p>Curious and already suspicious, Agatha went to the door and stepped onto the porch just as Rio started up the dirt path- carrying what appeared to be a massive, empty fish tank.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, eyebrows furrowing. “Do you need help?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached the steps, shifting the tank in her arms as if it weighed nothing. “Yeah, actually. Grab the box up front for me, will you?” She spoke like this was the most natural thing in the world, like she wasn’t casually hauling around a giant fish tank in the dead of night.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had no idea what the hell was going on, but she nodded anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made her way down the porch steps, glancing back every few steps as if Rio might suddenly reappear in the doorway and finally clue her in on whatever was going on.</p><p> </p><p>Reaching the car, she pulled open the passenger door and found the so called box sitting neatly in the seat, buckled in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned over it warily, already dreading whatever insanity Rio had dragged her into this time. Peering inside, she let out a long exhale.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Fish.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Bags upon bags of fish, sealed with air, their little bodies flicking and shifting inside the plastic. Not just a few. A lot.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned, unbuckled the seatbelt, and hefted the box into her arms before heading back to the house. She had barely made it halfway before Rio met her, taking the box from her hands without a word.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood there, arms dropping to her sides, staring in disbelief as Rio carried the fish inside, only to walk right back out almost immediately, as if any of this was normal.</p><p> </p><p>Rio strode past Agatha without a word, leaving her standing there, still trying to process what was happening. Agatha turned just in time to see Rio pop open the trunk and grab a few plastic bags filled with what looked like more aquarium supplies before shutting it again.</p><p> </p><p>As she walked by a second time, Rio barely glanced back. “Are you coming?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, but no words came. She shook her head as if that might somehow make sense of this ridiculous situation, then scrambled to follow her inside.</p><p> </p><p>Once inside, Agatha immediately noticed the garden hose snaking through the back door, trailing into the hallway. Water was already flowing into the tank.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped into the living room and stopped short. In the two minutes it had taken her to get inside, Rio had not only set up the tank but had already arranged every decoration with impossible precision. The wooden aquarium stand beneath it looked like it had been there for years.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t need to ask how. She could smell the air was thick with the telltale scent of magic, clinging to the room like a bad perfume Rio had over applied out of spite.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. She almost felt relieved that Rio had left when she did, because witnessing her cry was excruciating. It was rare, painfully so, and when it happened, Agatha could only compare it to stepping barefoot on a pile of Lego bricks- except the pain didn’t fade, and she couldn’t just curse and walk it off.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s going on?” Agatha asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up briefly, then back down at the bags of fish, shrugging. “She likes the ocean. The ocean has fish in it.”</p><p> </p><p>What an impossibly selfless woman. Their daughter had broken Rio’s heart in a way Agatha was certain she never thought possible, and instead of falling apart, she had gone out and bought an aquarium to set up for her. Rio took the blow as if it were nothing more than a passing breeze, as if she had never learned how to do anything but give, no matter how much it cost her.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you okay?” Agatha asked softly.</p><p> </p><p>“Yep.” Rio’s tone was casual, almost dismissive. “She’s not the first person to look at me like that. I’m used to it.” She still wasn’t looking at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha studied her for a moment. “But is it the first time she’s looked at you like that?” Her voice was careful, testing the waters.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stilled, her gaze shifting over the bags of fish, fingers twitching like she was counting them just to keep her hands busy. “It doesn’t matter.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed. She wasn’t going to push. Instead, she helped Rio finish setting up the tank.</p><p> </p><p>When they were done, they cleaned up and got ready for bed.</p><p> </p><p>Hours later, in the dead of night, Rio got up and slipped out of the room. She had been restless, tossing and turning, unwilling to say whatever was on her mind. Agatha let her go, tried to convince herself to fall asleep. But the thought of what her wife might be up to gnawed at her, refusing to let her rest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lasted forty-five minutes before she gave up on sleep and went looking for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>She wandered down the hall, pausing to glance into the living room before noticing the faint glow from the study. Through the glass sliding doors, she could see Rio at the desk, her face bathed in the light of a laptop screen, completely absorbed in whatever she was doing.</p><p> </p><p>Instead of going straight in, Agatha detoured to the kitchen, grabbed a chair from the table, and carried it with her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio only looked up when Agatha slid the door open. Her gaze flickered to the chair Agatha had dragged along, then back up to her face. A small, genuine smile curved her lips, like she was actually happy Agatha had come to find her.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi,” Rio said softly.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi,” Agatha echoed, matching her smile.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped into the study, moved around the desk, and set the chair down beside Rio’s before settling in. She nodded at the laptop screen. “You have a laptop but no cell phone?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a questioning look. “Never needed one.” Then she pressed her tongue into her cheek, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Though, I wouldn’t be opposed to getting one if it meant I got to sext my ridiculously hot wife.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t bother fighting her smile. “Alright, keep it in your pants, Romeo. I meant to keep in contact with the pain in our ass upstairs.”</p><p> </p><p>At the mention of Sage, Rio’s expression flickered -just for a second- before she smoothed it over, slipping back into something unreadable. She shrugged, turning her attention back to the screen, fingers idly scrolling over the trackpad. “She knows how to get a hold of me,” Rio muttered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother looking at whatever had her wife’s attention. “What does she do, kill a bunch of witches to summon you?” she joked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, finally glancing back at her. “No, shockingly, it’s much less dramatic than that.” Her eyes narrowed slightly, a smirk threatening to return.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage? Not doing something dramatic? I’m shocked. Truly.” Agatha leaned back in her chair. “So how does she get a hold of you then?”</p><p> </p><p>“I just feel it,” Rio said. She pressed a hand to her chest, fingers pressing over her heart like she could hold onto feeling. “It’s a tug,” she said, her voice quieter now, more certain. “Right here. Like she’s got a hold of me and won’t let go until I get to her. The stronger it is, the faster I have to move. It’s how I know she’s calling me.”</p><p> </p><p>Well, what makes that different from when you’re called…” Agatha hesitated, choosing her words carefully before finishing, “to a job?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s fingers twitched against the trackpad, but her gaze didn’t waver. “It’s not the same,” she said. “When I’m called to a soul, it’s cold. Heavy. Like a weight settling over me, pressing until I have no choice but to move. But with Sage…” Her hand drifted to her chest again, pressing over her heart. “It’s warm. It pulls, not pushes. Like she’s reaching for me, not dragging me forward. There’s no resistance. Just… knowing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed in acknowledgment, her gaze finally drifting to Rio’s laptop screen. It didn’t take long to see what had her so absorbed. The page was filled with dense text and fragmented theories, all circling the same subject- the personification of Death.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed. “What are you doing?” she asked, nodding toward Rio’s laptop.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes flicked back to the screen before she leaned back in her chair, hands retreating into her lap as she swiveled slightly toward Agatha. Their knees bumped, but Rio didn’t look up. Instead, her eyes settled on her fingers, twisting idly in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been researching,” Rio muttered. “Trying to figure out how she came up with that ridiculous-” She cut herself off, exhaling sharply before dragging a hand down her face. When she spoke again, her voice was flatter, more controlled. “I just want to know where she’s getting all this from.” Rio gestured lazily toward Sage’s little brown journal, the source of Sage’s most elaborate scheme.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze drifted to the books scattered across her desk, thick tomes filled with dense, archaic text. Grimoires, philosophical treatises, and histories, all orbiting the same inescapable subject. Death.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers brushed the worn edge of a cover before she spoke, unable to hide the interest in her voice. “Why?” The question left her too quickly, too eager. Maybe Rio was considering it. Agatha wouldn’t mind that. An afterlife with her wife, with their son, and undoubtedly Sage, given her ties to the beyond. She forced the thought aside before it could settle too deeply.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean,” Agatha corrected, tempering her curiosity, “why are you looking into it if you have no intention of following through? Seems like you’re just giving yourself another reason to be angry.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lowered her eyes to her hands, exhaling a quiet breath. Her tongue pressed into her bottom lip before she glanced up at the ceiling, shaking her head. Leaning back, Rio let her head rest against the chair. </p><p> </p><p>After a moment, she lifted her head, her expression unreadable as she met Agatha’s stare. With a shrug, she simply said, “She’s your daughter.”</p><p> </p><p>Understanding settled over Agatha in an instant. Rio wasn’t just digging for answers, she was fortifying herself. She had been pulling apart every thread of Sage’s plan, mapping out every possible route it could take, ensuring there wasn’t a single path Sage could walk without Rio seeing it first. This wasn’t curiosity. It was preparation. A quiet war waged in advance, a safeguard against whatever Sage could potentially set in motion.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was protecting herself.</p><p> </p><p>Just as she always had with Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Oh.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes dropped from Rio’s, and she cleared her throat. The shift in her expression must have registered because Rio was already backpedaling. “No, I didn’t mean that in a bad-”</p><p> </p><p>“Our daughter.” Agatha cut her off, her voice firm but quiet. She glanced at Rio before looking back at the scattered books on the desk. “She’s our daughter,” she reminded her.</p><p> </p><p>Summoning the nerve to meet Rio’s gaze again, Agatha found her already watching, her stare unwavering, cutting straight through her. After a beat, Rio gave a small nod. “Our daughter,” she echoed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha returned the nod before saying, “She told me you had to be willing.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed playfully, narrowing her eyes at Agatha. “Neither of you ever accept the fine print without finding a way to rewrite it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed, a smirk tugging at her lips. “Well, if the fine print was any good to begin with, no one would need to rewrite it.”</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio could open her mouth to launch into the same tired argument about how the fine print existed for a reason, Agatha cut her off. “Weird how she didn’t even grow up around me and still turned out exactly like me. Feels like the universe’s way of telling you to go to hell.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, loud and unrestrained, and for a moment, it was the only sound that mattered. Agatha would trade eternity itself to keep that sound from fading.</p><p> </p><p>“Raising her felt like that sometimes,” Rio admitted, the smile still lingering. “But I loved it. She was a reminder that you weren’t just some figment of my imagination, something my mind created to cope with eternity. You were real, even when you felt like a dream.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was starting to realize she didn’t hate sentimentality as much as she pretended to. No poem, no grand piece of literature, had ever struck her the way Rio’s words did. Nothing else had ever made her feel this full, this certain. And it infuriated her to think of how much time she had spent running from the one thing that had ever truly been hers.</p><p> </p><p>“For as much as Sage is like me, she's just as much you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio scoffed, but Agatha ignored it. She knew Rio was trying to be a gentleman, probably assuming Agatha was about to feed her ego. But this was not flattery. It was fact.</p><p> </p><p>“She makes that ridiculous smirk you do. She’s brilliant beyond reason. She feels everything -hers, everyone else’s- like it’s woven into her. And like you, she’s good. Not in the way people like to claim goodness, not in a way that begs for recognition. She just is. It’s in the way she cares, in the way she loves, in the way she refuses to let the world see us as nothing more than cruel. That is you, Rio, whether you want to see it or not.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha recognized the way Rio bit her lip and gave a small nod, the sign of a battle waging behind her eyes. She was holding back, resisting the urge to argue, to tell Agatha she was wrong. But Agatha wasn’t wrong, and she would say it a thousand times over if that was what it took for Rio to finally believe it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went on, her voice steady. “Nicky was a lot like you too, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, and she seemed to shrink back, as if making herself smaller might keep Agatha from realizing she was still there. As if her presence might change Agatha’s mind or scare her away. But Agatha had never been more certain of anything.</p><p> </p><p>“He had your kindness, your heart,” she said, a quiet, unsteady laugh slipping past her lips. “And God, he was you all over again. Every time he smiled, I saw you. That same light in his eyes, that same impossibly sweet gap in his teeth. Some days, it felt like torture, like the universe was mocking me with the life we could never have. But other days… I let myself imagine. I would watch him laugh and pretend that things had been different. That you weren’t bound to Death and immortality, that I wasn’t a woman stained in blood. That we were just us, raising our son in a world where we had nothing to run from, nothing to fight against. A world where we were free.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio said nothing, her expression unreadable except for the single tear that slipped from her left eye. Agatha met her gaze with a quiet, knowing smile before reaching up, brushing the tear away with her thumb. She let her hand linger for only a moment before retreating, folding it gently back into her lap.</p><p> </p><p>“I, uh-” Agatha leaned back in her chair, a quiet, uncertain laugh escaping her. Nerves crept in where they had no place, settling in her chest. “I think he died while I was sleeping because he knew I couldn’t fight it. He was tired, and he probably knew it would break me to watch him willingly choose you.” She paused, not from hesitation but to make sure the next words landed exactly as they should. “I understand now. It wasn’t you. It was never you. And more importantly…” Her voice didn’t waver, “I forgive you.”</p><p> </p><p>The words left her, and Agatha braced for the worst. She expected them to catch in her throat, to choke her on the way out, to turn bitter the moment they touched the air. She expected them to taste like something spoiled, something she would never be able to force herself to say again.</p><p> </p><p>But they didn’t.</p><p> </p><p>She pressed her fingers to her lips, startled by the absence of bitterness, by the way the words had slipped so easily from her tongue. There was no sting, no bile rising in her throat, no urge to spit them back out. She had spent so long believing this moment would never come, that she would never be capable of saying them, of meaning them.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, here they were. Spoken. Swallowed.</p><p> </p><p>More than that, Agatha could say them again. And she would.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at Rio, eyes wide, a strange sense of relief settling in her chest. She had expected doubt, maybe even defiance, but Rio only sat there, still and quiet, as if the words had struck her just as deeply. When she finally spoke, it was with a single question.</p><p> </p><p>“How does it taste?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Forgiveness.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha breathed out, her fingers still pressed to her lips savoring its taste. A slow, knowing smile tugged at the corner of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“Sweet.”</p><p> </p><p>Like the first taste of something forbidden, something she had spent centuries resisting, only to find it had never been poison at all.</p><p> </p><p>Rio fought back a smile as she turned to her laptop, calmly closing it before slipping it into a drawer. Without another word, she stood up, and Agatha watched with wide eyes as Rio swept everything from her desk in a single decisive motion. Books, papers, and anything else Agatha hadn’t bothered to notice crashed loudly to the floor, scattering at their feet.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, her wife, a woman who treated the world like a carefully arranged puzzle, where every piece had its place and nothing was left to chance. It wasn’t just the study that followed this unspoken order- it was everything. From the way she moved through a room to the way she structured her thoughts, she lived by precision, by control. Chaos was something to be tamed, not indulged.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, without hesitation, she had sent it all crashing to the floor.</p><p> </p><p>With wide eyes and an amused smile curling at Agatha’s lips, she drawled. “Well, would you look at that? Rio Vidal, rewriting her own fine print. What a bad, bad boy.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s response was swift and wordless. Her fingers curled into Agatha’s shirt, fisting the fabric as she yanked her forward, pulling Agatha out of the chair and into her. Their lips met in a collision of heat and urgency, mouths parting, tongues tangling as if Rio could taste the sweetness lingering there. A low, guttural moan tore from her throat, reverberating through the study, and the sound alone sent a shiver down Agatha’s spine, forcing her own breathless moan in response.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cupped Rio’s face in both hands, tilting her head, deepening the kiss, drinking her in wanting to be consumed. With a swift turn, Agatha spun them, pressing Rio flush against the desk, her body fitting against her like a force that had always been meant to collide. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the fervor bleed into something deeper, something Rio could savor. Her hands traced over familiar places, reverent in their touch, worshiping what had always been sacred.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was a temple, and temples deserved devotion.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers slid beneath the waistband of Rio’s sleep shorts, palms molding to the curves of her ass cheeks before she gave a firm squeeze, earning exactly the reaction she wanted. With practiced ease, Agatha pushed the fabric down, letting it settle just below Rio’s thighs before lifting her onto the desk, her lips never breaking from Rio’s, refusing to let go, refusing to give her even a second to breathe without her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back slightly, and Agatha followed without hesitation, unwilling to part even for a second. Rio melted back into the kiss with a quiet moan, her hands sliding up to cradle Agatha’s face, one resting beneath her chin and the other curling around the nape of her neck. When Rio tugged gently, Agatha allowed it but chased every word that left her lips with another kiss.</p><p> </p><p>“We. Need. To. Clean. This. Up. After.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha grunted in response, uninterested in anything beyond the warmth of Rio’s skin beneath her hands. She dipped her head to Rio’s neck, pressing hot, open mouthed kisses against it as her fingers found the hem of Rio’s shirt. She tugged it upward, slow but insistent, and the moment the fabric was gone, she continued her path downward, mouth trailing over newly exposed skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sucked, bit, and soothed, each touch a deliberate worship.</p><p> </p><p>She moved lower, down to Rio’s chest, determined to make her forget about the mess entirely.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back on Agatha’s head, her grip firm but not forceful. “We’ll clean this up, yeah?” Her voice was ragged, breath uneven, eyes dark with something entirely consuming.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, her fingers brushing over Rio’s cheek while her other hand trailed lower, toying with a pert nipple. The reaction was immediate. Rio moaned again, the sound sending a fresh wave of heat pooling between Agatha’s thighs as if she weren’t already soaked beyond reason.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, my love,” Agatha murmured, her voice laced with amusement. “Don’t worry your pretty little obsessive mind.” She leaned in, letting her lips ghost over Rio’s before whispering, “Now, if you don’t mind, I would really love to make love to my wife.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded eagerly, and Agatha followed through on her promise. She made love to Rio with the kind of devotion that left no room for doubt. And when Rio came, screaming her name like a prayer, Agatha swore this must be what heaven tasted like.</p><p> </p><p>Later that night, after they had cleaned the study floor with meticulous care, placing every book and paper exactly as Rio liked, they lay naked in bed, tangled in each other’s warmth.</p><p> </p><p>In the quiet, Rio turned to her, her voice softer now. “Did you mean it?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha met those wide, brown eyes without hesitation, “More than anything. Every single word.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha truly did.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Day 2:</p><p> </p><p>Rio and Agatha sat on the couch, the quiet of the morning settling around them, the television playing low in the background. At the first creak of Sage’s footsteps descending the stairs, Rio tensed beside her, body going taut like a wire pulled too tight. Agatha didn’t turn to look. Acknowledging it felt intrusive, like stepping into a moment that wasn’t meant for her.<br/><br/></p><p> </p><p>Sage moved past them toward the study without so much as a glance in their direction.</p><p> </p><p>Everything had been carefully put away- every book, every scrap of Rio’s restless research, every desperate attempt to understand the growing distance between them. Even Sage’s journal had been hidden, a safeguard against the kind of discovery that would only push her further away.</p><p> </p><p>And then, Sage stopped.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nearly gave herself whiplash turning to see her, eyes locking onto where their daughter stood, frozen mid step. Agatha didn’t have to look to know what had caught Sage’s attention.</p><p> </p><p>The fish tank.</p><p> </p><p>The soft glow of the saltwater filtered through the morning light, casting slow moving ripples across the walls, mimicking the ocean’s pulse.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was on her feet in an instant, turning to Sage with barely restrained anticipation. She looked like a child unveiling a masterpiece, like she had built something worth marveling at and was waiting (hoping) for the validation that would make it all worth it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice broke the silence, overly casual yet undeniably eager. “It’s a fish tank. With fish. Saltwater, like the ocean.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t respond. Her brow furrowed, lips pressing together as if she were trying to understand why Rio was speaking to her at all. There was no curiosity in her expression, no flicker of recognition, just quiet, detached bewilderment. If Agatha had been paying the exchange any real attention, the look alone would have sent her over the edge.</p><p> </p><p>The light in the living room shifted. The sunlight that had filled the space only moments ago was swallowed by a sudden overcast, clouds stretching thick across the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood facing Sage, shoulders still squared with lingering expectation, but the certainty in her stance had already begun to wane. The eager anticipation that had once lit her eyes only moments ago faded, replaced by something subdued, something retreating into itself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t need to guess why.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice was softer now, hesitant in a way that made Agatha’s chest tighten. “Cool, huh?” The words wavered, her usual confidence absent.</p><p> </p><p>Sage barely acknowledged her. She gave a half hearted shrug, muttering a quiet, “Sure,” with little interest. Her tone lacked curiosity, as if Rio’s efforts were nothing more than an afterthought rather than the deliberate gesture they had been, built with the singular hope that Sage would give a shit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into the couch cushions, her knuckles white with restraint. She willed herself to stay still, to keep her eyes fixed ahead, knowing that if she looked- if she so much as glanced in their direction- she would cross the couch in an instant. She would take Sage by the shoulders, shake her until she understood, until she saw the devastation she was leaving in her wake. Not just in Rio, but in all of them.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, Agatha stayed still and listened.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s footsteps carried her toward the study. Her tone brightened in an instant. “Tootie,” she greeted, voice light and affectionate. The moment she spoke, the clouds outside thinned, sunlight returning as if it had never left.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha listened as Sage rifled through the bookshelf, the occasional thud of shifting spines filling the quiet. A triumphant, “Bingo,” followed before her footsteps retreated toward the backyard.</p><p> </p><p>Rio remained in the same spot, staring at the empty space where Sage had been. For a moment, she looked lost.</p><p> </p><p>Then, with a quiet breath, Rio straightened her shoulders and nodded to herself like she was willing herself to accept whatever scraps Sage was willing to give.</p><p> </p><p>“At least she spoke to me, right?” The words were forced into resembling optimism, but they carried no real warmth. “Silver lining.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned back to the couch, dropping down beside Agatha, pressing as close as she could without asking for comfort outright.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing. She leaned in and kissed Rio on the cheek.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Day 4:</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was getting dressed for the day, but something felt off. The familiar scent of coffee, the one Rio always made for her, was missing. That alone was unusual.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>She stepped out of the bedroom and made her way toward the kitchen, only to stop when she spotted Rio sitting on the couch. A book lay open in her lap, her eyes fixed on the pages with an expression caught between offense and outright irritation. Whatever she was reading, she had taken it as a personal insult.</p><p> </p><p>"Found it in the couch," Rio muttered, her voice flat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn't look up as Agatha approached, her fingers motionless against the open pages. When Agatha reached her, Rio stood abruptly. She shoved the book into Agatha’s hands like holding onto it any longer would burn her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced down at the book in her hands. It was a copy of the same one Rio had defaced at the bookstore, Emily Dickinson’s face printed across the cover. She had caught Sage reading it just the day before. When Agatha gave her a knowing look, Sage had shoved it into the couch cushions with a wide, toothy grin, dismissing the moment entirely. Agatha let it go. She had assumed, perhaps a bit naively, that Sage was softening, drawn to the fragments of life Rio and Agatha had lived before her. Sage devoured their past like a story she had only just discovered, one filled with all the angst she seemed to thrive on.</p><p> </p><p>Sage had slipped the book into the pile Rio bought for her at the bookstore, which was hardly the problem. That was entirely in character. The problem wasn’t the book itself but the page Rio must have turned to when she pulled it from the couch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's gaze fell to the passage in front of her. There was only one annotation in the entire book, a single mark left by Sage’s hand. The first two lines of the poem in the very first stanza were circled:</p><p> </p><p><em> "Because I could not stop for Death, </em> <em><br/></em> <em> She kindly stopped for me." </em></p><p> </p><p>In the margin beside it, Sage had written in that familiar slanted script:</p><p>
<em> ‘Death is not kind. She does not wait. She takes.’ </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. That annotation wasn't just utter bullshit- it was a lie. And she knew for a fact that Sage didn’t believe it. Her daughter had spent weeks destroying that very belief, the one Agatha had held onto for nearly three centuries. The note seemed intentional, purposeful.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tore the page from the book with such force, it snapped the spine beyond repair. She let the book fall to the floor, then kicked it under the couch without a second thought. Crumpling the page in her fist, Agatha shoved it into her mouth and swallowed.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn't Agatha’s proudest moment. Not even close. But it also wasn't the first time she had eaten a piece of paper just to make sure no one ever had to look at it again, including herself.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, Rio took the blow with ease, brushing it off as if it had never touched her. Agatha had seen it countless times before and had been the cause of it more than she cared to admit. Rio had a way of absorbing hurt without letting it surface, carrying it in silence as if it had never reached her at all. But Agatha knew better. Beneath the indifference, there was that same quiet patience, the same tireless hope that soon enough her daughter would see past her anger and forgive her. Rio had never been one to demand forgiveness. She would wait for it, whether it came or not.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Day 7:</p><p> </p><p>On multiple occasions, Sage pulled Agatha away from Rio. Agatha justified it as an opportunity to work on her, to slowly guide her toward forgiveness. Rio, as always, took it without complaint, never letting it come between her and Agatha. But the more their daughter chose Agatha, the more obvious Sage made it. She wanted Agatha, and she made sure Rio knew it.</p><p> </p><p>This particular morning, Rio had been waiting in the living room for Sage to wake up and come downstairs, ready to try again, ready to fix things. The second she heard footsteps upstairs near Sage’s bedroom door, she sprang up from the armchair and moved to the threshold, attempting to lean casually against its frame. She readjusted a few times, shifting her weight, trying to look casual. Her arms crossed, then uncrossed, then crossed again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, her back pressed against the arm of the couch, legs stretched across the cushions, pretended to read. Without looking at Rio, she mumbled, “Crossed.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio crossed her arms too tightly, making Agatha groan under her breath. She jerked her book down with both hands, barely keeping her frustration in check over her wife's complete inability to look natural.</p><p> </p><p>“Looser!” Agatha hissed. “You look like you have a stick up your ass with how tight you’re clenching.”</p><p> </p><p>To Agatha’s relief, Rio actually listened. She adjusted instantly, shifting into a stance that finally looked natural, almost effortless. For once, she managed to pull off the unimpressed, relaxed demeanor she had been failing at all morning. Agatha had to admit, Rio looked good like that.</p><p> </p><p>Without missing a beat, Rio spoke, her tone casual, almost inviting. "<em> Housewives </em> NYC marathon? Agatha still hasn’t seen all of it. Fresh eyes to witness Dorinda Medley in all her glory. Oh-” Rio’s expression brightened slightly, “the episode where Aviva slams her leg prosthesis on the table in the middle of a packed restaurant and yells, ‘The only thing that is artificial or fake about me is this’?"</p><p> </p><p>Rio including Agatha in this was a smart move. Sage was a hopeless romantic in every sense, always wanting her family to be whole. She had once been desperate to know them both as her mothers, pulling them together with a determination that bordered on stubbornness. She had dragged them to the beach, packed matching pajamas they never even got to wear. Agatha had thought, for certain, that this plan would work. That Sage still wanted this, even if she would rather withhold it now than admit it.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t respond right away. The silence stretched long enough for Rio to try again.</p><p> </p><p>"Just thought we could all rot on the couch today and watch women in their fifties get blackout drunk on national television. Could be fun." Rio shrugged, arms still crossed, her delivery as casual as if the outcome didn’t matter.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s green eyes, a little less vibrant than usual, flicked briefly to Agatha, lounging on the couch. Agatha raised the book in her hands just slightly, pretending to be absorbed in <em> The Sea Around Us </em> by Rachel Carson. It was a deliberate choice. Sage’s favorite. The perfect cherry on top of what should have been an ideal day- family, reality TV, and an excuse to pester Agatha about science and poetry, somehow twisting oceanography into a metaphor for her life. There was no way Sage could say no to that.</p><p> </p><p>But she did.</p><p> </p><p>Sage glanced back at Rio and said, “We already have plans. Sorry.” She shrugged, unmoving from her spot at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p> </p><p>"Plans?" Rio questioned flatly, already bracing for the lie. "What plans?</p><p> </p><p>Sage hesitated for a second too long, “Uh… we’re gonna get the calculus workbooks and see who can solve the problems faster.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What the fuck? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s arms dropped to her sides. “What?” The confusion was plain on her face as she tried to make sense of Sage’s excuse. She pointed a lazy thumb toward Agatha before looking at her, utterly bewildered by Sage’s excuse. Sage, on the other hand, looked like she had pulled the answer straight out of her ass.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha hates math.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha really did hate math. With every fiber of her being.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, however, continued without missing a beat. “I love math.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had to fight the urge to roll her eyes. Rio had always loved it. Math followed rigid principles, structured logic, and definitive answers. It made sense to Rio in a way the surface and the people on it rarely did.</p><p> </p><p>All the reasons Rio loved math were the very things as to why Agatha fucking despised it. It’s strict adherence to rules, the rigid principles, and its absolute answers. It was everything that went against the very nature of how Agatha had always operated. Magic, manipulation, and survival require adaptability, intuition, and reading between the lines, none of which math allows. There is no room for instinct, no way to outthink the equation, no ability to bend the answer to suit the situation.</p><p> </p><p>But there was an edge to this that made it land harder than it should have. Math wasn’t just a random choice. It was what Rio loved, Sage certainly knew that, which made Agatha wonder if the excuse had been as thoughtless as it seemed.</p><p> </p><p>“We can do that another time,” Rio said, her tone almost even. But Agatha caught the slight falter in her voice, a misstep so brief that Rio covered it almost immediately. A moment later, she sounded effortless again, as if this whole thing wasn’t bothering her the way Agatha knew that it was. “I’d be the better competition anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t turn to Agatha for support. Didn’t look at her for agreement. This was between her and Sage, and Agatha appreciated her wife’s ability to separate the two. As selfless as ever.</p><p> </p><p>It would have been easy for Rio to drag Agatha into it, to turn this into a united front, to force Sage into facing both of them at once. But she never did. No matter how much Sage pushed her, no matter how many times she turned her back on her, Rio refused to let her hurt bleed into Agatha. Rio never used her as a shield, never sought reassurance, never looked to her for permission to be angry.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha knew how much it must have stung. She heard it in the way Rio’s tone faltered, a misstep so brief that she recovered almost immediately. She had seen it in the way Rio paused before speaking, in the way she took each rejection like another step in a never ending test of patience. Still, she held firm, waiting, always waiting, hoping that one day their daughter might turn around and meet her halfway.</p><p> </p><p>Sage, however, was far less forgiving. </p><p> </p><p>She turned her head to Agatha, her expression composed, but the tension in her voice betrayed her. “We had plans,” Sage’s eyebrows lifted, the plea beneath it intentional rather than desperate. She was cornered and she knew it, but instead of conceding, she shifted the burden onto Agatha with just enough expectation in her voice to make refusal feel like betrayal. This wasn’t just about avoiding Rio. It was a careful action, a test disguised as a simple statement, a silent pull for Agatha to choose without making it seem like a choice at all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw the moment Rio caught it and shut it down before it could take hold. She wasn't going to let Sage pull Agatha into this. Their relationships with her were too carefully maintained, too deliberately rebuilt to risk breaking now. They had all come too far to let a single misstep pull them backward.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fine.” Rio shrugged, casual and unbothered. Her mask was back up, smooth and effortless. Honestly, the act was so convincing that even her voice carried an easy warmth, as if she genuinely liked the idea of Sage and Agatha spending more time together. As if she had never been hoping for a different answer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved her wife all the more for it. Rio had always been her shield, never once making Agatha be hers. She took every blow to the chest without hesitation, absorbing the worst of it so Agatha never had to.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve got shit to take care of in the garden anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved toward Sage, her arm lifting slightly like she was about to ruffle her daughter’s hair. It was supposed to be easy, a simple no hard feelings gesture. But then, she hesitated, hand hovering just inches away.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw the exact moment the doubt crept in. Not uncertainty- Rio was never uncertain. This was fear. A ridiculous, fleeting panic that Sage might flinch again.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn't flinch. She didn’t move at all. But Agatha immediately noticed the dark clouds outside begin to roll in. Still, Rio had already hesitated, and now her hand was stuck midair like she had forgotten what she was doing. Instead of retreating like a normal person, she made it worse. She gave the air near Sage’s head a few stiff, uncomfortable pats, as if she were blessing her with some unseen magic. As if that was normal.</p><p> </p><p>Then, realizing how absurd she must’ve looked, Rio panicked further and dragged her palm down an invisible line in front of Sage’s face, miming some strange, touchless caress like she was performing a blessing at a church neither of them belonged to.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned at herself and stalked off toward the backyard, leaving Sage standing there, watching her go with the same deadpan stare as a teenager who had just witnessed their mother try and fail to use slang.</p><p> </p><p>At first, it almost seemed funny. But the longer Agatha sat with it, the more it pressed down on her. Rio was still struggling to find her place with Sage, still unsure of where she stood as her mother. They were on opposite sides of something neither of them knew how to bridge. It was not them. It was careful. Strained. Like watching two people who should have known each other inside and out but were stuck pretending otherwise.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snapped her book shut and thumped it against her forehead a few times, trying to knock the thought away and failing. If Agatha were still alive, she was certain she would’ve rattled her brain into a concussion by now with the number of head banging moments she had been forced to endure.</p><p> </p><p>She heard Sage step into the living room, catching a glimpse of her moving past the couch on her way to the study.</p><p> </p><p>“If you bring a math workbook anywhere near me, I will not hesitate to beat you with it,” Agatha said, not bothering to look up.</p><p> </p><p>Sage immediately corrected course, pivoting on her heel and making a sharp U-turn back to the couch.</p><p> </p><p>Day 9:</p><p> </p><p>Agatha heard Rio yelling from the kitchen. There was panic in her wife’s voice, real and unfiltered, which was enough to send Agatha running. She skidded to a stop, taking in the scene.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was on top of the counter, pressed so far into the corner beneath the floating cabinets it was a wonder she hadn’t phased through the wall. A spatula was clenched in her hand, pointed downward like a weapon. Rio looked genuinely horrified.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha followed the spatula’s aim and immediately understood why.</p><p> </p><p>Brucie had Rio cornered, hissing violently, lunging at her despite the fact that she was well out of reach. Brucie did not seem to care. She was relentless.</p><p> </p><p>“Get back!” Rio shouted, jabbing the spatula toward her with the conviction of a knight defending a castle. “Get back!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barked Brucie’s name, snapping at her to fuck off.</p><p> </p><p>To both women’s shock, Brucie actually listened. She stilled, turned away from Rio without a second thought, and slithered straight toward Agatha instead. As the snake passed, she brushed against Agatha’s foot in a way that felt almost affectionate before disappearing as if nothing had happened.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood frozen, jaw slack, staring after Brucie like she had just witnessed a miracle.</p><p> </p><p>Brucie -Sage’s familiar, who despised everything and everyone that was not Sage- not only listened to Agatha but showed her affection.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked up at Rio, still processing what had just happened. Rio, however, looked wrecked. Her expression twisted, her hurt laid bare. Still perched on the counter, she slammed the spatula into the sink with a loud clang and jumped down in the same motion. Without a word, she stormed past Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha called after her, but it was useless.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Day 12: </p><p> </p><p>It was no longer a question. Whatever illusion of choice Sage had left them was gone, stripped away with the same precision she had used to set the stage. Agatha wasn’t just realizing it. She was standing in the middle of it, seeing the full extent of what their daughter had been constructing all along.</p><p> </p><p>Sage wasn’t only trying to make Agatha choose her to hurt Rio, to even the score. That was only one move in a much larger, more intricate game. If Agatha sided with Sage, Rio would fracture even further, pushed closer to the breaking point until she finally caved to what Sage was after. If Agatha chose Rio instead, it wouldn’t end the game. It would just give Sage more reason to dig in deeper. She would tell herself she had been abandoned, use it to justify whatever came next.</p><p> </p><p>This had actually never been about a single decision.</p><p> </p><p>Sage had been playing the long game before Agatha even realized that there was even a game to be played. Shifting the pieces where she wanted, maneuvering her and Rio into positions where every outcome led back to Sage, and all without them ever questioning how they got there. For a week and some change, Rio had been breaking under the heaviness of it, and Agatha, who had spent centuries perfecting the art of control and seeing every angle before a move was made, had been too caught up in the wreckage to notice.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t about stealing a title. Sage wasn’t forcing Rio to let go. She was breaking her apart piece by piece, wearing her down until keeping her title no longer felt like power. It felt like mercy. A final act of acquiescence that wouldn’t be taken from Rio, but willingly given. Not because her wife wanted to, but because she would believe she had to. It would feel inevitable. </p><p> </p><p>Their daughter was waiting for the moment where Rio would be desperate enough to beg for forgiveness. Desperate enough to do whatever it took to earn it.</p><p> </p><p>Desperate enough to surrender Death.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had walked right into it without realizing.</p><p> </p><p>And it was fucking foolproof. Every move precise, every shift inevitable. If Agatha hadn’t been so goddamn furious, she might have been impressed.</p><p> </p><p>The realization hit like stepping out of a hex, the kind that lingers even after it’s broken. It clung to her, disorienting and inescapable, leaving Agatha to wade through the aftermath of something she hadn’t even realized she was under. Before she could think better of it, Agatha was already moving. She took the stairs two at a time, each step feeding the anger curling in her gut. By the time she reached Sage’s door, she didn’t bother knocking. She threw it open with enough force to rattle the frame.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t react. She was at her desk, pencil in hand, twirling it lazily between her fingers. But what made Agatha’s stomach churn was the tune she was whistling. <em> The Ballad of the Witches’ Road. </em> Low and smooth, like she had all the time in the world. She didn’t turn around immediately, just let the melody drag out before finally spinning her chair to face Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha weren’t on a mission, she might have stopped in her tracks at the color of Sage’s eyes. They were still green, but something about them was off. The vibrance was drained, the life dimmed, and if Agatha looked closely, she could swear there was a ring of gray circling her pupils. Agatha couldn’t tell for sure, and honestly, right now, she didn’t particularly give a fuck.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s brows lifted in delight at the rage she found waiting for her. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha wouldn’t react. Wouldn’t give her the satisfaction.</p><p> </p><p>This was a game now. A long, premeditated one.</p><p> </p><p>Sage remained seated at her desk, exuding the kind of practiced indifference that might have been convincing if Agatha didn’t know better. Her daughter didn’t flinch, didn’t even have the courtesy to look surprised. Of course, she didn’t. This was an invitation, not an ambush. A silent acknowledgement that Agatha had finally caught up, that the opening moves were made, and now Sage was preparing for Agatha to take her seat at the players table.</p><p> </p><p>There was no arrogance in Sage’s posture, no gloating, nothing so clumsy as a smirk. Just patience. The confidence of someone who had invested time in arranging the board and was now waiting to see what Agatha would do with the knowledge she had just gained.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t sit.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t lean in, didn’t engage the way Sage wanted. She closed the space between them, stopping just short of touching her. Close enough to remind Sage exactly who she was playing against. Then she lifted a single finger, pointed it at her daughter, and said, <em> “Stop.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha would not plea. Would not reprimand. She made a move placed with accuracy.</p><p> </p><p>The pencil kept turning between Sage’s fingers, but her expression shifted just slightly, something almost imperceptible. The faintest flicker of reassessment. Not hesitation. Not doubt. Just even more calculation. The moment when a player registers an opponent’s move and recalibrates, adjusting their strategy to account for an unexpected shift on the board.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her ground, her face impassive, lifting her brow just enough to let Sage know exactly where they stood. <em> I see you. I know exactly what you’re doing. </em></p><p> </p><p>And more importantly.<em> I am not playing this game the way you expect me to. </em></p><p> </p><p>Then, without another word, Agatha turned and left, slamming the door behind her.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t call after her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Day 14: </p><p> </p><p>Two days passed before Agatha spoke a word of it to Rio. It wasn’t hesitation, nor was it uncertainty. She had seen Sage’s design with absolute clarity the moment she stepped out of that room, had understood the shape of it in a way that left no room for doubt. But knowing was one thing. Admitting it was another.</p><p> </p><p>To say it aloud would be to acknowledge the truth in its entirety- that their daughter had not simply fallen heir to her cunning but had refined it into something far more meticulous. Sage wasn’t just clever. She was methodical, patient in ways that Agatha had never been, tearing away choice under the guise of giving it. She wasn’t forcing Rio to yield; she was leading her there, carefully untwisting her until surrender felt indistinguishable from absolution.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha waited, stalling the moment she would have to look Rio in the eye and confirm it. But avoidance wouldn’t change the nature of what was happening, and her wife, of all people, deserved to hear it from Agatha rather than realizing it on her own.</p><p> </p><p>That night, as Agatha lay beside Rio, staring at the ceiling, she finally spoke. "It’s a game," Agatha said. The words felt heavier than they should have, like naming it gave it more power than it already had.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t ask what she meant. She didn’t even turn to look at Agatha. She took a slow breath, one that came not from realization but from something settled, something Rio had already accepted. "I know," Rio said, her voice quiet. "It’s in your fine print."</p><p> </p><p><em>Fucking ouch</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned at the simplicity of it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha realized that Rio had already seen it, not as a possibility but as a certainty, as inescapable as the roles they had both been playing without ever agreeing to the rules. She had recognized it before Agatha had, understood the rhythm of it in a way that suggested this wasn’t new to her.</p><p> </p><p>And, of course, it wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned her head, studying Rio’s expression in the dim light, searching for anything beneath that patience, some sign of frustration or anger, something to tell her that Rio hadn’t just accepted this without resistance. But there was nothing.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's wife had already braced for it, had already made peace with the truth long before was willing to speak it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had seen it in the way Sage moved her pieces, in the way she pushed without ever seeming to, in the way she had led them both exactly where she wanted them to be. Every refusal, every moment of resistance, had been another step toward Sage’s grandest scheme.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had been the last one to see it.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p>Day 17: </p><p> </p><p>It had been five days since Agatha understood the full extent of what Sage was doing and three since she had admitted it to Rio, though her wife had already seen it for what it was. Yet every morning, Rio woke with the same determination, ready to try again, as if persistence alone could undo what Sage had already set in motion. Rio ignored their daughter’s actions, refusing to acknowledge them, as if putting them into words would only cement them further. It didn’t seem to matter how much it chipped away at her or how it hollowed her out. The hope that Sage would eventually give in was the only thing keeping her going.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s wife and daughter were both chasing mirages, sustained by the illusion that if they just kept moving forward, they would eventually reach something real. But Agatha saw the truth- there was no prize at the end of this. Rio had let herself become a willing piece on a board Sage commanded, every move unfolding exactly as she planned. And yet, the game stretched on, an endless loop with no victor, as if neither of them could see that it was never meant to end, only to keep them playing.</p><p> </p><p>And all Agatha could do was sit there, biting her tongue and willing her frustration to settle. With each passing day, she felt that familiar chaos smoldering inside her, clawing at her ribs, creeping closer to a way out. It was getting stronger. She could almost smell the embers catching, threatening to ignite.</p><p> </p><p>But the fire never had a chance to spread.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had always been there. When the ghosts of chaos banged on the doors of Agatha’s chest, clawing to turn her ribs into ruins, when she no longer had the strength to hold them shut- Rio was there. Not just a shield, not just salvation. She was the ocean that surged through those haunted halls, sweeping away the darkness before it could consume Agatha whole.</p><p> </p><p>Though Rio would never confront the situation head on, she had her own way of pulling Agatha free, sweeping her up in distraction and drowning out the havoc before it could take hold. Sometimes that meant losing themselves in each other like a pair of horny teenagers, tangled up in stolen moments behind closed doors. Other times it was the thrill of sneaking around the house, exchanging teasing glances and whispered flirtations as if they weren’t already bound together. And sometimes it was just talking, about nothing in particular, letting one thought tumble into the next. The types of conversations that started with an offhand remark about the garden and somehow ended up unraveling the entire history of a forgotten spell or debating whether the moon ever got tired of watching over the world. Anything to pull Agatha away, to remind her that not everything had to be a battle.</p><p> </p><p>It was always just enough. Enough to wake up the next day, enough to let herself be pulled into whatever ridiculous scheme Sage had concocted, enough to keep moving forward. It gave Agatha a reason to hold back, to stay on the sidelines instead of diving headfirst into the mess Sage was making. Getting involved would only make things worse for Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha refused to play Sage’s game. So she feigned ignorance with the confidence that only came from lifetimes of deception. She pretended she had never pieced it together, never seen the pattern, never recognized the same ruthless deviousness in her daughter's eyes that once lived in her own. As if she wasn’t staring into a mirror of the past. As if she didn’t see Sage tearing them apart, tearing Rio apart bit by bit with every passing day.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha had never been as patient as Rio, and now, apparently, Sage. Her patience was thinning, stretched to its limits. Agatha was restless, ready to act, to say something, to bring it all out into the open. More than anything, she wanted to talk to her wife, to hear Rio say she was okay after enduring Sage’s relentless attacks, one after another.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could see the strain pressing into Rio’s posture, the subtle shifts in her demeanor. It was affecting her, no matter how unshaken she tried to appear. And yet Rio stood firm, treating it like it was just another bump in the never ending road of Sage’s bullshit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had tried. She had given Rio every opportunity to talk, to work through it together, to find some kind of solution before this shitshow spiraled any further. She had approached it carefully at first, then more directly when Rio brushed her off, but no matter how Agatha framed it, Rio refused to engage. Her wife deflected, changed the subject, acted as if there was nothing to discuss. Until tonight, in what could only be described as sheer, childish behavior, Rio stormed out of their bedroom and threw herself onto the couch dramatically, draping an arm over her face as if the weight of the world had forced her there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t entertain Rio’s tomfoolery for a fucking second.</p><p> </p><p>She followed, grabbed Rio by the front of her shirt, and hauled her up with enough force to send her staggering. Before Rio could collect herself, Agatha shoved her right back toward their bedroom, shut the door behind them, and let her temper take over. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s words cut through whatever ridiculous pretense Rio had been clinging to. This wasn’t a game they played anymore. This wasn’t a battle of wills she was going to entertain. If Rio ever pulled this stunt again, Agatha would personally build her a doghouse, board by board, and she could sleep in it indefinitely. Maybe forever, if Rio was foolish enough to test it twice.</p><p> </p><p>Rio never tested it again.</p><p> </p><p>Day 19:</p><p> </p><p>Today, Rio had stormed into the living room, an open laptop in one hand, and without a word, snatched the remote from Agatha before switching the input on the TV. Neither Sage nor Agatha reacted, only watching in silence as Rio connected a cable from the laptop to the screen. A manila folder sat on top of the keyboard, its contents unknown.</p><p> </p><p>Outside, the sunlight that had flooded the room only moments ago disappeared, swallowed by a sudden blanket of clouds. It was always like this- clear skies until Rio came within five feet of Sage, and then, without fail, the light vanished. Another unspoken message. A reminder. The endless sunshine only proved that Sage wasn’t suffering the way Agatha knew Rio was, that she was untouched by the damage she was causing.</p><p> </p><p>It was fucking mean. It was so ugly. And Agatha wasn’t sure how much more of this she could take.</p><p> </p><p>They watched as Rio navigated through her files with ease, opening a PowerPoint presentation without so much as a glance in their direction. A moment later, the first slide filled the screen, its title bold making it impossible to ignore:</p><p> </p><p>"The 25 Greatest Moments of Agnes O’Connor’s Reign of Terror: A Deep Dive into Westview’s Local Reddit and Neighborhood Watch Facebook Page- Ranked from Mildly Amusing to Absolutely Legendary."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Twenty five seemed… excessive. Ten, maybe fifteen instances would have been reasonable, but twenty five? That felt like overkill. Then again, if Rio had taken the time to make a whole PowerPoint about it, Agatha had the sinking feeling this was only the highlight reel.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had even included footnotes and an aggressive color coded rating system in the presentation.</p><p> </p><p>Sage let out a snort, barely stifled, and Agatha nearly wrenched her own neck trying <em> not </em> to turn and confirm it had actually happened.  Instead, she forced herself to keep her gaze on the ridiculous, infuriatingly gorgeous woman in front of her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw the moment it registered. Rio didn’t whip her head up or let her expression crack with shock. But she did glance up, a quiet shift pulled by instinct alone. Her eyes flicked to Sage, and for the briefest moment, a smile ghosted across her lips. Small, fleeting, but it was there.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t giddy, wasn’t triumphant. Just… relief. Like hearing that single, unguarded sound had filled Rio in some quiet way, had given her just enough fuel to keep moving forward. As if it had reminded her that something was still there, no matter how buried, no matter how brief.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let the moment slip away without a word, turning back to the screen like it had never happened. But Agatha felt it linger, warm and aching in her chest. It melted through every part of her, leaving only the love that had never once let go.</p><p> </p><p>Rio grabbed the manila folder and strolled toward Agatha, holding it out with a smirk. “I took the liberty of printing a physical copy for the lovely lady who struggles to read words on any type of screen.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snatched it from her hand with a scoff. “I’m dead. My vision is perfect now, thank you<em>.</em>”</p><p> </p><p>Rio, unfazed, dropped into the armchair, laptop settling onto her lap as she clicked to begin. She read the title slide aloud, then giggled to herself- clearly amused by her own cleverness. Agatha, on the other hand, thought it was less clever and more idiotic<em>. </em></p><p> </p><p>Still, she didn’t protest. Because, despite herself, she was curious. And she was absolutely staying for the show.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tapped the trackpad, and the next slide appeared- a hilariously blurry, poorly cropped profile picture of Agnes O’Connor, taken from the least flattering angle possible. She wasn’t smiling, wasn’t even scowling, just staring blankly at the camera with the lead poisoned expression of a sixty year old male divorcé who had just discovered dating apps and was way too confident about messaging women half his age.</p><p> </p><p>Rio burst out laughing. Agatha groaned. And out of the corner of her eye, Agatha could have sworn she saw Sage’s lip twitch.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Okay. Not a bad start. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio clicked to the next slide, barely getting through the first word before Sage cut her off.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to do this,” Sage said flatly, arms crossed tight over her chest, her entire posture suddenly radiating irritation.</p><p> </p><p>Both Agatha and Rio snapped their heads toward their daughter, caught off guard.</p><p> </p><p>Neither Agatha nor Rio spoke. They only stared at Sage, waiting for the punchline. This was exactly the kind of thing she would normally enjoy. If anything, Agatha was surprised Sage hadn’t already compiled PowerPoint complete with her own annotations and a dramatic reading.</p><p> </p><p>But instead, Sage folded her arms tighter and sighed like this was the greatest burden ever placed upon her. “I don’t want to sit through this and watch you make fun of her.” She waved a lazy hand in Agatha’s direction, clarifying which her she meant.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her upper lip curled, one side lifting in disbelief. Her brows pulled in, her expression stuck frozen between offended and annoyed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, completely unfazed, just stared at Sage. “Are you serious?” She waved a hand at the screen. “This isn’t making fun of her. This is investigative journalism. This is important work.” She clicked to the next slide and pointed. “This is a real post from from a man who wrote, and I quote, ‘The unholy congregation of plastic lawn flamingos in Agnes O’Connor’s yard is a blight upon this town and a personal attack on my property value.’”</p><p> </p><p>Without missing a beat, Rio continued, “And that particular post? Agnes proceeded to engage in a twenty seven comment argument under it, passionately defending both her right to own flamingos and their aesthetic integrity- which, according to her, was something only ‘uncultured swine with no artistic sensibilities’ would fail to appreciate.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage exhaled sharply through her nose, her arms still crossed. Her expression was carefully cool, but Agatha caught the telltale signs of a potential losing battle- the twitch in her jaw, the way her gaze flickered downward for just a second too long.</p><p> </p><p>Then, despite her best efforts, the corner of her mouth betrayed her, tugging upward before she forced it back into place.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not funny,” she mumbled, her voice flat, but there was the slightest shake to it, just enough to betray her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, smelling blood in the water, leaned forward, eyes locked onto Sage with predatory instinct. “Don’t act like this is brand new,” she said. “We spent hours going through this. You laughed so hard at the ‘uncultured swine’ comment you lost consciousness.” Rio paused, their daughter didn’t break. “Sage, I had to check if you were still breathing.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s entire posture stiffened. Her fingers curled against her arms, nails digging in just enough to make her knuckles go white. The shift cracked, like a wire snapping under too much tension. Her head jerked toward Rio, eyes dark with something dangerously close to fury. “And?” she bit out, voice clipped. “What the hell is your point?”</p><p> </p><p>The air in the room changed, the humor drained from it entirely. Agatha’s muscles tensed, instinct kicking in before her mind even caught up. Sage wasn’t embarrassed. She wasn’t fighting back a laugh.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She was angry. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked over to Rio. Rio, completely unfazed, flicked her gaze toward Agatha before shifting back to Sage. Then, with an exaggerated roll of her eyes, she leaned back into the armchair and tossed a lazy hand in the air, an unimpressed invitation. Rio was silently telling Sage to <em> Go ahead. Get it out of your system. </em></p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t hesitate. She shot up from her seat, her voice exploding through the room before Agatha could even process it.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want to hang out with you!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grimaced like Sage had just said the dumbest shit imaginable. “Why not?” Rio asked, genuinely confused.</p><p> </p><p>A crack of thunder rattled the sky. Sage’s hands curled into fists at her sides, her breath ragged. “Take the fucking hint, Rio!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio winced. Not at the volume, not at the venom in Sage’s voice- <em> at her name. </em></p><p> </p><p>Sage pressed forward, voice shaking with pure unadulterated fury. “I don’t want to be around you. You’re acting like this is normal, like you’re normal.” Her breath hitched, her mouth twisting like the words tasted bitter.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not fucking normal, you’re-”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s what?” Agatha interrupted and was now on her feet, her tone daring. “Go on, Sage. Finish that sentence.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage did not.</p><p> </p><p>Since all of this started, hesitation flickered across Sage’s face. Agatha recognized it immediately, the slightest shift in the color of her eyes, the briefest crack in the performance. Finally. Beneath all the anger, beneath the instinct to wound before she could be wounded, was their Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Her shoulders sagged, just slightly. Her breath wavered for half a second. The rage had been carrying her, keeping her upright, pushing her forward, but now it was slipping. She looked like she had been waiting for someone to stop her, to pull her back before she went too far, before she said something she could never take back.</p><p> </p><p>Over the course of weeks, they had allowed Sage to throw her tantrum, to hone her words into weapons and wield them recklessly. They let her manipulate, let her test the limits of how much destruction she could cause, let her believe that if she burned everything down, she would somehow emerge victorious. Instead, all she was left with was the aftermath, the ruins of something never built to withstand time.</p><p> </p><p>It hadn’t. It never would, and it seemed like Sage was struggling to come to terms with that.</p><p> </p><p>And now, standing there, fists clenched, breathing uneven, their daughter was left with exactly what she had created. Nothing.</p><p> </p><p>To Agatha, this small victory tasted like honey.</p><p> </p><p>And then, just like that, Sage pulled herself back together. The hesitation vanished, the brief moment of vulnerability buried beneath the carefully crafted mask she wore so well.</p><p> </p><p>It was practiced. It was effortless.</p><p> </p><p>It reminded Agatha of Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fought the groan that threatened to escape her lips.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage,” Agatha said with a defeated sigh. “Walk away. Now.”</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, it looked like Sage might argue, might push back, just  might say something she wouldn’t be able to take back. But then, her nostrils flared, and she let out a sharp bark at Agatha before tearing her gaze away, storming upstairs toward her bedroom.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched her go, listened to the heavy slam of it behind her, then exhaled slowly through her nose.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back in the chair, blew out air through her teeth. She tilted her head toward Agatha, voice deceptively casual.</p><p> </p><p>“Well. That could have gone better.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and turned to Rio. In a mockingly sweet tone, she asked, “Oh, you really think so?”</p><p> </p><p>“I spent six hours on this PowerPoint,” Rio mumbled. “Feels like a waste not to finish it.”</p><p> </p><p>Great. Classic Rio deflection. A distraction, carefully wrapped and handed to Agatha like a peace offering, meant to make everything feel a little less suffocating. And right now, Agatha didn’t hate the idea of taking it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a long groan before dropping back onto the couch, “Well, get on with it.”</p><p> </p><p>For a little while, they forgot. Agatha laughed. Rio did too. The sounds were real, even if the silence of the empty space in the room still was unmistakably loud. It didn't go away. It didn’t lessen.</p><p> </p><p>But for now, they let themselves pretend.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Day 20:</p><p> </p><p>Another night passed, dragging behind it the remnants of another day that had chipped away at what little patience Agatha had left. Rio lay beside her, flat on her back, unmoving, staring at the ceiling as if she could will herself into another reality. Rio didn’t sigh, didn’t fidget, didn’t even shift, but Agatha could tell. She could feel the exhaustion in the stillness, and it went deeper than the body, it had seeped into her wife’s soul.</p><p> </p><p>Then, so softly it almost slipped past Agatha, Rio spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“When we were on our… two century break,” Rio mumbled, each word slow, pulling them from somewhere distant. “The worst part was thinking I was forgetting the sound of your voice. Wishing, desperately, to hear it again, even if it was cruel.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing. The words pressed against her heart, tightening around something she had, until now, thought was impenetrable.</p><p> </p><p>Rio continued, “I would have done anything just to have you be angry at me. To my face. Just to hear you say something, because even that was better than silence. Even that was better than you hiding from me.” She exhaled slowly, but it did nothing to mask the anguish Agatha knew was coming next. “Forgetting the sound of your voice was far worse than anything you ever did to me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio took another breath, deeper this time. Then, after a long stretch of silence, she admitted, “But if this is anything like what that would have been… I’d like to think I wouldn’t have begged a god I know isn’t real for it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had never believed in gods. Agatha knew this. The green witch had no use for them, no illusions about what lay beyond. Rio was Death herself, the final certainty, the one who answered when prayers went unheard. </p><p> </p><p>And yet, Death had still prayed. Every single day.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart didn’t just break- it shattered, splintering apart so violently that she could feel every jagged piece tearing through her. The pain was excruciating, something she was sure that was beyond what the body was meant to endure. It felt like glass grinding into bone. It clawed up her throat, a scream so blood curdling that Agatha had to choke it back before it escaped, had to force herself to stay still when every part of her wanted to collapse beneath the agony of it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know what to say. What could she say? That she was sorry? That she had suffered too? That she wished she had done it differently? None of it would have mattered.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha reached for her instead, pulling Rio close, pressing a hand into her hair as quiet tears slipped down her wife’s cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>And beneath all of it- the sorrow, the regret, the things neither of them could change- Agatha felt something else begin to build.</p><p> </p><p>A cold, merciless wrath, deeper than anger, sharper than fury. This time, it did not burn, it hollowed. It coiled low in Agatha’s chest, not wild or reckless, but forbearing, twiddling its thumbs, shrewd. This was worse than frustration, worse than grief, worse even than the kind of rage that lashed out blindly.</p><p> </p><p>Because, at this point, Sage wasn’t just punishing Rio. She was taking a blade to an already open wound, carving into a past that had long since scarred over, rewriting it in real time with her own hands. She was forcing Rio to live it all over again, but this time, Agatha was here to see every second of it unfold. And what had once been regret, once been longing, once been pain, twisted into something far uglier.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha released a breath, but the feeling didn’t pass. It stayed, tightening its grip, feeding on the knowledge that this seemed like something she couldn’t fix with silence or feigned ignorance.</p><p> </p><p>There was nowhere for it to go. But if the time came, if Agatha could finally act…</p><p> </p><p>There would be nothing left standing in its wake.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Day 23:</p><p> </p><p>Very little in this world truly scared Agatha Harkness. She could count on one hand the things that had ever managed it.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, this. This state of the realm, the hushed and slow moving ruin creeping through it, unnerved Agatha in a way she couldn’t ignore. It was more than the physical decay, more than the way the air itself that was starting to stink. It was what this place had become, it reflected what it was doing to the two most important women in her life. The two who had settled the hunger and chaos- the insatiable Agatha Harkness, the grieving mother, the vengeful ex-wife, the scorned daughter of an abusive mother. The two who had given her something that no amount of knowledge, no branch of science or psychology, no so called professional could have ever provided. Stability. Purpose. A reason to stay.</p><p> </p><p>And now, Agatha was watching the very foundations of that stability collapse. The very foundations of herself. Her wife and her daughter. Crumbling before her eyes. Losing the parts of themselves that was only made possible by the other.</p><p> </p><p>This made the list. The short, exclusive list of things that scared Agatha Harkness absolutely shitless.</p><p> </p><p>But it had. From the very moment she opened her eyes this morning, the fear had already settled in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had felt the familiar tap against her ribs, that voiceless invitation from chaos, always lurking, always ready to swallow Agatha’s fear whole and turn it into pure devastation. Chaos was hungry. It was always hungry. It could make things feel smaller, easier to manage, easier to bear.</p><p> </p><p><em>Fuck chaos.</em> Agatha would let it starve.</p><p> </p><p>Even if it meant sitting in this fear, letting it press against her lungs, letting it take up space she had wanted so desperately to clear.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Neither Agatha nor Rio saw Sage for days. The sun still rose, bright and unbothered, stretching across an empty sky. But there was something artificial about it, something that felt just a shade off. If Agatha looked too long, she could swear the light carried the faintest green hue, a subtle stain over everything it touched. It bled into the walls, settled over the furniture, crept through the air like an infection. Even inside, the world seemed slightly wrong, like it had been painted over with colors that did not quite belong.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could smell it too. Faint, but growing. Something sour, something rancid. It wove itself into the air, threading beneath it was something festering, like fruit left too long on the branch, its sweetness turned sickly as it decayed from the inside out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was beginning to worry about her wife. Three weeks had passed since Sage set herself on this warpath, dismantling Rio with surgical precision. Each day, Sage found new ways to pull her mother apart, to sever her at the seams. And Agatha could see the toll it was taking. Rio’s face had thinned, her cheeks beginning to hollow. Dark circles gathered beneath her eyes, her hair falling longer, darker, untouched by the sun even though it constantly gleamed brightly. Rio was beginning to look like Death after a job well done.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t like it one fucking bit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha remembered the way Rio had once described it- imposter syndrome. The way she had struggled to separate herself from her title, to remember that she was more than what Death demanded of her. That she was still Rio, still a green witch, still a mother, still a wife. Still a person with the right to have thoughts and feelings beyond the role she had been given. But Lady Death didn’t come with room for humanity. Eternity threatened to swallow everything she was until there was nothing left but the burden of what she was meant to be.</p><p> </p><p>Rio seemed to be forgetting where she belonged in all of this.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha, for one, couldn’t stomach it anymore. She was sick and fucking tired of watching her wife serve as their daughter’s personal punching bag. Sick of Sage waiting for Rio to break when it was never going to happen. Sick of Rio sitting there, taking it, because she believed she had to. Because proving she could endure it, proving she could take whatever Sage threw at her, was the only response she seemed willing to give.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned away from the back patio, leaving behind the garden where her wife had buried herself in quiet labor.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t her Rio in the garden, though. Not the one Agatha knew. Rio was steady, a force that endured, that weathered, that refused to be swept away. She could be soft, could be kind, but she was never helpless. She gave, but never without reason, never to those who only sought to take. And yet here she was, pouring herself into the earth as if she could plant something inside of it to make up for what was being stripped from her. As if keeping her hands in the dirt could keep her from slipping away entirely.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew where Sage was. The girl had been in the front yard all morning, stretched out in the grass, unmoving, as if she had nothing better to do than exist in their periphery. Agatha had seen her there the moment she and Rio had stepped out of the bedroom, lingering.</p><p> </p><p>And for the first time in weeks, Agatha was done letting it fester.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha walked straight up to Sage, her shadow falling over her daughter's face. Sage’s eyes fluttered open at the sudden darkness, but there was nothing behind them. Those green eyes, once alight with mischief and boundless excitement, always carrying the glimmer of a thought just waiting to be spoken, were empty. Agatha had never seen anything like it before. It was unfamiliar. Jarring.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t even look green anymore. In the dim light, they seemed washed out, as if something had drained the color from them, leaving only a dull, lifeless gray.</p><p> </p><p>Without a word, Agatha lowered herself onto the grass beside her daughter. The ground was cold beneath her palms. She tried not to let it scare her. She couldn’t let it swallow her whole, so she redirected. Focused only on Sage’s shit behavior that Rio and Agatha had been subjected to for the last three weeks.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha let the silence settle between herself and her daughter, stretching long enough that it could be mistaken for peace. She gave them both that moment, a single breath of stillness, before she politely tore Sage apart.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tipped her head back, eyes tracing the sky like maybe it could ground her. She hardly felt the warmth of the it against her skin. It only reminded her how much time she had wasted beneath different skies, always moving, always running, always convincing herself that she could outrun what was inevitable.</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” Agatha mumbled, almost to herself, “I wasted three hundred years running from her. Hiding from her. Three hundred years I will literally never get back.” She swallowed, but it didn’t clear the tightness in her throat, “Do you know what that feels like? To lose time on such a massive scale and have nothing to show for it?” She turned her head to look down at Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Sage had no reaction, not even bothering to open her eyes after they had fallen shut when Agatha sat beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers dug into the grass, grounding herself against the slow frustration curling in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I do. And Rio certainly does,” Agatha said, she was barely holding back the anger simmering beneath it. “And here you are, playing the stupidest fucking game in the history of ever. For what? To help?” Agatha’s words came out dripping in sarcasm, the mockery as much for herself as it was for her daughter. “Because this? This isn’t helping.. Actually, it’s making everything so much worse. You’re wasting time we don’t have, pushing her, pushing me, forcing something that will never happen.” The anger built in her voice, but Agatha wasn’t shouting. “Not only that, you are acting like the biggest asshole on the planet while you’re doing it.” Agatha was almost impressed by how neutral she sounded, considering how fucking furious she is.</p><p> </p><p>“I get it. You had a plan. A big, brilliant plan where we could all live happily ever after and play make believe. Whatever. It’s cute.” Agatha exhaled, a scoff curling at the end of her words. “But it’s a fantasy and that’s all it’s ever going to be. You can’t beat a dead horse and drag it to water, expecting it to drink. And you sure as hell can’t torture your mother into changing her mind. That’s not how this works."</p><p> </p><p>Still nothing from Sage. No scoff. No eye roll. No biting remark telling Agatha to shut up and mind her own business. Just silence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stole a glance at her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s now dull gray eyes stared unblinking at the sky, narrowed like she was trying to will the sun to burn hotter, to swallow the faint green haze clinging to the air. But magic wouldn’t fix this. Power couldn’t rebuild what Sage had destroyed on purpose. The rage that made her feel invincible, that made her believe she could control the outcome of this mess, had crumbled in the face of time. Three weeks was nothing compared to Agatha’s record of three centuries.</p><p> </p><p>For all the ways Sage had tried to wield power like a weapon, she had never truly been raised for it. Rio had given Sage everything- every ounce of love, every sliver of warmth, every lesson wrapped in patience and care. Her wife had cradled their girl in gentleness, even when the world wasn’t gentle.</p><p> </p><p>It was easy to mistake Death for a cold, unfeeling force- something that only took, that had no capacity for love. A cosmic inevitability, an entity as indifferent as the void itself. Something to be feared, whispered about in cautionary tales, the kind that made children hide under their covers and sent grown men to their knees in prayer.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> What a fucking joke. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Death was soft in ways she had no business being, fragile in ways that made Agatha’s chest ache, a bleeding heart in a role that was never meant to have one. And for all her power, for all the things she was capable of, Rio had never been ruthless. Never been cruel. Never sought dominion over anything. She wasn’t made for war, and she sure as hell hadn’t raised their daughter to be.</p><p> </p><p>And now, watching Sage falter beneath the pressure of her own performance, Agatha felt an overwhelming amount of relief settle in her chest. Because for all the mistakes Sage had made, for all the damage she had done, Rio’s nature -achingly kind, stubbornly human in all the ways that mattered- had kept their daughter from being consumed by it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had to look away from Sage. Her heart, now nothing more than useless mush, felt too easily swayed, too detached against the way Sage's face tightened, her jaw clenching like it was the only thing holding her together. Her daughter’s eyes fluttered closed as she took a long, slow breath, like she was fighting to protect herself, grasping for the mask she so desperately needed to keep from feeling any of it.</p><p> </p><p>“What you’re doing is killing her, Sage.” Agatha’s voice was softer now, gentler. She wasn’t speaking in a literal sense, but it was killing Rio all the same, stripping away pieces of her humanity, making her question if any of this had ever been real. Or if this was some cruel punishment thrust upon Death by Fate, a reckoning for the sin of caring too much.</p><p> </p><p>“And it’s killing me,” Agatha admitted, even quieter now. “I can’t sit here and watch her lose herself and be okay with it. And you, of all people, shouldn’t be either.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha brought herself to look at Sage again. Her eyes were still closed, her face red and splotchy around her eyes and the corners of her top lip. Her brows were furrowed, and her teeth were digging into her bottom lip so hard it had split.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage.” Agatha said gently, trying to get her daughter to look at her. Sage only squeezed her eyes tighter.</p><p> </p><p>It reminded Agatha of Rio, and seeing so much of her wife in their daughter at this moment felt like standing against an advancing navy fleet, outgunned and overpowered, with nowhere to run. Any anger or frustration she had left melted away completely.</p><p> </p><p>She lifted a hand and brushed her thumb over the healed scar on Sage’s eyebrow, smoothing over it in one unhurried motion. The tension in Sage’s shoulders eased, and after a moment, she opened her eyes. Their stormy gray depths now carried small specks of green, traces of the color that once filled them, flickering like embers refusing to burn out.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re my daughter, and I love you, Sage,” Agatha murmured, her voice steady despite the weight behind it. “Even when you act like this. Even when you make it impossible. I still fucking love you.” She exhaled, “If you want to keep playing this game, I’ll play it.” Her gaze didn’t waver, her touch remained gentle.</p><p> </p><p>“And I will choose a side.”</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes remained on Sage’s, her thumb gliding over the scar with the tenderness of a mother comforting her child, shielding her from a potential blow she could not predict. Agatha hesitated, the next words catching in her throat, “But it’ll only make me the villain in your story, Sage.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha would play, but she wouldn’t play against her wife.</p><p> </p><p>And if that made her the villain in her daughter’s story, then so be it. She had been feared before. She had been hated, cursed, and called things far worse. And if the cost of protecting Rio was becoming the monster in Sage’s eyes, then it was a price Agatha was willing to pay.</p><p> </p><p>And of course, Rio would probably try to pull some noble, self sacrificing bullshit. God, Agatha hated those fucking speeches. They were like door to door salesmen- persistent, exhausting, and completely unwelcome. No matter how many times she rejected the pitch, there was always another knock, another attempt to sell her on some limited time martyrdom deal she never asked for. It didn’t matter how noble the cause or how tragic the discount- she wasn’t fucking buying. She had slammed that door centuries ago.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had expected anger from her daughter. She had braced for disappointment, for pain, for something to break between them that could never be repaired. But Sage only looked at her, her face half buried in the grass, her expression neither wounded nor surprised. She tilted her head up slightly, considering, and then the smallest smirk curled at the corner of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>"I told you," Sage said, her voice edged with something almost proud. "I always prefer the villains."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha should have felt sick at that. It should have been proof of her own failures, of all the ways she had just ruined her daughter. But it wasn’t. It wasn’t mockery or resentment or some bitter acceptance of the mother Sage had been given. It was just the truth. A fact that had never needed to be spoken because Sage had never expected anything else.</p><p> </p><p>Sage had always known the history that dripped from Agatha’s name, had understood the blood she carried on her hands. And it had never changed anything. She had never asked Agatha to atone for it, had never flinched away from the person she was, had never wished for a version of her that was easier to love.</p><p> </p><p>She had always known Agatha had the potential to hurt her, had always known there was a world in which she might not be chosen, and she had loved her anyway. Fully, without fear, without limits.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t unconditional love. It was knowing exactly what Agatha was capable of and never once looking away. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> Just like Rio. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Sage lay back in the grass, gray eyes on the sky, picking at the skin around her nails like she couldn’t stop. The gray had settled like a fog, and Agatha couldn’t tell where her daughter had gone inside of it.</p><p> </p><p>She brushed a few stray hairs from Sage’s face, gentle, like it might remind her daughter there was still someone watching. Still someone paying attention. But Sage didn’t look at her again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, the words finding their way out before she could think better of them. “It’s exhausting, isn’t it,” she asked quietly. “Being the villain.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage stilled, her fingers finally going still against her skin. She looked at Agatha, just for a second, her gray eyes as dull and distant as they had been for weeks.</p><p> </p><p>But something shifted. Not enough to name. Not enough to see if you weren’t looking for it.</p><p> </p><p>Sage bit the inside of her cheek and turned back to the sky, somewhere far enough away that Agatha couldn’t follow. Her daughter’s face stayed neutral, the same quiet mask she had been wearing, but after a long moment, she gave the faintest nod.</p><p> </p><p><b>“</b>When did you stop fighting for her?” Agatha asks. </p><p> </p><p>From the moment she met Sage, that was all the girl had done. Every word, every plan, every impossible idea had been for them. For Rio. To make Agatha see Rio as more than what the universe decided she was allowed to be. But somewhere along the way, it changed. Somewhere in the middle of saving them, Sage lost track of what she was saving. And now, looking at her, Agatha couldn't tell if Sage even remembered why she started.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s eyes dropped from the sky, but she didn’t look at Agatha. Her brow pulled tight, her jaw working like she was chewing on the words, trying to make them easier to swallow. She shook her head, slow at first, then sharper, as if she could shake the doubt out of herself before it settled.</p><p> </p><p>“I am fighting for her,” Sage said, though it sounded thinner than it should have, more like a reminder than a fact. “That’s what all of this is.” She gave a lazy wave of her hand, a vague gesture toward everything, as if the mess she’d made was supposed to explain itself. The laugh that slipped out next was weak, strained, barely there before it broke apart. She pressed her palm to her face, dragging it down roughly, like she could scrape the frustration off her skin. “I’m giving her an out,” she said, quieter now, as if the words were losing their shape the longer she held them. “I’m giving all of us an out.”</p><p> </p><p>And maybe Sage had believed that once. But Agatha wasn’t sure she believed it anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head. There wasn’t any anger left, just the quiet, sinking understanding of what Sage had convinced herself this was.</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t call it mercy if she’s the one paying for it,” Agatha said, and it almost hurt to say the truth out loud.</p><p> </p><p>Sage glanced at Agatha briefly, her eyes hard, but she didn’t say anything. Her focus quickly shifted back to her fingers, picking relentlessly at her cuticles.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but watch the way Sage’s hands trembled as they dug into the already raw skin. The nails pressed deeper, pulling at the torn edges repeatedly, as if that was the only thing Sage could control anymore.</p><p> </p><p>The shaking didn’t stop. It only grew worse, the tremors turning from nervous fidgeting into frantic, desperate picking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw the first tear fall, barely noticeable at first, but she couldn’t look away. She watched as Sage wiped it away harshly with the back of her hand, as if she could erase it entirely. Her lips pulled into a frustrated pout, and her brow furrowed deeply, like her own body had betrayed her in some unforgivable way.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s breath hitched in, sharp and tight. She was holding herself back, trying to breathe through it, but the tension was so thick that Agatha could see it clearly- Sage was suffocating under the weight of everything she was trying not to feel.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ve been holding your breath for so long,” Agatha couldn’t hide the sadness in her voice, the heaviness in the words.</p><p> </p><p>Sage inhaled sharply, a raw, wet gasp that seemed to tear through her from the inside. Agatha watched, helpless, as the breath seemed to shatter something in her daughter. It wasn’t just the way her chest heaved, desperate for air- it was as though the very act of breathing had become a violent undoing, as if each inhale was pulling her daughter apart. The sound of it was jagged, like a body being split open, each breath more painful than the last. It was physical, that rippling effect, as if the force of it would break her completely.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck!” The cry came out with a guttural rasp, cracking in the air, the sound of a dam finally collapsing under its own pressure. Agatha could see how the release tore through her- Sage’s body trembled as though she couldn’t quite contain the overwhelming wave of emotion, as if it were too much for her skin, her bones, her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel it, too- the way Sage was breaking apart and there was nothing she could do to stop it. Agatha couldn’t reach out, couldn’t offer comfort. Sage had to face this alone, had to sit in the unbearable weight of everything she had done, everything she had buried so deep. She had to let it break her, even if it shattered Agatha in the process.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned away, unable to look at the devastation in her daughter’s eyes, the rawness of the pain cutting deeper than any words could say. The sound of Sage’s wail echoed through her, and Agatha flinched at the ache it caused.</p><p> </p><p>Then, it began to rain- not the heavy deluge, but a steady, unrelenting fall. Agatha tilted her head up, allowing the cold drops to touch her skin, letting the sky’s sorrow mingle with her own. Agatha closed her eyes, absorbing the rain, letting it cool the heat inside her. She hadn’t realized how much she missed this- how long it had been since she felt the earth's grief so intimately. The rain tasted of loss, of mourning, of the grief that came from loving Death, knowing that Death was eternal while they would eventually fade. That was the way of things. She and Sage would end, but Death would always remain. And that was the most tragic truth neither of them could bear.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha understood then why her daughter’s eyes had changed, why the vibrant green had faded into gray. It had settled in her eyes instead, silent but inescapable, a storm caged behind glass.</p><p> </p><p>Sage had pulled everything into herself, and the sky had reflected the loss. Her emotions had never known privacy; they had always lived in the open, stitched into the wind, painted across the clouds, carried in every shift of the air. The sun had burned with her joy, the storms had raged with her anger, the rain had wept with her sorrow. She had never been able to hide from it, had never needed to- until then.</p><p> </p><p>If she let her emotions reach the sky, if she let them shape the air the way they always had, then Rio would have seen the truth. She would have seen that Sage wasn’t just playing a game, wasn’t just pushing her away out of cruelty. She would have seen that every word, every action, every calculated wound had been cutting into Sage just as deeply.</p><p> </p><p>And Sage couldn’t let her know that.</p><p> </p><p>So she had buried it, forced it down, pulled it inside herself where no one could reach. The sky had been her greatest betrayer, so she had silenced it, left it empty, stripped it of the emotions it had always carried for her. It was the only way she could keep up the lie that none of this hurt. That she wasn’t breaking too.</p><p> </p><p>But the sky had never been meant to keep Sage's secrets.</p><p> </p><p>It had resented the silence, the emptiness Sage had forced upon it. The air had been rancid, thick with something stagnant and wrong. The sun had shined, but it had carried no warmth. The faint green hue had bled into everything it touched, an unnatural stain in a world that had always breathed with her. The atmosphere had once been an extension of her, a reflection of everything she had felt, and now she had abandoned it. She had taken everything and left it hollow.</p><p> </p><p>The sky had been hers, and it had been grieving.</p><p> </p><p>The hue had faded, and the air felt unburdened. The sky had finally released what it had carried in silence.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Day 24:</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her daughter’s tug deep in her heart, as if Sage’s hand was physically reaching inside, pulling at her most tender strings. For a fleeting moment, Rio thought about letting Sage wait, entertaining a brief flash of pettiness. But making the women in her life suffer was never her strength. Never had been. It simply wasn’t in her, especially if it meant her own heartache in return. So, without much resistance, she caved.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped into the corridor, surrounded by the darkness of the aquarium after hours. Dim overhead lights cast a soft glow on the towering kelp forest exhibit, where strands of kelp swayed gently in the manufactured currents. The exhibit, designed to replicate the natural kelp forests of the ocean, was serene and mysterious in the quiet night. Fish of various sizes darted between the kelp fronds, their movements swift and silent, adding life to the shadowy green columns. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> The kelp forest exhibit had been the first place Sage set foot on the surface. Back then, Sage couldn’t get enough of the ocean. She found ways to tie it to everything, like if she could understand the sea, she might make sense of the rest of her life too. Rio hadn’t argued. They both needed the distraction. Rio had been devastated, barely holding herself together, and Sage- well, Sage was still trying to figure out why Agatha Harkness had done what she had. Everything felt heavy. Too much. Even the thought of the open ocean was suffocating. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> But Sage wanted it anyway. She wanted to get close to it, to dip her toes in before she gave herself over completely. So, this is where they came. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio thought it would be awkward, watching her daughter take those first steps into a world she’d never been allowed to touch. After two hundred years trapped in a realm, with only Rio for company, she expected Sage to move like a fish out of water- clumsy, uncertain, ready to bolt. But it was nothing like that. Sage stepped onto the earth like she’d been born to do it. Like the surface had been waiting for her. And all Rio could do was stand back and watch, realizing how wrong she’d been. Sage wasn’t just surviving up here. She belonged. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio spotted Sage sitting on a bench in the middle of the exhibit. She walked over and sat down, leaving a careful gap between them. Unsure if too close would be pushing it. Unsure if anything would.</p><p> </p><p>It was a strange feeling.. foreign, almost ridiculous. She’d known Sage her entire life, knew her better than anyone. Knew her moods, her tells, the way her mind worked. And now? Now she felt like she didn’t know her at all.</p><p> </p><p>It made her sick.</p><p> </p><p>Sage closed the distance, scooting in against Rio’s side like she’d done a thousand times before. She had always been like that, drawn to her mother, moving wherever Rio moved, as if the space between them didn’t belong. Rio could picture her as a kid, small and serious, curling up beside her with a book most grown adults would struggle to finish. But Sage had understood every word, correcting Rio when she got something wrong, like it was the easiest thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p>Neither of them reached out. They just sat there, shoulder to shoulder, watching the quiet drift of fish and kelp in front of them. It wasn’t much, but the closeness was enough. For now, just being there, breathing the same air, looking out at the same view, felt like a start.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re real chatty tonight,” Sage said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a breath of a laugh, rolling her eyes. “Didn’t want to scare you off,” she said, and for a second, it almost passed like nothing. Just the usualness of<em> them.</em></p><p> </p><p>“Poor choice of words,” Sage mumbled, but when she looked over, Rio wasn’t prepared.</p><p> </p><p>It hit all at once. Green was back. Not fading in, not halfway there. It was all of it, clear and bright and impossibly familiar. Like it had never left.</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t look away. There was too much history in that color. Too much of the girl who used to trail behind her, wide eyed and brilliant, too much of the life they’d built before everything broke.</p><p> </p><p>Rio managed to breathe it out, barely. “Your green,” she whispered. “I missed it, Petal.”</p><p> </p><p>The last time Sage’s eyes had gone gray was the day Rio pulled her from Agatha’s side, the day the Darkhold sunk its teeth in and didn’t let go for nearly three centuires. Everything had rotted after that. The realm. The sun. The air itself. The ground beneath their feet. For days, the world around them had felt as hollow as the look in Sage’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> For days, Rio did everything she could to put Sage back together. She tried to force normal into the cracks, held her too tightly, watched her every second, waiting for the green to return like it was something she could will back into place.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> But it didn’t. </em>

<em> Not until the night she stopped trying to fix it. The night she held Sage close, not like something broken, but like a child who was simply hers. The night she stopped whispering promises that things would get better and just let the two of them sit there, quiet and worn out from surviving. Even as an infant, too small to understand what had been taken from her, she’d felt the ripping of it, the loss, the fear that clung to them both. It lived in her body before she even had words for it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> That night, Rio’s favorite shade of green came back like it had been waiting for the world to calm down long enough to return. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio only realized Sage was talking when the words started spilling out fast, like she’d been holding them back too long and now couldn’t stop.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry. I’m really sorry,” Sage said, her voice shaky, like she wasn’t sure if it even mattered anymore. “I know I was being awful. I knew it while I was doing it, and I just... I kept going. I thought it would help, I thought it would make things better or fix... I don’t know. I don’t even know what I thought. But it didn’t. It felt horrible. And I know I was horrible. And you didn’t deserve any of it.”</p><p> </p><p>She glanced over like she couldn’t stand to keep looking for too long, like she wasn’t sure if Rio was still there in the way that mattered.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Sage rushed out, like maybe saying it fast enough would fix the rest. “I love you so much. I don’t want to do that again. I won’t do it again. I swear. I’m so sorry, Mom. Please.”</p><p> </p><p>And the last word hung there, soft and desperate, like what she really meant was <em> please still love me </em>.</p><p> </p><p>It hit Rio like a punch to the gut, knocking the air clean out of her lungs. The apology mattered (of course it did) but the thought of Sage believing there was even a chance she’d gone too far, that she’d crossed some line Rio couldn’t forgive, was unbearable.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t get it. She never had. There was nothing she could do to lose her mother. Rio didn’t care how cruel the words had been, how sharp the edges got, how deep Sage had cut trying to get her way. She didn’t give a damn about any of that. She would always show up. Always.</p><p> </p><p>Because Sage wasn’t just her daughter. She was her person.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a shaky breath, the kind that barely made it past her ribs. She scrubbed a hand down her face, trying to pull herself together, but it didn’t help. None of it helped.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you too, Petal,” Rio said, and the words came out rough. Not because she didn’t mean them, but because she meant them too much. “And I’m sorry. For all of it. For not... handling things better. For the things I said. For letting it get this bad. For making you feel like you had to fight just to get me to listen.” She looked at Sage then, really looked. The green back in her eyes. The same face she’d loved since the moment she first held her, and somehow still, in this moment, it felt like seeing her for the first time again. Like getting something back she thought she'd already lost.</p><p> </p><p>It gutted her.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said again, quieter this time. “I hate that I made you feel like you had to carry all of this on your own.” And she did. God, she did. If Rio could’ve taken all of it off Sage's shoulders and dragged it into the ground herself, she would’ve. Without thinking twice. But some things didn’t work that way.</p><p> </p><p>She let the silence stretch, like maybe if she waited long enough, the next part wouldn’t hurt so bad to say. But it did.</p><p> </p><p>It always did.</p><p> </p><p>“But I still can’t give you what you want,” she said. “I won’t,” Rio swallowed hard, eyes back on the glass in front of them.</p><p> </p><p>“I know why you did what you did. I get it now. And I’m sorry that you thought you had to try so hard to take it from me. I’m sorry you thought you needed to.” She shook her head slowly, breath unsteady again, “But I’m still not letting go. And I love you so much that I hope... somehow, you can live with that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio saw it the second it hit- how the hope in Sage’s eyes flickered out like a light snuffed between her fingers. Before she could even think of what to say, Sage turned away, locking her focus on the slow sway of kelp behind the glass. Her brow pulled tight, and Rio caught the shine in her eyes, the way she blinked a little too fast, like she could will the tears away if she just kept staring straight ahead.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s fine,” Sage muttered, her voice rough and uneven. She tilted her head slightly toward Rio, just enough to show the words were meant for her, though her eyes never left the tank.</p><p> </p><p>For a moment, it seemed like that was all she was going to say. But then Sage exhaled, sharp and tired, and kept going.</p><p> </p><p>“You didn’t even try to listen,” she said. “Didn’t ask why. You just got angry. Decided I was being selfish. Some reckless kid who doesn’t know what she’s talking about, like I haven’t been standing right beside you through all of this. Like I haven’t spent my whole life watching it happen.” And there wasn’t any bite left in it. No fight. Just the worn out truth of someone who already knew how the conversation was going to end.</p><p> </p><p>It hit Rio hard, settling deep in her chest until she had to swallow to keep it from choking her. She shifted where she sat, cleared her throat, and said, “I’m sorry, Petal. You can tell me. I won’t get angry. I promise.” And she meant it. Every word.</p><p> </p><p>But she couldn’t promise she wouldn’t want to throw up hearing it. Because she already knew. Of course she did. Conversations like this had happened before, back when it was her wife sitting across from her. Back then, Rio had shut it down before it could go anywhere. It was always too painful. Too impossible.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had seen every horror death had to offer. Every terrible ending. Every nightmare anyone could imagine. None of it compared to this.</p><p> </p><p>Because this time, it was Sage.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio knew no matter how carefully her daughter said it, no matter how calm the words came out, she was still going to have to say no. And for the first time since she first held Sage in her arms, she was going to have to mean it.</p><p> </p><p>Sage swallowed, her eyes never leaving the fish as they moved through the kelp, like watching them might steady her. “You’re not in a garden,” she said softly. “You are in a store. A single stemmed rose reaching out for more.”</p><p> </p><p>First thought: <em>fucking ouch.</em></p><p> </p><p>Second thought: <em>deflect.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio let out an awkward huff of a laugh. “I’m not Agatha. You don’t have to talk to me in riddles.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage scoffed under her breath, fingers twisting in her lap. They were picked raw, the skin jagged and torn. Rio wanted nothing more than to take her hands and smooth them down, to fix what she could, but she stayed still. Sage wasn’t done.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not a riddle,” she said. “It’s a song. But that’s not the point.” She shifted slightly, but her eyes stayed on the water. “You don’t deserve this. Eternity. Being trapped in it. It’s not fair. You never even got a choice. And it’s... it’s fucked up. You’re just stuck.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. Because, honestly, Sage wasn’t wrong.</p><p> </p><p>Once, a long time ago, she would’ve given anything to be part of the cycle she’d spent forever watching. She wanted to live and die like everything else did. To be held by the dirt, to bloom and wither and leave something small behind. She wanted the good and the terrible, all of it. To have a family. To love someone so much it tore her apart. To lose and claw her way back together just to prove she could. To feel the weight of time on her bones. To grow old. To fall asleep and not wake up.</p><p> </p><p>To belong to the earth the way everything else did. </p><p> </p><p>But that had never been hers to have.</p><p> </p><p>And hearing Sage say it out loud felt like being reminded of something Rio had spent years trying not to want.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve learned to live with it, Sage,” Rio said, her voice low. She meant it. It wasn’t some bitter admission. It was the truth. Living with it was all she had left. She’d been carrying eternity long before Sage was born, long before Agatha ever spoke her name, and there was no version of this where she would hand that to anyone else. Not her daughter. Not the people she loved. This was hers. It had always been hers.</p><p> </p><p>Sage huffed a quiet, sharp breath, shaking her head. “Yeah. Well. It’s not natural.”</p><p> </p><p>When Sage looked over at Rio, there wasn’t just frustration behind her eyes. The words weren’t just thrown out in passing. It was a deliberate dig, meant to hit exactly where it did.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, of all people, worshipper of the cycle, keeper of the balance. Always the first to talk about the way things were meant to end. And here she was, still sitting at the center of it all, hoarding the one thing that was never supposed to last.</p><p> </p><p>Rio opened her mouth to tell her daughter to stop, to end this before either of them said what didn’t need saying, but Sage didn’t give her the chance.</p><p> </p><p>“I can’t outrun you forever,” Sage said. The words weren’t loud, but they didn’t need to be. They cut clean, like they’d been waiting on her tongue for years.</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt it everywhere. In her chest. In her stomach. Somewhere deep behind her ribs, where she’d already been bruised heavily by this same thought more times than she could count.</p><p> </p><p>Sage kept going, her voice tightening, shaking in places, but determined. “I’m going to die. Agatha will move on. And you’re still going to be here. Alone.”</p><p> </p><p>The first tears slid from Sage’s eyes, heavy and quick, falling straight down and disappearing into the fabric of her shirt.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached out without thinking, brushing her thumbs across Sage’s cheeks like she had when she was little. Back when there were problems Rio could actually fix, hurts she could take away. </p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t pull back. She let her.</p><p> </p><p>But even as Rio dropped her hands, she felt the weight of what Sage wasn’t saying.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re going to forget,” Sage whispered. “You already have. Whoever you had before us... whatever family you loved before Agatha, before Nicky.. Before me... they’re gone. You don’t even remember them anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>And the worst part was, Sage was right… <em>again.</em></p><p> </p><p>Rio <em> felt </em> it sometimes, just out of reach. A name she couldn’t hold onto. A laugh she thought she once knew. The shape of someone’s face in a dream that disappeared as soon as she opened her eyes. Maybe it was family. Maybe it wasn’t. But there had been people once. Before all this. Before the centuries ground them down into nothing. And whatever pieces of them were left, Rio had already lost.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t want that for you,” Sage said. “I don’t want you to forget. I don’t want you to be the only one left. We won’t forget you. I won’t. And thinking about you staying here, after all of us are gone, carrying this alone... it makes me sick.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio listened. Really listened. She heard every word, felt every bit of it lodge deeper than she cared to admit.</p><p> </p><p>But none of it changed the truth.</p><p> </p><p>This was hers to carry.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And it always would be. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept her eyes on the glass, watching the fish weave through the kelp, giving herself a minute before she spoke. It felt too big to rush.</p><p> </p><p>“You know,” she said quietly, “I still remember the first time you cried. Really cried. Not because you were hungry or tired, but because you knew something hurt. You were barely old enough to stand. And I held you, and I thought... this is it. This is what people mean when they say their heart breaks. Because I would’ve given anything to take it from you. To hold all of it so you wouldn’t have to feel a second of it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head and gave a small, humorless laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“And I thought that was the worst of it. That moment. That tiny little heartbreak. I didn’t know how much bigger the hurt could get. How much worse it would feel to watch you grow up and keep hurting anyway. And I’ve spent every day since trying to figure out how to keep the sharpest parts away from you. Even knowing I can't.”</p><p> </p><p>She paused and looked at Sage, making sure she was really listening.</p><p> </p><p>“And now you’re sitting here worried about me,” Rio said. “Worried about what it’s going to do to me when you're gone. Like you’re some burden I’m going to have to carry.”</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in slightly, her voice dropping low.</p><p> </p><p>“But Petal, that’s never what this was. You’re not something I’m stuck with. You’re the reason any of this means anything at all. And yeah, I’ll still be here when it’s over. That’s how this works. But don’t you dare think that means I’m left with nothing. You’ve already given me everything worth holding onto. And I don’t care how much time passes. That doesn’t leave me. You don’t leave me. You’re part of me now. In ways nothing can wear down, not even this.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat back, looking up at the shifting lights above them.</p><p> </p><p>“So no, I don’t want to trade places. I don’t want out. I want to be here. I want to see it all. The whole mess of it. Every version of you. Every day you’re here. It’s not some tragedy for me, getting to watch the people I love live their lives. It’s the whole reason I stay. I stay so you don’t have to. That’s my job. That’s always been my job.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let the words hang there, not needing to push them any further.</p><p> </p><p>For once, Sage didn’t argue.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>By the time they made it home, the sun was climbing, casting soft golden light across the garden. The air was fresh, still damp from the night, like the whole world had taken a deep breath. Agatha sat on the patio with a cup of coffee, watching them move through the morning like it was any other day, like it had always been this easy.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was already out in the dirt, wearing green coveralls with <em> VIDAL </em> stitched across the front, one of Rio’s old sets she’d stolen years ago and refused to give back. It was practically falling off her shoulders, her boots caked in mud, hair a mess, a streak of soil across her cheek like a badge of honor.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was crouched a few feet away, weeding near the pond, and Agatha could hear the sigh from across the garden before Rio even spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m serious, Petal. The koi are too fat.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage looked up like Rio had just personally insulted her entire bloodline.</p><p> </p><p>“Excuse me? Don’t say that about them! They’re perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio snorted. “Perfectly fat.”</p><p> </p><p>“They’re robust.”</p><p> </p><p>“They are the size of toddlers.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage dropped her clippers into the dirt, “Maybe they’re bulking. Maybe they have goals.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pointed accusingly toward the water, “You’ve been sneaking them extra food. Don’t lie to me.”</p><p> </p><p>“I haven’t!” Sage said, absolutely lying. “They’re just... thriving under my care.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat back on her heels, wiping sweat from her forehead. “Thriving? Sage, one of them got stuck under a lily pad yesterday. Had to reverse out like a car in a tight parking lot.”</p><p> </p><p>“They have big personalities. And you know what? I hope they get bigger.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re trying to kill them with kindness.”</p><p> </p><p>“Better than starving them with your negativity.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t hold back the laugh this time, sipping her coffee as the two of them kept going, voices overlapping with nonsense and love and something that finally felt light.</p><p> </p><p>And for the first time in longer than she could remember, Agatha let herself believe it was real.</p><p> </p><p>They were home. They were whole. And they were going to be just fine.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>For as long as there have been endings, there has been Rio Vidal. Before the first tide reached the shore, before the mountains settled into their shapes, before the sky remembered its name, she was already waiting. It is by her hands that the last light is dimmed. It is by her will that the door is closed. She is not a story told by those who fear the dark. She is the dark itself, patient and certain, carrying the quiet knowledge that all things end, and all things return.</p><p> </p><p>Empires crumble. Rivers dry. Names are forgotten. Time leans forward and takes what it is owed. Through all of it, Rio endures.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, endurance has never been the same as immunity.</p><p> </p><p>There are roots older than the earth that grip without mercy. There are bonds formed so completely they leave no part untouched. Love, in its oldest form, does not ask permission before it takes hold. It does not concern itself with what should or should not bend. Even the endless must answer to what has been woven into their keeping. There is no logic to it. No rule written to account for the weight of love pressed into the spaces meant to hold only silence.</p><p> </p><p>It is easy to believe that Death does not yield. Easier still to believe she was never meant to. But there are quiet shifts, small and certain, that begin long before they are noticed.</p><p> </p><p>And already, beneath the surface, something has started to give.</p><p> </p><p> </p>

<em> Sage Vidal had known Agatha Harkness her whole life, or at least as much as anyone could know a mother they’d never met. Rio made sure of that. The good. The bad. The brilliant, impossible parts that made people stay, and the jagged, selfish parts that made them leave. By the time Sage was old enough to understand what had been taken from her, it didn’t feel like absence. It felt like theft. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Sage wanted the life she should’ve had- the one where Agatha wasn’t just a story passed down in pieces, where her mothers weren't locked in some endless, miserable stalemate, ruining each other from opposite sides of the same grief. She wanted something simpler. A life where knowing Agatha wasn’t a fight, where love wasn’t something both of her mothers seemed determined to lose on principle. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It was clear Rio wasn’t going to do a fucking thing about it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Not when her mother spent her days circling the same loss, carrying around heartbreak like it was part of her uniform. There were centuries of it built up by now, packed into every wordless nook, every unfinished thought, every time she let Agatha’s name sit in the back of her throat like it hurt too much to say. Sage watched her wander through the same pain over and over, like there was still something noble about staying broken. Like if Rio kept bleeding long enough, maybe her wife would come back - just to shut up whatever was still wailing for Agatha Harkness. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And for what? </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> For a woman who’d found the most dramatic way out imaginable, only to cheat the ending. Agatha couldn’t outrun Death, so she created a loophole. Died on purpose, then hung around anyway, floating just out of reach, haunting the surface. Spending her time with Billy fucking Maximoff, of all people, following him around like some ghostly shadow, as if the whole thing wasn’t batshit insane. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And maybe Sage had never really known Agatha. Not the way she wanted to. Not the way she should have. But that didn’t change the fact that she loved her anyway. How could she not? She was her mother. That was supposed to mean something. And still, Agatha had left her with nothing but stories and silence, then had the nerve to spend whatever was left of herself playing the sidekick of another woman’s son. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And Rio just let it happen.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She sat in the middle of her own suffering and called it peace. Pretended it was enough to mourn someone who hadn't actually left. Kept the grief alive like it was the only part of Agatha she still knew how to hold. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And honestly? Sage was tired of it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha wasn’t coming back to quiet the wailing. She wasn’t the one trying to stop the bleeding. That was Sage. She was the one kneeling over the mess, hands pressed to the wound, trying to stitch her mother back together before she lost her for good. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No one else was willing to put their hands on it. No one else had the stomach to press down and keep the bleeding from getting worse, to hold the wound together long enough for something to heal. Someone had to keep her mother from tearing in half, and it sure as hell wasn’t going to be the one who sliced her open. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The sky had been holding the weight of it for weeks. Heavy. Unmoving. Like it was just as fed up as she was, waiting for someone to finally do something about the mess none of them seemed brave enough to touch. And every time Sage looked up, it was staring right back, daring her to stop pretending this was anyone else’s job. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She wiped her hands on her pants and looked up to the sky that had turned her every private feeling into a forecast, like it was still owed an explanation for all the trouble she made it carry. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Don’t worry,” Sage muttered. “I’ll clean it up.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>A year wasn’t much. Not against the centuries they’d already lost to anger and grief. Just a handful of seasons passing, one folding into the next before any of them thought to hold on tighter. But it was enough to get a taste. Enough to feel what it was like to stay, to want, to wonder what might come next.</p><p> </p><p>And that was the danger of it- how easily it made you greedy. One spring turned into summer. One summer into fall. And before long, Agatha found herself craving more. More mornings. More arguments that didn’t end in someone leaving. More afternoons spent remembering how to live without waking up bracing for the worst. Without clawing for more power, more chaos just to keep herself upright. For once, she wasn’t trying to outrun the end.</p><p> </p><p>A year wasn’t much. But it was enough to make Agatha want the next one. And the one after that. And every single one they could steal while they still had the chance.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Winter:</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had always hated winter.</p><p> </p><p>Hated the silence of it. Hated the way everything slowed down and shrank back and died off like that was just the natural order of things. Like surrendering was noble. Like decay was something to be endured politely.</p><p> </p><p>It made everything harder. The cold. The dark. The endless waiting for something better to come along that never did. Back then, winter wasn’t peaceful. It was just another thing to carry. One more season to survive. Another excuse to remind her how much lighter the world felt when you had less to lose.</p><p> </p><p>The invention of central heating and air had been the only real improvement. A modern mercy. But even that wasn’t enough to make Agatha like the season.</p><p> </p><p>The only thing enjoyable about winter was the part where everything green finally gave up. The plants, the vines, the creeping, stubborn things that always fought too hard to hold on.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that wasn’t just about the plants.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>If winter weren’t already miserable on its own, there was Christmas. Agatha loathed Christmas. The noise, the clutter, the forced cheerfulness of it all. An entire holiday built around pretending the darkest part of the year was worth celebrating. It was exhausting.</p><p> </p><p>And, of course, Sage loved it.</p><p> </p><p>“You hate Christmas?” Sage asked incredulously.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shrugged, tugging the blanket tighter around her shoulders. “It’s colder than a witch’s tit in a brass bra. Don’t you control the weather? Make it warm.”</p><p> </p><p>“Brass bra, you say?” Rio piped up from the armchair, wiggling her eyebrows like it was the highlight of her day.</p><p> </p><p>Sage whipped around, stared at Rio, and slowly lifted a finger. “That’s fucking disgusting,” she said, drawing out each word.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a valid visual.”</p><p> </p><p>She turned right back to Agatha like Rio didn’t exist. “And that’s not how it works,” waving Agatha’s request off without a second thought. “How can you hate Christmas?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, wrapped the blanket tighter around herself, and gave Sage a look like she’d just asked why water was wet. “Because it’s awful,” she said flatly. The answer felt so obvious she couldn’t imagine why they were still talking.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not an answer.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s the only one you’re getting.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage squinted at her, looking her up and down like she was assessing the situation, or worse, calculating. Then she leaned back into the couch, arms crossed over her chest, and said, “Okay,” with the kind of confidence that made Agatha immediately regret every choice that led to this conversation.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Oh no. No, no, no, no, no. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have to ask what came next. She already knew. Nothing good ever came out of Sage’s scheming. The girl had a long, painful history of turning mild inconveniences into full scale productions, and Agatha had no doubt she was about to become an unwilling participant of whatever terrible idea had just taken shape.</p><p> </p><p><em> Well. </em> That wasn’t entirely true. There had been one exception. Sage’s scheming had, on one occasion, managed to accomplish something worthwhile, and Agatha supposed being dragged to this realm was technically a point in her favor. But even that was debatable on certain days, and today was quickly becoming one of them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled the blanket tighter around her shoulders, tucking it under her chin hoping the extra layer might somehow shield her from whatever holiday nightmare Sage was quietly constructing.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was trapped in the kind of nightmare that left emotional scars. Somewhere, in the middle of a blizzard that smelled suspiciously like peppermint, she was being chased through an endless maze of tinsel by a choir of carolers wearing matching reindeer sweaters. No matter how fast she walked, they followed- smiling. Waving. Harmonizing. And from above, blaring through invisible speakers mounted in the sky itself, was the worst song mankind had ever produced.</p><p> </p><p>“Last Christmas” by Wham!</p><p> </p><p>On repeat.</p><p> </p><p>Indefinitely.</p><p> </p><p>By the third loop, she was sprinting. By the fifth, she was begging for death. By the seventh, Rio appeared out of nowhere, tossing fake snow into the air and mouthing the lyrics directly at her like this was some kind of flash mob.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha startled awake with a gasp, heart racing, blanket tangled around her ankles. For a few brief, glorious seconds, she thought it was over.</p><p> </p><p>But it wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>The song was still playing.</p><p> </p><p>Faint at first, but definitely real. Definitely happening. And growing louder by the second, until there was no denying it was blasting from the living room like Sage had hired a DJ and decided to throw a holiday rave.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped her head to the left, ready to bark at Rio to go shut it off, but the bed was empty.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha threw the blanket off, stomped to the door, and yanked it open- only to find Rio standing right there, frozen mid step in the hallway.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t even pretending to notice the music rattling the walls. No, Rio was simply standing there, entirely deadpan, dragging a full sized Christmas tree behind her like it was the most reasonable thing in the world.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked once. Then twice.</p><p> </p><p>She actually considered slamming the door closed and going back to sleep, in the hope that reality would sort itself out without her involvement.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she pointed at the tree. “What. Is that.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio glanced back over her shoulder, utterly unbothered. “Sage made me do it.”</p><p> </p><p>And as “Last Christmas” hit its chorus for what had to be the twelfth time, Agatha came to the deeply unsettling conclusion that she might still be dreaming.</p><p> </p><p>Except this time, she wasn’t sure she'd ever wake up.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>“No! It’s crooked!” Sage yelled, pointing toward the roof like Rio had committed an unforgivable crime.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood beside her, freezing, regretting that she had come outside at all. Sage hadn’t stopped shouting directions since Rio climbed up there, and Agatha was starting to lose feeling in her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted the section of lights without complaint. This was the sixth adjustment Sage had demanded, and somehow Rio still looked perfectly calm. If anything, she looked focused, like Sage’s opinion was the only one that mattered.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus Christ,” Agatha mumbled.</p><p> </p><p>Sage glanced over at her, grinning. “That’s the spirit.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled the blanket tighter around her shoulders. “I hope the roof collapses.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage pointed back up without missing a beat. “Tell her the left side still looks weird.”</p><p> </p><p>Begrudgingly, Agatha did.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had barely stepped into the bedroom when Rio shot up from the end of the bed, holding a hand out like she was stopping traffic.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha startled, “What? What? What’s on me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio only pointed above her head, wearing that smug grin that always makes Agatha immediately suspicious.</p><p> </p><p>She frowned, glancing up. And there it was. Hanging in all its ridiculous glory. </p><p> </p><p>A mistletoe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated Christmas. She hated the decorations. She hated the nonstop music Sage refused to turn down.  But she didn’t hate Rio when she got like this. All pleased with herself, looking like she’d just pulled off the world’s greatest romantic ambush. Maybe, against her better judgment, the smallest smile found its way to Agatha’s lips.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a parasite, you know,” Agatha said, still staring up at it. “You’d think that would go against your whole thing. Don’t you speak for the trees?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was already sliding off the bed, grin growing wider as she made her way over. “God, that’s sexy. Tell me more plant facts.” Her arm slipped around Agatha’s waist like it belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>When she pulled back, she gave Rio a narrow look. “You love it just as much as she does, don’t you?”</p><p> </p><p>Not once during this entire miserable holiday had Rio looked half as irritated as Agatha felt. She hadn’t complained once. She hadn’t rolled her eyes or muttered under her breath. If anything, she seemed like she was barely holding back from joining Sage in making it worse.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, “I love it because she does. And watching someone else suffer through it with me is kind of nice.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, but it didn’t stop her from kissing Rio again.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Today was the dreaded day. Sage’s second favorite holiday, right behind the ever glorious Groundhog Day. Almost as ridiculous as Rio’s favorite, which, somehow, was Arbor Day… Arbor Day. Agatha was married to the fucking Lorax, she was convinced.</p><p> </p><p>But that was beside the point.</p><p> </p><p>What really mattered was the discovery she’d made about Sage’s obsession with Groundhog Day. It wasn’t about the groundhog itself- no, that would have been almost tolerable. Sage loved it specifically because it was, as she put it, <em> ’the dumbest, most pointless thing the United States had ever collectively agreed to take seriously, and no one questions it.’ </em></p><p> </p><p>And she didn’t just make fun of it in passing. According to Rio, Sage treated it like an annual event. She had charts. She had commentary. She set alarms. She followed the groundhog's career like it was a competitive sport.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “It’s hilarious, actually,” Rio said, laughing. “She makes me sit with her every year to watch the results like it’s an election. Then spends the whole day making passive aggressive remarks about how we’ve built an entire system of seasonal weather predictions on the instincts of a large rodent and humanity has clearly reached its peak.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, upon learning all this, had immediately made a mental note to ruin Sage’s life by believing in the groundhog completely. Fully, unironically, deeply invested.</p><p> </p><p>Six more weeks of winter? Say no more. She would nod gravely and take to the couch like a grieving widow. Early spring? She’d congratulate the groundhog on his hard work and faithfulness to his craft.</p><p> </p><p>And she wouldn’t break. Not once.</p><p> </p><p>But that was for February.</p><p> </p><p>For now, it was Christmas fucking day.</p><p> </p><p>And that was worse.</p><p> </p><p>The house was already decked out in its ridiculous holiday best. Every surface was covered in garland. Candles flickered in the windows. The stockings were stuffed and crooked, which Rio kept adjusting like the world would end if they weren’t perfectly lined up. The tree had been finished for days, an over decorated monstrosity in the corner, twinkling like it had something to prove.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Agatha made it to the kitchen, Sage was already narrating the day like some over caffeinated cruise director. There was an itinerary. Breakfast first. Gifts after. Then a movie Sage claimed was a mandatory viewing, insisting that Home Alone was “a profound meditation on self reliance.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio, the traitor that she was, had the nerve to nod along like this made any sense.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed wrapped in her blanket, parked in the corner of the couch, and sighed through most of it. She made snide remarks about Sage’s breakfast spread, complained that the hot chocolate was too sweet, rolled her eyes every time someone used the phrase “holiday spirit.” But no one paid her any mind.</p><p> </p><p>And somehow, that was fine.</p><p> </p><p>Because even with the awful music and Sage insisting they all wear matching pajamas for “the aesthetic,” Agatha couldn’t bring herself to leave. Maybe it was Rio, pressed up against her side, stealing sips from her cup. Maybe it was Sage, sitting forward on the couch, reciting half the movie’s lines from memory while making deeply serious observations about home security. Maybe it was the way neither of them seemed to care that Agatha had grumbled through the whole morning.</p><p> </p><p>They just let her complain.</p><p> </p><p>And she did. But she also stayed exactly where she was, warm under her blanket, watching the two of them laugh over some ridiculous scene they’d already seen a hundred times.</p><p> </p><p>Later, when Sage finally passed out on the floor, surrounded by torn wrapping paper and half a dozen empty mugs, Agatha leaned over to Rio and whispered, “Your daughter is out of control.”</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t move. Not even when Rio laughed, and not even when Sage, half asleep, muttered that she loved them both.</p><p> </p><p>She stayed right where she was, pulled the blanket higher, and decided it was only mildly concerning how she would absolutely sit through another one of these holidays.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>It was January, and the house was quiet. The only sounds were the ticking of the clock and the soft clink of chess pieces against the wooden board. Agatha was focused, eyes narrowed as she considered her next move, while Sage sat across from her, slouched in her chair, idly spinning a captured pawn between her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Sage had been rambling for a while now. Agatha had tuned most of it out, letting the words fade into background noise while she debated the best way to trap Sage’s king. It wasn’t until she slid her rook forward that she caught the tail end of what Sage had just said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s fingers stilled against the rook. Her head lifted, eyes narrowing as the words she had almost ignored registered.</p><p> </p><p>"Wait- " She blinked. "Slow down. You hacked S.W.O.R.D.?"</p><p> </p><p>Sage met her gaze, unimpressed. "Uhh, yeah?" Her eyes flickered to the side and back, like she couldn't believe Agatha thought this was worth questioning, as if hacking a government agency was just a normal Tuesday activity.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair and exhaled slowly, pinching the bridge of her nose, already regretting her own question. "And why, pray tell, would you do that?"</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Sage shrugged, tossing one of her knights into the air. “Got bored one day. Saw they were investigating some ‘Westview Anomaly’ and poked around. Turns out they picked up a broadcast signal and started recording it.” She caught the knight with ease, then swung it down, knocking Agatha’s rook off the board like it was an afterthought. “You were funny.” She planted the piece in its place with a decisive thunk.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha wasn’t looking at the game anymore. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Sage kept fucking talking.</p><p> </p><p>“Hooked it up to the TV. We watched every single episode.” Her daughter paused, then corrected herself. “Well, I did. She couldn’t see you, you know, because of the whole Darkhold situation.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s hand lifted as she leaned forward, shielding the side of her mouth as if conspiring against someone unseen. With her other hand, she pointed toward the study, where Rio was no doubt deep in another internet rabbit hole, obsessively researching whatever absurd question had hijacked her thoughts that day.</p><p> </p><p>Lowering her voice to a whisper, Sage added, “But don’t worry, I never told her you were flirting with Wanda.” She dropped her hands and leaned back, expression blank for a beat before she raised a brow. “Which, by the way, was fucked up. Not that I was exactly subtle. I’m pretty sure she figured it out just by the shade of green I turned every time you did.” To drive the point home, she jabbed a finger in front of her open mouth and made a mock gag, the mere thought of it was enough to make her sick.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was saying too many words, doing too many ridiculous -if admittedly funny- things. Agatha couldn't process it all. The only thing that cut through the noise was the sudden flare of anger she felt. Her fingers pressed against the edge of the kitchen chair she currently occupied, grip tightening as she forced her voice to stay even.</p><p> </p><p>"You both knew I was in Westview?" The words left her through clenched teeth, her patience hanging by a thread.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” Sage frowned, her brows pulling together. “You didn’t know?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands gripped the table as she leaned forward, “No, I didn’t fucking know.” The words came out fast, mocking her daughter’s innocent question. Her gaze flicked toward the study where her wife was, then snapped right back to the pain in her ass.</p><p> </p><p>Sage stared at Agatha, mouth slightly open, eyes wide with something that looked suspiciously like excitement at seeing her mother get worked up. “Okay, you can’t seriously be mad about this,” she said, amusement and sincerity mixing in her voice. “You were hidden by the Darkhold. She couldn’t do anything about that, and I was stuck here. It’s not like she just left you to fend for yourself.”</p><p> </p><p>"WHAT- " Agatha caught herself. She needed to calm down. Her hand pressed against her chest as she took a quick, determined breath, then she slapped it down on the table. "What the fuck does that mean?"</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t any less aggressive, but it was quieter, and for now, Agatha considered that a win.</p><p> </p><p>“Herb and Sharon- ”</p><p> </p><p>“Who the fuck is Sharon?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage looked at Agatha like she had just said something profoundly stupid. "Mrs. Hart..." Sage let the name hang, lifting a brow. Her gaze lingered on Agatha, expectant, waiting for the realization to finally click.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at Sage, the name meaning nothing to her at first… then it clicked.<em>   </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> Ahhh.. Mrs. Hart. Right. Right. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She pressed a hand to her chest, inhaling a long, theatrical breath. "Of course, yes..." She made the sign of the cross, "R.I.P. Mrs. Hart." A belated show of respect for the woman she had only just remembered existed.</p><p> </p><p>Sage stared at her, a mix of mild horror and confusion settling on her face. Her eyes flicked to the side, then back to Agatha, trying to decide whether to question it or just let it go.</p><p> </p><p>"Um… okay," her daughter said slowly, clearly deciding to move past whatever <em> that </em> was. "Mom brought you groceries every day."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s blood went cold.</p><p> </p><p>"She had the neighbors deliver them. Made sure Herb or Sharon" -and there was no missing the pointed emphasis on the name- "got them to you."</p><p> </p><p>Every day.</p><p> </p><p>The spell had trapped her in that house, her body moving, her mind slipping between realities she had no control over. One day she was a detective solving a case. Most days she was just Agnes, the nosy neighbor with a coffee cup in hand and nothing better to do than post about suspicious activity on neighborhood watch forums. Some days she was nothing at all.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio had been there.</p><p> </p><p>Every day.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tried to speak, tried to say something, anything, but her voice didn’t come.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t move.</p><p> </p><p>Didn’t blink.</p><p> </p><p>Didn’t breathe.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Sage had left her to deal with it on her own. That was fine. Agatha preferred it that way.</p><p> </p><p>She sat on the couch, staring at nothing, not thinking, not moving, just there. The house was quiet. Then the cushion beside her dipped. She didn’t look right away, just flicked her eyes to the side.</p><p> </p><p>Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Her gaze slid back to the empty space in front of her, so she could pretend for a little longer that she was still alone.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey?” Rio’s voice was careful, uncertain. “You okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the question sit. Then, finally, she turned to look at her wife. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s frown deepened, “Tell you what?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t need to ask to know Rio had no idea what she was talking about. That almost made it worse.</p><p> </p><p>“Westview.” The word came out quiet, sharp. “The whole time. You knew.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. “Agatha…” There was hesitation in her voice, like she was already bracing for whatever was coming next.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just stared at her. She wasn’t in the mood for Rio’s approach, for the way she always seemed to think about her words before speaking, like Agatha was too fragile to hear the truth.</p><p> </p><p>“You knew,” she repeated, firmer this time. “And you didn’t think to tell me?”</p><p> </p><p> “What would it have changed?”</p><p> </p><p>Nothing. Everything. Agatha didn’t know.</p><p> </p><p>All she knew was that Rio had brought her groceries every day for three years. After everything. After Agatha had spent centuries making her life hell, after she had driven the knife in over and over just to see how deep it would go, Rio had still shown up. Even when she couldn’t see her. Even when she had known there was no way of knowing Agatha would ever know, or care, or acknowledge it.</p><p> </p><p>She still made sure Agatha was taken care of.</p><p> </p><p>Her throat felt tight, but she pushed past it, forcing herself to meet Rio’s eyes. “Why?” The word barely made it past her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Then, with the kind of simplicity that made Agatha want to tear her hair out, Rio said, “Would you have preferred if I left you to starve?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha clenched her jaw. “I would have preferred if you hated me like a normal person.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, shaking her head. “Yeah, well, I never quite figured out how to not be in love with you. So that wasn’t gonna happen.”</p><p> </p><p>And that was the problem, wasn’t it? Agatha had known that. She had always known.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had never been capable of cruelty, not in the way Agatha had. She had never been the kind of person to cut clean and walk away. Stubborn. Steady. Infuriatingly good, even when she had no reason to be.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, looking away, “You’re an idiot.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio just hummed in agreement, “Definitely.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha used to hate winter.</p><p> </p><p>Hated the silence of it. Hated the way it crept in, slow and suffocating, like the whole world was holding its breath, waiting for an ending it had no choice but to accept. Hated the way everything shrank back and withered, how even the most stubborn things eventually gave in.</p><p> </p><p>She used to see it as proof that nothing lasted. That no matter how hard something fought to hold on, sooner or later, it would lose.</p><p> </p><p>But now, winter didn’t feel like surrender.</p><p> </p><p>The quiet no longer felt empty. The cold didn’t press in quite the same way. And when everything green finally gave up, it didn’t feel like loss.</p><p> </p><p>Because come spring, it would return. It always did. No matter how many times it withered. No matter how many times the cold tried to take it.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it had never been about giving up. Maybe it had always been about coming back.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that wasn’t just about the plants.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Spring:</p><p> </p><p>Agatha always hated spring.</p><p> </p><p>Everything turned green too fast. The grass. The trees. The hills that had been comfortably dull and lifeless for months were suddenly alive again, like they thought anyone had missed them. It was all so eager. So desperate to remind the world it was still here. Agatha hadn’t asked for the color back. She hadn’t missed it.</p><p> </p><p>Winter knew how to mind its own business. It kept things quiet. Still. Dead. Spring never could manage that. It came back loud and bright, creeping over every bare corner until there wasn’t a patch of earth left untouched. Green climbing over stone. Green filling the air. Green in places Agatha swore nothing had been growing the day before.</p><p> </p><p>She kept waiting for it to exhaust itself. For the season to burn out early and leave the fields empty again. But year after year, it never did.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was sitting on the couch, reading a book about botany of all things. Why? Reasonable question. Maybe she liked the way her wife looked at her whenever she rattled off some fact she’d stolen from it. Like it was charming. Like it was impressive. Like Agatha had gone out of her way to care about the same things Rio did, which- fine. Maybe she had.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was stretched out beside her, legs dangling over the arm of the couch, the top of her head pressed against the side of Agatha’s thigh. She’d been unusually quiet for a while now, lost in whatever thought had managed to keep her occupied this long.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t mind.</p><p> </p><p>The quiet was rare. Sage usually filled every second of it just to hear herself talk, and Agatha had gotten used to letting her. But right now, with the sun spilling through the windows and the whole realm trying a little too hard to smell like new grass, Agatha turned another page and decided she didn’t hate this.</p><p> </p><p>Not at all.</p><p> </p><p>“If things were different, and you hadn’t been a witch. Just some normal person. What do you think you’d do for a living?”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Well. There goes that thought. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother looking up from her book. “I wouldn’t,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t have to see Sage to know the exact face she was making. Could practically hear the way her brow scrunched up right before the innocent little, “What?” that would’ve pissed Agatha off if it came from anyone else.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, snapped the book shut, and set it on the arm of the couch. She looked down at Sage, sprawled across the cushions, waiting like this was a question worth answering.</p><p> </p><p>“Work,” Agatha said. “I wouldn’t work. Why would I willingly participate in the labor force? Ideally, I’d be a housewife. No cooking. No cleaning. Just the wife.”</p><p> </p><p>She knew how that sounded. Knew it by the way Sage’s face lit up like she was about to launch into some long winded speech about how gay that was.</p><p> </p><p>But Sage let it go, shockingly.</p><p> </p><p>“What would Mom be?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head back against the couch. “I don’t know. Probably selling overpriced fruit and wildflowers at some farmers market. You know how she is.”</p><p> </p><p>“A housewife and a farmers market vendor? In this economy?” Sage snorted. “You’d be homeless. Which means no land for her precious fruit.”</p><p> </p><p>“We’d live here,” Agatha said.</p><p> </p><p>“Here doesn’t exist. Come on, give it to me straight. What’s something you think you could actually stand doing?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down at her.</p><p> </p><p>“You want straight answers,” she said with a shrug, “ask a straight lady.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage groaned. “God. Get a new line” She said, dragging a hand down her face. </p><p> </p><p>“Cant,” Agatha smirked. “It’s a fan favorite.”</p><p> </p><p>“Debatable,” Sage sighed, kicking lightly at the couch.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>At some point, Sage fucked off upstairs, and Agatha picked her book back up.</p><p> </p><p>She’d been reading about plants that only bloom after fire, the ones that refused to open unless everything around them had already been burned to the ground. Entire forests reduced to ash, and only then did they decide it was safe to start living.</p><p> </p><p>It felt dramatic, sure, but Agatha couldn’t exactly blame them. She understood the appeal.</p><p> </p><p>She heard Rio’s footsteps coming from their bedroom and didn’t think anything of it. They were slow, easy, like they usually were when her wife wasn’t in any hurry to be anywhere.  Agatha didn’t bother looking up at first, assuming she was just passing through on her way to do something equally unimportant. </p><p> </p><p>Except the footsteps stopped at the threshold of the living room, lingering just long enough to make it clear this wasn’t just passing through. Agatha kept her eyes on the page for another second, stubborn out of principle, but the pause stretched, and eventually Rio cleared her throat, soft and pointed like she was waiting to be acknowledged.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finally looked up, already prepared to be irritated. And immediately she forgot how to be annoyed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was standing there like it was nothing, wearing a soft pink dress with delicate little bows tied at the shoulders. Her hair was pinned back just enough to look like she hadn’t put in any effort, though Agatha knew better, because no one accidentally ended up looking like that. And the dress itself, light and thin in a way that left exactly nothing to the imagination, clung just right. Agatha couldn’t stop herself from noticing the way the fabric did absolutely no work hiding her wife’s nipples.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t think. She didn’t speak. She just moved.</p><p> </p><p>The book slid off her lap and hit the floor with a dull thud as she shot up too fast, managing to slam her knee directly into the coffee table hard enough to send whatever Sage had left on top of it rattling to the floor.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“God- fuck,” Agatha snapped, gripping the edge of the couch with one hand and her knee with the other, trying to keep her balance while pretending she wasn’t actively falling apart.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, entirely unaffected, stayed exactly where she was, watching from the threshold as though she hadn’t just been the direct cause of nearly shattering Agatha’s kneecap. “You good?” Rio asked, her voice calm.</p><p> </p><p>“No. Not even remotely,” Agatha mumbled, rubbing at her knee and glaring at her wife like that might fix it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood up straighter and moved toward Rio, or at least she tried to. She limped through the first few steps, her body trying to remind her of the damage, but she forced herself forward anyway. Staying put wasn’t an option. Not when Rio looked that fucking good. It felt wrong to be sitting across the room like an observer when all she wanted was to be close enough to do something about it.</p><p> </p><p>It was pathetic, really, how easily Rio managed to pull the ground out from under her, and worse that Agatha didn’t bother trying to stop her.</p><p> </p><p>She stopped right in front of Rio. Her knee still ached, her pulse felt ridiculous, and Rio was just standing there, looking like that, wearing a soft, shy smile like she wasn’t actively ruining Agatha’s life.</p><p> </p><p>Her brain gave up entirely. Any decent thought she might’ve had dissolved the second Rio tilted her head, waiting, giving her that quiet look that told Agatha she had all the time in the world.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could think better of it, Agatha flicked her hair over her shoulder, cleared her throat like a fool, and said, “So... you uh, come here often?” She added a shrug for good measure, trying somehow to make it sound smoother, and pressed her lips together in what she hoped looked casual, though it felt about as natural as walking into traffic.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the heat crawl up the back of her neck almost instantly, and she thought briefly about walking straight out of the room and pretending none of this had ever happened. Maybe pretending she had never existed at all. But Rio didn’t laugh. She didn’t even comment. She just kept looking at her with that same soft smile, but now the gap in her teeth was showing like some kind of reward, like Agatha had done something impressive instead of humiliating herself.</p><p> </p><p>“God,” Agatha mumbled, dragging her hand over her face, not bothering to hide how pathetic this had become. “Ignore me. I’m concussed or something.”</p><p> </p><p>“I liked it,” Rio said quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother responding. She didn’t have the energy for it, not after fumbling that hard. It felt like her brain had shorted out somewhere between standing up and completely humiliating herself, and Rio was just standing there like she hadn’t noticed a thing. She didn’t look even a little bit amused, or smug, or like she’d noticed anything embarrassing at all. She just kept watching her, eyes soft in a way that made Agatha’s stomach twist, like she was the only thing in the room worth paying attention to.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached out and slid her fingers around Agatha’s hand, her grip gentle as she pulled her in without saying a word, and Agatha, already past the point of pretending to resist, let herself go without thinking twice. Her hands found Rio’s hips, and she let Agatha get as close as she wanted, crossing her arms loosely between them, like this was supposed to happen and neither of them needed to make a big deal out of it.</p><p> </p><p>“You look really pretty,” Agatha whispered, because it was the only thing left in her head worth saying, and keeping it there felt impossible.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand settled at the back of Agatha’s neck, her thumb tracing slow circles that made it very difficult for Agatha to hold on to a single coherent thought.</p><p> </p><p>“Wanna go on a date?” Rio asked, her voice sickeningly sweet, as if she wasn’t already standing there looking ridiculous in the best possible way.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her smile before she could stop it, small and crooked and entirely unhelpful.</p><p> </p><p>“So that’s what all this is for,” Agatha said quietly, her hands squeezing Rio’s waist, giving her a look that was meant to be unimpressed but probably landed somewhere closer to completely gone. “Thought you were just wandering around the house trying to kill me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, though her grin only widened. “Little of both,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath, her thumb brushing idly along the fabric at Rio’s side.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” she whispered. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The bench was a nice place to sit after the walk up, not that Agatha had really been paying attention to the climb. Her focus had been on far more pressing matters- like the absolute masterpiece that was her unfairly attractive wife.</p><p> </p><p>On the way up, Agatha followed behind Rio, watching her, unable to help herself. Every bit of exposed skin, the way she moved, the sway of her hips. She was shameless about it. Every so often, Rio would glance back at her and smile, sweet and knowing, just enough for Agatha to catch a glimpse of the gap in her teeth. She was fucking obsessed with it. The whole thing felt like a scene ripped straight out of one of those awful romantic movies she’d be forced to sit through, one she’d actively gag during just to make a point. And yet, every time Rio looked at her, her heart swelled so much it felt like it was crawling up her throat. Like she might vomit it right there onto the path.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sat first, stretching her legs out in front of her as she let out a slow breath. When Rio sat down beside her, there was more space between them than Agatha appreciated. Without a second thought, she scooted closer until their bodies were almost pressed together. She didn’t miss the way Rio bit her bottom lip, a poor attempt at keeping her smile in check.</p><p> </p><p>Now, sitting at the top of the hill in a part of the realm she had never been to before, Agatha let her gaze drift out over the field. Wildflowers covered everything in sight, a soft, endless blur of color rolling through the valley. The whole place felt still, the wind moving easy over the hill, carrying the scent of the flowers up to where they sat.</p><p> </p><p>"How far out does this place go?" Agatha asked, breathless. The sheer vastness of this realm stole the air from her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>"Forever," Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned to her, expecting a tease, a smirk, something playful. But Rio wasn’t looking at her. She was staring out at the valley, eyes distant, completely and utterly lost to the beauty of it.</p><p> </p><p>"And how much of it have you seen?" Agatha asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>“Every inch.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew she meant it. There was no guesswork, no exaggeration. Rio had seen it all. Walked through it, watched it shift, watched it exist. There wasn’t a single part of this realm that hadn’t, at some point, been under her gaze.</p><p> </p><p>As beautiful as it was, as endless and breathtaking as it stretched before her, the thought of it made Agatha feel something close to sorrow. Not for herself. For Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had always been running toward something or away from it, always locked in a battle, always reaching for the next fight. It had shaped her, sharpened her. Even now, settled, she could still feel the habit of it pressing against her, as light as a tap against her ribs, never quite leaving. But the rage, the kind that once consumed her, had quieted. What little of it remained had long since found a single, unmoving target.</p><p> </p><p><em> Eternity </em> <b>.</b></p><p> </p><p>The name sat heavy in her mind, an impossible thing, vast and untouchable, and yet it was the one enemy Agatha could not let go of. Not because it had ever wronged her, not because it had ever stood in her way, but because it had taken Rio and refused to let her go.</p><p> </p><p>This realm stretched on forever because it had to. Because Rio was bound to it, tied to a never ending existence that wasn’t a gift, but a sentence. Agatha knew the burden of it, even if Rio would never say it out loud. She had carried it for lifetimes, had made peace with it in a way Agatha never could.</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha had spent her whole life fighting an ending. And Rio had never even been allowed one.</p><p> </p><p>Her ribs ached with the thought. It would be easy to let it fester, easy to let that old, familiar fire flare up into something consuming. But she had spent too many years drowning in rage, letting it guide her hand. This was different. This was clear.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had fought 'gods' and won. She had outlived monsters, toppled entire covens, torn through anything that had ever tried to stand in her way. And now, the last thing between them and the ending they deserved wasn’t a witch, wasn’t a beast, wasn’t a god. It was something bigger, something no one had ever dared to challenge.</p><p> </p><p>And there was absolutely nothing Agatha could do about it. There was no spell, no trick, no enemy to defeat to change Rio’s mind. It wasn’t something she could burn down or tear apart. It just was. <em> Eternity was. </em> And that was what made it so fucking insufferable.</p><p> </p><p>"Do you ever think about it?" The words slipped out before Agatha could stop them, too quick to take back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed in question, tilting her head slightly in Agatha’s direction, though her gaze remained fixed on the field below.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed, choosing her next words with more care. "What it would be like to give It up?" She needed Rio to understand what she meant. Needed even more for it not to piss her off.</p><p> </p><p>She had never asked for details. Never wanted to know. What good would it do? It wasn’t knowledge she needed. She didn’t need the idea of her, Rio, and Nicky in whatever came next, in whatever afterlife existed beyond this place. Sage had ties to it, slipping into it in her sleep like it was nothing. Half life, half death. Maybe she could be there too. But that part -Sage- was the question mark, the uncertain answer to an already impossible equation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had learned as much the day she snuck into Rio’s office while Sage was meant to be helping in the garden, though Agatha had heard her instead, trailing after her mother, talking her ear off. Rio hadn’t minded. So Agatha had gone inside, pulled Sage’s journal from a stack of notes, and read it cover to end three times over. Sage had mapped it all out- the transfer of power, the shift of the realm, the space she could carve out for herself beyond this place. On paper, it worked. But Sage was the flaw in her own design.</p><p> </p><p>Because what if it didn’t work? What if none of it worked? There were too many unknowns, too many ways it could go wrong. And even if it did work, if Sage ended up bound to the same endless existence that had trapped Rio- forced to carry Death, to witness its worst, to exist outside of time- then what the hell was the point of hoping for any of it?</p><p> </p><p>That was the thought Agatha held onto when hope pressed too hard against her skull, when it lingered too long, when it threatened to turn into something too big, too dangerous, too impossible to let go.</p><p> </p><p>But right now, with love seared into her bones, wrapped around her heart, piercing through and weaving itself deep within her, she wondered if resisting had ever been an option. If there had ever been a version of herself that could love Rio and not want more.</p><p> </p><p>Rio still wasn’t looking at her, but at the question, her eyes flicked away from the field, just for a moment. The sun caught in them, turning their brown a shade closer to gold, making her squint. Agatha caught the way she bit the inside of her lip, just barely. A small, almost imperceptible shake of her head.</p><p> </p><p>"No," Rio said, simply.</p><p> </p><p>She was lying.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had seen Rio lie before- effortless, smooth, sometimes even charming. This wasn’t that. This was the type of lie Rio told when she didn’t care if it was believed, when the answer wasn’t for Agatha but for herself. No smirk, no deflection, just a single word, blunt and hollow, like saying it plain would be enough to make it true.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha hated that she wouldn’t admit it. Hated that Rio had carried this for so long that pretending it wasn’t there had become instinct. Hated that even now, even with Agatha beside her, she still thought this was something she had to hold alone.</p><p> </p><p>That was the worst part.</p><p> </p><p>Not the lie itself, but the fact that Rio thought she had to tell it.</p><p> </p><p>Because Agatha knew. She knew what it was like to sit with the thought, to let it creep in when no one was watching. To wonder- not just about what came next, but about what it would mean if Rio gave it up. What it would mean if she stopped being Death<b>.</b> If she let go, if she chose to step down, if she walked away from all of it.</p><p> </p><p>They weren’t supposed to think like that. Not after everything. Not when the world still turned because Rio bore the weight of it. It felt selfish to even imagine. Like asking for too much when they had already taken more than their share.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, Agatha had wondered.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe, so had Rio.</p><p> </p><p>And for a moment, Rio didn’t move past it.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe that’s what made the lie so overpowering. Not that Rio denied it, but that they both knew it wasn’t true. That they had both sat in the dark, separately, quietly, wondering the same thing. And neither of them could say it out loud.</p><p> </p><p>"You always were a shit liar," Agatha murmured. It wasn’t an accusation, just an acknowledgment.</p><p> </p><p>“You think Sage could beat a bear in a fight?”</p><p> </p><p>A door slammed shut. A candle snuffed out. Rio’s mask slid back into place so seamlessly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. “…What?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate, “A bear. If she had to. You think she’d win?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, trying to decide if this was some kind of tactic or if Rio had actually lost her mind. “Is she allowed magic?”</p><p> </p><p>“No magic. Just hands.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, shaking her head. “She’d die.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed like she was actually considering it. “I don’t know. She fights dirty.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply, not quite a laugh, not quite a sigh. “Why the fuck are we talking about this?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, her posture relaxed. “Just wondering.”</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, the conversation was gone. Wiped clean. Like it had never been spoken at all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, shifting so she was facing Rio fully now. "You know," she started, tone thoughtful, "for someone who pretends to be so wise and all knowing, you sure do say a lot of stupid shit."</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, real and loud, it shook through her, unrestrained and full. The sound carried easily through the air, warm and familiar, settling between them like it had always belonged.</p><p> </p><p>They sat there for a while, talking about nothing and everything. Conversation that stretched without effort, weaving between stories half forgotten and moments neither of them had thought about in years. Agatha let herself relax into it, let herself enjoy the way Rio’s voice moved between dry amusement and quiet affection, the way she shifted closer without thinking, the way her fingers brushed against Agatha’s skin absentmindedly as she spoke. The field stretched out before them, the wind moved lazily over the hill, and for a little while, there was nothing to fight, nothing to chase, just this. Just Rio, just her warmth, just the ease of being beside her.</p><p> </p><p>In the quiet, Agatha found herself staring. She let her gaze drift over Rio’s face, the slope of her neck, the exposed skin of her shoulders, lower, where the fabric of her dress rested against her. Her eyes caught on the ring on Rio’s finger, the way she spun it absently in her lap. She wasn’t looking at Agatha, her attention fixed on the field of wildflowers stretching out before them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked breathtaking. She always did, but there was something about her now, sitting in the sunlight, her hair pulled up to bare the curve of her throat, the delicate lines of her collarbones. Her skin was warm under the golden light, the soft fabric of her dress draped over her thighs, leaving just enough bare to tempt Agatha’s wandering eyes. She looked like she belonged here, like the earth had shaped itself around her, like the wildflowers had bloomed just to be near her.</p><p> </p><p>And even though Rio wasn’t looking at her, Agatha knew she could feel it. The weight of her gaze, the slow drag of her eyes over every inch of exposed skin. Knew it in the way Rio’s fingers hesitated against the ring, in the small, barely there hitch of her breath. She held herself still, kept her eyes fixed ahead, pretending not to notice. But Agatha saw the anticipation in the tight set of her shoulders, the small inhale that she thought might go unnoticed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for Rio’s right hand with her own, the movement forcing her to twist slightly, turning into Rio as their bodies pressed together. Her left arm draped across Rio’s back, settling around her with easy familiarity, while their joined hands rested atop Rio’s right thigh. The touch was casual in appearance, but there was nothing casual about the way Agatha’s eyes bore into the side of her wife’s face, watching, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>Rio remained locked ahead, unmoving, pretending not to notice.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bit her bottom lip, heat pooling deep in her stomach. Oh, she fucking loved this. The slow tease, the game of control, the way Rio sat there, pretending like she wasn’t feeling every second of it. Agatha wanted to push, to see how long her wife could hold out, how long she could sit there all composed and unreadable when Agatha was touching her like this.</p><p> </p><p>Her palm pressed flush against the back of Rio’s hand, fingers lying between hers, guiding every movement. Slowly, she pressed their hands against Rio’s thigh, feeling the warmth of her skin through the thin fabric. Rio felt it too, her own palm flattened against her thigh, caught between Agatha’s touch and the heat of her own skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t rush. She let the moment stretch, let Rio feel every small shift as their hands moved together. With the lightest pressure, she guided Rio’s palm along the curve of her own thigh, tracing the path Agatha wanted her to follow. Her fingers curled slightly, catching the hem of Rio’s dress, and then, with slow, measured movements, she pushed it higher. The fabric bunched beneath their hands, gathering in delicate folds before slipping up again, dragging over smooth skin, catching against Rio’s fingertips before falling away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face stayed unreadable, gaze still locked on the field, but Agatha caught it- the smallest twitch of her eye when the breeze rolled over newly bared skin, the way goosebumps prickled along her thigh, giving her away. She was holding herself still, letting Agatha play. But Agatha could feel the tension in her fingers, the way her breath had slowed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha guided their hands between fabric and skin, slipping beneath the hem of Rio’s dress with unhurried intent. The fabric sat askew on her thighs, one side pushed higher than the other, exposing smooth skin, though it still covered where Agatha knew Rio was aching for her to touch. But there was no rush. Waiting only made it sweeter.</p><p> </p><p>She leaned in, brushing her nose lightly along the side of Rio’s cheek, barely a whisper of contact. She felt the smallest jerk of Rio’s head, the briefest instinct to turn into Agatha, to chase the touch, before she stopped herself. Holding still. Holding back. Refusing to give in.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled away, just enough to leave the space open between them again, just enough to remind Rio that she was choosing to deny herself.  She still looked composed, still unreadable, but Agatha didn’t miss the slight parting of her lips, the way her breath came just a fraction slower than before. It wasn’t much, barely noticeable, but it was there. A small fracture in her restraint, a quiet betrayal of just how much she wanted this.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stilled their hands, letting them settle on the inside of Rio’s exposed thigh. She tightened her grip, her fingers pressing firmly against Rio’s, squeezing just enough to make her feel it. Just enough to make her aware of every point of contact between them.</p><p> </p><p>With the arm draped around Rio’s shoulders, Agatha let her other hand wander, trailing light, teasing circles over the bare skin where her fingers hung over the side. Slow, delicate strokes, each one deliberate. She traced her way to the back of Rio’s shoulder, then followed the thin string of her dress with the tip of her finger, dragging it up the soft curve of her scapula. Her touch lingered as she reached the bow that held the dress in place at the top of her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Then, with one movement, she took the bow between her thumb and index finger and pulled.</p><p> </p><p>The knot came undone effortlessly. The left side of Rio’s dress loosened, the fabric slipping down in a soft, slow cascade. It barely made a sound, just the whisper of cloth against skin as it fell, exposing the curve of her breast to the open air.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had already known what she would find before the fabric even slipped away. She had seen the way Rio’s nipples had hardened, her body already betraying her long before Agatha had even touched her.</p><p> </p><p>And then, the smallest sound. Barely there. A breath, a quiet, minuscule gasp. Rio’s shoulders dropped forward, the tension slipping from them in the slightest release, her breath turning uneven, more ragged than before. Her eyes fluttered, struggling to stay open, fighting against the instinct to let go.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s thighs parted just a little wider. Agatha felt the it beneath her palm, a silent invitation.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tightened her grip on Rio’s hand, still resting between her thighs, feeling the heat of her skin beneath their palms. She guided it upward, not yet giving in, stopping just before the place they both wanted her most. An intentional tease. Instead, she shifted their hands higher, gliding over the curve of Rio’s torso, letting their fingertips brush over her ribs before finally pressing their joined palms against the bare swell of her breast.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed, pressing her hand over Rio’s, forcing her to feel the pressure, to acknowledge her own touch beneath Agatha’s. Rio’s fingers twitched under hers, responding instinctively even as she held herself still. Her breath caught, her chin tipping up, lips parting just enough to bite down on the sound threatening to escape. The restraint was a challenge, one Agatha desperately wanted to break.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha guided Rio’s hand over her own breast, keeping her palm firm over the back of her wife’s hand, making her feel every movement, every shift. She let Rio knead herself, let her own fingers skim along the soft skin, before tilting their hands just enough for her fingertips to graze the bud of her nipple. A teasing touch, fleeting and featherlight, before she moved again, catching it between one of her own fingers and one of Rio’s. A small squeeze, trapping the sensitive peak between them, rolling it just enough to send a shudder through Rio’s body.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the pulse of her own arousal between her legs, the gentle ache building as Rio pushed into the touch, her body betraying her self control.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t give Rio time to recover. Agatha dragged their hands down Rio’s body again, over the smooth plane of her stomach, down the expanse of her exposed thigh. She lingered just long enough to let the anticipation stretch, Agatha’s own breath uneven now, thick with her own excitement. She was just as affected, just as desperate to get where she was going.</p><p> </p><p>Their fingers skimmed back up, gliding along the soft skin of Rio’s inner thigh, higher and higher until Agatha pushed their hands beneath the fabric of her dress. She pressed her palm over the back of Rio’s hand, pushing her wife to cup herself, only to be met with bare, heated skin.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath, realization settling fast and hot. Rio had a habit of going without underwear, especially in dresses, a quiet indulgence her wife never acknowledged but always enjoyed. Whatever smugness she might have felt about it shattered the second their hands made contact. Her hips gave the smallest involuntary buck, a desperate attempt to chase more, her body acting before she could stop it.</p><p> </p><p>The movement of Rio’s hips beneath their touch sent a sharp jolt of need through Agatha, her pulse hammering in response. Smug or not, Rio was already aching for her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gasped, the sound wrecked and wanting. "Agatha." Her name, nothing more, but the way it was pulled from Rio’s lips -breathless, needy- sent a fire straight through Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head fell forward, resting against Rio’s temple, her eyes falling shut at the sound. Even with just the minimal contact, her fingers barely brushing between Rio’s, she could feel everything. How soaked she was, how their fingers slid through the slick mess of her, dripping and obscene, a pool of wetness that left no room for denial. It clung to their skin, spread between their fingers, proof of just how badly Rio needed this, how ready she was. </p><p> </p><p>She curled her hand just slightly, pressing her palm into Rio’s, adding just enough pressure for the smallest bit of friction against her clit. Rio made a sound, choked and stifled, but Agatha knew exactly what it would look like. She could picture it- the way Rio’s teeth would catch her bottom lip, the way she would try to swallow it down, a failed attempt at keeping quiet when there was no use in it at all.</p><p> </p><p>And then, Agatha pulled her hand away.</p><p> </p><p>She could feel Rio’s breathing change, the sharp intake of air as she processed the loss. She didn’t move her head from where it rested against Rio’s temple, even when she felt her wife turn toward her, just slightly, just enough to chase. A brush of Agatha’s lips against her cheek, desperate enough to take whatever contact she could get, like even that could make up for the loss of Agatha’s hand.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her eyes closed a moment longer, steadying herself. If she looked too soon, if she let herself see Rio now, she would break. She would give in immediately, would lose herself in the sight of what she had done to her.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha wanted to savor this first.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to take in the way Rio looked undone before she touched her again, the way her body held the magnitude of her need. Agatha wanted to let it linger, to drink in the desperation written across her wife’s face before finally giving her what they both wanted. If she didn’t pace herself, if she didn’t hold out just a little longer, she wouldn’t last.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled away from where she had rested against Rio’s temple, keeping her eyes closed prolonging the moment to anchor herself, as if control could steady the heat pressing deep in her stomach. She moved slowly, carefully, putting just enough distance between them to see her wife. She didn’t hurry. She let it build, let suspense coil tighter around her, let herself exist in the last few seconds of power she had left.</p><p> </p><p>She only opened her eyes when she felt it, Rio’s breath ghosting over her lips.</p><p> </p><p>And what Agatha saw stole the air from her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked ruined.</p><p> </p><p>Her pupils had swallowed the golden brown of her eyes, wide and unfocused, the edges blurred like she was somewhere between reality and whatever haze Agatha had pulled her into. Her eyelids fought to stay open, heavy with want, on the verge of slipping shut just to keep herself from having to endure the wait any longer. Her lips, parted and swollen, looked as though they had been kissed raw, but Agatha hadn’t even kissed her yet. She had only watched as Rio bit at them, chewed them between her teeth in some useless attempt to swallow down the sounds threatening to spill.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body told the same story. One breast exposed to the open air, chest rising and falling in slow  pulls, each breath feeling conscious, like she was trying to keep herself from falling apart too soon. The fabric of her dress sat bunched high at her hips, twisted and askew, a mess of folds where Agatha had pushed it out of her way. Her thighs remained parted, another silent request, and between them, exactly where Agatha had left her, Rio’s hand rested against herself, fingers still and trembling slightly, too tense, too aware of how little she had been given.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t need to touch her to feel it. It was in the air, in the heat radiating off her skin, in the way every inch of her wife’s body waited.</p><p> </p><p>She looked exquisite. She looked wrecked. She looked like she had been torn apart, left trembling and empty, waiting for Agatha to pull her back together again.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha would.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for Rio’s hand, still resting between her thighs, and brought it to her mouth. Her eyes never left Rio’s as she pressed her tongue to the heel of her palm, dragging it slowly up the entire length, savoring the taste of her against her tongue. It was intoxicating, a taste so familiar yet one that drove her insane every time. A low moan slipped from Agatha’s lips, shameless and indulgent, vibrating against Rio’s skin, letting her feel just how much she enjoyed it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a quiet, broken whimper.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her hand fall back between them, but she didn't look away. She watched the way her wife's lips hung open like she had tried to speak and forgotten how. Her pupils were blown, her expression stripped of anything but want.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard, tried again, her tongue running over her lips, wetting them without thought, “Please.”</p><p> </p><p>It came out wrecked, barely more than a whisper, but Agatha heard it. She heard everything in it. The way Rio had abandoned every ounce of control she had left. Even her voice had given in, shaking and needy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cupped Rio’s cheek, her thumb tracing the edge of her cheekbone. The moment she touched her, Rio melted into it, her lashes fluttering as she tilted her chin up, offering herself without hesitation. She felt the way Rio trembled under her touch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t kiss her. Not where her wife wanted her to. Instead, she let her lips wander, skimming over her jaw, brushing against the corner of her mouth, teasing, never lingering.</p><p> </p><p>"Agatha, please. I need you."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to meet her gaze, her lips curling slightly as she hummed, "You beg so pretty."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha crashed their mouths together, swallowing every sound Rio made, drinking in every gasp, every sharp inhale taking them for herself. Her tongue slid against hers, leaving Rio with no space to do anything but accept it. She licked into her mouth, wet and messy, sucked at her bottom lip before biting down just enough to make Rio jolt against her. The kiss was relentless, nothing soft or careful about it, their lips slick from the desperation pooling between them.</p><p> </p><p>One of Agatha’s hands fisted in Rio’s dress, the other gripping at her waist, pulling, telling her exactly what she wanted without a word. Rio got the hint, shifting onto her knees, climbing into Agatha’s lap without hesitation. She settled against her, her legs bracketing Agatha’s waist, pressing down so firmly that Agatha could feel the heat of her through the layer of fabric of her pants. It sent a deep, aching pull through her, made her fingers dig into Rio’s skin, made the kiss grow hungrier, rougher, consuming.</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere between all of it, Rio’s trembling hands moved between them, fumbling with the buttons of Agatha’s shirt. She managed to undo half of them, pushing her hands through the opening instead, desperate to feel skin against her palms. She dragged her hands over Agatha’s back, smoothing them along her shoulders, curling her fingers where she could reach.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha broke away, panting, needing to see her. Rio stayed in her lap, looking down at her, lips swollen, hair slightly undone from where Agatha had pulled at it. It should have made her look insane, but it didn’t. It made her look even more perfect, like this was how she was meant to be, breathless and open and completely Agatha’s. One breast was still bare, her chest rising in deep, uneven breaths, her skin flushed and warm under Agatha’s touch. Her eyes burned with something Agatha wanted to drown in. It made her fingers tighten at Rio’s waist, made her breath catch in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>She reached up, fingers curling around the bow at Rio’s shoulder, tugging it loose. The top half of Rio’s dress gave under gravity, the fabric falling from her completely, cascading down before settling at her waist.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze dragged over her, taking in every inch, letting herself have this, letting herself see. The curve of her waist, the delicate slope of her collarbones, the faint lines where Agatha’s hands had gripped too tightly. She looked like something unreal, something untouchable, and yet she was right here, sitting in her lap, waiting, watching.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her hands slide down her sides, palms warm against bare skin, her voice quiet when she finally spoke.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, the sharp edges of her desire melting into something deeper, something Agatha felt like she could fall into if she wasn’t careful. Both hands slid into Agatha’s hair, fingers threading through the strands with a touch so careful it made Agatha’s chest ache. She leaned forward, letting her forehead rest gently against Agatha’s, their breaths mingling in the space between them.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d do anything for you,” Rio whispered, the words were so quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted. <em>A lie.</em> Not an intentional one, not something Rio meant to be untrue, but Agatha knew better. There was one thing Rio wouldn’t do for her.</p><p> </p><p>The question slipped out before she could stop herself. </p><p> </p><p>“Tell me you’d walk away from it, if I asked you to.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio stilled.</p><p> </p><p>Not just in the way one does when caught off guard, but in a way that felt like the whole world had stopped with her. Like time had drawn a breath and held it, waiting. Her body was still, too still, yet Agatha could see the flickers of movement within her- her fingers tensing, her throat working around a swallow she never took, the barest shift of her expression like the words had reached inside her and curled around something untouched. Something unknown even to herself.</p><p> </p><p>Then, Rio flinched. It was slight but Agatha caught it. The subtle recoil, the way she turned her head just enough, chin tucking, eyes dropping away like she couldn’t bear to hold Agatha’s gaze. A sudden, quiet inhale, a wretched twist of her brows like something had struck her straight through the ribs, unseen but devastating all the same.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew that look. It was betrayal.</p><p> </p><p>The moment Rio hesitated, the moment she allowed herself to consider, she had betrayed the very thing she was.</p><p> </p><p>Because Death does not hesitate. Death does not question. Death does not want.</p><p> </p><p>And yet, Agatha thinks, Rio had done all three.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw the realization settle in, the way Rio's breath faltered, the way her gaze fell hoping she could avoid the truth by refusing to look at it. She had done something unforgivable in her own eyes. She had doubted. She had wanted. </p><p> </p><p>Then guilt flashed across Rio’s face, quick and fleeting. Agatha watched as her wife’s eyes flickered, darting toward the bench under them, locking there. It was as if she was looking for an answer in the wood grain, in the silence, in anything that wasn’t Agatha. But there was nothing there.</p><p> </p><p>So, after a moment, she pulled her gaze away and looked at Agatha again.</p><p> </p><p>Really looked at her.</p><p> </p><p>She reached for Agatha then, one hand slipping from Agatha’s hair to her cheek. Her fingers barely brushed against Agatha’s skin, hesitant, like she wasn’t sure if she was even real. Her other hand followed, cradling Agatha’s face, thumbs ghosting over her cheekbones searching for proof.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her own breath catch, her fingers digging tighter into Rio’s bare back. She didn’t know why she was suddenly terrified that Rio might let go, that she might say something so fucking stupid, so utterly irreversible, that it would tear through whatever fragile thing that was holding them together right now.</p><p> </p><p>"You’d ask me to?"</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha swore she felt the world tilt.</p><p> </p><p>Her heart slammed against her ribs. Her mouth parted, but she had no words.</p><p> </p><p>She had expected defiance. A refusal, a scoff, a roll of the eyes- something that made it clear Rio was untouchable, that she was still the entity Agatha had spent lifetimes cursing. But instead, Rio was looking at her like she had just realized something that changed everything.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t an answer. It was a question.</p><p> </p><p>A question that curled around Agatha’s throat and squeezed. One that held her captive, made her forget how to breathe. Because Rio hadn’t said no.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha didn’t know if that was a mercy or the beginning of something far worse. Because hope was insidious, a whispering thing that wormed its way into the cracks of reason, tapping at the base of her skull like a restless finger against glass. It tapped and tapped, feverish and impatient, drumming inside her mind, demanding to be let in.</p><p> </p><p>All Agatha could do was lift her shoulders in a weak shrug, the motion as empty as the breath she barely managed to take. The pressure of it settled deep, pushing into her very bones. She was tired. Tired of fighting. Tired of sharing Rio with something endless, something she could never hold.</p><p> </p><p>Rio might have lied to her earlier, had even silently given away that she had thought about a life where she could, but she never indulged in it, not even with Agatha. The very laws of Death's were written into her bones, it was supposed to be instinct.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re not supposed to hesitate.” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t an accusation. It wasn’t a demand. It was closer to pleading. She needed Rio to take it back. To scoff. To roll her eyes. To be an ass to Agatha, anything to shatter the hope tapping at the base of her skull waiting to sink its teeth in the moment she let her guard down.</p><p> </p><p>“I know.”</p><p> </p><p>A confession wrapped in regret. </p><p> </p><p>Then Rio kissed her. There was no hesitation, no restraint, just the desperate press of her mouth, the slow, rolling drag of her hips against Agatha’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>Death hadn’t been quiet for a second.</p><p> </p><p>Not when Agatha pushed into her, not when she rocked her wife harder, not when Rio found the rhythm that wrecked her and chased it like she needed it. She moaned against Agatha’s lips, gasped when fingers curled inside her, cursed when pleasure struck too sudden and too much. Her hands fisted in Agatha’s hair, nails scraping, breath breaking apart into something ragged, something hungry, something that had never belonged to Death before.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio shattered.</p><p> </p><p>Her whole body tensed, back arching, thighs squeezing tight around Agatha’s waist. Her voice broke as she came, loud and shameless, soaking Agatha’s fingers, panting Agatha's name between gasping, trembling breaths. Even as pleasure wrecked through her, she kept moving, kept grinding down, chasing every last wave of it like she never wanted it to end.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her through it, pressing slow kisses into her throat, hands smoothing down her back, feeling the tremors still shaking through her body.</p><p> </p><p>She had hesitated.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha would never forget how she sounded when she did.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha used to hate spring.</p><p> </p><p>She had hated the way the green came back too fast, filling every barren space as if it had been waiting for the chance. It never asked permission, never considered whether it was wanted. It just returned, bold and unrelenting, creeping over stone, pushing through cracks, climbing higher, stretching further, refusing to stay buried.</p><p> </p><p>Spring had never known when to quit.</p><p> </p><p>But now, in the thick of it, she no longer felt the urge to curse its return.</p><p> </p><p>The green was still here, still spreading, still refusing to be anything but alive, but she didn’t hate it for that. It didn’t feel insufferable, didn’t feel like something clawing its way back just to taunt her. It had come back because it always would. Because that was what it did. Because nothing -not time, not distance, not even death- could keep it from coming home again.</p><p> </p><p>And for the first time, Agatha thought that maybe she had never really wanted it to stop.</p><p>

<p>Summer:</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had always hated summer.</p><p> </p><p>Spring was relentless, but summer was smothering. It took. It swallowed everything whole, draping itself over the world with an insufferable heat, with air too thick to breathe, with skies so bright it left nowhere to hide.</p><p> </p><p>There was no silence in summer, no reprieve, no space left untouched. It was inescapable, lingering on skin, clinging to breath, pressing in from all sides. It stretched the days too long, made the nights too short, left no corner of the world untouched by its presence.</p><p> </p><p>Summer demanded. It took. It burned.</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha had never been able to stand the way it never let her forget it was there.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>At dawn, Agatha sat curled up on the couch with her first coffee of the morning, flipping through yet another painfully dull book on botany. Outside, Rio was already in the garden, tackling the overgrown mess that spring had left behind.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had just started debating whether she actually cared about soil pH when a loud bang made her jump. Sage’s door flew open, smacking into the wall with enough force to shake the house.</p><p> </p><p>Sage never entered a room quietly. She had no concept of subtlety. Whatever patience Rio had for moving through the world unnoticed had clearly skipped over their daughter entirely. She moved like she wanted the whole house to know she was awake and expected them to be impressed by it.</p><p> </p><p>But what threw Agatha off wasn’t the dramatics. It was the fact that Sage was even awake.</p><p> </p><p>Lately, she had been getting up earlier, slipping out of bed not long after Agatha and Rio started their day. More often than not, she ended up outside with Rio, helping her work in the garden. Agatha had noticed it happening more during spring, though she had yet to understand why.</p><p> </p><p>Sage stomped down the stairs, footsteps loud and completely unbothered by the idea that mornings were meant to be quiet.</p><p> </p><p>The moment Sage’s footsteps hit the bottom of the stairs, Agatha was ready to snap at her for the unnecessary racket. But the words never left her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Sage strolled into the living room, completely unaware of the reaction she had just pulled from her mother. She was wearing those old green coveralls, the ones she had shamelessly stolen from Rio. The fabric was worn, soft from use, the name <em> VIDAL </em> stitched across the chest pocket. But it didn’t just read <em> VIDAL </em> anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Now, there was a dash after <em> VIDAL </em> , and beneath it, neatly embroidered, was <em> HARKNESS </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart soared at the sight of it.</p><p> </p><p>She knew exactly when it had happened. </p><p> </p><p>
<em> One spring evening, she had wandered into the study and found Rio teaching Sage how to sew. At first, she had assumed it was something simple, maybe how to fix a tear, and Agatha hadn’t thought much of it. She had flopped onto an armchair with a book, feigning interest in the pages while stealing glances over the top, completely absorbed in the moment unfolding in front of her. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She had watched the way Rio guided Sage’s hands, patient and unhurried, explaining each movement with the same careful attention she gave to her plants. Sage, in turn, had been enthralled, not just listening but absorbing everything. She had even corrected Rio a few times, referencing some tutorial she had seen, and rather than argue, Rio had simply nodded and adjusted, as if it made perfect sense. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha had found herself wondering what it was like when she wasn’t there. She could picture it, the way Rio would teach Sage about anything and everything, never talking down to her, never dismissing a question as too small or too complicated. She imagined the quiet understanding between them, the way Rio could spend hours explaining something if Sage asked, and the way Sage would take in every word like it mattered. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>And now, staring at her own last name stitched beneath Rio’s, she realized just how much it did.</p><p> </p><p>As if her heart could take any more, Sage held up a hairbrush and asked if Agatha would braid her hair before she went out to help Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely managed a nod. When Sage sat on the floor between her legs, leaning back against the couch, she casually mentioned that she wanted French braids.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t stupid. Sage was more than capable of braiding her own hair. And if she couldn’t, she would have figured it out in minutes or asked Rio to show her. But that wasn’t the point. She wanted Agatha to do it. That realization nearly made her heart explode.</p><p> </p><p>They sat in comfortable silence, Sage’s focus shifting to whatever reality show she had put on. She was hardly ever quiet, always filling the silence with thoughts, commentary, and noise. But the moment Agatha started brushing her hair, running her fingers through it to part it properly, Sage settled. Like this was something she had always done. Like this was something that had always been theirs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had always been the same way. Centuries ago, Agatha used to braid her hair just like this, with Rio sitting between her legs, quieting the second Agatha’s fingers ran through it.</p><p> </p><p>It had always caught Agatha off guard, the way Rio eased into her touch without resistance. How something as simple as braiding her hair could quiet her, make her still in a way nothing else could. It felt like holding something rare, something no one else ever got to see. Like, for a moment, Rio wasn’t Death. Rio was just hers<em> . </em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt it all settle in her chest. The familiarity of it. The way history repeated itself in the smallest, quietest moments.</p><p> </p><p>It had struck Agatha, the way they both reacted the same way. Neither of them had ever been particularly quiet, at least not in a way that felt natural. Rio had a habit of always being, always existing in a space with purpose, whether she spoke or not. Sage, on the other hand, made herself known. Loud footsteps, aggressive movements, a constant presence that demanded to be felt. But the moment Agatha’s fingers wove through their hair, both of them went still.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands slowed for a brief moment before she continued, fingers weaving through the strands with the same care she had once given Rio. The same care she had once given Nicky.</p><p> </p><p>And now, with Sage sitting between her legs in those old green coveralls, the name <em> VIDAL-HARKNESS </em>stitched across the chest, it hit her all at once.</p><p> </p><p>This had never been about the braids. It had never been about needing help. It was about Sage choosing her. It was about all the little pieces of herself she had quietly placed in Agatha’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure she had the words to explain it, but she knew what it felt like. It felt like something that had always belonged to her finding its way back.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat at the patio table, the morning air still cool enough to be pleasant before the heat of the day set in. Once the temperature climbed too high, Rio would have to force Sage inside, especially since she was the only one of the three who could actually suffer from a heat stroke.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> A few weeks ago, Sage had been working outside with Rio when she suddenly collapsed. Agatha hadn’t been there. She had been inside, avoiding the heat, because even if it couldn’t kill her, that didn’t mean she enjoyed sitting in it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She hadn’t heard anything at first, just the usual quiet of the house, until the back door slammed open and Rio’s voice rang through the house, calling for her. Agatha was off the couch in an instant, barely processing what was happening before she saw Rio rushing inside, Sage limp in her arms. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fear surged through her as she threw question after question at Rio, her mind scrambling for answers faster than her wife could give them. Rio, breathless and frantic, managed to explain, already moving to lay Sage down on the couch. The moment Sage’s back hit the cushions, she shot upright and vomited all over the floor. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> For a second, the room went completely silent. Sage stared down at the mess, then looked up at them with a weak grin. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Well, I feel better.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha exhaled sharply, pressing her fingers to her temples as Rio muttered something under her breath. They cleaned up the mess and took care of Sage, making sure she was hydrated and stable, but before Agatha could tear into either of them for being so careless, Rio leveled Sage with a look, arms crossed as she stood over her. "Next time, you'll listen to me when I tell you to go inside." </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Sage, still slumped on the couch, lifted a hand and gave a weak thumbs up. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Ever since that day, Agatha spent her mornings outside, watching over them as they worked. She knew she didn’t need to. If Sage got too stubborn, Rio would handle it without hesitation. Agatha had never once doubted that.</p><p> </p><p>But she still stayed.</p><p> </p><p>She told herself it was to back Rio up, to make sure Sage didn’t argue, to step in if needed. But that wasn’t the real reason.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just wanted to be there.</p><p> </p><p>And they wanted her there too.</p><p> </p><p>She had spent too long on the outside, watching their lives move without her, convincing herself it was easier that way. For even longer, she hadn't been part of it at all. Now she was here, in the middle of it, no longer a visitor in her own family.</p><p> </p><p>Rio never questioned her presence. Sage never complained. They expected her there the same way they expected the sun to rise. She was part of the routine now, part of them, and no one asked her to leave.</p><p> </p><p>So she stayed.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Today, Agatha sat at the patio table, watching Rio and Sage work in the garden. Rio wore a white tank top, now smudged with dirt, streaks of soil marking her face and arms. She had on shorts, her legs just as stained. Sage’s hair was braided in two French braids, the way she always asked for now. Her daughter wore those ridiculous coveralls that always made Agatha’s heart lurch, a black tank top visible underneath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha folded her arms, watching them, but her mind kept drifting.</p><p> </p><p>She exhaled slowly, forcing herself to look away from Rio and Sage. The rising sun cast shadows across the patio, stretching toward her like grasping fingers. Agatha should’ve let it go by now. That moment in spring. The hesitation. It had been months, but it still lived in the back of her skull, a splinter she couldn’t pry out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha never brought it up again. She didn’t want to. There was nothing left to question. Rio sure as shit hadn’t either, and life had settled into its usual shape. Everything had been normal for it, clean and simple, with nothing else blurred, nothing else left open ended. No more hesitation. No new false hope.</p><p> </p><p>For now, that was enough. </p><p> </p><p>Until Sage wandered onto the patio, moving slower than usual, and took a seat at the table. Not in her usual chair. Not across from Agatha. Instead, she chose the one diagonal from her, the one facing the garden directly.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t say anything right away. She only watched Rio, her face unreadable, though the slight furrow of her brow gave her away. Agatha hadn’t been able to take her eyes off of her daughter since the moment she sat down, waiting, knowing Sage never did anything without a reason.</p><p> </p><p>When Sage finally caught Agatha staring, she didn’t acknowledge it. Instead, she turned back to the garden, her eyes still not leaving Rio. Only then did she open that beautifully stupid mouth of hers.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you think she’s been acting weird recently?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely stopped herself from smacking a hand to her face. This was exactly the kind of conversation she wanted to avoid.</p><p> </p><p>She had no answer, not one she was willing to give. Maybe Rio had been acting weird, or maybe Agatha had spent too much time convincing herself that nothing had changed. Either way, she was absolutely not about to poke a very large bear with a stick just to have it maul her face off.</p><p> </p><p>But maybe Sage’s question wasn’t meant to be as heavy as it felt. Maybe she was just curious, nothing more. Agatha decided to play along, to slam the door in the face of that insidious little thing tapping at the back of her skull and pretend it had never dared to knock in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>“What do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>“She’s been calling me into the garden almost every day since spring.”</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked at Sage, then at Rio, then back at Sage, trying to find the flaw in the statement, the crack in logic that would let her dismiss it outright. She scoffed before she could stop herself, shaking her head.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s a stretch.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage finally turned to look at her, unimpressed.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re obsessed with her,” Agatha said flatly. “You’d follow her into a volcano if she so much as gestured in the general direction of one. I haven’t seen her ask you for help once.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s not like that,” she said. Her fingers twitched slightly before pressing to her chest, thumb brushing over the fabric of her coveralls. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s grip on her arms tightened, but she kept her expression neutral. She knew that gesture. Knew it before Sage even opened her mouth again.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Double fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Sage exhaled through her nose, “I don’t know.” The admission sounded like it irritated her, which was a rare thing. Sage always knew. “At first, I didn’t think much of it. But it’s been every day. Almost like… she has to see me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had never wanted to exit a conversation more in her entire life.</p><p> </p><p>She needed this to be nothing. Agatha desperately needed this to be nothing. She needed Sage to be overthinking, overanalyzing, to be making connections where there were none. She needed her to be wrong because the alternative was not an option.</p><p> </p><p>Forcing herself to keep her voice even, Agatha shrugged, feigning indifference. “Maybe you’re reading too much into it.”</p><p> </p><p>A grunt came from the back of Sage's throat. “Maybe.” But the word was empty, her mind already turning over a hundred different possibilities.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did not like that.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha's gaze flicked back to Rio, who was -<em> completely fine, by the way </em>- just working in the garden like she always did, moving through it like nothing had changed. But Sage was still rubbing at her chest like there was something wrong, and now Agatha couldn’t stop noticing it.</p><p> </p><p>This was fine.</p><p> </p><p>This was so fine.</p><p> </p><p>Everything was fine.</p><p> </p><p>And if Agatha said it enough times in her head, maybe she would start to believe it.</p><p> </p><p>“I think you’d be a book critic.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s voice yanked Agatha from her thoughts so abruptly she barely registered what she had said. She turned to her daughter, narrowing her eyes. “I’m lost.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t miss a beat. “I asked you a few months ago what you’d do if you were never a witch. You didn’t give me a real answer.” She tilted her head, considering. “So… book critic.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t immediately hate the idea. In fact, the more she thought about it, the better it sounded. She could make a career out of ruining someone’s day with a single well placed review. She would absolutely tear apart books for minor infractions just to watch authors spiral into existential crises over their “craft.” She’d relish the outraged responses, the desperate attempts to justify bad dialogue, the readers foaming at the mouth in the comments.</p><p> </p><p>Hell, she’d probably even trash a perfectly decent book just to piss people off. Something beloved. Something precious. She could singlehandedly destroy an entire literary fandom with one scathing, elegantly worded critique.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Now that was power. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had no idea how they had gotten here, but she was more than happy to abandon their previous conversation. If they were going to talk about something, it might as well be how much fun she would have making other people miserable.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I guess if I’d have to do something, I might as well ruin lives while I’m at it,” Agatha said, she could feel her smirk creeping in.</p><p> </p><p>Sage breathed a huff of a laugh, shaking her head. “You’d be the most feared name in publishing.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha fucking loved the sound of that.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood in front of the shelves, staring at the endless rows of books that stretched from floor to ceiling. There were thousands of them, covering every subject imaginable, but she had been standing in the same spot for far too long. She told herself she was just browsing, that it was a coincidence she kept lingering in front of the books on plants and cultivation. One arm folded across her body, the other resting atop it, fingers cradling her chin as she feigned contemplation, though she already knew exactly where her attention would land.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fucking botany. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She willed herself to look at something else. Anything else. But her gaze kept drifting back to the pages filled with delicate sketches of plants, to the ink smudged notes scrawled in the margins, to the books that smelled like earth and sunlight even after years on the shelf.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was bored of them.</p><p> </p><p>Or at least, that was the lie she clung to.</p><p> </p><p>A big, fat, enormous lie.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved them. She loved knowing what Rio knew. She loved understanding the things that made her wife’s eyes brighten, the things that could turn a simple comment into an hours long conversation. She loved how Rio would engage, how she would lean in with that barely concealed excitement, how she would listen, truly listen, when Agatha spoke. She knew Sage could keep up just as well, maybe even better, but this was different. This was Rio looking at Agatha like she was part of something that belonged to just the two of them. Like she was stepping into something sacred, a world that existed between them and no one else.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t think she could ever touch the depths of it, could ever reach the end of this boundless thing between them. It stretched beyond her understanding, like an ocean without a shore. She was only just beginning to realize how much of herself it had already claimed, how impossible it would be to ever pull away.</p><p> </p><p>The gentle drag of fingers through the ends of her hair pulled her from her thoughts. A shiver ran down her spine, her arms falling slack at her sides as her eyes fluttered shut. She exhaled softly, barely suppressing the quiet moan that slipped past her lips.</p><p> </p><p>Rio always managed to move without a sound, slipping in unnoticed until she wanted to be felt. It was infuriating at times- Agatha could never quite figure out how she did it- but right now, with those fingers trailing through her hair like they didn’t belong anywhere else, she couldn’t bring herself to mind.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned, drawn by the need to see her wife. When their eyes met, Rio was already watching her, her teeth grazing her bottom lip. There was no hesitation, no guarded silence- just a certainty that they didn’t have to question anymore, a love that had already been fought for, already won.</p><p> </p><p>She reached for Rio without thinking, cupping her face before pulling her in, arms wrapping around her. Her fingers pressed against the back of Rio’s head, holding her there, refusing to let go. Rio melted into her, chin pressing into her shoulder, her arms winding just as tightly around Agatha’s waist. They stayed like that, breathing the same air, hearts beating just a little too fast.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio finally pulled back, Agatha wasn’t ready. She smoothed a piece of hair behind Rio’s ear, fingertips trailing along her jaw before settling against her cheeks. Agatha's thumbs brushed over her skin as her gaze dropped to Rio’s lips for just a second, before she lifted her eyes again, locking onto the familiar brown she had loved for lifetimes.</p><p> </p><p>"I love you so much," Agatha whispered, simply because it was the truest thing she had ever known.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled her bottom lip between her teeth again, her gaze lingering on Agatha’s mouth. Agatha still held her face in her hands. Slowly, Rio’s eyes lifted, searching hers with an intensity that made Agatha’s breath catch.</p><p> </p><p>Her brow furrowed just slightly, as her hands settled around Agatha’s wrists, holding them with a gentle firmness. Her voice barely rose above a whisper, "Do you have any idea what you’ve done to me?" It sounded holy in its breaking, like a prayer that had never belonged to any god- only to Agatha. Words Rio would only ever speak in the dark.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brows pulled together, her thoughts muddled by the warmth of her wife’s hands on her wrists and the way Rio was looking at her. The words should have been simple, but they tangled in her mind, lost in the closeness, in the way Rio always made everything else fade away.</p><p> </p><p>Her grip tightened slightly, thumbs brushing against Rio’s cheeks. When Agatha spoke, her voice was softer than she intended, “Tell me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let her head fall forward, resting against Agatha’s, her eyes squeezing shut. A soft sigh left her, warm against Agatha’s skin. Agatha didn’t want to wait. She needed to know what was running through her wife’s mind. She needed to hear it.</p><p> </p><p>She gave Rio a moment, feeling the slow rise and fall of her breath before pulling back slightly. Her head dipped, her thumb brushing gently across Rio’s cheek.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s fingers twitched. And then, slowly, her eyes opened.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her breath catch, something inside her going still, waiting. The look in Rio’s eyes was too familiar, a hesitation that sent a cold, sinking feeling through her.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> No. Not this. Not again. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Not here, not now. Not in a way that would slip into spaces she had tried to seal shut, tapping at her mind with quiet persistence. It never stopped. It never faded. A restless thing, pacing, pushing, waiting for the smallest crack to force its way through.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Hope. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>There was too much at stake. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t just about them, not just about the way their bodies fit together, like they had been carved from the same story, like no force in existence could pull them apart and still leave them whole. Not just about the way Rio looked at her, as if Agatha had spun the very world into motion, as if every step she had ever taken had led her to this moment, to this touch, to this choice.</p><p> </p><p>Love had never been that simple for them. It had never existed in a world untouched by consequence.</p><p> </p><p>Their hands, their choices, had shaped too much, had left marks on their world that could not be undone. There was a balance to uphold, a cycle that couldn’t bend for selfishness, no matter how much Agatha wanted it to. No matter how much Rio deserved more than the eternal life she had been given. </p><p> </p><p>It was a reminder that this was never just about what Agatha wanted. But the enormity of it was smothering, leaving no room to escape. That kind of future loomed before them, demanding a sacrifice neither of them were willing to make.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to believe that love was enough, that after everything, after centuries of pain and sacrifice, it should fucking count for something. But duty didn’t give a shit about love, and Fate sure as fuck didn’t bargain with it.</p><p> </p><p>It was foolish. It was dangerous. But despite it all, Agatha couldn’t stop herself from wanting it. In fact, she wanted it so badly she thought it might kill her.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio was looking at her like she was seeing something her wife had always known yet never let herself linger on, like the truth had been there all along- only now, she was willing to give it voice.</p><p> </p><p>“No.” The word came quickly, breaking the silence before Rio could. Agatha could feel it, the moment about to tip into something neither of them could afford. These were only words. They would change nothing. They would solve nothing. And yet, if her wife said them, if she gave them meaning, Agatha knew she would never be able to escape them.</p><p> </p><p>She knew they would split through her like a crack she had spent too long ignoring, not breaking, not healing, just waiting. She had buried it, forced it into silence where it couldn’t touch her. As long as the words lived so far buried in Agatha’s mind, she could pretend they weren’t real.</p><p> </p><p>“You have ruined me.”</p><p> </p><p>It should have been a victory. In another life, another moment, another fight between them, Agatha would have smirked, would have twisted them into something cruel, would have used them as a weapon to slice away at the tenderness Rio was so recklessly exposing. </p><p> </p><p>But Agatha’s blood ran cold. She tried to stop Rio again.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha's voice was quiet, uncertain, as her hands found Rio’s shoulders, grasping, holding, trying to steady herself.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t pause. She still didn’t acknowledge the plea in Agatha’s voice or the way her hands clung to her shoulders. Her hand came to Agatha’s cheek, her thumb brushed over her bottom lip, silently telling Agatha the moment had already been decided. Agatha’s breath caught, a quiet whimper slipping free before she could stop it. Her chest tightened, her heart stumbling over itself, unable to keep up with what was happening.</p><p> </p><p>"You-" Rio's voice wavered, betraying her. Death was not meant to tremble. But she did. Still, her wife pressed on. "You are carved into every part of me. I have rewritten myself in your name, undone and remade by the way you exist. I have crossed time with you in my mind. I have held the dying and thought only of you. I have touched the edge of nothingness and whispered for you like a fool begging for something they were never meant to have."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to pull away, but she couldn’t move. She couldn’t speak. The warmth of Rio’s hand against her cheek was a trap she had willingly walked into, a shackle made of something far worse than magic.</p><p> </p><p>She felt at war with herself. One part of her wanted to be selfish- to hear it, to let it sink its teeth into her skin, to take and take and take. The other part recoiled,  wanted to shove Rio off, to sneer, to tell her to toughen up because what was the point?  Words were just words. They didn’t change anything.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Words have never saved us before. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio pressed a soft kiss to the corner of her mouth, "You made me reach for things far beyond my place. And I have reached anyway. I have held what was never mine to hold, let it engrave itself into my bones, let it reshape me, knowing that it would ruin me. Knowing that you would ruin me."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Rio’s thumb brushed beneath her eye, swiping away the dampness there. God- had she been crying? When did that start? She was at a complete and utter loss, her mind latching onto the only thing that made sense. Rio’s touch. Warm… always warm. When it was only ever meant to be cold.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had always known how to touch her, how to speak to her in a way that made her lose herself. And right now, it felt like a betrayal. <em> Why are you saying this? </em> Agatha wanted to scream, to push her away, but the words stuck in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>"You've made a lie of everything I am." Rio exhaled a quiet, watery laugh. It wasn’t sharp or bitter- just hollow, like she had given up trying to hold it back.</p><p> </p><p>“I should’ve taken you long ago, I should’ve ended this story before it had the chance to begin. And yet, every time the moment came, I did nothing. I watched you slip through my fingers, I watched you carve out more time, more life, more defiance, and I let you…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a shuddering breath. She wanted to deny it, to say Rio was being dramatic, but still the words wouldn’t come.</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled, something unreadable flickering behind her eyes. “Not because I lacked the power to take you. Not because you ever stood a chance at escaping me.” Her thumb brushed against Agatha’s throat, a featherlight touch against the pulse that beat beneath her skin- steady, stubborn, Rio’s. “But because I didn’t want to.”</p><p> </p><p>There it was again- the notion that Rio’s power wasn’t some cold, untouchable thing. It was as if she had been choosing, choosing not to take everything Agatha thought she was. Rio could have ended it, could have kept everything fixed, contained, and yet, she chose to let it slip through her fingers. That thought lingered like poison in Agatha’s veins.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was speaking of choices, of desires, of things Death had no right to entertain, let alone partake in. And worse, she was voicing them aloud, laying them out between them like an offering, like a confession. Agatha doubted her wife had ever allowed herself this much before, had ever dared to put words to the longing she had no right to feel. It was indulgence in its purest form, and Rio had chosen to speak it anyway. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know whether to be furious or terrified by it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, but the only word she could manage was a quiet, “Why?” It was all she had the strength to ask, the only thing that made sense in the moment.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked down between them, a sad smile tugging at her lips as she let out a huff of laughter, shaking her head slightly. When she met Agatha’s gaze again, her eyes were watery. Her wife’s fingers traced over her pulse once more before her other hand came to rest against Agatha’s cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Rio whispered, “Because I don’t want to exist in a world where Agatha Harkness does not. I do not wish to be the keeper of a balance that does not include you. What is order without chaos? What is Death without you to defy it?"</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated her for saying it because there was no defense against this. Against Rio standing here, saying these things in a voice that trembled.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could argue against love. She could mock it, twist it into something ugly and small, diminish it into something laughable and weak. But it wouldn’t change anything. It wouldn’t take the words back. They were already inside of Agatha, sinking deep, taking root in the places they absolutely did not belong.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart twisted in a way that made her sick. This wasn’t the woman she had known. The woman who had held to her duty with such an iron grip, refusing to let go of the natural order, refusing to let herself hope for anything else. She had always known Rio as something untouchable, unreachable, far beyond her grasp. But this… this was different. It was almost like Rio had unlocked a door inside herself that Agatha had never known existed.</p><p> </p><p>This wasn’t just indulgence. It wasn’t some sudden confession made in weakness, some foolish, desperate reach for what had already been lost. </p><p> </p><p>This had always been there, buried beneath centuries of silence, beneath fights and betrayals, beneath the masks they both wore so well. And now Rio was speaking it aloud, letting the dam break, letting the truth spill out after centuries of pretending it wasn’t there. It had been real. It had been intentional. A choice made over and over again, not in brief moments, but in the deliberate defiance of everything Death was meant to be.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice cut through Agatha’s thoughts, "Why do you think you’re still here?" A whisper that felt like the final blow, like her wife had been holding onto this one last piece just to see if Agatha could withstand it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands were trembling, her fingers digging into Rio’s shoulders, nails biting into fabric, she felt like letting go would mean losing something vital. </p><p> </p><p>Of course. Of course there was more.</p><p> </p><p>"Yes. You took a calculated risk, you wanted a way out… I just made sure it was within reach... if you chose to take it."</p><p> </p><p>The words hit like a slap to the face. Agatha had believed it had been herself. That she alone had stolen those last moments. That she had clawed her way past Death’s reach, found a loophole, and slipped through it by sheer defiance. She had thought she had won. That she had outplayed Death.</p><p> </p><p>But Death had been helping her cheat.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t fair. It wasn’t fair that Rio got to say all of this now, after everything. It wasn’t fair that she was looking at her like this, touching her like this. It wasn’t fair that Agatha, for all her wit, for all her cunning, for all the ways she had thought she had been able to outmaneuver Death, could do nothing in the face of Rio’s honesty.</p><p> </p><p>"Why are you telling me this?" Agatha whispered. She didn’t fight how desperate it sounded. Because, honestly, she was desperate.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted answers. She needed them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had told her things, had done things she was never meant to do. And Agatha, against all logic, against everything she knew, felt hope like a cruel whisper in the back of her mind, daring her to believe it.</p><p> </p><p>That maybe they could have something more than this endless cycle of loss and duty. But Agatha already knew the cost, knew what it would take. And neither of them wanted that… <em> Right? </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio was telling her the truth. She was giving her honesty in a way she never had before. But more than that, she was giving her hope, and that was the cruelest thing of all. Because Agatha knew better than to believe in something she could never have, but Rio was making her want to anyway.</p><p> </p><p>And hope, when you already knew the price, was a fucking knife to the gut.</p><p> </p><p>“Because I told you that I would do anything for you,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had. That Spring.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I’d do anything for you,” she whispered, the words so quiet. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Tell me you’d walk away from it, if I asked you to.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Now that pissed Agatha off.</p><p> </p><p>Because it wasn’t real. None of it was.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had placed the choice in her hands, as if it meant anything. As if Agatha could be the one to speak the words that would damn them both. As if Rio wasn’t already certain of the answer.</p><p> </p><p>All she had to do was say it, and Rio would do it. No hesitation, no argument. But only because she knew Agatha never would.</p><p> </p><p>Her wife had told her this knowing exactly what it meant. Knowing the cost. If they did this, if they took what Rio was offering, it wouldn’t be them who paid for it. It would be Sage. Their daughter would be the one shackled to the very thing they had spent centuries fighting.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio had given Agatha the illusion of choice, not because her wife couldn’t decide, but because Rio refused to.</p><p> </p><p>This hope was a lie. All of it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha Harkness had never been a stranger to being the villain. She had worn the role like a second skin, had been feared, hated, cursed by those who didn’t understand her. She had made impossible choices, burned bridges without hesitation, left ruin in her wake when she had to. She had taken power when it was within reach and stolen it when it wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been selfish before.</p><p> </p><p>She could be selfish now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had just told her exactly what it would take to end this. And if Agatha truly wanted to, if she could stomach the cost, all she had to do was speak the words.</p><p> </p><p>The fury rising in her chest pushed the words from her lips as she shoved Rio away from her. “And if I asked you to give it up? Then what? You’d hate me forever?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew what she said, she wanted the words to bite. She wanted them to sink their teeth into Rio and not let go.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t enough. It never was. Rio barely stumbled, barely moved, she had expected it. It was like she had been waiting for Agatha to lash out. But Agatha didn’t care.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t just about them anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Where did this leave Sage? Their daughter, who had spent who knows how long trying to give them a way out. Sage, who had orchestrated all of this, who had lied, manipulated, dragged them back together under false pretenses- not for herself, but for them. She had made them face each other, made them remember, made them want something different.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had still told her no.</p><p> </p><p>It was infuriating. It was cruel. Because if Rio had already decided, then what the hell was this? What was the point of this entire conversation? Why tell Agatha she had a say in any of this when she had never given Sage one?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had spent centuries running from Death, but Sage had never run. She had reached for Rio, pulled, tried to hold her together, tried to save her in a way that Agatha never had. And Rio had still told her no.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha got to pretend she had a choice.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re lying,” Agatha said through gritted teeth. Her nails bit into her palms.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, “I’d give It up,” the words almost a whisper. “If you asked me to, I’d do it. And I wouldn’t hate you for it.” She swallowed, exhaled, then added, “But I know you won’t.”</p><p> </p><p>The certainty in her voice was fucking insufferable.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. Her pulse pounded in her ears. It wasn’t a challenge. It wasn’t a plea. It was truth, spoken so plainly it left no room for argument.</p><p> </p><p>And that was what made Agatha’s stomach twist, what made her want to scream.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio was right.</p><p> </p><p>"I'm sorry," Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move. She wasn’t sure she could.</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed, her gaze flickering downward before she forced herself to look at Agatha again. "I wasn’t trying to hurt you," she admitted. "I just... I don’t know what I was trying to do."</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened in a way she hated. She knew Rio wasn’t lying. Rio wasn’t trying to manipulate her.</p><p> </p><p>Her wife just looked lost. Rio was lost.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, rubbing a hand over her face before letting it drop. “I know,” she murmured, and it surprised her how much she meant it.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to think about it anymore- not the choice Rio had never really given her, not the past, not the future. Right now, all she wanted was to exist in what remained, in whatever time they still had together.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled deeply, before speaking again. She wasn’t trying to argue or fight. She was just… tired. And she figured whatever Rio was dealing with probably explained why her wife had been so insistent on keeping Sage close in the garden. So Agatha decided she’d say something- let Rio know before Sage sniffed it out on her own.</p><p> </p><p>Anything to pull this conversation away from herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Our daughter…” Agatha started, watching Rio carefully, “has picked up on the fact that you’ve been acting strange.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s brows furrowed, confusion flickering across her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and clarified, “Calling her to the garden every morning?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted slightly, pressing her lips together, but still didn’t speak.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed. She wasn’t here to interrogate her, and she wasn’t looking for another confession. Whatever was going on in Rio’s head, whatever reason she had for pulling Sage to the garden every morning, Agatha wasn’t sure she wanted to know. Not now. Maybe not ever.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe you think she hasn’t questioned it, but she has,” Agatha continued, keeping her voice even. “She’s trying to piece it together, but eventually, she’s going to stop thinking and start asking. And knowing her, that won’t be a quiet conversation.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled, gaze flickering downward for a moment, but Agatha could tell her wife was listening.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage isn’t going to let this go,” Agatha pressed. “If you don’t intend to do anything about it, then I suggest you stop now before she gets the wrong idea.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was very much speaking for herself too.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly, studying Rio’s face before adding, “Because you’re going to give her hope. And we both know that’s not fair.”</p><p> </p><p>It was advice because whether Rio realized it or not, Sage was watching. And when their daughter finally decided she wanted answers, she wasn’t going to be gentle about getting them.</p><p> </p><p>And when Rio looked back up at her, Agatha watched as the mask slipped back on effortlessly- the same one Rio had always worn. The one that pissed Agatha off to no end. It was smooth, practiced, impenetrable, the kind of armor that came from an eternity of knowing how to hide and pull herself together even when she was breaking apart.</p><p> </p><p>Rio only held Agatha's gaze, her thoughts locked behind that familiar wall of logic and restraint.</p><p> </p><p>Then, with a small nod, Rio turned and walked out of the study, leaving Agatha alone with everything that had just been said.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>They hadn’t talked about it again.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, they both acted as if the conversation had never happened at all. There were no lingering glances, no unfinished sentences waiting to be spoken, no tension pressing at their interactions. It wasn’t forced, not really. It was just… understood.</p><p> </p><p>Everything went back to normal. Life carried on.</p><p> </p><p>Rio still called Sage to the garden each morning. Agatha still pretended not to notice. Sage hadn’t brought it up again, though Agatha could see the wheels turning in their daughter’s head, the way she lingered a little too long sometimes, like she was waiting for someone to slip. But neither of them did.</p><p> </p><p>There were mornings with coffee, conversations that held no weight, Rio’s familiar presence at her side. And though there was still something unspoken beneath it all, neither of them reached for it. They didn’t want to.</p><p> </p><p>Because this -this ease, this understanding, this space where they could simply exist together- was enough. Maybe not forever. Maybe not even for long.</p><p> </p><p>But for now, it was.</p><p> </p><p>And right now, Agatha couldn’t think of anything except the way Rio’s tongue was in her mouth, stealing the breath from her lungs.</p><p> </p><p>It had started simply enough- Rio’s hand resting on her thigh, light and absentminded. Innocent. Or at least, it had seemed that way at first. But then her fingers had started tracing slow, infuriating patterns against her skin, creeping higher with each pass. Agatha had let it happen, let Rio push the boundaries, let herself enjoy the anticipation curling low in her stomach. Her breath had turned uneven, betraying her far too quickly.</p><p> </p><p>She turned her head, one brow arched in question, but Rio was already watching her, eyes dark, pupils blown, lips parted like she had been waiting for Agatha to finally look at her.</p><p> </p><p>And those lips…</p><p> </p><p>Well, they had been begging to be kissed.</p><p> </p><p>The next thing she knew, they were tangled together on the couch, making out like a couple of horny teenagers, all frantic hands and desperate mouths. It was rushed and messy, and they were trying to be quiet but failing… Spectacularly, at that.</p><p> </p><p>And, shockingly, it was Rio’s fault.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever door Agatha had unlocked that Spring day hadn’t just opened- it had flown off its fucking hinges. Death had once been a quiet lover, always swallowing her sounds, keeping her pleasure locked behind clenched teeth and controlled breaths. Only ever giving Agatha small glimpses at the sounds Rio was capable of making.</p><p> </p><p>But not anymore.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was loud.</p><p> </p><p>She gasped against Agatha’s lips, moaned when their bodies shifted, let out these broken, desperate sounds that she wasn’t even trying to contain. She whined when Agatha pulled away, whimpered when Agatha kissed her again, sighing like she had spent lifetimes holding back, only to finally let go, and God, was her wife making up for lost time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha, for one, sure as fuck was not complaining.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back just enough to catch her breath, lips tingling, pulse pounding in her ears. “You suck at being quiet,” she muttered, voice slightly ragged.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, utterly unapologetic, let out a breathless laugh. “I wasn’t trying to be quiet.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but any exasperation she might have felt was completely undercut by the way Rio was already chasing after her mouth again, hands still gripping at her like she had no plans to let go anytime soon.</p><p> </p><p>“You used to be,” Agatha pointed out, arching a brow.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hummed, pressing an open mouthed kiss to her throat. “I used to be a lot of things.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let out a breath, gripping Rio’s chin and tilting her head back. “Oh? And what exactly are you now?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned, eyes dark with want. “Down bad for my very hot wife.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even have time to draw breath for a response before a blood curdling scream tore through the house, it echoed down from their daughter’s bedroom upstairs.</p><p> </p><p>Instinct took over. Whatever tension had been in the room vanished in an instant as both of them scrambled into motion. Agatha nearly tripped over the edge of the couch in her haste, Rio vaulting over it with the kind of reckless urgency that left no room for grace. They collided with furniture, knocked over a lamp- neither stopping to see where it landed.</p><p> </p><p>By the time they reached the stairs, they were a tangle of limbs, jostling and pushing past each other in their desperate climb. Rio was faster. She always was. She reached Sage’s door first and didn’t hesitate, slamming through it with enough force to send it flying open, nearly off its hinges. Agatha was right behind her but didn’t have time to stop, crashing straight into Rio’s back with a startled grunt.</p><p> </p><p>None of it was graceful. It was messy, frantic, driven by nothing but sheer, unfiltered panic. And beyond the wreckage of their entrance, Sage’s scream still lingered in the air.</p><p> </p><p>Then- </p><p> </p><p>“YOU WHORE!”</p><p> </p><p>The betrayal in Sage’s voice was staggering, a bolt of lighting struck, shaking the entire house.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha barely had time to process the words before her eyes found Sage, kneeling in front of Brucie’s enclosure. Her hands were braced against the glass, fingers digging in like she needed something to hold on to. Her shoulders shook, her breath came in gasps, but she didn’t move. Didn’t turn. Didn’t acknowledge them.</p><p> </p><p>There was no blood. No intruder. No sign of danger. Nothing that warranted a scream like that.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, still braced, ready to fight something, was the first to break the silence. She exhaled, the adrenaline crashing just as fast as it had spiked. Then, voice hesitant, like she wasn’t sure she wanted the answer, she asked, “Sage… why are you calling the snake a whore?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s head snapped toward them so fast it was a miracle she didn’t hurt herself. Her eyes burned with an unadulterated fury, her chest still heaving as she fought to catch her breath.</p><p> </p><p>“Take a look for yourselves!” she snarled, pushing herself up from the floor in one violent motion.</p><p> </p><p>Before either of them could react, she turned back to Brucie’s enclosure, hands clenched into trembling fists at her sides. “I can’t even look at you!” she yelled.</p><p> </p><p>And then, as if the very act of acknowledging Brucie was too much to bear, she spun on her heel and threw herself face first against the nearest wall. Arms splayed wide, forehead pressed dramatically against the wall.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio just stared at their daughter, utterly bewildered.</p><p> </p><p>The room was thick with silence, broken only by Sage’s ragged breathing as she remained plastered against the wall, arms stretched out like she was waiting to be crucified.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heart was still racing from the panic that had sent them barreling up the stairs, but now, faced with this, she could feel the first tendrils of a headache creeping in. She flicked a glance at Rio, expecting (hoping) for some kind of reaction, but Rio looked just as lost, her eyes darting between Sage and Brucie’s enclosure as if staring hard enough would make things make sense.</p><p> </p><p>Seconds stretched. No one moved. No one spoke.</p><p> </p><p>"Would you like to go first?" Agatha asked, jutting her chin toward the snake’s enclosure.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still staring at it, eyes wide, looking very much like she wanted to be anywhere else.</p><p> </p><p>“Nope. I’m good.” She tore her gaze away just long enough to glance at Agatha. “Ladies first.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed, rolling her eyes. “Coward,” she mumbled, but even so, she hesitated before moving.</p><p> </p><p>Sage still hadn’t turned around, still hadn’t so much as twitched, which only made Agatha warier.</p><p> </p><p>With deliberate slowness, she inched her way toward Brucie’s enclosure. The closer she got, the more she could feel Rio at her back, hovering. She didn’t even have to turn around to confirm it- Rio’s fingers had already latched onto the back of her shirt, gripping it like a lifeline as she followed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed, “Really?”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m providing emotional support,” Rio whispered, which was a bold way to describe hiding behind her wife.</p><p> </p><p>Ignoring her, Agatha took another cautious step forward, steeling herself for whatever horror Sage had witnessed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took a steadying breath and peered into the enclosure.</p><p> </p><p>The moment she did, Sage whipped herself around, arms crossed, a fist pressed against her mouth, worry written all over her face. Agatha could feel Rio peeking over her shoulder, practically breathing down her neck.</p><p> </p><p>And there it was.</p><p> </p><p>Brucie, coiled tight, her neon green scales gleaming under the soft enclosure light- wrapped protectively around eggs.</p><p> </p><p>Lots of fucking eggs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. Her mouth opened, closed, then finally managed to breathe out, "Oh my god."</p><p> </p><p>“NO!” Rio yelled.</p><p> </p><p>Sage snapped her head between them, desperate, waiting for them to provide some grand wisdom beyond the sheer shock that was currently seeping out of both of them.</p><p> </p><p>Brucie remained coiled around her absurd, absolutely unholy amount of eggs, acting like nothing at all was amiss.</p><p> </p><p>“How many are there?” Agatha asked, eyes never leaving Sage’s familiar.</p><p> </p><p>“Thirty,” Sage deadpanned beside her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even get the chance to react before Rio gasped behind them, voice trembling with horror. “Thirty more Brucies?” her wife whispered, like the words alone might kill her. She staggered back a step, then another, visibly paling. “I think I’m gonna be sick.”</p><p> </p><p>Then there was a thud.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped around just in time to see Rio sprawled out on the floor, completely unconscious.</p><p> </p><p>She stared. For a long time.</p><p> </p><p>Death herself, literal Death, had just fainted at the idea of too many snakes.</p><p> </p><p>Then slowly Agatha turned her head back to Sage, who (despite the absurdity of what had just happened) looked far more concerned about her own predicament.</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, I’m too young to be a grandmother, right?” Sage asked, wide eyed, wanting Agatha to offer her some kind of comfort.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned fully, irritation surely written all over her face. Between Rio’s absolute disgrace of a reaction and Sage’s impending existential crisis, she was fast approaching the limits of what she was willing to deal with today.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re nearly three hundred years old,” Agatha shot back.</p><p> </p><p>Sage visibly recoiled, "Oh my god!”  Her hands flying to the sides of her head in pure horror. “And you’re too old to be a great grandmother!” She shouted the last part, pointing at Agatha like she had just discovered a crime against nature.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gasped, hand flying to her chest. “Pardon?” She barely had time to process her own offense before Sage’s eyes rolled back, her body tilting- </p><p> </p><p>“Oh, for the love of- ” Agatha lunged forward, but Sage collapsed like a sack of bricks, slamming into the floor with a dramatic thud.</p><p> </p><p>For several long seconds, Agatha just stood there, staring at her two unconscious idiots on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Then, very slowly, she inhaled, held it, and exhaled.</p><p> </p><p>"Not the first time I’ve said it and surely not the last… I should’ve stayed fucking dead," Agatha mumbled.</p><p>Agatha whipped back to Brucie, bent down, and pointed. “And Sage is right. You are a whore.”</p><p> </p><p>Then she stepped over Rio’s unconscious body, not sparing her so much as a glance, and marched straight out of the bedroom. She slammed the door behind her and for good measure, she bellowed down the hall-</p><p> </p><p>“Fucking morons!”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t so sure she hated summer anymore.</p><p> </p><p>It still filled every inch of the world, still wrapped itself around everything in its path, but maybe it wasn’t stifling. Maybe it was simply constant, refusing to slip away unnoticed. The heat still settled on her skin, still lingered longer than it should, but she no longer felt the need to fight it.</p><p> </p><p>The air was still thick, but it carried something more than just the weight of the season. The brightness still left no place to hide, but there was no urge to pull away from it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha realized maybe it had never been trying to take anything from her at all. Maybe it had only ever been trying to hold on a little longer, knowing it would have to leave when its time was up, knowing it could never stay, but still lingering, burning itself into the world so it wouldn’t be forgotten.</p>

<p>Fall:</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated fall.</p><p> </p><p>It was a season of retreat. The world pulled back, hollowed itself out, and made everything smaller. The days shrank, the light faded earlier, and the air turned brittle. It was a season of endings, of quiet resignations, of knowing what was coming and having no power to stop it.</p><p> </p><p>People spoke of change as though it was something beautiful, but Agatha had never found much comfort in the slow unraveling of things. Fall was not the fire of summer or the bloom of spring. It did not take boldly or give recklessly. It simply withered. It let go, piece by piece, leaving nothing behind but bare branches and cold wind.</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing dramatic about fall. No fight, no lingering presence, no last desperate attempt to hold on. It was a season that knew how to leave.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio had gotten an early start in the garden that morning, already hard at work by the time Agatha stepped outside with her coffee. She took to her usual spot on the patio, stretching out in the cool morning air, the warmth of her mug pressing against her palms. Rio hadn’t looked up, too focused on whatever task had her attention.</p><p> </p><p>The morning carried that sharp bite of fall, crisp enough to make her consider grabbing a blanket but not quite enough to push her inside. It was the kind of quiet Agatha enjoyed. It wasn’t heavy or stifling, just a pause before the day really began. She sipped her coffee, glancing toward the house. It wouldn’t be long before Sage appeared, half dressed and mid thought, ready to disrupt the morning with whatever had taken root in her mind overnight.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smirked. The peace wouldn’t last, but she didn’t mind.</p><p> </p><p>As if summoned by the thought alone, the back door swung open with the kind of force only Sage could manage.  Agatha looked up, expecting her usual whirlwind entrance, but instead, Sage stumbled out looking like she had barely survived the night.</p><p> </p><p>Her coveralls were on in the loosest sense of the word. One strap hung unbuckled, the fabric bunched awkwardly over a black hoodie that looked like it had been slept in. Her hair was pulled into what might've once been a ponytail, but at some point had clearly lost its structural integrity. One pant leg was shoved into her sock while the other dragged, and she carried her boots in one hand like just the thought of putting them on was simply too much.</p><p> </p><p>Mumbling to herself, she stomped across the patio and threw herself into a chair and chunked her boots at the ground with the kind of theatrical misery that would’ve made a poet proud.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sipped her coffee, unimpressed, watching as Sage groaned, shifted, flailed an arm over her face, groaned again, and then sighed so loudly it could have been mistaken for a death rattle.</p><p> </p><p>“Rough morning?” Agatha finally asked, not out of concern, but because her daughter’s performance demanded acknowledgment.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shot Agatha a glare before flopping back into the chair with another groan. She wiggled around trying to physically escape the exhaustion clinging to her, kicked one leg out, then suddenly shot up again, gripping the armrests with both hands.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m tired,” she groaned, dragging the last word out so long it might never end. She shook the chair in frustration, then let out another dramatic sigh and collapsed forward, burying her face in her arms on the table.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t blink. “You’re very brave,” she said dryly.</p><p> </p><p>From the depths of her folded arms, Sage let out another long, drawn out groan, muffled but still dripping with misery.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t get it,” she mumbled. “I’m, like, universally tired. Cosmic level exhaustion. My bones are asleep. My soul is limping.” She pushed herself up and clambered onto the table. She stretched out across it, sprawled flat like a Victorian woman on her deathbed, limbs hanging dramatically over the sides.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took another sip of coffee, “Sounds serious. Maybe you should lie down,” she said, nodding toward the table Sage was already sprawled across.</p><p> </p><p>Sage lifted her head just enough to squint at her, “I am lying down.” She groaned again, flopping one arm out like she was reaching for salvation. “Tell Mom I fought courageously,” she murmured, her voice growing weaker. “And that I-” She let out a dramatic sigh and went limp, playing dead.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her, then reached out and flicked her forehead.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shot up with a yelp, nearly rolling off the table. “Ow! What the hell is wrong with you?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha only shrugged, “You can go back to bed, you know.”</p><p> </p><p>“YoU cAn Go BaCk To BeD, YoU kNoW,” Sage mimicked in a mocking, nasally voice</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cracked a smile at the ridiculousness of it.</p><p> </p><p>Still sprawled across the table, Sage suddenly clambered up onto her knees, her movements clumsy. “You don’t think I’ve tried that?” she hissed, eyes wild with the desperation of a woman pushed to her limits.</p><p> </p><p>Before Agatha could react, Sage lunged forward, grabbing fistfuls of her shirt and yanking her closer.</p><p> </p><p>“She is killing me!” Sage hissed, jerking her head toward the garden, where Rio was hunched over, humming to herself as she plucked dead leaves off a plant. “Calling me out here every morning at the ass crack of dawn! And I try- believe me, I try- to ignore it, to fight it, to stay in bed like a normal person, but it doesn’t stop!” She gave Agatha’s shirt another desperate shake. “So spill! Tell me what you know! Talk, woman!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shoved Sage off with a little more force than necessary, making her daughter topple onto her back with another yelp. “I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Agatha said sharply.</p><p> </p><p>Sage pushed herself up on her elbows, squinting at Agatha, her tongue poking into her cheek as she studied her. Agatha rolled her eyes and looked away, but she could absolutely hear the gears turning in her daughter’s head.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, that was defensive,” Sage said, drawing out the words with a slow grin creeping onto her face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stiffened just slightly, and when she looked back, she was met with that spark of excitement in her daughter’s eyes. The one that meant she had her teeth in something now and wasn’t about to let go.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Fuck. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>With absolutely zero grace and her beady green eyes locked onto Agatha, Sage slid off the table and into her chair. She leaned forward, elbows on the table, fingers laced together. “Ohhh,” she drawled, eyes practically glittering. “You do know something.”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know shit,” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Sage jerked back slightly- not in shock, but in pure, unfiltered delight. The excitement in her eyes turned sharp, wild, her tongue pressing into her cheek holding back a grin.</p><p> </p><p>It was exactly something Rio would do. And that only pissed Agatha off more.</p><p> </p><p>She had told Rio to cut it out. If she didn’t want Sage asking questions no one could answer -or ones Rio refused to- then she needed to stop handing their daughter the ammunition. But Rio never listened, and Agatha let it slide for as long as she could, convincing herself it wasn’t her problem to solve.</p><p> </p><p>Now, Sage was picking at it, poking holes in something Agatha didn’t have answers for, something she didn’t even want to think about. It was frustrating.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had told her, without hesitation, that she would do anything for her. And Agatha, because she couldn’t help herself because some part of her wanted to test the truth of it, had pushed. And Rio had answered.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t a fantasy or some impossible dream. It could be real if she asked. And that was the cruelest part. It wasn’t impossible. It was right there, waiting, hers for the taking.</p><p> </p><p>But she wouldn’t. She couldn’t.</p><p> </p><p>And now Agatha had to live with that knowledge, had to carry it strapped to her chest, had to pretend it wasn’t exactly what she wanted. She had to act like the thought of it didn’t gnaw at her in the quiet moments, as if it didn’t linger in between her and Rio, as if it didn’t make her ache for something she could never have.</p><p> </p><p>An afterlife with her wife. With their son. With their daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha needed to accept that it would never happen, she had to make peace with the fact that this was the life they had. But some days, it was impossible to ignore. Some days, it pressed down on her so hard she felt like she might suffocate under it.</p><p> </p><p>And on those days, she wanted desperately, violently, to talk about it. To say it out loud. To ask someone if there was a way. And because she was Agatha, because her mind never let things rest, she had even considered bringing it up to Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe they could figure it out. Maybe there was some loophole, some missing piece they weren’t seeing. Maybe- </p><p> </p><p>
<em> It’s so fucking stupid. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It made her reckless. It made her desperate. It made her feel like she was losing her grip on reality, spiraling over a what if that could never be. And yet, she couldn’t let it go. No matter how much she tried, no matter how much she wanted to, it was always there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, forcing herself back into the moment, back to the patio, back to the girl sitting across from her who had no idea just how close Agatha was to cracking, to throwing the whole damn thing at her daughter’s feet in a desperate attempt that saying it out loud might make it stop living in her head.</p><p> </p><p>"Would you stop looking at me? It's pissing me off," Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t even blink. If anything, she looked more interested, a bloodhound catching the scent of something worth chasing. Her fingers drummed against the table, her gaze narrowing in a way that made Agatha’s skin itch.</p><p> </p><p>Sage leaned back in her chair, arms crossing over her chest, tongue pressing into her cheek again as she flicked a glance toward the garden. She squinted at Rio, eyes narrowing.</p><p> </p><p>Then, with an exaggerated sigh, she looked back at Agatha. “You know what? Why don’t I just go ask her myself? Get my answer straight from the source, huh?” Sage pushed up from her chair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t think. Her body moved before her mind caught up, her hand shooting out to grip Sage’s wrist, fingers tightening instinctively. “Don’t.” The panic in her own voice was obvious.</p><p> </p><p>Sage stilled. Her gaze dropped to Agatha’s hand, then back to her face, eyebrows raising.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could feel the way Sage was already turning it over in her head, analyzing, digging, getting ready to pounce. Irritation burned hot in her chest, rising fast, because it was too early for this. Too early for Sage’s mind games, too early for Rio’s mess, too early for the thoughts she had been forcing herself not to think about for months. Agatha’s grip tightened, her teeth clenched, and she forced the words out, “Sit. Down. Now.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t hesitate. She dropped right back into her chair, grin stretching wide across her face. “Touched a nerve, did I?” she mused, voice syrupy sweet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let go of her wrist and picked up her coffee instead, taking a sip, hoping it might drown out the overwhelming urge to strangle her own child.</p><p> </p><p>She set her coffee down, very slowly, careful not to slam it onto the table and risk shattering it. She closed her eyes, inhaled deeply, and tried <em>(tried)</em> to gather the last scraps of her patience. Then she looked at Sage.</p><p> </p><p>And immediately closed her eyes again.</p><p> </p><p>The urge to strangle her had not passed. If anything, it had gotten worse.</p><p> </p><p>She took another breath, peeked one eye open, and found Sage sitting perfectly still, hands folded, expression neutral. Too neutral.</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter’s face had settled into something almost saintly, like she had reached an enlightened state of patience. Which only meant one thing- she knew she was being obnoxious, knew she had pushed too far, and was now waiting. Not out of remorse, but because she understood, in her own infuriating way, that Agatha needed a moment to process the absolute audacity of her existence.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t know why she’s been calling you out to the garden. I’m being honest about that.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage must’ve heard the truth in Agatha’s voice, because her face softened right away. Her shoulders eased, and her gaze flicked to Rio for a moment before settling on Agatha again.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Sage said quietly. “I just… I feel like I’m missing something. Like you both know something I don’t, and it’s driving me crazy. My mind won’t let it go and I’m just… I’m sorry. We don’t have to talk about it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted to bang her head against the table. She understood Sage, maybe more than she wanted to. The girl was hers and Rio’s, through and through. Both of them were the kind of people who could feel when something was being kept from them, and neither ever let it go. It wasn’t about trust- it was instinct. A refusal to sit still when answers were missing.</p><p> </p><p>So yeah, Sage was prying. She was playing games, pushing buttons to get a reaction. But Agatha couldn’t entirely blame her. That itch for the truth ran deep. And unfortunately, it was inherited.</p><p> </p><p>That honestly made it worse because now it wasn’t just Agatha pacing in circles. Sage was too. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t even have any real answers. All she knew was that Rio had been off. Her wife had been acting weird in a way that wasn’t just mood or timing, but like something had broken open in her. She’d said things Agatha never thought she’d hear. Admitted things Agatha thought were impossible. The kind of impossible that sat right next to hell freezing over.</p><p> </p><p>It was eating at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>Not knowing what it meant. Not knowing what to do with it. Like a piece of glass buried deep beneath her skin, impossible to ignore, and she couldn’t tell if pulling it out would bring relief or leave everyone bleeding.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha already felt like she was bleeding herself dry. And Sage seemed like she wasn’t far behind.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t about to spell out everything Rio had said or done, but she could nudge Sage’s suspicions in the right direction. “You said it yourself. She’s been acting strange.” She shrugged, trying to sound casual, though it didn’t quite land.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw the tension behind Sage’s eyes, the way she was holding her tongue, clearly resisting the urge to press until the full truth was dragged out of her mother.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” Sage whispered.</p><p> </p><p>The word sat wrong with Agatha. Too quiet. Too polite.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been counting on the exact opposite of that. She had counted on Sage being her usual insufferably curious self- poking hard enough, loud enough, to drag the truth out without Agatha having to actually offer it up. But now? Now she was quiet? Respectful?</p><p> </p><p>A stranger had shown up in her daughter’s place, and frankly, Agatha fucking hated it.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re quiet all of a sudden,” Agatha said, irritation slipping into her voice. “No theories? No wild guesses?”</p><p> </p><p>“Well, I mean, you’re being pretty fucking vague about everything. So no.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed and rubbed at her temples. She never should’ve opened her mouth. There was no way to explain it without everything spilling out at once. All of it. And she couldn’t let that happen. Not with Sage. Maybe she should have just let her daughter take the lead like she tried to earlier. Let her confront Rio. Let her drag it out of her. Because Agatha had nothing. No angle. No strategy. Just the same silence she kept falling into.</p><p> </p><p>She dropped her hands and looked over.</p><p> </p><p>“You know what? Maybe you should bring it up to her,” Agatha said, shifting tactics like it had been her idea all along. “See what’s actually going on in her head. You’re good at prying things out of people who don’t want to talk.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, so now you want me to go poke that emotionally constipated bear? When five minutes ago you told me not to say a word. That’s weird.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. “You know damn well she’s the least emotionally constipated of the three of us.”</p><p> </p><p>“You’re absolutely right,” Sage said. “Except when it comes to one very specific subject.” Her eyebrows lifted. She was watching, wondering if she had gotten too close to something her mother didn’t want sticky fingers to touch.</p><p> </p><p>“Watch it.”</p><p> </p><p>A warning. Almost a threat. Agatha’s patience was fraying, and Sage didn’t know what she was near. But she was starting to reach. And Agatha, like any mother with a lighter in one hand and sticky fingers in the room, wasn’t about to let her any closer.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t flinch. “I mean,” she said. “It's just funny. I breathe wrong in Mom’s direction and you’re throwing yourself in front of a train. Now you want me to play messenger?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s tone turned cold, “I said maybe.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right. Maybe. The universal sign for ‘I don’t want to deal with this, so I’m shoving it off on you. Which, by the way, I am not touching <em> that </em>with a- ” she paused, bringing a thoughtful hand to her chin, eyes flicking upward like she needed to think about it. “Let’s say, thirty-foot fucking pole. Tried that once. We all saw how it turned out. Everyone. Miserable.”’</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not shoving anything,” Agatha said. “I’m giving you an option. Take it or don’t, but stop acting like you’re being thrown to the wolves. She’s your mother.”</p><p> </p><p>“So are you,” Sage shot back.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stared at her daughter like she hadn’t just been struck with a blade between her ribs. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha was frustrated. Frustrated at Rio- for everything she’d said, and everything she refused to say. But the truth was, Agatha had been doing the same exact thing. Different angle. Same result. Keeping Sage at arm’s length. And for the most part, Sage took it. She asked once, maybe twice, then let it go. And now here they were, months later, both of them tired of dancing around the truth, but neither one willing to face the source. Too tired to keep circling it. Too scared to name it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled and pinched the bridge of her nose. “I don’t know what I’m doing, Sage. I don’t know what she’s doing. I’m not sitting on some grand revelation. I’m just as in the dark as you are.”</p><p> </p><p>It was true- for the most part. Agatha didn’t know why Rio had suddenly started to hesitate, why she’d become vocal about things she’d never acknowledged before.  Of course, Agatha would never ask. She wouldn’t press. But that didn’t explain why Rio was starting to feel like someone trying to remember who she was supposed to be.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s going on?”</p><p> </p><p>Both Agatha and Sage snapped their heads toward the sound of Rio’s voice. Stillness followed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the sweep of her wife’s gaze, tracking between them- measuring, registering, reading far too much. Her pulse thrummed in her limbs, roared in her ears, pressing up her throat like it wanted out.</p><p> </p><p>“Noth-” The word crumbled before it could leave Agatha’s mouth. She cleared her throat, forced a breath, and shaped her lips into something that resembled a smile. “Nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes stayed on her. Dark, questioning. Not quite accusatory, not yet, but close enough to sting.</p><p> </p><p>A pause. Then, softly, “How’s your familiar holding up, Petal?”</p><p> </p><p>“Only a few more left to hatch,” Sage answered, cautious, eyes flicking between them. “I released most of them into the realm yesterday.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nice.” But Rio didn’t look at her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t looked away from Agatha at all.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her wife’s gaze and refused to look away. She wasn’t afraid of Rio- not now, not ever. That wasn’t what this was. Rio wasn’t trying to be intimidating, but there was something distant behind her eyes, something locked away. Like Rio was standing right in front of her but she had already left the room.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had the unsettling feeling she wasn’t just staring at her wife anymore. She was looking at the part of Rio that still answered to Death, still belonged to It and hadn’t let go. </p><p> </p><p>Then came the thought, clear enough to stick. A theory. One Agatha didn’t entirely trust, but couldn’t ignore either. If she was wrong, fine. No harm in trying.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t look away from Rio when she said, “Sage, do me a favor and grab me a book from the study.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a pause next to her, Agatha knew it came with narrowed eyes and a furrowed brow without even having to look. “What book?” Sage asked, clearly thrown off.</p><p> </p><p>“Any book,” Agatha said flatly. “I don’t give a fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t argue. She gave them both one last glance and turned to leave, her footsteps fading behind them as she disappeared into the house.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed quiet, eyes still locked on Rio.</p><p> </p><p>At first, nothing obvious changed. Rio didn’t speak, didn’t sigh, didn’t move a muscle. But after a breath or two, Agatha saw the smallest shift in her stance.</p><p> </p><p>It was barely anything, but it was there. A loosening in her wife’s shoulders. A softening around her brown eyes. The stiffness that Rio had begun to  carry when Sage was nearby, the alertness in her body, eased in their daughter’s absence. Her hands, always still and careful when Sage was close, now hung more loosely at her sides. She didn’t relax, exactly. But Rio stopped holding herself in place.</p><p> </p><p><em> Bingo </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled Sage to the garden every morning because she couldn’t afford to forget what was at stake. A line Rio wouldn’t cross. She wasn’t holding on to Death because she wanted to. She was doing it because she refused to pass the burden onto their daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio needed the reminder. Her wife needed the consequence in full view. That way, there was no room for indulgence. No softness. No future she could imagine for herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her eyes trace over her wife. Rio turned her head fast, like the attention stung. Like being seen hurt more than being ignored.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look away. She exhaled, “Huh.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio went still. </p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Her wife breathed out her name like a plea.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Don’t look too closely. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t say it, but Agatha felt it in the way her wife drew inward like she was reaching for the mask that used to settle effortlessly over her face. Only now it wouldn’t fit.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Don’t look too closely. I’ll leave It behind before you even speak a word. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned away completely, shoulders trembling as she drew in a shuddering breath. From where Agatha sat, the sight of Rio’s hand drifting aimlessly through the air while the other clung desperately to her waist. “I- I think I should get back to work,” Rio said with a strained laugh, brittle and hollow, a weak attempt to pretend nothing had just happened. “Yeah, work will help.” Her voice cracked softly on the last word.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rose slowly, her own heart aching as she watched Rio struggling to regain composure. She crossed the space between them, cautiously approaching her wife. Rio stiffened at the nearness, clearly feeling Agatha’s presence, yet remained painfully still.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispered gently.</p><p> </p><p>There was no response. Just silence and the slightest shake of her wife’s head.</p><p> </p><p>“We’re going to have to talk about this eventually,” Agatha murmured. “But if you need to go, if you think that’ll help- I’m not here to push you. I’m fighting alongside you, not against you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned sharply, and the motion made Agatha jump. The breath caught in her chest as she took in the sight before her. She had never seen Rio like this. Tears streaked down her face, her expression stricken. Her arms crossed over her chest like armor, and her teeth sank into her bottom lip. Her brown eyes, wide and shining, locked onto Agatha’s with a desperation that made it hard to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Her wife looked to the backdoor, then back, shaking her head like she didn’t understand the world anymore. Her voice, when it came, broke into a soft, aching, cry:</p><p> </p><p>“She’s my baby.”</p><p> </p><p>This was the cry of a mother- so pure, so aching, it cut straight through Agatha. It came from from love so deep it bordered on agony. It was a sound pulled from the deepest part of Rio, from the years spent holding a tiny body to her chest, whispering promises to keep her safe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew exactly what Rio was trying to say, even if she couldn’t fully say it: She wanted to let go. To stop carrying Death. To finally rest. But every time she pictured that release, it brought her wife back to Sage. Their daughter. The child her wife had watched grow, stumble, laugh, rage, and become. It was love and devotion at its fiercest.  And that same love and devotion made the thought of handing her that burden feel like a betrayal. </p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t just fighting the role. She was fighting every instinct she had to protect her child from the very thing she herself no longer wanted to bear.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha thought she was going to be fucking sick.</p><p> </p><p>Her stomach turned, her vision swam, and none of it felt real- not Rio’s voice, not the tears, not the unbearable way she looked at Agatha. She reached out without thinking, pulling her wife in and tucking Rio’s head into the crook of her neck, like maybe she could hold her together if she just held Rio close enough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t cry. She didn’t even move. She just let herself be held, limp and quiet in Agatha’s arms, like the fight had drained out of her completely. Agatha kissed the side of her head over and over, not sure if she was trying to comfort Rio or keep herself from falling apart.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s mind was thick with fog. Every thought felt half formed, scattered, like her body was moving faster than her brain could follow. But even in the haze, one thing rose with terrible clarity: Rio needed to go.</p><p> </p><p>Not away. Not forever. But out.</p><p> </p><p>Out of this realm. She needed to wear Death again. Agatha knew it was the only thing tethering Rio to herself right now. Agatha couldn’t reach her. Sage couldn’t reach her. But maybe the work could.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not gonna beat around the bush,” Agatha whispered into her hair, her lips barely moving. “You need to go.”</p><p> </p><p>She felt Rio nod against her, hard and fast, like she’d just been waiting for permission.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled back gently, taking Rio’s face in her hands. Her thumbs brushed against damp cheeks as she looked into those eyes, still wide, still burning.</p><p> </p><p>“But come home to me,” she said, steady despite the storm raging in her chest. “Don’t be too long. I’ll be here when you get back.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, her hands sliding up to grasp Agatha’s wrists like they always did. She leaned forward until their foreheads touched, her eyes fluttering shut as she exhaled a slow, shaky breath.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave the smallest shake of her head, as much as Rio’s closeness would allow. She didn’t know what Rio was apologizing for. It could’ve been anything. Everything. None of it mattered right now. They’d talk when she got back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes opened slowly, brown and glassy and soft. “I love you so much,” her wife whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you too.”</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t soft. It was everything all at once. Desperate and aching. Her wife’s mouth parted, beckoning Agatha in like she needed to be known completely. Agatha answered her with no hesitation. She kissed Rio back with everything she had.</p><p> </p><p>Her tongue slipped into Rio’s mouth. She mapped every inch- sweeping across the roof of her wife’s mouth, grazing the edges of her teeth, sliding against Rio’s tongue. Agatha poured everything into it. Devotion. Longing. A need to hold her wife together with nothing but her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t tell where one of them ended and the other began.</p><p> </p><p>All she knew was Rio. The shape of her. The taste of her. The way her wife’s body trembled.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed Agatha like she was trying to burn this moment into her memory.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed Rio like she already knew it by heart.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted slightly, she was savoring something decadent, Rio’s mouth was hers to explore.</p><p> </p><p>She sucked on Rio’s tongue and the moan that tore out of wife’s throat was helpless. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha devoured the sound that belonged to her.</p><p> </p><p>Before she could even register it, the creak of the back door had Rio tearing herself away in an instant. One second her wife was in her arms, and the next, she was gone. Agatha’s mouth chased after air, eyes still half lidded, stunned. </p><p> </p><p>Rio turned, fast, and Agatha could see her wiping at her mouth, trying to erase the kiss like it hadn’t just leveled them both.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! I finally picked a boo-” Sage’s voice rang from behind them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha exhaled. <em> Perfect timing. </em> She turned, trying to smooth the irritated expression from her face, and found Sage standing in front of the back door, holding up a book mid sentence. Frozen.</p><p> </p><p>The book lowered slowly to her side.</p><p> </p><p>“Gross,” Sage mumbled, avoiding eye contact.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had already turned back around, the mask she’d been struggling to pull back on moments ago now sat exactly where it needed to be.  A smile sat neatly on her lips, but it looked like it hurt to wear and it didn’t come anywhere near her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Petal,” she said, walking toward Sage. “I’m gonna head up to the surface for a bit.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s brows pulled in, “Work?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s eyes went to Agatha. Her mouth parted, ready to push back, but Agatha met her with a look that said <em> don’t. </em> </p><p> </p><p>Sage held her tongue. Her brow furrowed tighter, jaw clenched like she wanted to say ten things at once. But Rio was already pulling their daughter into a hug.</p><p> </p><p>Above them, the clouds were gathering. Not dark enough to threaten rain, but dense and restless, like they didn’t know what they wanted to be yet. </p><p> </p><p>Over Rio’s shoulder, Sage stared at Agatha, wide eyed and silent, confusion written all over her face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio mumbled into Sage’s hair, a quick “I love you. I’ll be back later.”</p><p> </p><p>“I love you too,” Sage replied, her voice quiet, unsure, still trying to make sense of what had just happened. </p><p> </p><p>Sage stepped aside, no longer blocking the door, and watched as Rio walked away. The door closed behind her with a soft click, and Sage just stood there, stunned.</p><p> </p><p>“What the fuck just happened?” Sage asked.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever <em>that</em> had been, it belonged to Rio and Agatha wasn’t about to hand it over just because Sage had questions.</p><p> </p><p>“Can someone just tell me what the fuck is going on?” Sage shouted, voice breaking. She wasn’t yelling at Agatha. Just at the mess of it all. </p><p> </p><p>Thunder growled in the distance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said quietly, “She’ll figure it out. It’ll be okay.”</p><p> </p><p>That wasn’t true. Not fully. She didn’t have the answers Sage needed. She didn’t even have them for herself. None that had come directly from Rio’s own mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s brow pulled in, tighter than before. “Figure what out? What does that mean? Why is she being so fucking weird?” Her voice cracked again, this time smaller. Pleading.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it wasn’t the right thing to say, but Agatha felt like someone had yanked the ground out from under her and she’d landed so hard on her ass that it shook the world. It was everything Rio didn’t say. The way she looked at Agatha. The way she looked at Sage. The reason she had to leave. And yeah, that kiss still lingered, and it didn’t fucking help.</p><p> </p><p>Raindrops started to fall, light at first, barely there. Then steadier. A few clung to Sage’s hair, catching in the mess of a ponytail she still hadn’t bothered to fix. Agatha watched the raindrops gather and slide down her daughter’s cheek like they didn’t know the difference between weather and heartache.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage, please. Calm down,” Agatha said, trying to steady her voice.</p><p> </p><p>Sage stepped closer. “Are you mad at each other? Is she mad at me? Are you mad at me?” Her eyes searched Agatha’s face,  “Will you just give me something? Anything? Please, Mo-”</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter’s mouth snapped shut. She looked away fast like the word had startled even her. But she caught herself. Too late to pretend it hadn’t almost slipped out, but just early enough to shove it back down.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the ache start in her chest. The almost was worse than silence. </p><p> </p><p>Sage looked up again, voice thin. “Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wanted it.</p><p> </p><p>Some days it hovered right there, just at the edge of her daughter’s lips. Only once had there been an offhanded "Ma," tossed out so casually Sage hadn’t caught it. Not then. But now- now it was starting to feel like it was just the butt of a joke Agatha didn’t understand. And still, after all this time, it hadn’t come again. Just these almosts. These little slips Sage always caught in time.</p><p> </p><p>“Why won’t you just say it?” Agatha asked, her own voice far more vulnerable than she was comfortable with.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t meant to. The words slipped out before she could stop them, pulled out of her mouth by a single unfinished syllable. A tiny thing that lived in the background of her mind until it made itself known. And when it did, it was always so fucking loud.</p><p> </p><p>It was just a word. A sound. Agatha didn’t need to hear it to know what she was, who she was. So it shouldn’t have mattered.</p><p> </p><p>But it did.</p><p> </p><p>For reasons Agatha couldn’t explain, even to herself, it still did. Maybe because it felt like a luxury she hadn’t been allowed to hold in so long that she barely remembered what it felt like. And now that it was close enough to touch, she wanted it back. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha deserved it back.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t respond. She just deflated- guilt settling in for one mother, while the worry she carried for the other refused to let go.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned. She backpedaled.</p><p> </p><p>“Your mom’s fine.” The second it left Agatha’s mouth, she regretted it. It sounded like a correction. Like she was putting distance between them on purpose. She winced.</p><p> </p><p>“Sorry. I just meant- she’s not mad. I’m not mad. Nothing’s wrong. Everything’s okay.”</p><p> </p><p>It was a lie. A kind one. But still a lie. </p><p> </p><p>It gave her a little space, a little more time to avoid the conversation she wasn’t ready to have. Because Rio was not okay. Not even close. But Agatha was sure -<em> she had to be sure </em>- that everything would be.</p><p> </p><p>“She’ll come home,” Agatha said. “And I promise, everything will go back to normal.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure if she was saying it for Sage’s sake or her own. Maybe both. Maybe that was the only way either of them could believe it.</p><p> </p><p>It had stopped raining. Only heavy gray clouds hung in the sky.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha held her breath, praying her rambling had done its job- dodging her own humiliating question and slapping the Rio talk onto the back burner where it belonged.</p><p> </p><p>Sage just stared at her. Then her eyes widened, and she blew a raspberry before saying, “It’s nine in the morning.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha snatched the bone Sage threw her like her life depended on it, “You’re fucking kidding me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Not even a little.”</p><p> </p><p>It was only nine a.m., and Agatha felt like she’d survived a decade long war, three plagues, and a tax audit. And they hadn’t even made it through the morning yet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed- really laughed. It stole her breath and made her double over, because what the actual fuck?</p><p> </p><p>Sage just stared at her, a smug little smile tugging at her mouth. “Want to go in and watch TV with me?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure,” Agatha managed between the dying echoes of her giggle fit, breathless and lightheaded.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>A few hours slipped by in relative silence. Both of them were absorbed in the reality show Sage had put on- only breaking the quiet to laugh or psychoanalyze whichever idiot had done something impressively stupid.</p><p> </p><p>They sat on opposite ends of the couch, Sage propped against the armrest with her legs stretched out and resting comfortably in Agatha’s lap.</p><p> </p><p>“So…” Sage drawled, breaking the silence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her head fall back against the couch with a groan. She was already bracing herself for whatever ridiculous thing was about to come out of her daughter’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>“In your long, long, looon-”</p><p> </p><p>“I get it,” she snapped, lifting her head to glare at Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Sage just grinned. “Have you encountered many ghosts?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. Just one. Conjured up from the imagination of a teenager.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage wrinkled her nose in disgust. “Ugh. I should’ve siphoned all the magic out of that twink when I had the chance.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went still.</p><p> </p><p>Sage noticed, “Sorry. But he’s annoying as fuck.”</p><p> </p><p>She assumed the look on Agatha’s face was from offense- a soft spot for the boy, maybe. But it wasn’t that.</p><p> </p><p>“You can do that?” Agatha asked, her voice quieter than she intended.</p><p> </p><p>Sage nodded, a small smile playing at her lips. “Like mother, like daughter.”</p><p> </p><p>For a reason she didn’t say aloud, Agatha’s chest tightened. It was pride and it settled deep in her bones. That smile, that certainty- it mirrored Agatha’s own, from another life. The same power, clear as day. Not only passed down, but alive again. As if magic had chosen to remember, and chosen her daughter to carry it forward.</p><p> </p><p>“How did you find out?” she asked. A thousand questions were already swarming through her mind. Had Sage done it before? Could she control it? Had she learned to control it from Rio, or figured it out on her own? There were so many ways it could’ve gone wrong.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t answer right away. She pressed her lips together, then glanced away before meeting Agatha’s eyes again.</p><p> </p><p>“Call it a gut feeling.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could see it all over her daughter’s face. Something had happened. Something Sage was scared to say out loud. And whatever it was, Agatha had the uneasy feeling it ended with a witch dead at her daughter's feet. Whether Sage meant to or not, she didn’t know.</p><p> </p><p>“Can you control it?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>It broke Agatha’s heart a little bit. She knew exactly what that felt like.</p><p> </p><p>Yes, she’d been power hungry. Yes, she’d killed witches- <em>intentionally</em>. But there had been the frustration. The helplessness. The shame of having so much knowledge, so much skill, in everything else… and still being at the mercy of the one thing that was supposed to be hers <em> . </em> Her power. Her birthright. And it refused to listen.</p><p> </p><p>No one had ever asked Agatha to explain what was happening to her. No had bothered to understand. They saw the magic, the damage, the potential for destruction and decided that was all she was. Her coven didn’t give her the chance to speak, let alone a space to learn to control it.</p><p> </p><p>They were afraid of Agatha before they even knew her. </p><p> </p><p>Rio had been the first to look at Agatha's power and not flinch. The first to reach out a hand instead of recoiling.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked hard, pulling herself back to the present. Sage wasn’t her. But the pain in her daughter's eyes- it was familiar.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio didn’t teach you how to control it?” Agatha asked.</p><p> </p><p>She had taught Agatha. Taught her how to ground herself. How to find the one clear voice in her head that wasn't consumed by the rush of magic flooding her veins. It was never about guilt. Agatha hadn’t wanted control because she felt bad for killing witches. She didn’t care. And neither did Rio.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio first asked if she wanted to learn, Agatha had been fucking furious. Why would Death care if she was taking souls? She was killing witches. Efficiently. If anything, Rio should’ve been thanking Agatha for keeping her employed.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio hadn’t asked because she cared about the people dying. She asked because no one else ever had. Because someone, for once, saw Agatha not as a threat to contain, but as a person who had never been given a choice.</p><p> </p><p>Rio never told her to stop. She just offered help. Quiet, steady help. If Agatha wanted it.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shook her head. “She offered. More than once, actually. I didn’t want help.”</p><p> </p><p>“Believe it or not, you can’t figure everything out on your own, Sage,” Agatha said. Her daughter’s stubbornness was impressive, but it would end up getting in the way if she let it.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shook her head again. “No. I didn’t want <em> her </em> help. Not with that.” She paused, eyes flicking away before she added, “It didn’t feel right coming from her.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brow creased, “Who else would-”</p><p> </p><p><em> Oh </em>.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cleared her throat.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, well… if you ever want to,” Agatha said, trying to keep it light. “I can teach you. Learn from the expert herself.”</p><p> </p><p>It came out messier than she intended. Sage could have gone to Rio, had every chance to, but she hadn’t. She wanted Agatha’s help. That knowledge settled warm in Agatha’s chest, unexpected and a little overwhelming.</p><p> </p><p>“I’d love that,” Sage said, and she meant it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed out a laugh and waved a hand through the air, trying to shake off the sudden mush of emotion. “Back to your earlier question- ghosts. Why’d you ask?”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, right.” Sage sat up a little, “So, yeah, everyone knows ghosts hang around because of unfinished business. That part’s easy. But the part people get wrong is thinking they get to finish it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly, already unsettled.</p><p> </p><p>Sage continued, “They don’t get to decide when it’s over. They don’t even know what the ‘business’ actually is most of the time. It’s not like, forgive this person, say goodbye to that one, and it’s done. It doesn’t work like that. When you’re a ghost, you’re outside of everything. Not part of the balance. Not held by Death. Not claimed by Life. You’re in the middle. Oblivion. And in that space, your agency gets fuzzy. The rules change. It’s not about what you think you need. It’s about what the oblivion thinks you’re still tied to.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt something cold settle in her gut.</p><p> </p><p>Sage went on, “Sometimes it’s a memory. A person. A moment you didn’t even realize mattered until it’s too late. You’re stuck because something won’t let go of you, not the other way around. And you can’t move on until it decides it’s done.” She said it plainly, like she was reciting something she had known for a long time.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s your point, Sage?” Agatha asked, flatly.</p><p> </p><p>“My point is, you asked why I haven’t called you…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away, her jaw tightening. She was still irritated with herself for letting that slip. It was a lapse. A moment of weakness she hadn't gotten a handle on fast enough.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Agatha muttered. “I don’t care that much. Was just curious.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage gave her a look, like she could see straight through that lie, but didn’t call her on it.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ve been thinking about it,” Sage said instead. “Why you’re still here. Why the oblivion hasn’t let go of you yet. And it’s not Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t move, but her fingers curled slightly in her lap.</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter paused, seeming to choose her next words carefully.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, an ideal afterlife would probably have her in it. I know you’d want that. But the oblivion doesn’t deal in ideals. It knows that’s impossible. So if you’re still here, it’s probably not about her. At least, not in the way people assume.”</p><p> </p><p>“And I don’t think it’s about Nicky anymore either. Maybe once, but not now. You’re not scared of seeing him. Not like before. So I feel like the reasons for keeping you here are starting to run out.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage was right.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed the bile rising in her throat. She hated this.</p><p> </p><p>Hated knowing the already short timeline she had might be even shorter than she thought. She’d convinced herself there was some kind of choice in all of it- that staying meant something. That she had control.</p><p> </p><p>Whatever was keeping her here, the oblivion was probably working through it in silence, checking off reasons one by one. No care, no warning. Just cold inevitability. Like her existence was an inconvenience being quietly resolved.</p><p> </p><p>Another box ticked. Another thing scratched off the list.</p><p> </p><p>“I guess what I’m trying to say is… I don’t want to be another thing the oblivion is waiting on to let you go.” Sage paused, then added quickly, “I know that’s selfish. I just want more time. With all of us. So I thought… maybe if I didn’t say it out loud, we’d get to keep it a little longer. Does that make sense?”</p><p> </p><p>It did make sense. But that didn’t mean Agatha had to fucking like it.</p><p> </p><p>Even as a ghost, the universe still seemed to have it out for Agatha Harkness- the mother, the wife.</p><p> </p><p>Her own daughter was afraid to speak a word.  As if saying it out loud might snap something and push her straight into the afterlife.</p><p> </p><p>And the worst part? She was grateful for it now. Grateful for the silence. Because, yes, she wanted more time. She wasn’t ready to let go of this. But she had also made peace with the idea of seeing her son again. She had prepared herself for it.</p><p> </p><p>What she couldn’t stomach... what made her sick to even imagine.. was what it might cost.</p><p> </p><p>If she ever heard that word from Nicky, it would be over. No more Rio.</p><p> </p><p>And if Sage said it?</p><p> </p><p>It could be enough. Just enough to push the oblivion into letting her go. No more Rio.</p><p> </p><p>To hear that word from either one of her children’s mouths would mean no more Rio.</p><p> </p><p>That possibility sat in her like fucking lead poisoning. </p><p> </p><p>All these inevitabilities, these forces beyond her reach: eternity, fate, oblivion, the indifferent clockwork of the universe- they had all taken one long look at Agatha Harkness and decided she wasn’t worthy. That no matter how much she wanted, how hard she clung, she couldn’t have it all.</p><p> </p><p>And if those forces had faces, Agatha would have spit in every single one.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was ripped from her thoughts so abruptly she flinched at the sound of her daughter’s voice. She turned to see Sage sitting cross legged beside her, close now, watching her with those sad, worried green eyes that nearly rivaled Rio’s sad brown.</p><p> </p><p>“What?” Agatha asked, disoriented. Her mind was still tangled in everything she hadn’t said out loud.</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t mean to upset you,” Sage said softly. “I just wanted you to know that I want to say it. I’ve wanted to. And you are my…” She trailed off. Didn’t finish it. “I just thought you should know.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, “You have said it.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage gave a small nod, like she already knew what Agatha meant. “Yeah. I know. It just feels different now.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, then reached out and grabbed a handful of Sage’s hoodie, tugging her into a hug. It was awkward at the angle, limbs bending the wrong way, but Sage didn’t hesitate. She leaned in and held her.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Sage mumbled into her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you too, Sage,” Agatha said quietly. Then she gave her daughter a gentle shove. “Now get off me.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage laughed, the sound muffled but real.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Later that night, Agatha was tucked into bed, watching her third nature documentary in a row. Sage had gone to bed hours ago, and Agatha had stayed in the living room until the silence started to make her skin crawl.</p><p> </p><p>Rio still wasn’t home.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t even remember the last time she’d gone to bed without her. It felt wrong without her and Agatha was fucking struggling.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh to herself. Fourteen hours. Not even a full day, and she felt unmoored. What the fuck was the afterlife going to be like without Rio in it?</p><p> </p><p>A knock on the door snapped her out of the thought. She sat up fast, too fast, and blurted, “Come in,” with way too much hope in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>The door creaked open, and all that hope drained when she saw Sage standing there.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha quickly smoothed her expression.</p><p> </p><p>Sage crossed her arms and shifted in the doorway. “Damn. Don’t look so disappointed to see your only daughter.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, “What do you want?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s gaze dropped to the floor, “Had a nightmare.”</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, and now you need Mommy to cuddle you back to sleep?” Agatha said, full pout, full sarcasm.</p><p> </p><p>“And so the fuck what?” Sage shot back, already crossing the room and throwing herself onto the bed, right into Rio’s spot.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat propped against the headboard while Sage lay beside her. She got maybe ten minutes of silence before Sage spoke again.</p><p> </p><p>“Would you want her to give It up? Like... is that something you’d actually want?” Sage asked, voice small and curious.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kept her eyes on the TV, “No.”</p><p> </p><p><em> Yes </em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Why not?” Sage didn’t sound offended, just genuinely interested.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha risked a glance down at her. “Not if it meant you being the one to take It on.” Then she looked back at the screen.</p><p> </p><p>“Take me out of the equation then.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed and rolled her eyes, which she was pretty sure she’d done at least six hundred times that day. “You’re just full of questions tonight, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s not an answer.”</p><p> </p><p>“Of course,” Agatha snapped, harsher than she intended. She reeled it back before continuing. “Of course I would want her to. But that’s not how it plays out. So no. My answer’s no.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage scoffed. “God. You’re both so fucking annoying.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed. She looked down at her daughter, “Excuse me?”</p><p> </p><p>“You both want it,” Sage said, arms crossed. “I mean, come on. Mom’s been having an existential crisis for- I don’t even know how long at this point.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw dropped.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh, don’t look at me like that,” Sage snapped. “I’m not stupid. I just want someone to be honest with me for once. Not talk around me like I’m five years old and just asked how babies are made.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha said nothing. She couldn’t. The silence only made Sage angrier.</p><p> </p><p>Sage threw her arms up and sat up, eyes locked on Agatha. “I don’t get it. Why is this such a big deal? You both want it. She just needs to grow a fucking spine and do it.”</p><p> </p><p>“The big deal is,” Agatha said sharply, “is that it would be you taking It on.”</p><p> </p><p>“So?” Sage’s voice rose, frustrated now, “Why does that matter?”</p><p> </p><p>Thunder rolled in the distance.</p><p> </p><p>“Because it does,” Agatha snapped. “Because we care. Because we’re your mothers, and this thing… it’s not a gift. It’s not noble. It’s a sentence. You don’t get to hand it off. You don’t get a retirement plan. It’s forever, Sage. That’s what you’re asking for.”</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t believe her daughter was even questioning it.</p><p> </p><p>“I know what I’m asking for!” Sage snapped back and lightning struck. “You don’t think I’ve lived it already? I’ve seen what it does. And maybe it’ll do the same to me. Or maybe I’ll find a way to make it different. I don’t care. She’s tired. You’re tired. You’re both fucking tired.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha probably looked like she’d been slapped. But she didn’t deny it.</p><p> </p><p>Sage pressed on, “She doesn’t want to do this anymore. And I could end it. I could give her peace. I could give you both peace.”</p><p> </p><p>She paused, breathing hard, eyes flicking toward the ceiling like she was holding back tears. Then, more quietly, “Why won’t you just let me?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha inhaled slowly, steadying herself before she spoke. Her voice wasn’t cruel, but it was firm. It was deliberate in the way only a mother’s could be when she was trying not to fall apart.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage, I’m going to give you some tough love here, okay? You’re a child.”</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not,” Sage snapped, immediate and defensive.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t stop. “You are. You’re still learning how to exist inside your own skin. The weather throws a tantrum every time you feel anything too strongly. You think that means you're ready to carry the fucking mantle of Death?”</p><p> </p><p>As if summoned by her words, the soft patter of rain started tapping against the window.</p><p> </p><p>“I can control it,” Sage shot back, her voice already cracking.</p><p> </p><p>“No, you can’t,” Agatha said, her tone rising. “You can’t even control your magic. Not really.”</p><p> </p><p>“So teach me!” Sage cried, and this time the words stuck in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Lightning flashed again outside the window, slicing the room in white for a moment before more thunder followed close behind.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice broke through it. “You came in here because you had a nightmare.<em> A nightmare </em>. And you want me to believe you’re ready to be Death? That you’re ready to carry the entire fucking balance on your shoulders?” Her laugh was hollow, “That’s insane.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t shout this time. Her voice came quieter, but it hit harder. “Maybe I just wanted to spend time with my fucking mom. Ever think of that?”</p><p> </p><p>The storm surged.</p><p> </p><p>Wind howled against the walls. Rain lashed the windows in waves. The lights in the room flickered. The realm itself was waiting to see what would break first- mother or daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jerked back, startled by the force of it, her eyes wide. They both sat in the aftermath, the air stretched thin between them, even the storm was holding its breath.</p><p> </p><p>But nothing shattered. Not yet.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, gathered herself again, then opened them with a calm that was more tired than composed.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m tabling this conversation,” Agatha said, the authority in her voice final. “You can stay here or you can go, sleep or don’t, I don’t care. But I’m done talking about it tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage barked at her in frustration and flung herself down into the bed like she was launching into battle. She twisted hard onto her side, yanking the covers with her, then shoved her back toward Agatha just enough for her shoulders to rest against Agatha’s legs.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. <em> Predictable. </em>Her and Rio, cut from the same damn cloth. Furious one second, curled up at her side the next, still needing to be close, even when they were pissed off at her.</p><p> </p><p>“I hate you,” Sage muttered, her voice muffled into Rio’s pillow.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t so much as blink. “No, you don’t,” she said simply, eyes drifting back to the documentary she’d barely been following.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever,” Sage grumbled, the sound trailing into the blanket.</p><p> </p><p>Silence settled over them again, not exactly peaceful, but familiar. They sat with it for a few minutes before Agatha heard a small, reluctant voice mumble into the dark.</p><p> </p><p>“Love you. Goodnight.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let the smirk tug at her lips before answering.</p><p> </p><p>“Love you too.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t slept. Morning had come, and she was still wide awake, half watching a documentary on deep sea ecosystems. Something about how the female anglerfish survives in total darkness, carrying the shriveled remains of her mate fused into her flesh like an afterthought. It was grotesque. She couldn’t look away. She loved it.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers moved absently through Sage’s hair.</p><p> </p><p>At some point during the night, Sage had rolled over and pressed herself against Agatha’s side, one arm slung across her thighs like she’d always fit there. Agatha ignored the tight pull in her chest. Maybe she’d overdone it, calling her a child. Sage was 268 years old, for fuck’s sake but age didn’t mean maturity, and Agatha still didn’t want to think about last night. Sage hadn’t wanted a conversation, just a yes, and when Agatha wouldn’t give it to her, the night had ended in shouting.</p><p> </p><p>And yet here she was. Curled up beside the woman she barely knew, the mother she’d practically dragged back from the grave. There was no logic to it. But Agatha could feel it, beneath all that pride and defiance, Sage still needed her. Because even the ancient, arrogant ones sometimes reached for things they were never meant to have, just to see if it would stay this time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t miss the irony of that last thought. Clearly, it ran in the family.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was just starting to drift into the calm rhythm of the narration when Sage shot upright in bed with so much force it made Agatha jump like she’d been shocked.</p><p> </p><p>Sage clutched her chest, “Fuck!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha bolted upright, “What’s wrong? Are you dying?!”</p><p> </p><p>Sage wasn’t dying, but Agatha’s brain short circuited at the sound of her daughter’s pain, at the way she was grabbing her chest like she was having a goddamn heart attack.</p><p> </p><p>There was no answer. Sage rolled off the bed and landed on the floor with a heavy thud. “Okay! I’m awake!” she grunted, breath shallow, like the words hurt coming out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scrambled forward and leaned over the edge of the bed. “Sage! Are! You! Okay?!” She was yelling now, sheer panic lacing every word.</p><p> </p><p>Sage groaned a yes and staggered upright, one hand still pressed to her chest. She started toward the door, tripping over furniture, swearing under her breath. “I’m on my fucking way. Jesus… calm down,” she rasped, voice wrecked and shaking.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stayed frozen, watching her stumble through the room like she was drunk or had just been shot. Sage reached the door and flung it open with her usual dramatic flair, only to collapse against the frame, bent forward, gasping for air.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage!” Agatha shouted again, standing now, barefoot on the mattress. “What the fuck is going on?!”</p><p> </p><p>Sage turned slowly, her back pressed against the doorframe. This time her daughter looked at her.</p><p> </p><p>“Your-” Sage dragged in a breath, still gripping her chest. “Wife. Is. Calling. Me. To the surface.” Each word landed with a pause between, but her breathing was already starting to level out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked. “Well, fuck, is it like that every time? You looked like you were dying!” She was still standing on the bed, still shouting at full volume.</p><p> </p><p>Sage shook her head, still panting. “Only when she’s trying to wake me up. Heavy sleeper.” She shrugged.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Of course.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio had been calling Sage to the garden every day. And just like that, the obnoxiously loud chaos of Sage’s mornings actually made sense.</p><p> </p><p>“Get fucking cell phones, then!” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>“Stop yelling,” Sage muttered, finally pushing off the doorframe. “I’m fine.”</p><p> </p><p>She actually looked like it now. No longer bent in half, no longer white knuckling her chest. Just annoyed. Agatha climbed down from the bed.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me get dressed. I’m going with you.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage shook her head. “No. If she’s calling me up there, it probably means she wants me out of the way when she gets back. You should stay. She’ll be home soon.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, “How do you know that?”</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t.” Sage shrugged. “Lucky guess?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, ready to argue but it tracked. Especially if Rio was finally planning to return with something to say. Something that might actually crack open the truth of whatever the fuck was going on in her wife’s head. Agatha hated how much sense it made.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together and gave a small nod, “Well. Get out of here, then.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage nodded back and turned to leave, already halfway through the doorway when Agatha called after her, “And don’t do anything fucking stupid."</p><p> </p><p><em> Be safe, please. </em> Is what Agatha meant.</p><p> </p><p>From somewhere down the hall, Sage shouted, “No promises! Love you!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t think she’d ever get tired of hearing that.</p><p> </p><p>“Love you too,” she said, barely above a whisper, to the room Sage had already left behind.</p>

<p>Agatha showered, got dressed or started to, anyway. She did her hair. Her makeup. Then she wandered into the closet she shared with Rio and stopped in front of her side of it, completely ass naked, just staring.</p><p> </p><p>The conversation ahead still hovered over her like a guillotine, blade poised, waiting to drop. Nearly every moment of the past twenty four hours had felt like being hit by a bus. Emotionally, spiritually, and maybe a little cosmically. But that didn’t mean she didn’t want to look fucking hot for her wife’s return.</p><p> </p><p>Sue her.</p><p> </p><p>She missed Rio. And no matter how complicated everything had become, Agatha was still glad she was coming home.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Home. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Where the heart was, or whatever that bullshit saying is.</p><p> </p><p>Except Agatha’s heart was fractured. Two-thirds here, one-third missing. The part she missed hurt like hell if she thought about it too long. But this? This was the closest she’d ever come to a home in her entire life. She wasn’t ready to lose it.</p><p> </p><p>She finally settled on a baby blue collared shirt, the sleeves neatly rolled up, tucked into loose tan slacks and cinched with a black leather belt. Standing in front of the bathroom mirror, she gave herself a once over and nodded, satisfied.</p><p> </p><p>“Check me out,” she muttered to her reflection.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was pacing the living room. Too anxious to sit, too restless to breathe properly. It had been two hours since Sage left, and every minute that passed only made the silence feel louder. She was on what had to be her twentieth lap when the front door clicked open.</p><p> </p><p>She froze mid step, right at the threshold of the living room, and watched.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped through the foyer like a ghost returning to her own life. For a second, it looked like she might walk right past Agatha, eyes far away, until recognition flickered and she turned.</p><p> </p><p>They stood just a few feet apart.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was in that damn outfit she’d worn on The Road. The off the shoulder brown top that looked like rotting lace, clinging to her like it belonged there. The twisted vine, moss textured pants that wound tight around her legs. The wide belt slung low on her hips, her dagger sitting snug at her side. She was barefoot. The crown of Death sat like it had molded to the shape of her.</p><p> </p><p>Her cheeks were hollow, the skin beneath her eyes bruised dark. Her hair had grown long and black. She looked like Death.</p><p> </p><p>And still, she was Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch at the sight of her. If anything, her heart ached with how much she loved her. Every strange, terrifying, sacred inch. She wanted to cradle that black heart in her palms, not to soften it, but to shield it. To say, <em> stay. Please. </em></p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know how long they stood like that, suspended. Rio reached up and removed her crown, holding it lightly in both hands, fingers curled around it like it might dissolve if she wasn’t careful.</p><p> </p><p>“You look beautiful,” Rio said, a small smile tugging at the corner of her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her chest tighten. She exhaled. “You look-”</p><p> </p><p>“Like death?” Rio cut in gently.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> A goddess I was born to worship until time forgets us both. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>That was what Agatha wanted to say.</p><p> </p><p>Instead, she shrugged and said, “Still fucking hot though.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, and there it was- that maddening, perfect gap between her front teeth. She huffed a soft laugh and shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you gonna kiss your wife hello or what?”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck yes,” Agatha breathed, already closing the distance between them.</p><p> </p><p>When their lips met, Rio gasped against her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slid her fingers into her wife’s hair and tugged her closer, tilting her head and parting her own lips in invitation. She wanted Rio to remember this. The taste. The heat. The reason to come home.</p><p> </p><p>Somewhere beside them, Agatha heard the soft clink of Rio’s crown hitting the floor, but it barely registered. There wasn’t room for thought, not with her wife’s tongue down her throat and Rio's body pressed close like she never meant to leave in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>It was another one of those kisses. The kind that devoured. The kind that could take Agatha straight to the grave and make her grateful for the ride. She felt every aching second of Rio’s absence in it, every bit of longing poured into her mouth like a promise.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her back with the same desperation, not to match it, but to answer it.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally pulled back, breathless and dazed, Rio whimpered and chased her lips like she couldn’t stand the loss of contact. Agatha gave in, let her close the distance again. The second their mouths met, Rio moaned into the kiss, and <em> fuck </em>, Agatha would give anything to keep her sounding like that. She never wanted her quiet again. Not when it felt like the kind of thing people searched lifetimes for and never found.</p><p> </p><p>It was intoxicating. Agatha was chasing the high, and Rio met her there, arms winding around her waist to pull them impossibly closer. Their mouths moved together, hot and aching and desperate. Neither of them wanted to stop. It felt like an answer to every question Agatha had been too afraid to ask.</p><p> </p><p>When she finally did pull away again, Rio let out a frustrated whine, already leaning back in, lips parted and pleading.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha caught her gently with a thumb pressed to them. “Easy, tiger,” she murmured. “Don’t act like this is the last.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a breath that trembled against her skin, then dropped her forehead to Agatha’s. Without a word, she took Agatha’s thumb into her mouth and sucked down to the knuckle.</p><p> </p><p>A soft moan slipped from Rio’s throat. A quiet whimper followed from Agatha’s.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha pulled her thumb free, voice uneven. “You’re distracting me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s half lidded gaze lifted to meet hers, “Is it working?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha whispered without thinking. She blinked, shook her head. “I mean no. Absolutely not.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes dropped to Rio’s kiss swollen lips, her wife's teeth worrying at them.</p><p> </p><p>“Definitely yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, “I’m gonna shower and change. I’ll see you out here in a little, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could only nod. Her brain barely registered the words, too consumed with watching the curve of Rio’s mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned in and kissed her one more time before turning to leave. Her wife didn’t even glance at the crown she’d left on the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched Rio walk away, and for the first time in days, the weight on her chest loosened. Just a little. The conversation still hung in the air between them like storm clouds waiting to break, and it sure as fuck wouldn’t be easy. But she wasn’t afraid of it ending in another fight that would stretch on for centuries.</p><p> </p><p>They’d get through it. That was what Agatha had to believe.</p><p> </p><p>She collapsed onto the couch, limbs sprawled, her heart still caught somewhere in the threshold where Rio had stood. It felt like waiting for someone to return from war. And maybe that was dramatic- Agatha didn’t care. She was in love. And she wasn’t going to let a dozen imagined disasters or eventual betrayals take that away from her. Not now. Not when Rio was here. Not when she could still feel her wife’s mouth on hers.</p><p> </p><p>All the inevitable endings could wait.</p><p> </p><p>Right now, she just wanted her wife.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio returned, she wore a soft, tight black fitted shirt paired with jeans. She looked like she hadn’t just walked through hell. She looked like home.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hair was still damp, and even through the wet strands, Agatha could see it had already started to change. The black was fading, softening at her roots, and it was shorter now than when she arrived. Her cheeks looked a little fuller. The dark circles beneath her eyes had vanished.</p><p> </p><p>It always struck Agatha how easily Rio slipped into the shape of Life here. In this place where Death had once given to Life, and Life had given something back. The exchange lingered in the walls, in the air. It was quiet, sacred, and impossible to explain.</p><p> </p><p>It was breathtaking.</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked toward the couch, and Agatha sat up to make room for her. Before she sat, Rio held something out- a worn leather bound journal. It wasn’t Sage’s. That one was too new, too modern. This one was different. Older.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha took it without hesitation. “What’s this?” she asked, her fingers already brushing the worn cover.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sank down beside her, leaving almost no space between them.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s a journal I’ve kept. For after you and Sage…”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice faded. Her eyes shifted away, as if even now, the words were too much. She swallowed, then looked back at Agatha.</p><p> </p><p>“So you don’t forget?” Agatha asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded, barely. The smile she gave was small, practiced. It didn’t touch her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down at the book.</p><p> </p><p>It was easier to put the blame on Death, to point at something with a face and a name. But Death does not take. Time does. And Eternity is the hungriest of them all. </p><p> </p><p>Eternity is patient. It won’t break Rio all at once. That would be mercy. Instead, it erodes her slowly, taking the best of her in pieces so small she barely notices what’s gone until it’s too late.</p><p> </p><p>That was the punishment. Not the burden of Death itself, not the solitude of centuries, not even the endless procession of loss.</p><p> </p><p>Love was the crime.</p><p> </p><p>Love was Rio’s defiance and Eternity made sure it became her sentence.</p><p> </p><p>Every person Rio should hold close would be taken twice- first by death, then by time.</p><p> </p><p>The journal wasn't sentiment. It was preservation, survival. A desperate attempt to hold onto the parts of herself that time keeps trying to take. A way to carve permanence into a world that promised her none, save for her own existence.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha opened the journal to the first page.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Today, I choose a name. </em>
</p><p>
<em> A name that does not belong. A name that does not fit. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Rio Vidal. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Let it be the lie I live inside. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Let it be the closest I ever come to wanting more. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The next page was a portrait of her own face- drawn with delicate precision. It was from long ago. Centuries. Agatha could tell by the way her eyes were shaped, the way her mouth hadn’t yet learned to hide what she felt. If she had to guess, it was from the day she and Rio first met.</p><p> </p><p>Beneath the portrait, written in black ink:</p><p> </p><p>
<b> <em>Agatha Harkness - Your wife</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>Her birthday. Her birthplace. A brief note in the margin about the color of her magic.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Purple. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio, her brow furrowed. Rio only gave her a soft, silent nod toward the next page.</p><p> </p><p>She turned the page.</p><p> </p><p>Her breath caught.</p><p> </p><p>
<b> <em>Nicholas Scratch - Your son</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>His portrait showed him as a baby: round cheeks, arms full of softness, and a gummy smile that seemed far too big for his face. His hair was already a mess, wild and charming, and his eyes sparkled with contagious joy. He looked like Rio- so much it ached.</p><p> </p><p>His date of birth and the day of his death. His birthplace. </p><p> </p><p>A tiny note in the margin about the day he took his first steps.</p><p> </p><p><em> Very wobbly. Legs like a foal, pride like a king. </em> </p><p> </p><p>Another page.</p><p> </p><p>
<b> <em>Sage Vidal-Harkness  -  Your daughter</em> </b>
</p><p> </p><p>The portrait was of her as a baby- small, but with a presence that felt like she’d already lived a hundred lifetimes. Her expression was calm, serious, but the tiniest hint of a smile curled the corner of her lips, as though she held a secret.</p><p> </p><p>She was beautiful.</p><p> </p><p>The entry was the same- name, birthday, birthplace. </p><p> </p><p>Another note in the margin:</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Would only sleep if you were holding her. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. Her eyes stayed locked on the page, unblinking. </p><p> </p><p>“Rio,” she said, barely a whisper- half question, half ache.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s reply was quiet, careful, “Keep going, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> 1693: </em>
</p><p>
<em> You had learned to live without fire. </em>
</p><p>
<em> At some point, centuries ago, maybe longer, you knew warmth. You do not remember what it was, or who gave it to you. You only remember the echo of it. The way it used to feel. And then, nothing.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> You moved through time untouched, untouched by time. </em>
</p><p>
<em> That is who you became. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Until her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You saw her locked behind glass, staring back at you like she’d been waiting. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Something in you stuttered. You forgot how to move. For a moment, you forgot yourself. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She was beautiful. Piercing blue eyes, all sharp edges and hunger. The kind of beauty that came with fire beneath it. The kind you wanted to watch just to see what she’d set ablaze next. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You who have walked beside kings and storms and plagues- You who have been Death longer than all things have had names- Waited at a woman’s window like it was your only job. </em>
</p><p>
<em> And she didn't run. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She leaned into you. Teased you. Dared you to keep looking. </em>
</p><p>
<em> So you did. </em>
</p><p>
<em> That night, when she stood amongst dead bodies, locket swinging between her fingers, she looked at you like she had summoned you. Not by chance. On purpose. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You should have laughed. You should have vanished. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You didn’t. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You let her touch you. You touched her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You felt a spark in your chest. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Warmth. </em>
</p><p>
<em> And you burned. </em>

</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned through page after page, some filled with portraits of herself looking older, changed by time. Between them were journal entries from years she had always tried not to remember. Years before Nicky. Before Sage. Just the two of them.</p><p> </p><p>Her vision blurred as the sting of tears gathered, unbidden at the corners of her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> 1751-1756: </em>
</p><p>
<em> You never believed it could happen. </em>
</p><p>
<em> A miracle, they would call it. But you were not meant for miracles. You were the ending. The silence. The one who arrives when the story is over. Life was never yours to give. </em>
</p><p>
<em> And yet, she came to you one night with trembling hands and wide eyes and told you she was pregnant. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Your wife, Agatha. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Your son, Nicholas Scratch. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She carried him. Months of aching and nausea and laughter so bright it cracked your ribs from the inside. She glowed. She swore at you constantly. She hated the smell of herbs, cried over bees, demanded soup at midnight and wanted your hands on her belly always. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You loved her more in those months than you had ever loved anything. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The day came. His little heart, once so strong, had started to falter. You had known before she did. You had felt it. And when you told her, she looked at you like you had murdered something in her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Maybe you had. </em>
</p><p>
<em> "I told you not to come.” “Please, my love.” “If you do this,” your wife said, voice shaking, “I will hate you forever.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> You believed her.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> So you bent the rules. You gave her time with him. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Six years. </em>
</p><p>
<em> He was beautiful. You loved him. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You watched from a distance. Unseen. Unwanted. You understood. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The night came, his heart stopped. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You took him like a thief in the night and you hated what you had to do. </em>
</p><p>
<em> When you returned to your realm, where all things end, there was not silence. </em>
</p><p>
<em> A baby girl.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> She reached for the face of Death and giggled. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Purple and green. Here with a purpose. To save what could be saved. To heal what had been broken. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Sage. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Your wife had locked herself behind the Darkhold, too broken to see. Too far gone to feel the new soul that bloomed in the soil of your world. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You were never meant to create. </em>
</p><p>
<em> But she is yours. And you love her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> And for a moment, you forget what you are. You forget who you are. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was crying now. Not loudly, but enough that she hiccupped between page turns, enough that tears slipped down her cheeks unchecked.</p><p> </p><p>She kept flipping through the journal, hands unsteady. Portraits of Nicky at every age.. Sage, too. Their faces are so familiar and so different all at once.</p><p> </p><p>She had thought this kind of hurt was behind her. It wasn’t the kind of grief that dragged her under. It didn’t consume her. It carved through her, yes but cleanly. And still, she read. She needed to.</p><p> </p><p>Beside her, Rio pressed a kiss to her shoulder. “If you need to stop,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shook her head without looking up. Her fingers turned another page.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t want to stop.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>
<em> 1786: </em>

<em> You pray every day to a god who does not exist. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You’ve searched. You’ve waited. You’ve stood at every ending, and nothing has ever answered. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Still, you pray. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Not for love. Not for absolution. Just for a chance, someday, to be forgiven. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Not now. Not soon. Maybe not even in this existence. But someday. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You’ve tried to find her. She doesn’t want to be found. </em>
</p><p>
<em> She leaves bodies in her wake like twisted love notes. Marks of power, of anger, of memory. You follow them, ruins in her shape, but she’s never there. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Only silence. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You don’t expect her to look at you the way she once did. You know what you did. What you didn’t do. What you couldn’t. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You pray in the quiet, when Sage is asleep. When your realm is still. When her voice comes back- “If you do this, I will hate you forever.” </em>
</p><p>
<em> She meant it. </em>
</p><p>
<em> If she never forgives you… if she never softens, never says your name again without venom… you’ll keep praying. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Because it means you haven’t forgotten what it felt like to be hers. </em>
</p><p>
<em> And maybe, somewhere in the dark, she hasn’t forgotten what it felt like to be yours. </em>

<em> No. </em>
</p><p>
<em> It wasn’t cold. It wasn’t cruel. It was just true. The truth that lives in your bones, too deep to question. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Your daughter nodded, unbothered. Told you that if you ever changed your mind, she’d do it better anyway. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Then she wrapped her arms around you and held on so tight, you almost believed she could. </em>

</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha flipped through Rio’s journal a few more times- rereading certain entries, lingering on the ones she’d rushed past, letting herself get caught on the portraits of her children and herself through centuries.</p><p> </p><p>She finally closed it and dropped it onto the coffee table. Sniffed. Wiped at the wetness on her cheeks. “This is good,” Agatha said. “You won’t forget. That’s good.” She tried to make it sound convincing -<em>really fucking tried-</em> but even to her own ears, it fell flat.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio breathed, but there was nothing behind it.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t sound so sure.” Agatha cast a glance toward her wife.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shifted, pulling away from where she’d been curled into Agatha’s side. She turned, folding one leg beneath her as she angled her body to face her more directly.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll know these things happened. I’ll believe they happened. But it’ll be like I’m staring through glass at someone else’s life, and the longer I look, the more I wonder if I was ever really there at all.”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t know that,” Agatha said like if she said it plainly enough, the ground beneath them might hold.</p><p> </p><p>It had to be fixable. Memory loss wasn’t final. There was still time. There was magic, technology, a thousand ways to anchor a life to itself. They could get cameras, record everything, flood the walls with voices, fill the silence with reminders. She would build Rio a map back to herself if she had to. Step by step.</p><p> </p><p>But when Agatha looked at her wife, the argument caught in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t speak. Didn’t defend herself. She just sat there, still and distant, looking at Agatha like it had already happened. Not some looming fear or hypothetical loss but something real and irreversible. Something that had already slipped through her fingers.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s stomach turned, the panic crawling up her spine before she could push it down. It wasn’t just forgetting, it was absence. And worse, it was casual. A part of them, their history- reduced to a passing fucking line a journal, as if it hadn’t meant everything. As if it had been a footnote instead of the center of the goddamn world. </p><p> </p><p>The ease of it was diabolical. The way something so sacred could vanish without warning, without fanfare, and no one had even thought to mourn it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was mourning it without even fucking realizing that it was dying in the first place.</p><p> </p><p>Without thinking, Agatha reached forward, snatched the journal from the table, and pressed it hard into Rio’s hands.</p><p> </p><p>“Show me,” she demanded. “Tell me what it is, and I’ll remind you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t open it. Her fingers curled loosely around the cover, but her eyes never lifted from it.</p><p> </p><p>“Show it to me, Rio!” Agatha snapped, her voice rising.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was terrified of forgetting, Agatha was terrified of being forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>“It doesn’t matter,” Rio murmured, finally looking up. Her voice was soft. </p><p> </p><p>“Yes, it does,” Agatha shot back. “I’m real, Rio. I’m not a paragraph you get to skim past. I’m not a line in a diary that you forget how to feel.” Her hands shook as she gestured toward the journal. “So if there’s something in there you don’t recognize then tell me what the fuck it is, and I’ll tell you. I’ll say it a thousand times if I have to.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio set the journal down on the coffee table with more care than necessary,  then leaned back into the couch, exhaling through her nose like she'd already lost the argument.  She met Agatha’s gaze for only a second before looking away again, her eyes dropping to her hands as they twisted in her lap. She spun her wedding ring slowly, over and over.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached out and stilled her hand. When Rio finally looked up, there was a desperation in her eyes that didn’t match the calmness in her wife’s face. It was buried.</p><p> </p><p>“It doesn’t work like that,” Rio whispered, and even though the words were quiet, they carried too much finality. No matter how human Rio looked right now, her voice still held the echo of Death, cold and irrefutable.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. She yanked her hand back as if the touch had burned her.</p><p> </p><p>“So what am I supposed to say, then?” Agatha’s voice was raw now, stripped of anything gentle. “What do you want from me, Rio? I’m trying but you haven’t been making any goddamn sense and I’m running out of things to offer!”</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me to give It up, Agatha!” Rio's hands jerked in the air above her lap, shaking, like she was trying to shake the truth loose and throw it in Agatha's face.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha jerked back, feeling like she had just been physically struck across the face. Her breath caught in her throat, her eyes wide, unblinking. For a split second, she wasn’t sure if she’d misheard it- if maybe Rio hadn’t said it out loud, if maybe it had only lived in Agatha’s worst thoughts.</p><p> </p><p>But no. Rio had said it and now the silence left in its place felt so fucking loud.</p><p> </p><p>Across from her, her wife looked like she was reeling from her own voice. Her expression was pale, eyes flicking over Agatha’s face, then away, then back again, like she couldn’t decide whether to stand by her words or take them back. Her mouth opened as if she might try. But then her jaw locked. And when her gaze finally settled on Agatha, it held no apology. She meant it. And now Rio was bracing for impact.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt the anger rise like a slow boil, sharp and cold and entirely earned. She leaned forward, voice cutting.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck. No.”</p><p> </p><p>A final verdict.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha saw the way her wife’s eye dropped, the way her body sank back into the couch. She turned her head toward the window, jaw tight, tongue pressed into her cheek.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was so fucking angry she could barely see straight. The rage sitting behind her blue eyes wasn’t impulsive- it had been earned, brick by brick, over weeks of silence, avoidance, truth bombs, and the constant feeling that she was being kept just outside the perimeter of a conversation only Rio was a part of.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had given her space, had bitten her tongue, had played diplomat between her wife and their daughter when Sage started asking questions.</p><p> </p><p>But this?</p><p> </p><p>This is where it stopped.</p><p> </p><p>Rio thought she could drop a line like that and withdrawal from the conversation but she was dead wrong. </p><p> </p><p>They were going to sit in it now.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was done parsing silence. She was done filling in the blanks. If Rio had something to say, she was going to say all of it, right here, right now, without hiding behind vague confessions or that damn journal.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you have any idea what kind of position you’ve put me in?” Agatha’s voice cracked but with desperation she couldn’t disguise. She was tired of pretending she was fine. Tired of waiting for Rio to explain herself.</p><p> </p><p>The second the words left her mouth, Rio pushed up from the couch. She moved fast, crossing the room with arms folded tight across her chest, her usual armor. Her back was turned to Agatha and she just stood there, frozen in place, like the truth was easier to hear if she didn’t have to look at it. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t follow.</p><p> </p><p>She stayed seated, elbows on her knees, body pitched forward just enough to drive the words directly into Rio’s spine.</p><p> </p><p>“This has been going on for months- the hesitating, the cryptic bullshit, calling our daughter out to the garden every morning. And the whole time, you’ve said nothing. You’ve just let me stand in the middle of it, trying to hold everything together without even knowing what the hell I was holding.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was still facing away from her, and truthfully, Agatha didn’t mind. Maybe Rio had the right idea. Hearing the truth was easier than facing it and saying it was easier, too. Easier than meeting each other’s eyes and seeing how far they'd drifted from where they started the day.</p><p> </p><p>“You can’t stomach the idea of handing it to her, so you’re putting it on me instead and that is so unbelievably selfish. It’s fucking insulting, actually. You’re not protecting her. You’re not protecting me. You’re just stalling, waiting for someone else to say the thing you don’t have the nerve to say yourself. That’s not love, Rio. That’s handing me the fuse and asking me not to notice the match in your fucking hand.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s next words didn’t need to be shouted. The disgust in her mouth was enough, “You’re a coward.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio spun to face her. Her eyes were wide, glassy, like she hadn’t decided whether she was going to cry or scream. Her breathing was shallow, shoulders drawn up, “I am a coward,” she shouted.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face twisted. “Congratulations, my love! You figured it out. Sorry I don’t have a ribbon for you to run through.” The bitterness in her voice was forced but that didn’t make it land any softer.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her lip curl in disgust before she could stop it. She saw the effect immediately. Rio’s body sagged like the breath had been knocked out of her. Her arms dropped. Her whole posture seemed to deflate.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio said, quiet now.</p><p> </p><p>“Whatever.” It wasn’t flippant. It wasn’t careless. It was the only thing Agatha had that wouldn’t come out screaming.</p><p> </p><p>“I want more,” Rio said quietly, like the words tasted wrong in her mouth. Like she hated herself for meaning them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She just watched her wife. Waiting to hear what else Rio had the nerve to say.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t made to want,” Rio said. “Death doesn’t want. Death doesn’t need. That’s what I was put here to believe. I exist to witness the end of all things, to guide, to carry, to disappear quietly when the work is done. I didn’t reach. I didn’t hope. I didn’t even ask.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked away, leaned into the couch, and crossed her arms. Her eyes settled on that stupid fucking journal still on the coffee table. She’d heard it all before- this story dressed up like revelation. Rio claiming she wasn’t made to want, while still trying to hold onto a life she swore she didn’t need.</p><p> </p><p>“You ruined all of that. You made me greedy. You made me crave what I was never supposed to even recognize. It started small. I wanted to see you again. I wanted more time. I wanted to stay a little longer.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scoffed. <em> Greedy? </em> Good. There was a certain satisfaction in knowing she’d been the one to break Death’s carefully ordered world. But none of this was new. Not the confession. Not the regret. If it started small, it’s because Rio made it small. Easy to manage. Like everything else.</p><p> </p><p>Still, Rio chose it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned sharply, finger pointed. “You didn’t stumble into the fire, Rio. You chased its warmth. That’s on you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio ignored her and kept going. She leaned forward slightly, her brows lifted, gaze locked on Agatha. “That <em> want </em>-” she said it like a curse. “It grew legs. It learned your name. And it’s never stopped looking for you.”</p><p> </p><p>“I want more,” Rio went on and there was no shame in it now. “I want you. I want our son. I want Sage. I want the life we made together, the one we were never supposed to have, the one we built out of defiance and love and need. And I want the right to live in it without being a god standing outside her own fucking home.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt her anger falter. She wanted it. All of it. She wanted to be selfish. She wanted Rio to be selfish too, to take the life they built and hold it close like it was theirs to keep. Maybe that made her a monster. Maybe it always had. But hope and want and everything Rio was saying began to feel louder than the cost. And that terrified her. Because the cost had a face. The cost had a name. And still, Agatha wanted.</p><p> </p><p>“The balance doesn’t give a shit about me. It forgets my name like I’m not the reason it exists in the first place. It makes me stand in a doorway and watch the people I love walk through it without me. And when they’re gone, it leaves me here- alone, rotting, trying to remember what it felt like to belong to any of it.”</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing noble in what Rio carried. No divine purpose. Just expectation. Just survival. The balance used her, forgot her, and left her behind. Agatha had told herself it was necessary. That Rio could bear it. That someone had to. </p><p> </p><p>That was the lie Agatha told herself to sleep at night, the story that let her believe silence was mercy and distance was protection. In reality, it had been easier to let Rio suffer than to admit she didn’t know how to save her. Easier to pretend endurance was its own kind of peace.</p><p> </p><p>But there was someone to save her. To save both of them.</p><p> </p><p>Sage, reckless and relentless and sure in the way only their daughter could be. She wasn’t supposed to be part of this story. She wasn’t supposed to exist. And yet, here she was, offering a way out. Offering a life that shouldn’t exist.</p><p> </p><p>Would the balance be as cruel to Sage as it had been to Rio? Would it forget her, discard her, strip her down until she was nothing but function and sacrifice? Would it leave her alone in the doorway too, watching everything she loved slip out of reach?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have an answer, not one that would make it easier. But she had want, and that had always been enough to move her. If the price was too high, she'd pay it. If it had to fall on someone else, she'd find a way to live with that too. Maybe that was the part no one ever understood- she had never needed permission to want more. Only a reason. And now she had one.</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t trying to manipulate you. That’s not what this is. I just… I thought maybe if you wanted it too, if you asked me, then it wouldn’t feel so much like I was failing her. Or you.” She kept her eyes on Agatha, “I’m scared you’ll hate me for this. For wanting to give it to her.  That you’ll never forgive me for wanting to hand her the same burden that not even I can survive. But I’m still standing here. Saying it. Because I do want it. I want to be done.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed hard, “I just didn’t want to be done without you.”</p><p> </p><p>It took everything in Agatha not to recoil from what her wife’s words meant- what they demanded her to feel. The terrifying, humiliating truth was that she hadn’t been ready to hear them. Somehow, after everything, she still hadn’t prepared herself for the sound of fear in Rio’s voice. Of being seen by Agatha and no longer being enough. Of becoming something too far gone to be forgiven… Again.</p><p> </p><p>If it had been manipulation, Agatha could have handled that. She could have weaponized it, twisted it into an argument, wrapped it in blame and used it to keep the space between them intact. She knew how to live with cruelty. She knew how to survive necessity. But this wasn’t either. It was honesty, unguarded and unpolished, laid at her feet.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood in front of her, voice unsteady, hands open, eyes locked onto hers like she didn’t trust herself to look anywhere else. Agatha saw it. All of it. How tired Rio was, how much she had already given, how close she was to walking away from all of it. And still, she stood there, hoping Agatha might see her. Not Death. Not a failure. Just herself.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did.</p><p> </p><p>But she didn’t see a victim. She didn’t see someone broken by the world. She saw someone who had survived it the same way she had-  by becoming what the world thought of her.</p><p> </p><p>They had both made the same kind of choices. Both justified the damage. Both called it love. And maybe it was. Maybe it still is.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted to turn away, to pretend she didn’t care. But she couldn’t. She couldn’t lie to herself, not here. Not with Rio still standing in front of her, still asking to be seen.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had always seen her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment. Then she tilted her head, eyes narrowing. “Well,” she said, her voice dry, “you certainly know how to make a girl feel special.” She stood from the couch and made her way over to where Rio was still standing, looking at her with worried eyes. She stopped in front of her, arms crossed.</p><p> </p><p>“I won’t hate you,” Agatha said quietly. </p><p> </p><p>She saw the relief hit Rio like a bus, felt it in the way her wife stepped forward and reached for her belt, pulling her in. Agatha let her. She didn’t move away. But when Rio leaned in to kiss her, Agatha stopped her with a hand pressed firmly to her chest.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not going to ask you to do it,” Agatha said. “And it won’t be because I said you could.”</p><p> </p><p>Her hand didn’t waver.</p><p> </p><p>“She deserves to know who made the choice. And why. I won’t carry that for you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded- barely. Once. “I know,” She said softly.</p><p> </p><p>They stood like that for a moment, just staring at each other. Agatha’s hand rested against Rio’s chest. Rio’s fingers still hooked in the belt at Agatha’s waist.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio whispered, “Am I a terrible mother?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed. She moved her hands up to cradle Rio’s face. Her wife looked at her with those big, sad brown eyes.</p><p> </p><p>When a single tear slid down, Agatha caught it with her thumb.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” she said. Immediate. Certain. “I don’t want to hear you ask that again.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could have stood there listing every reason why Rio wasn’t a terrible mother. She could have talked about the sacrifices, the endless years of holding it all together, the way she showed up for a child that shouldn’t have existed in the first place. She could have said all the right things in all the right ways.</p><p> </p><p> Rio didn’t need any of that.</p><p> </p><p>What she needed was someone to meet her where she was, to hear the question and still choose to stay. She needed to know that even now, even at her worst, she wasn’t alone in it.</p><p> </p><p>So Agatha didn’t explain. She didn’t try to make it easier.</p><p> </p><p>“Can we talk about something else now?” Rio asked. It came out like a plea.</p><p> </p><p>“Like what?” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“I don’t care,” Rio said. “Anything but this. I’m tired.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was tired too. Tired in a way that settled into her bones and didn’t leave. She was more than willing to let the weight of the day sit untouched for now. They all needed a break from the truth, from the future.</p><p> </p><p>She nodded. “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t know how long they’d been on the couch. Hours, maybe. The television hummed in the background, but she wasn’t watching. Not really. There were no mentions of Death, no questions about the future. It was just this- Rio curled up beside her, the room quiet except for the low murmur of some nature documentary.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha could almost pretend it was always like this. If she squinted and let herself fall deep enough into the comfort, she could taste it.  An afterlife not painted in duty or blood or sacrifice. A life that wasn’t defined by what they owed the universe or what the universe kept stealing in return. Watered plants, mismatched mugs left in the sink, Sunday mornings where the most pressing decision was whether to go back to bed after breakfast.</p><p> </p><p>She could almost believe in that world. One where Rio wasn’t holding everything together with aching hands. Where Sage didn’t look at them like she knew too much. Where Agatha wasn't a ghost clinging to her own second chance.</p><p> </p><p>If she stayed still enough, she could almost see him. Nicky. Barefoot and loud, darting through the hallway like he'd never known anything but joy. His laughter echoing off the walls, sticky fingers tugging at her sleeve, asking for one more story before bed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha blinked, and he was gone again.</p><p> </p><p>But for a moment, it felt like he’d been there, like this version of their life could’ve made space for him too.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes landed on Rio’s journal, still sitting on the coffee table. She knew Rio had forgotten something but she hadn’t said what.</p><p> </p><p>That part gnawed at her.</p><p> </p><p>She turned her head to ask, but the words never made it out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was already watching her because of course she was. Always one step ahead, always tuned in to whatever frequency Agatha was too proud to admit she was broadcasting. Her wife’s eyes were dark with something that had nothing to do with sorrow or grief.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt it then. A warmth blooming low in her belly, curling like fire without pain. It stole her breath, not with urgency, but with promise. Like the flower she had read about. The one that only blooms after a fire, rare and defiant, rising from ash because it knows nothing else could’ve made it grow.</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, she wasn’t thinking about the journal anymore. She was thinking about Rio’s hands, their touch, the promise of more. About the way Rio looked at her like it was the very first time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio would still the ocean for Agatha Harkness- had done it before, without her asking. Would do it again if Agatha so much as looked like she might need the waves to stop.</p><p> </p><p>And she would follow Rio into the dark without a light, if it meant holding on to this. To being wanted by someone who had held the tides in her palms and still thought Agatha was the greater force.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rose from the couch without a word and reached out her hand. Agatha took it. She let her wife lead her through the house, each step dignified like it belonged to another life entirely. A life where they hadn’t spent centuries circling each other, breaking and rebuilding, trying to remember how to be soft.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like moving through a dream. The flicker of the television behind them, the narrow staircase they passed, a nearly invisible drawing near the baseboard- four stick figures beneath a crooked sun. One offering a flower. Two smaller ones between them. Agatha hadn’t noticed it before. Her fingers curled tighter in Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>It all faded as Rio guided her down the hall. </p><p> </p><p>Their bedroom door was already open, as if it, too, had been waiting.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped at the edge of the bed and turned, still holding her hand, her thumb brushing over Agatha’s knuckles like she was making sure this was real. Then she gave a gentle tug. A silent request.</p><p> </p><p>And like any good disciple, Agatha obeyed. She sat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood in front of her. For a moment, she didn’t move. She only looked at Agatha like she was reading something written just beneath her skin. Then, without a word, she reached for the button of her jeans and unfastened it. The zipper came next, unspooling like a secret.</p><p> </p><p>Her fingers slid into the waistband and eased the denim down her legs. She never broke eye contact. Those brown eyes stayed locked on Agatha’s. When the jeans reached the floor, she swept them aside with her foot.</p><p> </p><p>There was nothing underneath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. Her mouth went dry and then somehow flooded all at once. It wasn’t just desire. It was hunger that had never once faded.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled her shirt over her head and let it fall to the floor. No bra, not that Agatha expected one. Her wife hardly ever wore one. Still, the sight made Agatha feel like she’d forgotten how to breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt almost stupid for how badly she wanted. Like some animal on its knees, begging at the altar of what had always been hers.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio was standing in front of her, stripped bare, and somehow that was more powerful than Death had ever been. There was no crown, no silence that swallowed the room, no sense of something ancient. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha had killed Death. Made her feel. Made her want something she was never supposed to. She hadn’t done it with force, not with spells or defiance, but with love that crept in slow and quiet and stayed.</p><p> </p><p>Death was gone. All that was left was a woman who had once held the end of the world in her hands with nothing left to hide behind. </p><p> </p><p><em>And that</em>, Agatha thought, <em>felt far more dangerous. Far more holy.</em></p><p> </p><p>She felt the smile tug at her lips, “Kneel.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio fell to her knees like she’d been waiting to. Like it was the only place in the entire universe she knew how to be.</p><p> </p><p>This was power that didn’t need to be taken. It was given, And it was hers. It was the most staggering form of devotion Agatha had ever seen.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached out and slid her hands up Agatha’s thighs, her thumbs kneading into the inside. Agatha felt the pressure, the heat, the way Rio touched her like she had a thousand times before and still meant every second of it. Then her wife leaned in and rested her head against Agatha’s knees. Her hands moved slightly, settling on the outside of her thighs, holding Agatha there just enough to say she wasn’t letting go.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha brought a hand to her hair, fingers slipping through the strands without thinking. Rio sucked in a breath at the contact.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tugged gently at Rio’s hair just to see her. To see her face. Rio lifted her head without protest, and Agatha met her gaze. She reached out, cupped her wife’s cheek, and ran her thumb along her bottom lip.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked like she would fly into the sun if Agatha asked her to. Not like Icarus, foolish and doomed, but willing. Eager even.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her hands fall back into her lap. Rio’s breath stuttered out of her, and she reached for Agatha’s belt, fingers working carefully at the buckle. She pulled the leather free from its loops then looked up again.</p><p> </p><p>Those brown eyes were wide, unsure. And Agatha felt a flicker of nostalgia. The first time. When they hadn’t known how to be careful, tearing, like punishment and prayer at once. She’d been the first to touch Rio. The first Rio had touched. Agatha remembered how her hands had shaken- not out of fear, but want. Too much of it. Like Death hadn’t known how to hold something without breaking it. That same tremble was there now. Softer. Still hers.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked down again and reached for the buttons on her shirt. Her fingers fumbled the first one, then the second. Agatha didn’t move. Didn’t help. She just watched the woman who had once torn through her now take her apart one button at a time.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her. Let her wife take her time. Let her want her without the panic, without the urgency. Not like before, when everything between them had burned too fast to hold.</p><p> </p><p>Once the last button was undone, Rio slipped the shirt from where it had been tucked into Agatha’s pants. Her hands moved to Agatha’s shoulders, pushing the fabric down her arms and letting it fall to the bed.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had worn the green set that day. Thank fuck she did.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat back on her heels and just stared, eyes dragging over every inch of her. Agatha watched her, amused, aroused, entirely aware of the effect she was having on her wife. She reached one arm behind herself to unhook the clasp- </p><p> </p><p>But Rio moved. Quick, desperate, catching her wrist before she could.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me,” she whispered, her mouth brushing Agatha’s cheek. “Please.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt a shiver run down her spine. She turned her head toward the heat of Rio’s breath, and from this angle, had to glance down to meet her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay,” she breathed, and let her hand fall.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached behind her and unhooked Agatha’s bra, slipping the straps from her shoulders and letting it fall somewhere neither of them cared about. Her hand came up next, threading through Agatha’s hair, tilting her head to the side and baring her neck.</p><p> </p><p>Then her mouth found the spot just beneath Agatha’s ear.</p><p> </p><p>The moment she felt lips against her skin, open and warm, Agatha shivered. Goosebumps rolled across her body, and her hand shot to the back of Rio’s head. She moaned, loud and unrestrained.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed down her neck at a slow, agonizing pace. Every inch she traveled made Agatha ache. Her center throbbed. Her whole body pulsed with it.</p><p> </p><p>She tugged on Rio’s hair, pulled her up, and crushed their mouths together.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her wife like she was starving. Like Rio had something inside her she needed to survive.</p><p> </p><p>Rio opened her mouth instantly welcoming Agatha in, eager, willing, ready to give her everything.</p><p> </p><p>The angle was off, Agatha sitting on the edge of the bed and Rio still kneeling in front of her. But the difference in height only made Agatha kiss her deeper, made her take more.</p><p> </p><p>After Agatha had tasted every inch of Rio’s mouth, leaving no part of it untouched by her tongue, she swallowed a moan from her wife. It was loud, desperate, deep in her throat before pulling her down and guiding her to her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t pause. She took Agatha’s nipple into her mouth, licking in slow circles before tugging at it with her teeth. Agatha moaned, head falling back slightly, and Rio moaned louder in response, the sound vibrating against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>Then her wife moved to the other breast, her mouth just as hungry, just as focused. She sucked, licked, bit, until Agatha was breathing hard through her teeth, one hand tangled in Rio’s hair. She felt Rio’s fingers working clumsily at the button of her pants.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled away, only to focus. Her hands made quick work of the button and zipper, and Agatha leaned back on one hand to give her space, canting her hips up in offering. Her own breath was wrecked now, shallow and messy in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hooked her fingers into the waistband, catching both the slacks and underwear in one motion.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha let her take them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moved to her chest again, her mouth dragging slow, open mouthed kisses down Agatha’s skin. Agatha stayed leaned on one hand, eyes fluttering as she tried to keep them open. The lower Rio went, the harder it became to focus on anything but the heat building inside her.</p><p> </p><p>But then she felt her wife shift, her breath brushing lower, and Agatha shot up with a sharp inhale. “Wait,” she said, voice tight.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up at her, startled.</p><p> </p><p>“Wait,” Agatha repeated, softer this time.</p><p> </p><p>She reached out, her palm brushing along Rio’s jaw. “Let me… Let me feel you first.” Agatha needed to. She needed to feel how badly Rio wanted her before she gave her everything.</p><p> </p><p>Rio leaned back slightly, still on her knees, and opened her legs without a word. Agatha moved forward, resting her head on Rio’s shoulder, her hand already between them.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha cupped her wife fully.</p><p> </p><p>Both of them moaned so deep and loud it knocked the air from their lungs. Rio was soaked. Not just slick, but dripping. Agatha felt it on her fingers, on her palm, along the insides of her  wife's thighs. </p><p> </p><p>She pulled her hand back, and Rio whimpered like it hurt.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha leaned back, resting on one hand again, and brought her other to her mouth. She slid her fingers between her lips and sucked them clean, eyes fluttering shut at the taste of Rio. She moaned around them, loud and shameless.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha-” Her name came out of Rio’s mouth like a prayer choked on a sob, torn straight from her chest.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha opened her eyes again, Rio was staring at her like she hadn’t eaten in centuries and Agatha was the only thing left in the world worth tasting.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked her wife up and down, her breath still uneven, her body aching with how badly she wanted more. She let a smirk curl at her mouth and let her now clean hand fall to the bed.</p><p> </p><p>She gave Rio a single nod.</p><p> </p><p>“All yours, my love.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t go easy on her.</p><p> </p><p>Not in the sense of rushing. She didn’t dive straight to where Agatha was already aching. No- she took her time. Her mouth pressed to the inside of one thigh, then the other, licking slow, open mouthed trails up soft skin made slick with sweat and need. She kissed every inch of her, every place except where Agatha was silently begging for it. Even the soft press of her lips to Agatha’s mound made her whimper, made her hips roll forward in search of more.</p><p> </p><p>She let herself fall back against the bed, breathing sharp through her nose as Rio’s hands gripped her thighs and pulled her closer to the edge of the bed. Her legs were spread, one brought up and over Rio’s shoulder, the other pushed open with a firm hand.</p><p> </p><p>And finally, finally, Rio dragged her tongue up the full length of her in one long, deliberate stroke.</p><p> </p><p>Rio moaned. Loud.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hand flew to the back of her wife’s head, fingers digging into her hair. The vibration of Rio’s moan against her sent a jolt straight through her spine. She cried out, hips jerking, her body couldn’t take the shock of it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t stop. Her tongue circled her clit, soft at first, then firmer until Agatha was gasping, thighs shaking with every slow roll of pressure. She licked, sucked, kissed her like it meant something, like it was worship.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed, breathless and wrecked. “How do I taste?” she stuttered out, barely able to get the words past the tightness in her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to speak, lips still brushing against her.</p><p> </p><p>“Like a fucking god.”</p><p> </p><p>Then her mouth was on Agatha again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s tongue didn’t stop moving, didn’t slow, didn’t falter. She licked Agatha like she was devouring her. Long, slow strokes that turned sharp when she flicked her tongue over her clit, then back down again, soft and wet and overwhelming. She kissed her between each stroke, open mouthed and hungry, like she wanted to leave a mark, like she wanted Agatha to feel her for days.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hips bucked. She was so close and Rio knew it.</p><p> </p><p>Then she felt it. Two fingers sliding into her, deep and sure.</p><p> </p><p>The moan that tore through Agatha was guttural, her back arching off the bed. Rio curled them just right, fingers pressing into the spot that made Agatha see stars, while her mouth stayed locked around her clit.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s heel dug into Rio’s back and her wife fucked her with the same focus she brought to everything else. Thorough. Intentional. Tongue and fingers working in tandem, pulling every sound Agatha had ever been capable of making from her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t think. Could barely breathe.</p><p> </p><p>Each moan from Rio sent vibrations through her and it made her grip the sheets with one hand while the other stayed tangled in her wife’s hair.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha lifted her head with what little strength she had left, needing to see it, to take it in.</p><p> </p><p>And there she was- Rio, buried between her legs, eyes closed like she was lost in prayer, moaning against her, unable to get enough.  She looked holy like that. Beautiful in a way Agatha didn’t have words for.</p><p> </p><p>That was all it took.</p><p> </p><p>The sight of her wife, the sound of her moaning into Agatha, the feeling of everything tightening and pulling and burning all at once.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha came hard. </p><p> </p><p>Her head fell back into the bed, eyes rolling up as she clenched tight around Rio’s fingers.</p><p> </p><p>She cried out Rio’s name. It tore through her. And Agatha gave it to her. All of it. Every sound, every pulse, every prayer Rio had ever sent to her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tugged on Rio’s hair and Rio obeyed. Her wife pulled away with a kiss to the inside of her thigh, then climbed the length of her body. She kissed Agatha, slow and open and deep, and she fucked her again like there was nothing else in the world she was meant to be doing.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha came again, the words slipped from her lips in a desperate whine.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had gasped it back. The words tore from her as if they were the first breath of air she'd every truly been allowed.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t stop after that. Not for a while. They kept touching, kept fucking, kept reaching for each other like they were trying to make up for all the time lost between lives. It was messy and perfect and loud. And none of it felt like an ending.</p><p> </p><p>It felt like the beginning of something they hadn’t touched yet. Like the first breath after surfacing. Like there was a world waiting for them past all this- one without blood, without duty, without the silence that had kept them apart for so long.</p><p> </p><p>A life beyond Death.</p><p> </p><p>One where they would finally be allowed to know peace.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The month slipped through their fingers like dusk through a windowpane- quiet, golden, and gone before they could hold it. It was a season of love and learning, of unspoken things finally said and the slow work of letting go.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat Sage down one evening while Agatha watched from the armchair, a witness to what felt like history turning its face. She told their daughter everything- how she wanted to accept the offer, how she was ready to step away from Death, how the silence she’d kept around it had been a form of fear, not strength. She cried as she said it, not out of regret, but release. And Sage, stunned into stillness, had only whispered: “I promise I’ll make you proud.”</p><p> </p><p>They worried. Of course they did. They were her mothers.</p><p> </p><p>One night, Rio woke Agatha with trembling hands and whispered dread. What if Sage couldn’t visit the afterlife once she became Death? What if she was locked out of it, lost to them in a way no magic could undo? Agatha, still half asleep, still utterly sure, gathered her close and answered it as fact. “Where there’s Sage, there’s a way.” Agatha said her soul wouldn’t dare move on without knowing their daughter could find them again. Agatha would wait. They’d figure it out together.</p><p> </p><p>She held Rio until sleep returned. Until the worry dulled, and her wife's world became safe again.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio spent her days teaching Sage, pouring centuries of knowledge into their time together like water into cupped hands. Some of it stuck. Some of it slipped through. One afternoon, after hours of careful instruction, Sage made a reckless comment. It was too flippant, too sure of herself, and Rio had snapped.  She told their daughter this wasn’t just happening to her. It wasn’t a gift, or a blessing, or anything close to mercy. It was a sentence. A burden dressed as a power. She told her to grow up and see it as such.</p><p> </p><p>But Sage, ever unshaken, didn’t see the cost as a deterrent. She saw it as a path. For her, the eternity waiting on the other side of this exchange meant nothing if it could stitch her family back together.</p><p> </p><p>That night, Agatha told Rio what she thought- Sage wasn’t ready.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio agreed. But she also believed in something bigger. That Sage wouldn’t inherit the role unchanged. That she wouldn’t bend to its brutal cycle or lose herself to the repetition.</p><p> </p><p>The balance would simply bend to her power.</p><p> </p><p>It was a fragile kind of faith, it questioned more than it promised. But they held on to it anyway. It was all they had. </p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept teaching. Day after day, she poured herself into the effort, and eventually, she brought Sage out on a job. Agatha waited, restless until they returned. When they did, Sage looked untouched. Her spirit unchanged. Whatever she had witnessed out there had left no visible mark. Her eyes were still green. Her voice still carried that same easy confidence. </p><p> </p><p>The sun in the realm had refused to dim.</p><p> </p><p>It unsettled Agatha more than she expected.</p><p> </p><p>Later, she asked Rio about it. Not accusing, just curious. Was it a front? A defense? Something Sage was doing to keep them both from worrying?</p><p> </p><p>But Rio shook her head.</p><p> </p><p>She said Sage hadn’t flinched. Hadn’t wavered. She had stepped into that threshold the way she had first walked onto the surface- without fear, without hesitation. As if she had always been meant to stand in the middle of it, untouched by the gravity of what surrounded her.</p><p> </p><p>And then Rio said it had made her sick.</p><p> </p><p>The words weren’t cruel. Just honest.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>On another day, Agatha took Sage aside. It was her turn to teach. She walked her through the way she had learned to control her siphoning- how to temper it, how to hold it back before it could take control. Her voice was practiced, but her thoughts kept drifting.</p><p> </p><p>She told Sage to close her eyes. To find something that grounded her. Something that could pull her back when the power would start to blur the edges of her will.</p><p> </p><p>They didn’t have a witch to siphon from, no real way to replicate the euphoria of it. But that wasn’t the point. Agatha needed her to understand it before it ever happened again.</p><p> </p><p>What Agatha couldn’t say, is that she was scared she might never get the chance to explain it again. That time, even here, wasn’t promised. She held that truth close, only ever admitted the fear into a mirror and nowhere else.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio had said it like a joke, tossed the words at Sage with a theatrical groan, begging her not to let the garden go to shit. Her wife said it with a grin, but Agatha heard the plea in her voice. The garden had never been just a hobby to her wife. Unlike the balance, every stem bent toward Rio and remembered her name. It was the one place that never forgot her, never demanded more than what she gave.  She loved it fiercely, tended it with such adoration that it made even the wild things behave.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t laugh. She nodded, serious in that way that she rarely ever was. Their daughter would never let it fall apart. Agatha knew that. She also knew the lilies might not love Sage the way they had loved Rio, might not open as easily beneath her hands. But Sage would still talk to them. Every morning. Every night. She’d show up, even if the roots ignored her. Because it was Rio’s. And that was reason enough.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio chose a Wednesday. No fanfare. No final lesson. </p><p> </p><p>Her wife didn’t say it out loud, not at first. Instead of disappearing into the garden like she always did, she stayed close. She sat beside Agatha on the patio instead, barefoot, hair still damp, stealing sips from Agatha’s coffee.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio looked at her, there was so much love in it, so much certainty, that Agatha could barely breathe. She swore it felt like Rio had reached a hand straight down her throat, torn her heart up and out from her mouth, and whispered ‘<em> this is mine now, I’ll protect it forever.’ </em></p><p> </p><p>And then Rio kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>Not like it was the last. Not like she was saying goodbye. But like she was finally free to mean it.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat a distance away, knees pulled tight to her chest, fingers curled into the fabric of her pants. The ground beneath her was damp from dew, but she didn’t move. She barely blinked. Her eyes stayed fixed on the willow, where Rio stood with Sage, not far from stone memorial that held their son’s name.</p><p> </p><p>She could see Rio explaining it.  How it would happen. What it would mean. How Sage would take in Rio’s powers. Of course it would come down to siphoning. That was the power Agatha passed on, wasn’t it? The one that had siphoned Rio’s power before, turned Agatha into a ghost. And now it was Sage’s. The cycle, still spinning.</p><p> </p><p>Go fucking figure.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha couldn’t make out every word. The distance blurred the language, but not the voices. She knew their cadence, the rise and fall of them. Rio’s calm, patient, sure even when she wasn’t. Sage’s quieter than usual.</p><p> </p><p>Then both of them looked at Agatha. At once. Like they had rehearsed it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha startled slightly, caught in their gaze. And before she could speak, before she could rise or ready herself, Rio was already heading toward her. Fast. Not running, but just barely keeping herself from it.</p><p> </p><p>Her wife had stopped only when she was close enough to reach. Her hands found Agatha’s shirt- fisted the fabric and yanked her upright.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>It far too much for them, especially with Sage not thirty feet away. But Agatha didn’t care. She kissed her wife back because it mattered. It had always mattered.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally pulled away, breath gone and heart somewhere in her throat, she let her forehead rest against Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>A single tear fell. Not from Rio, but from her.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t be too long, my love,” Rio whispered, wiping the tear from Agatha’s cheek with a gentleness that nearly broke her. “I’ll spend every day haunting you otherwise.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha huffed a soft laugh.</p><p> </p><p>“Hate to break it to you,” she said, glancing toward the willow and back again, “but you’re kind of stuck with me. Until... well, forever.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled like it was the only truth worth hearing. “I wouldn’t fucking dream of anything else.”</p><p> </p><p>Her wife kissed her again, softer this time. Something closer to PG, if only barely. Agatha let her have it, then lightly pushed her back.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“I love you more.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t have it in her to argue.</p><p> </p><p>She returned to her place on the ground, her hands folding neatly over her knees. When she looked up, she found Sage watching her- not with embarrassment or awkward discomfort like Agatha expected, but with a knowing smile.</p><p> </p><p>It was peace.</p><p> </p><p>Like, for the first time, their daughter could finally give them a story worth telling. One that ended in something that looked a lot like happiness.</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked back to Sage and pulled her into a hug. Agatha couldn’t hear the words, only saw the way their daughter buried her face in Rio’s shoulder, eyes closed, nodding slowly to whatever was being said.</p><p> </p><p>Trust clinging to its source.</p><p> </p><p>Then Rio turned them around. Her wife’s back now faced Agatha. </p><p> </p><p>Rio was shielding Agatha. Sparing her. Or trying to.</p><p> </p><p>It was immediate, visceral. Pain ripped through their daughter’s voice, utterly and completely raw, and with each cry came words Agatha never wanted to hear like that again.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom- it hurts.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha slammed her hands over her ears. Shut her eyes so tightly they burned. Her whole body locked in place, caught in the impossible war between instinct and understanding. Every part of her wanted to run forward, to pull her daughter away from what hurt.</p><p> </p><p>She was a mother. She wasn’t built to listen to her daughter suffer and sit still.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had warned her. That it might hurt. That Agatha might not want to see it. Agatha, too proud for her own good, had scoffed. Said she could handle it.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe she should have listened to her wife.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s okay, Petal. I’m here. You’re not alone.” Her wife was holding Sage through it. Bearing the pain alongside her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t open her eyes until the screaming stopped.</p><p> </p><p>What she saw made no sense. Not magically. Not emotionally. Not in any way that comforted.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was floating.</p><p> </p><p>Not hovering gracefully, not glowing, not bathed in light like a scene from a storybook. Her arms hung slightly out, her fingers loose, her head tipped back, hair cascading in all directions. The air around her shimmered like reality was bending to make room. It was holy, yes. But wrong, too. Too strange to be safe. Sacred in a way Agatha didn’t know how to comprehend. Sacred in the way of doorways, and blood, and things you never get back.</p><p> </p><p>Rio knelt below her, one hand pressed to the ground, the other hanging at her side, limp. Her face tilted upward, but all Agatha could see was the back of her wife’s head.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had only blinked.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was gone.</p><p> </p><p>Where her wife had been kneeling only a second before, there was a grave- fresh and buried beneath an impossible flood of flowers.</p><p> </p><p>The earth, in recognizing its Original Green Witch was gone, wept in bloom for the hands that had once taught it how to grow.</p><p> </p><p>Sage was still fucking floating. Still suspended in that terrible grace and then she wasn’t.</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter’s body dropped.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t gentle. One moment Sage hung in the air like she belonged to something higher, and the next, she was plummeting toward the earth at a speed Agatha couldn’t even process. She shouted her daughter’s name, but the sound barely caught up before Sage hit the ground with an such impact that it shook beneath Agatha’s feet. </p><p> </p><p>She landed just feet from Rio’s grave.</p><p> </p><p>For the second time, Agatha looked upon that impossible mound of flowers, and it wasn’t her breath that left her. It was a feeling deep inside her ribcage that wrenched forward like it had recognized what had been taken. Not grief. Not shock. But a pulling. A summoning. Existential and precise, as if someone had placed a hand on her spine and asked her to take one last look.</p><p> </p><p>And then-</p><p> </p><p>“Mama!”</p><p> </p><p>His voice struck like lightning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha whipped around. “Nicky!” she cried, instinctively.  But there was no one there. Just the sound echoing through the air. She turned back, eyes wide, and saw Sage stumbling up from the ground, legs shaking beneath her, tripping as she tried to run. Not away.</p><p> </p><p>Toward Agatha.</p><p> </p><p><em> Fuck </em>.</p><p> </p><p>They’d misunderstood everything.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t her connection to Sage that had kept her here- not the bond, not the unfinished love between mother and daughter. That had been a comfort. A tether, maybe. But not the anchor.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha felt it now with terrifying clarity, the way her soul rattled inside this temporary body, no longer content to pretend it belonged to the living. It was spiritual.</p><p> </p><p>It was Rio. It had always been Rio.</p><p> </p><p>Her unfinished business was Rio fucking Vidal.</p><p> </p><p>The oblivion hadn’t taken her because it couldn’t. As long as Rio had been trapped in her duty, Agatha had been trapped too.</p><p> </p><p>It was love so absolute that it rewrote the laws of what was allowed to move on. </p><p> </p><p>Peace hadn’t been possible.</p><p> </p><p>Not until now.</p><p> </p><p>The last thing Agatha saw was Sage barreling toward her, eyes wide with panic, hand outstretched like she could stop it. Like she could reach her mother in time.</p><p> </p><p>The last thing she heard was her daughter screaming- </p><p> </p><p>“MOM!”</p><p> </p><p>And then, like all tragedies written by gods and witnessed by no one, the curtains fell. The lights died.</p><p> </p><p>The world went dark.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Sage hit the ground hard for a second time. This time, she rolled, landing on her hands and knees, the breath knocked clean from her lungs. Her fingers dug into the wet grass, frantic, like she could dig her mother out from beneath it if she just tried hard enough.</p><p> </p><p>The clawing turned to fists. Fury came. She struck the earth with both hands, again and again, until a guttural scream tore free from her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Thunder cracked. Lightning tore the sky open. And the rain came down in sheets. </p><p> </p><p>She leaned back on her calves, breath catching in her throat, rain sputtering from her lips with every heavy breath. She stared at the space where her mother had just been standing. Then she turned, squinting through the downpour toward the other’s grave. The earth had made it special. Final.</p><p> </p><p>She swallowed hard and looked up at the sky, the only thing left that still knew her name, the only thing still listening.</p><p> </p><p>“I’ll clean it up,” Sage said. Her voice broke. “I swear I’ll clean it up…”</p><p> </p><p>She had to. She fucking better.</p><p> </p><p>Because for the first time in her life, Sage Vidal-Harkness was truly alone. Not lost, not abandoned- just alone. Left in the aftermath of choices she had made, sitting in the center of the storm that her emotions had summoned. This was what she asked for. This was what she built with her own hands. And now, there was no one left to save her from it.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>If Agatha Harkness were still around, she would tell you that she used to hate fall.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it’s because she finally learned that fall isn’t about endings. It’s about returning, like every other fucking season is. About letting go of what can’t be carried into winter. It’s about the world shedding its leaves so something else can grow.</p><p> </p><p>She’d tell you that fall taught her what she never let herself believe in life- that leaving is not always a failure. That surrender can be sacred. That sometimes the most powerful thing you can do is stop holding on.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe she’d laugh and say the season was never the problem.</p><p> </p><p>Because she would know that fall doesn’t wither to disappear. It withers to make room.</p><p> </p><p>But if Agatha Harkness were still around to tell you the truth, she’d admit she doesn’t hate it so much anymore.</p>

<p>"I can hear you thinking from here.”</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Rio was stretched out on her stomach, chin resting on her folded arms, parked squarely between her wife’s legs. The view in front of her was… obstructed. Soft. Unreasonably distracting.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>“Then plug your ears.” Rio mumbles. </p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Agatha sighs. “What’s wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>“Nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>Her wife sighs louder this time. Rio hears the book she was reading slam shut and feels the light thunk as it’s tossed beside her.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio.” Agatha’s voice is stern now. A warning to spit it out.</p><p> </p><p>Rio purses her lips, lifting just enough to peek over the curve blocking her view.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha is staring down at her, arms crossed, one brow raised.</p><p> </p><p>Rio immediately drops back down, retreating behind what she now considers very effective cover. </p><p> </p><p>Her wife had been a little terrifying lately. Rio figures pregnancy’ll do that to a person.</p><p> </p><p>“I was just admiring the architectural marvel that is your stomach.”</p><p> </p><p>“Try again.” Agatha says flatly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio groaned and let her head drop into her arms. Then, without a word, she slides off the bed, rounds it, and gently helps Agatha sit up.</p><p> </p><p>She climbed back onto the bed slowly, knees framing her wife’s hips as she settled behind her. Her hands came to rest on Agatha’s thighs- close, but not where her thoughts were stuck. Not where they kept drifting. She leaned forward, pressed her mouth to Agatha’s shoulder, and stayed there a moment. Just long enough to pull herself back together.</p><p> </p><p>“Talk to me, love,” Agatha murmurs.</p><p> </p><p>Then, Agatha reached down, found Rio’s hands, and placed them over the warm curve of her belly. Her shirt had already been pushed up- had been all morning.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha always wanted Rio’s hands on her belly. Always. Even in her sleep, her wife would go searching, dragging Rio’s palms back like it wasn’t optional. Like the baby might notice if Rio wasn’t there.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe he would. Rio hoped he would.</p><p> </p><p>“What if he doesn’t like me?” Rio mumbled into Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed. She turned her slightly, just enough to glance back at Rio.  “You’re serious? That’s what all this is about?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her head, scowling. “It’s a valid question.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t argue. She just gave Rio’s hands a gentle squeeze where they rested over her belly. “He’s going to love you,” she said. “You’re dramatic and weird and talk to plants like they’re people… You’ll be his favorite person. Easily.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio made a quiet grunt, not quite agreeing with her wife. She kept her hands where they were, gently rubbing, her chest a little too tight to be fully comforted. “I don’t know,” she muttered. “I just always thought I’d be a girl mom.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a face. “Oh no. Absolutely not. I was not built for that.”</p><p> </p><p>She leaned her head back slightly to rest it on Rio’s shoulder. “Can you imagine the estrogen? The mood swings? The door slamming? It would’ve been a hormone hotbox in here.” She gave Rio’s hands another squeeze. “I barely survived my own teenage years. There’s no universe where I’m equipped to raise a mini me with opinions and lip gloss.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed, quietly, into her shoulder.</p><p> </p><p>“Do you even remember your teenage years?” Rio asked her wife very carefully.</p><p> </p><p>Rio held her breath. She already knew how Agatha felt about questions like that one, but knowing never stopped her from asking.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said without missing a beat. “But I know my mother was a heinous cunt. That much stuck.”</p><p> </p><p>“And that doesn’t strike you as... unusal?” Rio asked, still poking at her very hormonal, very beautiful bear.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squeezed Rio’s hands a little too hard, nails digging into the soft webs between her fingers. An expected response to the question Rio probably should’ve kept to herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Ow! Quit,” Rio hissed, leaning in to nip at her wife’s shoulder, unwilling to move her hands from Agatha’s stomach.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey! Don’t bite a pregnant woman!” Agatha shot back. “Also, another reason I’m grateful we’re not having a girl. She’d absolutely be a biter. Just like her mother.” She knocked her head against Rio’s, a not so subtle cue that Rio was the mother in question.</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed because she knew for a fact that Agatha had definitely bit a kid before... as an adult.</p><p> </p><p>“Move and sit next to me, please. I want to see your face,” Agatha said. Well… demanded. The please she tacked on at the end was clearly just for show.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat up from where she’d been leaning into Agatha’s back and scooted around to her left side, nudging aside the book Agatha had abandoned earlier. She glanced at the cover. <em> Tiny Beautiful Things. </em></p><p> </p><p>“You like this?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave it a sideways look as she shifted, trying to get comfortable. “No.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “So you’re just letting it live? No public execution?”</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe,” Agatha muttered, finally settling.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio had flipped through it earlier- barely a mark. A few underlines, no sarcastic scribbles in the margins, no blood red corrections slicing through the text. For someone who treated her pen like a scalpel, that kind of mercy said everything.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha reached for her hand, dragging it back to her belly, her own falling just on top. And Rio, smiling now, didn’t press.</p><p> </p><p>“Per your earlier question…” Agatha said, voice quieter now, “it does.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. “What does?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sighed. “Seem unusual.”</p><p> </p><p>That got Rio’s full attention. Her eyes lit up at the possibility of a real conversation about the gaping hole in both their memories.</p><p> </p><p>“But I don’t think we’re meant to go digging around,” Agatha added quickly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her smile fade. “Why not?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down at where their hands rested together, then said, “Because whatever came before this... I don’t think it was better. And I like this life. I want this life. Even if I don’t know how we got here.”</p><p> </p><p>She gently pressed her hand against Rio’s, as if the baby growing inside her was explanation enough.</p><p> </p><p>“And you think that’s normal?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said. “But I think it’s good.” A beat passed before she added, “Have you thought about a name yet?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. Classic subject change- her wife’s signature move when she was done talking.</p><p> </p><p>For the most part, Rio felt the same. This life was good. She didn’t want to ruin it. But still, sue her for thinking it was weird that neither of them remembered where the hell they came from. Or who they really were before all this. There was a hole the size of a whole other life in their story, and Rio couldn’t help but want to look into it.</p><p> </p><p>“I like Nicholas,” she said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled, eyes flicking from her belly to Rio. “I love it,” she whispered.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah?” Rio asked, surprised by how fast the glow in her wife’s face could make her forget the conversation they’d just been having.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded. “I was scared you’d come up with something awful. Like… Branch.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio grinned. “Okay rude. But also, that’s actually kind of cute.”</p><p> </p><p>“It’s objectively awful,” Agatha said flatly. “Stop talking before I take away what little naming input you still have.”</p><p> </p><p>“All bark, no bite.” Rio leaned in and kissed her wife’s cheek before getting off the bed. “Hate to cut this domestic bliss short, but I need to get the car loaded. The market opens in an hour. I’ll come get you when I’m done so you don’t break your neck waddling down the stairs.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha groaned and grabbed the book she’d been reading, launching it at Rio’s head.</p><p> </p><p>Luckily, Rio saw it coming and ducked, laughing as it thudded harmlessly against the doorframe.</p><p> </p><p>Pain flared in her chest. She stumbled, one hand grabbing the doorframe, the other flying to her chest. “Fuck,” she hissed, breath short.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice cut in fast. “Your chest?” She was already pushing herself upright, struggling through the weight of her belly. “Rio, I told you to go back to the doctor.”</p><p> </p><p>“I have gone.” Rio gritted the words out between breaths, willing the pain to pass. “You were there. They ran every test. There’s nothing wrong.”</p><p> </p><p>“Then find someone who actually knows what the fuck they’re doing!” Agatha snapped, eyes wide and scared.</p><p> </p><p>The pain eased, but the pull didn’t. It was now a strange, familiar tug in her chest like someone had hooked a thread through her heart and was gently, insistently pulling.</p><p> </p><p>It had been happening for months. At first it was barely there, just a warm feeling Rio could ignore. But lately it had started to hurt. It felt desperate now. The more she ignored it, the worse it got, pressing harder each time, waiting for her to understand something she didn’t. It never lasted too long, always stopping on its own.</p><p> </p><p>Rio swallowed and crossed back to the bed. She leaned down and kissed her wife, trying to press calm into her lips. “I’ll make an appointment tomorrow, love. I swear.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t look convinced.</p><p> </p><p>Rio rested her palm on the swell of her wife’s belly. “Don’t worry about it, okay? You’ve got enough going on in here.”</p><p> </p><p>It was probably nothing. The doctors had said as much. Over and over.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, no problem! Same time next week?” Rio handed off a brown paper bag to one of their regulars.</p><p> </p><p>The market stretched in a patchwork of color and noise, nestled a few blocks from the sea. Canvas tents flapped in the breeze, their signs hand painted and sun faded. A man down the row shouted about fresh plums; somewhere farther, a guitar strummed a song no one was really listening to. Salt clung to the air. It always did this close to the coast.</p><p> </p><p>“Definitely,” the woman said with a smile. “Have a good one, Rio! You too, Agatha!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t bother answering. She sat back in her folding chair, legs crossed at the ankles, shoes resting on a crate of cherry tomatoes Rio had specifically told her not to use as a footrest. A book rested on her stomach, her fingers idly drumming the spine, gaze locked on its pages. She offered a half smile, all disinterest and distant threat.</p><p> </p><p>As the customer wandered off, Rio turned to her.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re going to scare people off, you know.” </p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned a page. “Only the ones who make a habit of flirting with my wife.”</p><p> </p><p>“That was one time. She didn’t know.”</p><p> </p><p>“That ring on your finger invisible or something?” Still, Agatha didn’t look up. “Doesn’t take a rocket scientist, Rio.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t respond. She couldn’t. The ache in her chest returned- sudden, sharp, wrong. She staggered, catching herself with one hand on the table, the other pressing hard over her heart. The air punched out of her lungs all at once, breath scraping on the way back in.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio!” Agatha’s chair scraped back. Her voice was low, teeth clenched, panic tucked beneath every syllable.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio rasped. “I’m fine.”</p><p> </p><p>Across the aisle, a girl was staring.</p><p> </p><p>She stood too still for the market. Early twenties, maybe. Something unreadable behind her eyes. Not startled. Not curious. Just... watching.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s gaze narrowed, but the pain in her chest flared again, forcing her to turn away.</p><p> </p><p>She leaned against the table, arm curled over her stomach, the other fisting in the fabric of her shirt like she could tear the ache out by hand. It dulled, eventually. Enough to breathe. Enough to lie.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was watching her, panic etched across her face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio opened her mouth to reassure her but a voice cut in before she could.</p><p> </p><p>“Holy shit, woman, you look like you’re about to pop!”</p><p> </p><p>Both she and Agatha snapped in unison.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey!”</p><p> </p><p>“Watch what the fuck you’re saying! That’s my wife,” Rio barked, already turning toward the source of the voice.</p><p> </p><p>But whatever fire she’d had fizzled the moment she saw who was standing in front of their booth.</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze.</p><p> </p><p>It was the girl. The same one from barely a minute ago, the one who’d been staring from across the market aisle. Now she was here, like she’d stepped across space without bothering to walk it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t move. She didn’t speak. She just stared.</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t explain her reaction- not the way her heart kicked hard against her ribs, or the way her thoughts tripped over themselves trying to make sense of a face that made no sense at all. The girl wasn’t familiar. Not exactly. But something in her set off every alarm.</p><p> </p><p>She looked like Agatha only younger. Her hair was dark and cropped short just above her shoulders, her eyes green where Agatha’s were blue, but the shape of her mouth, the angle of her jaw-</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt the pull again. It came quieter this time, warm against her ribs instead of sharp. Her hand rose to her chest before she even realized.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shifted behind her, trying to stand, and Rio turned immediately, catching her by the elbows before she could fully rise.</p><p> </p><p>“No, sit down. Please.” Rio’s voice softened without effort. “Don’t push yourself. I’m fine.” That last part was a lie, but it didn’t matter. Agatha’s comfort always came first. She pressed a hand to her wife’s side, trying to guide her back down into the chair. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha hesitated, eyes searching her face. But after a second, she lowered herself into the chair.</p><p> </p><p>Rio crouched so they were eye level. “You okay?” she asked, quieter now, eyes scanning her wife’s face, then dropping briefly to the swell of her stomach.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha nodded, reluctant. “You’re scaring me.” She whispered. </p><p> </p><p>Rio reached up, brushing a thumb along her cheek. “I know,” she said, barely above a whisper. “I’m sorry. Just stay seated, alright? I’ll handle it.”</p><p> </p><p>She lingered a moment longer, hand resting over Agatha’s as it settled against her belly. Only when she was sure Agatha wasn’t going to try to get up again did she push herself to her feet and turn back toward the girl.</p><p> </p><p>The girl hadn’t moved.</p><p> </p><p>Still standing there. Still watching.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped sideways and moved into the space between them, placing herself directly in front of Agatha without thinking. One silent step that blocked the girl’s view of her wife. It wasn’t a threat, just a line drawn.</p><p> </p><p>The girl pressed her lips together, then pulled them to the side like she was holding something back. When she looked at Rio again, there was a flicker across her face. Maybe hurt. It passed quickly.</p><p> </p><p>She kept her voice steady. Even. As polite as she could manage, “Looking for anything in particular?”</p><p> </p><p>The girl cleared her throat. "Yeah. You got any sage?" </p><p> </p><p>She was watching Rio closely, like she expected something to click.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gave her a puzzled look, then glanced down the booth. The sage was at the far end, past the rosemary and chamomile. Not far, just inconvenient. She looked at Agatha, then back at the sage. The space felt larger than it was. It was barely a few steps, but it felt like a choice.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio looked again, the girl had her eyebrows raised, waiting.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was being ridiculous. There was no threat. It was just sage. Just a girl. That was it. </p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded toward the end of the table and walked over. The girl followed.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached for one of the bags, ran her thumb over the label to smooth it down. She adjusted a few others, more to busy her hands than anything else.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage likes dry soil. Hates having wet roots. Kind of fussy for a plant that looks half dead most of the time,” the girl said.</p><p> </p><p>Rio kept her eyes on the bags, adjusting another one even though it didn’t need fixing.</p><p> </p><p>“That supposed to mean something?” Rio asked, not looking up.</p><p> </p><p>The girl shrugged. “Just a fact.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked up, “Need anything else?”</p><p> </p><p>The girl ignored the question. “How old are you?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. She was ready to snap back, but then she saw it.</p><p> </p><p>A necklace rested just below the girl’s collarbone, almost hidden. Two rings hung from it. One carved from bone, the other from wood.</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze. </p><p> </p><p>“They were my moms,” the girl said, pointedly enough to pull Rio’s eyes back to her face.</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked. “Sure,” she said, offering nothing more than a nod.</p><p> </p><p>“When I was kid, I dropped a bowl of soup on the floor,” the girl said. “It spilled everywhere. My mom said leave it, she'd take care of it, but I didn’t listen. I actually scrubbed it until the floors paneling was all discolored.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio had no idea what the point of the story was or why the girl bothered telling it. It didn’t go anywhere. Didn’t explain anything. She struck Rio as the type of person who rambled for attention, who built up meaningless interactions to make herself feel special.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio didn’t respond, the girl looked at her and shrugged. “I cleaned it up.”</p><p> </p><p>The tone of her voice hinted at sadness. She waited, maybe hoping Rio would say it was enough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio wasn’t here to interpret vague little stories from strangers who made her uneasy. This one talked like she was testing her, handing Rio some unspoken invitation.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t accept it.</p><p> </p><p>“You cleaned it up too much,’ Rio offered, more to end the conversation than to make a point. She even tossed in a shrug hoping to make it obvious that she didn’t care either way.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t know why her throat tightened, why she suddenly couldn’t swallow after saying it.</p><p> </p><p>The girl pressed her tongue into her cheek, looked down at the table, then back at her. “Yeah. A little too much,” she muttered. “That’ll be it. Thanks.” Her voice cracked as she handed over a twenty. She didn’t wait for change. Didn’t even take the sage. Just turned and walked off, shoulders tight, steps quick.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared after her.</p><p> </p><p>“Well that was fucking bizarre,” Agatha said flatly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned to look at her wife, and for the first time since the girl showed up, let out a short, breathy laugh. “Yeah,” she said, eyes still on Agatha. “It was.”</p><p> </p><p>Somehow, just seeing Agatha made everything feel okay again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked over to the metal box where they kept the cash, tossed the twenty inside, closed it, and turned back to her wife. She crouched beside her, reaching up to touch Agatha’s cheek, and leaned in to press their mouths together in a slow kiss. Her other hand settled on Agatha’s belly, the curve of it warm beneath her palm.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha kissed her back, and when she pulled away, her smile was soft and a little dazed. “What was that for?”</p><p> </p><p>The sun disappeared behind the clouds. Rio hadn’t noticed it happen, but the light had gone soft and gray around them, the warmth shifting with it. She glanced up once, only briefly, then looked back at Agatha and let it go.</p><p> </p><p>The way her wife looked at her made Rio feel light. Safe. Completely caught in the moment. “I love you,” Rio said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gave her a look that was half confused, half completely in love, like she was still trying to catch up to the moment. “I love you too.”</p><p> </p><p>The rest of the day passed like any other. Rio’s chest didn’t hurt again. No strange girls appeared at the booth. Everything felt normal. And she wasn’t about to let her mind wander back to that interaction, not when this- her wife, their little market stall, the sound of people laughing down the street- felt so much more real.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio had gotten almost everything loaded into the car. All that was left was her wife, the chair she was sitting in, and the empty crate beside her. As Rio turned back toward the booth space, she noticed a journal on the ground where her tables had been. It wasn’t one she recognized.</p><p> </p><p>She walked over, picked it up, and dropped it into the crate next to Agatha without giving it much thought. Someone must have left it behind.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stepped in front of her wife and held out both hands. Agatha took them, and Rio gently helped her to her feet, careful with the shift in weight. Once she was standing, Rio folded the chair and shoved it into its carrying bag. She swung it over her shoulder and picked up the crate with the journal inside.</p><p> </p><p>“You ready?” she asked.</p><p> </p><p>“Yup.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio nodded toward the parking lot and dipped her knees with a small grin. “Ma’lady.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha started walking, and as they made their way down the path, she asked, “What’s the journal?”</p><p> </p><p>“No clue. Someone must’ve dropped it. I’ll bring it back tomorrow in case they come looking.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed in response, and that was the end of it. For now.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Agatha and Rio were tucked into bed, sitting in the quiet that only came when the world had finally gone still. Rio held her close, a hand resting gently over the curve of Agatha’s belly.</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t recall the life they’d lived before, literally an enormous chasm of memories had been wiped away. And yet, that loss mattered little compared to this. Rio wouldn’t trade the life they had now to fill in the blanks, she knew that much for sure.</p><p> </p><p>She’d admit- what struck her most wasn’t that the past was missing. It was that her wife wasn’t the one digging for it. Agatha had let it go without a second thought. Anyone with half a brain cell would’ve bet on Agatha Harkness to drag every lost moment into the light, demanding answers, demanding truth. But she didn’t. She hadn’t.</p><p> </p><p>For whatever reason, and in complete defiance of everything that had ever defined them, it was Rio. And honestly? That was fucking laughable.</p><p> </p><p>Because Rio was the one waking up in the middle of the night with questions she didn’t know how to ask. The one clinging to half formed instincts and invisible red strings, chasing after things she literally could not name.</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>Most days, Rio carried it like a scar, closed and quiet. There was peace in that. In knowing she didn’t have to chase ghosts just to love what was real and already right in front of her. She didn’t need every page to trust the story. Not when the part she was living in had her wife beside her, and a future waiting to be held.  </p><p> </p><p>But there were days it nearly devoured her.</p><p> </p><p>Nearly nine months. For nearly nine months, they had woken up in the same bed, in a sun drenched house tucked along the coast. Two stories. Pale walls. Big windows. A garden that spanned the entire backyard and a greenhouse that had become Rio’s sanctuary. Agatha worked with words now, writing scathing reviews for a small press that published her critiques like gospel. Rio sold herbs and vegetables at the farmers market, trading produce for cash and whatever gossip people felt like giving.</p><p> </p><p>It was quiet. It was beautiful. It was theirs.</p><p> </p><p>That first morning nearly nine months ago, <em> Rio had woken with the startling sense that it was the first time she had ever truly taken a breath. She knew the room. Knew the house. Knew the curve of the coastline in the far distance outside their window and the way the sun fell in long gold ribbons across the floorboards. But still, it felt new. Like oxygen hitting the lungs of someone who hadn’t realized they’d been drowning. </em></p><p> </p><p>
<em> And beside her, Agatha slept- peacefully, as if she’d only ever lived a life built on love. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio couldn’t bear it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The stillness. The beauty. The fact that she had it. That this life, somehow, was hers. She hadn’t earned it. She didn’t remember fighting for it. But it was here. And Agatha was here. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She reached for her wife with homage. Pressed gentle kisses to her lips, her cheeks, the bridge of her nose, unable to keep still, unable to let the moment pass without marking it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha stirred slowly, blinking herself into the morning, and when her eyes met Rio’s, the first thing that bloomed across her face wasn’t confusion or sleep or surprise. It was peace. That same overwhelming peace that Rio felt flooding her own chest. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio kissed her again, deeper this time. Like she had won something. Like she had been given a life she didn’t even know was possible to experience. She kissed Agatha’s body with a devotion that wasn’t rushed, that didn’t need to be urgent to be consuming. Her hands moved over familiar skin like this body had been crafted to hold Agatha Harkness through eternity. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And when they made love, it was glorifying. Celebration. A communion between souls who had been burned down and rebuilt more than once, and somehow still found their way back to one another. Each touch was a thank you. Each breath a vow. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> They had only felt this exquisite knowing: they were exactly where they were meant to be. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> And when it was over, when the morning had stretched fully into day and they lay tangled in each other, Rio couldn’t stop the tears from slipping down her cheeks just from knowing that love this real could exist. That she was even here to feel i </em>t.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Later, Rio would look back and know this was when it happened. This was when they made him. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>It happened three days later, casually, like most terrifying things do.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> They were at the store, working through a modest grocery list. The wine had just been scanned when the cashier -a college kid with sunburned arms and the glazed look of someone working a summer job they couldn't care less about- asked, “Either of you wanna tell me your age?” Flat. Automatic. He’d probably already asked it five times that hour and expected zero resistance. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha and Rio both blinked at him. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> He shrugged, bored. “I have to card anyone who doesn’t look forty. Store policy.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio opened her mouth to answer without thinking-  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> But nothing came out.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Her mouth went dry. Her mind stalled. She scanned every corner of her brain, flipped through the mental files where that sort of thing should live. But there was nothing. No number. No date. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Next to her, Agatha was already rummaging through her purse, pulling out one of their wallets to hand over an ID. She knew, without having to ask, that Agatha didn’t know either. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> They walked to the car in silence. Rio slid behind the wheel, Agatha in the passenger seat. The keys were in the ignition, but the engine hadn’t been turned on. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio kept her hands on the wheel, fingers lightly curled in case she might’ve forgotten what they were for. She didn’t look at her wife when she spoke. “I don’t know how old I am,” she said softly. “I don’t even know my birthday.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha didn’t respond at first. She reached down, opened her purse again, and pulled out Rio’s wallet. She found the ID, read it, then held it up just long enough for Rio to see. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You’re thirty-eight,” Agatha said gently. “April twenty-fifth.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Arbor Day.” There was no humor in it, but she said it anyway, hoping that putting a label on the date would make it easier to hold. She blinked once. Then again, slower. “Sweet,” she whispered. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> When she finally looked over, Agatha was staring out the windshield. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “How old are you?” Rio asked in a voice that made the question feel smaller than it was. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Thirty-four,” Agatha answered after a beat. Her lips barely moved. “Cougar.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio let out a breath that might have been a laugh if she could’ve managed to put a little more strength in it. “Hardly.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The silence that followed was a guest that had overstayed its welcome. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha turned toward her slowly, like she’d been working up to it. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You know my birthday.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> It wasn’t a question. It wasn’t bait. Her wife was reaching. Hoping. Needed reassurance. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “November twenty-seventh.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> The answer left Rio’s mouth before she had time to doubt it.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha was nodding, the confirmation seemed to allow her wife’s lungs to work again. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> But Rio couldn’t breathe. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She didn’t know where the date had come from. Couldn’t trace it to a single birthday cake or passing of years. Couldn’t picture a celebration, or a candle, or even the sound of Agatha laughing on that day. It was just there, sitting somewhere in her brain, even if the rest of the picture was missing. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio heard herself whisper her wife’s name, and it came out too full of a fear she couldn’t disguise. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I know,” Agatha said quietly. “There’s more to it. But we don’t have to go digging today.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha reached across the console, fingers brushing Rio’s before gently prying her hand off the steering wheel. Rio hadn’t realized how tightly she’d been holding it until it was gone, her knuckles stiff and aching. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “We’re here. We’re safe. That’s enough for today.” Her wife’s thumb moved in slow, absent circles over Rio’s knuckles. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio nodded, because pretending not to be afraid was something she remembered how to do. She had always been good at that. And for now, her wife’s hand in hers made it easier to breathe.  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>They only talked about it a handful of times. Maybe twice that many, if Rio was being generous with what counted as talking. Agatha never wanted to, but it wasn’t avoidance. She just didn’t see the point in picking at a wound that would likely cause them both to bleed out. Still, she never left Rio to spiral alone. When it got too much, her wife was always there. Always the one to pull Rio back down to earth and remind her which way was up… or down. Who knows.</p><p> </p><p>The fear of forgetting had lived in Rio long before this. It wasn’t new. No. No, this fear felt familiar. It felt trapped in her, like dust in old floorboards, fucking impossible clean out. Even now, when so much was already lost, it wasn’t the gaps that haunted her. It was the knowing she might forget again. That one morning she might not remember how Agatha’s voice dipped when she was tired, or how she laughed, or the exact way her hair smelled when she leaned in too close.</p><p> </p><p>That fucking fear made a home out of every bone in her body.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha knew how to keep her from slipping. She’d take Rio’s hands and set them on her stomach, fingers splayed. Just skin, and breath, and the reminder that not everything was lost.</p><p> </p><p>And then Agatha would speak. Low, careful truths like they were spells.</p><p> </p><p>Her name. Her birthday. The way the garden bloomed for her even when the soil was wrong. That she loved green. That Agatha loved purple. That they both leaned toward the smell of sage in the early morning.</p><p> </p><p>They were small things. Easy to forget, maybe. But somehow, they always stayed. And it didn’t make the fear go away. But it gave it somewhere to rest.</p><p> </p><p>Rio could feel it in her body- that none of it was random. That whatever had been lost had been heavy enough to split her clean down the middle. Whatever they had lived through, whatever had been taken had probably been something awful. Probably something she wasn’t built to remember.</p><p> </p><p>So maybe this was her body’s way of surviving it. Dropping the memory and keeping only the part that mattered. The part that looked like Agatha, the swell beneath Rio’s palms, and soft whispers telling her she was real.</p><p> </p><p>“You’re thinking too much again,” Agatha said, her voice loose with sleep but certain in that way she always was when she spoke into the quiet.</p><p> </p><p>Rio flinched because she hadn’t realized she was anywhere but inside her own head. “What?” she asked, blinking toward the TV.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t open her eyes. “That girl. Is that what this is about?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose. “No. Fuck no,” she said, and she meant it, though the reminder of the girl set her teeth on edge. The one who had just shown up like she belonged at their booth. A stranger with no reason to be familiar. Rio pressed her palm into Agatha’s belly without thinking, grounding herself in the two things that made sense. He kicked back and Agatha let out a low groan.</p><p> </p><p>The tension in Rio dissolved almost instantly.</p><p> </p><p>She glanced over, her smirk creeping in. “Bladder again?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hummed like she wasn’t entirely awake but didn’t disagree.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tried to let it go, tried to let her mind settle into the noise of the show and Agatha beside her, but the question stayed. “Why do you always say my silence is loud?” she asked, not looking for a conversation that might keep her from slipping back into the ache.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stretched a little under the blanket. “Because it is. You don’t talk, but it fills the room anyway.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head. “That’s not a real answer.”</p><p> </p><p>“It doesn’t have to be,” Agatha said, her voice still soft. “I know what I mean.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let that sit for a minute. She didn’t really want to think about the girl, but the question had already worked its way out. “You recognize her?”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said, and then she shifted a little more, hand moving over her stomach. “But the second she was there, Nicky started acting like he was trying to punch his way out.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes stayed on the ceiling and her breath was held tight. “Like a warning?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a sound, not quite a laugh, but not a no either. “Didn’t feel like one. Felt like he was excited. Like he was happy she was close.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio exhaled. Her whole body seemed to sink deeper into the bed. “Still weird,” she said under her breath.</p><p> </p><p>The show played on in the background, but neither of them were watching. Rio kept her eyes open for a while, but her thoughts blurred, softening in the way they did when her body got ahead of her mind.</p><p> </p><p>“You’d be so good at it,” Rio mumbled, her words barely stitched together, slurred with sleep and sinking fast. “Raising a girl… being her mom.” It wasn’t even conscious. “I love you,” came next.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t stir.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio, eyes shut, brain fogged, had no idea she’d said anything at all.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Rio woke at the witching hour, like she always did. Three a.m. on the dot. Some nights she’d wake with her heart already racing, like she’d been dreaming of something important and forgot it the second her eyes opened. Other nights, it was quieter. Just the pull of her body toward the dark, like the earth was calling out to her.</p><p> </p><p>She’d heard of the witching hour. A time stitched between days, when logic thinned and strange things slipped through. Supposedly, it was when spirits wandered and spells took place, when the living and the dead were closest. Folklore. Superstition. It was harmless, dramatic. Still, there was something about the timing. The precision. It didn’t feel superstitious. It felt personal.</p><p> </p><p>Rio never tried to sneak out. There was no need. Agatha never stirred when she left their bed, never rolled over or asked where she was going. But Rio knew it wasn’t ignorance. Her wife noticed everything. If Rio tried to keep secrets from her, even small ones, she’d be met with an attitude sharp enough to flay her. And if she really tried to lie -if she woke every night at the same time and walked the halls like it meant nothing- Agatha wouldn’t argue. She would simply serve Rio her own head on a platter with a folded napkin.</p><p> </p><p>Most nights, Rio found herself in the greenhouse. Sometimes in the garden. Always surrounded by things that grew. There was something grounding in it, the way the soil clung to her fingertips.</p><p> </p><p>Only once, had Rio tried to speak to a plant in a language she didn’t know. It felt familiar in her mouth. The syllables rang in her bones with memory. She watched the plant, half expecting it to rise, to glow, to bloom, but nothing happened. The leaf stayed curled, the stem bent.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t try again.</p><p> </p><p>Still, the idea lingered. She found herself wondering, when the nights stretched too long, whether they had been witches before this life. It sounded absurd. But how else did two women create life without intervention, without science, without even knowing how?</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t believe in magic. She didn’t believe in ghosts or spells or anything that bent the rules of what was natural. But Agatha was carrying a child. Their child. And there was no answer for that. No simple explanation.</p><p> </p><p>Sometimes she thought Agatha knew more than she let on. Not in a secretive way, but in a quiet, careful one. Agatha never dismissed her questions. Never scoffed at her when Rio mentioned waking at the same time every night or the strange comfort she found in speaking to plants. She would just listen, then reach for Rio’s hand. Or change the subject. Or smile in that way that wasn’t snide, just sad.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha never chased the past. She didn’t dig. And Rio got the sense it wasn’t because she didn’t care, but because she did. Too much.  Maybe her wife already suspected enough and had chosen this version of their lives over the one that might break it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio could never let it go.</p><p> </p><p>It had nothing to do with wanting the life they’d left behind. She wasn’t trying to get back to anything. She didn’t even know what was back there. It was probably bitter, cruel, cold in a way their home here wasn’t. And even if it hadn’t been, even if there had been joy in it, it didn’t matter now.</p><p> </p><p>What got under Rio’s skin was how she couldn’t shake the feeling that a piece of herself had been left behind.</p><p> </p><p>It would happen randomly, she’d be tending to the plants or walking back through the hall and it would hit her. A pause in her breath. A stillness that didn’t belong.</p><p> </p><p>She always caught herself listening for footsteps that never came.</p><p> </p><p>And it wasn’t just her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio noticed it in Agatha too. Not in anything she said, but in the pauses. In the way her wife's hand would settle low on her belly without thought, fingers tracing slow, absent circles. She’d stand in a room and go still for a moment too long, her attention drifting toward nothing. Just... listening for something.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha never mentioned it. Neither of them did. But it was there.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio wasn’t the only one listening for footsteps.</p><p> </p><p>Rio shook her head, trying to clear the haze of whatever had been circling her thoughts. Tonight, her feet hadn’t led her to the garden or the greenhouse. Without really meaning to, she’d ended in the doorway of their son’s room.</p><p> </p><p>She stepped inside, eyes scanning the space incase it might change. But it never did. Every time she looked, it was exactly the same. Familiar. Calming. Real.</p><p> </p><p>Moonlight spilled in through the window, catching on the curve of the crib, the soft colors of the walls, the little details they’d picked out over months. Everything was in place. The furniture. The clothes. The folded blankets that Agatha kept refolding no matter how neatly Rio had done it the first time.</p><p> </p><p>The room was done.</p><p> </p><p>And standing in it, for a long breath, it made it easier to pretend they were just listening for him. That any minute now, she and Agatha would hear the soft patter of footsteps across the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Rio thought about the morning it all started.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha had gotten sick without warning- woken up, mumbled something about ‘being fucking nauseous’, and disappeared into the bathroom with no other explanation. Rio followed close behind, already worried, brushing the hair from her wife's face, asking if she was okay. When Agatha waved her off and shuffled back to bed, Rio tucked her in without a word, pressed her palm lightly to her forehead, and said she’d be back soon. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha didn’t even ask where she was going. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio hadn’t known what she was looking for. She’d wandered the aisles in a daze until her hand reached for a pregnancy test, and only after it was in her basket did she pause to ask herself why. No plan they’d made, no moment where any of it had seemed possible. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> But her body had known. She bought six pregnancy tests. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> When Rio stepped into the bedroom, Agatha was still under the blanket, propped against the headboard with a glass of water and the ghost of a smirk on her face. She didn’t look sick anymore, just vaguely smug in that way that made Rio deeply nervous. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha had taken the box with the same certainty that Rio had felt when she picked it up. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> But before her wife could even make a move to open it, Rio reached forward and snatched it right back. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I just want to read the instructions,” Rio said, flipping the box over. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha held out her hand, palm open and waiting. “I know how to pee in a cup, Rio.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “I believe you. I just also believe in thoroughness.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio stood beside the bed and read the instructions once through. Then again. And again. Her eyes moved across the page, her lips pressing tighter the longer she read. Once she was satisfied she had absorbed every word, she cleared her throat and started reading them out loud. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Okay. Pee in the cup first. Then dip each test in for five seconds. One at a time. Make sure the strip is fully covered, then lay it flat- flat is important, apparently. Wait five minutes. No tilting, no peeking early, and definitely no reusing.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha huffed, amused but trying not to show it. “Give me the test, Rio.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio glanced up. “I just need you to do it right.”  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> There was something soft behind Agatha’s smile now. “I know.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio pulled five more boxes from the bag and stacked them neatly on Agatha’s lap. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha stared at her, then looked down at the pile of tests in her lap. “Are you kidding?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “We need to be absolutely sure.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Sure about what? That you’re insane?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio didn’t flinch. “Yes. And that we’re not imagining this.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha sighed through her nose but didn’t protest. She gathered the boxes and stood, brushing the blanket off her legs. “You’re lucky I love you.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio didn’t say anything. She just watched her wife walk to the bathroom with the door half open, every step feeling both too long and not long enough. </em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em> Rio sat at the edge of the bed, chewing the inside of her cheek, clutching the crinkled instructions and rereading the part about the wait time again and again hoping time would move faster if she just understood it hard enough. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Then Agatha’s voice floated out from the bathroom, “Your science experiment is complete.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio stood up so fast the bed creaked in protest, but her feet didn’t carry her forward. “All of them?” she called out, not quite daring to cross the room. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Every single stick.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She heard the faucet shut off. Then Agatha stepped out of the bathroom, calm and barefoot, one pregnancy test held delicately between two fingers. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “They all say the same thing,” she said, holding it up between them. </em>
</p><p> </p><p><em> Rio stared. Clear, unmistakable letters. </em> <b> <em>PREGNANT.</em> </b></p><p> </p><p>
<em> She read it once. Then again. Then a third time. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha lowered the test. “I double checked,” she said gently, stepping closer, “then I triple checked because I know who I’m married to.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio’s vision tunneled, white creeping. Her knees weren’t exactly weak- just… rebellious. The world tilted. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Oh, for fuck’s sa-” was the last thing Rio heard before it all went dark. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> She came to lying flat on her back, her wife kneeling beside her, smiling like she'd just won a bet she never planned on losing. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “You fainted,” Agatha said, too pleased. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “No,” Rio croaked, blinking up at the ceiling. “I just… very suddenly and enthusiastically chose to lie down on the floor.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Mhm.” Agatha smoothed a hand through her hair, her fingers gentle. “You okay?” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> “Amazing,” Rio deadpanned. “I love you so much I forgot how to stand.” </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha laughed softly and leaned in. “We’re having a baby,” she whispered. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Rio’s eyes widened, then softened. “We’re having a baby,” she repeated, voice catching. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Agatha touched her cheek, nodding. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> And Rio- well, she broke out in a laugh, a sob, whatever it was, it tore through her like light through stained glass, every color of feeling flooding in at once. There was no separating awe from disbelief, no sense trying to hold anything back. She reached for Agatha, her wife. The kiss she pulled her into wasn’t neat or gentle. It was trembling and full of stunned gratitude, messy with wonder and all the words she didn’t know how to say. Agatha kissed her back without doubt, meeting her in that chaos. And on the floor, Rio loved her- fully, reverently, like it was the first time and the last time and every lifetime in between. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Later, completely naked, Rio stood in the bathroom, staring down at all six sticks. She read the directions again, just in case. Behind her, Agatha -also completely naked, perched on the toilet lid like it was a throne- walked her through each step she took, explaining how she followed the instructions to the letter. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked away the memory, a quiet laugh slipping past her lips. She turned and stepped out of her son's room, padding down the stairs with that dazed, post reminiscing haze still clinging to her. But the moment her foot hit the last step, chaos arrived on four legs.</p><p> </p><p>Señor Scratchy shot across the floor like he’d been launched from a cannon, his tiny feet skidding wildly on the floor. He banked off the wall with a dull thunk, vanished into the kitchen like a furry missile, and something definitely fell.</p><p> </p><p>Rio paused, stared blankly after him, and muttered, “Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>She wandered into the study.</p><p> </p><p>Technically, it was Agatha’s office- lined with towering bookshelves, a desktop humming softly in the middle of the room atop a desk, and whatever papers Agatha had left scattered across it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio mostly used the computer to google things and doom scroll Reddit when her existential dread got too loud.</p><p> </p><p>Her tarantula’s enclosure sat in front of the window, pristine and climate controlled, like a little throne room for her eight legged buddy- who, unlike Señor Scratchy, never caused a single kitchen disaster.</p><p> </p><p>She walked over and opened the enclosure, holding her hand out, palm up. Petunia hesitated only a second before crawling into it, legs brushing lightly against her skin.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi, Tootie,” Rio whispered absently, the nickname felt belonged to someone else and had just passed through.</p><p> </p><p>She crossed the room, switched on the desk lamp, and sank into the chair. The book she’d left behind was still on the desk, spine cracked open, pages marked by half finished thoughts. She placed Petunia gently on the surface, and the spider immediately scurried onto the keyboard.</p><p> </p><p>It was a parenting book. The woman at the bookstore had said it was a favorite among <em> ‘nervous first timers,’ </em> and Rio had nodded because that meant her.</p><p> </p><p>She was supposed to be one of those. A first timer. Totally new to all of this.</p><p> </p><p>The book was practical. No frills. It broke things down into neat categories: emotional regulation, developmental milestones, discipline styles. The tone was clinical in a way that usually comforted her. It was structured. Predictable. Safe.</p><p> </p><p>This should’ve been her thing.</p><p> </p><p>But it wasn’t landing right. </p><p> </p><p>The number three showed up constantly. Three developmental phases. Three types of correction. Three core needs. The more Rio noticed it, the more it pissed her off. She couldn’t explain why.</p><p> </p><p>Three had always followed her. She woke at three every morning, without fail. She checked things three times, said things in three, sometimes without realizing she was doing it. Three ruled her life here. </p><p> </p><p>It wasn't a ritual. It was compulsion, and it made her skin itch.</p><p> </p><p>People liked to call the number balanced, even symbolic. For Rio, it felt incomplete. Like someone had stopped counting just before the world made sense. Like expected footsteps that never came.</p><p> </p><p>She had always preferred four. Four felt grounded. Whole. A shape you could stand in. But no matter how she tried, something always pulled her back to three- over and over. And it never felt right.</p><p> </p><p>Her eyes skimmed a section on feeding schedules and routines and she rolled them before she could stop herself. Whoever wrote it had never actually been in the room with a child who wouldn’t eat. Who screamed for no reason. Who needed more than a schedule.</p><p> </p><p>The book, with its clinical tone and carefully ordered rules, leaned on that same balance. It told her how to build trust, how to manage meltdowns, how to shape behavior- all in clear sequences, all in threes. It was designed to calm uncertainty. But as she read, something in her pushed back. The advice wasn’t wrong, exactly, but it was too tidy. Too polished to be true.</p><p> </p><p>She found herself silently rewriting parts of it- shifting emphasis, changing tone, dismissing certain examples entirely. She hadn’t meant to. The corrections rose without thought, as though she’d lived it, and knew what the book refused to say.</p><p> </p><p>She paused with her fingers resting on the edge of the page. There was no reason she should be this confident in what the book left out. She hadn’t raised a child. And yet she felt certain about what was missing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat back slightly and closed the book. It wasn’t that the information was useless. It was just too polished to be true. She liked order. Order was supposed to be enough. That was the promise. If you followed the rules, things would work. If you stayed consistent, if you remained calm, the pieces would fall into place. She had built herself around that.</p><p> </p><p>But children weren’t predictable. Pregnancy wasn’t predictable. And Agatha, most of all, wasn’t predictable. She was contradiction, interruption, and mess.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had never loved anyone more.</p><p> </p><p>She had known for certain that loving chaos didn’t mean she had failed order. It meant the system had to stretch to include what didn’t fit.</p><p> </p><p>And this book… didn’t know how to stretch.</p><p> </p><p>Petunia paused on the space bar.</p><p> </p><p>“You think it’s weird too, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>Silence.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Good.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t want an answer.</p><p> </p><p>She stared at Petunia, still motionless on the space bar, and let her eyes drift across the desk.</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze. </p><p> </p><p>The journal.</p><p> </p><p>She remembered exactly where she’d left it. In the crate. In the car.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand hovered just above the cover now, her fingers tense. It didn’t make sense. She hadn’t taken it out of the car. She hadn’t moved it. She hadn’t touched it since tossing it in the crate.</p><p> </p><p>Maybe it was nosiness. Maybe it was something else. But every part of her said she needed to read it.</p><p> </p><p>Yes, opening someone else’s journal was probably a violation of privacy- <em>technically</em>. But Rio’s moral compass had always been flexible when it came to other people. Strangers didn’t rank high on her ethical scale. Unless the handwriting inside belonged to Agatha, she could live with the guilt.</p><p> </p><p>She felt she’d done worse.</p><p> </p><p>And if the universe had dropped it on her desk without explanation, she figured she had permission to look... Or at least a good excuse.</p><p> </p><p>Rio snatched the journal and flipped it open. A folded piece of paper was tucked into the spine. She didn’t bother unfolding it. It looked ancient, like it might fall apart if she breathed on it wrong.</p><p> </p><p>A sticky note clung to the inside cover, on the left side. The handwriting pulled at a memory she couldn’t place. Familiar, but not hers. Obviously not her wife’s.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> If you forget. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>“Weird,” Rio mumbled, and turned to the first page.</p><p> </p><p>Rio nearly shit her pants when she saw what was on the first page.</p><p> </p><p>It was Agatha. Not as she knew her now, and not quite as she remembered from before, but younger- captured in a portrait that felt preserved from a lifetime she hadn’t lived. Below the portrait was her wife's full name, date of birth, and place of birth, everything cataloged like a record in a forgotten archive. Next to her name, in a scrawl that made Rio’s chest tighten, were two words: <em> Your wife. </em></p><p> </p><p>The handwriting was her own. Not similar to hers, not close- <em> hers. </em></p><p> </p><p>Her vision swam, her brain trying to retreat behind her eyes, but her fingers kept moving. She turned the page.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Nicholas Scratch- Your son  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t read it. She couldn’t. Her eyes skimmed the words, but her chest already knew. Her stomach turned. The next page bled through before she’d even finished the last.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> Sage Vidal-Harkness- Your daughter </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The smile Rio could never remember to miss.</p><p> </p><p>A gust tore through the room with no warning, sending loose papers flying from the desk. The lamp flickered violently.  Her hair blew across her face, but she didn't registered it. The journal was all she could see. Her grip on it tightened, her fingers digging into the binding.</p><p> </p><p>She flipped faster now. Her eyes scanned, but she wasn’t reading- she was absorbing. Line after line in her own voice rising from the pages like something trying to crawl out from beneath the earth.</p><p> </p><p>
<em> You let her touch you. You touched her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You have forgotten who you are. </em>
</p><p>
<em> The night came, his heart stopped. </em>
</p><p>
<em> But she is yours. And you love her. </em>
</p><p>
<em> Still, you pray. </em>
</p><p>
<em> You are Death.  </em>
</p><p>
<em> She still hates you. </em>
</p><p>
<em> And you have forgotten what you are. Who you are. </em>
</p><p>
<em> For once, you do not wish to remember. </em>
</p><p> </p><p>The words blurred as her eyes skimmed them, but her body remembered. Her blood remembered. Her bones remembered. Everything came flooding back in a rush that felt like drowning.</p><p> </p><p>Her chest felt entirely too tight. She sucked in a breath that didn’t make it all the way down.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tried to stand.</p><p> </p><p>The chair scraped back just an inch before her knees buckled. The journal slipped from her lap as she collapsed to the floor, catching herself on her palms with a jolt that shook her spine. The ringing in her ears grew louder. She scrambled forward, hands shaking, and crawled toward the mini trashcan tucked beside Petunia’s enclosure.</p><p> </p><p>She barely made it before the nausea took over. The vomit hit hard and sudden, her ribs clenching with each convulsion, her hair sticking to her cheek.  Her stomach emptied, but the memories didn’t stop. They kept coming, relentless and whole.</p><p> </p><p>She rolled onto her back. Cold floor. Spinning ceiling. Her chest heaving violently.</p><p> </p><p>A sob cracked out of Rio before she could stop it. Then another. They tore through her until she was choking on them. She rolled onto her side, curled slightly with one arm cradling her ribs.</p><p> </p><p>She couldn’t move. Couldn’t breathe around the flood of it- Nicky’s final breath, Agatha’s silence, the crack in her wife's voice when she’d said she would hate Rio forever. The pain came back in full color, unmerciful, until all she could do was sob. Cry for what she’d taken. Cry for who she used to be. Cry because now, finally, she remembered it all.</p><p> </p><p>She remembered everything.</p><p> </p><p>But somewhere beyond the sobs tearing through her, beyond the ringing in her ears, the tremble in her limbs, and what felt like her heart breaking into pieces, a single thought cut through the noise- clear, blinding, and brutal.</p><p> </p><p>She’d passed Death on to Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Her mind stalled there- spinning, stuck, unable to move past the name now roaring through her.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage!”</p><p> </p><p>The word tore out of her with so much force she felt her soul rattle. She lurched upright.. Her knees barely held. She scrambled to her feet, socks sliding on the hardwood, her hip catching the edge of the desk as she staggered forward. She tripped over her own feet but didn’t stop. Couldn’t stop. She didn’t even pause to look back. She had to find her. She had to find her now<em> . </em></p><p> </p><p>She hadn’t recognized her. Her own daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio flung the front door open with a force that rattled the hinges. She didn’t bother with shoes. She was still in her oversized blue sweatshirt, gray shorts, andmatched white socks. It didn’t matter. The world outside was blurred by wind and memory, but her feet moved like they had their own orders.</p><p> </p><p>She ran.</p><p> </p><p>Her legs carried her without permission. Her heart led her where her magic used to.</p><p> </p><p>Three miles. She didn’t slow.</p><p> </p><p>Her feet hit the sand, sinking slightly with each step. The ocean stretched out in front of her, the sky still dark, the wind relentless. Waves crashed. Salt burned her throat.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stopped well before the shoreline, her body spinning in place. She scanned the beach, desperate, eyes wide and stinging. Nothing. No movement. No figure in the distance. Just the wind and the surf and the harshness of her own breath. Her chest heaved as she lifted her hands to her head, fingers tangling in her hair, as she stared out at the ocean.</p><p> </p><p>It was too loud, too restless, too much like her.</p><p> </p><p>She had always believed the earth would be the only thing to remember her name. It held the shape of her hands, the trace of her steps, the quiet of what once grew under her care. It preserved her absence, not her presence.</p><p> </p><p>Where the earth remembered her gently, the sea would offer no such mercy.</p><p> </p><p>It remembered Rio fully. It had known her before there was language for what she was. Before Death. Before forgetting. It carried every version of her and offered them back in sound.</p><p> </p><p>She tried to breathe. To still her hands. To quiet whatever was rising inside her before it swallowed everything else. If she could settle herself, maybe the rest would soften too.</p><p> </p><p>But the ocean only grew louder.</p><p> </p><p>The wind turned wild. The waves rose higher. The sea refused to meet her halfway. It reflected what she couldn’t contain, gave design to what she didn’t ask to feel. It knew her in ways nothing else did, and it offered no kindness in return.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned away from its roar, breath still ragged. She stayed there, her body unmoving, her back to the water that still reached for her. There was no peace in facing it. No comfort in being seen that completely.</p><p> </p><p>And maybe that was what hurt most of all. That it still remembered her. That it would keep remembering her long after she could no longer bear to face it.</p><p> </p><p>The wind circled Rio. It carried the memory of storms, of joy, of heartbreak that could split the heavens. The weather had always held chaos and order in the same breath. She had taught it to rise, to thunder, to calm. She had shaped it, and it had reshaped her in return.</p><p> </p><p>The ocean had always moved first. It was the beginning. It called out long before the sky was ever born to answer.</p><p> </p><p>That was what they had been. Sea and sky. Question and reply.</p><p> </p><p>But what is the ocean without its sky?</p><p> </p><p>A body waiting for its storm.</p><p> </p><p>Rio reached for her daughter. There was no spell on her lips. No focus. No formality. Just instinct. Just that deep, familiar pull in her chest. The place that had always responded to Sage before anything else. The part of her that had never forgotten even when everything else had.</p><p> </p><p>Then the sun broke the horizon. It wasn’t sudden, but it felt like it. A breath taken after holding too much for too long. Light unfurled across the waves, and in its warmth, the world shifted.</p><p> </p><p>The sea quieted because it was no longer alone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s body moved before reason could catch up, guided by the knowing that had always lived just beneath her breath.</p><p> </p><p>A solitary figure near the shoreline, shoulders squared, facing the hoirzon. The morning light stretched around her daughter like it wasn’t sure whether to touch or worship her. The waves had quieted, the wind had stilled but Rio remained frozen, not trusting what her eyes were trying to tell her.</p><p> </p><p>Then Sage turned.</p><p> </p><p>It was slow. Hesitant. Like she hadn’t expected to be called at all. Her face, when it came into view, looked almost startled.</p><p> </p><p>She wore black, the shape of her form almost swallowed by Rio’s old cloak- wrapped high and close across her chest like armor. The folds were purposeful, bound like something sacred meant to protect her. Agatha’s locket was pinned to her left shoulder, the purple and white standing out against the black she wore. A dagger rested at her hip.</p><p> </p><p>Her hood was pushed back, on her head was a crown that belonged to no one but her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>It was black, shaped like twisted vines, tight fitting, almost severe, with a single point angled toward her brow. Threads of green and violet wove through the metal catching light only when she turned.</p><p> </p><p>There was a flicker. Rio blinked, and Sage was no longer in her uniform. Suddenly, she was dressed in something Rio had seen her wear a thousand times before. A sleeveless sweater, loose fitting jeans, and her black converse. Familiar. Utterly ordinary. Devastatingly real.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s face was wet. The tears gathered along her chin, slipping down like they’d been falling for a while.</p><p> </p><p>Then, without warning, Sage was running toward her. Full speed. Rio didn’t move. She couldn’t. But her arms opened anyway, and she caught her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>The force of the hug pushed Rio back a few steps. She stumbled, but she didn’t fall.</p><p> </p><p>Sage held her with a strength Rio had never felt from her daughter before. And Rio held her in return, maybe not as tightly, but with everything she had. Her hand cradled the back of Sage’s head, fingers threading through her hair.</p><p> </p><p>"Petal," The name left Rio’s mouth fully formed, without question or doubt. It belonged to her. It always had. Her lips pressed against Sage’s hair, firm and trembling. </p><p> </p><p>Sage nodded desperately like she had been waiting to hear it spoken that way again.</p><p> </p><p>Rio drew her back, her hands cupping either side of Sage’s face. She needed to see her daughter. Needed to take in every detail. Every moment she missed carved into this face.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s face was the same and different all at once. Eyelashes damp. Mouth tight. Her green eyes were holding back tears with the same stubborn determination she used to have as a child. Her jaw trembled, but she didn’t look away from Rio.</p><p> </p><p>The sky had turned grey. Thick clouds hung above them. The sun remained behind them, struggling to return. Relief sat beside sorrow. Both took up space.</p><p> </p><p>Sage hadn’t aged in any way a body might show. Her face held the same softness, the same youth. But there was a difference. A depth in her green eyes that hadn’t been there before. It came from walking beside the dead and never looking away. From witnessing too much and bearing it in silence.</p><p> </p><p>“Your hair’s darker,” Rio whispered. Her gaze kept moving, greedy for proof. She had to catalog every detail, anything to convince herself this was real.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s cheeks remained full. No hollows beneath her eyes. No trace of decay or strain. She looked whole. But Rio saw past the surface. She saw the stillness. The calm that had settled where something wilder used to live.</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter had seen horrors. Not stories. Not shadows. The real thing. And still, she was standing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t expected that to feel like comfort. But it did because survival meant something. Because even if she couldn’t protect her daughter from what she’d seen, she could still recognize the strength it took to endure it. To still be standing. To still be Sage.</p><p> </p><p>"How old are you?" The same question Sage had asked just yesterday morning at the booth when Rio didn’t know who she was talking to.</p><p> </p><p>“Thirty eight,” Rio said. “Is this the afterlife?” She needed to know.</p><p> </p><p>A small smirk tugged at Sage’s mouth as she glanced away, then gave a sheepish shake of her head. “The surface.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio went still.</p><p> </p><p>First of all, that was not the fucking plan. But Rio caught the shift behind those green eyes that always held too much damn mischief. The smirk Sage gave her was small, tight, almost careful. And Rio knew that look. Knew it like instinct. She was hiding something. Not lying, not exactly. Just holding it back, tucking it somewhere she thought Rio wouldn’t see.</p><p> </p><p>But Rio always did.</p><p> </p><p>Sage spoke fast, “It’s a long story.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio knew Sage wasn’t lying. But that answer was her daughter’s way of shrinking whatever she was hiding down to nothing. And more times than Rio could count, she had learned the hard way that when Sage made something sound small, it almost never was.</p><p> </p><p>“Good. I’m not going anywhere.” Rio pointed to the ground. “Sit. Start talking.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage swallowed hard, sat down in the sand, and pulled her knees to her chest. Rio lowered herself beside her.</p><p> </p><p>“What did you do?” Rio asked.</p><p> </p><p>Sage kept her eyes on the ground. “Took a calculated risk,” she mumbled into her knees.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath, panic flaring in her chest. “Sage, did you- ” She glanced around instinctively like someone might overhear them. There was no one, of course, but she still dropped her voice to a harsh whisper as she turned back to her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>“Did you fucking resurrect us?”</p><p> </p><p>“No. No, I know you wouldn’t take too kindly to that.” Sage turned to her, quick and defensive, eyes locked on her mother now.</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter was right. The idea of resurrection was so deeply perverted to her, so unnatural, she could barely stomach it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio held Sage’s stare. “Then how are we here?” She asked through gritted teeth.</p><p> </p><p>Sage looked away again, pressing her tongue into her cheek. Rio followed the motion with a tilt of her head, eyebrows raised-  <em> I’m waiting </em></p><p> </p><p>Sage let out a frustrated breath. “I, uh… I guess I…” She cleared her throat, shook her head, then pushed the words out. “I basically rewrote your existences?” It came out like a question, but the proof was in the sand beside her. “Both of you. I tried to give you a life without all the suffering.” She hesitated, jaw tightening. “It didn’t go the way I thought it would.”</p><p> </p><p>That was all her daughter said but it was enough. The gaps. The disjointed memories. The way they hadn’t been born into the world, just dropped into the middle of it. None of it had gone exactly to plan.</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio could react, Sage snapped her eyes back to her. “And no, I don’t regret it. You both deserved better than what was handed to you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a huff and shook her head. “I knew there was a trick in there.”</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter was just like her wife- always planning, always four steps ahead. But where Sage did it out of love, Agatha did it because she was hurting. Her wife had lost so much, and Rio had been part of that loss. So, Rio had stood in the path of that pain again and again, knowing it was hers to bear. If shouldering it made Agatha’s grief even a breath lighter, she would do it again. Every time. Without question.</p><p> </p><p>Sage grunted in response, but Rio caught the shift immediately. She still wasn’t telling her everything. Maybe she was trying to protect Rio. Maybe she didn’t want to make things worse.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me what else you’re hiding,” Rio said gently. “Please. I won’t be upset. I promise.”</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter tugged her bottom lip between her teeth, stared out toward the sea, then turned back to her mother.</p><p> </p><p>“When you died… I thought it didn’t work.” Sage’s voice caught. “It, uh…” She swallowed, and the effort alone told Rio how much it still hurt.</p><p> </p><p>Without thinking, Rio leaned into her daughter, their shoulders touching. She hoped the gesture would give Sage something to hold onto.</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter’s shoulders eased beneath the contact. That was all it took. Rio felt her chest tighten- This was still the baby she once held, the girl she once knew. No matter what was lost or forgotten.</p><p> </p><p>This was still her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>“It felt final,” Sage said quietly. “You died. For real. And the realm knew it. It mourned you right away.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s breath stilled.</p><p> </p><p>“She followed pretty quickly,” Sage added. “Only minutes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio lifted her head to the sky. The clouds still hung thick and unmoving. No sun. Just gray, endless gray. She closed her eyes, trying to breathe through the sudden heaviness in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was never supposed to go. That wasn’t part of the plan.</p><p> </p><p>Only now did Rio understand what Sage was really saying. Agatha’s unfinished business… had been her.</p><p> </p><p>Her heart soared at the miracle of it- that, once again, their love had bent the rules in a way Rio didn’t have a hand in. But at the same time, it broke for Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter had been alone.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t know for certain, but she assumed it had been nearly nine months- the same amount of time she and Agatha had been on the surface.</p><p> </p><p>She looked back at Sage as her daughter continued, “I panicked. My ties to the afterlife… it wasn’t the same. I didn’t have access to it anymore. At least, not the way I used to. So I adjusted. Changed my approach.”</p><p> </p><p>There was a falter in her daughter’s voice now, a hesitation that made Rio go still again. That alone told Rio everything she needed to know. This wasn’t arrogance. This wasn’t a mistake Sage was proud of.</p><p> </p><p>“Petal.” Rio’s voice came quiet, strained. She wasn’t disappointed- god, no. She was terrified. Terrified for what her daughter had endured at the hands of a balance that demanded everything and gave nothing in return. A cycle so ruthless it devoured its own protector.</p><p> </p><p>Guilt rose fast, curling around her throat tight like a noose. Her eyes began to sting.</p><p> </p><p>“I made it,” Sage said, voice thick. “It wasn’t easy, but I got there. I actually fucking did it.” She let out a watery laugh, small and broken. “And you weren’t there. Mom wasn’t there. Even Nicky was gone.”</p><p> </p><p>She paused. Her eyes dropped. “I just.. I fucked up so bad. A mess so huge I couldn’t clean it up, no matter what I tried. There was literally no way to fix it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s voice cracked into a whisper. “What does that mean?” She already knew she wouldn’t like the answer.</p><p> </p><p>Sage dragged her tongue against the inside of her cheek, like she was holding back the words. The huff she let out sounded tired and bitter, like the universe had played some long, cruel joke just on her. And maybe it had.</p><p> </p><p>Her daughter looked… embarrassed. Truly embarrassed. And Rio had never seen that before- not in Sage.</p><p> </p><p>“I was stuck,” Sage said finally. “I couldn’t leave. Not by choice.” She exhaled like she was bracing for the hurt she was about to hand over to her mother.</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt it. Felt it split down the middle of her chest. Her breath caught, her spine locked. Guilt clawed up her throat, hot and choking, and her hands went cold. Whatever Sage was about to say would hit her where she was weakest and stay there.</p><p> </p><p>Sage looked at her with something desperate in her eyes, like she was begging to be understood. “Time moves differently there, you know?”</p><p> </p><p>No. Rio did not fucking know.</p><p> </p><p>She’d never been there. Never been allowed. Not even after death. Whatever lay beyond, it had stayed closed to her and that was absolutely the point. Sage had spoken of it, sure, but Rio had never asked. She couldn’t. Wanting to know would’ve meant wanting something from it, and she couldn’t afford that kind of weakness. Not then.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hand curled tight in the fabric of her sweatshirt, pulling hard over her chest hoping it would ease the weight pressing down on her chest. It didn’t. It sat there anyway, unmovable.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t look at Sage when she asked.</p><p> </p><p>“How long?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage ignored the question. “I could leave to collect. To walk souls.” She said it in a way that sounded like it was supposed to make it easier. Like it erased the cost.</p><p> </p><p>Rio snapped, head whipping toward her daughter so fast it was a miracle her neck didn’t break.</p><p> </p><p>She’d let hope make excuses, let it convince her to look away. And now the consequences were sitting next to her, speaking in Sage’s voice. </p><p> </p><p>For that reason alone, Rio needed it to hurt. She needed to be gutted by it.</p><p> </p><p>“How long?” Rio demanded.</p><p> </p><p>“You promised not to be upset!” Sage defended herself. “And it wasn’t even a year for you. That’s good… Right?”</p><p> </p><p>She tasted iron on her tongue- blood. Not much, just enough to remind her it was real. She dragged it slowly across her teeth, curious. It didn’t taste like it used to.</p><p> </p><p>Back when she was Death, it had been cleaner. Colder. Impersonal. It was the idea of pain, not the feeling itself. But this… this was hers. It was heat and guilt. It caught in her throat, clung to her teeth like something she couldn't wash the taste of. </p><p> </p><p>It reminded her she was alive, and she hated it.</p><p> </p><p>She tore her gaze from Sage and tried to breathe. Pressed her tongue into the inside of her cheek, hard, fighting the pull to bite down. To make it worse. To give the pain somewhere to go.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not upset,” Rio said, and it was a lie the moment it left her mouth.</p><p> </p><p>She tried again, softer this time, eyes fixed on the far end of the beach, away from Sage. “At you.” That part, at least, was true. She wasn’t angry with her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, she turned back, forcing herself to meet Sage’s eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not upset at you.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage watched Rio closely, suspicion flickering across her face.</p><p> </p><p>“Please,” Rio whispered, begging. “How long, Petal?”</p><p> </p><p>Sage swallowed hard. “Eighteen years,” she said, barely audible.</p><p> </p><p>Add that to the already endless list of reasons Rio hated threes. Clusters of them. Patterns. Triads. Cycles. Everything about that cursed number. That number never meant balance- not to her. It meant someone was always missing. It meant something had already been taken.</p><p> </p><p>Rio surged to her feet, the words spilling out before she could stop them. “I’m gonna fix this. I’m gonna take it bac-”</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s hand shot out, fingers curling around the fabric of her sleeve and yanking her straight back down into the sand.</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Sage’s voice cracked with panic. She caught her breath, seeming to steady herself before she spoke again. “Just let me finish. Okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio bared her teeth, more reflex than threat, but stayed silent. The heat behind her eyes was rising fast, but she stayed still. She didn’t speak. Didn’t move. She was holding herself together, barely.</p><p> </p><p>Sage took that as permission to keep going. “First of all, we’ve lived for much longer. Eighteen years… it’s nothing.”</p><p> </p><p>It was the way her daughter said it that unsettled Rio most. There wasn’t a flicker of resentment in Sage’s voice. Nearly two decades of peace being torn away had registered as an acceptable loss to her daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s mouth opened, protests already forming but Sage was faster.</p><p> </p><p>“Let me finish.” Her daughter’s voice was calm, but firm. Certain. And it hit like a command, not a request.</p><p> </p><p>It reminded her of Death.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s jaw snapped shut, her molars grinding together, nostrils flaring. She felt her lip curl in irritation, more out of helplessness than anger, and rolled her eyes before forcing herself to keep breathing.</p><p> </p><p>“Go on then,” Rio muttered, the words stiff and bitter, laced with a love so tangled in guilt she wasn’t sure where one ended and the other began.</p><p> </p><p>“I thought I was trapped because of what I did for you both. That I broke something and that was the punishment. But I wasn’t trapped as a consequence. I was trapped because I refused to understand.</p><p> </p><p>I was angry at the cycle. Fucking furious with it, actually. At what it did to you. To Mom. It took everything from you and still wanted more. It turned Mom’s grief into something that it could benefit from. And it never gave a shit what that cost either of you.</p><p> </p><p>I didn’t want to understand something that could do that to the people I love. But it didn’t let me go, because it understood me before I ever understood it. And it waited until I saw it clearly.</p><p> </p><p>It bent for you because it had to. You’re why it exists in the first place and it didn’t know what to do when you broke away from it. It didn’t understand what moved you. That loved moved you.</p><p> </p><p>You and Mom rewrote the laws of nature and I’m the anomaly. I wasn’t supposed to exist but I do. I’m the result of everything it couldn’t explain.</p><p> </p><p>So it came down to this- either I understood it, or I stayed stuck. And yeah, I fought it. I was stubborn as hell about it. But I did it anyway.</p><p> </p><p>So it let me go.</p><p> </p><p>Now it listens. It bends. I’ve got the power, and I can do whatever I want with it. And I’m going to be selfish about it. For you. For her. For him. For everything it took and dared to call necessary.</p><p> </p><p>It will never fucking touch my family again.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio couldn’t breathe.</p><p> </p><p>She sat frozen, hands curled into the fabric of her sweatshirt, nails biting through the seams. Her throat burned. Pressure built behind her eyes, but she didn’t dare blink. Every part of her felt too full for that.</p><p> </p><p>Sage’s words echoed through her, louder than they had any right to be.</p><p> </p><p>It wasn’t the power that stunned Rio. It was the clarity. The certainty. Sage stood in a place Rio had never reached. Not because she was too weak, but because the cycle never allowed her the space to step outside it. Rio was made to hold it together. Sage was made to break it apart.</p><p> </p><p>And she did. And she did it for them.</p><p> </p><p><em> “Salvia officinalis,” Rio murmured, her voice low, “When it blooms, it gets these little flowers, soft purples and lavenders, standing out against all that green. Like a splash of color where you least expect it.” </em> <em> Rio leaned against the crib, brushing a gentle hand over the child’s cheek. “Its common name is Sage,” she said softly. “People use it to cleanse, to heal… to save. A mix of green and purple, here with a purpose. To heal.” </em></p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t said a word. Sage was already watching her. And her daughter smiled. A quiet thing. Certain. Peace had finally arrived, and had always known its way home.</p><p> </p><p>Then, softly, her daughter spoke, “No one in history will have special treatment like you and Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a quiet huff, half amused, half bitter. Sage had twisted her old words back at her- words from a time when none of them had dared to hope. When peace had been a fantasy.</p><p> </p><p>“I promise,” Sage whispered. “You both won’t owe the universe anything anymore.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio believed her.</p><p> </p><p>The word slipped out before she knew she was saying it.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay.”</p><p> </p><p>Sage startled back slightly, more amused than offended. “Okay? That’s it?” Her small smile twisted into that shit eating grin Rio would never admit she adored.</p><p> </p><p>“Wow. Thought I’d have to be a little more convincing.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugged, still trying to collect herself. She was at a loss for words, and not many things in her long existence had left her unwillingly speechless. But she managed to ask the one question that mattered most.</p><p> </p><p>“And this... it’s forever? Your memory?” The sentence fell apart halfway through, but she knew Sage would understand.</p><p> </p><p>Sage gave a lazy shrug, completely unfazed. “Wouldn’t worry about that.”</p><p> </p><p>Of course not. Another trick. Another step ahead. Her daughter, always building safety nets before anyone realized they’d stepped off the edge. Always thinking four moves in advance, weaving protection into things no one had thought to question. That was the way she loved- with strategy, with foresight, with sacrifice she never named out loud.</p><p> </p><p>Rio let herself fall back into the sand. Her chest rose and fell like she hadn’t been breathing properly until now. </p><p> </p><p>She felt human in every way she had ever craved. Not Death. Not balance. Not the spine of some ancient natural order she never really agreed to carry.</p><p> </p><p>Just a mother. A wife. A woman with her back in the sand and the people she loved close enough to touch.</p><p> </p><p>The cycle had bent. Her daughter stood tall. Her wife was here. Her son was on the way. Her family was whole- </p><p> </p><p>“RIO VIDAL FUCKING HARKNESS!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shot upright like she’d been hit by a bolt of divine judgment. Her spine snapped straight, her eyes fixed on the stretch of ocean in front of her. She didn’t dare move. The scream echoed across the beach, distant but far too clear to pretend she hadn’t heard it. Agatha’s voice carried with vengeance on the wind.</p><p> </p><p>She realized, with growing horror, that she hadn’t said a single word before leaving. No note, no explanation, not even a dramatic goodbye. She had simply disappeared into the night like a coward with too many thoughts and not enough survival instinct.</p><p> </p><p>Her wife -her very pregnant, very hormonal, and very understandably pissed off wife- had been left behind without warning. And now she was hunting.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t just poked the bear. She had startled the bear awake, set the bear’s favorite blanket on fire, and then ran out the door with no shoes, no explanation, and absolutely no plan.</p><p> </p><p>She could already feel it rolling in- the wrath, perfectly pointed and terrifyingly efficient, crafted by the one and only Agatha Harkness. It was going to be biblical. It would come with precision, prophecy, and a terrifying sense of inevitability. This was a reckoning. Old Testament. Plagues and smiting energy.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was the Pharaoh in this scenario. The dumbass who aware of every warning sign and absolutely knew better.</p><p> </p><p>Now? The Red Sea was parting, and Rio wasn’t going to be spared.</p><p> </p><p>And yeah, she deserved it. Every fucking bit of it. </p><p> </p><p>Her daughter’s voice yanked her out of her spiral, right as she was picturing her own very well earned death.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh god. Oh god. I’m so scared. She’s so much scarier than you ever were as Death,” Sage blurted, stiff as a board, mirroring Rio’s exact posture.</p><p> </p><p>“How close is she?” Rio whispered, barely moving.</p><p> </p><p>“I’m not looking first. She’s your wife,” Sage hissed.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s your mother,” Rio shot back.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, and she doesn’t fucking remember me!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze, caught between guilt and dread. She hadn’t just left the house without a word- she was now sitting on a beach, her memories fully restored, while Agatha stood up there knowing nothing. No shared past, no context, no clue how broken it had all been. How much Rio had hurt her.</p><p> </p><p>And when it all came back, Rio would be here to see it happen.</p><p> </p><p>“She’s going to hate me,” she whispered, more to herself than to Sage. “She’s going to remember, and she’s going to hate me.”</p><p> </p><p>“No, she fucking won’t,” Sage snapped. “We already walked through that part of hell, remember?”</p><p> </p><p>They had. But this felt different.</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t know that,” Rio muttered, not bothering to hide the defeat in her voice.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, I do.” Sage stood up and yanked Rio to her feet by her sweatshirt. “Now get up, and don’t make her waddle all the way down here. You're already giving her too much time to plot both of our murders."</p><p> </p><p>She spun Rio around and gave her a push. Rio’s body jolted forward- but then stopped cold. Her eyes had locked on Agatha’s icy blues.</p><p> </p><p>She stumbled back into Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was still a ways off, standing by the car, the driver’s side door wide open behind her. Arms folded. Jaw clenched so tight Rio swore she could hear the grind from here. The swell of her belly was fully visible- clearly intentional.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was reminding Rio that it wasn't just her wife who she’d left behind.</p><p> </p><p>Their son.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s stomach turned. She was going to fucking vomit... again.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha started to waddle toward them.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned to Sage, eyes wide and pleading. Her daughter stared back, full of terrified disbelief, like she couldn’t believe Rio was still standing there.</p><p> </p><p>“Mom,” Sage hissed through gritted teeth, motioning toward the woman marching across the sand. “Go.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t have a plan. Didn’t know what she’d say, or how to even start. Her mind was panicked, scrambled, painfully human. Everything in her was spinning, but her feet carried her forward anyway.</p><p> </p><p>She needed to get to her wife. That was the only thing that made sense.</p><p> </p><p>Sage followed silently behind, keeping her distance.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was in the sand now.</p><p> </p><p>Rio met her halfway.</p><p> </p><p>She stopped a few feet away, letting herself look. Agatha’s arms were still crossed, her jaw clenched, her eyes still that icy blue. But they were rimmed in red, a little swollen. The corners of her mouth were splotchy. She had been crying.</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt her chest collapse under the sight of it. Her body sagged.</p><p> </p><p>“My love,” she breathed. The words came out small. She hadn’t meant for it to go like this. Hadn’t meant to hurt her. “I’m so sorry.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked past her, found Sage standing behind, then snapped back to Rio with a new kind of rage.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you having an affair or something?”</p><p> </p><p>The protests came like a reflex, overlapping.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh God, no!”</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck no, that’s disgusting!”</p><p> </p><p>“Stop talking,” Agatha snapped.</p><p> </p><p>Both Rio and Sage’s mouths snapped shut.</p><p> </p><p>“I checked the garden,” Agatha began, her voice level. “I checked your stupid greenhouse. My office is a disaster. There’s puke in a tiny trashcan with no lid and it reeks.” Her wife paused only to breath. “I checked everywhere and you were gone. So I drive here and find you on the beach with the same girl from yesterday. The one who had you acting completely unlike yourself. Sitting down there together like it’s fucking normal.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked at Rio.</p><p> </p><p>“Tell me. What exactly was I supposed to think?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio winced.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hadn’t raised her voice once. Her tone was calm, almost neutral. Which, in Rio’s experience, was worse than shouting. Much worse.</p><p> </p><p>“I can explain, okay?” Rio said quickly.</p><p> </p><p>“Then fucking explain,” Agatha snapped, and Rio winced again.</p><p> </p><p>“Well, um... so, funny story…”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows lifted, and Rio immediately backpedaled.</p><p> </p><p>“Not funny. Not funny at all, actually.”</p><p> </p><p>She could hear Sage groan behind her, as if this situation needed any more proof that Rio was completely fucking blowing it. She cleared her throat and tried again.</p><p> </p><p>“I was doing some light reading in your-”</p><p> </p><p>“I can show you,” Sage said, cutting in.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head. Sage stood slightly off to the side now, facing both of them. Her daughter gave her a quick glance, then looked at Agatha. Rio turned her head back just in time to see her wife take a step back, one hand moving protectively to her belly.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes were locked on Sage, wide and wild.</p><p> </p><p>Her wife wasn’t looking at Sage like a stranger. She was looking at her like a threat. Like Sage might take something from her.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s heart dropped. She knew that look. Had been on the receiving end of it centuries ago. Agatha didn’t need her memories for it to surface- some things were visceral. They outlived reason, buried themselves deep and came back whether you understood them or not.</p><p> </p><p>Now it was aimed at their daughter.</p><p> </p><p>Rio's eyes tore away from Agatha and landed on Sage.</p><p> </p><p>Terrible decision on Rio’s part.</p><p> </p><p>Sage had also taken a step back, her face pale, stricken. She looked like the truth of who she was had finally caught up with her. Like the reality of being Death had reared back and struck her daughter clean in the chest.</p><p> </p><p>“Jesus,” Rio breathed, pressing her palms hard against her eyes. This literally could not have gone any worse.</p><p> </p><p> Sage muttered, “Never mind.”</p><p> </p><p>“No,” Agatha said softly. “Show me.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio dropped her hands.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha wasn’t looking at her. Her focus was on Sage. Then something shifted. It was subtle, like a thought passed between them that didn’t need to be spoken. Whatever it was, Rio could feel it, even if she didn’t understand it.</p><p> </p><p>Sage stepped forward and closed the space between them. She reached for Agatha’s hands, and Agatha met her halfway. Gently, Sage guided them to the sides of her head.</p><p> </p><p>The first time her daughter had done this, Rio had walked in too late to stop it. She had found them locked together, heads thrown back in silent agony as Sage opened her mind. It had looked violent, unbearable, and Rio had torn them apart without thinking.</p><p> </p><p>This time was different.</p><p> </p><p>There was no strain. No tension. Sage moved with control, no longer guessing at her power but wielding it with certainty. And Agatha wasn’t resisting. Her hands rested where Sage placed them, not with fear, but with trust.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t look like a fight.</p><p> </p><p>It looked like healing.</p><p> </p><p>Rio waited. It felt like forever.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t move, didn’t blink, didn’t dare breathe too loud. All she could think -through the churn in her gut and the taste of blood on her thumb- was that Sage better have shown the whole damn story. Every inch of it. So Rio wouldn’t have to try and explain and fuck it up... Again.</p><p> </p><p>She didn’t look away from her wife. Not once. Her gaze stayed locked on Agatha’s face, then drifted to her belly, and back again. The skin at her thumb was raw from worrying it, but she couldn’t stop.</p><p> </p><p>Then Sage exhaled and slowly opened her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>Rio froze, thumb still at her mouth. Her whole body went still with a held breath.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered open with a soft gasp.</p><p> </p><p>“I told you I’ve never been much of a rule follower,” Sage said.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s hands remained where Sage had placed them, but now they cradled their daughter’s face- gentle, sure. She drew her into an embrace like she’d meant to do it for centuries.</p><p> </p><p>“You fucking idiot,” Agatha whispered, voice thick with relief.</p><p> </p><p>Sage didn’t pull away. Her words came muffled against her mother’s shoulder. “I missed you so much, mom.”</p><p> </p><p>Something in Rio broke open. Every knot in her chest came loose at once. She could breathe again. The weight lifted. The noise stopped. And there it was, quietly waiting for her- her family, whole again.</p><p> </p><p>For once, life hadn’t taken. It had given back.</p><p> </p><p>They had won.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sniffed and gently pulled away from Sage, wiping at her nose with the back of her hand. “Well,” she said, voice unsteady but trying, “that couldn’t have been more dramatic.”</p><p> </p><p>Her wife's eyes found Rio.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio braced herself for everything that could still go wrong.</p><p> </p><p>But there was no anger. No distance. Just a look so impossibly soft it nearly undid her. The blue in Agatha’s eyes shimmered, gentle and unguarded, like the tide pulling in after a long storm.</p><p> </p><p>Then Agatha rested her hand on her belly. And she smiled.</p><p> </p><p>It was the kind of smile that held a promise. One that said this time, they’d get to keep it. This time, happiness wasn’t a trick or a punishment waiting to snap shut.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stared at her, not moving, not breathing, afraid that if she blinked, it would all disappear.</p><p> </p><p>But Agatha didn’t look away.</p><p> </p><p>It was their turn now.</p><p> </p><p>And for once, it wouldn’t be touched by pain.</p><p> </p><p>Rio really wanted to kiss her wife. Desperately.</p><p> </p><p>“Alright, lovebirds,” Sage said, already turning her back and raising her hands. “I’m covering my ears. Have at it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio laughed -really laughed- and smiled so hard it ached. She could’ve wept with how grateful she felt for her daughter’s timing, her awareness. Not that Rio was about to name names, but certain teenage boys could never.</p><p> </p><p>She took three steps forward, every one of them reverent.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was waiting.</p><p> </p><p>Rio raised a hand to her cheek, thumb brushing the curve of her jaw, and the other settled gently over her stomach like it had always belonged there. She pulled Agatha in and kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>She kissed her wife like she had something to prove, and everything to give. She kissed her because she could. Because she’d get to do it again tomorrow. and the day after, and a thousand years from now.</p><p> </p><p>When Agatha finally pulled back for air, Rio chased after her, unwilling to let go. But Agatha stopped her with a thumb on her lips and a look that was far too fond.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t think you’re off the hook,” Agatha said. “You’ve got some serious groveling ahead of you.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio smiled, feeling too breathless and soft. “I’m counting on it.”</p><p> </p><p>And she meant it. Every word. She would follow Agatha Harkness across lifetimes. Through grief, through joy, through the eternity that had always belonged to them.</p><p> </p><p>For once, the future wasn’t something they had to steal or beg for.</p><p> </p><p>It was already theirs.</p><p> </p><p>And Rio knew, deep down, this time- nothing would take it from them.</p><p> </p><p>One second Agatha was smiling at her.</p><p> </p><p>The next, her hand clamped down hard on Rio’s shoulder. She hunched forward with a guttural groan.</p><p> </p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha hissed, eyes squeezing shut.</p><p> </p><p>The realization hit Rio like a bucket of ice to the face.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s happening?” she said, voice climbing as she tilted her head, trying to see Agatha’s eyes. “It’s happening. Shit! It’s happening!”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up. She shot Rio a murderous glare and opened her mouth to speak but it was immediately overtaken by another groan, this one deeper.</p><p> </p><p>“My fucking...” Agatha winced, breathing hard. “Water. Broke.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s vision began to tunnel.</p><p> </p><p>“Do not pass out right now,” Agatha barked.</p><p> </p><p>And just like that, Rio was not passing out. She was the picture of stability. Perfectly upright. Very much conscious. Probably.</p><p> </p><p>“Sage! Help me get her to the car!” Rio yelled, barely holding Agatha upright as she groaned through another contraction.</p><p> </p><p>Sage spun around and jumped into action without question.</p><p> </p><p>Between the two of them, they got Agatha into the car in one angry, breathless, and wildly uncooperative piece.</p><p> </p><p>“I can drive,” Sage offered, too eager.</p><p> </p><p>“NO,” Agatha and Rio snapped at the same time.</p><p> </p><p>Sage rolled her eyes and climbed into the back seat.</p><p> </p><p>The car had been ready for weeks. The overpacked hospital bag was already in the trunk. The car seat was locked in and judging them all with quiet confidence.</p><p> </p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>The drive to the hospital went exactly how one might expect with the three of them trapped in a car together.</p><p> </p><p>Rio gripped the wheel with white knuckled focus, driving precisely the speed limit. No faster. No slower. A picture of calm. At least on the outside.</p><p> </p><p>“Are you kidding me?” Agatha shouted, half curled in the passenger seat. “If you don’t start driving like someone’s crowning in the back seat, I will have this baby in this car, and it will be your fault.”</p><p> </p><p>“Speeding is dangerous,” Rio replied, eyes locked on the road, voice tight with concentration.</p><p> </p><p>Sage, from the back, leaned forward helpfully. “I watched a birth video on YouTube. If it comes to that, I’m, like, fully confident I could deliver him.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha turned in her seat with the slow, terrifying accuracy of a woman in pain and absolutely done with everyone’s shit, “If you so much as look between my legs, I will cut your eyeballs out.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio choked on a laugh. Sage raised her hands in surrender and dramatically sank back into the seat.</p><p> </p><p>“How did this even happen?” Agatha snapped, clutching her stomach as another contraction rolled through her.</p><p> </p><p>“Ew, don’t look at me!” Sage shouted from the back seat. “That part was very much a you and her situation!”</p><p> </p><p>“You brought me back!”</p><p> </p><p>“I didn’t tell you to celebrate!”</p><p> </p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “Can we please not fight during the miracle of life?”</p><p> </p><p>“Speed up,” Agatha growled.</p><p> </p><p>Rio loved this. Every single, unhinged second of it.</p><p> </p><p>She wouldn’t have traded it for anything.</p><p> </p><p>“You know people shit themselves during labor, right? Hope you’re ready for that,” Sage remarked casually.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s response was immediate and furious- a yell, all rage and frustration.</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>When they arrived at the hospital, Sage stayed behind in the waiting room.</p><p> </p><p>She hugged Rio tightly, whispered something into Agatha’s ear that made her wife's eyes water, and let them go.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha labored for four hours. Controlled. Fierce. Breathtaking in the way only she could be when everything hurt and she refused to break. She didn’t scream. She didn’t cry.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stayed at her side through all of it.</p><p> </p><p>Her hand was bruised to hell, fingers nearly numb from the force of Agatha’s grip, but she welcomed every second of it. It grounded her. Reminded her she was here. Not in the in between. But here.</p><p> </p><p>Rio whispered to her the whole time.</p><p> </p><p>Told her she was doing beautifully. That it was almost over. That she loved her. That she had her. That she wasn’t going anywhere.</p><p> </p><p>She reminded Agatha of the garden. Of the sky when it rained. Of the first time she’d touched her hair and realized she’d never want to stop. She said things she hadn’t planned on saying, things she didn’t even know she remembered- until they were already said.</p><p> </p><p>And when the moment finally came- </p><p> </p><p>Nicky arrived.</p><p> </p><p>He came into the world wailing, lungs strong and furious, as if he already knew exactly who his mothers were and had a thing or two to say about it. </p><p> </p><p>When the nurse placed him in Agatha’s arms, Rio felt the world shift. Felt herself change.</p><p> </p><p>She had imagined this moment a thousand different ways. All of them wrong. None of them close to this.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had never seen anything so holy in her life.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha looked down at their son and stilled. Everything in her wife softened like she had been waiting lifetimes just to hold him again. All her focus narrowed to the tiny boy in her arms, pink and squirming and perfect.</p><p> </p><p>She pulled him close, tucking her face near his, her hand cradling the back of his small, perfect head. He settled into her like he remembered her. Like he had been waiting for her too. Her lips moved with a whisper too soft to catch, something just for him, just for now, and Rio didn’t try to hear it. It wasn’t hers to have. It was theirs.</p><p> </p><p>Rio felt the ache build in her throat before she could stop it. There was no lightning crack of realization, no great voice in the sky. Just the understanding that she hadn’t been brought here to witness the end of anything. This was not death. This was not loss. This was not the balance tipping toward grief.</p><p> </p><p>This was life.</p><p> </p><p>And it belonged to her. All of it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze met Rio’s gently, and with a love that felt so impossibly wide- her wife smiled.</p><p> </p><p>Not a fleeting one, not a tight lipped one offered out of politeness or relief. It was soft and full and real, the kind of smile that lived in the corners of her blue eyes, that came from every part of her.</p><p> </p><p>“Look at what we made,” Agatha whispered.</p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t feel like Death standing at the edge of someone else’s joy. She didn’t feel like the echo of what could have been, or the consequence of love. She felt present. Real. Needed.</p><p> </p><p>This was the moment Rio had denied herself. The one she had stood apart from. The one she told herself she was too dangerous to touch.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha moved just enough to make space, her arms shifting to offer Nicky, and Rio took him without needing permission.</p><p> </p><p>He was warm and small and real in her arms. His breath hitched softly against her, and her body remembered what to do before her mind caught up. She adjusted him, held him closer, felt his fingers curl against her sweatshirt.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked at Agatha, wanting to say something, but the words didn’t come. Her throat was thick with too many years, too many versions of this moment that never came true.</p><p> </p><p>She sat carefully on the edge of the bed, easing down beside her wife with their son held close to her chest. The mattress dipped under her weight, and Agatha leaned into her without hesitation, resting her head gently against Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>Neither of them spoke at first.</p><p> </p><p>Tears slipped down Rio’s cheeks in silence. Agatha’s hand found hers, fingers brushing over her knuckles.</p><p> </p><p>Rio turned her head slightly, forehead pressing to Agatha’s temple. “I love you,” she whispered, the words catching in her throat on the way out.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s response came just as softly, “I love you more.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio let out a quiet, broken laugh that almost didn’t sound like laughter at all. “Not possible.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn’t argue. She just hummed, low and content, and kept her head resting against Rio’s.</p><p> </p><p>“Here comes trouble,” Agatha murmured.</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio could ask what she meant, the door creaked open and Sage peeked her head in, eyes scanning the room with cautious curiosity. Agatha lifted a hand and waved her in, beckoning without a word.</p><p> </p><p>Sage stepped inside, quieter than usual, but no less herself. She approached the hospital bed where both her mothers sat, her expression unreadable.</p><p> </p><p>“I hate that this is the first thing I have to ask-”</p><p> </p><p>“No, I didn’t shit myself,” Agatha cut in smoothly, the exhaustion in her voice barely covering the smirk. Even Rio could hear it.</p><p> </p><p>Sage pressed her lips together, clearly trying not to laugh. She nodded with mock seriousness. “Good. Solid start.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha tilted her head toward the bundle in Rio’s arms. “You want to hold your brother?”</p><p> </p><p>There was no flicker of fear or awkward deflection. Just a quiet, “Sure.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s chest ached in the best way. She shifted slightly and guided Nicky into Sage’s waiting arms.</p><p> </p><p>Sage held him with surprising ease. She looked down at him with a quiet sort of pride, her brow furrowed in thought. Then, after a beat, she smirked.</p><p> </p><p>“Man, sucks you’re not as cute as I was.”</p><p> </p><p>Nicky squirmed softly in her arms, completely unaware of the challenge he had just inherited.</p><p> </p><p>Sage leaned in just a little, whispering under her breath. “Not so smug now, huh? Told you we’d fix it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio blinked at that, and for a second, her heart stuttered. It didn’t matter that the baby couldn’t understand. Sage wasn’t talking to him like a stranger. She was talking to someone she already knew.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>Four. A shape you could stand in. Completely whole.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p> </p><p>Once upon a time, Agatha Harkness found herself wishing for another year.</p><p> </p><p>Not for immortality. Not for eternity. Just a year. One full turn of the earth, one imperfect stretch of months where things grew and changed and died- and maybe, if the universe was kind, came back again.</p><p> </p><p>She wanted every part of it. The spring rains that softened the ground. The summer heat that made the days feel long and unruly. The crispness of fall, and the silence of winter. She wanted the mundane, the messy, the ordinary magic of waking up and realizing she had made it to another morning.</p><p> </p><p>And now she had it.</p><p> </p><p>She wasn’t waiting for the next tragedy.</p><p> </p><p>She was living the wish.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha didn't despise the seasons anymore. Because she knew now that spring would come. That summer would follow. That fall would ask her to let go, and winter would ask her to rest. And still, she'd stay. She’d wake up. She’d laugh. She’d curse. She’d fight. She’d hold on to everything she loved and let the rest slip away.</p><p> </p><p>Because the point was never to stop the turning.</p><p> </p><p>The point was that this time, she got to turn with it.</p><p> </p><p>“MOM!”</p><p> </p><p>It ripped Agatha from her thoughts. She ran to the living room, heart pounding, ready for anything- except this.</p><p> </p><p>Nicky, ten months old and giggling like a maniac, sat in the middle of the rug, swinging Brucie over his head in wide, gleeful circles. The snake flailed through the air, occasionally slapping the floor.</p><p> </p><p>Sage sat frozen on the couch, horrified, eyes wide as she gasped at Agatha, “You’re just gonna let him do this?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio walked by with a bag of chips, didn’t even glance at what was unfolding. “The snake deserves it.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha laughed so hard she nearly cried.</p><p> </p><p>Brucie, still airborne, did not.</p>
