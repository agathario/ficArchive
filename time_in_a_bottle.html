<p>
<strong>Spring 2025</strong>
</p><p>Alice had been planning this trip for a while. It had originally been with her ex, but when they broke up Rio found herself drafted in. They got a train in Boston that took them up through Massachusetts, heading to the northeast point of the state.</p><p>Rio looked out of the window, the sharp morning sun glaring against the windows as they passed through small towns, fields and woodlands. It was certainly a pretty view.</p><p>“I emailed ahead and the lady at the bed and breakfast said we could leave our stuff there until we check in,” Alice explained. “That way we can make the most of our day!”</p><p>“Surely there can’t be that much to see,” Rio argued. “It’s not a huge town.”</p><p>“We also don’t want to rush.”</p><p>No, they certainly wouldn’t want that, Rio thought miserably. Despite being a self-proclaimed dabbler in the dark arts, she didn’t like tourist traps, and from all the videos Alice had sent her on TikTok, to her it seemed Salem, Massachusetts had become just that.</p><p>She hoped it wouldn’t be too busy, but they hadn’t gone in the autumn, and she hoped the unreliable weather would deter those planning a spontaneous long weekend. Rio hated crowds, hated people in general, besides a handful of exceptions. Her travel companion being one of them.</p><p>The only reason had agreed to this trip was because she knew it was a personal visit for Alice. Her mother had been something of a rock and roll legend, her most famous song being ‘the Ballad of the Witches Road’, a twist on an old folksong some linked to infamous Salem witches, and the horrors that befell them. Alice had spent much of her childhood visiting Salem as her mother’s career dwindled, singing the song for locals and tourists alike.</p><p>Lorna Wu had died when Alice was eight, but the song never seemed to leave her, and it seemed neither did Salem. Rio didn’t know why she waited so long to go back, but she wasn’t going to let her best friend go through this alone.</p><p>Once the train reached the station, they grabbed their bags and headed out into the town. They had booked to stay for two nights, planning to take the evening train back to Boston at the end of their third day before returning to New York the following morning. Rio had packed light, but Alice had decided to bring the biggest duffle she could find.</p><p>“It looks like you’re transporting a body,” Rio commented as they hailed down a cab.</p><p>“I wanted to make sure I had enough room for souvenirs.”</p><p>“What are you going to do? Bring a witch home with you?”</p><p>“I don’t need to. I already have you.”</p><p>Rio mocked a laugh as the climbed into the cab, greeting the driver as Alice gave him the address.</p><p>Much to Rio’s delight, the town seemed the perfect amount of peaceful and quirky. She spotted some tourists, mostly taking pictures by the Bewitched statue, but most people were just there carrying on with their normal days.</p><p>Soon, the driver turned a corner, carrying on until he pulled up in front of a large house on a quiet stretch of road. Alice paid for the cab while Rio got their luggage out, and soon they were both stood staring up at their lodgings.</p><p>Though freshly painted a bright yellow, Rio could tell the house was old. From the small windows to the symmetrical façade, she could imagine it stood there when the roads were mere dirt tracks, when horses passed instead of cars, and when people walked the streets in long coats and frilled dresses, freshly settled in the new world.</p><p>“I read about the history,” Alice explained. “It was built before the witch trials, so whoever used to live here might have seen it all.”</p><p>“Do you think it’s haunted?” Rio asked. “I hate ghosts.”</p><p>“I’m sure it’s fine,” Alice assured as the climbed the wooden steps to the front door. “It has good reviews.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t bothered looking where they were staying. From the way Alice talked, they wouldn’t be spending much time there. Their itinerary was completely stacked. So stacked she reckoned they’d need witchcraft to schedule it all in. Still, she imagined the décor of their lodgings would match with its colonial exterior but instead found herself walking onto the set of <em>Charmed</em>. Crystals, candles and carnations covered the surfaces of the entrance hall, the walls covered in artwork of portraits and landscapes, each as dramatic as the last. </p><p>Footsteps sounded from the other room, and a woman appeared. “Oh, hello there. Welcome to The Captain’s Inn. I’m guessing you two are those nice girls from New York?”</p><p>“We are,” Alice confirmed as they followed the woman to the front desk. “Alice Wu-Gulliver and...”</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” their host finished for her, and Rio found her name strange on the woman’s tongue. “It’s a pleasure to have you both here. My name is Lilia Calderu, and I’m here to help you with whatever you need.”</p><p>Lilia was an older woman, her grey hair tied up in a messy bun, escaping ringlets framing her face. She wore a yellow silk shawl over a lavender dress, with sporadically placed sequins shimmering in the light. A total GILF if Rio said so herself. </p><p>“Can we leave our bags somewhere?” Alice asked. “We have a lot we want to get done today.”</p><p>“You can leave them in your rooms,” Lilia insisted. “I made sure they were ready for when you arrived.”</p><p>Following Lilia upstairs, Alice playfully elbowed Rio in the side. “This is much better than we planned.”</p><p>Rio nodded. She was relieved she’d have all the checking-in nonsense over with, but as she walked up through the old, eccentric house she wondered what this experience would be like.</p><p>“You know, Rio,” Lilia spoke up. “I was surprised to see your name on the booking. Did you know this house was home to a Captain Vidal?”</p><p>“Really?” </p><p>“Yes, the Captain and his wife lived here for a while. Not long, but enough to put their own mark on the house and its history. Are they perhaps a relative of yours?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio answered, catching Alice giving her a concerned look. “It’s cool though.”</p><p>They reached the landing, and Lilia led them to the room at the very end. </p><p>“This is your room, Rio.”</p><p>To Rio’s surprise, their room was pretty ordinary. More in line with the colonial style, with a simple iron bedframe and the walls painted an off-white. Her bathroom was in what she guessed had been a cupboard or closet, with an antique wooden wardrobe taking its place across the room. Above her bed was a framed painting of a tree, crooked and bare. Alice rushed over to look at it. </p><p>“Isn’t that the Lightening Tree?”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Lightening Tree?”</p><p>“An old folk tale,” Lilia said dismissively. “You can see it if you visit the Burying Point.”</p><p>“We are,” Alice confirmed. “It’s on our itinerary. Today, we are...”</p><p>Rio didn’t listen to Alice’s rambles. She had heard their day’s plan too many times to take any notice of it. Instead, her attention gravitated elsewhere. To a small portrait hung up on the wall above an old dresser. One of a young woman. A face from centuries ago.</p><p>Her face was striking, with deep blue eyes and a sharp jaw, while wild brown waves cascading over her shoulders and out of the frame. What looked like a cameo necklace hung around her neck, the pendant resting against the purple material of a colonial dress. To many, the portrait would have seemed haunting. To Rio, the woman was simply beautiful. </p><p>“I see you’ve met the lady of the house,” Lilia spoke up. “Captain Vidal’s wife.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but feel a little jealous. That this Vidal, someone with her name yet none of her baggage, had managed to get themselves a gorgeous wife. She could picture him, gross and bald with wooden teeth, likely too old and disgusting to be married to such a vision. </p><p>“What was her name?”</p><p>“We’re unsure,” Lilia admitted. “I have a member of the local historical society looking into it. We only know who she was because of the inscription on the back.”</p><p>“Do you have a portrait of Captain Vidal?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Somewhere,” Lilia replied, before clapping her hands together. “Right, follow me to your room, Alice.”</p><p>Rio had all but three minutes peace before Alice returned, ready to begin their itinerary.</p><p>“Come on, we have so much to do!”</p><p>Rio grumbled as she grabbed what she needed and headed out of her room, stealing one last glance at the portrait before she went. </p><p> </p><p>The Witch House was interesting, Rio had to admit, but after the <em>third</em> museum she’d had enough.</p><p>“Alice, please can we do something else now?”</p><p>“But this museum...”</p><p>“No, somewhere outdoors.” </p><p>“Fine, let’s go to the Burying Point, but we’re coming back to this another time.”</p><p>Alice led her through the streets, and soon enough they were stood at the entrance of an old cemetery. Grey headstones lined the lawn, same stood to attention while others leaned and slanted, threatening to fall flat on the grass. At the entrance, there was a sign.</p><p align="center">
<strong>THE BURYING POINT</strong>
</p><p align="center">
<strong>1637</strong>
</p><p align="center">
<strong>Oldest Buring Ground in the City of Salem</strong>
</p><p>Underneath was a list of the notable people buried there: a reverend, a governor, a chief justice, a captain who arrived on the Mayflower, but the only mention of the witch trials was Justice John Hathorne of ‘the witchcraft court’<em>.</em></p><p>Rio frowned. “So, the victims aren’t buried here?”</p><p>“They aren’t buried anywhere,” Alice explained. “Just thrown away, but some suspect they were buried in secret by their families.”</p><p>They found the grave of John Hathorne, the original headstone encased in a more modern stone structure. It was a simple inscription, but letters seemed to bounce about everywhere and the skull carved above it was enough to give even Rio the creeps. Alice stood over it for a while, her face set in a deep frown.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Rio asked her.</p><p>“Do you think we’d have been accused of witchcraft?”</p><p>“Probably. Well, maybe you could play it cool, but they’d think I was possessed or something.”</p><p>“No, I mean because we’re gay. We’d probably have had to marry men to…”</p><p>Rio gagged. “Nope.”</p><p>That got Alice to smile. “So you’d be the scary spinster?”</p><p>“Nah, I’d keep up my androgyny and marry a woman.”</p><p>“Don’t think that would work.”</p><p>“It would,” Rio insisted. “No one would ever know. Well, besides my darling wife, but she wouldn’t complain.”</p><p>Alice shook her head and looked down at the headstone. “Come on. Let’s go look somewhere else.”</p><p>They walked through the cemetery, looking at the inscriptions. They were old, older than the United States old. It made Rio feel weird thinking she shared a space with someone who had lived so long ago, even if they were just grizzle and bone. Alice kept pointing out things, from interesting graves to a large oak called ‘The Mother Tree’. It seemed her friend knew everything, while Rio was struggling to keep up.</p><p>“Here’s the Lightening Tree,” Alice pointed to a twisted oak and took off towards it. Rio followed, stopping beside Alice as they both stared up at the tree. It looked pretty ordinary to her, all besides a sheered scar along its trunk.</p><p>Alice pointed to one of the graves. “Caleb Pickman was struck by lightning and was buried next to the tree. Before that, the tree had never been struck by lightning. Since, it’s been struck twice!”</p><p>“Shit that’s bad luck.” Rio walked up to the tree, marvelling at its striking beauty. While Rio loved flowers and plants, she also loved trees. Especially old ones that stood the test of time. She reached out to feel the rough bark, only to flinch back at the slightest of touches.</p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>“What?” Alice asked.</p><p>“Nothing.” Rio shook her hand out. “Just static.”</p><p>They walked around the memorial close by, before Alice said she fancied looking round some shops. Alice liked little independent stores, with unique items and cool vibes. Rio liked random knickknacks and dumb t-shirts. Most of the shops suited Alice’s preferences, but Rio did get a witch bobblehead and a pin that said ‘big witch energy’ that she’d pinned to her jacket.</p><p>They entered a small shop filled with candles and crystals, with the smell of burnt lavender filling the air. It was lighter than the other stores, most things a shade of pink, from rose quarts to salt lamps.</p><p>“Hey,” the woman behind the counter greeted them, though Rio saw her eyes instantly locking on to Alice. “How are we both today?”</p><p>“Great,” Alice said with a smile. “We’re sightseeing!”</p><p>“Ah, first time in Salem?”</p><p>“Not mine, but it’s Rio’s first time.”</p><p>Rio pretended to look at a carousel of crystal necklaces, trying to hide her smirk. She was definitely getting a vibe.</p><p>“You must like it if you keep coming back,” the woman commented. “I’m Jen, by the way.”</p><p>“Alice, and yes, I love it. My mom used to perform here a lot when I was a kid, but it’s been years.”</p><p>“Really, who’s your mom?”</p><p>“Lorna Wu.”</p><p>“What?!” Jen gasped. “Your mom is Lorna Wu! She’s like a local legend! They’ve opened a bar called The Witches’ Road, you know.”</p><p>“They have?”</p><p>“Yeah, why don’t you both come tonight? I’ll be there around seven-ish?”</p><p>“That sounds awesome. Right, Rio?”</p><p>Rio saw both women look at her hopefully, and she accepted her role as third wheel with a nod. “Sounds fun.”</p><p>“Great,” Jen grinned. “I’ll see you then.”</p><p>“See you then!” Alice grabbed Rio’s arm and dragged her out of the shop. Once they were out, Alice linked arms with her excitedly. “I wasn’t seeing things, right?”</p><p>“She asked you out in 2.5 seconds. What do you think?”</p><p>Alice squealed excitedly. “This is the best place ever!”</p><p>Rio chuckled. This was shaping to be Alice’s dream vacation.</p><p> </p><p>Later, they both changed and headed out on the town. They had always planned to go out, but Alice had gone into panic mode. Rio was surprised she hadn’t worn down the carpet between their rooms with the way she was back and forth checking if she looked okay. Eventually they were ready, and Lilia waved them off, promising to wait up for them.</p><p>“She’s a good host,” Alice had commented, and Rio nodded in agreement.</p><p>They made it to the bar and Rio had to admit it was pretty cool. Everything had a very 70s witchy vibe, and there were pictures of Lorna everywhere. Tour posters, framed vinyls, even what looked like a signed photo behind the bar. The coolest thing, however, was the painted mural on the back walk of Lorna holding a microphone, likely singing the song for which the bar got its name.</p><p>Rio looked to Alice and saw her friend’s eyes were wide with awe. Yep, that made the whole trip worth it.</p><p>They found Jen sat at a booth, and Rio didn’t miss the way she lit up when she saw Alice.</p><p>“Hey, you two,” she said as they slid onto the bench opposite her. “Did you find the place okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, Google helped,” Alice admitted. “Do you want me to go get some drinks?”</p><p>“I’ll get us some,” Rio offered. “What do you want? Beer?”</p><p>Alice nodded.</p><p>“What about you Jen?”</p><p>“The same please, Rio.”</p><p>Rio gave her a finger salute before heading to the bar. She wanted to let them have some alone time. Alice deserved to be happy. She was a people person, who thrived on loving and being loved in return.</p><p>As for Rio, well, she didn’t think that was meant for her. Sure, she’d tried dating, but she never had that kind of connection with anyone. Not really. Alice told her the right person would come along when she least expected it, but she decided not to spend her life hoping for something that may never happen.</p><p>The guy behind the bar asked for her order and seemed pleased that it was pretty simple. Rio paid and waited for him to get the bottles. Yet as she did, a strange tingling sensation prickled at her fingers. She rubbed her hands together, but still the tingling continued. Just the fingers on her right hand, more prominent at the tips. She frowned, studying the skin for herself. It looked fine. No redness or blotchiness. Still, the tingling was becoming more and more uncomfortable, travelling up nerve endings to create a sharp sensation in her chest.</p><p>“Here you go.”</p><p>Rio looked up to see the bartender had placed the three beers on the bar before her. Just like that, the tingling was gone.</p><p>“Thanks.” She picked them all up and carried them over, sliding back into the booth.</p><p>“Thanks Rio,” Jen said politely. “How much do I owe you?”</p><p>“Nothing,” she insisted. “So, what are we talking about?”</p><p>“Alice was just telling me all about her being a mall cop,” Jen answered, to which Alice chuckled.</p><p>“I <em>was</em> a mall cop,” she corrected. “Now I work for Rio.”</p><p>“Or really?” Jen’s eyes shifted to Rio again. “What do you do?”</p><p>“I own a flower shop back in New York. It started small but now I’m doing well enough to have Alice work for me.”</p><p>“She’s the best boss,” Alice said with a grin. “She buys me lunch every day.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I try my best.”</p><p>“So you two have known each other a while?” Jen asked, and Alice nodded.</p><p>“College roommates.”</p><p>“Met the first day of freshman year and have been inseparable ever since,” Rio added. “Kind of cliché when you think about it.”</p><p>“Terribly,” Alice agreed. “But then again, who else would put up with you?”</p><p>“Who indeed.”</p><p>Jen looked between them with an amused smile. “You two are adorable.”</p><p>“What about you, Jen?” Rio asked between swigs of her beer. “What brought you to Salem?”</p><p>“I moved here with a friend of mine. I set up the shop on a whim, and it’s done really well. The revenue in October pretty much sets me through for the year so the rest is just lovely extras.”</p><p>“I bet October is like Woodstock round here,” Alice commented. “That’s why we decided to come out of season.”</p><p>“It is, but there’s a lot of fun stuff going on, and it’s great for local trade. Maybe you two should come back then? We could all go to the events together.”</p><p>Alice grinned, and Rio knew they’d be back in Salem every other weekend from now on.</p><p>Two drinks and some interesting conversations later, Rio decided her third wheel duty was complete.</p><p>“I’m going to go,” Rio told them. “I want to get some sleep ready for tomorrow.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Alice questioned. “I can come with you.”</p><p>“No, you have fun,” Rio insisted. “Text me if you need me to come meet you.”</p><p>“I’ll make sure she gets back okay,” Jen promised. “I can call you a cab if you want?”</p><p>“I can handle myself,” Rio answered. The bar wasn’t too far from the B&amp;B anyway. “Let me know when you’re back.”</p><p>“As long as <em>you</em> text me when you get there.” Alice moved forward and gave Rio a hug. “Thank you.”</p><p>“Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do,” she whispered into Alice’s hair, earning a playful swat on the arm as they pulled apart. “See you both later.”</p><p>She left them in the booth, stealing a glance back when she reached the door. She couldn’t see Jen, but Alice’s glowing grin was there for all to see. Rio smiled to herself, before walking alone into the night.</p><p>She messaged Alice as she walked through the doors of the B&amp;B, letting her know she was back. Rio wasn’t expecting a response. In fact, she hoped Alice would rock up sometime in the morning wearing the same clothes and a guilty smile on her face.</p><p>She was about to head upstairs when Lilia appeared in the doorway to the living area.</p><p>“I thought you youngsters stayed out until the sun came up,” she teased. “Where’s Alice?”</p><p>“She’s met someone so I’m giving her space.”</p><p>Lilia nodded in understanding. “Fancy a night cap?”</p><p>“Sure.” Rio followed her through to the living room. It was quite cosy, with crush velvet sofas and scented candles burning around the room.</p><p>“Do you drink whiskey?” Lilia asked as she walked over to a gold drinks cart in the corner.</p><p>“I do,” Rio answered as she perched on one of the couches. Lilia returned with two crystal glasses filled with copper liquid. She handed one to Rio before taking a seat opposite her.</p><p>“So how are you liking Salem?”</p><p>“It’s good,” Rio answered. “It was more a trip for Alice, and I’m glad she’s having a good time.”</p><p>“She seems to be having a very interesting time. Who’s caught her eye in town?”</p><p>“Some lady who owns a shop. Jen.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “Oh I know Jen.”</p><p>Rio was instantly worried. “What’s she like?”</p><p>“One of the best people I’ve ever met,” Lilia assured. “Your friend is in good hands.”</p><p>Rio quickly relaxed. “Yeah, she seems cool.”</p><p>“Now, that’s a pretty necklace.”</p><p>Rio reached up to her neck and felt the gold and emerald ring resting below her collar bone. Usually, it was well hidden under whatever shirt she was wearing, but it had accidentally made an outward appearance.</p><p>“Thanks, it was my mom’s.”</p><p>Lilia nodded in understanding. “I never knew my mother. I was raised by…I think you’d probably call it a convent, but it wasn’t. Back in Sicily.”</p><p>“You’re Sicilian?”</p><p>Lilia nodded. “But I’ve lived here many years.”</p><p>Rio took a sip of her whisky. “How did you end up here?”</p><p>“It’s a long story,” Lilia dismissed.</p><p>“I have time,” Rio answered.</p><p>Lilia smiled. “Okay, well I’m named after my ancestor. She came here at the birth of the American colonies, and lived here in Salem.”</p><p>“What happened to her?”</p><p>Lilia shrugged. “All I know is she made it back to Sicily eventually. I don’t know. I feel like she had unfinished business here. I’m very in tuned with the past, and the future. The present alludes me a little, but I know I need to be here.”</p><p>Rio studied her curiously. “Are you a psychic?”</p><p>“I am,” Lilia nodded. “I can read cards, palms, all that fun stuff. Care for a reading?”</p><p>“How much is it going to cost me?”</p><p>“Not a dime.” Lilia held out her hand. “Come on.”</p><p>Rio sighed and gave her hand to her host. Lilia studied her palm. “Well, your heart line is strong, which is no surprise.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes flicked up to meet hers, before looking back down again. “And your head line tells me you’re going to make some decisions soon, but you’re smarter than you think. You’ve just got to trust yourself.”</p><p>“No way you got that from a line.”</p><p>“I’m just that good,” Lilia insisted, before gasping. “Oh, you lucky girl.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Your marriage line is quite profound. You’re going to meet your spouse very soon.”</p><p>“Marriage?” Rio said in disbelief. “I don’t even believe in marriage.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “I think that’s about to change, my dear.”</p><p>Rio decided not to argue. It was all a magic trick, anyway. No better than pulling a rabbit out of a hat.</p><p>Lilia brought Rio’s hand up, peering closer. “Now this is interesting.”</p><p>“Is it telling me how many kids I’ll have?” Rio joked, but Lilia didn’t bite. Instead, her face set in a deep frown.</p><p>“Your life line…I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s like…it’s like it’s going back on itself. No, beyond itself. Going back to before it began.”</p><p>“But that’s not possible,” Rio told her. “Unless it’s like a metaphorical thing, right?”</p><p>“Right.” Lilia let go of her hand and put on a smile. “I’m going to go watch one of my shows in the lounge. Feel free to stay in here as long as you like.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Thanks for the drink.”</p><p>Lilia’s smile turned genuine. “You’re very welcome, my dear.”</p><p>Rio watched her go before downing the rest of her drink. She’d had a good day, but it was time to call it a night.</p><p>Once in her room, she quickly changed into a nightshirt and brushed her teeth. She’d shower in the morning, freshen up and be prepared for Alice to go on about witches and history (and probably Jen too). That night, however, she sat on her bed and stared at the paintings on the walls.</p><p>The Lightning Tree was striking. Sure, that Mother Tree Alice had pointed out was more aesthetically pleasing, but there was something about that Lightning Tree that just…called to her?</p><p>She flexed her fingers, trying to get rid of the tingling that had returned and refused to leave. It was probably something up with her nerves. Maybe when she got static off the Lightening Tree, it had irritated them in some way, and she just had to wait for them to calm down.</p><p>Tearing her attention away form the tree, she moved to look at the portrait. Mrs Captain Vidal was as beautiful in the dim manufactured light as she was in the day. In fact, somehow the darkness made her more striking, something Rio hadn’t thought was possible.</p><p>Her mind drifted to Alice and how easily she had found someone who’s face lit up for her in such a short time after meeting. Maybe for some people they were so undeniably loveable that stuff like that just happened to them without even trying. Rio wondered if Mrs Vidal was like that, or if she found it hard like she did.</p><p>That was doubtful. With a face like that, she’d have the whole Colony of Massachusetts on its knees.</p><p>Rio went to lie in bed and stared up at the ceiling. She imagined being in her flower shop one day when Mrs Vidal walked in, in modern attire and a fond smile on her lips. They’d talk about flowers for so long, they’d lose track of the day, and in the end, would Rio have no choice but to ask this beautiful lady to dinner.  Dinner would turn into breakfast, then lunch, then dinner again. And again. And again.</p><p>It was a fantasy, a nice one that made Rio smile, but it would never be true.</p><p>Her phone dinged, and Rio quickly checked it.</p><p>
<strong>ALICE</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Back!</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>How was it?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>ALICE</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Magical.</em>
</p><p>Rio chuckled, contemplating getting up to get the gossip, but decided it could wait until morning. Switching off the light, she turned on her side and allowed herself to sleep.</p><p>
<em>Rio ran through the Burying Point, weaving through the graves, almost tripping over her long skirt as she went.</em>
</p><p>
<em>She could hear the voices getting closer.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Witch! Witch! Witch!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio ran faster, yet the voices just got closer and closer.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Witch! Witch! Witch!”</em>
</p><p>
<em>She raced towards the Lightening Tree, her hand held out ready to touch it. Just a little further.</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio!” Another voice called. “Please, my love.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Her hand made contact with the tree, and suddenly she was falling.</em>
</p><p>Rio woke with a start, gasping for air. Her room was dark, bathed in an early morning twilight. She checked her phone. It was just past five am. Soon the sun would rise, and she could continue with her day. But she couldn’t.</p><p>The tingling had gotten worse.</p><p>She thought back to when it started. When she touched that damn tree. The tree from her dream. The tree painted above her head. The tree that even in her wakefulness called for her in a way she couldn’t describe.</p><p>Rio would never be sure if it was desperation or foolishness that got her out of bed, or changing into a t-shirt and jeans, or pulling on her boots and jacket. Perhaps it was a combination of both, too powerful for her to resist.</p><p>She crept downstairs, and on a whim, she tried the front door and found it unlocked. Had Lilia forgotten about it the night before? That whiskey had certainly been strong. Rio decided not to question it and stepped out into the night.</p><p>She’d brought her phone for directions, but somehow she just knew the way. Like it called to her, leading her through the quiet streets. The cemetery was shut, of course, but Rio hadn’t led the most innocent of youths and climbed over the fence with ease.</p><p>Even in the dark, she could make out the tree, a dark twisted shadow against the grey sky. She approached with caution, then determination, before her nerves crept up on her again.</p><p>Why had she come here?</p><p>What was happening to her?</p><p>And what was so special about this goddamn tree?</p><p>She stopped before it, staring up at the twisting branches stretching out like crooked fingers clawing at the sky. Taking in a deep breath, she slowly reached out for the trunk. Her hand stopped just before it, and she took a moment to decide what she was going to do. It was her last chance to walk away, to head back and wait for Alice to wake up. To hear all about her night with Jen over breakfast before going to explore the local area as they had planned. Yet a part of her, somewhere deep inside, told her she couldn’t. She had to do this.</p><p>And so, with one last gulp of air, Rio pressed her palm against the tree. A loud crack cut through the air, a bright light, a sharp sensation running through her like a knife.</p><p>Then, she was falling.</p><p>She wasn’t sure how long the fall lasted, whether moments or hours. All she knew was she hit the ground with a heavy thump, the air knocked from her lungs. Gasping to catch her breath, she managed to sit up.</p><p>It was dark, darker than before, almost too dark to see her surroundings. The air was different too. Cleaner, fresher, sharper. She reached for her phone and saw it was still early morning, but she had no bars. No Wi-Fi. Nothing.  Rio frowned. Surely the signal in Salem couldn’t be that spotty?</p><p>Light appeared before her, and Rio squinted through the darkness as it approached. As it grew nearer, she could make out a cloaked figure moving along with it. Rio scrambled backwards, her body pressing against cool stone. A headstone, she guessed. Her hands reached back to clutch it, watching as the figure got closer and closer.</p><p>It stopped before her, looming above like a dark shadow. It was then she realised the light was a lantern, fire burning within. The figure raised it upwards, revealing the sharp face of a young woman, a mischievous smirk playing on her lips.</p><p>“Well, well,” the woman spoke as she pulled the hood from her head. “What have we here?”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio looked up at the woman. She wasn’t particularly tall, but her looming figure made her seem towering. She wore a long dark cloak over what appeared to be a simple dress that also brushed the ground, the true colour obscured by the darkness and orange hue of the lantern’s flame. Dark hair fell to her shoulders, wild and untamed. Her face was sharpened by the shadows, from her long nose to her strong jaw, yet her eyes were as clear as day. Blue. The bluest blue she had ever seen.</p><p>There was also an odd familiarity to her. Rio couldn’t quite put her finger on it. Perhaps she had seen her in a crowd or passed her in the street, but she swore she would instantly recall such a face if she saw it. Still, in her vulnerable state, the woman’s striking appearance made whatever admiration she had turn to vexation.</p><p>“Who are you?” Rio demanded as she got to her feet. “What the fuck are you doing dressed like that?”</p><p>The woman chuckled as she looked Rio up and down. “I could say the same to you.”</p><p>“Me? What’s wrong with what I’m wearing?” </p><p>The woman just scoffed. “Where did you come from?”</p><p>“I’m staying at the Captain’s Inn.”</p><p>“I don’t know of such a place.”</p><p>“Well maybe you don’t know everything.”</p><p>With that, Rio moved past the woman, barging her shoulder as she went. Switching on her phone light, she navigated her way back towards the fence.</p><p>An orange glow soon appeared from behind her. “You can’t go out there looking like that.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because a year ago they were hunting witches and you’re walking around like sin on legs.”</p><p>Rio frowned. It was just a t-shirt and jeans. Not even one of her subtle innuendo shirts. This woman was so weird, and that was coming from her. </p><p>“Why do you care?”</p><p>“You know why. I saw what happened.”</p><p>“Enlighten me then, because I have no...”</p><p>Rio stopped.</p><p>She could now make out the street, the twilight tilting towards dawn. Only the street was not as she had left it. The buildings had changed, the road had gone, and there was not a single sign of modern life in sight.</p><p>“Where am I?” she demanded, facing the woman once more. “Is this one of those reenactment places?”</p><p>“A reenactment of what?” the woman questioned. “You’re in Salem Town, not far from the dock.”</p><p>“Don’t lie to me!” Rio snapped. “I was just in Salem. It looked nothing like this!”</p><p>“Well I was born here,” the woman countered, her head held high, “and I assure you, I know this town like the back of my hand. This<em> is</em> Salem.”</p><p>“You want to play games, huh? Fine.” Rio folded her arms. “Who’s the president?”</p><p>The woman frowned. “President?”</p><p>“Yes, who is it?”</p><p>“I don’t know what that is.”</p><p>This woman was a good actress, Rio would give her that.</p><p>“Fine, what year is this?”</p><p>“What year do you think it is?” the woman threw back.</p><p>“2025,” Rio answered, and watched as the woman’s eyes widened. “What?”</p><p>“That’s impossible. That’s over three hundred years away.”</p><p>“What year do you think it is?”</p><p>“1693,” the woman answered without hesitation.</p><p>Rio sighed. “Enough with the act. Did Alice put you up to this?”</p><p>“No one put me up to anything,” the woman snapped. “You’re the one playing games.”</p><p>“Me?!” Rio gasped. “What did I do?!”</p><p>The woman stepped closer. “You know exactly what you did.”</p><p>“No, I really don’t”</p><p>“Liar,” the woman spat. “I saw the lightning. I saw you appear.”</p><p>“Lightning?” Rio frowned. “There wasn’t...”</p><p>The crack. The flash. The sharp sensation shooting through her. </p><p>She clasped her hand against her forehead. “Oh my God, the Lightning Tree!”</p><p>“The what?” the woman frowned. </p><p>“The lightning tree. It...I touched it and suddenly my hand wouldn’t stop tingling and I-I had to go back because I had this dre-”</p><p>The woman covered Rio’s mouth. “Don’t say any more. Not here.”</p><p>Rio tried to argue, but the woman’s had muffled her words.</p><p>“Come with me,” she instructed. “I know where we can go. Just keep behind me, in the shadows.”</p><p>Rio didn’t want to follow her. She didn’t trust her, but she didn’t trust any of this, and so she had no choice. She followed the woman out of the cemetery and through the streets of the town. She recognised a few buildings from the day before, but most were different. Wooden structures, new but imperfectly made. The streets were quiet, apart from the occasional barking dog or drunken shout echoing from afar. Otherwise, it was perfectly still.</p><p>“The dockers will be up soon,” the woman warned. “They can’t see you like that.”</p><p>“But how...” Before Rio could finish, the woman hoped a small fence and stole a sheet that had been left on a line. She threw it at her. </p><p>“Wrap that around yourself.”</p><p>“That’s stealing!”</p><p>“If they didn’t want it taking, they shouldn’t have left it out at night. To me, it’s fair game.”</p><p>Rio wrapped the sheet around herself and followed the woman down the street. “What’s your name?”</p><p>“What’s yours?” the woman countered. Rio gritted her teeth. This woman was insufferable.</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>“Rio what?”</p><p>“Rio Vidal.”</p><p>The woman hummed. “What a strange name.”</p><p>“Well? What’s yours?”</p><p>“Agatha,” the woman replied. “Agatha Harkness.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha led her to a small wooden cottage on the edge of town, shallow in the forest, but enough to be obscured from prying eyes. While the young woman walked confidently to the door, Rio trailed cautiously behind. She felt numb, dazed, but mostly confused.</p><p>How had she ended up here? How had Salem changed so much? But most of all, she wanted to know why this woman was so set on helping her?</p><p>Agatha knocked on the door in a unique rhythm, before glancing back to Rio with a smirk. “She’ll know it’s me.”</p><p>The door soon opened, and an older woman appeared from behind it. Rio blinked, wondering if her eyes were playing tricks on her, but no. Despite the colonial dress and the lack of eccentric attire, this woman was undoubtedly... </p><p>“Lilia?”</p><p>“You two know each other?” Agatha asked in surprise.</p><p>Lilia cocked her head, her brow curled in a light frown. “I’ve never seen that woman before in my life.”</p><p>“You saw me a few hours ago,” Rio insisted, holding up her hand. “You read my palm, remember?”</p><p>Lilia looked at Rio’s raised hand. “I haven’t done a reading in months. Not since all that hysteria in the villages.”</p><p>Rio lowered her hand, shoulders slumped in defeat. What had happened to her?</p><p>“We need to get Rio inside,” Agatha insisted, pushing past Lilia into the house. “I made sure we weren’t followed.”</p><p>Lilia stepped back, and Rio cautiously stepped inside. Compared to modern Lilia’s grand town house, the cabin-like cottage was quaint, with dried plants hung up on the walls, worn armchairs situated buy the fading fire, and the smell of spiced herbs loitering in the air.</p><p>Agatha walked to the fire, eyeing it with disdain, before flicking her hand at it. Purple light shot from her fingertips, igniting the fireplace with purple flames.</p><p>Rio jumped back. “WHAT THE FUCK!”</p><p>“Why are you shouting?” Agatha snapped. “Your magic is way more dramatic than mine.”</p><p>“My magic? I don’t have magic.”</p><p>“Yes, you do. I can feel it.”</p><p>“You can what?”</p><p>“Leave her alone, Agatha,” Lilia said from the rustic kitchen area. She came back over, balancing three cups on a tin tray. “Sit, my dear.”</p><p>Rio perched on one of the armchairs, and Lilia handed her a cup.</p><p>“Red wine,” the older woman explained. “You look like you need it.”</p><p>Rio took a large gulp, wincing at the taste. She watched Agatha snatch up one of the other cups, taking a strong sip.</p><p>“Is this the bottle I stole from judge’s pantry?”</p><p>“It is,” Lilia confirmed as she sat with her own cup in the armchair opposite Rio. “I thought it appropriate, seeing as we have a new-found witch in our company.”</p><p>“A witch?” Rio touched the ‘big witch energy’ pin on her jacket. “No, I just bought it at a gift store.”</p><p>Agatha moved over and grabbed at her collar. “You need to take that off.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Now.”</p><p>Rio sighed and unpinned it from her jacket, placing it into Agatha’s waiting hand. She watched her study it for a moment, before throwing it into the fire.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>“I’m doing you a favour,” Agatha replied, standing over the purple flames once more. “It would have gotten you killed.”</p><p>Rio looked at Lilia, who gave her a grave smile. </p><p>“Even I can sense that your magic is fresh. I’m guessing you discovered it quite recently.”</p><p>“I didn’t discover anything,” Rio insisted. “I’m not a witch.” She heard Agatha scoff and shot her a deep glare. “What’s so funny?”</p><p>“You.”</p><p>“Enough.” Lilia pointed a finger at Agatha, who sneered back, before dragging over a chair from the small dining table, placing it by the fire. </p><p>Rio gulped more wine. She just wanted to go home. </p><p>“Tell me exactly what happened,” Lilia prompted. “Everything.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, but Lilia held up a hand to stop her.</p><p>“Not you.” She pointed to Rio. “You go first.”</p><p>“I don’t know what happened. Not really. I was visiting Salem with my friend, and we were doing all the tourist traps, you know like the museums and stuff. We went to the Burying Point, and Alice, my friend, was telling me about the Lightning Tree. Some guy got hit by lightning and was buried underneath it, and now the tree keeps getting struck by lightning. I was admiring the tree when I put my hand on it and got some kind of shock. Like static electricity.”</p><p>“Electricity?” Lilia frowned. “What’s that?”</p><p>“I can’t understand half of what she’s saying,” Agatha said dismissively. Rio shot her another glower before continuing.</p><p>“It’s like lightning, kind of. We use it to create light, and to power things like a stove or, I don’t know, play music.” They both started at her in confusion, and Rio sighed in defeat. “Anyway, I kept getting this tingling in my hand, and when I went to sleep, I dreamed of running to the Lightning Tree to get away from someone, and when I touched it, I started falling. I woke up and for some reason I had to go to it, so I headed down there and put my hand on the tree again. This time, there was a large crack and a bright flash, then something shot through me, and I was falling, like in my dream. The next thing I knew, I was here, wherever this is, with Miss Strange and Mysterious loitering over me.”</p><p>Lilia nodded in acknowledgement, before looking to Agatha with a raised eyebrow. “And why were you hanging around there at this time?”</p><p>Agatha reached into her cloak and pulled out a small pouch. She tossed it to Lilia who looked inside with a disgusted expression.</p><p>“Why do you need fingertip bones?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I want to try making good luck charms.”</p><p>“Did you steal those from a grave?” Rio asked to which Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“They’d been dead almost forty years. It’s fair game to me.”</p><p>Rio didn’t know if she was disturbed or impressed.</p><p>“Anyway, I was about to head home when I saw a lightning strike. It hit the ground, and in the glow, I saw a figure. I went to see, and that’s when I found Rio.”</p><p>Lilia leaned back in the armchair, swirling the liquid in her cup. “Interesting.”</p><p>“I can assure you, I’m not a witch,” Rio said once more. “Or at least I didn’t think I was?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about that right now,” Lilia insisted. “Maybe you always have been, maybe you suddenly are, maybe you were a vessel for magic to pass through.” She held out her hand. “Can I see your palm?”</p><p>With a strong sense of deja-vu, Rio gave Lilia her hand. She watched her study the palm once more, yet also with fresh eyes.</p><p>She wondered if this Lilia was the ancestor modern Lilia had spoken about, the one with whom she shared a name. If that was true, it seemed they also shared a face. Uncannily so. To the point Rio began to question every biology class she ever had back in school.</p><p>Her gaze moved from the older woman to Agatha, who was watching the reading with great interest. There was something familiar about her face and Rio for the life of her couldn’t put her finger on it.</p><p>Lilia suddenly dropped her hand. “Agatha, can I speak to you for a moment?”</p><p>Rio watched both women all but bolt out of the front door, leaving her alone in the drafty cottage. Her eyes drifted to the fire, its glow illuminating the room in a deep purple. She didn’t know how she hadn’t totally crashed out yet. Perhaps it was adrenaline, or her mind simply being unable to comprehend any of what was happening to her. Then there was the part of her that hoped she’d wake up any minute back in the B&amp;B, with Alice banging on her door wanting to tell her everything about her evening with Jen.</p><p>Rio would give anything for that to happen.</p><p>When they shuffled back in, Rio could sense a cautiousness in the air, and as their eyes landed on her, her stomach dropped. She had a bad feeling about this.</p><p>“We’ve decided we’ll help you,” Lilia supplied. “We will try to get you home, and help you settle here in the meantime.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“Yet we have a condition,” Lilia added.</p><p>There it was. “What do you want?”</p><p>Lilia and Agatha exchanged glances.</p><p>“Well you see,” Lilia began, “Agatha and I, we, well, we just…”</p><p>“We want some of your power,” Agatha answered bluntly. “Or whatever force brought you here.”</p><p>Rio eyed them suspiciously. “What will you do with it?”</p><p>“Do you care?” Agatha questioned. “You’ll be back home by then, all those years in the future. You seem clean and healthy. It can’t be that bad there.”</p><p>“Depends how you look at it,” Rio grumbled. Her present was far from perfect, but it was where she belonged.</p><p>“So what do you say?” Lilia prompted. “Do we have a deal?”</p><p>Rio thought over her options, before quickly realizing she didn’t have any. The only hope she had was accepting the help of two women who had far less than pure intentions. Still, she nodded. “We do.”</p><p>“Excellent.” Lilia clasped her hands together. “Now we need to work out a story for your arrival in town. Perhaps she could be my niece? We could say she has come to live here with me in the New World.”</p><p>Agatha looked Rio up and down. “That isn’t going to work.”</p><p>“Why not?” Rio questioned.</p><p>“Look at you. You’re not a lady. You walk like a man, talk like a man, you even sit like one.”</p><p>Rio looked down and saw she was manspreading. She quickly tried to cross her legs, but she could tell by Agatha’s judgmental stare that she wasn’t successful.</p><p>“Well she can’t stay here all the time,” Lilia argued. “The only other thing we could do is…Rio, can you stand for a moment?”</p><p>Rio got to her feet, standing stiff as Lilia looked over her.</p><p>“Arms out,” she said, and Rio followed the instruction. “Thank you. Agatha, why don’t you take Rio for a walk to the river? It does look awfully beautiful at sunrise.”</p><p>Agatha looked like she wanted to argue, but instead she beckoned for Rio to follow her. “If you’re lucky, I’ll pick you a plum for breakfast.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha did pick her a plum, but only because the first one she picked had a slight bruise on it. Rio was too famished to care.</p><p>The Salem River was prettier than she expected, undisturbed by modern life, with trees lining the banks, and birds waking as the sun rose up, setting the sky on fire. The water reflected the vibrant orange, rippling calmly with the light morning breeze.</p><p>They stood on the riverbank, Agatha leaning against the tree while Rio stood awkwardly, unsure where to put herself.</p><p>She saw Agatha look her up and down. “How old are you?”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Agatha turned her head away from her. “Excuse me for trying to make conversation.”</p><p>Rio slumped her shoulders. “Sorry.  I’m twenty-seven.”</p><p>Agatha looked back at her in surprise. “I thought you were my age.”</p><p>“How olds that?” Rio asked as she took another bite from the fruit.</p><p>“Twenty-one,” Agatha answered. “Are you married?”</p><p>Rio almost spat out her plum. “God no.”</p><p>“So you’re a spinster?”</p><p>“No, I’m someone who owns a successful business and doesn’t need anyone else to fulfil my self-worth.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I may have to use that on my mother when she berates me about getting a husband. I wouldn’t mind, but she had me out of wedlock. She says that’s why I’m so wicked.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “A wicked witch.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her like she was an idiot, but didn’t comment.</p><p>“Are you scared?” she asked instead.</p><p>“Scared?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “About being here.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Here with you? I don’t know, are you going to use your purple on me?”</p><p>“My purple? You mean the magic I have spent most of my life mastering?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah, your purple.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Never mind. You’re ridiculous.”</p><p>She watched Agatha kick off her shoes and step up to the river edge, the water reaching the bottom of her skirt. Throwing the remnants of her plum in the foliage, Rio pulled off her own shoes and moved to stand beside her.</p><p>Rio picked up a stone and skimmed it across the water.  She saw Agatha look with interest. Picking up another, she skimmed the water again, getting even further.</p><p>“Impressive,” Agatha commented, before picking up on of her own. She threw it across, and it went twice as far.</p><p>“Did you use magic?”</p><p>Agatha gasped in mock offense. “I would never!”</p><p>Rio shook her head and threw another stone. They stayed like that for a while, as the sun rose up above the trees, trying to best each other. It seemed Agatha was quite competitive, and she was sure magic did come into play towards the end.</p><p>“Cheater,” she accused when Agatha’s stone almost made it to the other side of the river.</p><p>“Of course. It’s the best way to win.”</p><p> Rio laughed, but it soon died in her throat, she stared out at the water before sucking in a sharp breath.</p><p>“I’m terrified.”</p><p>Agatha looked back at her. “You are?”</p><p>“How could I not be?” Rio questioned, to which Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“You seem so calm about it.”</p><p>“My emotions aren’t always the same as other peoples,” Rio explained. “Or I don’t always express them the same way. I don’t always cry when I should. It just seems to stay bottled up.”</p><p>“Me too,” Agatha admitted, before clearing her throat. “But I’m glad you’re not crying. That would have gotten very annoying.”</p><p>Rio laughed again and skimmed another stone.</p><p>They headed back to Lilia’s after a while, and by then, morning was in full swing. When they returned, Lilia gave them both porridge and Rio shovelled it down, even if it definitely didn’t taste like the porridge she was used to. It seemed time travel certainly worked up an appetite.</p><p>“So what’s this grand plan?” Agatha asked. “How are we going to make our little voyager her fit into Salem life?”</p><p>“By making her exactly that.” Lilia got up from the table. “You made a good point. Rio’s hair is too short to be styled properly and holds herself in a very…unladylike manner. She can’t be a settler, or someone with a link to myself. No, she has to be exactly what she is: a distant traveller.”</p><p>“You’re making less sense than usual, you batty old hag,” Agatha snapped. “Get to the point.”</p><p>Lilia left the room for a moment, before returning with a hand behind her back. “There’s only one character she can play. One that will explain away any gaps or any sudden disappearance.”</p><p>With that, she pulled the item from behind her back, revealing a black naval hat. Rio stared at it, confused.</p><p>“You want me to be a sailor?”</p><p>“No, no. You, dear Rio…” Lilia placed the hat on her head “…will be a captain.”</p><p>“Won’t that bring up more questions?” Rio asked. “Won’t people be expecting me to come with a crew, and a ship?”</p><p>“That’s the beauty of this plan. You’ll be a captain that’s fallen on tragedy, who needs to settle on land for a while, but you still have a sense of adventure and discovery, so you come to the New World to find both.”</p><p>“Your imagination is getting the better of you,” Agatha accused. “No one will believe a woman is a captain.”</p><p>“Because she won’t be a woman, not to everyone else. She’ll be Captain Rio, an adventurous bachelor.”</p><p>Rio touched the hat in her head. It didn’t bother her presenting as a man. She had always had a loose view on her gender, and she figured being a man in the 17th century was a lotsafer than being a woman. It was the lie that bothered her. A lie she would have to keep up for every moment, or face potentially dangerous consequences.</p><p>“What kind of magic are you going to use to make her look the part?” Agatha asked. “She looks about twelve.”</p><p>“You shall see, but for now you need to eat up and head back home.”</p><p>“But…” Agatha went to argue, yet Lilia was swift to cut her off.</p><p>“Your mother will likely be furious already, and we don’t need her storming over here. Not right now. We’ll see you later.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and pushed back her chair. “Fine, but if she looks ridiculous, you only have yourself to blame.”</p><p>Rio watched her storm out of the cabin, their eyes catching briefly as she disappeared out of the door. She leaned across the table and started finishing off the porridge Agatha had left behind. Shameless, she knew, but she was too hungry to care.</p><p>Lilia clapped her hands encouragingly. “Eat up, my dear. We have a lot of work to do. All being well, and you’ll be having your Salem debut this afternoon.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes as she ate. This was the worst day of her life.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia had to cut her hair. Not a lot, but enough to make Rio curse that stupid fucking town and that stupid fucking tree and Agatha fucking Harkness for finding her and dragging her into whatever dumb fucking scheme she and Lilia were planning.</p><p>The clothes were also itchy, but luckily not as uncomfortable as she imagined a corseted dress would be. The heavy coat and high collar would take a lot to get used to, yet as she stood before the warped glass of Lilia’s mirror, her hair pushed back and tied in a short ponytail, she had to admit she didn’t look half bad. The pistol on her hip, however, was a bit much.</p><p>“Is this necessary?” she asked, gesturing to the weapon.</p><p>“Yes, but if you’re aim isn’t good, I’d leave it for show.”</p><p>“My aim is fine,” Rio insisted. “Where did you get all this stuff, anyway?”</p><p>“Here and there,” Lilia said vaguely. “I keep things in case they come in handy, and here we are. I had a few other suitable outfits, and I’ve put them in the other bedroom. That’ll be yours while you’re here.”</p><p>Despite wishing to be back home with every fibre of her being, knowing she had a room of her own was somewhat of a relief.</p><p>Lilia placed the hat on her head. “What do you think, Captain Vidal?”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened. She knew there would one day be a real Captain Vidal in Salem, one with a wife and a grand house. A man that wasn’t her.</p><p>“I do think we need to change my name,” she insisted for the third time, but Lilia shook her head once more.</p><p>“Names are the one lie that gets tricky. We stick as close to the truth as we can. That way we can’t go wrong.”</p><p>There were many ways this could go wrong, and many more ways it already had. Yet, despite the sickening feeling in her chest, Rio focused on her reflection. This was her armour. This was how she would survive, at least long enough to get home.</p><p>The walk to Salem was geographically a short one, yet as she walked through the streets with Lilia on her arm, it seemed to go on forever.</p><p>People stopped to look at them as they approached, men sizing Rio up while woman…well, they seemed to be doing the same, yet with far different intentions.  </p><p>As they walked by a gathering of young woman, Rio noticed their whispering and, with a shot of ego, decided to indulge them. Offering them a charming smile, she tipped her hat to them, smirking when they all burst into excitable giggles.</p><p>“Perhaps I underestimated that smile of yours,” Lilia said with a chuckle. “At this rate, you’re going to be the most eligible bachelor in town.”</p><p>Rio laughed with her. Maybe the situation wasn’t going to be <em>entirely</em> unbearable.</p><p>As they continued down the street, Rio spotted another woman. A familiar one, in a fresh purple dress but with the same wild hair. She met them halfway, her gaze oozing with an overconfidence vastly contrasted the shy glances of the other women in town.</p><p>“Well, well, well.” Agatha’s eyes trailed over her with a smirk. “You clean up nicely, sailor.”</p><p>Rio tipped her hat to her. “Thank you, my lady.”</p><p>“And a gentleman?” Agatha looked to Lilia. “A good attempt, but it’s a shame you cut her hair.”</p><p>“His,” Rio corrected her, hoping she wasn’t going to have the pronoun debate with a 17<sup>th</sup> century witch. Luckily, Agatha just waved her off.</p><p>“Well, you certainly are attracting attention. What’s you cover?”</p><p>“I’m staying with Lilia. Renting her room.”</p><p>“I gave Rio some of those shillings you gave me for safe keeping,” Lilia told her. “And before you argue, Rio has agreed to help pay it back.”</p><p>Agatha’s face turned sour, her hands landing on her hips. “And how are you planning to do that?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I’ll find a way.”</p><p>“Oh, you better.” Agatha stepped up to her, jabbing a finger in her face. “Or you’ll certainly live to regret it.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, a sharp voice cut through the air.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, get back here right now!”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders slumped. “I will revisit this later.”</p><p>Rio watched her walk back towards an angry looking woman stood by a well, two buckets at her feet. Agathe picked up both buckets and followed the woman back down the street.</p><p>Rio went to go help, but Lilia placed a hand on her chest to stop her.</p><p>“Just stay out of that,” she advised. “Now, come on, the best place for you to integrate will be a local tavern.”</p><p>Rio allowed Lilia to lead her back in the other direction, stealing a glance back at Agatha as she went. She must have sensed someone watching her, as Agatha soon did the same. Their eyes met once more, their walks faltering for a moment.</p><p>“Agatha!” the shrill voice snapped again. “Come on!”</p><p>Agatha looked away and carried on down the street, and a tug on her arm made Rio focus forward again. She gave Lilia an apologetic look, before slipping into her new role once more.</p><p>Captain Rio Vidal, the wayward explorer.</p><p>How she wished this was all just a bad dream.</p>

<p>The Tavern was somehow better and worse than Rio imagined. Worse, because the smell of Ale and sweat was near unbearable, and better because the only taverns she had seen were in stuff like Game of Thrones and it was all murder, sex, or both. This was just a load of men sat drinking and grumbling.</p><p>“Well,” Lilia patted her on the back, “go buy yourself a drink and I’ll come get you after I’ve run some errands.”</p><p>“What? You’re leaving me?”</p><p>“Go socialise,” she encouraged. “A captain wouldn’t want to be hanging around his landlady all day. You may even make some acquaintances.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, Lilia walked out of the door, leaving her to fend for herself.</p><p>Some people looked her way, intrigued and cautious of the new stranger in town, but Rio kept her head high. She slid onto a stool and took her hat off, placing it on the bar. “Good day, sir.”</p><p>The barman nodded his head to her. “Ale?”</p><p>“Please.”</p><p>“Halfpenny.”</p><p>Lilia had given her a crash course on the currency, so she confidently handed over the small copper coin. The barman slammed a tankard in front of her before walking away.</p><p>“Captain, huh?”</p><p>Rio looked to see a man with a ratty beard and a missing front tooth standing beside her. While his clothes weren’t as dapper as hers, he was no peasant. He was relatively clean, or at least his clothes were, and looked well fed enough.</p><p>Rio raised an eyebrow. “How do you know I’m not some common sailor?”</p><p>“I’ve seen enough of them down at the dock to know what that hat means. You were here with Lilia, I saw. How did you get friendly with her?”</p><p>Rio took a sip of her Ale and tried not to grimace. It tasted foul. “You have a lot of questions.”</p><p>The man chuckled and held out his hand. “Ralph Bohner.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip as not to laugh. Oh, what an unfortunate name. She took the man’s hand in a firm shake. “Captain Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“What boat did you come in on? Usually, we don’t see you guys this far from the docks.”</p><p>“I didn’t come from the docks,” Rio explained. “I came by carriage from Boston.”</p><p>“You did, huh?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I originally went to enquire about studying at Harvard University. After all, I have a lot of great knowledge of the world that shouldn’t go to waste, but alas my sense for adventure could not be quenched. A friend of mine recommended Salem as a place for me to base myself, and by a stroke luck I bumped into Ms Calderu on my way into town.”</p><p>“So, you’re staying with her in that cabin?” he asked. “Just you two.”</p><p>“Yes…”</p><p>Ralph patted Rio on the back. “I hear older women are a real good time. They just aren’t as perky.”</p><p>Oh, Rio wanted to slap that little fucker, but she couldn’t. She had to be a man and so, she laughed along with him. “As radiant as she is, Ms Calderu is treating me like the son she never had. With a fine bed, and delicious porridge to set me up for the day. My own mother died many years ago, and so such comforts are a novelty to me.”</p><p>There. That sounded good enough to her.</p><p>“You speak well,” Ralph commented. “Where abouts are you from?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “The seven seas, my friend. My father was a captain, my mother the woman he fell in love with at a faraway port. I’ve never spent more than a few nights on dry land until now.”</p><p>“You must have a lot of stories, huh?”</p><p>“Oh, many.”</p><p>“Go on then,” Ralph encouraged. “Tell me one.”</p><p>Before she could begin to lie her way through a story of pirates and sea monsters, a commotion broke out at the far end of the tavern.</p><p>“Take your silly scribblings out of here, Shade,” a gruff voice demanded. “We’re sick of your rambling.”</p><p>“I just want you to listen,” a well-spoken voice replied. “It could really revolutionise…”</p><p>“No one cares,” another voice cut him off. “Get out of here.”</p><p>“What’s going on?” Rio asked Ralph, who snickered.</p><p>“He’s like you. A Harvard man. Came here with all these ideas no one wants to hear. Doesn’t get the hint though.”</p><p>Rio watched as two men dragged the man out. He was well-dressed, tall and slender, with strawberry blonde hair brushing the top of his shoulders. They opened the door and threw him out on the street, while another ran up and chucked a load of papers out after him.</p><p>“And don’t come back with those again,” one of them shouted after him, before they all laughed and returned to their respective tables.</p><p>Rio downed the rest of her tankard and bowed her head to Ralph. “Pleasure to meet you,” she lied. “I hope to see you again, sometime.”</p><p>“Come by tomorrow,” he told her. “We’re having a game of cards at midday. Make sure you bring your money.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I’ll see you then.”</p><p>With that, she made her way outside. There, the ejected man was crawling on the ground trying to collect his papers. Taking pity on him, she crouched down to help.</p><p>“You have a lot of paper,” she commented. “Must have taken you hours to write all this.”</p><p>“It did,” the man confirmed. “Yet no one seems to care.”</p><p>“I might.” Rio helped him up and handed over the papers she had collected. “What’s it about?”</p><p>“I don’t wish to speak of it now,” the man admitted. “I must head back. I have other matters to attend to, but thank you, Captain…”</p><p>“Vidal,” she held out her hand. “Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Victor Shade.” The man shook her hand swiftly. “Now, I really must go.”</p><p>Rio watched him leave, just in time to see Lilia storming down the street.</p><p>“Are you alright?” Rio asked, but Lilia simply linked their arms.</p><p>“Evanora Harkness is a rotten old witch,” she huffed. “I wish to head home.”</p><p>Rio wanted to ask what was wrong, but the woman’s face was set like stone, and she knew better than to prod at something so hardened.</p><p>Back at the cabin, Lilia started to fuss about cleaning and making bread. Rio went to sleep in her room. It was simple- a small cot with a straw mattress, a small wardrobe where Lilia had put for her some more variations for captain attire, a small wooden chair, and a piece of dried lavender nailed to the wall above her bed.</p><p>The bed itself was uncomfortable, but she was too exhausted to care. Shrugging off her captain attire and folded them on the chair, her hat perched safely on top, she snuggled up under the rough blanket. She dozed off quickly, her mind taking her back to her own time. To drive-thru burgers and smartphones and electricity. To Alice and to her flower shop, when their worries were about the future, never the past.</p><p>She woke up abruptly, her hand flying upwards to grasp the edge of the bed as it shook. Rio looked up to see Agatha stood over her, hands on her hips.</p><p>“Asleep during the day? Are you ill?”</p><p>“I’m tired,” Rio snapped, sitting up. She noticed Agatha’s eyes had gone wide. “What?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and looked at the ceiling. “I don’t appreciate being constantly accosted by your nudity, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio looked down to see the undershirt Lilia had lent her and saw the top buttons were undone, showing Agatha a good amount of cleavage. She quickly buttoned it up. “Sorry.”</p><p>Agatha finally looked back to her, and Rio could see a redness in her cheeks. “Lilia has made us a stew. Please dress appropriately and come on threw.”</p><p>Once Agatha left, Rio changed into a shirt and trousers before making her way out to the living area.  Lilia and Agatha stood by the fireplace, the former stirring a large pot placed over it, while the latter observed critically.</p><p>“You haven’t put enough herbs in it,” Agatha commented. “I can smell it.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Lilia insisted. “I put in the same as always.”</p><p>“Smells good to me,” Rio said as she approached. “Anything I can do to help?”</p><p>“Get the bowls out, dear.”</p><p>Rio looked around and found three bowls and spoons for them. They served up the strew before retiring to the table. Lilia cut up the bread she had made that afternoon, and they all tucked in. The stew was bland, but not bad. The meat was definitely fresher than what she usually had, but she wasn’t quite sure what it was.</p><p>Rio decided she didn’t want to know.</p><p>“How was your time at the tavern?” Lilia asked. “Did you speak to anyone?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Someone called Ralph.”</p><p>Agatha made a sound of pure disgust. “I hate that man.”</p><p>That didn’t surprise Rio. Agatha seemed like the type of person who disliked most people for the fact they were breathing.</p><p>“He’s proposed to her three times,” Lilia explained. “In the space of two months.”</p><p>“What?” Rio’s eyes widened. “Did he get the message the first two times?”</p><p>“He never gets the message,” Agatha grumbled. “I don’t want to marry.”</p><p>“You won’t have to if you don’t want to,” Lilia assured. “As for Rio here, she’s had all the ladies swooning. I had a number of people come to me asking about you, and a few were mothers asking for their daughters.”</p><p>“Oh God, you didn’t…”</p><p>“I told them you weren’t looking for a wife, but it’s not very often I’m so sought after. I must admit, I was enjoying the attention.”</p><p>“You were,” Agatha confirmed. “Until my mother called you a whore.”</p><p>Rio chocked on her bread.</p><p>“She is the only person who can see my taking in a young gentleman in need as something sinful,” Lilia huffed. “Like she has any room to talk about purity.”</p><p>“She’s a grumpy old bitch,” Agatha said spitefully. “Imagine living with her.”</p><p>Rio finished off her stew and leaned back in her chair. “That was lovely. Thanks, Lilia.”</p><p>“You’re welcome, dear. So what are your plans for tomorrow? Shall we begin perusing my hidden tomes to see if we can find a way to get you home?”</p><p>“Yes, certainly! But I have to be at the Tavern for midday. I’ve been invited to play cards.”</p><p>“Cards?” Agatha’s face was filled with outrage. “I hope you don’t mean to gamble away <em>my </em>money.”</p><p>“I won’t gamble it away,” Rio told her. “I’ll double it.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Said by every man who’s lost their fortunes at a cards table.”</p><p>“Well, I’m no man,” Rio reminded her. “And I know what I’m doing.”</p><p>“Fine, then I will accompany you. I need to make sure you know when to stop.”</p><p>“Coming to a tavern with me?” Rio teased. “My, my, Miss Harkness. People will talk.”</p><p>“Let them,” Agatha said dismissively. “I want my money.”</p><p>“And you’ll get it,” Rio promised. “Just wait.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was pacing outside the tavern when Rio arrived.</p><p>“You’re going to wear a hole in the ground,” she warned, earning a scowl.</p><p>“Excuse me for being nervous that you’re going to lose all the money I’ve worked to save. Do you know how hard it is to pick pockets these days?”</p><p>Rio had suspected the money was stolen, as she suspected the clothes she was currently wearing were also, so the confirmation didn’t bother her. After all, she was playing along with the con. The two witches wanted power, both physical and monetary, and she was about to prove she was necessary for both.</p><p>“It’ll be fine,” Rio assured, before pulling the tavern door open. “After you, my lady.”</p><p>Agatha shot her another glare before she stomped inside, Rio following after.</p><p>The Tavern was busy, a table set out in the middle of the room while people stood along the walls, tankards in hands as chatter and deep laughter echoed through the space.</p><p>“Agatha!” Ralph appeared out of the crowd. “What a surprise!”</p><p>Agatha gave him a look of disgust, before turning to Rio. “Let’s find somewhere to sit.”</p><p>Ralph looked to Rio, the friendliness from the day before instantly evaporating. “You two know each other?”</p><p>“Lilia sent Agatha with me,” Rio lied. “She’s worried I’ll gamble away my rent.”</p><p>Ralph gave her a tight-lipped smile, before stepping up to whisper to in her ear. “Wouldn’t bother with that one, mate. I’ve heard…unsavoury things. Sinful things.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows, before whispering back. “Well, it can’t have bothered you much. Seeing as you proposed to her three times.”</p><p>Ralph walked back to his friends, grumbling under his breath as he went.</p><p>“What was that about?” Agatha asked, and Rio shrugged.</p><p>“No idea.”</p><p>Rio found them two chairs and took of her hat as she sat. She was starting to get used to it but was relieved to be finally able to take it off. They watched as the players sat at the table, and a dealer dealt their hands.</p><p>“What game are they playing?” Rio asked Agatha.</p><p>“Veinte y uno,” Agatha answered. “Some Spanish sailor taught them it a few months ago and now they can’t stop.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Wait, Twenty-One?”</p><p>“You know it?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I might.”</p><p>The first game included Ralph and three other men. They gambled their hands, handfuls coins, nothing more. The game didn’t last long, and Ralph took the money with a greedy grin on his face. Rio heard Agatha tut beside her.</p><p>Ralph remained at the table, pushing his winnings to bet, and two other players stepped up. One thew a purse of money into the middle, while the other held a leather-bound book up in the air.</p><p>“Victor Shade’s Ledger,” he announced, causing laughter to ring through the room. “Whoever wins gets the pleasure of burning it.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. She hated fucking bullies.</p><p>“We need one more,” the dealer announced.</p><p>“Unless you’re all too chicken,” Ralph called out. “Lady luck is on my side today.”</p><p>Rio held her hat out to Agatha. “Look after this for me.”</p><p>Agatha took it with a frown. “What are you…”</p><p>Before she could finish, Rio was on her feet. “I’ll play”</p><p>She walked across the room and slid in the seat opposite Ralph. She threw the money purse on the table. Everything she had. Everything Agatha had.</p><p>Ralph smirked, before reaching into his pocket and throwing even more money on the table. “Very well, Captain.”</p><p>He was confident, overly confident. Rio would take great satisfaction in taking every last dime he had.</p><p>The game began and Rio watched the cards closely. She succeeded the first round, knocking the ledger thief out, who grumbled back to the bar. The next round, the other man ended up over twenty-one, leaving two men standing.</p><p>Her and Ralph.</p><p>“Well, well, Captain. I’m sorry to show you up in front of your new belle.”</p><p>“She’s not my belle,” Rio answered. “Just shut up and play the game.”</p><p>The dealer dealt their cards, and Rio looked at her two. The 5 of hearts and the 5 of diamonds.</p><p>She peeked over her set to Ralph, who had an annoying smirk on his face.</p><p>Rio hit the table.</p><p>“Oh, is you hand not good enough?” he teased, as the dealer slid her another card.</p><p>Rio added it to her stack, keeping up her best poker face. “Why? Feeling a little nervous over there, Bohner?”</p><p>He chuckled. “I’m never nervous, Captain. In fact, I’m going to buy your girl a drink with my winnings.”</p><p>Rio stole a glance back at Agatha, who was clutching her hat in her lap, biting her lip nervously. She gave her a reassuring smile, before facing Ralph again.</p><p>“Show me your hand, then?”</p><p>Ralph smirked and lay his two cards on the table. Two Jacks.</p><p>“A perfect twenty,” he declared. “Should I just take my winnings now?”</p><p>Rio sighed, making a show defeat. “Well, I don’t have a perfect twenty, but I do have…”</p><p>She placed her cards down. Two fives and an ace.</p><p>The smile slipped from Ralph’s face as applause spread through the room.</p><p>“A perfect twenty-one!” the dealer declared. “Congratulations, Captain Vidal.”</p><p>Rio grinned and collected her winnings. She bowed her head to Ralph. “Better luck next time.”</p><p>Walking back to Agatha, she added some more coins to her money purse and handing it over.</p><p>“Told you I’d make it up to you.”</p><p>Agatha grinned and placed the hat back on Rio’s head. “Let’s go tell Lilia the good news.”</p><p>Rio pocketed the rest of her winnings and tucked Mr Shade’s ledger under her arm. “Lead the way, my lady.”</p><p>Once they were out on the street, Agatha pounced. “How did you do that? Was it luck or…”</p><p>“A little, but not totally,” Rio admitted. “I can count cards.”</p><p>“So you cheated?”</p><p>“Yep. An old trick I learned when I was younger. It helped when I needed some extra money. The trick is to not always win. That’s why I only scarped by on the first two rounds. Can’t be too obvious.”</p><p>Agatha linked arms with her. “We are definitely taking advantage of this.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “I expected so.”</p><p> </p><p>Lilia had been quite impressed by her achievements and had gotten out a fresh bottle of wine to celebrate. Agatha had gone home- word had gotten out that she had been frequenting the tavern and her mother was furious.</p><p>The more Rio heard of Agatha’s mother, the more she wished not to meet her.</p><p>Rio sat by the fire, flipping through Victor Shade’s ledger. Most of it was money, projected revenues for everything from blacksmiths to bakeries. It all seemed innocent to her, though she figured there had to be some reason why the town had turned against the poor man.</p><p>Not that it was any of her business.</p><p>Lilia returned from her bedroom with a battered looking book. She sat in the armchair opposite her and opened it in her lap. “I recall there being something here about magic and lightning. I know it’s a rare kind of magic, more akin to a god than a witch.”</p><p>“And I’m neither,” Rio argued. “I’d take the third option which is an atmospheric phenomenon.”</p><p>Lilia ignored her, searching through the book until she paused at a page. “Here it is. It says that ‘<em>Lightning is not inherently a magical event, however a powerful witch can have the potential to harness it and use it as a conductor to trigger a larger pulse of magic. However, this has only once been recorded in the days of Ancient Greece, with accounts that the goddess Hecate summonsed lightning to her palms in order to complete a great incantation. Those who have tried this in the centuries since have failed and often perished’.”</em></p><p>“What does that mean for me?”</p><p>“It means you’ve got yourself mixed up in a very powerful magical event.”</p><p>“I gathered time travel would need a lot of juice. I just don’t understand why me? And why 1693?”</p><p>“I don’t have those answers, my dear, but we’ll keep trying.”</p><p>Rio nodded and looked down at the ledger in her lap. “I would like to return this to Mr Shade but I have no idea where I could find him.”</p><p>“He works at a bookkeepers in town,” Lilia informed. “For Mr Davis.”</p><p>“I’ll return it to him tomorrow.”</p><p>“But you’re keeping the rest of the money, right?”</p><p>“Most definitely.”</p><p>“Good, because Agatha would never let you live that down.”</p><p>Rio looked into the flames of the fire with a frown. “Lilia?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Why doesn’t Agatha want to marry? I understand why she doesn’t want to marry Ralph, but the way she talks about her mother, wouldn’t marriage be her escape?”</p><p>“She’d be walking from one torment to another,” Lilia explained. “It’s not my place to say more.”</p><p>Rio turned her attention back to the fire, the orange glow harsher than Agatha’s purple flames.</p><p>The woman’s face flashed in front of her eyes. The way she bit her lip when she was nervous, the way she smiled at their victory, the way she blushed when she saw the slightest glimpse of Rio chest.</p><p>She quickly shook the thoughts away. No, she had greater things to focus on: surviving and finding a way home.</p>

<p>Victor Shade worked in a small shopfront close to the marketplace. Lilia elected to walk ahead, telling her she wished to get to the town’s weekly market before the good produce had been sold. So Rio pushed open the creaky door, and entered the shop alone.</p><p>Mr Shade stood behind the counter. He looked as he did the first time she saw him, except for a purple bruise visible under his left eye. She was putting the pieces together now.</p><p>“Captain.” He moved round the counter to approach her, his movements stiff. “To what do I owe the pleasure?”</p><p>Rio held the ledger out to him. “Took a good game of cards, but I managed to save this from the fire.”</p><p>“Our ledger!” He grinned from ear to ear as he took it. “Oh, I thought it would be long destroyed by now. How can I ever repay you?”</p><p>“Don’t worry about it,” Rio assured. “I hope you don’t mind, but I did look through it. I noticed some mistakes, so made the amendments.”</p><p>“Mistakes?” Mr Shade flipped through the book. He stopped at a page and frowned. “Well, I’ll be. You’ve got quite the eye, Captain Vidal.”</p><p>“Rio, please,” she insisted. “And I used to do my own books for…erm ships. My ships! You know, cargo, payments, supplies.”</p><p>“Perhaps you should come do some accounting for us,” Mr Shade suggested. “We could do with someone else able to work with numbers.”</p><p>“Perhaps, but for now I must go. I’m meeting my landlady at the market.”</p><p>“Very well,” Mr Shade replied. “Good day, and thank you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio tipped her hat before taking her leave. That was one good deed done, and she hoped that good karmic points would work in her favour. She needed all the help she could get while in this impossible dilemma.</p><p>She easily found the marketplace. It was bustling with townsfolk, with stalls of everything from food to livestock filling the space. Lilia was stood by a garment stall, examining a piece of embroidered cloth.</p><p>“All sorted?” Lilia asked without looking up.</p><p>“Yeah. Nice guy.” Rio looked at the fabric. “You want that?”</p><p>Lilia shrugged then put it back. “I don’t need it.”</p><p>“But do you want it?”</p><p>“Yes, but…”</p><p>“Excuse me,” Rio called to the owner of the stall. “How much for this?”</p><p>“Rio,” Lilia protested, but the money was exchanged, and Rio held the folded fabric out to her.</p><p>“A thank you for helping me,” she insisted.</p><p>Lilia took the gift and put it in her basket. “You can’t throw your money away like that.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I can win more, and it’s not like I can take it with me when I go home.”</p><p>“You don’t know how long you’ll be here for,” Lilia pointed out. “You could be months. Years, even!”</p><p>Years?! Rio fucking hoped not.</p><p>“I’m going to go barter for some meat,” Lilia announced. “Why don’t you go wander round? But don’t spend all that money! If I knew a money spell, I’d live in a Sicilian castle, not a cottage in this hell pit.”</p><p>Lilia left her, once again, to her own devices. This time, Rio was a bit more at ease. She was in the open, and the crowds didn’t consist of drunken men jeering and sweltering. No, the men at the market seemed a little more together, walking with their wives, corralling animals, and chasing their children as they escaped through the crowd.</p><p>There were also women of all ages, socializing and pottering. Those were the ones Rio noticed, mostly because they didn’t hide their notice of her. From the straying eyes of women on their husband’s arm, to young bells with eager stares wishing her to take notice. It seemed they linked a man in uniform.</p><p>There was only one that caught her eye in return. A brunette stood by a fruit stall, examining an apple with a frown.</p><p>Rio smirked and walked towards her. “What’s that apple ever done to you?”<br/>
Agatha glanced at her before turning her gaze back to the offending fruit. “I’ve never had a fresh one.”</p><p>“You haven’t?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “They’re always old and rotting.”</p><p>“Aren’t there any apple trees round here?”</p><p>“They planted some saplings, but the winter killed them off. Either way it would be a while before we got apples from them.”</p><p>Rio picked up another apple. “I’ll grow you an apple tree.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “How will you do that?”</p><p>“Hey, I’m good with plants! It’s my job back home. I’m a florist.”</p><p>“A what?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I sell flowers.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Seriously?”</p><p>“Yeah. Pretty good at it too. I’ll arrange you a beautiful bouquet.”</p><p>“A bouquet?”</p><p>“It’s French,” Rio told her. “It means bunch. So like a bunch of flowers.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Why not just say that then?”</p><p>Rio chose not to bite and picked up another apple. “These two and the one the lady has,” he said to the vender and handed over the payment.</p><p>Agatha took a bite out of her apple and stared Rio down as she chewed.</p><p>“I’ll grow you a tree,” Rio repeated as she pocketed the other two apples. “Something to remind you of me when I’m gone.”</p><p>“By the time it grows, I won’t even recall your name.” Agatha looked over the bitten fruit. “I may detest apples by then.”</p><p>“I like apples,” Rio commented. “But where I’m from, they’re easy to get. Like a staple food, pretty much. Especially in a pie.”</p><p>“I love apple pie!” Agatha gushed. “I don’t have it often though.”</p><p>“Well when my tree grows you can have as much as you like!”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Maybe I won’t be in Salem by then.”</p><p>“Then I better find something better for you to remember me with,” Rio joked. “How about a pineapple? Aren’t they like super special in this time?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “You’ve had a pineapple?”</p><p>“Yeah, I had one about a week ago. Sometimes I have it on pizza, but that’s controversial in my time.”</p><p>“You know, half the time I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said defeatedly. “I feel like I’ve just dropped down from outer space.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her in confusion, but Rio didn’t attempt to explain. At that moment, a group of women walked by, giggling as they went.</p><p>“Stupid girls,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“That’s not kind.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “I swear you’ve somehow turned most of the townswomen into mush with that ridiculous hat.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “But not you?”</p><p>“No, I think you look like a fool.”</p><p>“Alright.” Rio took off her hat. “What about now?”</p><p>“Still a fool.”</p><p>“Oh, Miss Harkness you wound me!”</p><p>“Shut up.” Agatha took another aggressive bite out of her apple. “Go get one of your girls to kiss it better.”</p><p>“I don’t have girls,” Rio corrected. “And the only one I’m interested in talking to is right here in front of me.”</p><p>She watched Agatha’s reaction closely. Observed as the lightest of blushes appeared on her cheeks and studied the way she bit at her lip. Interesting. Very interesting.</p><p>Rio put her hat back on her head. “I think you secretly like it, you know.”</p><p>Agatha glared at her. “I’m going to shove that hat right up…”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness!”</p><p>They both looked to see a vexed woman walking towards them, a wicker basket in one hand and a wooden bucket in the other. She had a stern face, both in expression and structure, with long grey hair tied in a long braid down her back. Rio had to admit, she was pretty terrifying.</p><p>“Mother, I am talking,” Agatha huffed. “I’ll help you in a moment.”</p><p>The woman’s gaze then turned to Rio. “And who are you to speak to my daughter?”</p><p>Rio took off her hat again, holding it to her chest as she bowed. “Captain Rio Vidal. A pleasure to make your acquaintance, ma’am.”</p><p>“Ah, Lilia’s little lodger.” The woman’s lips curled into a smile. “I’m Evanora Harkness, and I ask that should you wish to speak to my daughter again, you do so under my guardianship. And that you seek permissions before certain questions be asked.”</p><p>“<em>Mother</em>,” Agatha said through gritted teeth. “It’s not like that. We were just talking.”</p><p>“Oh I’m sure you were, you poisonous girl. Come on, let’s go home.”</p><p>Agatha gave Rio an apologetic look, before following her mother through the crowd.</p><p>Rio watched them go. She didn’t like that. Not one bit. She thought of what Lilia said the night before. How Agatha was trapped in a limbo between her mother and the prospect of marriage. How the one thing that was certainly get her out of her mother’s grasp would throw her right into another’s.</p><p>She wished she could help, but she wasn’t sure how.</p><p>A voice brought her out of her thoughts. “Hey Captain!”</p><p>Rio looked around to see one of the venders beckoning her over.</p><p>“Can I help you?” she asked as she approached the stranger, who just smiled.</p><p>“I think I’m the one who can help you.” He opened a large case. “You like that girl? Buy her something nice.”</p><p>Inside the case was a number of pieces. Bracelets, necklaces, rings, broaches. They all looked fancy. Distinctive. All likely stolen. But nothing Rio found particularly interesting.</p><p>Until she spotted something. A cameo locket depicting three women against a purple backing. Rio reached in and picked it up.</p><p>“Maiden, mother, crone,” the man commented. “It’s a strange choice. Do you think she’d like it?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio admitted, her eyes still studying the pendent. There was something about it. Something she recognized from somewhere, but she couldn’t quite put her finger on it.</p><p>“Since I can see you are quite drawn to it, I’ll offer a good price,” the man bartered. “Eight shillings.”</p><p>Rio handed it over and pocketed the locket. “Thanks.”</p><p>“Good luck,” the man replied. “She seems like a handful.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “You have no idea.”<br/>
<br/>
Lilia pointed out an area in the garden where Rio could plant an apple seed, but was insistent there could only be one and that she was taking no responsibility in caring for it. Rio agreed and planted it the best she could with what was available, before heading back to her room.</p><p>She had turned her phone off. She didn’t want the battery to die. It was currently at 80%, with no signal and no way of recharging it once the battery eventually died. That afternoon, she allowed herself five minutes.</p><p>She looked through her photos. Of the selfies she and Alice had taken that day in Salem, so many years from now but mere days in the past for her. To pictures of them outside the flower shop, of bouquets, of her celebrity crushes, of her old life. Her true life.</p><p>She thought back over the passage Lilia had read to her the night before. Lightning. A magical power that only a mythical goddess could harness. Something she had managed without realising…if she believed what Lilia was suggesting...</p><p>“Captain,” Lilia’s voice called. “There is a gentleman here to see you.”</p><p>Rio turned off her phone and hid it under her pillow, before stepping back into her new role once more. She walked out into the living area, hands behind her back, and gave the man stood with Lilia by the fire an acknowledging nod.</p><p>“Good day, sir.”</p><p>The man was older, broad and balding, with a pair of wire spectacles perched on his nose. He stepped towards Rio and held out his hand.</p><p>“Captain Vidal. I’m Davis. Todd Davis. You returned a ledger to my colleague, Mr Shade.”</p><p>“I did.” Rio shook the man’s hand firmly. “As any good gentleman would do.”</p><p>“You would hope so,” Mr Davis mused. “Though I must thank you. You saved us from being in quite a bit of trouble with our bookkeeping.”</p><p>“You are very welcome, Mr Davis.”</p><p>“Victor also told me you corrected some mistakes made within the ledger.”</p><p>“Yes, but you can’t blame him. I just have a good eye for numbers.”</p><p>“Oh no, I don’t blame him, Captain Vidal. That ledger, though in his possession when he was attacked, were not his notations. They were mine.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “Oh?”</p><p>“Yes, and I was impressed with how you not only spotted the mistakes but made the corrections. Hence why I have come here. I would like you to come work for me while you’re in town. Stop by the shop now and then to check everything is in order. I have several ventures, you see, and I want to have all my documentation in order. I will pay you handsomely for your time, of course. More than you will make captaining a voyage back to England. So what do you say?”</p><p>Rio looked over Mr Davis’s shoulder to Lilia, who nodded encouragingly.</p><p>“It would be my honour,” Rio answered.</p><p>“Excellent. Stop by the shop in the next few days and Victor will show you the ropes.” He shook Rio’s hand again. “A pleasure to have you join us, dear boy. A pleasure!”</p><p>Once Mr Davis left, Lilia watched him from the window before looking to Rio with an excited gleam in her eyes. “You are one lucky chap. The richest man in town just offered you a job!”</p><p>“Who knew all those years of math classes would one day come in handy,” Rio joked, before clearing her throat. “So, I was thinking about what we read yesterday…”</p><p>“Ah yes.” Lilia clasped her hands together. “I want to try something.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“I want you to try cast some spells for me.”</p><p>“Spells?”</p><p>Lilia nodded. “To see what type of witch you are. If you’re up for it?”</p><p>“Alright,” Rio agreed. “But I don’t think any of it will work.”</p><p>“We shall see.”</p><p>As expected, Rio was right. She couldn’t read tarot or tealeaves, she couldn’t grasp water magic, and her attempt at fire magic almost caused her to lose her eyebrows.</p><p>The last task was earth magic, and so Rio knelt on the ground, staring at the spot she’d planted the apple seed no more than a couple of hours before. She had marked the spot with a twig, as any seasoned grower would, though she hadn’t expected the indicator to be needed so soon.</p><p>“Hold your hand against the earth, above where you planted the seed,” Lilia instructed, and Rio did as she was told. Her palm flat against the soil, she looked to Lilia expectantly.</p><p>“Close your eyes,” Lilia continued, “and imagine channelling energy from yourself to the seed. Imagine it growing, imagine it thriving.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes and did just that. She conjured images of strong branches, vibrant leaves, and succulent, juicy apples. Apples good enough to sink your teeth into.</p><p>Agatha with the apple.</p><p>Agatha taking a bite, a trickle of juice running down her chin…</p><p>She sighed and pulled her hand away. “This is hopeless, Lilia. I don’t have magic.”</p><p>“You might,” Lilia insisted. “Just not in a traditional sense.”</p><p>Rio stood up defeatedly. It was all pointless. Perhaps she needed to reside to the fact she wasn’t going to get home this way. That perhaps the existence of magic in Salem had nothing to do with her getting here. That perhaps it was science that ruled the day. Or that, maybe, this was all in her head. Regardless, every option left her hopeless and homesick.</p><p>“There is usually a bit of a party on market day,” Lilia informed her. “When the traders replace their goods for instruments. Why don’t you go?”</p><p>“Will Agatha be there?” Rio found herself asking.</p><p>“Where else is she going to steal money purses?”</p><p>Rio laughed at the image of everyone dancing happily while Agatha filled her pockets full of coins. “Alright. It sounds like fun. Will you come too?”</p><p>“Oh no. I will be here reading more into this problem of yours. Just don’t be out too late. Agatha may be able to protect herself but seeing as you keep neglecting to wear your pistol, I don’t like the idea of you returning in the dark.”</p><p>“I don’t like guns,” Rio told her. “Never have.”</p><p>Lilia shook her head and got to her feet. Rio watched her leave the room and wondered if she’d offended her, yet the witch soon returned with an object in her hands.</p><p>She held a sheathed dagger out to her. “Better?”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Much.”</p><p> </p><p>The marketplace, not long ago filled with shouting venders and enthusiastic bartering, was now filled with laughter and the sound of drums and strings. Rio walked along the edge, watching the people danced. It wasn’t co-ordinated, not like in the high court period dramas she had seen on TV. No, this was dance at its purest. People not caring, just allowing the music to carry them away. Some danced alone, or with a group, and others with partners. It seemed this was also a place for courting. Men stepped up to women stood along the edge, asking for their hand, most refusing while others accepted with bright blushes on their cheeks.</p><p>As Rio walked, she felt the hopeful gazes of young women and ambitious mothers watching her closely. Did they care that she clearly had no fortune? Or was the prospect of marrying a seafaring adventurer too riveting to care for comfort and consistency?</p><p>“Captain Vidal!”</p><p>She looked round to see Victor Shade walking towards her. He was linked arms with a beautiful redhead, with the most shimmering green eyes Rio had ever seen.</p><p>“Mr Shade.” Rio bowed her head. “A pleasure to see you again.”</p><p>“Please, Rio, call me Victor. I wished to introduce you to my wife,” he explained. “Lady Wanda Maximoff.”</p><p>The redhead stared at her, her head tilted slightly, eyes narrowed like she trying to work out a puzzle. Then, like a flick of a switch, she chuckled. “I’m no longer a lady, Victor.”</p><p>“You are to me.” Victor kissed the crown of her head. “I want to introduce you to the man who returned Mr Davis’s ledger, and dare I say my new business partner?”</p><p>“I have agreed to help,” Rio supplied. “I won’t be much use, though.”</p><p>“Oh, you will be,” Victor grinned. “I look forward to working with you.”</p><p>“Shall we sit?” Wanda suggested, gesturing to the stools that had been brought out for the festivities. They sat down together, and Rio took off her hat, resting it on her lap.</p><p>“So, tell me, Captain,” Wanda spoke up again. “Where have you travelled to?”</p><p>“Here, there, and everywhere,” Rio answered. “The world is my oyster.”</p><p>Victor laughed. “A man who has studied Shakespeare. I had the privilege of reading his plays at university. What a man!”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Oh I have too! Greatly, in fact. What is your favourite work of his?”</p><p>“Hamlet,” Victor answered. “Yourself?”</p><p>“Much Ado About Nothing,” Rio answered. “I’m a bit of a romantic. I also like Twelfth Night.”</p><p>“Good choices,” Victor praised. “So, tell me, what other writings have you studied in your travels?”</p><p>“Not many of note. I have heard poems by the Ancient Greek poet, Sappho, but the rest are mostly songs. Folk tales. Those are what exist on the seven seas.”</p><p>“Would you tell us a story of your own adventures?” Wanda asked. “I’m sure you have many.”</p><p>“Oh, he does.”</p><p>They all looked up to see Agatha stood over them, her eyes fixed on Rio.</p><p>“Agatha,” she greeted. “Good evening.”</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Agatah questioned, arms folded. “Where’s Lilia?”</p><p>“She wanted to stay at home,” Rio explained. “But told me to come have a nice time, and I am.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, clearly unpleased. Rio wasn’t sure why.</p><p>“Agatha.” Wanda patted the empty stool beside her. “Come join us.”</p><p>Rio leaned back as Agatha pushed by her and watched her shift the stool into the gap between her and Wanda.</p><p>“So you have heard some of Rio’s stories?” Victor asked, and Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Oh, they are certainly riveting.” Agatha looked to Rio with a challenging stare. “Right, Captain?”</p><p>Rio stared back at her. Why was she torturing her like this? Had she done something wrong? Or was this just Agatha’s way of showing affection?</p><p>Three sets of eyes stared at her expectantly. Her mind raced, desperate to come up with something. Something epic, something exciting. Something that would work. In the end, she took a gamble.</p><p>“Have you ever heard of the Curse of the Black Pearl?”</p><p>They all shook their heads.</p><p>“Well, it all began in the Caribbean…”</p><p>….she may have gotten little carried away.</p><p>“I stood before him,” she said over the music. “The feared Captain Barbossa. I had to distract him. Elizabeth was freeing my men, and Will was trying to return the last medallion to the chest. To end this evil once and for all.”</p><p>Her audience had grown. From intrigued adults to children sat at her feet, mesmerised by the tale of impossible adventure. Though in their minds, it was all real, perhaps even in the minds of the adults too. After all, not a year ago they had been plagued with a hysterical fear of witchcraft. The only person who knew it was fiction was Agatha, who had moved back, now watching her from afar with an amused smirk.</p><p>“What did you do?” A young girl asked.</p><p>“We fought. One last stand. Our swords clashed together as we battled through the cave of riches. I may have been younger, but Barbossa was experienced. While I was quicker and sharper, he was skilled and methodical. But all I had to was bide my time. Then he outsmarted me. He kicked me in the stomach, and I fell to the floor. He stood over me, ready to stab his sword through my heart. That’s when I knew, it was now or never…”</p><p>The children sat up, eyes wide with anticipation, and Rio noticed the adults lean in also.</p><p>“I pulled my pistol and shot him through the heart.”</p><p>The crowd gasped.</p><p>“But he can’t die!” another child cried.</p><p>“He thought that too,” Rio continued. “Laughed in my face. But I wasn’t looking at him. I was watching Will, stood at the chest, dropping in the last coin. His blood breaking the curse.”</p><p>Another gasp ran through the crowd, one of relief and excitement.</p><p>“Barbossa fell to the ground, his wound now mortal, and death finally claimed him.”</p><p>The crowd applauded, Victor and Wanda leading the charge and Rio stood, taking off her hat to bow. Her eyes looked to find Agatha’s, hoping to catch her reaction. Yet there was none.</p><p>She saw Ralph Bohner had made his way over to her.</p><p>“And what of Will and Elizabeth?” one of the kids, questioned. “Did they marry?”</p><p>“They tried,” Rio said, her eyes fixed on the interaction before her. Ralph tried to take Agatha’s hand, but she pulled it away.</p><p>“Tried?” someone questioned. “What happened?”</p><p>“Another adventure for another day.” Rio put her hat on one of the children’s heads. “Watch that for me a moment, kid.”</p><p>The child grinned and bowed their head, before running off with their friends in toe. In that moment, Rio didn’t care if she didn’t see it again. Her mind was focused on one thing only.</p><p>She excused herself from her audience and made her way over to Agatha.</p><p>“One dance,” she heard Ralph plead. “Just one and I’ll leave you alone.”</p><p>“I want you to leave me alone now,” Agatha sassed. “I will not dance with you.”</p><p>Ralph’s face twisted with anger. “Why the bloody hell not?”</p><p>“Because she’s promised to dance with me,” Rio cut it. “I just got side-tracked. I apologise, my lady. People do love my stories.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a grateful smile. “It’s perfectly fine, Captain.”</p><p>“Shall we get to it?” Rio took Agatha’s hand and Ralph on the back as she past. “Sorry, mate. Maybe next time.”</p><p>She led Agatha away, waiting until she was sure Ralph was out of earshot before looking to her. “You okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha huffed. “You shouldn’t have come here. That story was totally reckless.”</p><p>“You encouraged it.”</p><p>“Not the point. Did you make that up?”</p><p>“No, it’s from a movie.”</p><p>“A what?”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Never mind.”</p><p>She led Agatha into the middle of the space, surrounded by those dancing to the merry jig.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Are we actually dancing?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Rio, I can’t dance.”</p><p>“Anyone can dance,” Rio assured. “Just follow my lead.”</p><p>“Rio, I can’t do this.”</p><p>“You can.” Rio put Agatha’s free hand on her shoulder before placing hers on the woman’s back. She brought Agatha closer. “This okay?”</p><p>Agatha stared up at her and nodded.</p><p>“Don’t think,” Rio told her. “Just trust me.”</p><p>She moved for both of them, skipping round and round while the drums beat fast and the string instruments sang an excitable tune. Agatha clung to her, tightly at first before Rio felt her relax. Soon, their feet were working together, clumsily at first, but soon in unison.</p><p>Then Agatha’s laughter caught her ear. Not the cruel laugh, not the devious laugh. No, this one was higher, lighter, with adorable little snorts and wheezes. Rio joined her and soon they were spinning around fast, weaving dangerously through the other dancers, chasing the thrill.</p><p>Rio saw a pair pull apart, only to link arms and spin round and round in a circle. She did the same, spotting Agatha’s disappointment at their separation, before she clocked on what was happening. With another giggle, she linked their arms, and they pan round and round, only stopping to change direction.  Until dizziness got the better of them, that is and Rio reluctantly pulled apart.</p><p>She wasn’t done though. She grinned at Agatha and did her best imitation of a tap dance in front of her.  In Rio’s head, she was Fred Astaire, but from the way Agatha laughed, she probably looked more like a court jester.</p><p>Then to her delight, Agatha did the same, lifting her skirt enough to show the tapping movements of her feet. They laughed together, not caring about the eyes fixed on them, and danced like they were the only two people in the world.</p><p>She loved this side of Agatha. The one who laughed with such delight that all the sass and defensiveness disappeared.</p><p>Rio wanted to try something, she crossed their arms, holding on tight as she spun them round and round. Agatha looked Rio’s eyes as the world around them went blurry, laughing as her hair fell across her face.</p><p>“Rio, don’t.”</p><p>“Scream if you want to go faster!” Rio grinned back at her before crying out, spinning them more and more.</p><p>Agatha screamed too, her eyes closed but with a huge grin on her face. It was one of the most beautiful sights Rio had ever seen.</p><p>Eventually, it was too much, and Rio slowed them down, catching Agatha in her arms. They stood there for a moment as they caught their bearings, laughing breathlessly.</p><p>Agatha looked up at her with a dizzy grin. “That was the best dance ever.”</p><p>“Have you danced before?”</p><p>“Not really,” Agatha admitted. “But I liked it.”</p><p>“Want to go again?”</p><p>Before Agatha could answer, a voice cut through the air.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>Agatha tensed, and Rio looked to see Evanora Harkness approaching them.</p><p>Rio bowed to her. “A pleasure to see you again, ma’am.”</p><p>“I cannot say the same, Captain. Though I know this was likely no fault of yours.” The woman snapped her fingers at Agatha. “Come along.”</p><p>Agatha looked to Rio as her mother stormed off. “Meet me by the river tomorrow at noon?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha managed a smile before she followed her mother out of the marketplace.</p><p>Rio went to sit back down on her stool beside Victor. Wanda was stood a short distance away, talking to a group of women, all laughing away. It seemed she was more of a social butterfly than her husband.</p><p>“Looks like you two had fun,” Victor commented.</p><p>“Yeah, we did,” Rio replied, before smiling as the kids ran back to her with the hat. She accepted it and placed it back on her head. “Thanks, kids. Now go dance!”</p><p>The kids grinned and ran off.</p><p>“Do you have any kids?” Victor asked her, and Rio laughed sharply.</p><p>“Not that I’m aware of. What about you?”</p><p>“Wanda and I have tried, but nothing yet. Wanda wishes to take on wards when we’re more settled. Orphans from one of the bigger settlements. Give them a home and an education.”</p><p>Rio smiled at that. Growing up without a family was hard enough in the future, let alone in this period. At least people <em>pretended</em> to care about her as she grew up.</p><p>“So, what’s this idea of yours that’s gotten the whole town hating your guts?” Rio asked, changing the subject. “The one you wouldn’t tell me about when we met.”</p><p>Victor bowed his head shily. “It’s more of a hypothesis. I came to Harvard to study it further, but I met Wanda, and I could no longer be the bachelor scholar I once was. Wanda wished to settle here, and so I must follow this alone. Without a fellow academic mind, I am stumped, and the townsfolk just aren’t interested. They just think I’m nutty.”</p><p>“I don’t,” Rio offered. “What is it about? This hypothesis.”</p><p>“I want to find a way of harnessing a natural source to generate energy,” he explained. “It could help revolutionise our way of life.”</p><p>Rio studied him closely. “What kind of natural source?”</p><p>Victor gave her an eager grin. “Lightning.”</p>

<p>Lilia woke her up the next morning.</p><p>“There’s an apple tree in my garden.”</p><p>Rio threw on some clothes and headed out to see for herself. Sure enough, an apple tree stood tall in the cottage garden, flourished with leaves and fruit ready for picking. She stared up at it in awe. “How…”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “It seems we found out what kind of which you are.”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>“Look.” Lilia gestured to the tree. “You’re a green witch.”</p><p>Rio studied the tree again, before stepping forward and pulling an apple from a lower branch. She examined it a moment, before taking a hearty bite. It was the most succulent apple she had ever tasted, just how she liked it and more!</p><p>“Well Agatha will be happy. Now she can have fresh apples on tap!”</p><p>“We need to cut it down.”</p><p>Rio looked back at Lilia. “What? Why?”</p><p>“If people see a tree suddenly appearing in my garden, they’ll carry me off to the lake. There are still people suspicious of witchcraft round these parts, and this is like waving a grand flag announcing our presence.”</p><p>“It’s just an apple tree. Would anyone even notice?”</p><p>“We can’t take the risk,” Lilia picked up a pail. “Now let’s collect all these and I’ll find you an axe.”</p><p>“Me?” Rio looked at the tree, thriving and beautiful. It was a mighty shame its short life would be (literally) cut short, let alone for it to be at her hand.</p><p>“You’re the green witch here,” Lilia told her. “It’s your duty to-”</p><p>Lilia paused, her eyes glazed for a moment, before looking at Rio with wide eyes. “Rio?”</p><p>“Lilia? Are you okay?”</p><p>“You’re still here?”</p><p>“Yes, where else would I be?”</p><p>“Rio, you need to get back to A-“</p><p>Lilia blinked again, her eyes now lost.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Lilia?” she asked again cautiously.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>“I don’t know. You told me to get back somewhere?”</p><p>Lilia quickly waved it off. “Excuse an old psychic. My mind gets jumbled sometimes. Now collect all those apples. I’ll make them into a pie.”</p><p>Rio did as she was told but snuck one in her pocket before handing the pail over to Lilia. She swore she would cut down the tree in the afternoon, but the look on Lilia’s face showed her doubt. Perhaps it was the ‘green witch’ in her, but Rio hated to see a healthy tree cut down. Especially when it was her fault it grew up too fast.</p><p>At noon, she told Lilia she was going for a walk and headed down to the river. As she promised, Agatha was there waiting for her. She was looking out at the river, and Rio couldn’t help but marvel at the way her long hair waved in the breeze.</p><p>Agatha must have heard her approach as she looked round to face her. “You made it.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio reached into her pocket. “I have something for you.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head curiously. “You do?”</p><p>Rio held the apple out to her. “Freshly grown this morning.”</p><p>She watched Agatha’s curiosity manifest into a frown. “How?”</p><p>“My magic, I guess,” Rio admitted, though she didn’t quite believe it herself. “Lilia says I’m a green witch.”</p><p>Agatha let out a snort of laughter. “How embarrassing for you.”</p><p>“If it’s so embarrassing, I’ll keep the apple,” Rio said, making a show of moving it back to her pocket.</p><p>“Wait, no. I would still like to try it.”</p><p>“Enjoy the fruits of my labour,” Rio joked as she handed the apple over. “I picked the best one for you.”</p><p>Agatha examined the fruit before taking a strong bite. Rio’s focus latched on the glisten of juice shimmering on her lower lip as she chewed, and the small glimpse of tongue that licked it away.</p><p>“Wow.” Agatha looked to the bitten apple in wonder. “I swear I have never tasted anything so sweet.”</p><p>“Well enjoy it while you can,” Rio told her. “Lilia wants me to cut down the tree this afternoon, so it doesn’t get noticed.”</p><p>“That’s probably the sensible thing to do,” Agatha noted. “It’s a shame, though.”</p><p>“It is, but Lilia is making apple pie later. You should come have some.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped to her feet. “Rio, I ca…I think we need to keep our distance for a while.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio questioned. “W-why would we need to do that?”</p><p>“Because people are talking about last night. My mother is furious.”</p><p>“Why? Because we danced?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “She’s called me a harlot twice this morning, which I usually wouldn’t mind. She’s called me worse. Yet now is not the time to be drawing attention to ourselves. You don’t need it, and I certainly don’t.”</p><p>“Can’t a man dance with a woman in this time?” Rio questioned. “How else would courting work?”</p><p>“It’s not that.”</p><p>“Then what is it?” Rio demanded. “Because I want to know why I can’t see one of the only people here I can actually talk to in this hellhole.”</p><p>“It’s complicated.”</p><p>“Can’t a man…”</p><p>“But you’re not a man,” Agatha snapped. “That’s the problem.”</p><p>Rio’s confusion deepened. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Agatha sighed, her shoulders slumped in defeat. “Look, we can’t be so friendly because people will notice, and people will talk. Then when there is no marriage and you disappear, people will assume I gave you what all men want and you just upped and left, and my mother will tighten her grasp on me, and I’ll never be able to leave.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“You’ll ruin me, Rio. Do you understand that?”</p><p>Rio stared back at her, thousand thoughts running through her mind.</p><p>“Fine.” She held up her hands. “I’ll leave you alone.”</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“But,” Rio stepped up to her, their faces inches apart, “I think there’s more to this than you’re saying.”</p><p>“There isn’t,” Agatha said quickly, yet Rio caught it. Saw the way her eyes flickered around her face as she bit her lip.</p><p>Rio cocked her head. “Are you sure?”</p><p>“Yes, I’m sure,” Agatha snapped. “And whatever it is that you’re insinuating is none of your concern, Captain. Focus less on me and more on getting yourself home because you’ve been nothing but trouble since the moment you arrived.”</p><p>Rio stared her down, waiting for this hard exterior to crumble. So she could see the Agatha she saw the night before. The one who smiled and laughed. Whose blue eyes shimmered so brightly.<br/>Yet only the coldness remained, and Rio accepted defeat.</p><p>“Okay Agatha.” She stepped away from her. “But this isn’t all about me.”</p><p>With that, Rio stormed off through the trees, navigating her way back to Lilia’s cottage. When she got there, she spotted an axe propped up against the tree- Lilia’s idea of a physical prompt.<br/>Rio picked up the axe and swung it into the thick trunk. She hit it over and over, wanting it gone. Wanting her magic gone, wanting this stupid town and century gone, and she wanted her fixation on Agatha Harkness be fucking <em>gone</em>.</p><p>Soon the tree fell, and Rio began chopping it into smaller pieces. Eventually she calmed enough to gather her bearings and sensed a presence behind her. She looked to see Lilia watching her closely.</p><p>Rio wasn’t in the mood. She dropped the axe and walked past her to the house.</p><p>“Plenty of firewood for you,” she said, before disappearing inside.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, the tree was back.</p><p>“What a stubborn thing,” Lilia commented, before handing over the axe. Rio took it without question, and the tree met the same fate as its predecessor.</p><p>Rio headed into town and made her way to Mr Davis’s shop. When she walked in, the man himself was stood at the counter, Victor beside him as they both rummaged through a pile of papers. They looked up when she entered, and Mr Davis smiled.</p><p>“Here he is! Captain Vidal, you came at the right time.”</p><p>Rio took of her hat and coat, placing them on the coat stand by the door. She approached and looked at the papers before her. “What’s all this?”</p><p>“The documentation for a property I own,” Mr Davis explained. “The tenants has died, and his son claims that the land should then belongs to him in full. I’d offer to continue renting it, but I find him quite unfavourable. I’ve informed him it is my property, and I don’t intend to just give it away.”</p><p>Rio frowned. This guy must be an asshole. “So what’s the problem?”</p><p>“His argument is his father paid the value of the property through his rent, but I’m dubius of this. He paid a reduced rent as the house is a bit of a mess. It was meant to be my son’s, but they decided to stay in Boston, and my wife insisted I leave it in case they change their mind. Eventually, she relented, but by then it needed work. The tenant said he would make improvements, but I have noticed no such modifications. Still, I would like to know for sure whether he did indeed pay the sum of the property.”</p><p>Victor handed her a piece of paper, numbers scrawled all over it. “We calculated what the land was bought for with the additional costs of building the house. Luckily we record rent payments by property, but it’ll take us hours to calculate.”</p><p>“I can do it,” Rio assured. “But you also need to adjust the property value to the market. I’m assuming as Salem grows and flourishes, the houses more central to town centre will increase in value.”</p><p>“I have records of property sales made in town recently!” Mr Davis said as he walked towards the back. “Let’s take a look!”</p><p>“I told you you’d be a great help,” Victor reminded her, and Rio chuckled.</p><p>“Let’s work this problem out first.”</p><p>Eventually, they gathered the numbers they needed, and Rio said she would take them away and bring back her calculations the next day. It wasn’t like she could spent her nights watching TV and TikTok anymore, and she needed to keep busy.</p><p>(Much of the night before she had spent thinking of Agatha, and of course home. Of Alica and their flower shop in New York, and a life she wished to have back.)</p><p>“Good lad.” Mr Davis handed her a small sack of coins. “There will be more where that came from when you work out all this out.”</p><p>“Thank you, sir.”</p><p>Mr Davis patted him on the back. “Now why don’t both you boys head to the tavern and grab a drink? You’ve both worked hard today.”</p><p>Both Rio and Victor bid their boss farewell, before grabbing their coats and hats and heading out onto the street.</p><p>“If you don’t mind, I’d rather not visit the tavern,” Victor admitted. “Wanda is getting concerned with the number of bruises I’m receiving for someone with a clerical job.”</p><p>“How about we just walk?” Rio suggested. “I’d like to hear more about this lightning idea of yours.”</p><p>An eager smile appeared on Victor’s face. “Well, it’s only a hypothesis, but are you familiar with the concept of static electricity?”</p><p>“Vaguely,” Rio lied. “But what has that got to do with lightning?”</p><p>“When I was a child, I was fascinated by thunderstorms. They used to rage across the sky, and I would watch in wonder. Then, during my studies, a visiting scientist demonstrated an experiment on static electricity. I saw a spark, and I was transported back to my childhood bedroom peering out the window at the bolts filling the sky. I was then fascinated. I travelled to Boston in the hope of meeting similar minds, and we did conduct an experiment, but it didn’t end well.”</p><p>“It didn’t?”</p><p>“We destroyed a lot of expensive apparatus, and the college insisted we find a new line of study.”</p><p>“So what? You couldn’t continue?”</p><p>“I intended to continue behind their back, but then Wanda came along, and my life changed. It was no longer about travelling around, conducting experiments and meeting other academics. It was about making sure she was happy, and that will always be what matters.”</p><p>Rio smiled. Victor was indeed a sweet man. “But you couldn’t quite give it up?”</p><p>Victor chuckled and shook his head. “Now it’s a hobby, one I share alone. Though I suppose, being at sea so much, you saw your fair share of storms.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Enough. Though I was more worried about the big waves than the lightning.”</p><p>“I can imagine, but I wonder if you would indulge me a little. You have a sharp mind and I could do with your expertise.”</p><p>“My expertise?” Rio questioned. “Victor, I’m good with numbers, but I’m not a scientist. What good will I do? Tie the key to the kite so you can actually work out what’s happening?”</p><p>Victor frowned. “A key on a kite?”</p><p>Rio looked down. Fuck, fuck, fuck! That wasn’t going to happen until the next century!</p><p>“It’s an expression,” Rio insisted, but Victor wasn’t listening. He was lost in contemplation.</p><p>“That’s actually an interesting idea,” he noted. “Where did you hear of this?”</p><p>“I…” Rio was about to answer when she spotted something out of the cover of her eye. Or rather, someone.</p><p>Agatha was walking on the other side of the street, one hand carrying a bucket full of water, while trying to balance a load of firewood under her arm with the other. Rio could see it was too much for her, and despite the high emotions of the day before, she hated to see her struggle.</p><p>“Will you excuse me, Victor.” She bowed her hat. “I see a lady in need.”</p><p>Rio rushed across the street to meet her. “Need a hand?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare. “Go away, Rio.”</p><p>“I’m not trying anything but I’m not letting you carry all this by yourself.” Rio took the bucket from her. “If it makes you feel better, I’ll walk two paces behind.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips with disdain, but Rio could see she was relived to lose a bit of the load. She didn’t say a word, just walked on, and Rio followed. </p><p>They made it to the end of the street before Rio had enough and moved to walk beside her. “I don’t mean to make things complicated for you.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha admitted. “But you are.”</p><p>“I don’t like the way your mother is with you. I wish there was something I could do to help.”</p><p>“The only thing you can do is keep your head down. I hope to soon have a way out of town, and then I’ll have my freedom. For now, I need to bear it.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t imagine a woman like Agatha accepting someone else controlling her, berating her, treating her like a pack mule. Though perhaps that was why Agatha was the way she was; fighting the rest of the world because she couldn’t fight her mother<em>. </em></p><p>When they reached the corner of a next street, Agatha stopped and adjusted the firewood under her arm.  “Mother can’t see you.”</p><p>Rio nodded and held the bucket out to her. “As long as you can manage.”</p><p>Agatha went to take the bucket, the sleeve of her dress riding up slightly as she reached out. </p><p>That’s when Rio saw it. </p><p>A purple bruise on her wrist, only a day or so old. Rio had seen that kind of bruise before.</p><p>“Agatha, what the fuck is that?”</p><p>Agatha pulled her hand back and pulled down her sleeve. “Nothing.”</p><p>“It’s not nothing,” Rio insisted. “Who did this to you? Was it her?” </p><p>“Enough, Rio.” Agatha reached for the bucket again, this time with her right hand. She yanked it out of Rio’s grasp, causing some of its contents to splash on the ground. “Just leave me alone.” </p><p>Rio watched her walk away. She wanted to stop her, to drop to her knees before her and beg that she come back to Lilia’s. To never go near that woman again. The woman who seemed to diminish the fire she had found so endearing.</p><p>She knew the type. Growing up in the system, she had bounced around enough to know people like this. People who held deep hatred for no reason, out of resentment or from the delusion of some badness they’d seen within someone so young and innocent. It seemed for Agatha, it was a combination of both. And there wasn’t much she could do about it. Not in this day and age.</p><p>Rio reached into her pocket, her fingers brushing against the cool brass of the cameo locket. Perhaps a plan would come to her in time, but for now it alluded her.</p><p>She waited until she saw Agatha push her way into a small house down the street, a house of horrors disguised as a quaint cottage. There was a painful twang in her chest when she disappeared inside, but Rio knew she couldn’t loiter, and so she walked away.</p><p>Later, however, as she and Lilia sat by the fire, she working on her work from Mr Davis while Lilia read through another old book, she brought up the subject again.</p><p>“Why does Agatha’s mother hate her?”</p><p>Lilia didn’t even look up from the book. “Evanora Harkness is a resentful old bat.”</p><p>“But why? Surely she must love her own daughter?”</p><p>Lilia sighed and closed the book. “Rio, even if Agatha wasn’t...the way she is, Evanora would still find a reason to hate her.”</p><p>“Wait, does she know Agatha is a witch?”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “Of course she does. Who do you think Agatha inherited her magic from? She’s head of a local coven, one that respects magic but is also devout to the Bible’s teachings. Agatha is also a part of the coven, though she has been banned from gatherings for her sharp tongue and contrasting beliefs.”</p><p>“Did she just not want a daughter?”</p><p>“She didn’t want a child,” Lilia told her. “But she got swept away in a whirlwind romance, and Agatha was the result. Her father vanished, and Evanora was left unwed and with child. If it hadn’t been for her open search for repentance, she would have been rejected by the community. Even now, her standing is not high, and Agatha’s small rebellions aren’t helping. She wishes for Agatha to marry someone wealthy, with high prospects, mostly so she is no longer her problem, but also to raise her own standing. Until that time, she treats her poorly, but Agatha is strong. We plan to leave, but we need money, and...”</p><p>“Whatever power got me here,” Rio finished, finally understanding.</p><p>Lilia nodded. “Evanora won’t let her leave without a fight.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t she want rid of her?”</p><p>“Not like that,” Lilia said. “Not without Agatha returning what she ‘took’. Her reputation.”</p><p>“She hurt her,” Rio said. “I saw the bruise.”</p><p>Lilia opened her book again and began to read. “Unless you wish to marry her yourself, Captain, there is little we can do.”</p><p>Rio looked back at the numbers on the paper before her, all of them blurring in her mind. She imagined Agatha in an elegant dress, and her in her best captain attire, stood at an alter, exchanging vows. It would be easy, but it wouldn’t be right. Agatha deserved to marry someone she loved, and not someone who could disappear at a moment’s notice. Still, the idea went round and round in her mind as she crunched numbers well into the night. </p><p>She must have fallen asleep in the chair as the next thing she knew it was day, and Lilia was standing over her. </p><p>“Did you stay here all night?” </p><p>Rio sat up with a groan and stretched her arms, before gathering up the papers that had since fallen onto the floor. “What time is it?”</p><p>“Barely dawn,” Lilia told her. “And the tree is back.”</p><p>“Again?” Rio pulled herself to her feet. “Guess we won’t be without firewood for a while.”</p><p>“No, we should leave it now,” Lilia decided. “Whatever magic you used is stubborn. If anyone questions it, we shall say it’s its first bloom. Perhaps, I can even sell some apples in town. An extra half penny here and there would do just nicely.”</p><p>Rio grabbed an apple off the tree for breakfast and bit into it while going over the numbers again. Everything seemed right, and so she put it in the pocket of her coat and headed back into town. </p><p>When she got to the shop, Mr Davis was there, flipping through a large ledger. He looked up when she entered and smiled. “Captain, what’s the verdict?”</p><p>“I’ve double checked to be sure, but he was nowhere near paying the value of the property when you bought it, let alone now.”</p><p>She handed over the papers and Mr Davis began to examine them. “Good work, my boy. Good work.”</p><p>Rio looked around. “Where’s Victor?”</p><p>Mr Davis frowned. “I don’t know. He went out a while ago to deliver a letter for me, but he hasn’t returned. I wonder what’s caught him up? I do hope it’s not those men again. They really are scoundrels.”</p><p>“I’ll go look for him,” Rio assured. “Hopefully he’s just bumped into Wanda or something.”</p><p>Rio headed off in the direction of the tavern. Surely he hadn’t gone in there after last time? Was this man just a glutton for punishment?</p><p>She made it to the marketplace when she heard it. Shouting, bellowing, scandalised gasps. It seemed she’d managed to find Victor.</p><p>Rio rushed ahead and pushed her way through the jeering crowd. In the middle was Victor, a bit dishevelled but not visibly hurt, with Raph Bohner waving his fist at him.</p><p>She also noticed a particular witch in a purple dress stood opposite her, but her focus was needed elsewhere.</p><p>“It’s my house!” Ralph cried. “My father left it to me.”</p><p>“It wasn’t his to leave,” Victor told him calmly. “Look, really it’s nothing to do with...”</p><p>“My father put all his money into that house,” Ralph barked. “He paid the value of that house ten times over. It should be mine!”</p><p>He lunged for Victor, but Rio jumped in, getting between them. “Okay, guys. Enough.” </p><p>“Get out of the way, Captain,” Ralph snapped. “This has nothing to do with you.”</p><p>“Actually, it does.” Rio stepped up to him. “If you’re going to fight anyone over this, fight me. Mr Davis asked me to go over the accounts. You have no right to anything.”</p><p>Ralp looked her up and down. “Since when are you working for him?”</p><p>“He has offered me some work, though I don’t see how it has anything to do with you.”</p><p>“So you’re staying here? Really staying?”</p><p> “For now.” Rio stole a glance at Agatha and saw she was watching on with notable concern.</p><p>Ralph laughed bitterly. “I knew it.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Knew what?”</p><p>He pointed an accusing finger at her. “There’s something not right about you, Vidal. You talk about your exploits at sea and your love for adventure, yet you’re here. Staying in an old spinster’s house, parading around in that stupid hat like you’re fucking special. Well, I see right through it.”</p><p>She rolled her eyes. “You’re talking nonsense, Bohner.”</p><p>“Oh am I?” he questioned. “You cheated at cards that day, I know it, and that story about you and the cursed treasure is pure and practised bullshit. That either makes you a conman or spy for the French!”</p><p>A gasp rang through the crowd.</p><p>Rio scoffed. “I’m no conman, and do I look French to you?”</p><p>Ralph looked her up and down with disgust. “I’m not sure what you are, but all I know is you’re lying.”</p><p>Rio glanced around the crowd and saw other suspicious eyes on her. Her eyes soon met Agatha’s, whose piercing blue eyes stared back at her, wide with fear. She knew this is how it started last time; with baseless accusations and false insinuations.</p><p>Only these weren’t baseless. Rio was lying, and the truth would get them all killed.</p><p>“I’m not lying,” she insisted. “Why would I lie?”</p><p>“Why else would you stay?” Ralph accused. “Why find work and settle yourself in? After all the places you’ve been in the world, or so you say, why here? Why Salem?”</p><p>Rio’s mind raced. She could go with logic, that she needed time to recover from life at sea. Yet that wouldn’t work, not with a crowd eager for dramatics. No, she had to sell a good story, one that would invest the attention of the townsfolk and dismiss all of Ralph’s accusations.</p><p>She faced the crowd, holding out her arms. “Well, I guess I will have to admit that there is a reason for me staying. Not to steal, or to spy. No, I’m staying for a more important reason.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, who had folded her arms expectantly. She would apologise to her later, but for now, she had to do this.</p><p>“You see, I have been all over the world. I’ve seen beautiful places and met beautiful people. Salem is not a paradise, nor is it filled with excitement and adventure, yet I cannot leave. You see, in all those years, I have never known love. True love, that captures your heart and soul, binding you to them forever. I thought my true love was the sea, but then I arrived here, and saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. Now, I can’t bare to leave, as a day not seeing her face is one I don’t wish to live.”</p><p>She could see the hopeful looks in the crowd, from young ladies and their ambitious mothers. After all, the recipient of this declaration would be the most talked-about woman in town. Yet there was only ever one woman Rio could choose, and so she stepped towards her.</p><p>Agatha gave her a warning look, but Rio continued. It was too late to back out even if she wanted to. She dropped to her knees before her and reached into her coat pocket.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, I love you with all my heart.” She pulled out the locket and held it up to her. “Would you consider becoming my wife?”</p>

<p>Rio stared up at Agatha. The witch’s face was one of shock, but she couldn’t read much else. Was she upset? Was she mad? Was she an internal ball of pure fury? Knowing Agatha, she would turn her into a toad there and then, consequences be damned. </p><p>Yet to her surprise, Agatha reached down and took the locket. “My dear Captain, I accept your heart, and if you ask my mother’s permission, you may have my hand.”</p><p>The crowd gasped and applauded, swept up by the love story unfolding before them. Rio, however, was at a total loss. Was she now...engaged? Like actually engaged? To Agatha?</p><p>Oh fuck, what had she done?</p><p>“No!” Ralph protested. “Agatha, you can’t possibly what to marry him?!”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha declared. “I happen to be quite fond of the captain in turn, and I must say he’s the finest man to have ever graced this town of,” she looked Ralph up and down in disgust, “monstrosities.”</p><p>Rio got to her feet and held her hand out to Ralph. “Can we call a truce?”</p><p>Ralph smacked her hand away. “I’m going to Boston to stay with my cousin for a short time. We’ll see how your fortunes are when I return, Captain Vidal.”</p><p>“And may they be merry,” Victor interjected. “As my friend is about to be wed!”</p><p>As the crowd cheered and Ralph Bohner sloped back to the shadows where he belonged, Agatha made a show of linking arms with her. “Come, we must speak to my mother at once.”</p><p>The ladies giggled, their jealously replaced with a desire to be a part of what was set to be the town’s hottest topic of conversation, while the men patted Rio on the back in congratulations. They both played their part with smiles and laughter, before making their way out of the marketplace. It was then Agatha pulled away from her.</p><p>“Mother won’t be happy,” she commented. “But she’ll agree, even just to get rid of me.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “I’m really asking her?”</p><p>“How else are we meant to get married?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “Wait, you actually want to?”</p><p>“Want is a very strong word,” Agatha replied. “However, since you used me to get out of a sticky situation, I’d like to do the same. I marry you and I gain my freedom.”</p><p>“But I thought marriage was complicated for you?” Rio questioned. “Why would marrying me...”</p><p>“It would only be a marriage of convenience,” Agatha reminded her. “A sham. We will marry and keep up appearances and when you find your way home, I will say you went on a voyage and was lost at sea. Then, I will spend the rest of my life insisting I could never marry another. It’s the perfect plan.”</p><p>A bit too perfect, Rio mused. It seemed someone had already thought this through.</p><p>They soon reached the cottage Agatha shared with her mother. It was a world away from Lilia’s welcoming and blossoming home. Everything was plain, with nothing but a few small animal pens decorating the front of the house. </p><p>Agatha approached one of the pens and picked up a white speckled rabbit. “Good afternoon, mister.”</p><p>“That one yours?” Rio asked and Agatha nodded, before leading them all into the house.</p><p>“Stay there,” she said as they crossed the threshold. “I’ll tell her you’re here.”</p><p>Rio waited in the doorway as Agatha and the rabbit headed further in. </p><p>“What have I told you about bringing in that rabbit in, girl,” Evanora’s voice boomed through the house. “Next time I’ll cook him into a pie!”</p><p>Agatha seemed to ignore the comment. “Mother, Captain Vidal is here to see you.”</p><p>“Why on earth would he want to see me?” Evanora questioned. “You better not be in any trouble!”</p><p>“I’m not, but he wishes to speak to you.”</p><p>Rio heard Evanora huff. “Fine. Send him through.”</p><p>Agatha returned, holding her rabbit close to her chest. “She’ll see you now. Just be as flamboyant as you were in the marketplace and you’ll be fine.”</p><p>“But what…” she began, but Agatha had already headed back outside, leaving her at the mercy of the big bad wolf in the next room.</p><p>Rio stepped cautiously into the room to find Evanora Harkness sat by the fireplace, idly needlepointing. Like this, she almost resembled a sweet old lady, until she lifted her head, and those hateful eyes fell upon her.</p><p>“Captain Vidal.” She set the needlework aside and gestured to the vacant chair opposite her. Agatha’s, Rio guessed. “Please sit.”</p><p>Rio sat down and took off her hat. “Thank you for speaking with me.”</p><p>“I’m intrigued to hear what you have to say,” Evanora admitted. “After all, what business would you want with me?”</p><p>Rio sucked in a sharp breath. <em>Here goes nothing</em>. “Mrs Harkness, I’m in love with you daughter and would like to ask your permission to marry her.”</p><p>The old woman stared at her for a moment before cackling. “Did Agatha talk you into this? Or bewitch you, perhaps? She is a cruel little thing.”</p><p>“She hasn’t bewitched me,” Rio insisted. “Except with her radiant beauty.”</p><p>The laughter stopped. “Is this actually a serious proposition?”</p><p>Rio held her head high. “It is.”</p><p>After a moment, Evanora’s eyes narrowed. “Have you bedded my daughter, Captain?”</p><p>“WHAT?! No! No, I would never- I mean I wish to make an honest woman of her before any of that!”</p><p>“I’m unsure if I believe you,” Evanora responded. “Though if you have, it seems it only matters in the eyes of God. After all, you have been in town a matter of days. Though I put nothing past my daughter’s sinful ways, with a quick wedding, no one will be any the wiser if any…consequences occur.”</p><p>“So I have your permission?”</p><p>Evanora nodded. “I would like to think you are genuine in your words, Captain. There have been enough bastards in this family, after all.”</p><p>Rio wanted to punch the woman in the face, yet instead she put on a grateful smile. “Thank you, Ma’am.”</p><p>“Don’t thank me yet,” Evanora said with a bitter laugh. “That girl will make you wish you never set foot in this town. Still, I will head to the church this day and ask for a prompt wedding. I’ll say it is in case the sea beckons you again, which I hope it will not until a child is in my daughter’s belly. If there isn’t one already.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding, though she knew the chances of that happening were zero. “I’ll marry her this very moment if I could.”</p><p>“Very well. I shall let you know the date of your nuptials. Please dress in your finest. My daughter will not marry a man of poor appearance.”</p><p>“I will make quick work of it,” Rio said as she got to her feet, and bowed before her future mother-in-law. “May I tell Agatha the news?”</p><p>“You may,” Evanora agreed. “Then be on your way. I must get started on her dress.”</p><p>Rio put her hat back on and rushed from the room. She found Agatha in the yard, still cradling the rabbit.</p><p>“Well?” she asked once Rio reached her. “Did she agree?”</p><p>“She thinks I’ve ‘bedded’ you, but she agreed.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “She always thinks the worst of me. For all her talk of sinfulness, I am in that way much purer than her.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You do know I’m probably more ‘sinful’ than most of this town put together.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebows. “So you have lain with men?”</p><p>“Who said anything about men?” Rio smirked, before walking away to the cottage. “I’ll see you soon, Agatha.”</p><p>There was no response, and Rio suspected she had shocked her silent.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia was delighted. More than delighted. Rio was sure she was going to startle people in Boston by the volume of her hoots and hollers.</p><p>“This is the most perfect news!” She poured them both a glass of wine to celebrate. “How genius of you, my dear!”</p><p>“I just panicked,” Rio told her. “Agatha’s the one who put a plan together.”</p><p>Lilia waved her off. “All that matters is we’re getting Agatha away from that woman, and having her here will certainly help with our efforts to find out how you got here.”</p><p>“And how to get home,” Rio reminded her. Marriage or not, that was always the goal.</p><p>“Yes, yes. Now, I’ll see about getting a bigger bed for your room, though it’ll still be mighty cramped…”</p><p>“I’ll sleep in a chair,” Rio insisted. “Give Agatha the room.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “We’ll see how long that lasts.”</p><p>Rio was about to question what she meant, when there was a knock at the door. Lilia went to open it, and Evanora Harkness strode in without invitation, Agatha close behind her.</p><p>Evanora looked around the cottage with disgust. “So it seems you’ve gotten what you wanted, Lilia. My daughter living under your roof.”</p><p>“Until they find a place of their own,” Lilia reminded her. “Though you know I will love having her here.”</p><p>Evanora cast her a distasteful look before gracing Rio with a curt smile. “Well, Captain Vidal, I have spoken to the reverend, and you will be wedded to my daughter in three days hence.”</p><p>“Three days?!” Rio wanted to throw up. “Isn’t that a little too quick?”</p><p>“Do you wish to marry my daughter or not?” Evanora snapped and Rio quickly nodded. “Then three days. I would like you to call for us tomorrow and I will supervise a walk through the town. That way, we can share the good news, then we must get ourselves ready for the service. I expect you in your finest!”</p><p>“Don’t you worry,” Lilia assured. “He’ll be the most handsome man in town!”</p><p>“He already is,” Agatha said with a wink, earning a look of disgust from her mother.</p><p>“You will watch your tongue, girl. I should be glad your sinful ways will soon end. I’m hoping being a married woman will teach you some much needed discipline.”</p><p>“Like you’d know anything about that,” Agatha bit back, and Evanora gritted her teeth.</p><p>“Home. Now.”</p><p>Agatha blew Rio a kiss before sauntering out of the door, Evanora marching after her. Once the door slammed behind them, Lilia laughed.</p><p>“I haven’t seen her so bold with her mother in a long while.”</p><p>“Well she won’t have to rely on her for much longer,” Rio insisted. “I’ll work hard. Make sure she has something to her name when I’m gone.”</p><p>Lilia patted her on the shoulder. “Being a gentleman suits you.”</p><p>Rio bowed her head. She had to admit, playing the romantic hero was a lot of fun, and she could tell Agatha was embracing the performance also.</p><p>“Keep it up,” Lilia encouraged. “You might be surprised by the outcome.”</p><p>Before Rio could question her words, the older woman handed her a pail full of apples. “Skin these. We’re having pie again.”</p><p> </p><p>She called for the Harkness ladies mid-morning. Evanora had made an effort, having plated her hair and wearing a fine navy cloak. Agatha’s hair on the other hand was as wild as ever, and she had dirt on the skirt of her dress. Rio couldn’t help but smile. There was something endearing about the way Agatha simply didn’t care.</p><p>She wondered what she would look like if they met in her time. What style would Agatha prefer? Would she wear make-up? Would she wear panties or a thong? Okay, maybe her mind was wandering with that last one…she needed someone to hurry up and invent a vibrator already.</p><p>Rio tipped her hat to them. “Good morning.”</p><p>“Indeed it is.” Evanora seemed chipper, which put Rio even more on edge for some reason. “I’ll let you both walk ahead. Though keep your conversations proper and be pleasant.”</p><p>“Of course, Mother.” Agatha moved forward and linked her arm with Rio’s. “Now shall we get this over with?”</p><p>“I didn’t know my company was so much of an inconvenience,” Rio joked, at which Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>“I very much look forward to your company once we’re married, my love.” Agatha hugged her arm. “Especially when we have a home of our own.”</p><p>“Enough.” Evanora waved them on. “Get walking.”</p><p>It wasn’t lost on Rio that her future mother-in-law was parading her around town like a prize stallion, but she tried to find the humour in it. People looked their way, witnessing the subjects of the towns latest gossip pass before their very eyes. Rio bowed her hat to each of them, while Agatha forced a smile.</p><p>“You’d think they’d never seen a betrothed couple before,” Agatha commented. “Idiots.”</p><p>“Hey, they can’t help it,” Rio insisted. “We’re a striking pair.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, but it soon died in her throat. “Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“What did you mean yesterday when you said you hadn’t lain with men?”</p><p>“I haven’t,” Rio admitted.</p><p>“But you have…had relations.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I have.”</p><p>There was a pause before Agatha responded. “With who?”</p><p>“With women.”</p><p>She felt Agatha tense against her, and for a moment she worried that she had misread the situation. After all, her lesbianism would perhaps surpass the witchcraft if it were brought before a judge’s docket.</p><p>Eventually, Agatha found her voice again. “Is that not a sin in your time?”</p><p>“It’s not illegal,” Rio answered. “Some people don’t like it, but I don’t have to hide. I can even marry a woman if I wanted.”</p><p>“You are in two days,” Agatha reminded her, and Rio let out a hearty laugh. It occurred to her then that this was perhaps America’s first sapphic wedding.</p><p>“If only her mother knew how sinful this marriage actually was.” She whispered. “I think she’d catch fire.”</p><p>Agatha let out a bark of laughter. “I would love to see the look on her face. Oh, it would be glorious.”</p><p>Rio chuckled along with her, before she caught sight of two familiar faces walking arm in arm towards them.</p><p>“Rio!” Victor greeted her with a grin. “Congratulations again. To both of you, of course.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio looked at Agatha, who smiled back at her so brightly it was hard not to grin back at her like a fool.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness in love?” Wanda teased. “And with a sailor no less!”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “What can I say? I like the bad boys.”</p><p>It took everything in Rio not to blush.</p><p>“Well write happy for you both,” Wanda announced. “We must have you both over for dinner sometime. Once you’re more, erm, settled into your marriage.”</p><p>“This time next year then?” Agatha joked, and while Victor looked surprised, Wanda laughed.</p><p>“Oh Agatha you are wicked.”</p><p>“Will you be at the wedding?” Rio asked hopefully. She wanted at least some friendly faces there as she became a married (wo)man.</p><p>“We wouldn’t miss it,” Victor assured. “Mr Davis is shutting the shop especially.”</p><p>“He is?”</p><p>Victor nodded. “He was elated by the news, though he wished you weren’t marrying so soon. I think he wanted to throw a celebration in honour of your betrothment.”</p><p>Rio stole a glance over her shoulder to where Evanora was talking enthusiastically with a group of townswomen. “It was a little out of our hands.”</p><p>“Well it’ll certainly be a wonderful day,” Wanda said with a bright grin. “And the start of many years of happiness.”</p><p>“Indeed.” Agatha leaned against Rio, placing her free hand against her chest. “It’ll certainly be a day to remember.”</p><p>Rio gulped and nodded in agreement. The warmth of Agatha against her was sending her body into a frenzy. Fuck, she needed a cold shower, or totally hosing down.</p><p>“We best head on,” Victor said. “After all, you seem very popular today. We look forward to seeing you both on the big day.”</p><p>“Us too,” Agatha replied, before walking Rio on.</p><p>“You put on quite the performance, Miss Harkness,” she commented, and her future wife chuckled, still leaning into her as they walked.</p><p>“I could say the same about you, Captain.”</p><p> </p><p>To her credit, Lilia had worked wonders in the few days before the wedding. She had baked nearly a dozen apple pies for the celebrations, worked it so the bed in the guest room was slightly larger, and made true on her promise in making Rio the most handsome guy in town.</p><p>Her wedding outfit was a naval uniform: a white shirt with a beige waistcoat and pants, finished off with a long navy coat. Each crease had been masterfully pressed and every button polished until glistening. Lilia had offered to help her dress, but Rio declined. Though the uniform was hard to manoeuvre, she needed some time to think. After all, this was meant to be the biggest day of her life.</p><p>As she dressed, Rio played with the ring on the chain around her neck in contemplation. She had kept it well hidden, though she was certain Lilia had seen at least a glimpse of it. It was precious, the only thing she’d ever had of her mother, though it had always been too feminine for her style. She had always liked the idea of giving it to her wife. To give what she had of the family she lost to the family would one day find.</p><p>While it was a marriage of convenience, Rio still considered it a marriage. She planned to look after Agatha and make sure she was comfortable and safe and happy. And so, she took off the necklace and slid the ring from it. Securing the now empty chain back around her neck, she made quick work of buttoning up the uniform and slipped the ring safely in her coat pocket.</p><p>When she was done, she stepped out of her room. Lilia was stood by the fireplace in her Sunday best and offered her a gleaming smile as she entered. “Are you ready to become a married woman?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “As ready as I’ll ever be.”</p><p>“Good.” Lilia picked something up from the mantle. “I found these for you.”</p><p>Rio opened her palm, and Lilia dropped two identical silver rings into her palm. They were plain and crude but still managed to shimmer.</p><p>“I have a ring for Agatha,” Rio told her, at which Lilia raised an eyebrow.</p><p>“You’re giving her yours?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “It was my mother’s.”</p><p>“And you’re sure you want to give it to her?”</p><p>“I am.” Rio put one of the rings back on the mantle and pocketed the other. “But I will take one for myself.”</p><p>“Well then.” Lilia linked arms with her. “Let’s get you wed.”</p><p>The church was filling when she arrived. Most of the people she didn’t know- all townsfolk wanting to seat for the biggest event in town. Rio did spot some familiar faces though- Mr Davis was sat near the front beside a smiley old lady she guessed must have been his wife, while Victor and Wanda sat along side them.</p><p>They all looked to her as she and Lilia headed down to the alter, giving smiles of encouragement. Rio offered them a thankful wave in response.</p><p>“Just stand by the reverend,” Lilia told her as she sat in the front pew. “Agatha won’t be long.”</p><p>Rio nodded and stepped up before the reverend, who smiled at her kindly.</p><p>“Nervous, son?”</p><p>Rio laughed and nodded her head. How could she not be? She was getting fucking married!</p><p>Soon Evanora walked down the aisle, appraising Rio’s appearance before taking her seat in the pew opposite Lilia. She nodded to the reverend, who then raised his arms.</p><p>“All rise.”</p><p>The church echoed with the thunderous sound of the many witnesses standing. Rio looked back to see them all, a little grateful they were, however temporary, at her eye-level. Though the amount of those eyes on her made her feel about two foot tall.</p><p>Then Agatha walked into view, and the world stopped.</p><p>She was dressed in a fine lavender dress that was like something out of a fairy tale, with sections of silk, and detailed embroidery on her chest and skirt, while the locket Rio had given her rested on her chest, the three cameo figures dancing against the rich purple. Her hair was pinned up, revealing every inch of her beautiful face, a lilac flower in her hair that matched those in her small bouquet.</p><p>Rio’s heart hammered hard in her chest. How was this goddess about to become her wife?</p><p>Once they met at the altar, Rio took Agatha’s hand in hers. She offered her a soft smile before looking to the reverend as he began to speak.</p><p>“We are gathered here today to witness the marriage of Captain Rio Vidal to Miss Agatha Harkness, both here and in heaven.”</p><p>Rio heard Agatha laugh quietly and had to bite her lip as not to join her.</p><p>The vows went on, talking about unity and God and the fruitfulness of the colony. After a while, Rio stopped listening and instead focused on the woman beside her.</p><p>Rio wasn’t blind. Agatha was a beautiful woman. Yet seeing her here, dressed like a mythical princess as they were joined in holy matrimony…she swore there had never been a sight more wonderful.</p><p>She also noticed Agatha steal a few glances her own way, but she doubted they were with the same admiration. After all, none of it was real. Just a beautiful illusion.</p><p>She snapped back to attention when they <em>finally</em> got to the vows.</p><p>“Do you, Captain Rio Vidal, take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha with a goofy grin. “I do.”</p><p>“And do you, Agatha Harkness, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head up and smirked. “I do.”</p><p>“You may now exchange rings.”</p><p>Rio fished in her pocket and pulled out the plain ring. She handed it to Agatha. “Ladies first.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head as she slipped the silver band onto Rio’s left ring finger. “With this ring, I join my life with yours.”</p><p>The words took Rio by surprise as her hand acclimatised to its new weight. Reaching back into her pocket, she pulled out her mother’s ring and slid it onto Agatha’s finger, finding it to be the perfect fit. “With this ring, I join my life with yours.”</p><p>She watched Agatha’s eyes widen slightly at the emerald and gold band now resting on her finger, before looking up to Rio questioningly.</p><p>“My mother’s,” she whispered, and she was sure the edges Agatha’s lips raised at her words.</p><p>“I now declare you husband and wife,” the reverend announced. “You may kiss your bride.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, expecting her to lean in, or at least pucker her lips in her usually forward manner. Yet Agatha stared up at her, blue eyes wide and nervous. Taking the lead, she leaned down and placed a soft kiss to the corner of her lips.</p><p>Rio pulled back and marvelled at the light blush on her wife’s cheeks, before they both faced the cheering crowd. Soon the church bells chimed, and it was official. She was married to Agatha Harkness, and for some reason she couldn’t stop smiling.</p>

<p>“Fuck,” Agatha cursed as they entered Lilia’s cottage. “Get this dress off me.”</p><p>They had managed to escape the festivities just before dark, both stating they were eager to finally be alone in each other’s company. The women had giggled, and the men had patted Rio on the back, all wishing their best for the new couple. Yet when they arrived ‘home’ with Lilia in tow and Rio carrying a small bag of Agatha’s belongings, the romantic façade quickly dropped.</p><p>“Is it that bad?” Lilia questioned, at which Agatha nodded adamantly. </p><p>“I can hardly breathe it’s so tight.” </p><p>Rio stood behind her and untied the stings keeping her corset in place. Agatha breathed a sigh of relief, before shrugging out of the rest, until she was stood wearing only an underdress. </p><p>“Thank you, dear husband,” she teased. “Now, if you will excuse me, I wish to retire for the evening.”</p><p>Rio nodded and handed her the battered travel bag. “Make yourself at home. I’ll see you in the morning.”</p><p>“In the morning?” Agatha questioned. “Is this not your room too?”</p><p>“I’m happy to sleep in one of the chairs,” Rio insisted. “You get some rest.”</p><p>Agatha seemed satisfied enough with that answer, but Lilia held up her hands in protest. </p><p>“You cannot sleep in that chair every night, Captain, and you can’t expect her to, Harkness.”</p><p>“It’s Vidal now,” Agatha reminded Lilia, and by extension Rio. “Surely you did not forget that I’m now a married woman.”</p><p>Lilia put her hands on her hips. “Sham marriage or not, I want you to both grow up and accept that you’ve made a vow to each other in front of the entire town. Legally, you are bound. Now I know the law means little to you, Agatha, and I know that you, Rio, have your mind set on leaving. This, however, is a union. A partnership. You need to learn to live with each other, and that begins with sharing a room.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and stomped off into their now shared bedroom, leaving the door open for Rio to follow.</p><p>When she entered, Rio that found her wife had already lit a candle to illuminate the room and had tipped the contents of her bag on the bed, revealing a fresh dress and a hairbrush. Agatha stood by the mirror, pulling the pins out of her hair to free her unruly waves.</p><p>“We need to go to my mother’s tomorrow to collect the rest of my things.” Agatha threw her things aside and climbed onto the bed. “Unless she’s burnt it all by now. Luckily my most prized possession has a protection spell over him. It would take the power of two suns to break through it. Speaking of which, we need to make a rabbit cage.”</p><p>“You want to bring that rabbit here?” Rio asked with a frown.</p><p>Agatha looked at her like she was stupid. “Of course I do.”</p><p>“Right. Okay.” Rio climbed into bed beside her ‘wife’. “But you’re taking care of him.”</p><p>“I have for this long.” Agatha clicked her fingers and the candle went out. “Don’t wake me up early.”</p><p>Rio settled down, ready to sleep off the eventful day, only to quickly find herself shivering. “Agatha, give me my side of the blanket back!”</p><p>“I’m cold.”</p><p>“So am I,” Rio argued. “We need to share.”</p><p>“As my husband…”</p><p>“I’m not your husband here. Give me my side back!”</p><p>Agatha hummed in mock-thought. “No, I don’t think I will.”</p><p>Rio reached over and yanked it all to her side.</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha protested.</p><p>“In these times, women serve their husbands,” Rio reminded her, but Agatha just pulled at the blanket.</p><p>“I’ll serve you my foot up your ass if you don’t give me that blanket right now.”</p><p>“A truce, then?” Rio suggested, and Agatha reluctantly agreed.</p><p>When she woke up the next morning, Rio found herself uncovered and pushed to the edge of the mattress by a lightly snoring Agatha. </p><p>She slipped out of bed and quietly threw on some clothes before finally escaping their little shared space. Lilia was sat and the table eating porridge, and greeted her with an amused smirk.</p><p>“Fun night?”</p><p>“I’m sleeping out here tonight,” Rio vowed, but Lilia shook her head. </p><p>“You’ll hurt your back.”</p><p>“Then I’ll sleep on the floor.”</p><p>Lilia chucked. “Surely she can’t have been that bad…”</p><p>“She stole the whole blanket!”</p><p>“She’s not used to sharing,” Lilia reminded her. “You’ll fall into a routine eventually.”</p><p>Rio strongly doubted that.</p><p>Agatha woke up an hour or so later, ate the rest of the porridge, then demanded Rio take her to collect her things. And so, they walked to town arm in arm, ready to put on another show.</p><p>People smiled and waved to them, a few girls giggling to which Agatha returned teasing smirks. Rio knew what they were all thinking. It was like in college doing the walk of shame through the dorms, everyone staring with the ‘I know you just had sex’ smirk on their faces. She chose to ignore it, partly because it was stupid, and also because the only action they had the night before was fighting over the damn blanket.</p><p>When they made it to the Harkness household, Evanora greeted them at the door. “You’ve married her now, Captain. You can’t return her now.”</p><p>“I’d never wish to,” Rio answered honestly. As much as Agatha had annoyed her the previous night, she was never letting her live with that woman again. “We’ve come for the rest of her things.”</p><p>“Right.” Evanora looked to Agatha. “So, I suppose I don’t have to guess whether or not you’re pure anymore. May I be expecting a grandchild anytime soon?”</p><p>“We tried our hardest,” Agatha answered. “And wish to continue when we get back home. Now, my things.”</p><p>Evanora huffed but nodded. Agatha went inside and Rio went to follow, but Evanora pushed her back. </p><p>“You may have married my daughter, but I will have none of your marital activities under my roof. Especially when I’m certain said activities predate your vows.”</p><p>“Believe what you want,” Rio told her. “It is of no consequence to me.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t take long, emerging with a knitted blanket she had utilised as a sack for her belongings. She held it out for Rio to take. “Carry this, dear husband.”</p><p>Rio forced a smile and took it without argument. Agatha then moved to pick her favoured rabbit out of the enclosure. </p><p>“Well, mother,” she announced. “That is all.”</p><p>Evanora nodded. “Inform me when you know of a grandchild.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply. Instead, she looked to Rio with a fond smile. “Are you ready?”</p><p>Rio nodded, and without another word, they headed away from the Harkness house of horrors.</p><p>Rio looked to the floppy eared animal cradled in her wife’s arms. “What’s his name?”</p><p>“Scratchy,” Agatha answered. “He is a precious little mister.”</p><p>Rio bowed her hat to him. “Good morning, senõr.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her like she was ridiculous, but didn’t argue. “Did you notice I got us a new blanket?”</p><p>“I did,” Rio admitted. “Good thinking.”</p><p>“It’s a compromise,” Agatha noted. “I decided to be the bigger person.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but chuckle. “Thank you.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>That night, Agatha took both blankets, but Rio had enough to snuggle into. A compromises, she supposed.</p><p> </p><p>The rabbit didn’t have a cage. After an argument about how to build it, Rio had decided to leave Agatha to it, and of course she did nothing. And so, they had a rabbit on the loose. </p><p>Lilia didn’t seem to care. After all, the rabbit stayed away from her. He just seemed to like getting under Rio’s feet.</p><p> “Hey!” Rio protested when he tripped her up in the garden. “What the hell, senõr?”</p><p>The rabbit looked at her blankly, before hopping back towards the cottage, where Agatha stood watching her in the doorway. </p><p>Rio shot her a frustrated glare. “Your pet keeps tripping me up!”</p><p>“He’s not my pet.” Agatha crouched down and scooped Scratchy into her arms. “He’s my familiar.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “Your familiar is a rabbit?”</p><p>“Do you have a problem with that?” Agatha questioned challengingly, and Rio held up her hands.</p><p>“Hey, if you want to be the witch with a bunny rabbit hopping along beside you, by all means. Let’s hope he doesn’t fall off your broomstick.”</p><p>“He’s quite nimble on a broom, actually.” Agatha put Scratchy inside before meeting Rio in the middle of the garden. “Lilia tells me you’ve been neglecting your magical studies. You’ve been too busy with that little job of yours.”</p><p>“I thought you wanted money?”</p><p>“Yes, but I’m also looking forward to getting a bit of that power you found to get here. So, since you have two more free day here, I want to give you a little lesson.”</p><p>Rio cursed Mr Davis. He had insisted she take a few days to ‘acclimatize’ after the wedding. The only thing worse than your boss giving you time off to have sex with your new wife was the idea of being taught magic by Agatha Harkness…well, Agatha Vidal now.</p><p>Still, she followed Agatha deep into the woods. Her wife seemed to know the way, and she decided it was best not to question her. Soon, they found themselves in a clearing and Agatha turned to face her.</p><p>“Right, blast something.”</p><p>Rio stared at her wide eyed. “Blast what?”</p><p>“Anything.” Agatha gestured to the space around them. “Just not me.”</p><p>“Because I’ll hurt you?”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “No, because I’m a siphon and I’ll suck you dry.”</p><p>“Wow, y could at least buy me dinner first.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, totally confused.</p><p>“I wouldn’t blast you,” Rio assured. “You’re my wife.”</p><p>“I’d still blast you,” Agatha pointed out, at which Rio shrugged. She figured as much, anyway.</p><p>“So how do I blast something?”</p><p>“Like this.” Agatha whirled round and with a wave of her hand, a blast of purple knocked a low-hanging branch off one of the trees. “Now, you try.”</p><p>Rio looked around and spotted a wild mushroom. She felt bad for uprooting it, but she figured this was important practise. Channelling all her energy, she focused on the innocent fungus and pointed at it.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>She tried again and again, but the result continued to be the same.</p><p>“You can’t just point at it,” Agatha huffed as she stood beside her. “Copy me.”</p><p>Rio copied Agatha’s stance, raising her arms as she did.</p><p>“Now, just move your hands like this.” Agatha flicked her hands forward, slightly but sharply. “No magic this time, though.”</p><p>Rio practised the movement a few times before Agatha nodded in approval.</p><p>“Now try with magic.”</p><p>Summoning all her power, she locked her focus on the mushroom once more and flicked her hands forward. Green energy flew through the air and slammed hard into the earth.</p><p>The force threw them both to the ground as dirt flew up into the air, bits of fungi tossed all around.</p><p>Agatha propped herself up on her elbows. “Well, that’s one way to blow up a mushroom.”</p><p>Rio sat up, horrified by what she had just done. “I’m sorry, I…”</p><p>“No, you did good,” Agatha insisted. “Need to work on managing how much power you’re giving, but still good.”</p><p>They sat there for a while, Rio feeling a little light-headed while Agatha seemed happy to bask in the spots of sun shining through the trees. Eyes closed, head tipped back, a soft smile on her lips. Perhaps it was the sudden over-exhaustion of magic messing with her head, but Rio swore Agatha had never looked so free. So beautiful.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Agatha pointed out without opening her eyes.</p><p>“Can’t I stare at my wife?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “I’ll allow it this once.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I’d better make the most of it then.”</p><p>After a while, Agatha grew bored and announced they should head back to Lilia’s. As she followed, Rio found herself humming. She didn’t know why the song had ended up in her head, perhaps because she missed Alice, or perhaps because she was following a witch through the woods of Salem. Still, it caught Agatha’s attention.</p><p>“What tune is that?”</p><p>“It’s The Ballad of the Witches’ Road,” Rio answered. “It’s a song my friend’s mother wrote. Well, more like adapted. It’s based on an old folk song.”</p><p>“Sing the words to me.”</p><p>“Agatha, I hate singing.”</p><p>“And I hated dancing, but I did it for you.”</p><p>Rio sighed and reluctantly did as her wife requested.</p><p>
<em>I have learned the lesson<br/>Of all that's foul and fair<br/>Our love was forged in fire<br/>Water, earth, and air<br/>The spell is cast, how long it lasts<br/>I cannot divine<br/>The road is there<br/>And so I dare<br/>To risk this heart of mine</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>Rio stopped there, mostly because she couldn’t confidently remember the rest. She looked to Agatha and found the other woman looking back at her curiously.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“You have a lovely voice,” Agatha commented. “Too delicate for a Captain, though.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “You know you can just give a compliment without slapping an insult on the end of it.”</p><p>“I know, but I don’t want you getting too big-headed. After all, you are married to the most beautiful woman in Salem.”</p><p>“And the most humble too.”</p><p>Agatha clicked her tongue. “Come on. Lilia will want us there to help with dinner.”</p><p>“Alright, Harkness.”</p><p>“<em>Vidal</em>,” she corrected. “Now hurry up. I can feel a chill in the air.”</p><p> </p><p>The night was indeed cold, so cold that Rio gripped on to her blanket and didn’t let go no matter how much Agatha tugged. The wind whistled outside, making the wooden cottage creak in the darkness. She tried to sleep, but with the constant sound and Agatha fidgeting behind her, there wasn’t much hope of that happening anytime soon. Still, she tried, and tried, and eventually she could feel herself slipping into slumber…until something hard and cold nudged her calf.</p><p>“Agatha, get your feet away!”</p><p>“This bed is too small,” Agatha huffed. “I can’t get all of me under the blanket otherwise.”</p><p>Admittedly, Rio was having the same problem, only she was trying to live with it. “Where’s Scratchy? Can’t you, I don’t know, get him to warm your feet up.”</p><p>“He’s laid out by the fire,” Agatha answered. “Because he knows there’s no room in this stupid bed!”</p><p>“I’ll swap with him.” Rio went to get up, but Agatha put a hand on her arm to stop her.</p><p>“No, your body is the only thing keeping me warm right now.”</p><p>Rio tried not to read to much into those words. “Then what do you suggest? We snuggle?”</p><p>“Excellent idea.” Agatha yanked Rio closer. “Warm me up, husband.”</p><p>Rolling her eyes, Rio settled back into bed. “Turn away from me.”</p><p>Agatha did as she asked for once, and Rio cautiously lay behind her. She threw an arm over her waist and pressed her front against her back. Admittedly, she quickly felt the benefit. For all her complaints of coldness, Agatha’s body was heavenly warm.</p><p>“Much better.” Agatha wiggled closer to her. “Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p>“Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p> </p><p>When she woke, Rio was alone.</p><p>She guessed from the sunlight that it was early morning, barely after sunrise, yet Agatha was somehow awake.</p><p>Pulling herself out of bed, she changed and headed to the kitchen. Scratchy was eating the remnants of a carrot on the floor while Lilia sat at the table, drinking what looked (and smelled) like a herbal concoction.</p><p>“I made you porridge.” Lilai pointed to the bowl left in the place opposite her, along with a cup of water. Rio sat down and tucked in.</p><p>“Where’s Agatha?” she asked once she had shovelled down three spoonsful of porridge.</p><p>“She’s gone for a walk to the river. Told me she needed to clear her head.” Lilia then eyed her suspiciously. “Did anything happen last night?”</p><p>“Not that I recall,” Rio replied. “We just slept.”</p><p>Lilia pursed her lips, and for a moment Rio was worried the woman was about to hex her.</p><p>“Just be careful,” the older woman warned. “And perhaps after you’ve finished that, you should go check on her.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding. She finished her porridge and swiftly put on her coat, before stalking out of the cottage in the direction of the river.</p><p>She found Agatha sat by the shore, a book in her hands. Her hair was loose, the wild curls catching in the breeze. Rio’s mind took her back to the night before, to the warmth of Agatha’s body pressed against hers. She quickly shoved the thoughts away and walked towards her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio called out, and her wife looked round in surprise.</p><p>“What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Good morning to you too,” Rio teased as she sat down beside her. “What’s brought you out here so early?”</p><p>“I wanted some quiet time to read this properly.” Agatha held up the battered book for emphasis. “I think I’ve found a way for you to become better attuned to your powers.”</p><p>“Oh?” Rio peaked over at the pages. “What do I need to do?”</p><p>“Well, my magic is divine and spiritual, so I take magic from other sources.”</p><p>“Other witches?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “From time to time.”</p><p>“Right, so since I’m a green witch, I take my power from, what? A tree?”</p><p>“Perhaps, but I think that’ll give you very little. The ground, however, is filled with endless possibilities for a witch like you. I’d be jealous if green magic wasn’t so boring.”</p><p>“Wasn’t so boring yesterday when I blew up that mushroom.”</p><p>“First time lucky,” Agatha dismissed. “Soon you’ll be cultivating gardens and talking to animals or whatever it is you green witches do.”</p><p>“You literally talk to Scratchy all the time.”</p><p>“That’s different. He’s my familiar.”</p><p>“Still an animal.”</p><p>“Oh hush and come with me.” Agatha got to her feet and stalked back into the forest. Rio scrambled up and rushed to follow, only to find her a short distance away in yet another clearing.</p><p>Agatha pointed to the forest floor. “Put your hands on the ground.”</p><p>“What…”</p><p>“Just do it.”</p><p>Rio got to her knees and pressed her palms against the moss-covered earth. “Okay, now what?”</p><p>“Close your eyes,” Agatha instructed. “And take.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes, unsure what to do next. Did she have to pull the power up? Did she have to summon it? Did she…</p><p>
<em>Oh.</em>
</p><p>She felt the power rush into her, like adrenaline and ecstasy rolled into one. It reached every corner of her body, the euphoric rush making her hunch her body forward. She needed more. She needed it all.</p><p>Yet before she could take it, two arms wrap around her and suddenly she was yanked back.</p><p>“What the hell?” she questioned as Agatha dropped her to the ground.</p><p>“You were taking too much. You feel like you’re on fire.”</p><p>Rio frowned, unsure what Agatha meant, before she remembered this was Agatha’s thing. She was like a bloodhound for power, and from the way Agatha stared at her, she knew she was radiating a serious amount of magic.</p><p>She got to her feet, trying to shake off the tingling in her hands. “What do I do?”</p><p>“Give me some.”</p><p>“Do I blast you?”</p><p>“No, I won’t be able to control it.” Agatha took her hand. “Bring the magic to your fingers.”</p><p>Rio concentrated and pushed the magic to her fingertips.</p><p>“Now imagine you’re handing it over.”</p><p>She tried to picture it. To imagine pulling the power from her pocket and handing it over to Agatha like spare change. Yet nothing seemed to be happening.</p><p>“You have to do this, Rio,” Agatha said seriously. “If I try to take it, I’ll kill you.”</p><p>“Great encouragement, Agatha.” Rio sucked in a sharp breath. “Okay let me try something else.”</p><p>This time she pictured her magic like a river flowing through her. She pictured the tide reaching her fingertips, before splitting off into a new river. A river of purple that ran through Agatha fiercely.</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet gasp, but she didn’t pull away, both allowing the magic to pass between them. Rio wasn’t sure where she began and Agatha ended, both linked by her powerful offering. A part of her wanted them to stay like that for the rest of time. To be connected completely and unbreakably.</p><p>Yet, after what seemed like forever and no time at all, Agatha let go and staggered back. They were both breathless, and Rio tried to steady herself. “Did I do it right?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, before looking at her curiously. “Your magic. It’s different from other green witches.”</p><p>“It is?” Rio looked at her hands with a frown. “How?”</p><p>“It’s green magic.” Agatha flexed her fingers, like she was savouring a taste. “But there’s a sharpness to it. Unlike anything I’ve known before.”</p><p>“Maybe magic has changed in the future,” Rio suggested. “You know, like evolution.”</p><p>Agatha frowned deeply. “Evolution?”</p><p>It was then Rio remembered that evolution hasn’t been theorized yet, nor did anyone know of the existence of dinosaurs.</p><p>How was she meant to explain this?</p><p>“Evolution is like when creatures change over time to better suit their environment and survive. Animals change, people change. It can take thousands of years, but maybe it’s quicker with magic.”</p><p>Agatha considered it a moment. “Perhaps.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha with concern. “Is it bad?”</p><p>Agatha smirked and shook her head. “Quite the opposite. We might need to share magic more often.”</p><p>Rio guessed she could work with that. Especially if it meant her getting to feel that again. She knew it wasn’t wise to do it often, though. Those kind of rushes often came from playing with fire, and if what happened the day before was anything to go by, magic needed to be carefully controlled.</p><p>“We will continue tomorrow,” Agatha offered. “I’m sure Lilia will want you in the garden today, seeing as you’ll be back with Mr Davis tomorrow.”</p><p>Rio nodded. Their non-existent honeymoon was almost over, and somehow she’d have to create an everyday life out of this ridiculous mess.</p><p>“Can you sing that song again as we walk?” Agatha asked. Rio groaned in protest, but did as she asked anyway.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia stood over her as she tended to the carrot patch. Rio enjoyed working in the garden. While she missed her flowers, she had appreciation for all growing things. Something to do with her green witch energy, she guessed.</p><p>“So you talked?” Lilia asked.</p><p>“We did,” Rio confirmed. “Or, well, we talked generally. We’re fine.”</p><p>“Really? Because she’s sat inside reading all my magic tomes at once,” Lilia noted. “Even Scratchy is confused.”</p><p>“Maybe she did that at her mother’s too.” Rio yanked another carrot out of the ground. “She’s only been here a few days. She’s just getting settled.”</p><p>“I just don’t think-”</p><p>Rio paused her work to look up. Lilia was stood perfectly still, eyes glazed, staring off into space.</p><p>“Lilia?” Rio got to her feet and waved a hand in front of her face. “Lilia?”</p><p>The door to the cottage swung open and Agatha raced out. “What’s going on?”</p><p>“Lilia, she’s having some kind of seizure…”</p><p>“It’s not a seizure,” Agatha corrected. “I can feel the magic. It’s a premonition. A powerful one.”</p><p>“Then what do we-”</p><p>Lilia blinked, her eyes returning to focus.</p><p>“Lilia?” Agatha questioned. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Lilia looked between them and smiled softly. “I’m fine, my dears. Everything is absolutely fine.”</p><p>Agatha gave Rio a sceptical look before putting her arm around Lilia. “Come on. I’ll get you some water.”</p><p>Rio watched them walk inside. The way Agatha ran out told her this wasn’t ordinary, or perhaps it was, and Agatha hadn’t been in close-enough proximity before to sense it.  Either way, it was definitely a cause for concern.</p><p>There was a loud crunch behind her, and she looked around to see Scratchy with his head in her vegetable basket.</p><p>“Ah Senõr!” She quickly lifted him out of the basket. “Why’d you play me like this, man?”</p><p>Scratchy chomped on the remaining mouthful of carrot, unbothered by this thievery. Rio set him down and gave him the carrot he had nibbled.</p><p>“Ask me next time, okay bud?”<br/>The rabbit took the carrot and ran off inside, leaving Rio alone with her plants once again.</p><p>Dinner that evening was quiet. Agatha and Lilia refused to look at each other, and Rio wasn’t getting in the middle of that. Once the nightly chores were complete, they retired early. Scratchy followed Lilia to her room and Rio figured Agatha had told him to, but she decided not to question it.</p><p>In their own room, she and Agatha faced away from each other and changed into their nightshirts before climbing under their respective blankets. It was then Rio finally found the courage to ask the question she’d been holding onto all night.</p><p>“Is Lilia okay?”</p><p>“She’s fine,” Agatha assured. “These things happen with divination witches.”</p><p>“But you seemed concerned?”</p><p>“It was a big spike of magical energy,” she explained. “It startled me.”</p><p>“Does my magic startle you?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha answered. “It…it comforts me.”</p><p>Rio sat up to look at her. “It does?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “You’re a green witch. Not much of a threat.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “No match for your purple?”</p><p>Agatha laughed with her. “Not even close.”</p><p>Rio gave her one last smile before blowing out the candle and settling down in bed. “Goodnight.”</p><p>“Goodnight.”</p><p>Rio lay on her back, staring up at the darkness. The room was so quiet that she feared she was breathing too loud. Beside her, Agatha’s breaths remained light, until they were replaced with a soft voice.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p>“Can you hold me again?”</p><p>Rio held open her arms and Agatha slipped into them, resting her head on her right shoulder. Their arms wrapped around each other, and Rio allowed her eyes to close.</p>

<p>Rio entered the shop with her head held high and her wedding ring secure on her finger. Victor was stood at the desk and whistled when he saw her.</p><p>“I must say, my friend, you are looking very well.” He smirked as she walked towards her. “Married life suits you.”</p><p>“The love of a good woman, I guess,” she replied. The truth was Agatha had insisted all her shirts were washed and pressed, and had cut and braided her hair to make her appear more presentable.</p><p>“My husband will not look unkept,” she had insisted. “It makes me look like a bad wife, and I don’t need my mother lecturing me on it.”</p><p>Rio had rolled her eyes but accepted the pampering without argument.</p><p>“How have things been here?” Rio asked. “No one else causing you grief?”</p><p>Victor shook his head. “Since Ralph is no longer around to cause trouble, the others have stopped caring. Wanda is very relieved.”</p><p>“I can imagine.” Rio imagined if anyone went after Agatha, she would flay them where they stood, and their marriage was but a sham. Wanda probably felt so helpless, unable to protect the one she loved.</p><p>“But all is well, and we must enjoy this time of happiness,” Victor said with a broad smile. “Though are we to expect any little bundles of happiness anytime soon?”</p><p>Rio smiled at her friend’s insinuation but simply shrugged her shoulders. “We must let mother nature take its cause.”</p><p>Victor’s smile remained, but his eyes became sad. “I hope she is kinder to you than she has been to Wanda and I. Though I’m a man of science, I do believe the world around us has an untold force. Perhaps it’s God, or mother nature as you say. I just wished I knew their reasoning for denying us a child.”</p><p>Rio placed a comforting hand on his shoulder. “Have faith. Sometimes the right time comes around.”</p><p>“Well, I wished it would hurry up,” Victor said with a dry chuckle. “I’m no spring chicken.”</p><p>“Hey, I only have a baby face,” Rio insisted, before patting him on the back. “Now, show me those numbers, already.”</p><p>They got to work, Victor talking Rio through the papers while she noted any mistakes she spotted along the way. They were both leaning over a particularly messy ledger when the shop door opened.</p><p>“Ah, our Romeo returns!” Mr Davis announced with a grin as he walked inside. Once he put away his coat and hat, he approached them and held his hand out to Rio. “I’m glad to see you back.”</p><p>Rio smiled and shook his hand. “I’m glad to be back.”</p><p>Mr Davis laughed. “Oh, I doubt that very much. I recall the time after my wedding. Any time away from my beloved was torturous beyond measure. It was a fine day, your wedding. I must say you and Mrs Vidal make quite the striking couple. I knew of Agatha vaguely, but my wife said she is a girl of strong character, and so I’m eager to have you both over for dinner when you are more settled, along with Victor and Wanda, of course.”</p><p>“It would be our honour,” Rio answered. “I’m sure Agatha would love to spend some time away from the cottage. Lilia keeps her company, but it’s not very exciting.”</p><p>“Have you considered where you will live in the long run?” Victor questioned. “I know Mr Jones wishes to sell his home to leave for Boston. It’s very run down, but I’m sure you make it a suitable home. It’s close to Agatha’s mother, too.”</p><p>“I don’t like the idea of Agatha home alone,” Rio half-lied. “And between us, I find her mother quite off-putting.”</p><p>“So my wife says,” Mr Davis said gravely. “Though you will need your own home soon. One where you can raise your family. Leave it with me, dear boy. I will find a solution.”</p><p>Rio smiled awkwardly, before distracting herself with the numbers once more.</p><p>Mr Davis sent her home not long after, insisting that she needed to ‘enjoy this time’ with her ‘wife’. If only he knew the times he believed she was ‘working’ on starting her family, she was actually wandering the woods and learning magic. Still, she had given her a pocket full of coins, and she wasn’t one to question a paid afternoon off.</p><p>As she walked the path to Lilia’s cottage, she spotted Scratchy hopping excitedly towards her.</p><p>“Hey Senõr.” She kneeled down and scooped him up into her arms. “You missed me?”</p><p>The rabbit snuggled into her and Rio smiled. It seemed the little guy was starting to warm up to her after all.</p><p>She carried him back to the cottage, where she found Lilia and Agatha in the garden. The former was hard at work picking apples from the tree while the latter stood back, crunching on one of such fruits while sharing her criticisms.</p><p>“You’re not going quick enough.”</p><p>“Must I remind you, I’m older and shorter than you,” Lilia argued. “And you’ve made no effort to help.”</p><p>Agatha went to argue, but her attention landed on Rio instead. “Ah, my husband is home, and with my familiar no less!”</p><p>She walked over and handed Agatha her rabbit. “Scratchy got out.”</p><p>“He goes where he wants,” Agatha said dismissively. “How was the shop?”</p><p>“Good.” Rio looked over to the tree. “How are there so many apples already?”</p><p>“It’s a magical tree,” Lilian reminded her. “Thanks to you, we will never be without apples again.”</p><p>“Good job too.” Agatha took another hearty bite. “I love apples.”</p><p>“Well how about you help me get these apples picked,” Lilia suggested. “Pull your weight around here for once.”</p><p>Agatha tossed her apple core over her shoulder, before flicking her hand sharply. The tree glowed purple, and all the apples fell to the ground. </p><p>“There,” she said proudly. “All done.”</p><p>“They’ll all be bruised now,” Rio commented, only for Agatha to mimic her voice childishly.</p><p>“They’re resilient little things,” Lilia said as she examined one of the ‘fallen’ apples. “We should be able to sell these at the market.”</p><p>Agatha smirked smugly. “Well, it seems I saved the day after all.”</p><p>They spent the rest of the day filling pails and baskets ready for the market (or rather Rio and Lilia did- Agatha spent her time reading on the porch), before Lilia made a stew for dinner. </p><p>“What are your plans for tomorrow, Rio?” Lilia asked as they ate, and Rio shrugged.</p><p>“I’ll go see Mr Davis, I guess.”</p><p>“We’ll also have another magic lesson,” Agatha insisted. “We can’t forget our mission.”</p><p>“I know, but I thought you wanted money?”</p><p>“Can’t you just cheat at cards again?”</p><p>“No, it would be unfair.”</p><p>“But you did it before?”</p><p>“That was Ralph. He deserved worse.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I suppose you’re right there, but I see no harm in heightening the odds in our favour.”</p><p>Lilia sighed. “Let’s not argue at the dinner table.”</p><p>“We’re not arguing,” Rio and Agatha said at once, making Lilia chuckle.</p><p>“You’re like an old married couple already.”</p><p>They exchanged glances before continuing their meal in silence.</p><p>Lilia declared she wanted an early night, stating Agatha would do the same in order to be ready for market day. Agatha grumbled but did as she was told.  Rio, however, decided to stay up a little longer.</p><p>She sat by the fire, using the light to read from one of Lilia’s many tomes.</p><p>
<em>A green witch is an innate magic wielder whose powers are linked to the natural world. They can use their powers to control plant growth and actions, as well as powers of healing, innate knowledge of herbology and the natural balance, and the ability to manipulate the elements. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Green witches often take power from the earth, helping them deepen their connection and perceptiveness to the natural world. They are not as powerful as Spirit or Protection witches but have a great intuition in matters of the natural order of all things, both in giving life and understanding death.</em>
</p><p>She skimmed through to the bottom, where she found a small notation.</p><p>
<em>For ‘The Green Witch’, turn to page 372</em>
</p><p>“The Green Witch?” Rio frowned and flipped to the bags in question, only to find the page had been ripped out. It wasn’t a surprise. She had found a lot of Lilia’s books had pages missing. Still, it was particularly annoying. </p><p>Deciding to call it a night, she put the book back secured the cottage before heading through to her bedroom. Agatha had left the candle burning, or she had forgotten it, already sprawled across the bed snoozing away.</p><p>Rio quickly changed and slipped into bed beside her, trying not to wake her wife from her slumber. She blew out the candle and settled down against her itchy pillow.</p><p>Agatha grumbled in her sleep, and quickly shuffled into her side, her cheek nuzzling into Rio’s shoulder. She smiled and wrapped an arm around her wife’s sleeping form, before she too fell into a peaceful sleep.</p><p> </p><p>When Rio opened her eyes the next morning, she found herself face to face with Scratchy.</p><p>She flinched, her hands reaching up to balance the rabbit resting on her chest. “Okay, good morning, Senõr.”</p><p>“He’s been like that since sunup,” Agatha said from across the room, already ready for the day in a violet dress that suited her locket perfectly. “He likes you.”</p><p>“Seems like it.” Rio smiled at the cute bunny. “I guess I like him too.”</p><p>“You need to get dressed,” Agatha told her. “Lilia wants your help with the cart.”</p><p>Rio sighed. Of course she did. Sitting up with Scratchy held to her chest, she swung her legs over the edge of the bed and put him down on the floor. After a stretch, she got to her feet and pulled on her pants, before pulling her nightshirt over her head. </p><p>There was a sharp squeak behind her…and it wasn’t from a rabbit.</p><p>Rio looked over her shoulder, and saw Agatha starting back at her, wide eyed and blushing. </p><p>Oh shit. She’s forgotten. 1600s. Modesty. Agatha being uncharacteristically innocent in that regard. </p><p>“Agatha, I’m sorry, I…”</p><p>“No, it’s fine. We’re married. I can see your back.”</p><p>Rio nodded and reached for the material she used to bind her chest. Not too tight, but enough to obscure the obvious curve of her breasts. She wrapped it around her, before securing it under her arm. She picked up a dress shirt and pulled it over her head before adding a waistcoat.</p><p>She turned to show Agatha. “Well?”</p><p>“You need to do your hair.” Agatha moved to sit cross-legged on their bed and patted the space in front of her. “Sit.”</p><p>Rio obeyed and sat on the edge of the bed again. She felt Agatha comb her fingers through her hair before she began the braid.</p><p>“Your hair is very smooth.”</p><p>“And yours is fierce,” Rio admitted. “It looked nice at our wedding, but I like it like this. Wild. Free.”</p><p>“Like me?” Agatha questioned jokingly, but Rio nodded in earnest.</p><p>“It suits you for that reason. I like that part of you. The free-spirit in a sea of rule-followers.”</p><p>“Are you a rule follower, Rio?”</p><p>Rio smirked. “I’ve done things that would make even Lilia faint.”</p><p>“With the ladies you’ve lain with?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio answered awkwardly. “I won’t bore you with the details.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “All done.”</p><p>Rio turned to face her. “Presentable now, ma’am?”</p><p>“Oh, you’re <em>dashing</em>, sir,” Agatha teased right back. “Your wife is a very lucky lady.”</p><p>“You haven’t seen her. She’s an absolute vision.”</p><p>She expected Agatha to tease back again. To push her playfully and tell her to stop messing around. Instead, Agatha just stared at her, biting her lip anxiously.</p><p>Something washed over Rio. A need. A desire.</p><p>The next thing she knew, she was leaning forward. And Agatha leaned in too, her teeth releasing her lip in anticipation. Rio’s heart beat hard, the sound echoing in her ears. Yet in that moment, she decided it was what she wanted.</p><p>She wanted-</p><p>A knock on the door caused them to jump apart, Rio tumbling off the bed in the process.</p><p>“Are you two alive in there?”</p><p>“Very much so,” Agatha answered, her cheeks flushed as she got up from the bed and opened the door. “Rio fell off the bed,” she said as she hurriedly left.</p><p>Lilia stepped into the room and looked down at Rio, hands on her hips. “Are you going to spend all day down there?”</p><p>Rio huffed as she pulled herself to her feet, following the two women to the kitchen for breakfast. It was set to be an interesting day.</p><p>Once she had helped get all of the apples to the market, Rio left Lilia and Agatha to it and went to the shop. To her surprise, Victor and Mr Davis were there waiting for her.</p><p>“My boy!” Mr Davis exclaimed when he saw her. “I have found an excellent solution to both our problems!”</p><p>“You have?” she asked curiously, and both men grinned excitedly back at her.</p><p>“I thought about what you said about staying with Lilia, and it didn’t sit right with me. Your wife could already be in the family way, and you need a bigger home, even if Lilia remained with you to keep your wife’s company.” </p><p>“Right…”</p><p>“Well, I spoke with my darling wife and she made a wonderful suggestion. How do you feel about being one of my tenants?”</p><p>Ah.</p><p>“Mr Davis, I’m flattered, I really am, but I don’t think I can afford…”</p><p>“It won’t cost you a thing in rent,” he assured her. “My only ask is while you are both in the house you fix the place up for me. It still needs some work.”</p><p>“You can move in straight away,” Victor added. “It has been cleared as we’ve had some local boys move the bed from Mr Davis’s guest room over there, and some other people have given some furniture to get you started. You’re very popular, it seems.”</p><p>“That’s very kind, but I don’t know how to fix up a house?”</p><p>“I’ll help,” Victor insisted. “And I’m sure Agatha will enjoy decorating. Wanda is forever finding things for our home.”</p><p>“I don’t know…”</p><p>Mr Davis held out a set of keys. “Just say yes, my boy. We can work out the rest later.”</p><p>Rio considered her options, and realized she couldn’t decline Mr Davis’s hospitality. She needed to keep in his good graces to get money for Agatha and needed Victor close to observe his work on lightning. And so, she reached out and took the keys</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>“No, thank you,” Mr Davis insisted. “I’m hoping you’ll make better work than the previous tenants.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Wait, who were the previous tenants?” </p><p> </p><p>“I AM NOT LIVING IN RALPH BONER’S HOUSE.”</p><p>Most of the market looked their way, but Agatha didn’t seem to care. </p><p>“It’s not his house,” Rio insisted. “It was his father’s and even then, he only lived in it. It belongs to Mr Davis.”</p><p>“Even so!” Agatha picked up an apple and threw it at Rio’s feet. “You should have said no!”</p><p>“How can I say no when someone is offering <em>US </em>a house?!”</p><p>“Easy. Just say fucking no!”</p><p>Lilia stepped between them. “Now you two. You can’t have your first marital spat in the middle of the market. How about you go look at this house and talk there?”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms. “I shall go nowhere near that place!”</p><p>“Agatha, please!” Rio begged. “We can’t refuse Mr Davis’s generosity.”</p><p>Agatha growled in frustration. “I will <em>look</em> at the house, but I will not be made to live in it.”</p><p>Rio decided that was as good as she was going to get.</p><p>Agatha led the way to the house. Rio hadn’t explored further than Salem’s communal spaces and the Harkness house. Yet as she followed her wife through the streets, there was a strange familiarity to it. Like she was seeing somewhere she knew for the first time.</p><p>Then, when they stood before the house that had been granted to them, realization washed over her. </p><p>“Holy shit,” she breathed, not quite believing her eyes. </p><p>“What?” Agatha frowned. “Not good enough for you?”</p><p>“N-no. Agatha…this is where I was staying. Back in my time.”</p><p>“Really?” Agatha frowned. “It’s still standing?</p><p>It did look different, and a little worse for wear, but it was definitely the same house. She recalled Alice saying it had been built before the witch trials, which had happened the year before. But Future Lilia had said…</p><p>Suddenly, it dawned on her. “OH MY GOD I’M CAPTAIN VIDAL!”</p><p>“Had you forgotten?” Agatha sassed.</p><p>“And you’re my wife.”</p><p>“I suppose.”</p><p>“I had a portrait of you on the wall of my room.”</p><p>“I’ve never sat for a portrait,” Agatha dismissed. </p><p>“But you will, and it was on the walk in my room.” She pointed to the necklace. “You were wearing that in it!”</p><p>Agatha reached up to touch her locket. “I suppose it means you did indeed time travel. Lilia suggested you might have fallen through from another reality.”</p><p>“Well at least it means I know how the house is meant to look.” Rio stepped up the porch and unlocked the front door. </p><p>The house was bare on the inside, no paintings, no crystals or candles. Just chipped paint, dust, and cobwebs. She saw Agatha’s face twist in disgust.</p><p>“Did they not think to at least hire a maid?”</p><p>“Mr Davis said it would be a fixer-upper,” Rio explained. “We’ll make it work.”</p><p>In the sitting room, there was a well-worn couch. It wasn’t like the couches of her day, but it did the trick, and Rio quickly laid herself down on it.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“Testing it out,” Rio answered. “Shall we look upstairs?”</p><p>They venture dup the stairs, Rio making note of every lose step as they went. All the rooms were empty, including Alice’s which she took a few moments to study, until they reached the last one. The room Victor, Mr Davis, or whichever boys they had asked to do the manual work had chosen for their marital bed. Though it wasn’t just any room.</p><p>It was <em>her</em> room.</p><p>The bed was in the same place, as was the dresser and wardrobe. Though the walls were bare, and the bathroom was a closet, it was so uncannily familiar.</p><p>“Huh.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“This was my room. When the house was turned into lodgings. I stayed here.”</p><p>Agatha moved over and sat on the edge of the bed. “And now it’s ours.”</p><p>“Yours,” Rio told her. “I’ll just keep some things in here for now, but I’ll sleep on the couch.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Why would you do that?”</p><p>“To give you space,” Rio answered. “You know, the bed at Lilia’s is cramped and it means we can have a bit more privacy.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Is this about what happened this morning?”</p><p>“No,” Rio half-lied. “I just think it’s for the best.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. “If that’s what you wish.”</p><p>“It’s what I…”</p><p>“Then it’s settled then.” Agatha smiled tightly. “We shall move here tomorrow.”</p><p>“Very well,” Rio accepted, and told the curdling feeling in her gut that this was for the best. Truly, it was. She just hoped Agatha would see it too.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Rio woke up with Agatha in her arms, and she suddenly mourned the decision.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had suspected Lilia would be sad to have them gone so soon, but she had arrived with them at their new home with bunches of lavender for each room and came armed with a number of useful cleaning spells up her sleeve.</p><p>“It is a fine house,” the older witch commented as she helped unpack their clothes. “And I’m sure you can both make it the envy of the town.”</p><p>“Hopefully, yes.” Rio put her hat on the dresser, only for Agatha to protest from where she sat on the bed.</p><p>“That is not staying there.”</p><p>“It is for now,” Rio told her. “I’ll sort a hook for it at some point.”</p><p>“I will miss you at the cottage, but I won’t miss your bickering,” Lilia admitted. “I hope you won’t end up killing each other here by yourselves.”</p><p>“We’ll manage,” Agatha answered. “We’ve planned to give each other space.”</p><p>Rio gave her wife an uncertain look, while Lilia chuckled. “Well, you’ll certainly find it here. I’m surprised you haven’t got lost already.”</p><p>“I’m sure Rio would love that,” Agatha commented. “To get away from me for a while.”</p><p>“I enjoy your company,” Rio insisted, but Agatha ignored her.</p><p>“Lilia, would you like to stay for dinner?”</p><p>“Perhaps another time, but I have brought you some bread and stew. Just cook it over the fire and it’ll feed you until morning.”</p><p>The stew was more than enough for them both, and so when Lilia left, Rio heated the stew and prepared the rickety dining table they had been gifted from the townsfolk. When the food was ready, they ate in silence. Rio stole glances Agatha’s way, but the other woman refused to look at her.</p><p>She decided to wait until they had eaten to speak up. “That was good stew.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Lilia is an impressive cook.”</p><p>“She is,” Rio agreed. “Hey, do you want to…”</p><p>“I wish to retire.” Agatah got to her feet. “Goodnight, husband.”</p><p>“Goodnight.” Rio watched her wife go, leaving her alone at the dining table. It was what she “deserved, she guessed. She had pushed Agatha away hours after they had almost kissed and angered the already fiery spirit witch in the process. Still, she believed it was for the best for both of them. Perhaps Agatha would see that soon, but for now she had to deal with the repercussions of her actions.</p><p>She stayed up doing some number work for Mr Davis by the fire, before deciding to call it a night. Readying herself for bed, she lay out on the couch with a blanket thrown over her and a thin pillow under her head.</p><p>Rio lay there for a while, staring up at the ceiling. Sleep evaded her for reasons she didn’t understand. She should sleep better now with her own space and no argumentative spirit witches stealing her blanket. Yet she couldn’t shake the feeling something was missing. That <em>someone</em> was missing.</p><p>Surely, she can’t have gotten so used to sleeping beside Agatha already?</p><p>It seemed, however, she had.</p><p>Rio sighed and hauled herself up, bringing the blanket with her upstairs. She knocked lightly on the bedroom door, and Agatha’s soft voice invited her in.</p><p>Agatha was laid in bed, the candle still illuminating the room and her eyes heavy but awake.</p><p>“Can’t sleep either?” Rio asked, and Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“Are you sleeping here tonight?”</p><p>The slight twang of hopefulness in Agatha’s voice assured Rio’s intensions. “If that’s okay with you?”</p><p>“It is.” Agatha shuffled over, and Rio moved to slip into the bed. They lay side by side, in silence, the candle still burning.</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“We’ll talk in the morning,” Rio assured. “For now, let’s just sleep.”</p><p> She blew out the candle, and opened her arms, Agatha quickly settling into them.</p><p>“Goodnight, love,” Rio whispered into her hair.</p><p>“Goodnight, my love,” Agatha repeated, allowing them both to finally sleep.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Married life was going…surprisingly well.</p><p>Rio always got up first in the morning and did the chores. She’d make some porridge the way Lilia taught her and set the house up ready for the day. Once Agatha finally woke, they’d have breakfast together, before Rio would either head to see Mr Davis or get to work on the house, which so far she had managed to fix a loose windowsill and seal a slight gap in the ceiling that had caused a slight leak in the kitchen. Sure, she was no joiner, but with a bit of advice from helpful neighbours, she got it right. Agatha on the other hand ‘cleaned’, or rather her magic did. One morning, Rio had come home to find the house was like Fantasia, with brooms sweeping themselves across the floor, along with mops and wet rags that made sure the place was spotless.</p><p>Rio should have figured Agatha would find herself a shortcut.</p><p>Some days they went to the market, and of course they saw Lilia as much as they could. Yet all days ended near enough the same: dinner, some reading time in the parlour, before heading up to bed. Which they remained sharing for the time being.</p><p>There were still things about the 17<sup>th</sup> century that she was still struggling to get used to, but Rio had managed to replicate a few of her 21<sup>st</sup> century creature comforts. Most of which were in the form of food.</p><p>“Here you go.” Rio placed the concoction in front of Agatha. “Grilled cheeses!”</p><p>Agatha looked at it cautiously. “It just looks like a mess to me.”</p><p>Rio sat opposite her with her own portion. It wasn’t perfect- the bread was a bit charred and the cheese didn’t melt the same, but when she blew on it and took the first bite, it was still pure heaven.</p><p>“Try it,” she encouraged. “Just pick it up and take a bite.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a sceptical look, but she slowly lifted it to her mouth and took a cautious bite. The groan that immediately came from her lips was fucking sinful, and Rio had to remind herself it was over melted cheese.</p><p>“Fuck, that’s good.” Agatha looked at her in awe. “We must have this every night.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Maybe now and then. I have an idea for hot dogs next.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “You want me to eat a dog?”</p><p>“No, I just…” Rio shook her head. “It doesn’t matter. Just enjoy your taste of the 21<sup>st</sup> century…or I guess 20<sup>th</sup>? I don’t know…the future!”</p><p>Agatah ate her grilled cheese and half of Rio’s, declaring it to be the most delicious thing she had ever eaten, besides a fresh apple of course.</p><p>Rio, however, was feeling rather…uncomfortable. It had been weeks since she last got herself off, and the sound effects Agatha had been making with that grilled cheese had ignited the powder keg of arousal she’d been sat on for far too long.  </p><p>And so, while Agatha was sorting laundry, Rio excused herself upstairs for a ‘lie-down’.</p><p>She undid her buttons of her pants as soon as the bedroom door was shut, just enough to get her hand down them freely enough. Her heart beat fast in anticipation as she moved onto the bed, scooting up her head rested against the pillows.</p><p>Checking the cost was clear, she closed her eyes as her fingers slid downwards, pleasure shooting through her as soon as her fingertips found the sensitive nub between her folds. It wouldn’t take her long. The wait had made her super sensitive, and she quickly conjured up images in her mind to help her through.</p><p>
<em>Cate Blanchett, the bartender at her favourite bar, Margaret Qualley, Idina Menzel,  Agatha, Agatha, Agatha. Oh fuck, Agatha.</em>
</p><p>“What are you doing?”</p><p>Rio yelped and quickly rolled over. She craned her neck to see Agatha starting at her in confusion.</p><p>“I was, erm, sleeping?”</p><p>Agatha put her hands on her hips. “No, you weren’t. You were pleasuring yourself, weren’t you?”</p><p>“No, I was just…” Rio sighed and turned to face her properly. “Okay yes, but in my defence, I haven’t…you know since I got here and its totally natural for me to need some…release.”</p><p>Agatha eyes became curious. “I suppose we never discussed this. Your needs, I mean. Usually, husbands go to the harlots at the dock for such matters, but I guess that’s out of the question in this case.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t anyway,” Rio insisted. “And even if I wanted to, I wouldn’t humiliate you in such a way.”</p><p>Agatha offered her a small smile, before holding out a wax-sealed envelope. “Well, I came up to give you this.”</p><p>Rio took it and saw <em>Captain Vidal </em>was printed on it in swirling penmanship. With a frown, she broke the seal and unfolded it to read the contents within.                                      </p><p>
<em>Captain and Mrs Vidal,</em>
</p><p>
<em>We wish to invite you for an evening of food and good conversation at our home two days hence. No need for formal attire or to bring anything other than yourselves. </em>
</p><p>
<em>We look forward to hosting you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Mr and Mrs Davis</em>
</p><p>“It’s a dinner invitation.” Rio handed the envelope over for her to inspect. “From Mr Davis and his wife.”</p><p>Agatha looked the letter over. “I guess we should go. Show our face in society.”</p><p>“Mr Davis is good company. I’m certain he’ll have invited Victor and Wanda also.”</p><p>“Oh good. I can’t spend my night talking to Sharon Davis.” Agatha tossed the letter at her. “Now do up your trousers and write a response saying we wish to attend. The boy who sent it is still stood on the porch.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because I told him to.” Agatha went to leave the room. “Oh, and next time you need relief, just ask. I am your wife after all.”</p><p>The door slammed shut behind her and Rio stared at it dumbly.</p><p>Her wife’s words echoed in her head as she walked to meet Victor at the tavern. He had requested the day before that she meet him mid-afternoon, and after sending Mr Davis their acceptance of his dinner offer, she had lost track of time fixing a panel on the side of the house. It hadn’t helped that Agatha had been placing sheets on the line, which had distracted her enough to make the job take twice as long.</p><p>And so she rushed into the tavern, relieved to see Victor was still there, sat in the corner with two untouched drinks waiting on the table.</p><p>“Apologies,” she said as she took off her hat and sat down opposite him. “Fixing up that house is taking up more time than I’d like.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Victor assured with a knowing smile. “When I was first married, my time-keeping skills went straight out the window.”</p><p>Rio took a gulp of her ale, another thing she was beginning to get used to. “Did you receive a letter from Mr Davis today?”</p><p>“I did. Wanda and I have already agreed to attend.”</p><p>“As have we. Agatha will be happy. She was wishing Wanda would be there.”</p><p>Victor smiled at that. “I’m glad. I have wished for Wanda to have a friend. She gets on well enough with Sharon, but I’d like the idea of her spending time with Agatha.”</p><p>Rio wanted to laugh. To tell him if he actually knew Agatha, he’d want the complete opposite. Instead, she cut to the chase. “So, what did you want to discuss?”</p><p>“I was talking to a sailor. He said there is a slow-moving storm sweeping up the coast. It hasn’t hit Boston yet, but when it does it won’t be long until we are facing it also.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding. “Right, I’ll get a room ready for Lilia and prepare the cellar just in case…”</p><p>“Yes, yes, and I’ll tell Wanda to join them. We however have the perfect opportunity to take on our little experiment.”</p><p>“Our experiment?”</p><p>“You know, the key and the kite.”</p><p>“Right, yes.” The experiment that shouldn’t exist yet. She quickly came up with an excuse. “I’m unsure how I feel about leaving Agatha alone in a storm.”</p><p>“She’ll be fine,” Victor assured. “If anything, we will be the ones in danger.”</p><p>“That really doesn’t help your case.”</p><p>“Just think about it,” Victor encouraged. “We may have a few days yet, but this could be our chase!”</p><p>“I’ll think about it,” Rio promised, and Victor grinned.</p><p>“Excellent!”</p><p>She offered him a weak smile before taking another gulp of her ale. It seemed she was about to add lightning chaser to her work resume.</p><p> </p><p>The next day Agatha and Lilia had been getting their outfits ready. Agatha was making adjustments to one of her dresses, while Lilia worked on one of Rio’s waistcoats. </p><p>“You know the invite said there was no need to dress up,” Rio said from the armchair. She was working through another ledger for Mr Davis. “Our usual clothes would have been just fine.”</p><p>“I’m not having Sharon Davis going around saying we showed up to her dinner looking unkept,” Agatha insisted.</p><p>“She won’t do that,” Rio assured. “And you could never look unkept, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t argue with that. “At least I have Wanda to keep me company, since you will be preoccupied with the men.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “That’s a sentence I never expected to exist.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled while Lilia looked completely lost. Still, she moved the conversation along. </p><p>“You get on well with Mr Shade, don’t you?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “He’s a nice guy, when he’s not trying to get me struck by lightning.”</p><p>“Lightning?” Agatha questioned. “What, like the lightning that brought you here?”</p><p>“More like general lightning but before I understood this whole magic thing, we got talking about his research. I may have accidentally let slip about a famous experiment in the near-ish future that used a key and a kite to prove lightning conducted electricity. Well, Victor was all over it and he wants me to go out during an approaching storm to try it.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “What? Rio, you can’t do that.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “I can’t?”</p><p>“No, it’s way too dangerous! Tell him your wife said no.”</p><p>“Calm down,” Lilia stepped in. “I must agree with Agatha here, Rio. It’s dangerous and we also don’t know how your magic will react in the storm. It could go haywire and wipe out the whole town!”</p><p>“Or it could send me home?”</p><p>She noticed Agatha purse her lips.</p><p>“Unlikely,” Lilia answered. “The chaos of a storm could send you anywhere. At least here you’re settled. You have a home and a marriage and a job.”</p><p>Rio knew she was right. “Fine, I’ll tell him no, but we need to get to work again finding me a way home. I can’t stay here forever.”</p><p>Agatha picked up her dress again and got to her feet. “I’m going to embroider elsewhere.”</p><p>Rio watched her go with a frown before looking to Lilia in confusion.</p><p>Lilia chuckled and shook her head. “You really have no idea, do you?”</p><p>The older witch worked for a while, before getting up, likely to look for Agatha. Rio looked down at the rows of numbers, pretending to read them while her brain ran over what she had said. It hadn’t been bad. It was just about Victor’s ridiculous (yet scientifically correct) ideas, and how they needed to work out how to get her…</p><p>Oh.</p><p>She was such a fucking idiot.</p><p>Lilia stayed for dinner, making a quick broth out of what they had in the kitchen. It was a tense affair, with Lilia leading the conversation. Rio tried to break the ice, but Agatha would only talk to Lilia, completely ignoring her presence. It was childish, but Agatha was nothing if not a drama queen. It was one of her most entertaining qualities, though now it only made Rio’s heart hurt.</p><p>Once Lilia left, Agatha quickly excused herself and headed up to bed. Rio made sure the house was locked and secure before following her up.</p><p>Like always, they got into their nightwear with their backs turned with a silent agreement that they wouldn’t face the other until they were decent again. Usually there was a sense of excitement in it, something unspoken that made Rio’s throat dry and Agatha’s cheeks redden. This time however it was tense, and when Agatha said she could look round, she witnessed Agatha climb into bed with a face so solemn it filled her with equal sadness.</p><p>“I can sleep on the couch,” Rio offered. “If you’d rather not…”</p><p>“No,” Agatha quickly protested. “I want you to stay.”</p><p>“Alright.” Rio sat on the edge of the bed. “I’m sorry about earlier. I don’t hate it here, but you know…” </p><p>“I know,” Agatha said glumly. “I know you want to go home. I’ve just gotten used to you being around.” </p><p>Rio had to admit she too had found herself settling into their shared life together. It was perhaps something she needed to think about further, but it wasn’t the time. She instead decided to smirk teasingly.</p><p>“You like playing house with me, Harkness?”</p><p>That got a weak smile. “It’s <em>Vidal</em>.”</p><p>“I’ll take that as a yes.”</p><p>“Oh stop your foolishness.” Agatha patted the space beside her. “Get into bed.”</p><p>Rio climbed under the sheets and lay down on her back. “You’re okay with this, right? Me being your husband.”</p><p>“It was my idea,” Agatha reminded her. “We agreed it was the best for both of us.”</p><p>“I know, and I know you don’t want to marry a man, but I know being married to a futuristic lesbian probably wasn’t top of your priority list.”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Agatha reached over and took her hand, their fingers sliding together in a gentle caress. “It seems like it’s where I should be.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand and Agatha took that as an invitation to snuggle into her. Her arms wrapped round her wife and held her close. The 17<sup>th</sup> century wasn’t too bad sometimes. </p><p> </p><p>Agatha spent the next day fussing. She’d done her own hair twice and had attacked Rio’s locks with a brush twice more. Yet by the time they were both dressed and ready, Rio could not deny her wife’s efforts. </p><p>Agatha looked beautiful. She had pinned her hair up as she had on their wedding day and had recycled one of her old dresses with fresh lace and had embroidered it in places with a flower pattern. Rio told herself it was the green witch in her that found it so appealing. </p><p>Agatha also looked her up and down appraisingly. “You look very dashing, Captain Vidal.”</p><p>“And you look gorgeous, Mrs Vidal.” Rio held her arm out to her. “Ready to go?”</p><p>Agatha quickly linked their eyes. “Lead the way, dear husband.”</p><p>The dinner started off peaceful enough. Sharon, Mr Davis’s darling wife, was quite the hostess, and had organised quite the spread, while Mr Davis had brought out his finest wine for them to enjoy between courses.</p><p>Agatha, despite her reservations, was quite the life of the party. She commanded the attention of the room, causing Mrs Davis to stare at her in wonder, Victor to blush, Wanda to smirk, and Mr Davis to laugh so hard he almost choked on a fishbone. When he recovered, he leaned into Rio’s ear.</p><p>“I must say, dear boy. Your wife is quite the dinner guest. I think my wife will want her here often.”</p><p>Rio managed a smile, trying not to think of Agatha’s outrage if she ended up being Mrs Davis’s favourite.</p><p>“So Agatha,” Wanda spoke up. “When can we expect to see a tiny Rio running around?”</p><p>That time it was Rio who almost choked.</p><p>“A bit crass there, my darling,” Victor commented, but Agatha waved him off.</p><p>“We don’t mind. We figure if it happens, it happens. If it doesn’t, we will always have each other.”</p><p>Wanda smiled at that answer. “Victor and I have come to the same conclusion</p><p>“It took two years for us to have a child,” Mrs Davis admitted. “You have plenty of time, you young folk. Enjoy this time together.”</p><p>“Here, here,” Mr Davis agreed. “Now, I will go fetch us a bottle of rum, though if the ladies wish, I can get them more wine.”</p><p>“Oh I never say no to rum,” Agatha responded, making them all laugh once more.</p><p>The women then busied themselves with some local gossip Agatha would no doubt recite to her later, leaving Rio to meet Victor’s gaze with a smile.</p><p>“You alright, my friend?”</p><p>Victor nodded before getting to his feet. “May I speak to you outside for a moment?”</p><p>“Certainly.” Rio stood and followed him out to the room and out onto the porch. The Davis’s house was much bigger than most of the dwellings in town and had a large yard out front. The sun had long-since set, and the moon loomed over them in the cloudless sky. There was something about the stars in this time. No light pollution or greenhouse gasses hiding them from view. Just the pure night sky. It was a marvel she could never get sick of.</p><p>“Can you feel it?” Victor asked. “The stillness in the air. The storm will be here soon. We need to be ready for when it comes. I have acquired the kite and key, but we must be swift. There’s a hill to the west of town. We’ll head straight there by horseback as soon as we see the storm on the horizon.”</p><p>Rio sighed. She hated being a bad friend, but this? This is too much.</p><p>“Victor, I can’t join you in the experiment, and I think you need to consider this more too. The risk much outweighs the reward.”</p><p>Victor’s expression turned to one of hurt. “Rio, this is a scientific discovery! We could change the world!”</p><p>“Or we could stay at home with our wives and make sure they’re safe.”</p><p>Victor stared at her in disbelief. “What happened to the fearless captain who fought pirates and sea monsters?”</p><p>“He finally had something to lose,” Rio answered. “Same as you.”</p><p>Victor puffed out his chest. “I see I read you wrong, Captain. I suppose we better head back inside. The ladies will be waiting for us.”</p><p>“Wait, Victor…”</p><p>“Come on,” he insisted. “Our wives are waiting.”</p><p>Rio watched the man go. Her friend, though perhaps he wasn’t any more.</p><p>With her heart now heavy, she followed him inside.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had assured her she’d done nothing wrong.</p><p>“If he wants to get struck by lightning, let him. He’s a grown man, an educated man. He can make his own choices.”</p><p>Rio knew she was right (however blunt) but that didn’t stop the guilt burning in her chest.</p><p>It wasn’t until the following afternoon that the dark clouds began to loom overhead. Luckily, Lilia had come to get the gossip from the night before and had quickly got to work putting protective charms around the house.</p><p>“My cottage will be fine,” Lilia assured. “There are protective runes everywhere.”</p><p>Rio still didn’t make any chances and closed all the shutters and curtains, and told Agatha to stand well back, which had earned her a much-deserved eye roll.</p><p>Soon the wind began to whistle outside. A harbinger of what was to come.</p><p>“It sounds like it’ll be quite the storm,” Lilia commented. “I expect there will be some devastation.”</p><p>“Oh definitely,” Agatha agreed. “Perhaps even the riverbanks will breech.”</p><p>The wind grew stronger, and Rio’s guilt began to ease. She’d made the right choice. Everyone was safe. Even if Victor never forgave her, she’d accept it just so they could all live another day.</p><p>They were huddled up in the parlour listening to Lilia’s tales from 17<sup>th</sup> century Italy when there was a frantic knock on their front door.</p><p>“Don’t answer it,” Agatha insisted. “We can’t risk the house.”</p><p>“The wards will hold,” Lilia assured, while Rio was already heading for the door.</p><p>She opened and a cloaked figure quickly escaped inside. They removed their hood, revealing damp yet familiar auburn hair.</p><p>“Wanda?” Agatha questioned. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Victor,” Wanda said breathlessly. “He’s gone. I tried to stop him but his mind was set. He’s got a kite and a key, and he’s heading to…”</p><p>Rio was already shrugging on her coat. “When did he leave?”</p><p>“After he left, I ran straight here,” Wanda told her. “But he’s on horseback.”</p><p>“I know where he is,” Rio assured. “I’ll bring him home.”</p><p>“Wait, Rio…” Agatha protested, but she gave her wife a reassuring smile.</p><p>“I’ll be fine,” she promised. “And so will Victor, but I have to go.”</p><p>Agatha looked like she wanted to argue but instead folded her arms. “You better be, otherwise I’ll kill you myself.”</p><p>She gave her wife a weak smile, before running out into the storm.</p><p>Rio rushed across town, the wind battering at her body as she pushed against it. The clouds were above them now, and rain drenched her coat and hair as she ran. Her body, wet and cold, wanted nothing more than to turn back, but she pressed on.</p><p>Soon enough, she saw a flash in the corner of her eye and remembered the old trick she used to do as a kid during a thunderstorm.</p><p>One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.</p><p>Thunder roared all around.</p><p>Two miles away.</p><p>She found Victor’s horse sheltered under some trees as she approached the hill. She greeted it with a pat on the side, before looking upwards. There, on top of the hill, stood Victor. He was struggling to keep hold of the kite, which was already up in the air, battling against the winds.</p><p>Another flash.</p><p>One, two, three, four.</p><p>Less than a mile away.</p><p>Rio rushed up the hill. “Victor!”</p><p>There was no answer. He probably couldn’t hear her over the storm’s mighty roar, and so she moved closer, stopping a safe distance behind him.</p><p>“Victor!”</p><p>This time he turned his head and smiled when he saw her. “Rio! You came!”</p><p>“Yeah, I came to get you home!” Rio shouted over the storm. “Your wife needs you!”</p><p>His smile faltered. “Is she okay?!”</p><p>“Yes, but she wants you home!”</p><p>“I will come home when the experiment is done!” Victor turned away from her. “As soon as I have my results, I’ll be strai-”</p><p>Light filled Rio’s vision, and she felt herself stumble off her feet, her back hitting the wet ground.</p><p>She blinked frantically, trying to regain her light-blotched vision as she sat herself up. Soon she could make out the kite now loose in the sky, caught in the storm that had already begun to rip it apart. The key lay on the ground, smoking against the sodden grass. And Victor lay there, his clothes burnt and body limp.</p><p>“VICTOR!” She rushed to his side. His arms and face were singed, and she could smell the burning of flesh. She checked his pulse. It was faint, but it was there, and he was breathing, however struggled.</p><p>A mind said it wasn’t right to move him, with the old mantra to make someone comfortable until the emergency services arrived. Yet there were no ambulances to call, or hospitals to take whisk him off to. And so she had to do what she could.</p><p>She dragged him down the hill as carefully as she could and whistled for the horse to meet them. Once she had managed to haul him onto the back of the animal, she climbed up herself and sent it onwards.</p><p>She’d never ridden a horse before, let alone one startled by a thunderstorm, yet adrenaline had set in, and she did what she could to get the horse running in the direction of home.</p><p>As soon as she reached the house, Agatha and Wanda ran out to meet them.</p><p>“Victor!” Wanda cried. “Is he…”</p><p>“No,” Rio could grant her only that assurance. “He was struck by lightning.”</p><p>“We need to get him inside,” Agatha insisted, and they worked to pull him from the horse, both wives working to haul him into the house. Rio made sure the horse was sheltered and safe before rushing inside after them.</p><p>She found them all in the parlour. Agatha and Wanda managed to get Victor onto the couch, and Lilia was looking over his injuries with a grave expression.</p><p>“His external wounds are survivable, but who knows what is going on inside. All we can do is wait.”</p><p>“Really?” Wanda’s eyes were wide and panicked. “That’s it?! We just wait and hope?”</p><p>“He’s young,” Lilia offered. “He’s strong.”</p><p>“Don’t!” Wanda snapped with a fierceness that made Rio shiver more than she already was in her drenched clothes. “Don’t you dare! He’s my husband!”</p><p>Agatha stepped forward. “Don’t get like that, Wanda. He was struck by fucking lightning. He’s lucky to not have died instantly.”</p><p>“Agatha…” Rio warned, earning a defensive glare in response.</p><p>“Use your magic,” Wanda demanded. “Use it to heal him.”</p><p>Rio blinked. What did she just say?</p><p>“We don’t have healing magic,” Agatha reminded her, totally unphased by the request. “Unless you have any tricks up your sleeve?!</p><p>“You know I can’t!” Wanda snapped. “You know my magic is bound!”</p><p>“That was your decision!” Agatha bit back. “You know Lilia and I aren’t healers!”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes then flickered to Rio. “What about you? What’s your magic?”</p><p>Rio stared at her in astoundment. “How did you…”</p><p>“Yes, I know you’re a witch,” Wanda huffed. “I knew the moment I met you, and I know you’re powerful. Now I’ll ask again, what kind of witch are you?”</p><p>Rio swallowed sharply. “I’m a green witch.”</p><p>“Can you try?” Wanda asked. “Please?”</p><p>“Wanda, I-I don’t know how…”</p><p>“Then fucking think!” Wanda barked. “I can’t lose him!”</p><p>Rio looked to Lilia, who shrugged her shoulders. “It’s worth a shot.”</p><p>Stealing a glance Agatha’s way, Rio stepped towards Victor and knelt to his side. Unsure what to do, she decided to just follow her instincts. She pressed her hand against his heaving chest and closed her eyes.</p><p>A strange sensation instantly washed over her. She didn’t picture anything, nor did she hear anything. It wasn’t a sense she knew, perhaps one she never knew existed. It was a sense of…knowing. As though somewhere in her mind she knew answers she couldn’t comprehend, yet somehow entirely understood. And in that moment, she knew it wasn’t Victor’s time to die.</p><p>Magic flowed through her hands and soon gasps filled the room. She opened her eyes and saw her hand glowed green against his chest, and her friend’s injuries began to fade away.</p><p>Eventually, Victor opened his eyes and he frowned up at her. “Rio?”</p><p>Before she could respond, Wanda threw herself down before him, hugging him close.</p><p>“My darling, I thought I was going to lose you!”</p><p>He wrapped an arm around her. “I’m sorry, my sweet. I’ll never leave you again.”</p><p>Rio stood and stepped back towards the parlour door, taking in the touching scene as she retreated.</p><p>In the privacy of the hallway, she stared at her hand with a frown. That power…it was beyond anything she had experienced. It wasn’t stolen from the ground or granted by lightning. It came from somewhere deep inside her. Somewhere she never knew existed. Yet she knew it existed now, and it was utterly terrifying.</p><p>She heard a quiet bang and looked round to see Agatha had joined her, shutting the parlour door between them and the others.</p><p>“Agatha.” She stared at her wife as she stalked determinedly towards her. “I swear I have no idea what I just d-”</p><p>Agatha’s hands cupped her cheeks, successfully silencing her. She pulled her face forward, meeting her lips in a searing kiss.</p><p>Rio let out a muffled yelp of surprise, before she found herself sinking into the sensation. Her arms wrapped around her wife and kissed her deeper. Agatha’s hands fell from her face to wrap around her neck, and they were then both lost.</p><p>And in that moment, Rio was certain nothing would be the same again.</p>

<p>Victor had eventually fallen back to sleep, and the witches convened in the dining room. Lilia threw together some bread and fruit, and they sat there as the storm raged on outside.</p><p>“So,” Rio looked to Wanda curiously, “you’re a witch.”</p><p>“As are you.” Wanda looked Rio up and down. “I should have known a man could never be so pretty.”</p><p>“She’s handsome,” Agatha corrected. “The most dashing man in town.”</p><p>Rio tried her hardest not to blush, an impossible feat now she knew how Agatha’s tongue felt in her mouth.</p><p>“But I don’t understand,” Rio pressed. “You had powers and now you don’t?”</p><p>“I still have powers,” Wanda explained. “In fact, I could give Agatha a run for her money.”<br/>Agatha laughed sharply. “You wish.”</p><p>“Then what happened?” Rio asked. “Why quit?”</p><p>“I met Victor,” Wanda admitted with a soft smile. “I fell in love with the most amazing yet ordinary man in the world. I could have spent my life hiding that side of myself, but I decided I wanted a true life with him. So I bound my powers.”</p><p>“Can you undo it?”</p><p>“Not easily, but I’ll never want to. I’m happier now than I ever was with my magic.”</p><p>Rio smiled. That was very sweet.</p><p>“So, now I’ve explained myself.” Wanda pointed between Agatha and Rio. “What’s all this about?”</p><p>They explained it the best they could. Well, Rio did while Agatha added comments every so often. When they were done, Wanda started laughing.</p><p>“So your mother has no idea you married a woman?”</p><p>“Not a clue,” Agatha smirked. “She thinks Rio married me because she laid with me out of wedlock.”</p><p>Wanda laughed loudly. “That’s hilarious!”</p><p>“So I pissed off my mother, got my own house, and I don’t have to spend my life married to a piggish bore of a man.” Agatha smiled triumphantly. “And Scratchy has his own room too.”</p><p>“For now,” Rio stepped in. “He’s going outside when I build him that hutch.”</p><p>Agatha waved her off. “He loves it here.”</p><p>Wanda looked to Rio in contemplation. “So you’re just staying here until you can find a way home?”</p><p>“If I can.” Rio stole a glance at Agatha. “I’m working with the assumption that I can’t. Building a life that hopefully Agatha can continue after I’m gone.”</p><p>“So you two are just going to stay married?”</p><p>“Yes,” both Rio and Agatha answered at once, making both Wanda and Lilia chuckle.</p><p>“Wow,” Wanda commented. “You two are quite convincing.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat and looked down at her lap. “Victor will be fine. I don’t understand it but my powers…I don’t know. I just knew it wasn’t his time.”</p><p>“How could you possibly know that?” Wanda questioned. “That’s impossible.”</p><p>“Clearly not,” Agatha answered for her. “And she is a green witch. Life is a part of nature.”</p><p>Rio gave her wife a thankful smile and watched as her lips curled into their own faint smile.</p><p>“Well I am very grateful for whatever power it is.” Wanda placed a hand over her heart. “I owe you a huge debt.”</p><p>“You owe me nothing,” Rio assured. “I care about him too. Victor has been a good friend to me.”</p><p>“And you to him,” Wanda insisted. “I’d be jealous if I wasn’t certain your interest landed, shall we say, <em>elsewhere.</em>”</p><p>Rio bowed her head shyly, well aware of Agatha’s gaze burning into her.</p><p>She knew a conversation needed to be had. One that might be difficult and would change their marriage regardless of the outcome. Still, it was a conversation they had to have.</p><p>And so, once the storm cleared and Lilia went to help Wanda get Victor home, Rio asked Agatha to join her in the parlour. They sat side by side on the couch Victor had vacated, and Rio fought against herself to look her wife in the eye.</p><p>“Why did you kiss me?”</p><p>“Am I not allowed?” Agatha questioned defensively. “I am your wife.”</p><p>“Agatha, please.”</p><p>“Please what?”</p><p>“Answer me honestly,” Rio pleaded. “Why did you kiss me?”</p><p>Agatha averted her gaze. “Because I wanted to.”</p><p>“In the moment, or…”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Not just in the moment. I’ve wanted to kiss you since we danced in the marketplace.”</p><p>Rio stared at her in disbelief. “You have?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “It’s not that shocking.”</p><p>“No, I just didn’t expect…” Rio stopped herself and stared again. “I mean I just…I want to understand. Please don’t get mad, but did you want to kiss me or Captain Vidal?” </p><p>Agatha frowned. “You are Captain Vidal?”</p><p>“Yes, I know, but is that who you want? Because sure I’m partial to a little genderfuckery, but I-I’m not…”</p><p>Agatha huffed. “Will you please speak plainly.”</p><p>“I’m not a man,” Rio stated. “I can be him for the rest of the town, but I can’t be him for you.”</p><p>“I don’t want you to be.”</p><p>“Agatha, I don’t think you understand…”</p><p>“I’m not stupid, Rio,” Agatha snapped. “I’m aware you’re a woman.”</p><p>“Yes, but…”</p><p>“No buts! Yes, you’re a woman. Yes, I wanted to kiss you.”</p><p>The penny dropped.</p><p>“Oh.” Rio’s eyes widened. “<em>Oh.”</em></p><p>“You sound like an owl.”</p><p>Rio laughed nervously. “Sorry, I just have so many questions. Like, is this new for you? Wanting to kiss a woman, I mean.” </p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands. “No, it’s not. I’ve always had what my mother calls <em>sinful afflictions</em>.”</p><p>“So, she knows?”</p><p>“Not really. It’s a long story.”</p><p>Rio reached over and took her hand. “I’m listening.”</p><p>Agatha looked to her wearily, before she began. “I guess there has always been this feeling that I was not like everyone else. I didn’t dream of marriage and families, and the thought of being stuck with a man for the rest of my life made me angry. Then when I got older, I befriended a reverends daughter. Mother encouraged the friendship, and we’d spent an entire summer together. Soon seeing her was all I cared about. When I was with her, I felt on top of the world, and being away from her was pure torture. After a while, I began to notice things about her. Her hair, her eyes, her smile. In my eyes, she was perfect.”</p><p>Rio pushed down the uncomfortable feeling in her chest. “What happened?”</p><p>“We were sat in the woods one day, talking and laughing, and she looked so beautiful that I couldn’t help it. I-I kissed her, and it was the best moment of my life, before quickly turning into the worst. She pushed me away. Called me a degenerate, and said I was possessed by the devil. I made up a lie. I dismissed her and said I wanted to practise for a husband. She went back to town and told everyone. My mother punished me severely, but the townsfolk thankfully found humour in it. A silly girl wanting to know what a kiss felt like. A girl ready for a husband, right when I realised I never would be.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand. “Oh Agatha.”</p><p>“As you can imagine, I had some interest after that. I received numerous proposals, and most I made a point of off-putting, and all but Ralph Bohner got the message. Luckily my mother didn’t hate me that much. She said if he asked again, she’d turn him into a toad. Still, as I watched the girls my age marry and have children, I resigned myself to being a lonely spinster. After all, the only person I had ever had any romantic affection for had called me a ‘degenerate’. So I focused on other things, like getting the hell away from this town and out of my mother’s grasp. Then, you came crashing into my life.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I wouldn’t say crashing…”</p><p>“You crashed in like a crazed animal and have turned my life upside down,” Agatha remarked. “But I will admit, I noticed how beautiful you were almost instantly, both in your strange future attire and, yes, even as Captain Vidal. Though I thought those girls foolish, I understood why they had set their attention on you, even if their stares and giggles were painful to watch.”</p><p>Rio laughed again as Agatha continued.</p><p>“Still, you infuriated me with your unusual ways, and you almost made my heart burst during that card game. Yet that night in the marketplace when you asked me to dance, things changed. I-I hadn’t felt anything like that for a long time. Anything so…bright and hopeful. I-I wanted to kiss you, to dance until the music stopped, perhaps even let you whisk me back to Lilia’s cottage and…anyway, of course my other came and ruined the moment. As she led me away, I swore that when we met the following day, I’d kiss you right there by the river.”</p><p>“Then why didn’t you?” Rio questioned. “Why push me away instead?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “When I got home and listened to my mother’s spiteful words that I realised how dangerous that was. These feelings had brought me nothing but hurt, and I didn’t want that to happen again. So, yes, I <em>tried</em> to push you away, but of course it didn’t work.”</p><p>“I wasn’t letting you go that easily,” Rio teased, watching as Agatha fought a smile as she continued.</p><p>“Then in we were engaged and then we were married and sharing a bed. The temptation to just kiss you was too much to bear, especially after I knew you had, erm, lain with women before.”</p><p>“Then why didn’t you?”</p><p>“I was scared you wouldn’t want me,” Agatha admitted. “And I-I was scared of losing you. I still am, because any day you could disappear, and I didn’t want to get my heart broken. Yet when you ran out into that storm, I thought I’d lose you. It filled me with terror but also regret. I wished I’d been braver and just kissed you every time I wanted to. At least then I’d have more than whatever fantasies existed in my head. When you came back not only alive but with a power that brought a man back from the brink of death, well my resolve broke. It was brass, I know, but when have I ever been subtle?”</p><p>Rio looked down at their joined hands and rubbed her thumb against her wife’s knuckles. “You kissed me.”</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>“So what now?”</p><p>“Now I want you to tell me how you feel,” Agatha prompted. “Fair is fair.”</p><p>“My feelings?” Rio looked back up at her wife, deep brown meeting piercing blue. “Can I show you instead?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened a little, but she nodded.</p><p>Giving no time to second guess, Rio leaned in and lightly pressed her lips against Agatha’s. Gentle, at first, like the touch of feather, before bringing her free hand up to tenderly cup her cheek and she moved in with determination.</p><p>Agatha’s hand let go of hers as she moved to grip her shoulder, keeping her close as the kiss descended deeper and deeper. Rio placed a hand on her waist, her brain a total fog. She had kissed people before, or rather made out as that was pretty much what they were doing, but it had never been like this.</p><p>So hot.</p><p>So passionate.</p><p>So fucking good.</p><p>When they eventually pulled apart, breathless and dazed, their foreheads pressed together and a lazy smile pulled on Rio’s lips.</p><p>“I’ve wanted to do that for a while too.”</p><p>“I can tell,” Agatha said as she struggled to catch her breath. “So we can do it again?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “No objections here.”</p><p> </p><p>Two days passed and three things became very apparent to Rio in that time.</p><p>The first was that 17th century houses were pretty flimsy. The town was in a rough way, and everyone was pulling together to help repair the damage. Unfortunately, her mother-in-law’s house was unscathed, but there was always next time.</p><p>The second was that whatever she had done to save Victor had put a spring in her friend’s step. He said he felt better than he had in years and was certainly more energized than usual. Rio chose not to question it. She was just happy he was alright.</p><p>And the third and most important observation was that Agatha Harkness liked kissing.</p><p>A lot.</p><p>At any opportunity, Agatha’s lips were against her. Sometimes in cute little pecks, but more often than not devouring her hungrily until they were making out like horny teenagers. This had happened everywhere: in the kitchen, on the couch, in their bed, and currently against the hallway wall.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio managed to say between kisses. “I need to go.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha whined. “I want you to stay.”</p><p>“You know I want to, but I need to go to work. And you said you wanted to go to Lilia’s.”</p><p>“I did,” Agatha admitted, and Rio took the opportunity to wiggle out of her grasp.</p><p>“Shall I meet you there later? We could have a magic lesson in the woods.”</p><p>“Only if I get a taste of that power of yours?” Agatha said with a devious smile. “Perhaps through a kiss?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio teased. “Think you can handle me, Harkness?”</p><p>“It’s Vidal, to you.” Agatha straightened her waistcoat and neck scarf. “And I think you’ll be surprised what I can handle, dear husband.”</p><p>“Oh really?”</p><p>“I may not have your experience, but I’m a <em>very</em> quick learner.”</p><p>Rio swallowed. “Good to know.”</p><p>Agatha picked up her hat and placed it carefully on her head. “Have fun at work.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio kissed her one last time before heading for the door. “Goodbye, my love.”</p><p>“Goodbye, my love,” Agatha repeated, and Rio couldn’t suppress the smile on her lips as she stepped out of their home.</p><p>Since admitting their feelings, Rio had been the happiest she’d been since she arrived there, perhaps even before. It wasn’t even about the kissing and the cuddling either, though she was certainly enjoying that. It was the way Agatha looked at her. Sure, there were still the looks of ridicule and exasperation, but now her eyes gleamed with something new. With an adoration she was no longer scared of hiding.</p><p>Rio didn’t want to imagine what she looked like- most likely a lovestruck fool. She guessed that was accurate.</p><p>When she made it to the shop, Victor was stood behind the counter. He greeted her with a large grin. “Rio, you’re here!”</p><p>“I am.” Rio took off her hat and placed it on the counter. “I thought Mr Davis gave you the week to recover.”</p><p>“I don’t need the week,” he insisted. “I’m fine.</p><p><em>Yes, because I saved you with my fucking magic. </em>“Well make sure you take it steady. Getting struck by lightning isn’t something you just bounce back from.”</p><p>“It was the key that got struck,” Victor corrected. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Rio sighed and shook her head as she pulled a roll of papers from her coat pocket. “Here’s the receipts Mr Davis wanted me to look over. I made the appropriate corrections and notations.”</p><p>“Fantastic. He left your money here.” Victor pulled a small sack of coins from the desk draw and tossed them over, Rio catching it with ease. “I’m surprised you managed to get them done so quickly. It seems you may have had some distractions.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Victor chuckled. “You neck.”</p><p>“My…” Her fingers moved to brush the patch of skin just under her jaw, where Agatha’s lips had travelled downwards the night before and…fuck. “Oh it’s not- I just…”</p><p>Victor held up his hands. “You don’t have to explain anything to me. I’m a married man, after all.”</p><p>Rio bowed her head to hide her blush. “Is it noticeable?”</p><p>“Not much,” Victor assured. “Just keep you collar high.”</p><p>Rio made sure to do just that as she walked through town, only loosening it when she reached the path to the woods, and saw Lilia’s cottage coming into view. There, he found her wife helping their friend in the garden, collecting the apples from the still fruitful apple tree.</p><p>When she noticed her presence, Agatha dropped the basket and rushed to meet her, practically throwing herself into her arms. “Finally, you’re here!”</p><p>Rio chuckled and held her close. “I see I was missed.”</p><p>“That would be an understatement,” Lilia commented. “She’s talked about you continuously ever since she arrived.”</p><p>“I have not,” Agatha snapped as she pulled away. “And am I not allowed to be happy to see my husband?”</p><p>Lilia rolled her eyes. “Come on you two. These apples won’t pick themselves.”</p><p>Once all the apples were picked, the couple excused themselves for their magic lesson, promising Lilia they would return for dinner. As they walked away from the cottage, Rio reached out and took Agatha’s hand.</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Holding your hand,” Rio answered. “Is that okay?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer and instead squeezed her hand as she led them onwards to yet another small clearing. Rio flexed her free hand in anticipation. She had to admit, she had been feeling a little fatigued since saving Victor and was in need of a good energy boost. Yet she also knew she had to learn something too. Whatever this green witch power was, she needed to learn to control it properly, and that started with the basics.</p><p>“What spell shall we practise today, dear wife of mine?” she teased, and Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“How about a fixing spell?”</p><p>“Sure?”</p><p>Agatha found a pinecone and broke it against a tree. She held the broken pieces out in her hand. “So, all you need to do is summon your magic and use your fingers to help weave it back together. Try and picture its shape and features. Your magic will do the rest.”</p><p>Rio concentrated hard as she tried to put the pieces back together. On her first attempt she’d put the scales in the wrong way, then she put the top upside down, then all the scales pointed up instead of out. Each time, Agatha clicked her fingers and the pinecone returned to its broken state, ready to go again.</p><p>“You know what a pinecone looks like,” Agatha prompted. “Imagine it in your head.”</p><p>“This is hard,” Rio grumbled, and her wife rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Apologies. I didn’t realise you don’t know what a pinecone looks like.”</p><p>“I do,” Rio insisted. “It’s just got lots of little pieces.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about that. Picture it whole and the magic will do the rest.”</p><p>Rio focused herself. It was just a pinecone. She had seen it on Agatha’s hand fully intact. Surely it had been retained somewhere in her internal hard drive. Mostly, her eyes had fixed on Agatha, something that was become more and more unavoidable. Still, she tried to shift her perception of the memory, zoning away from her admittedly captivating wife to the object that had been whole in her hand.</p><p>Her magic began to move the pieces again, and this time everything seemed to slot into place. Rio smiled once the puzzle was complete. “There.”</p><p>“Very good.” Agatha tossed the pinecone over her shoulder. “You would have probably gotten there quicker if you had more power. I’ve felt you’ve been running low since the storm. It has replenished some, but you definitely need a boost.”</p><p>Rio nodded as she dropped to her knees. “Will you stop me when I take too much?”</p><p>“As long as you promise to share.”</p><p>“What’s mine is yours, my love.”</p><p>Rio pressed her palms against the ground and began to take in the energy. It was just as exhilarating as before, and she took and took, not letting go until Agatha’s arms wrapped around her waist and pulled her back.</p><p>“That’s enough.”</p><p>Rio turned herself around in her arms and smirked. “Ready for me?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head at her antics. “Just shut up and kiss me.”</p><p>Rio granted her wish without question, and their lips once again met. She took Agatha’s hands, gently pushing her backwards until her back met the ground. Their kiss never broke, not even when she began to pass the magic between her palms, giving Agatha what she craved. In that moment, Rio would have given her it all. Given over her heart and soul, though perhaps they were already hers. Perhaps they always had been.</p><p>When Agatha had her fill, she pulled her hands away and broke the kiss. As they caught their breaths, she reached up and took Rio’s hat from her head. “I hate this stupid thing.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>“I like seeing your hair, especially when it’s down.”</p><p>“Well, it was longer before you and Lilia insisted on cutting it shorter, even though I’ve seen men with hair down to their butts.”</p><p>“That’s an exaggeration,” Agatha dismissed. “So, husband, shall we head back?”</p><p>Rio rolled off her. “Let’s just stay here for a minute.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer but snuggled into Rio’s side all the same.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“What are we now?”</p><p>Rio frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Well, we’re married, and now we’re kissing and embracing.”</p><p>“Yes, we’ve been doing that a lot.”</p><p>“Don’t joke,” Agatha huffed. “I’m serious. Are we in a true marriage now?”</p><p>Rio looked over to her. “Do you want to be?”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha admitted. “But I’m also enjoying this part. The newness. It seems far from marriage, even though that is what we are.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding. “Well, we’re only married in the eyes of the town. To us, we can be whatever we want.”</p><p>“So we’re courting?”</p><p>“I guess?” Rio took her hand. “I’d ask you to be my girlfriend if you weren’t already my wife.”</p><p>“A girlfriend?”</p><p>“Yeah, like in a relationship. Still working things out so not ready to make the commitment of marriage, but ready to kiss and date, and well eventually…”</p><p>“Consummate the relationship,” Agatha finished, her voice a little shaken. “Alright, I agree to that. Though don’t forget, I am still your wife.”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio assured. “I wouldn’t have it any other way.”</p><p> </p><p>They had dinner at Lilia’s before heading back home as the sun began to set. Agatha saw to Scratchy as Rio made sure the house was locked up. Protective wards or not, she wanted to make sure her wife was totally safe.</p><p>Soon, Scratchy was settled, the house was secure, and they were both stood in their candlelit bedroom. Like always, they turned away from each other to change into their nightgowns, something that had once been filled with tension now rushed with desperation.</p><p>Once they were both ready, they settled into bed side by side. Yet instead of snuggling into her like she always had, Agatha boldly swung her leg over Rio’s waist as she moved to straddle her.</p><p>Rio smirked. “Didn’t you get your fill in the forest?”         </p><p>“Not even close.” Agatha gripped the front of Rio’s nightshirt and pulled her to sit up until they were face to face. “I don’t think I’ll ever have enough.”</p><p>Their lips clashed together in a heated kiss. One so desperate and raw that it made Rio’s toes curl. Agatha seemed equally affected as her hair slid through her hair and her hips began to lightly grinded against her. She had done that a few times, whenever they found themselves in this exact position. Rio was unsure whether Agatha was aware of she was doing it, or if it was her body’s instinct to find some kind of friction.</p><p>“I love your hair loose,” Agatha said between kisses. “You look so beautiful.”</p><p>“And you’re a fucking goddess.” Rio kissed her hard then. Harder than she had dared so far.</p><p>The moan Agatha spilled into her mouth told her she’d made the right move.</p><p>“I love kissing you so much,” Agatha admitted as she shifted in her lap.</p><p>“Me too,” Rio agreed. “Fuck, you’re amazing.”</p><p>Agatha manoeuvred her legs, moving backwards as she did. The next thing Rio knew, her wife was straddling her thigh.</p><p>“Agatha, what are you…”</p><p>She felt a warm, wet press against her, and Rio’s eyebrows shot up as it slid over skin. This couldn’t be happening. Surely she wouldn’t be-</p><p>“<em>Oh.</em>” Agatha gripped her shoulders. “<em>Oh fuck</em>.”</p><p>Yep, she was definitely riding her thigh.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“It feels…fuck. I’ve never…oh Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s hands moved to her hips, helping to guide her movements. Agatha’s moans grew louder.</p><p>“Oh! Oh Rio! Please don’t stop. Please don’t stop.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio promised. “Take what you need.”</p><p>Agatha’s his rode her hard and fast, her moans echoing in Rio’s ears. Feeling bold, she pressed her thigh up slightly, offering her some more friction.</p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha tipped her head back, breaking this kiss yet granting Rio some new landscape to explore. She latched her lips pulse point, sucking at the delicate skin. A hand quickly cupped the back of her head, holding her in place as if she would ever want to leave that perfect spot.</p><p>Agatha’s moans grew louder and the press against Rio’s thigh grew wetter by the minute. It took everything in her not to push Agatha back and shove her face against her soaked centre. She just knew she’d taste amazing.</p><p>Instead, she allowed one of her hands to let go of Agatha's waist and instead use it to cup her breast. They groaned in unison, Agatha at the touch and Rio at the way the pebbled nipple grazed against her palm.</p><p>“Oh Rio,” Agatha gasped. “Feels so good.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said against her neck while her hand kneaded her breast. “Keep going, my love. Keep going.”</p><p>Agatha rode her thigh frantically, rocking over and over as her moans echoed through the house. Rio followed her lead, sucking and caressing at the same rhythm, basking in the sounds of pleasure as her wife rode on and on. Moving and moving, until…</p><p>“Oh <em>fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfu…”</em></p><p>A cry of pleasure escaped Agatha’s mouth as a torrent of wetness rushed against Rio’s thigh.</p><p>The thigh her wife had just fucked herself on.</p><p>Agatha fell forward against her, her hips still grinding down as her body shook with the aftershocks. Rio wrapped her arms around her, placing a delicate kiss to her forehead.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” she assured as she leaned backwards until she was once against resting flat on the bed. Agatha curled onto her chest, burying her face against her shoulder. Rio placed another kiss to the top of her head. “I’ve got you, my love.”</p>

<p>Rio loved to watch Agatha sleep. She always looked so beautiful. So peaceful. Like she knew she was finally safe. Cared for. Loved.</p><p>It was in moments like this that Rio wondered how the hell she had gotten in this situation. How she’d ended up married to the most gorgeous woman in all of time was beyond her, but she wasn’t going to question it. Not in that moment, when everything was perfect.</p><p>She then heard thumping outside her door and sighed.</p><p>Scratchy was awake.</p><p>Carefully sliding out of bed, she picked up her pants as she crept across the room and slowly opened the door, slipping out of it before gently pushing it shut. Sure enough, Scratchy was sat there waiting, looking up at her with those big bunny eyes.</p><p>“Good morning, Senõr,” she greeted him quietly as she slid on her pants. “Shall we head downstairs?”</p><p>Dressed enough to roam through the house, she set to work as she always did, preparing breakfast. Yet on Saturdays, as that day was, she had an added component to her routine.</p><p>Lilia had given her the elixir, saying it would stop her period. Usually she didn’t take birth control, but getting your period in public with no sanitary products when you’re supposed to be a cis man was not a risk anyone was willing to take. She had started taking it every Saturday morning, and each time, it was worse than the last.</p><p>The taste was both sour and bitter, so harsh it made her gag with each of the two prescribed spoonful’s. Yet, like every Saturday, she did it and tried to keep herself spitting it out long enough to build the nerve to swallow it. This time, she did it almost instantly, her body desperate to get the taste away from her tongue and ate a basil stem to cover the taste. At least that was done for another week.</p><p>She was about to start preparing breakfast when she heard footsteps coming down the stairs. Rio looked round and smiled as Agatha appeared in the kitchen doorway.</p><p>“Morning.”</p><p>“Good morning,” Agatha purred, before her eyes landed on the bottled elixir. “Lilia got you taking that?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“I prefer my own brew. That I only take monthly. I’ll brew you some in time for your next dose.”</p><p>Rio stirred the porridge again. “This should be done soon.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha walked across the room and latched on to her arm. “Can I get my morning kiss?”</p><p>“Of course.” Rio leaned down and placed a quick kiss against her lips. “Now, would you be every so helpful and set up the table for us, my darling?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and patted her arm. “Anything for my handsome husband.”</p><p>They worked in perfect synchrony, Agatha setting the table while Rio finished off the porridge and served it two bowls. They both settled at the kitchen table, enjoying their meal in comfortable silence. Eventually it was Agatha who decided to break it.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“How do two women consummate a marriage?”</p><p>Rio almost spat her porridge all over the table. She swallowed it down harshly. “W-what do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean you don’t have a…”</p><p>“Penis?”</p><p>“Yes, and I was wondering how it worked since you can’t just…stick it in me.”</p><p>“Okay, for starters, sex comes in many forms. Yes, the most traditional form is penetration, but it can look differently to others.”</p><p>“So what we did last night was us having sex?”</p><p>“I’d say you dry humped my leg.”</p><p>“Is that sex?”</p><p>Rio sighed. This was hard to explain, mostly because she didn’t know the answer. “Did you think it was sex?”</p><p>Agatha frowned in thought before shaking her head. “I did enjoy it though.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I could tell.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, her cheeks now bright red. “What are your plans for today, dear husband?”</p><p>“I thought I’d go see Lilia,” Rio answered. “Help her tend to the garden.”</p><p>“You and your green witch tendencies,” Agatha teased lightly. “I’ve agreed to meet Wanda, but perhaps I will meet you at Lilia’s. We could go to the river. I haven’t been there for a while.”</p><p>“Sure.” Rio had to admit that last part worried her. The two times she had gone to the river with Agatha had led to some heavy conversations. Was there a reason Agatha wanted to go there?</p><p>“And Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I’ll be thinking about your thigh all day.”</p><p>Rio cleared her own throat and sat up straight in her chair, trying to ignore the tingling between her legs. “That’s, erm, good to know.”</p><p> </p><p>She was still thinking about Agatha’s comment as she knelt in Lilia’s garden, tending to a lavender plant. In fact, she was thinking about the whole situation. From their conversation that morning to the memory of her wife riding her thigh to completion the night before. It all played over and over in her mind, along with the possibilities of what was to come.</p><p>Her thoughts would remain to herself though. Agatha called the shots. When she was ready, Rio would do whatever she wished. If she never wished for Rio to touch her again, she would accept it. Agatha Harkness had her under her spell, and she never wanted to escape.</p><p>A smash behind her made her snap out of her trance. She looked over to see Lilia staring down at a broken pot and seemed to be cursing in Sicilian. Rio pulled herself up and walked towards her. “You okay?”</p><p>“I dropped my favourite pot,” Lilai said sadly. “But I can fix it.”</p><p>“Here, let me.” Rio waved her hand over the broken shards, and the pieces came back together once more. “There you go.”</p><p>“Agatha teach you that?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio knelt down and picked up the pot. “Here you go.”</p><p>Lilia took it carefully and examined it closely. “You’re very good at this. I can’t even tell it was ever broken.”</p><p>“I had a good teacher,” Rio answered, and Lilia chuckled.</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure she…”</p><p>Lilia’s face became blank, her eyes glazed as she stared off into nothingness. The pot dropped from her hands, but Rio managed to catch it.</p><p>“Lilia?” She set the pot down and waved her hand in front of the woman’s face. “Lilia, are you okay?”</p><p>Lilia didn’t react. Just remained there, suspended in time, and Rio had no choice but to stand there helplessly.</p><p>Then, Lilia’s eyes moved, locking on to Rio.</p><p>Rio took a step back. “Lilia?”</p><p>Lilia dropped to her knees, and Rio rushed to support her.</p><p>“Lilia, are you okay?”</p><p>“The cards.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Rio, get me the cards!”</p><p>Rio ran into the house and searched wherever she could. Eventually, she found a pack- an aged deck covered in pictures.</p><p> She raced back out and gave the cards to Lilia, who quickly shuffled them, before laying down three cards.</p><p>She turned over the first. “The High Priestess. Hidden knowledge.”</p><p>“Lilia, what-”</p><p>Lilia turned over the next card. “Three of Swords. Heartbreak.”</p><p>“But what are you…”</p><p>The next card flipped over, and Rio’s heart dropped. There was no mistaking what that one meant.</p><p>“Death.” Lilia looked up to meet her gaze. “Where all roads lead.”</p><p>Before Rio could question any of it, Lilia blinked rapidly and glanced around her surroundings.</p><p>“Did I disappear again?”</p><p>“A little,” Rio said a nervous laugh. “You okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine.” Lilia looked down at the cards on the ground in front of her. “Why are these here?”</p><p>“You did a reading.”</p><p>“A reading?” Lilia frowned.</p><p>“Yes, with the cards.”</p><p>Lilia waved her off dismissively. “You can’t read fortunes with playing cards.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, the garden gate flew open and Agatha rushed over to them.</p><p>“I could feel the magic from the edge of town,” she said breathlessly as she slowed to meet them. “What the hell happened?”</p><p>“I slipped away again,” Lilia answered. “It’s all alright.”</p><p>“No, it isn’t,” Agatha insisted before looking to Rio. “Was it bad?”</p><p>Rio pressed her lips shut and nodded.</p><p>“See? Two against one.”</p><p>Lilia waved her off as she got to her feet. “I’m fine. See? Unhurt.”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms. “These premonitions are getting out of hand. They’re happening all the time and they seem to be getting worse. We need to find out what’s happening here.”</p><p>“Nothing is happening,” Lilia insisted. “I’m fine, but I do feel in need of a rest. You two go enjoy your day. I’m sure you have <em>plenty</em> to do.”</p><p>Agatha gave Rio a look, who held up her hands. “I swear I haven’t told her anything.”</p><p>Lilia just laughed as she headed into the cottage. “Remember to shut the gate behind you.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and shook her head. “Fine, on her head be it.”</p><p>“Wait, we’re actually going to leave her?” Rio asked as she followed her girlfriend out of the garden.</p><p>Agatha swung open the garden gate again and stormed out into the forest. “If she doesn’t want our help, why should we care?”</p><p>By the time they reached the river, Agatha was in a full-blown rant.</p><p>“And she doesn’t think of the consequences. What if she does this in the middle of town? What if she gets hurt and we end up finding her? She is so selfish sometimes, and stupidly stubborn.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “That sounds oddly familiar.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “At least I would admit when I needed help.”</p><p>“Would you?”</p><p>“Yes…perhaps...okay probably not but I’m not the one with the problem. She is!”</p><p>Agatha marched to the shore, looking out at the river with her hands on her hips. Rio walked up behind her and wrapped her arms around her waist, her head coming to rest of her wife’s shoulder.</p><p>“I know you’re worried. I am too.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back into her. “What happened?”</p><p>“She was fine then she just went blank. I thought it was like before, but then she dropped to the ground and asked for the cards.”</p><p>“What for?”</p><p>“To read a fortune it seemed.”</p><p>“A fortune? But they’re just playing cards?”</p><p>“In my time, Tarot is a way of telling fortunes. I don’t think it has been used that way yet. Lilia, the other one in my time, said she could read them.”</p><p>“But how would our Lilia know how to read them?”</p><p>“I don’t know,” Rio answered. “Unless that wasn’t our Lilia.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I travelled through time physically. What if she is mentally.”</p><p>“But you said your Lilia was a descendant of our Lilia.”</p><p>“Maybe it travels through bloodline, or they have some kind of shared connection? Who knows.”</p><p>“I’ll do some more reading,” Agatha concluded. “I won’t be letting this lie.”</p><p>And Rio knew she meant it.</p><p>They watched the water go by, Agatha’s arms covering her own as she held her close. Rio loved the way she felt in her arms. So warm and soft. She wanted to stay wrapped up in her forever.</p><p>“I don’t know how you do it,” Agatha mused. “I could be carrying the weight of the world and all I have to do is fall into your arms and it just slips off my shoulders.”</p><p>Rio hugged her tighter. “I’ll always look after you.”</p><p>“You will?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I did mean my wedding vows, you know.”</p><p>Agatha hummed. “I want to uphold them too.”</p><p>“You are,” Rio assured. “I’m very happy.”</p><p>“There is one think I’m not doing, though. Or rather we aren’t doing.”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio frowned. “Agatha, if there’s something I’m doing wrong…”</p><p>“No, Rio, it’s not like that I…” Agatha pulled out of her arms and turned to face her. “I want to consummate our marriage. Properly. I want to feel like I did last night every night, and I want to make you feel that way too. I want to see you properly without all these ridiculous captain clothes. I want us to be together in that way. If you want that too?”</p><p>Rio swallowed harshly. She never dreamed when she first met Agatha, or even when the married, that they would end up here. That this question would be asked. Yet there was no other answer she could give.</p><p>“Yes.” She reached out and cupped her wife’s cheek. “Agatha, I want that more than anything.”</p><p>Agatha smiled in relief, and Rio couldn’t help but kiss her. A kiss full of passion and desire, which her wife returned in equal force. If they were home, she would have swept Agatha up right there and then, carrying her to their bed so she could finally worship her. Yet instead, she pulled back and tucked a strand of Agatha’s wild hair behind her ear.</p><p>“Come on. I want to get started on dinner.”</p><p>“What are you cooking me?”</p><p>“I’m going to use that meat you got us from the market to make cheeseburgers.”</p><p>“Cheese what?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha ate two cheeseburgers and stole the rest of Rio’s second. They had attempted to make French fries, but they just ended up a mess, so Rio mashed them, and Agatha ate most of that too.</p><p>“That was amazing!” Agatha declared, to which Rio shrugged.</p><p>“Not exactly McDonalds, or Burger King, oh or Five Guys, or an In-And-Out.” Rio practically salivated at the thought. She missed being able to go into any greasy hole in the wall and get a greasy-ass burger with greasy-ass chips that she could dunk in a lumpy-ass milkshake. She wished she could replicate that for Agatha, but it seemed her wife was pleased enough.</p><p>“Aren’t I lucky to have such a considerate husband.” Agatha reached across the table to take her hand. “Who cooks for me and cares for me. I just wish I could take care of you too.”</p><p>Rio bowed her head at that last part, unable to suppress her smile. “I like taking care of you. In <em>every</em> way.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, and Rio could see her eyes darken with desire. Yet it was too soon. They had to clean the kitchen, and relax a little to settle their stomachs, before venturing upstairs. Into their bedroom. Into unchartered territory.</p><p>And so they got to work, soon the kitchen was spotless (well as spotless as it could be without the modern marvel of cleaning products) and they were cuddled up in the parlour, Rio looking over more numbers for Mr Davis, while Agatha read one of her spellbooks.</p><p>“It says here that it’s impossible to see beyond your own timeline,” Agatha answered. “Perhaps Lilia is still alive when this Taggart thing took off.”</p><p>“Tarot,” Rio corrected her. “And perhaps, but things are only impossible because they haven’t happened yet. Lilia could just be super powerful.”</p><p>“No, she’s not,” Agatha answered confidently. “Even her spikes in power don’t match half of what radiates you when doing small spells.”</p><p>“Maybe I’m special too,” Rio countered, and Agatha nudged her playfully.</p><p>“This is serious, Rio.”</p><p>“I know, but it’s late and I’ve had enough of looking at numbers.”</p><p>Agatha instantly sat up. “You want to go to bed?”</p><p>Rio’s heart began to thump in her chest. “Yes, if you wish to join me?”</p><p>Her wife didn’t answer. Instead, she hid her spellbook away and raced up the stairs, leaving her to lock up the house. Rio took her time. She didn’t want to rush this. It wasn’t just their first time. It was Agatha’s. It needed to be natural, genuine, meaningful. She needed to be all those things for her and more.</p><p>Eventually she made her way upstairs, finding their bedroom door open, lit by the warm glow of candlelight. When she reached the doorway, she found her wife still dressed, looking out of the window through a crack in the curtains. Rio stepped into the room, her foot pressing on a creaky floorboard. Agatha looked round and offered her a smile.</p><p>“I was wondering where you’d run off to.”</p><p>“Just making sure everything is how it should be,” Rio assured as she moved towards her wife, kicking off her shoes as she went. “I want no unpleasant interruptions.”</p><p>“Me neither.” Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck. “I just want you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. Her hands found Agatha’s hips and she met her in a searing kiss. A kiss that had no restraint, no fear. A kiss that screamed as loud as it could. A kiss that showed her desire.</p><p>Agatha was the first to pull away, and her hands quickly went to the buttons of Rio’s waistcoat. “I want to see you.”</p><p>Rio stepped back and undid the buttons herself, tossing off the waistcoat before moving to her pants. She quickly pulled them down her legs, well aware of the way Agatha watched them fall to her ankles until only her shirt remained. Once again, she kicked them away.</p><p>“Want me to carry on?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Please.”</p><p>Sucking in a breath, Rio undid as many buttons as she needed before pulling the shirt off over her head, leaving her in nothing more than her chest bindings. She heard Agatha’s breath hitch as she looked down between her legs.</p><p>“I usually keep it a bit more tamed,” Rio admitted, but Agatha didn’t seem to care.</p><p>“I think it’s beautiful. I think you’re beautiful. Please, let me see the rest of you.”</p><p>Rio made quick work of her bindings, and soon her chest was also exposed.</p><p>She stood there, bare before her wife, ready for her judgement.</p><p>Agatha moved to her, her hand reaching out to trace the edge of her breast. “Perfection.”</p><p>“Still good?” Rio asked and Agatha nodded, her eyes not leaving Rio’s chest.</p><p>“I’m so good.”</p><p>Rio chuckled as she reached back to pull her hair free from its short braid. She shook it out, allowing it to brush against her neck, teasing the tops of her shoulders. “How about now?”</p><p>Agatha looked up and giggled. “Your hair is such a mess.”</p><p>“Going to be even more messy soon,” Rio warned, no, promised. “But right now, I’m feeling a little overdressed.”</p><p>She expected Agatha to be modest, to be shy and reserved about revealing her body for the first time. Instead, her wife all put tore the dress from her body as her boots flew across the room. Rio watched in awe as the fabrics fell away, until Agatha was in nothing but her undershirt. She eyed with a with a smirk before she pulled it over her head and that too joined the pile on the floor.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but stare.</p><p>Agatha was a fucking vision.</p><p>She knew that already, but to see her here. Her curves, her hips, her chest. Rio wanted to touch all of her. To kiss every inch of her skin. To be fully absorbed in her until it was indistinguishable who was who. She just needed to feel her more than she needed air in her lungs.</p><p>“Well?” Agatha tilted her head. “Now what do I do?”</p><p>Rio hesitated. She totally forgot she was taking the lead this time. “Lay on the bed for me, my love. Get comfortable.”</p><p>Agatha climbed onto the bed, setting her head against one of the pillows. Rio quickly went and grabbed the other one.</p><p>“Lift your hips for me.”</p><p>Agatha did as she asked and Rio quickly slipped it under her, before prompting her wife to relax once more. She climbed over her wife, slipping between her leg until their bodies were flush together.</p><p>“If you want me to stop, tell me,” Rio insisted. “Tonight is all about you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in understanding and Rio placed a quick kiss to her lips, before sliding down the bed. She sucked one of her nipples into her mouth, her tongue playing with it a moment before she did the same with the other.</p><p>Agatha arched into the touch, her hand resting on the back of Rio head. “I feel like I’m on fire.”</p><p>Rip pulled back to smirk at her. “I’m only just getting started my love.”</p><p>She placed a kiss to Agatha stomach before sliding lower, until her head was resting between her thighs. She took a moment to admire the sight of her like this. The way her chest heaved with anticipation, how her eyes fixed on her, how wet and ready she was. She had never witnessed such a wonderous sight.</p><p>Rio placed a kiss to either side, before leaning in and giving her clit a gentle lick.</p><p>Agatha jolted. “Woah, that’s…”</p><p>Rio did it again and again, adding firmness with each stroke, before she sucked it into her mouth.</p><p>Agatha moaned and pushed her hips up, her hands lacing in Rio’s hair. “Please, keep going.”</p><p>She continued to focus on that bundle of nerves for a few moments, until she felt wetness drip onto her chin. She couldn’t resist. She had to taste her.</p><p>Unlatching from her clit, she ran her tongue through her folds, gathering as much of her juices as she could.</p><p>Agatha gasped. “Fuck!”</p><p>Rio’s head shot up. “Are you okay?”</p><p>“Please do it again. Please, Rio. I can’t-”</p><p>Rio got right to work, exploring every inch of her with her tongue. It was amazing. The taste, the feel, the sound. She could spend the rest of her life right there, and Agatha didn’t seem to mind. After a well-timed lick, her legs wrapped around her head in a vice grip, but Rio didn’t care. If getting crushed by Agatha’s thighs was her way to go, she’d count it an honourable death.</p><p>Soon Agatha’s hips got a life on their own, thrusting up against her at a rapid speed, before suddenly locking up.</p><p>A shaky cry left Agatha’s lips as Rio found renewed wetness on her tongue. She didn’t stop though. She licked her through her orgasm into the after low, Agatha’s thighs keeping her in place.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio,” Agatha groaned. “I want to do that again.”</p><p>Rio pushed Agatha’s thighs apart so she could look up at her. “Can I go inside?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Inside?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “We don’t have to if you don’t…”</p><p>“Do it,” Agatha insisted. “I-I want to know how it feels.”</p><p>“Alright, but if you want me to stop…”</p><p>“Yes, yes, I’ll tell you. Now <em>please</em> get inside me.”</p><p>Who was she to deny her?</p><p>Rio gathered as much wetness as she could on her fingers, before cautiously pushing the first digit in.</p><p>Agatha’s gasp came out as more of a squeak as her walls gripped on tight, and Rio shifted upwards until she was lying beside her, her finger still resting inside her. She kissed her wife’s shoulder.</p><p>“Just relax. Let your body adjust.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in understanding and soon Rio felt the grip on her finger relax into squeezing pulses. She pulled her finger out halfway before pushing back in again, hearing her wife’s breath catch in her throat. She did it again, and again, until Agatha began to moan.</p><p>“You ready for more?” she asked, and Agatha nodded, her eyes squeezed shut as her mouth remained open, releasing the sounds of her pleasure.</p><p>On the next inward thrust, Rio added the second finger and Agatha screamed.</p><p>“Oh fuck!”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>She nodded without hesitation. “It’s so good.”</p><p>Rio smiled to herself, placing kisses to her neck as she picked up her rhythm again, basking in the feeling of being inside her while listening to her chorus of moans. She looked over her wife’s body. The way it blushed and arched and thrust to meet her fingers. Agatha was a goddess, there was no doubt, and Rio was lucky enough to worship her.</p><p>“More,” Agatha insisted. “I need more.”</p><p>Rio knew what to do. She slid a third finger in on the next thrust and watched Agatha throw her head back, a mighty moan echoing through the room. “Yes, oh fuck. Yes! Yes!”</p><p>A few more thrusts and Agatha fell apart, covering her hand in her release.</p><p>Rio slowed her movements as her orgasm began to fade, waiting until she was done before slowing pulling her fingers out. She sucked them in her mouth, savouring the taste once more before snuggling against her wife’s spent form.</p><p>“Are you alright?”</p><p>Agatha nodded as she snuggled against her. “I never knew it would feel like that.”</p><p>“You did so well,” Rio praised. “I know first times can be daunting.”</p><p>“It was at first, but you made me feel so safe that I forgot about all that. I just wanted you.”</p><p>“You have me.” Rio kissed her cheek and held her close. “I promise you have me forever.”</p>

<p>The next morning, Rio woke up to Agatha tracing around her breast. It was early, the first sight of sun beginning to peep through the windows. Usually, her wife wouldn’t wake up until it was full in the sky, but it seemed today was an exception.</p><p>“You’re up early,” she commented groggily, while Agatha replied with a wakeful laugh.</p><p>“Why sleep when I have you lying bare right next to me.”</p><p>Rio laughed this time. “Guessing yo enjoyed last night then?”</p><p>“Enjoyed? Oh, my love, it was life changing.” Agatha sat up, her own breasts now on full display. “But I…I want to know how to make you feel like that.”</p><p>“You will,” Rio assured. “But I want you to be comfortable in your own body first.”</p><p>Agatha reached down and palmed her breast. “Can’t we do both?”</p><p>Both? Well, Rio may be able to work with that.</p><p>Taking the lead once more, Rio moved their bodies into position, before pressing her core against Agatha’s. She moaned at the touch. Her wife was already so wet she had to bite her lip to stop herself from saying something totally pathetic.</p><p>Agatha, however, didn’t stay quiet. “Fuck! You feel amazing, my love.”</p><p>Rio smiled and began to rock her hips, relishing at the sight of her wife tipping her head back as pleasure burned between them. She started slow and careful, easing them into it. Or at least attempting to. Until Agatha started thrusting her hips up desperately.</p><p>“Rio, I need more,” she gasped. “Please.”</p><p>Rio decided it was time to let loose. She grasped Agatha’s leg and hooked it over her shoulder, changing the angle. The stimulation was instant and soon her own hips became frantic.</p><p>“Agatha, you feel so good. I-I can’t hold on much longer.”</p><p>“Keep going,” Agatha begged, her breasts bouncing with the movements. “Please, Rio. Don’t stop.”</p><p>Rio doubled down, determined to make her wife come. “You look so fucking hot, my love. I wish I had my strap. You’d look so hot spread around me. I’d be so deep inside you, making you come over and over.”</p><p>Agatha’s back arched up as a cry left her lips, and Rio shuddered soon after, collapsing on top of her wife as they basked in their shared pleasure.</p><p>“Fuck, that was good,” Rio said, her face buried in the valley of her wife’s breasts. “You’re amazing.”</p><p>“Better than the others?” Agatha asked as her hands weaved into Rio’s hair.</p><p>“Yes. No question.”</p><p>“Good.” Rio could hear the smugness in her wife’s voice, but she didn’t care. Not after she’d made her come like that.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Hmm?”</p><p>“What’s a strap?”</p><p>Rio looked up at her. “A strap?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “You said you wished you had it.”</p><p>Her hazed mind then recalled what she’d said, and she blushed deeply. “It’s like a toy. You use a harness to strap it around your waist so you can thrust it inside someone. Like I do with my fingers but, well, bigger.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Like a cock?”</p><p>“I guess. You can get different types. Some realistic, some really not. Different sizes and stuff.”</p><p>“I’d have liked to try that,” Agatha pondered. “Could we make one?”</p><p>“I could make a harness. I’m not sure about the…you know.”</p><p>“The shaft?”</p><p>Rio bit her lip and nodded.</p><p>“I have heard of such things,” Agatha admitted. “Made of glass or porcelain, sometimes wood.”</p><p>Rio winced at the thought of the last one. “Maybe not wood, but I did have a glass…shaft. I never used it like that though. It could break.”</p><p>“We could enchant it not to,” Agatha urged. “Please?”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, there was a determined thump outside their bedroom door. She groaned and detangled herself from her wife.</p><p>“Senõr is awake.”</p><p>“You need to get your own familiar,” Agatha grumbled. “You keep stealing mine.”</p><p>“He likes me,” Rio argued. “Like you do.”</p><p>“I more than like you, Vidal,” Agatha stated, before rolling over to settle amongst the sheets once more.</p><p>Rio paused on her way to the door, looking at her wife with wide eyes before slowly leaving the room. She greeted Scratchy with a smile and headed downstairs with him hot on her heels, Agatha’s words ringing over and over in her head.</p><p> </p><p>It was Sunday, so they threw on their best wears and made their way down to the church. ‘For appearances’, Agatha insisted, though Rio quickly began to suspect it was to show off. Show off her ring, her home, and most of all, her husband.</p><p>They walked into church arm in arm, while Agatha chatted with a woman who Rio gathered was a childhood acquaintance.</p><p>“We are working on the house. My husband is very handy, having helped repair ship damage and such. My role, besides housework, is to make the home. Once everything is done, we will go to Boston so I can pick out some fine furnishings.”</p><p>Rio smirked to herself. It was all bullshit. They weren’t going to Boston, they hadn’t talked about decorating, and Agatha did no housework that couldn’t be achieved through magic. Still, she would let her wife have her moment to prove all the town wrong. That she was indeed a model wife, with the perfect husband. The ideal. The one to envy and aspire to. She deserved this. She deserved happiness.</p><p>“You both seem very much in love,” Agatha’s friend commented. “And when can we expect children from you two?”</p><p>Rio bit the inside of her cheek.</p><p>“We’re definitely trying,” Agatha said, and both women giggled. “I guess it shall happen when it happens. What will be will be, after all.”</p><p>Once her friend left to join her family, Agatha hugged Rio’s arm. “I can’t wait to get home. I think we’ll need to spend the rest of the week in bed.”</p><p>“I wish we could, my love, but I have work.”</p><p>“Say you’ve come down with a sickness.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “What, hornyitus?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What’s that?”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Never mind.”</p><p>They spotted Victor and Wanda and moved to sit in the pew beside them.</p><p>“Good morning,” Rio greeted them as she allowed Agatha to sit beside her friend.</p><p>“Good morning,” Wanda replied. “Where’s Lilia this morning?”</p><p>“Ill,” Agatha quickly answered. “With her, erm, headaches.”</p><p>Wanda seemed to understand, while Victor frowned with concern.</p><p>“Should we fetch her a doctor?”</p><p>“No, she gets them often,” Wanda assured him. “I’m sure she’ll be fine.”</p><p>Agatha then looked over her shoulder and clicked her tongue. “My mother is here.”</p><p>Rio stole a glance and saw Evanora taking a seat with another older woman. She looked back to Agatha and held her hand. “It’s fine. She’s not in charge of you anymore.”</p><p>“Technically, Rio is,” Wanda teased, and Agatha laughed sharply.</p><p>“Please, that’ll never happen.”</p><p>Rio knew she was right.</p><p>The service was long and boring, and Rio spent most of it either looking at her wife or daydreaming about her. Mostly about their conversation that morning. How hard was it to find a dildo in the 17<sup>th</sup> century? She was sure there must be some around, but if not, how could she make one? Would her powers help? She wasn’t sure, and she certainly wasn’t asking Lilia about it.</p><p>Still, Agatha was interested in trying it, and Rio wanted her to be able to explore her sexuality after pushing it down for so long. And like any good husband, she wanted her wife to be happy. So, she guessed she’d have to find a way.</p><p>After the services, they walked out arm in arm, Wanda and Agatha chatting away so neither she nor Victor could get a word in edgeways. They had barely made it out of the church when a familiar figure approached them.</p><p>“Agatha, Captain,” Evanora addressed them stiffly. “May I have a word?”</p><p>They gave apologetic looks to their friends before stepping to one side.</p><p>Agatha folded her arms. “What do you want, mother?”</p><p>Rio remained close to Agatha, bracing for whatever her mother-in-law had to say.</p><p>“You have been in that new home of yours for some time and I am yet to receive an invitation for dinner.”</p><p>“You said you didn’t want to hear from us until we were with child,” Agatha argued. “So we’re respecting that.”</p><p>Evanora shot her a glare. “Don’t be clever, young lady. So, when will you be expecting me?”</p><p>Rio wanted to say never. That she would never go near their home or their little bubble of happiness and should go wallow in her self-inflicted isolation. But she kept quiet. This was Agatha’s decision.</p><p>“How about tomorrow?” Agatha suggested. “Unless you have plans?”</p><p>“Tomorrow will suffice,” Evanora accepted. “I will see you both then.”</p><p>Rio watched her mother-in-law walk off before looking to Agatha. “Are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha sighed and nodded. “It was inevitable. I don’t care, though. Like you said, I’m not hers anymore. I’m yours.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “More like I’m yours.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Yes, that sounds about right. Now, come on. Let’s head home.”</p><p>They barely made it in the house before Agatha was on her. Rio managed to manoeuvre her into the living room on onto the couch, before a heated make out session led to her fingering her wife under her dress, followed by eating her out until she was screaming in ecstasy.</p><p>“Fuck!” Agatha lay back, her chest heaving in her Sunday dress. “I’m so glad I married you.”</p><p>Rio crawled up to lay on top of her. “You are?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and kissed her sweetly. “I don’t think I’ve ever been this happy.”</p><p>“Me neither,” Rio admitted. “Even if I can’t charge my phone.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What’s a phone?”</p><p>“It’s a device. It helps me contact people. I have mine with me, but you need electricity to power it, so I can’t keep it on all the time.”</p><p>“Electricity,” Agatha mused. “Like what Victor is obsessed with?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “In like, I don’t know, half a century, electricity will take a huge step forward. By my time, everything is powered by it. No need for candles and fireplaces or flame ovens, unless you like that kind of thing.”</p><p>“And can I see this phone?”</p><p>Rio went upstairs and retrieved the device from where she had hidden it at the back of a draw. She turned it on as she was coming down the stairs. The battery was at 61%, with no signal or internet registered.</p><p>She sat down next to Agatha on the couch and opened up her camera roll. “This is me and my friend, Alice.”</p><p>Agatha blinked before leaning towards the screen. “A tiny portrait?”</p><p>“No, it’s a photograph.” Rio slid along to show a photo of the inside of her flower shop. “They’re made up of pixels.”</p><p>“Pixies?”</p><p>“No, pixels. Like little dots of light.”</p><p>“Like a mosaic?”</p><p>“Yes, but with really tiny tiles of light.”</p><p>“And this is your flower shop?”</p><p>“Yeah, do you like it?”</p><p>“I do.” Agatha snuggled into her. “I wish I could see it with my own eyes.”</p><p>“Me too,” Rio answered. “Me too.”</p><p>Rio showed Agatha more photos, pictures of New York which she didn’t believe were real, of nights out at bars, food snaps and some from their time in 21<sup>st</sup> century Salem which she found quite interesting. When the battery dipped towards 50%, Rio turned the phone off.</p><p>“Maybe next time I can show you some music,” Rio suggested. “I could teach you how to dance like we’re at prom.”</p><p>“Prom?”</p><p>“Like a dance when you’re at school.”</p><p>“Like at the market?”</p><p>“A bit more formal than that.”</p><p>Agatha took her hand. “You must miss your time.”</p><p>“I do,” Rio admitted, before squeezing Agatha’s hand. “But a little less each day.”</p><p>Agatha got to her feet, pulling Rio up with her. “Come. I want to do what we did this morning.”</p><p>Rio followed her upstairs without argument.</p><p> </p><p>The next morning, Agatha woke up with Rio, and after some heated kisses, they pulled themselves out of bed at the sound of Scratchy’s impatient thumping.</p><p>Rio saw to the house while Agatha got to work making breakfast. They ate together while Scratchy enjoyed some leafage from the garden, and everything was fine…until Agatha suddenly jumped out of her seat.</p><p>“I need to make sure the house is clean, and get some food for dinner, and hide all signs of magic, because you’re not meant to know and mother will scold me if she found out I told a mortal about…”</p><p>“Woah, woah, woah.” Rio got up and grasped her wife’s shoulders. “Sweetheart, calm down. Everything will be fine. I’ll fetch us a fresh chicken once I’ve picked up the latest papers from Mr Davis, and I’ll make sure dinner is ready. Why don’t you go to Lilia’s and get some fresh vegetables from her garden, perhaps also some apples for dessert. As for the house, it’s perfectly fine. All our magic stuff are either locked away or up in our bedroom, and she sure as hell isn’t going in there.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Sorry, I just suddenly remembered and…”</p><p>“Don’t worry.” Rio kissed her forehead. “Whatever happens, this is our house. You’re your own person, but even in this messed up patriarchy, you’re not hers. I’m your husband, and I’ll make sure she fucking knows it.”</p><p>That got her a smile and Rio sealed it with a peck on her nose, which made her laugh.</p><p>“You’re quite something, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“As are you, Agatha Vidal.”</p><p>“Ah, you’re finally remembering.”</p><p>Rio responded with a deep kiss.</p><p>Once ready for the day, they both left their house and walked together until their paths diverged, Agatha heading out of town towards Lilia’s, while Rio moved to the centre. There, she collected her papers from Mr Davis and got a fresh chicken from the local butcher, and once home, she prepared the bird for cooking.</p><p>She had begun to roast it in the stone oven when her wife returned home with a basket filled with vegetables and apples.</p><p>“Lilia gave us all the good stuff,” Agatha announced, greeting her wife with a kiss before placing the basket on the kitchen table. “Think we can work with this?”</p><p>Rio rummaged through it and nodded. “We’re good to go, my love.”</p><p>“Great, because I don’t want to give that woman any excuse to complain, though she’ll likely find a reason.”</p><p>“If she does, she does. It doesn’t matter to us.”</p><p>“I know, I know.” Agatha took off her cloak. “Lilia is well.”</p><p>“She is?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “She’s helping me get you a surprise.”</p><p>“She is?”</p><p>“Yes, but you’ll have to wait until it’s ready. First of all, we have to survive this dinner my mother. And trust me, my love, it won’t be easy.”</p><p>Rio grimaced. It was going to be a long evening.</p><p> </p><p>Evanora Harkness arrived at their doorstep a little before dusk, and pushed her way inside as soon as Rio opened the door.</p><p>“Welcome, Evanora,” Rio sassed. “Please, come into our home.”</p><p>“I need to see where my only child is living,” Evanora insisted as she began to look around the hallway. “Not bad.”</p><p>“It’s a work in progress,” Rio told her. “Once my renovations are done, Agatha and I are going to Boston for furnishings.”</p><p>“Unless she is with child by then,” Evanora commented. “Speaking of which, where is my daughter?”</p><p>“Preparing dinner.” Rio headed towards the kitchen. “Please, follow me.”</p><p>She led Evanora to the kitchen, where Agatha was preparing the serving dishes. When she spotted her mother, Rio saw her entire body tense as she greeted the woman with a tight smile.</p><p>“Mother. Welcome. Dinner won’t be long.”</p><p>“I’ll assist you.” Evanora moved across the kitchen, before turning back to shoo Rio away. “Leave us to it, Captain. This is women’s work.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, and when she nodded, she edged back towards the door. “I will go open some wine.”</p><p>Once Rio had retrieved a bottle from the store and fought to get the cork out, Agatha and Evanora were carrying dinner through. There was already a stiffness in the air, and she wondered what her mother-in-law had said to her wife in her absence.</p><p>They sat at the table and Rio reached over to begin carving the chicken, only for Evanora to clear her throat sharply.</p><p>“Do you not say grace, Captain Vidal?”</p><p>“Not really, but if you wish to you can.” Rio continued to carve the chicken. She stole a glance at Agatha and saw she was biting back a laugh. Evanora, however, was not impressed.</p><p>“Are you not a God-fearing man, Captain?”</p><p>“I fear a lot of things,” Rio said as she began to share out the cuts of meat. “Sea storms, large creatures under the depths, rough waves, shipwreck. I’m still here and I never once said a blessing.”</p><p>Evanora clearly wasn’t impressed but accepted the cuts of chicken Rio plated up for her.</p><p>They began eating in a stiff silence, so grating Rio found it hard to swallow without making a gulping sound. After a while, she’d had enough and decided to make conversation.</p><p>“So Evanora, how are things in the lower village?”</p><p>“Fine,” Evanora answered. “The housework is hard now Agatha has gone, but I have had help from my neighbours.”</p><p>“Oh, well that’s nice of them,” Rio replied, only to see her wife frown.</p><p>“What neighbours?”</p><p>“Those of our…our congregation,” Evanora answered. “They have taken pity on me, seeing my own daughter has neglected her mother.”</p><p>“You told me not to come back,” Agatha reminded her, at which Evanora shot her a glare.</p><p>“A proper daughter would have invited her mother to live in this grand house with her, yet here you live in your luxury while your mother lives in squaller.”</p><p>Agatha went to argue, but Rio jumped in first. “It was my decision to keep the house as just our own. I wish to enjoy our time together as newlyweds, and that involves having our privacy.”</p><p>“Privacy,” Evanora repeated. “And would you have not moved <em>your </em>mother in here, Captain?”</p><p>“I can’t answer that,” Rio answered. “I have no mother.”</p><p>“Impossible,” Evanora dismissed. “No child simply falls into existence.”</p><p>“I barely knew her,” Rio lied, recalling the lie she told Ralph in the tavern, what seemed like a lifetime ago. “I lived with my father on the ships until he also died.”</p><p>“So you are an orphan?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “All I have of my mother rests on Agatha’s finger.”</p><p>Evanora’s eyes gravitated to the ring. “You must have been born with money, then.”</p><p>“Perhaps, but I saw little of it. I have made my own way in the world.”</p><p>Evanora ate some more of her chicken. “Agatha’s cooking has improved since she left me. This is actually cooked through.”</p><p>“Don’t exaggerate, Mother,” Agatha huffed. “My cooking was fine.”</p><p>“Watch your lip, girl,” Evanora snapped. “Married or not, I am still your mother. You are never too old to be scolded.”</p><p>Rio’s grip tightened around her knife. She truly hated the woman with every fibre of her being.</p><p>“Yes, I am married now, Mother,” Agatha snapped. “You can’t tell me what to do anymore.”</p><p>“You insolent child!” Evanora slammed her cutlery on the table. “I see marriage has not absolved you of your sinful ways.”</p><p>“My wife isn’t sinful,” Rio cut in. “Now please, eat your dinner. It took all day to prepare.”</p><p>Evanora reached for her glass and finished off her wine. “I hope the arrival my eventual grandchild will put you both in a proper mind. To say grace and respect your elders. Though I am surprised you have not already begun to show.”</p><p>Agatha put down her cutlery and folded her arms. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“Nothing, my dear. I just hope my grandchild’s sinful creation won’t bring the same result as your own.”</p><p>“My child with Rio could never be sinful,” Agatha snapped, jumping to her feet. “Unlike you, I waited until I was wed to consummate our love. <em>You</em>, on the other hand, conceived me in lust with not even a promise of betrothment.”</p><p>Evanora shot up also. “You vile evil-tongued harlot! You are the price of my sin, and I should have killed you the moment you left my body.”</p><p>And then, Rio snapped.</p><p>“ENOUGH.” She got to her feet with such force that her chair crashed backwards to the ground. She looked to Evanora with a deadly glare. “I will not have my wife spoken to in such a way, especially by a bitter old hag such as yourself.”</p><p>Evanora scoffed. “The insolence! You listen to me, Captain. She is my daughter, and I will speak to you as I see fit.”</p><p> Rio stepped towards her, making sure to use as much of her slight height advantage she had to look down at her disgrace of a mother-in-law. “Get out of my fucking house, you stupid old bitch. You are no longer welcome in my home, and Agatha will see you no more. That is <em>my</em> decision as her husband.”</p><p>“You pig!” Evanora spat. “You cannot keep me from my daughter.”</p><p>“Oh, I can,” Rio snapped. “And any child we may have. Now, I will tell you one more time, Evanora. Get. Out. Of. My. House.”</p><p>Evanora held her glare for a moment before storming off towards the door, Rio close behind her. She threw open the door and marched down the steps, only to turn back with a vicious sneer.</p><p>“You have no idea who she is, Captain. I would pity you, but I see you deserve all the suffering you are set to endure at my daughter’s hands.”</p><p>“I’m sure I’ll be fine,” Rio replied, before slamming the door shut between them.</p><p>The house was quiet again, the bitch was gone, and she could finally breathe.</p><p>A creak of the floorboards made her look down the hall, and she watched Agatha step out of the dining room, her eyes big and her face unreadable. Rio’s heart sank. She wished with everything in her that her wife didn’t have to see that. That she had a mother like Lilia, who cared for her completely, not tear her down in such an awful way.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio began, but before she could, her wife stormed forward and pushed her against the wall. “Agatha?”</p><p>“I have never wanted anyone as much as I want you,” Agatha said, before kissing her deeply.</p><p>After a moment of shock, Rio melted into the kiss. She recalled their first kiss, one that took place mere steps away from where they were now, but this time was different.</p><p>This time, Agatha’s hand moved to the buttons of her pants.</p><p>Rio quickly pulled back. “Agatha, what are you doing?”</p><p>Agatha let out a husky laugh as she popped all the buttons open. “Isn’t it obvious?” She quickly dropped to her knees. “I want you, my love. Do you want me?”</p><p>Rio stared down at her, suddenly unable to catch her breath. All she could do was nod, and thankfully that was all her wife needed.</p><p>Her pants were yanked down her legs and Agatha’s arms hooped her legs, pulling them open enough before her head dived between her thighs.</p><p>Rio yelped at the first experimental swipe of Agatha’s tongue between her folds, followed by a groan as her wife dived right in.</p><p>Agatha lapped at her like a woman starved, never faltering her deep and determined rhythm. Rio tipped her head back, her knees buckling before Agatha’s hands grasped her thighs to steady her. </p><p>It seemed her wife was a quick study, and Rio worried how she’d survive if this was her first time.</p><p>It didn’t take long for her to approach her peak, and she couldn’t control the sounds leaving her mouth. High pitched and helpless but also begging for more.</p><p>Then Agatha went and pressed her tongue against her entrance. Pushing in once, twice, before shattering her on the third. </p><p>Rio’s world turned white, her entire body riding the sensation, her wife’s mouth riding her through it.</p><p>When she came down, her gaze dropped to Agatha, who was still licking her softly. Her hand moved to touch her hair, and blue eyes looked up at her from between her thighs.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio gasped breathlessly. “That was…wow.”</p><p>Agatha moved back and helped Rio slide down to join her on the floor. She climbed into her lap and nuzzled her neck. “Thank you.”</p><p>“For what?”</p><p>“For getting rid of her.” </p><p>Rio scowled at the thought of <em>that</em> woman. “I won’t let her near you again. What she said was…no one should ever have to hear that. Let alone from their own mother.”</p><p>Agatha pulled back to look at her. “It’s nothing new, Rio. She’s never said it like that before, but I always knew. She never loved me, never wanted me. Now you see why I needed your magic. I could have used it to escape her, finally. So it could be me and Lilia against the world. Little did I know, I didn’t need your magic. I just needed you.”</p><p>Rio reached out and cupped her face. “She was so wrong. I don’t understand how anyone could look at you and not see how strong and amazing you are. I’m so glad you were born, my love. I’m so glad that you’re here right now. I’m so glad you exist. I…I love you, Agatha.”</p><p>Blue eyes widened. “Y-you do?”</p><p>“I do.” Rio stroked her cheek with her thumb. “I know it’s sudden and this was never meant to be anything more than a sham, but I love you. I love you so fucking much and I can’t help it. You’ve made the worst thing that ever happened to me the fucking best, and I wish…I wish I could marry you for real. I wish we could have a family and live here in this house until we’re old and grey. I love you, Agatha Vidal. Every single wonderfully stubborn part.”</p><p>Tears welled in Agatha’s eyes, and she quickly drives into her arms. “I love you. I love you so fucking much, Rio.”</p><p>Rio grinned and buried her face in her wife’s hair. “I’m so happy right now. My chest feels like it’s going to explode.”</p><p>“Mine too,” Agatha answered, placing gentle kisses against her neck. “I’ve never been so happy in my entire life.”</p><p>Rio held her tight, with her pants round her ankles in the middle of their downstairs hallway. Yet, like the insane, stubborn, mischievously amazing woman in her arms, it was totally perfect.</p>
