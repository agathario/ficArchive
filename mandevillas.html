</p><p>
<span>The flower had shown up on her wrist when she was twelve years old, just barely out of childhood and into adolescence. Rio had heard of these marks, had even seen the ones her parents shared (a sun and moon intertwined) and listened to the stories with a light heart, dreaming about the day when she would meet the soul who shared a similar mark on their wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Her</span>
</em>
<span> wrist.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was sixteen when she came to the conclusion that she would never love a man. She found them utterly disgusting. They were hairy and rough, and she just did not understand the appeal. Her classmates would giggle in the presence of boys and men, offering handkerchiefs and blown kisses to them. Rio, on the other hand, found her heart only skipped a beat around other girls. She flushed when girls paid her compliments and thrilled when her hand brushed against the skin of a girl as she handed her something.</span>
</p><p>
<span>When it came time for her to find a partner so that she could take her parents’ throne (for she could only do so if she were married and expecting an heir to follow in the bloodline), she explained to her parents that she would never take a husband. She’d rather abdicate her claim to the throne than allow herself to be wed to a man. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Well, her parents didn’t want that. They were getting on in years, too old to have another child and raise it to follow in their footsteps. And they loved their daughter, supported what her heart wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<span>So they went to the home of a local sorceress, begging for her advice (in exchange for a generous amount of coin, of course).</span>
</p><p>
<span>The sorceress, Lilia Calderu, sat them at her table and looked into her crystal ball, waving her hands around the object as it seemed to fill with smoke, the sorceress’s eyes seeming to glow as she looked down into it, wind from an unknown source flowing through her hair in an otherwise shut-off room. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me,” she said, looking up at the wide-eyed regents, “has your daughter met her soulmate yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not that we’re aware of,” King Santiago said. “This is the kind of thing she would tell us, I’m sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Can you locate her?” Queen Marisol asked. “</span>
<em>
<span>Have</span>
</em>
<span> you located her?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have,” Lilia confirmed. “She is in a neighboring kingdom, not far from here. She is not a princess, I’m afraid, but she </span>
<em>
<span>is</span>
</em>
<span> of noble birth. A duchess. Her name,” Lilia said, with a soft smile, still moving her hands around the crystal ball, revealing the face of a young woman through the smoke, “is Agatha Harkness.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha!</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha woke with a start, sitting up in bed, her hair a knotted mess on her head, a line of dried drool on her cheek. The curtains of her bedroom were still closed, keeping out the morning light, but it must have been late. Her mother rarely deigned to raise her voice this early in the morning.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Agatha Harkness!</span>
</em>
<span>” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stumbled out of her bed, reaching for her robe and shrugging into it, attempting to brush out her hair at her vanity. Her mother had warned her about going to bed without braiding her hair and wrapping it in silk, and now look at it. She would </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> hear the end of it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha! What are you doing, you lazy child?!” There came a pounding at her doors, which she had locked the night before. The maids had the key, but her mother did not.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m coming, Mother!” Agatha said, hissing as she hit a stubborn knot in her hair. She rushed to brush through it, smoothing it out as much as she could before she rushed toward the door, undoing the locks and tugging open the heavy wooden doors, stepping aside before she could be trampled by her mother and her mother’s lady-in-waiting, Mrs. Davis.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you still doing undressed!?” Evanora Harkness exclaimed, stomping into the room. “Your bed is unmade!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The maids haven’t been in yet,” Agatha retorted, wrapping her robe more tightly around herself, yawning into her palm. “What time is it?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s nearly seven!” Evanora exclaimed. Agatha groaned.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, that’s why!” she said. “I’ve </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> been woken up before eight. Why should today be any different?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Because we are </span>
<em>
<span>about</span>
</em>
<span> to have company,” Evanora growled at her, teeth bared. Agatha took a step away from her, shoulders hunched. Her mother could be terrifying sometimes, especially with the sharpness of her teeth making her look something akin to a wolf. “You need to get washed and dressed before they arrive.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who is </span>
<em>
<span>they</span>
</em>
<span>?” Agatha asked, furrowing her brow. “I have not been informed that we were to have company. Had I been, I would have made certain that I–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m </span>
<em>
<span>sure</span>
</em>
<span> you would have,” Evanora huffed, ironically. “Because you, my daughter, are </span>
<em>
<span>so</span>
</em>
<span> well-known for minding your mother and doing as told.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Have I not done what’s been asked of me in the past?” Agatha asked, annoyance rising in her chest that she found to tamp down. “Have I not gotten good marks in my lessons? Have I not done whatever chores you and Father have asked me to do? What is it that makes you look down on me so, Mother?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You are </span>
<em>
<span>evil</span>
</em>
<span>,” Evanora hissed at her, even as she and her lady pulled open the drapes, allowing the early morning light into the room. “As I’ve told you many, </span>
<em>
<span>many</span>
</em>
<span> times before. You do not break the rules, but you </span>
<em>
<span>bend</span>
</em>
<span> them to your will. You find ways </span>
<em>
<span>around</span>
</em>
<span> them, your wicked mind disloyal by nature.” She took a deep breath. “And, today, I am finally to be rid of you.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened at that, the ache in her chest at her mother’s undue cruelty making way for the shock her words brought. “What do you mean?” she asked. “Where am I </span>
<em>
<span>going</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“A suitor is coming to meet you this morning,” Evanora told her. “They are offering a handsome dowry for your hand in marriage </span>
<em>
<span>if</span>
</em>
<span> you impress them.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I am only eighteen,” Agatha said, her spine straightening. “You and Father promised that my hand would be promised to </span>
<em>
<span>no one</span>
</em>
<span> until I was at least–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Circumstances have changed,” Evanora hummed, nonchalantly. “And we are not obligated to keep promises to </span>
<em>
<span>you.</span>
</em>
<span> We are your parents: we decide when your hand will be given in marriage and to </span>
<em>
<span>whom</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother, I–”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Enough!” Evanora boomed, turning to face Agatha, fully, her eyes wide with anger, teeth once again bared to her. “You </span>
<em>
<span>will</span>
</em>
<span> be on your best behavior for this suitor, for if he rejects you and refuses to pay the dowry, I will make your life a </span>
<em>
<span>living hell</span>
</em>
<span> until you </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> married off. Is that understood, Agatha Harkness?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her lips together, taking in a shuddering breath through her nose, attempting to compose herself, then nodded mutely.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Evanora sniffed, turning to her lady. “Go fetch the maids and tell them that the young duchess needs a bath before her suitor’s arrival. Go on.” Mrs. Davis nodded, bowing to the lady before running off, leaving Agatha under her mother’s scrutiny. “Now,” she said, “go wait for them in the washroom while I pick out a suitable gown. I don’t wish to see your face anymore until it’s been scrubbed.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, looking down at her feet as she shuffled to the washroom attached to her bed chambers. She shut the door as she stepped inside, pressing her back against it and covering her mouth as the tears began to fall.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio had a habit of tracing the petals of the flower on her wrist, counting them and imagining that she could actually feel their velvety softness. Because of the marking, she had grown quite fond of mandevilla flowers. They grew wild in her kingdom, so she’d always had a vase of them in her room, becoming familiar with their scent and texture over the last six years since the marking showed up. Unlike the real flowers, the marking on her hand had no coloring between the lines. There were details that suggested the texture and shading, but the inside of the flower was the same olive tone as Rio’s skin.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“When you meet your soulmate,” her father had said once, when she’d asked him as he put her to bed, “the marking will fill with color, as mine and your mother’s markings did.” He showed her the sun and moon tattoo, which was blue on the moon half and orange-yellow on the sun half. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does that happen the </span>
<em>
<span>second</span>
</em>
<span> we meet?” Rio had asked, as her father pulled the blanket up to almost her chin, tucking it all around underneath her body.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The second your skin touches,” Santiago promised. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Does it hurt?” she asked, nervously.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“There is no pain,” her father assured her, kissing her forehead. “Just…warmth. It feels warm, like somebody has wrapped their hand around your wrist.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Like in a wedding ceremony,” Rio said, smiling dreamily. In their kingdom, the betrothed wrapped their hands firmly around one another’s wrists, pulling each other in, after they’ve said their vows, for their union kiss. She had always imagined doing the same at her own wedding ever since she was a small child.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exactly,” Santiago whispered, smiling down at her. “Someday, you will experience that joy, mi vida. Until then, however, </span>
<em>
<span>duerme</span>
</em>
<span>.” He pressed another kiss to her forehead, and Rio rolled her eyes, turning onto her side, her fingers still stroking her marking.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Now, as they rode their carriage from the safety of their own kingdom into the unknown lands just a few miles to the west, Rio’s fingers ran over those same lines, her mind drifting as she looked out the window, imagining what this girl - this </span>
<em>
<span>soulmate</span>
</em>
<span> of hers - would look like. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her parents had already made the offer to the Duchess’s family for her hand in marriage, but they’d made it clear that Rio could back out if she wanted. Just because the sorceress they’d hired </span>
<em>
<span>said</span>
</em>
<span> that she was Rio’s soulmate didn’t make that accurate. Sorceresses had been known to tell falsehoods.</span>
</p><p>
<span>She hoped that wasn’t the case.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Mija</span>
</em>
<span>,” Queen Marisol said, placing her hand over Rio’s on her wrist, “stop rubbing. You’ll give yourself another rash.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s finger paused and she pulled it away from her wrist. “Sorry,” she said. “I’m nervous.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, querida,” Marisol whispered, “but it will be okay. If Lilia is right, you two should get off to a </span>
<em>
<span>great</span>
</em>
<span> start. It will be love at first sight.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart fluttered at that, and she sat a little straighter in her seat. She was wearing a gown in her favorite color (green) and her raven black hair fell around her shoulders in loose waves. Her mother had insisted that she wear a tiara, as well, since they were leaving their own kingdom for the day. It was simple, made of steel, rather than any precious metals, and embedded with a single emerald in the center. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Her parents each wore coronets rather than their typical jeweled crowns. Their clothes were complementary shades of royal blue and warm yellow, matching well with one another. They held hands across from Rio, their fingers intertwined. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had never seen any two people more in love than her parents, and she hoped that she would find that with this girl today.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>hated</span>
</em>
<span> wearing dresses. They were always too tight to allow her to take more than a shallow breath here and there. The skirts were too thick and long for her to walk properly without slightly holding them up to make space for her feet to take small, cautious steps. And the sleeves were always far too long and tight, making her feel as though she’d put her hand directly into the mouth of a snake. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> hated wearing dresses. Or </span>
<em>
<span>gowns</span>
</em>
<span>, at least. Attending court was the worst because the young women wore </span>
<em>
<span>nothing but</span>
</em>
<span> gowns. And they were forced to dance with </span>
<em>
<span>men </span>
</em>
<span>– boys, rather. Boys with sweaty palms and hair on their lips that looked more like the crumbs of whatever food they’d just been shoving into their gaping maws. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hated dancing with boys even more than she hated walking in gowns.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Today, she would likely have to do </span>
<em>
<span>both</span>
</em>
<span> as her suitor arrived. She sat in the parlor at half past ten, freshly bathed, dried, dressed, and made up like a prized pig. Her mother had chosen a pale blue gown for her to wear, saying that her suitor would appreciate the way the color matched her blue eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Men had always swooned over her blue eyes more than anything. Sometimes, that made Agatha hate her own eyes, too.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re arriving!” one of the servants called, popping his head into the house. “There’s a carriage up the road with flags that are not from this land.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re coming!” Evanora said, getting to her feet. “Your Grace,” she called to Agatha’s father, </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> husband, “come now. They’re arriving!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Coming,” Duke Harkness called. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha heard her father rise from his desk in the study, heard the creak of his old chair and the sound of his footsteps. Her mother pulled her to her feet and brushed her off as though she’d gathered cobwebs in the twenty minutes since she’d sat down.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You be on your </span>
<em>
<span>best</span>
</em>
<span> behavior,” she warned. “No. Even </span>
<em>
<span>better</span>
</em>
<span> behavior than that, actually. You behave like one of your schoolmates, the ones that have </span>
<em>
<span>manners</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I have never had a rude word to say to </span>
<em>
<span>anybody</span>
</em>
<span>, Mother,” Agatha huffed. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora reached down and pinched her arm through her sleeve, </span>
<em>
<span>hard</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“You do well to hold your tongue, Agatha Harkness,” she hissed. “Husbands do not take kindly to mouthy wives. You will </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> like the way they go about taming them.” </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bit back her remark at that, her teeth sinking into the inside of her cheeks as she held back tears. She simply nodded, following her mother toward the foyer, where they met her father.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Duke Harkness was a soft-looking man. He had rounded features, a soft midsection, and dark hair that fell in waves when it wasn’t tied at the base of his skull. Agatha got a few of her features from him, including the ice blue gaze that so many men adored, but her sharp jawline was her mother’s, as was the way she thinned her lips in displeasure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Who is this suitor, again?” the duke asked Evanora.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“His name is Rio Vidal,” Evanora said, straightening her husband’s coat, smoothing down the rich velvet. “He is from </span>
<em>
<span>Esperanza</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Exotic,” Duke Harkness said, glancing at his daughter. “I hear it’s lovely this time of year. You’ll like it there, pet.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha clenched her jaw: she </span>
<em>
<span>abhorred </span>
</em>
<span>that nickname. She nodded but said nothing, still biting her cheek, still holding back her tears. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Come now,” Evanora said. “We must greet them as they emerge from their carriage lest they think us inconsiderate.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Inconsiderate was the perfect word to describe Evanora Harkness. She never thought of anybody’s wants, needs, or feelings except her own. She only cared about others as far as what they could do </span>
<em>
<span>for her</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha would not miss that when she was forced to marry this man from Esperanza. She wondered if he would be nice, at least. Nicer than her parents.</span>
</p><p>
<span>That was a low bar to set.</span>
</p><p>
<span>A servant opened the door for them, and Agatha followed her parents out into the front driveway, tripping a bit on her skirts over the uneven gravel. She cleared her throat, her cheeks flushing with embarrassment as her mother glared at her over her shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Just then, a carriage appeared over the bend in the road and Agatha’s stomach dropped. This was it. This was the end of her life as she knew it. Looking at her parents, she had the fleeting thought that it couldn’t truly be </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> bad if they were what she was leaving behind, but still…</span>
</p><p>
<span>The carriage came to a stop just a few feet in front of them and the footman got down to open the door. He rapped twice on it first, waiting for a knock in return before he pressed on the latch.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Introducing,” he said, “King Santiago and Queen Marisol of Esperanza.” He bowed as he pulled open the door, allowing the regents to step out of the carriage. The man came first, wearing a deep blue suit with gold accents and a grand coronet around his black head of hair. His eyes were a warm brown, though Agatha was careful to avoid her gaze as she curtsied.</span>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nobody</span>
</em>
<span> had said anything about a king and queen!</span>
</p><p>
<span>He reached in his hand, helping his wife from the carriage next. </span>
</p><p>
<span>The queen was absolutely </span>
<em>
<span>breathtaking</span>
</em>
<span>. She had on a warm yellow gown with bronze accents, her coronet matching her dear husband’s, sitting gracefully on her head. She offered the duke and duchesses a warm smile as she smoothed down her skirts, still holding her husband’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Please,” she said, “straighten yourselves. We are almost family now.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, straightening up first, much to her mother’s displeasure.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Welcome to our home, Your Majesty,” Evanora said, her voice dripping with syrupy sweetness that Agatha had never heard before. She and her father shared a sidelong glance at the tone. “Thank you so much for gracing us with your presence.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>De nada</span>
</em>
<span>,” the queen said with a soft smile, her eyes drifting over to Agatha, whose spine straightened. “Is this the lovely young duchess?” she asked, walking forward. “</span>
<em>
<span>Ay. Que linda</span>
</em>
<span>.” She tucked her fingers under Agatha’s chin, turning her face gently this way and that as she examined her. “Strong jaw, </span>
<em>
<span>gorgeous</span>
</em>
<span> eyes…soft skin…” She stroked Agatha’s blushing cheeks. “You will make a good match for my Rio,” she said. “</span>
<em>
<span>If</span>
</em>
<span> you accept, of course, </span>
<em>
<span>querida</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course she accepts,” Evanora cut in before Agatha could say a single word. “She is so </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> excited to meet your son.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“My </span>
<em>
<span>son</span>
</em>
<span>?” The queen laughed, shaking her head. “I think there may have been a misunderstanding.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha furrowed her brow, matching her mother’s look of confusion. Queen Marisol smiled at them, turning back to the carriage. “Rio, amor, come meet your bride.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes widened as a skirt preceded the next figure to emerge from the carriage. Her heart began to pound in her chest as a face followed it - the most beautiful face she’d ever seen in her life. It made her face flush and her knees go a little weak, her palms sweating as they clenched at her skirts, nearly falling over in her attempt to curtsy again.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I present,” the footman said as the king helped his </span>
<em>
<span>daughter</span>
</em>
<span> out of the carriage, smiling affectionately at her in a way the </span>
<em>
<span>Duke</span>
</em>
<span> had never smiled at Agatha, “Princess Rio of Esperanza.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>The woman was her age, which Agatha had already known, but she was a </span>
<em>
<span>woman</span>
</em>
<span>, which Agatha had </span>
<em>
<span>not</span>
</em>
<span> known. Her parents seemed to not know this as well. Her mother likely would have </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> approved a union had she known, princess or not. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t keep her eyes off of her, though. She had her father’s deep brown eyes and hair, which fell in waves around her shoulders, cascading down over her green gown, which fit her much better than any of Agatha’s dresses had </span>
<em>
<span>ever</span>
</em>
<span> fit </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span>. The rest of her was almost the mirror image of her mother, from her kind smile and the shape of her eyes, to the jawline and arch of her eyebrows. She was also just a few inches taller and a bit slimmer than her mother, but otherwise Agatha felt as though she were looking at present and future versions of the same person.</span>
</p><p>
<span>And she wasn’t upset about it.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Isn’t she beautiful?” Queen Marisol said, but she was looking at Princess Rio, holding Agatha’s hand as she motioned toward her. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“I agree,” Rio said, smiling at Agatha as she stepped forward. She curtsied. “Milady,” she said, holding out her hand. Agatha just stared at it for a second before reaching out.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait just a moment,” Evanora said, reaching out to slap Agatha’s hand back down. “With all due respect, you have tricked us, Your Majesty.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“How so?” the queen asked. Her husband came to stand right up behind her, his hulking figure a bit imposing.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Eva…” Duke Harkness said in a warning tone, placing his hand on his wife’s shoulder. Evanora shrugged it off.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You led us to believe that it was a </span>
<em>
<span>man</span>
</em>
<span> asking for our daughter’s hand in marriage. </span>
<em>
<span>That</span>
</em>
<span> is what we agreed to!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We did </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span> such thing!” King Santiago said, evenly. “Every noble family as far as the eye can see knows that we have no sons, only a daughter. Most of them were there to welcome her after her birth. I know your family must have received the invitation.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You expect us to remember the sex of a child born nearly two decades ago!?” Evanore huffed, crossing her arms over her chest. “Ridiculous!”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Evanora, </span>
<em>
<span>enough</span>
</em>
<span>!” Duke Harkness said, his voice more firm than Agatha had ever heard it. “Step aside.” His tone caught even Evanora off guard. She stared up at him, speechless, until he gently pushed her aside, offering the king and queen an apologetic smile. “Forgive her,” he begged. “She is simply…taken aback. We both are. We were expecting somebody…else.” He eyed the princess, who didn’t hesitate to eye him back, one brow lifted in defiance. “I’m sure that your daughter is lovely. She certainly </span>
<em>
<span>looks</span>
</em>
<span> like a lovely girl, but…”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you refuse our dowry then?” King Santiago asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Pardon?” Duke Harkness asked, eyes widening.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“The money you were only too happy to accept when you believed our child to be male…do you reject it now?” The king’s tone was unwavering. His gaze matched his wife’s and his daughter’s as all three stared at the duke.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s more complicated than that,” Duke Harkness said. “What would others think if we let our daughter marry another woman?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do you care?” Queen Marisol asked. “Your king doesn’t care. Does </span>
<em>
<span>his</span>
</em>
<span> daughter not have a wife in Princess Alice? This is no different, is it? Unless you think yourself and your family are better than the king?” Her eyebrows rose at that. “</span>
<em>
<span>Do</span>
</em>
<span> you think this?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“N-no,” Duke Harkness stuttered. “Of course not! I-I just…” He looked at his wife and daughter.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, rolling her eyes. “I, personally,” she said, “have no issue with this arrangement.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Just this morning, you were protesting it!” Evanora hissed at her, eyes practically black with anger.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“And now,” Agatha said, emboldened by this family and their defiance, “I have accepted my fate. If it is to be, then it is to be.” She smiled shyly at Rio, holding out her hand. “It is lovely to make your acquaintance, my love.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>She watched with a thrill as a blush spread across Rio’s cheeks. The other girl reached out her hand, slipping her fingers into Agatha’s. Agatha felt the warmth of her touch radiate up her arm, spreading warmth throughout her body. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Based on the look on Princess Rio’s face, she was feeling the same.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>A thrill went through Rio’s body as she and Duchess Agatha touched palms. She felt that warmth around her wrist that her father had told her about so many times and her eyes widened as she gazed into the deep ocean blue of Agatha’s, her cheeks flushing. </span>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled her hand from Agatha’s grasp, tugging her loose sleeve up her arm, her breath catching at the deep velvety purple that filled the flower that had long just been an outline on her arm. She looked up at Agatha with a smile spreading her lips, stepping forward to cup the other girl’s cheeks in her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s you,” she breathed in the space between her lips. “You are the one I’ve been looking for.” She searched her love’s gaze, looking for permission to do what she had been longing to do for years before she’d ever even seen her face. Agatha’s gaze flickered down to her lips, then back up, her throat bobbing as she swallowed thickly. “Can I kiss you?” Rio asked, as if reading the other girl’s mind. Agatha nodded, enthusiastically, and Rio grinned as she leaned in, pressing her mouth to Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha!” her mother’s shrill voice came from next to them, but Agatha just kissed Rio harder, almost defiantly, her arms wrapping around Rio’s shoulders as Rio’s hands dropped to stroke up and down her back, pulling her closer until their chests were pressed together.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Evanora,” Agatha’s father said, with a long-suffering sigh, “let it go.” The sound of the shrill woman’s voice got further away as she continued to argue, but Rio didn’t care. She was only focused on the woman in her arms, their lips fitting together like puzzle pieces. </span>
</p><p>
<span>It was as close to the heavens as Rio had ever been.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s flower was green, not purple, which seemed to confuse Rio as they rode together in the carriage to Esperanza. Agatha had made quick work of packing her belongings - of which, she had few. She had a few lightweight dresses that she liked; a locket her father had once brought back from his travels; some hair brushes and oils; and the yellow speckled bunny she had caught in the gardens, which she had convinced her father to let her keep as a companion despite her mother’s protests.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Scratchy sat in her lap on the trip, snoozing against her belly as she and Rio stroked his soft fur. She had changed into a dress with loose sleeves. It was in her preferred shade of purple, a nice light lavender color. It made it easier to see the flower marking that had shown up just after her first menstrual cycle. Her parents each had one, as well, though theirs were mismatched and colorless. They knew about the soulmate legends, but her mother insisted that </span>
<em>
<span>nobles don’t get to have soulmates</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<span>King Santiago and Queen Marisol proved that wrong, though, as they showed Agatha their matching sun and moon markings, colored in blue and yellow.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Why don’t ours match?” Agatha asked, frowning at the mismatched colors of hers and Rio’s flowers (mandevillas, she had called them; Agatha had always wondered.)</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Not all markings are the same,” Santiago said. “I’ve seen some that even change color over time. Those seem to be complementary colors.” He smiled softly. “Funny that yours happens to be my daughter’s favorite color.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled in return. “Purple is mine,” she said, looking sideways at Rio, who leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Agatha’s lips. Agatha sighed softly, her cheeks turning pink. “We do truly complete each other, don’t we?”</span>
</p><p>
<span>“We do,” Rio agreed, pressing her forehead to Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<span>They married the following summer, on a hillside in Esperanza. Duke Harkness was in attendance, as was Mrs. Davis, his wife’s lady-in-waiting, who had helped to raise Agatha from infancy.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora Harkness was notably absent.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t have cared less, however, as she stood at the end of the aisle, dressed in a traditional Esperanzan suit made of purple velvet, accented with silver, emeralds embedded in her earrings and the headpiece she wore. She had told Rio about her hatred of extravagant gowns, and they’d experimented with suits, which Agatha found that she had preferred. Nobody in Esperanza seemed to mind her more masculine fits, and Agatha didn’t think she would have cared even if they did. The suits made her feel more confident, more like herself. </span>
</p><p>
<span>And they made her look </span>
<em>
<span>good</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio certainly seemed to think so as evidenced by the flush on her cheeks as she walked down the aisle, a bouquet of multicolored mandevillas in her hands, her forest green dress draped over her body almost like a cloak, trailing behind her like a waterfall. Agatha’s breath caught in her lungs at the sight of her, tears filling her eyes and spilling over her cheeks at the sight of her bride.</span>
</p><p>
<span>King Santiago and Queen Marisol walked with her, each of them holding one of her arms hooked in their own. At the end of the aisle, she pressed a kiss to each of their cheeks in turn, then stood facing Agatha, her smile widening so much that it hurt her cheeks, but she couldn’t stop. Agatha swooned, the tiny gap between Rio’s front teeth a welcome and adored sight.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You look beautiful,” she mouthed to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“You too,” Rio mouthed back.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Shall we begin?” Lilia Calderu, the sorceress and officiant, asked, looking between them. </span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s parents had asked her to bless their union, to grant them magic so that they might be able to conceive a child somehow. It was possible, they knew, as Princesses Jennifer and Alice, from Agatha’s land of Westview, had done it recently, welcoming their own daughter, Princess Willow, just weeks earlier, bearing the features of both mothers.</span>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was nervous at the prospect of children, but one look at Rio and all those fears melted away.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m ready,” she said, smiling directly at Rio even as she answered Lilia’s question.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too,” Rio said, taking her hand.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Prince Nicholas Harkness Vidal was born two years later, after twenty-two grueling hours. In the midst of it, Agatha pledged that she would </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> do it again, the pain of her body tearing itself in two for this child almost too much for her to bear, even with Lilia’s magic helping her along.</span>
</p><p>
<span>But then she held their son in her arms, with Rio’s olive skin and her brown eyes and raven curls and pouty lips, and she looked up at her wife with glittering eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Nine months growing in my belly,” she said. “Twenty-two and a half hours of pushing him through a </span>
<em>
<span>very</span>
</em>
<span> sensitive area, thinking that I might die for the simple </span>
<em>
<span>attempt</span>
</em>
<span>…and he has the </span>
<em>
<span>audacity</span>
</em>
<span> to look nothing like me. I would like a do-over.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cackled, pressing her lips to Agatha’s sweaty temple. “We can have as many as you want, my love,” she said, grasping Agatha’s wrist in her hand as she kissed her, rubbing her thumb over the green flower petals. “We have all the time in the world.”</span>
