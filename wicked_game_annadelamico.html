<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal always got what she wanted.</p><p>It was in her blood. Her father had always taught her nothing wasn’t impossible for a Vidal, to never accept anything less than the best, and she held that close to her chest.</p><p>Hence why she was arguing with someone from her marketing team before when she was set to head out for the evening.</p><p>“I said green. That isn’t green.”</p><p>“But turquoise tested better,” the marketing director insisted.</p><p>“I don’t care. Green is the brand. We’re sticking with that.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“Green. End of discussion.” She hung up the phone and gave Alice an apologetic smile. “Sorry.”</p><p>“No need to apologize,” Alice teased from where she sat on the edge of the bed. “I love seeing you in boss lady mode.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. She had been friends with Alice for years, after meeting at a mutual friend’s yacht party. What the daughter of a rock legend and an hotel heiress had in common, she wasn’t sure, but they had hit it off immediately. Years later, Alice was a rockstar in her own right, while had become the owner of the Vidal Group, but they were just still as close as ever.</p><p>Which was why, when she received an invite to a charity benefit, she invited her for some good company.</p><p>“Who’s going to be there tonight?” Alice asked. “Anyone we know?”</p><p>“Probably.” Rio put her earrings in. “It’s a good tax write-off.”</p><p>“Surely some of them care about the kids?”</p><p>“I hope so.” Rio checked her reflection in the mirror. “I’m planning on donating a purpose-built playground. I have all the details sorted.”</p><p>“I thought it was going to be an auction?”’</p><p>“Yes. I plan to give then too.”</p><p>“So you’re really going for the charity? Not to network?”</p><p>“I don’t need to network,” Rio said dismissively. And she didn’t. No, a Vidal always stood on their own two feet, with nothing but their sharp instinct and a good woman holding them up. She only had the former, but it was enough to keep her upright.</p><p>“I always forget you’re stupid rich,” Alice admitted.</p><p>Rio didn’t like to think of herself as ‘stupid rich’. Perhaps she had the potential to be if her father hadn’t kept her on track. Most heiresses to billion-dollar hotel and business empires wouldn’t bother with education or concentrate on learning how to run the company rather than partying her adolescence away. She had been raised differently, though, and knew that generations of Vidals had worked hard to get her family to where she was now. Yes, she was lucky and lived comfortably, but she never took that for granted. Not for a second.</p><p>No, like her father, she hadn’t paid a single dollar without careful consideration. Her clothes were expensive because they made a good impression. Her cars were shiny and new because efficiency was the key to success. Maybe the yacht was a bit much, but it entertained her friends who offered her endless support. She was the last Vidal, after all. Her family thus became what she made it.</p><p>“I like to consider myself sensibly rich,” Rio corrected, making Alice laugh.</p><p>“You’re such a dork.”</p><p>“Shut up.”</p><p>“You are,” Alice insisted. “And I adore you for it, but maybe it’s time someone else did too.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Not this again.”</p><p>“I just want to you to be happy,” Alice insisted.</p><p>“I am happy.”</p><p>“And in love,” Alice specified. “You’re amazing and deserve to find someone equally as awesome. Why don’t you just try going on some dates? You can’t hold out forever, and a little fun never hurt anyone.”</p><p>“So you’re happy in your current situationship?”</p><p>Alice blushed bright red. “It’s not a situationship. We just keep things casual.”</p><p>“Whatever. Look, you know what my father always told me. Every heir of the Vidal fortune has known exactly who they were going to marry the moment they saw them. My parents, my grandparents, my great grandparents, my great-great…”</p><p>“Okay, okay, I get it.” Alice got to her feet. “I just hope you’re not wasting your life on some family superstition.”</p><p>Rio smiled and cupped her friend’s cheeks. “I have a fantastic life, Alice. Even if I never meet her, I am more than satisfied with what I have. A comfortable lifestyle, a thriving enterprise, and friends I’d trade it all for.”</p><p>Alice smiled at the last part. “You are a big softie.”</p><p>Rio playfully swatted her butt with her clutch purse “Come on, we better go.”</p><p>“Let’s go enjoy ourselves,” Alice proclaimed. “And who knows, your future wife might be there tonight.”</p><p>Rio scoffed. “I doubt it. No one interesting ever turns up to these things.”<br/>
<br/>
Agatha Harkness hated everyone.</p><p>Well, besides her godsons, and her friends, and she guessed her own godmother. Everyone else could go fuck themselves.</p><p>And so when she received an invitation to the benefit for the children’s foundation her godmother donated to, she wanted to rip it up immediately. There was nothing worse than putting on a smile, pretending she didn’t hate 98% of the guest list.</p><p> She had tried to distance herself from that world. The world she had grown up in. Yet, every so often, she had to step back in. Had to become the oddity of the evening, and pretend she was naive to it.</p><p>At least she had been given two tickets. At least she would have an ally…an ally who cried off while Agatha was already on the way there.</p><p>“I’m sorry Agatha. Billy and Tommy have sickness bugs, and I think Vision has it now too.”</p><p>“You’ll be next then.”<br/>
“Wow, thanks for the encouraging words, Agatha,” Wanda huffed. “Can you cover my undergrad class tomorrow if I don’t make it?”</p><p>“What are you teaching?”</p><p>“Macbeth.”</p><p>“Again?”</p><p>“Sorry Shakespeare is too modern for you, Miss Greek Tragedy.”</p><p>“It’s ONE module. It’s not my fault the students love it so much.”</p><p>“You love it and don’t deny it. I know Sappho is your favourite poet.”</p><p>“Second favourite,” Agatha corrected. “Emily Dickinson has my heart.”</p><p>“Whatever. Please? You can do that why Lady Macbeth was in the right debate. That’ll keep them busy.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. Last time she did that, three students almost got suspended. It was totally worth it.</p><p>“Try have a good time,” Wanda encouraged. “Who knows? You might meet someone.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Unlikely.”</p><p>“It will be with that attitude.”</p><p>“You don’t get it, Wanda. I hate the lot of them.”</p><p>“You don’t know half of them.”</p><p>“I hate them by association.”</p><p>“Just show your face and leave if you have to. Now, I’ve got to go. I think Tommy just threw up again.”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“Enjoy the benefit.”</p><p>“Enjoy the vomit.”</p><p>Agatha put the phone down and scowled out of the window. This was going to be painful.</p><p>The benefit was bustling by the time she got there. Agatha grimaced as she walked in. The stench of wealth was overwhelming.</p><p>Everyone was dressed to the nines, making her best dress look pitiful in comparison. People stared at her as she entered, some looking her up and down, likely thinking she was someone who worked for the charity rather than an honoured guest. Others, however, stared at her knowingly, whispering amongst their friends as she walked through the room.</p><p>Agatha was tempted to get on a chair and announce herself to the room. ‘Yes, tis I! Agatha Harkness. The woman, the myth, the legend.  Feel free to take a photo as I’m never coming to one of these fucking things again.’</p><p>She didn’t though. Instead, she caught sight of her godmother and made a b-line straight towards her.</p><p>“Agatha!” Lilia approached her with open arms. She gave her a hug before kissing both her cheeks. “Oh my dear it’s been too long!”</p><p>It had been a few months since they’d seen each other. Lilia spent a lot of time in her Mediterranean homes these days, and Agatha liked to stay in New York. Her work at Westview University kept her busy most of the year, and she spent her breaks either helping Wanda with the kids, seeing plays with Kingo or heading up to Amherst to lend her expertise to the Emily Dickinson Museum. Not that it stopped Lilia from nagging her to come visit.</p><p>She knew her godmother wanted her to accept her hospitality. To step back into the world she had been born into. Yet Agatha had made the decision long ago that she needed to build her own world. One of old books and faculty meetings, and of people who respected her, rather than treated her like a scandalous oddity.</p><p>“I’m so glad you’re here!” Lilia grinned up at her. “Are you enjoying yourself?”</p><p>“I only just got here, but it looks like you’ve done a good job.”</p><p>“Yes, Stark Industries and F4 inc. have sent advance donations, and we have a lot of deep pockets here for the auction. We even have the head of the Vidal Group here. I think we’re going to have a huge total by the end of the night.”</p><p>“And you’re going to be known as the hostess of the mostess,” Agatha pointed out. She knew her godmother liked to make a splash.</p><p>“That too.” Lilia chuckled, then looked around. “Where’s your friend?”</p><p>“Ill,” Agatha answered. “Or about to be.”</p><p>“Oh that’s a shame. Well, at least that means you can socialise a little. Come over here with me.”</p><p>Lilia led her over to a group of people already in the middle of chattering. Agatha recognised one of them as the Van Dyne’s daughter, and the others as top businesswoman Eleanor Bishop, and Pepper Potts, wife of Tony Stark, who was absent that evening. She could tell because she couldn’t hear his voice; that man was too loud for her liking.</p><p>Eleanor looked her up and down. “Agatha. What a surprise. I thought you didn’t come to these things anymore?”</p><p>“I invited her,” Lilia said proudly. “You all remember each other, right?”</p><p>Eleanor and Pepper nodded stiffly, while little Van Dyne just looked confused.</p><p>Oblivious to the awkwardness, Lilia grinned and clapped her hands. “Very well. I’ll let you catch up!”</p><p>Agatha watched her leave, cursing that her mother had been so devious to give her a rich godmother (she was sure it had been part of a business deal) that actually fucking <em>cared</em> about her.</p><p>“So, Agatha,” Pepper spoke up. “How have you been? What are you up to?”</p><p>“Good, and I’m a professor,” Agatha answered. “Literature.”</p><p>Little Van Dyne seemed interested, and Pepper managed a smile, while Eleanor just scoffed.</p><p>“What university?”</p><p>“Westview,” Agatha answered.</p><p>Little Van Dyne grinned. “I went to Westview! In the science department, but still!”</p><p>Agatha managed to smile back. “Good to see a fellow witch.”</p><p>“Yep, go witches!” Little Van Dyne held out her hand. “I’m Hope.”</p><p>She shook the girl’s hand and offered a small smile. “Agatha. You’re Hank and Janet’s daughter, aren’t you?”</p><p>Hope nodded. “You know them?”</p><p>“Through my mother,” Agatha answered, and she spotted Eleanor smirk into her drink.</p><p>Eleanor had always been a jackass. A judgemental jackass at that. It seemed some things never changed.</p><p>Pepper stepped in to fill the silence one more. “So Agatha, are you…”</p><p>“You’re very brave,” Eleanor cut in. “Coming here tonight.”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“You haven’t been to an event in years,” Eleanor pointed out. “What, do you think enough time has passed that we won’t remember?”</p><p>“I have nothing to be ashamed of,” Agatha said with her head held high. “Never have, never will.”</p><p>Eleanor laughed bitterly. “I see you’re still keeping up that lie.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “And I see you’re still suffering from stupidity, Eleanor.”</p><p>Hope bit back a laugh, while Eleanor’s face went red.</p><p>“Stupidity? How dare you talk to me like that! Do you have any idea who I am?”</p><p>“Unfortunately.”</p><p>“You’re still the same, Harkness. All bark but no substance.”</p><p>“Ladies,” Pepper tried to interject, but Agatha couldn’t not have the last word.</p><p>“At least I don’t need <em>Daddy’s</em> money to make myself matter. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I want to look at the auction pieces.”</p><p>She turned to walk away, only to heard Bishop laugh.</p><p>“As if she can afford anything more than a bag of peanuts.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to turn around and slap that smug smile off that Bishop bitch’s face. But this was Lilia’s night, and she didn’t want to ruin it. So, with all her might, she bit her tongue and stormed off.</p><p>She made it halfway across the room before a firm body bumped into hers. Agatha caught herself from stumbling and quickly whirled to face whatever <em>idiot</em> got in her way.</p><p>Said idiot was a pretty brunette, wearing a simple black velvet dress and small hooped earrings. Likely a date of some wall street guy, or a company representative. Whoever she was, she stared back at her with big brown eyes wide and startled. In her irritable state, Agatha found it incredibly annoying.</p><p>“Watch where you’re going,” she snapped, before charging towards the bar. She needed a drink, probably two…or five.</p><p> </p><p>Rio followed her to the bar, keeping her distance but always keeping her in sight. And what a sight she was. Beautiful brown draping over her one shoulder in loose curls, the small straps of her dress revealing an exquisite expanse of skin, along with the most teasing hint of cleavage. And her legs…it took everything for her not to stare. Yet what she wanted to see most was those piercing blue eyes, and to hear that voice again, rich and sharp. She wanted it all.</p><p>Pushing down her nerves, Rio walked confidently to the bar, saddling up beside her. “Hey.”</p><p>The woman looked up, her jaw quickly tightening. “If you’re here for an argument, I must warn you my bite<em> is</em> just as bad as my bark.”</p><p>Rio had a feeling that last part had nothing to do with her, and rather whatever had made her storm around the room at top speed. “No, I wanted to get you a drink.”</p><p>“It’s an open bar,” Agatha snapped.</p><p>“Not everything is free.” Rio waved down the bartender. “Two glasses of your finest. You know what.”</p><p>The bartender nodded and headed into the back, returning with a champagne bucket and two glasses. “Enjoy ladies.”</p><p>“Excellent,” Rio smiled. “Put it on my tab.”</p><p>The bartender nodded. Everyone knew she’d make good on it. A Vidal always paid their debts.</p><p>“What is that?”</p><p>“Bollinger.” Rio examined the bottle and nodded in approval. “Not a bad vintage for a commercial bar.”</p><p>She poured them both a glass, before pushing one across the bar to her compelling companion.</p><p>The woman stared at the glass, before picking it up and taking an experimental sip. Her eyebrows shot up. “Wow, that’s…that’s good champagne.”</p><p>Rio grinned and held out her hand. “I’m Rio.”</p><p>The woman looked her up and down with pursed lips before shaking her hand firmly. Rio relished the touch, so warm and soft. She swore she would worship those hands, along with the rest of her.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha,</em>” Rio tasted the name on her tongue, and found it finer than champagne could ever be. “I like it.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Apologies for walking into you. However I must admit, I’m glad I did.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows again. “You are?”</p><p>“I am. I hope this doesn’t sound too forward but I…I’ve been waiting to meet you for some time.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a moment before shooting her a deep glare. “Is this a joke or something?”</p><p>“What?” Rio frowned. “No, not at all. Why would you think I’d be joking?”</p><p>“Don’t lie,” Agatha sneered. “I know you all find it funny, but I don’t need some second-rate date playing silly games to win brownie points with their asshole friends.”</p><p>“What? Agatha I-”</p><p>“Just leave me alone.” Agatha went to leave, only to turn back and grab the champagne bottle, stomping off with it grasped at the neck.</p><p>Rio watched her go in awe. That wasn’t a woman. That was a certified goddess.</p><p>“Rio?” Alice’s voice came from behind her.</p><p>“Hey Al.” She sensed her move to stand beside her, but Rio couldn’t take her eyes off the sharp red merging into the crowd.</p><p>Alice must have followed her gaze. “Who was that?”</p><p>Rio smiled in wonder. “My future wife.”</p><p align="center">-</p><p>Rio’s father had told her a story long ago. Of how by living generously and kindly, their family had been blessed with three gifts. The first was sharp minds, curious and contemplating. The second: hearts big enough to love and care about not only their inner circle, but anyone in need of their help and hospitality. The third was a more personal gift, a reward her father called it. The gift of knowing your soulmate at a single glance.</p><p>‘You’ll know, <em>mi flor,</em>’ he’d told her. ‘The moment you seem them, you’ll know.’</p><p>She trusted her father’s words, as she always had, but with age and experience, Rio wasn’t sure what that would feel like. How would she know for sure? Would she just have to take it with blind faith? Had it already happened? Had missed it because she wasn’t sure?</p><p>Then she saw <em>her</em>, and suddenly she understood.</p><p>“Rio, please just think about this,” Alice begged as she chased after her. “You don’t know her.”</p><p>Rio weaved through the crowd, desperate to find her again. That beautiful woman in the red dress.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>The most beautiful name to go with the most compelling person she had ever met.</p><p>“Rio, stop.” Alice grasped her arm, making her stop. “Just take a minute, please!”</p><p>“I can’t, Alice. I’m telling you. She’s her!”</p><p>“Alright, but just think about this rationally, okay,” Alice pleaded. “She doesn’t know you. You can’t just bulldoze your way into her life. You need to get to know her first at least.”</p><p>Rio knew she was right, even if she hated it. “Fine.”</p><p>“Right, so what’s her name?”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>“Agatha what?”</p><p>“No idea.”</p><p>“You’re declaring she’s the love of your life and you don’t know her last name?”</p><p>Rio nodded.</p><p>Alice sighed. “Alright, come with me.”</p><p>Rio followed Alice through the crowd to the auction lot table. There, she spotted the unmistakable figure of Jennifer Kale and stopped in her tracks.</p><p>“Why are you taking me to see your booty call?”</p><p>“She’s not my booty call,” Alice hissed, and Rio snickered.</p><p>“No, you’re hers.”</p><p>“Look, Jen knows everyone. We can ask her if she knows an Agatha here tonight.”</p><p>Suddenly, Rio was ahead of her. “Hey Jen.”</p><p>Jen turned to face them, dressed in an elegant evening gown that would have made Princess Diana jealous. “Rio, Alice. To what do I owe the pleasure?”</p><p>“Do you know someone here called Agatha?” Alice asked. “Brown hair, red dress…”</p><p>“Gorgeous,” Rio added, earning a look from her friend.</p><p>“I don’t know a…Wait, do you mean Agatha <em>Harkness?”</em></p><p>Rio shrugged. “I didn’t catch a last name.”</p><p>“Was she snappy and kind of mean?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Rio grinned.</p><p>Jen sighed. “I know Agatha. She went to the same boarding school as me, but the year above. She was pretty infamous.”</p><p>“She was?” Rio wanted to know everything.</p><p>“She transferred during freshman year,” Jen explained. “The school went from middle school right up, but it wasn’t strange for people to just come for middle school or high school. I remember when she came though. It was chaos.”</p><p>“How so?” Rio pressed.</p><p>“Her mom died, and I guess the family estate sent her there to get her out of the way, which she wasn’t too happy about. She’d set fire to bins, throw things in the swimming pool, and who knows how many girls she got caught kissing in the cupboard at the back of the science lab. She almost got expelled three times, but she stayed for about a year before she left.”</p><p>“Why did she leave?”</p><p>“Her godmother took over custody. You know Lilia Calderu, right?”</p><p>Rio nodded. She had met her in passing a number of times.</p><p>“Well, she took her to Europe,” Jen explained. “Bounced around all these fancy schools before getting into Oxford.”</p><p>“So she’s smart,” Rio noted approvingly.</p><p>“Too smart,” Jen added. “She doesn’t have money. As far as I know, she was uninherited in her mom’s will, and Lilia paid for most of her education. Last I heard, she was a lit professor at Westview.”</p><p>Rio made mental notes of all of this.</p><p>“Is she married?” Alice asked, stealing a cautious glance Jen’s way. “Partner? Kids? Anything like that?”</p><p>Dread filled Rio’s stomach. That possibility hadn’t entered her head. Had the love of her life already met someone? Was she now forever cursed with wanting someone she could never have? To live alone forever. An hour ago, the thought of being a bachelor for life didn’t bother her. Now it made her want to cry.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Jen admitted. “She doesn’t socialise in our circles anymore. She’s only here because Lilia organised the benefit.”</p><p>“Will you speak to her?” Rio asked hopefully. “To find out if she’s…if she’s unattached?”</p><p>Jen’s eyes narrowed. “Really? Agatha?”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>Jen folded her warms. “What do I get out of this?”</p><p>“What do you want?” Rio was getting ready to give Jen one of her hotels she was that desperate.</p><p>“An invite on your yacht, preferably somewhere nice.”</p><p>Rio held out her hand. “Deal.”</p><p>Jen shook her hand before waving them off. “I’ll be back with the intel soon.”</p><p>Rio looked to Alice, catching her biting her lip as she watched Jen go.</p><p>“You’ve got it bad.”</p><p>“I know,” Alice said with a dramatic sigh. “At least my girl knows I exist though.”</p><p>“Hey, mine does too!”</p><p>“But does she know who you really are, Miss Vidal?” Alice questioned.</p><p>“Not yet,” Rio answered, though she was sure that would soon change.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had found a lonely table for her and her champagne and was enjoying her second glass when a familiar face came to ruin the ambiance.</p><p>“Agatha! It’s been so long!”</p><p>“Well, if it isn’t my least favourite vegetable,” Agatha sassed. “What do you want, Kale?”</p><p>Jennifer Kale sat down in the seat opposite her and picked up one of the wine glasses from the table. She helped herself to some of the champagne.</p><p>“Hey!”</p><p>“You didn’t buy it,” Jen argued. “It’s a thousand dollars a bottle.”</p><p>Agatha tried to hide her surprise by taking a long sip. “How do you know I didn’t splash out?”</p><p>“You’re on an academic’s salary, and the rest of the bar is free.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t understand why that Rio woman had wasted all that money on her, though she knew the type. Money was no matter so they just threw it around, while others scrapped for every last dollar. She herself had been lucky not to have gotten to that point, but living on her salary did not grant the luxuries of her childhood. The freedom she found, however, was priceless.</p><p>“So what’s new with you?” Jen asked. “Married? Kids?”</p><p>She couldn’t help but laugh. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Oh come on,” Jen pressed. “There must be someone.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I like being on my own.”</p><p>“Right…still a lesbian then?”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms. “Are you coming on to me, Kale?”</p><p>“WHAT? No! I mean you’re very…I just…” Jen sighed. “Sorry. I’ll leave you alone.”</p><p>She went to go, but Agatha stopped her. “Wait.”</p><p>Jen froze.</p><p>“What’s going on? Is it some kind of game? You all buy me expensive drinks and ask me stupid questions to what? Laugh about me behind my back?!”</p><p>“No one is making fun of you,” Jen insisted. “You’re being paranoid.”</p><p>“Paranoid? Oh I’ll show you-”</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>She looked round to see Lilia rushing towards her. Jen seemed to take the opportunity and disappeared into the crowd, leaving Agatha even more frustrated than before.</p><p>“Agatha, thank goodness,” Lilia said when she reached her. “I have a huge favour to ask.”</p><p>She sighed. “What?”</p><p>“Nothing big! It’s just one of the special guests who agreed to part of the auction had to cancel. Traffic issues, apparently.”</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>“I need you to take their place.”</p><p>She didn’t like the sound of that. “Doing what?”</p><p>“Well, you’ll come on stage, and we’d auction off…a meal with you.”</p><p>“No. Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“You’re auctioning me off to go on a date with some rich prick!”</p><p>“I’ll win the bid,” Lilia promised. “We just need to fill the docket, okay? Everyone will be bidding on the yacht anyway. Please, dear. For me?”</p><p>Agatha tried to stay strong, but eventually she crumbled. “Fine, but I still don’t like it.”</p><p>“Thank you, my dear.” Lilia leaned up and kissed her cheek. “Now come with me. The auction is about to start!”</p><p> </p><p>The auction was set to begin and Rio found her and Alice a table to one side. She looked over the auction brochure and made a mental note of where she could give. Most would be after the grand yacht at the end, but Rio was thinking more on the smaller side.</p><p>“I like the look of that Gibson,” Alice admitted, pointing to where the guitat was displayed at the side of the stage.”</p><p>“I’ll bid for you,” Rio suggested. “I plan on spending tonight.”</p><p>It was that moment Jen appeared, taking a seat beside Alice. “You guys got some good seats.”</p><p>“It’s strategic,” Rio told her. “Most people go for the middle, but it’s really the wings that offer the best experience.”</p><p>“Can you tell she’s a hotelier?” Alice asked Jen, who chuckled.</p><p>“Can’t knock her. I stayed in a Vidal Hotel when I went to Sydney. It was very impressive.”</p><p>“Oh I love that one!” Alice gasped. “The one with the giant fish tank?”</p><p>“That’s it!”</p><p>“They’re all rescue fish,” Alice explained. “Rio even built a sea-life rehabilitation unit on site. I told her she should convert some of the lobby into an aquarium, but she won’t listen to me.”</p><p>“I don’t need an aquarium,” Rio insisted. “The big tank is enough. Anyway, enough about the fish. Did you speak to Agatha?”</p><p>“I did,” Jen confirmed. “She totally thinks I’m trying to get into her pants, but she is indeed single.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but grin, but Jen held up her hand.</p><p>“Not so fast, Romeo. She’s also got it in her head that we’re messing with her.”</p><p>“What?” Rio frowned. “Why?”</p><p>“Because from what I’ve just heard, she had a bit of back forth with Eleanor Bishop which has set her on edge. Apparently, Bishop said she was too poor to bid on a pack of peanuts.”</p><p>Rio took a sip of her drink, clutching the glass so tight she was surprised it didn’t. How she couldn’t wait to wipe the floor with anyone who even looked sourly in Agatha’s direction.</p><p>The auction soon started, and as the dockets went on, Rio managed to get Alice the Gibson, and she scored herself some courtside WNBA season tickets. Her intention was to leave it at that, perhaps pick up anything if the bids were low so the charity got a bit more. Yet as things stood, she was more than satisfied with her haul for the evening, though she wasn’t completely happy.</p><p>She couldn’t see Agatha in the crowd. Not even the slightest glimpse of red. Rio hoped she hadn’t gone home. She couldn’t just find her only to have her disappear.</p><p>“Now,” the auctioneer began again. “Docket Number 12 has had a slight change from the brochure, but I’m sure you’ll all still be interested. A dinner for two at Le Bernardin tomorrow evening, all expenses paid. Only now you will have company of the lovely Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>Rio sat up in her seat and watched as Agatha stepped out onto the stage. Her body language was stiff, but she still looked breathtaking. She reached for her paddle, but Alice leaned over to stop her.</p><p>“Rio, you can’t buy a date with her.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because it would be fucking weird.”</p><p>Rio brought her hand back but still sat at attention.</p><p>“Without further ado,” the auctioneer continued, “I’ll start the bidding at $100.”</p><p>A paddle went up. “$200.”</p><p>“That’s Lilia,” Jen whispered. “I bet it’s a set up.”</p><p>“$200,” another voice called out, this time a man’s. Rio craned her neck to see, only to grimace. It was Ralph Bohner, Wall Street asshole.</p><p>“$300,” Lilia called out.</p><p>“$1,000,” Ralph countered.</p><p>“$1,500,” Lilia added.</p><p>Ralph stood from his seat this time, straightening his suit jacket before holding up his paddle. “$100,000.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, who was signing something in Lilia’s direction. Eventually, the paddle went up.</p><p>“$100,500.”</p><p>Ralph laughed and held up his paddle again. “$250,000.”</p><p>“He really likes her, huh,” Alice commented.</p><p>“He always has,” Jen supplied. “He just doesn’t get the message. Now the poor girl is going to be stuck with that creep all night.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, who was gesturing aggressively at Lilia, but no paddle went up.</p><p>“$250,000 going once,” the auctioneer called.</p><p>Rio looked at her paddle.</p><p>“Going twice!”</p><p>“Sorry Alice,” she whispered, before grabbing her paddle and jumping to her feet. “$45 million.”</p><p>A loud gasp circled the room as chairs shifted and heads turned, all wanting to take a look at the big bidder. Agatha looked to be in equal shock, her mouth hanging open comically. Rio found it adorable.</p><p>“Sorry,” the auctioneer spoke up. “Did you say forty-five <em>million</em>?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio confirmed, looking to were Ralph Bohner still stood, shoulders slumped, and face filled with disappointment, “and I will go higher if Mr Bohner wishes to challenge.”</p><p>Ralph shot her a glare before dropping down in his seat.</p><p>“Forty-five million going once!”</p><p>No one challenged.</p><p>“Going twice.” The hammer came down. “Sold, to Miss Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“You’re a fucking idiot,” Alice told her, but Rio just winked and headed up to get her prize.</p><p>She shook the auctioneer’s hand and collected the documentation for the reservation, before moving to stand beside Agatha for a photograph.</p><p>“What was that?” Agatha asked under her breath as they smiled for the camera.</p><p>“I wasn’t going to let you go for dinner with that sleaze,” Rio answered. “And I do like the desserts at Le Bernardin.”</p><p>“Why did you bid that much though?” Agatha demanded. “The yacht isn’t even worth that.”</p><p>The photographer moved on, and Rio gently took Agatha’s hand. “The yacht is all well and good, but you, my love,” she placed a kiss to her knuckles, “are priceless.”</p><p>She walked back to her table, clutching the envelope in her hand while the warmth of Agatha’s skin still tingled her lips.</p><p>When she reached Alice and Jen, they both looked up at her with arms folded. Jen’s face was lightened with amusement, but Alice looked like she was going to bonk her on the head.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked as she dropped back into her seat. “It’s for the kids!”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio got up as she did every morning. She woke up bright and early and headed to her workout room to do her usual morning miles on the treadmill, before taking a quick shower and making herself some breakfast.</p><p>Her New York penthouse took up an entire upper floor of a modern high-rise overlooking Central Park. Alice had asked why she didn’t just stay in one of her hotels. After all, she had two right there in Manhattan. Yet Rio had always liked to have her own space in places she visited often. Currently, she had a townhouse in London, a house in the south of France, smaller properties scattered across the Greek islands, and a summer villa on Lake Como. Most she had inherited, while others she had simply fallen in love with.</p><p>While her strikingly modern New York apartment was more for convenience than homeliness, she did enjoy standing by the windows with her morning coffee for some quiet moments of contemplation. Most of the time her mind was on work, friends, the general sorry state of the world. That morning however, there was only one thing on her mind. Something, or rather someone, who had consumed her entire being from the moment their eyes met.</p><p>Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Rio could help but smile at the thought of her. At her beautiful face, her sharp tongue, her smooth voice, those blue eyes that reminded her of a glistening ocean. She had always wondered what her future wife would be like, yet now she’d seen her, it could never have been anyone else.</p><p>Once her coffee was done, she headed to her bedroom. She pulled out the outfit she had already selected in her mind to wear that evening and laid it all out on the bed. It wasn’t too formal or too flirtatious but was smart and showed an effort had been made. The dinner was about getting to know each other, setting down the foundations of a friendship, or at least an acquaintanceship. After all, she was playing the long game.</p><p>As she changed into one of her business suits ready for a meeting uptown, her phone rang. When she saw the ID, she quickly answered and stuck it on speakerphone.</p><p>“Alice!” Rio greeted as she continued buttoning up her shirt. “How are you this beautiful morning?”</p><p>Her friend’s laughter filtered through the phone. “<em>You’re in a good mood. Has it got anything to do with a certain reservation at Le Bernardin tonight?”</em></p><p>Rio grinned. “Perhaps.”</p><p>
<em>“I still can’t believe you did that. Why can’t you just ask a girl out on a date like a normal person?”</em>
</p><p>“It’s not a date,” Rio insisted. “It’s just dinner. I want things to grow between us naturally.”</p><p>
<em>“Yes, because nothing says ‘naturally’ like paying millions to go out with her.”</em>
</p><p>“For the last time, it was for charity!”</p><p>
<em>“Whatever. I just called to wish you good luck and just...keep it cool, okay? And don’t throw your money around. No expensive gifts or anything?”</em>
</p><p>“So no Cartier?”</p><p>
<em>“Rio...”</em>
</p><p>“I’m joking!” Kind of, anyway. “Thanks, though. I’ll call you when I get back.”</p><p>
<em>“Please do! This is the most interesting thing that’s happened to either of us in ages!”</em>
</p><p>“Are you saying we’re boring?”</p><p>
<em>“As boring as a hotelier and a rockstar can be.”</em>
</p><p>Once the call ended, Rio looked to her dinner outfit once more. This night was going to be one of the most important of her life, and she could hardly wait.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha just wanted to get the entire day over with. Her morning classes had annoyed her, she had her office hour that afternoon which consisted of stupid questions, stupid ideas, and just general stupidity, and then she had that damn dinner with a woman who clearly had more money than sense.</p><p>At least Wanda had made it into work, so she had been saved from the hells of teaching Shakespeare. And she had someone sane to talk with at lunch.</p><p>“Vision took the boys to that diner even after I told him not too,” Wanda huffed as she jabbed her fork into her salad. “And hey presto- food poisoning!”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Well at least it taught him a lesson, but I do feel for the boys.”</p><p>“They seem okay now, but I kept them off school for the day. Vision wanted me to stay and help with them, but I knew if I did, I’d say something I’d regret.”</p><p>“He still on the couch?”</p><p>“Yep, and that’s where he’ll be staying.” Wanda then put on a smile. “So how did last night go?”</p><p>Agatha made a sound of disgust and Wanda chuckled. </p><p>“That bad?”</p><p>“You wouldn’t believe it.”</p><p>“Tell me everything!”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “One of the dinner- date prizes at the auction cried off so Lilia made me take their place.”</p><p>“Oh God, what happened?”</p><p>“Lilia said she’d win me and we’d have a nice dinner, which I was fine with. And it was going well until Ralph Bohner started bidding away.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened. “Is he the guy who wouldn’t stop sending you flowers?”</p><p>“And chocolate. And cheap jewellery. Anyway, he kept bidding and bidding, to the point Lilia couldn’t go any higher.”</p><p>“Oh no!” Wanda covered her mouth. “Please say you’re not going on a date with him!”</p><p>“Nope, because just as he was about to win, someone overtook him. So now, I’m having dinner with a millionaire tonight.”</p><p>“Shit.” Wanda leaned back in her seat. “So, you’re going out with some random guy?”</p><p>“Random woman,” Agatha corrected.</p><p>“Is she hot?”</p><p>“<em>Wanda,</em> that’s not the <em>point</em>. The point is that I’m going out for dinner with a complete stranger.”</p><p>“Isn’t that just like most first dates?”</p><p>“Woah, who’s going on a date?” Kingo slid down beside them in one of his usual dapper outfits, a fruit smoothie in his hand. “You know I don’t appreciate you gossiping without me, ladies.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but Wanda was all too happy to catch him up.</p><p>“Agatha has a date with a rich lady.”</p><p>“It’s not a date,” Agatha insisted. “It’s dinner. A dinner she won in a stupid charity auction at a stupid benefit run my stupid godmother who I’ll never speak to <em>again</em>.”</p><p>“That sounds like a meet cute if ever I heard one.” Kingo wiggled his eyebrows. “Is she hot?”</p><p>Agatha once again ignored the question.</p><p>“I’ll take that as a yes,” Kingo said with a grin. “So how much did she bid on you?”</p><p>“Forty-five,” Agatha answered.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened. “Thousand?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Million.”</p><p>“Fuck!” Kingo gasped. “I mean…Agatha, that’s like…I’m lost for words.”</p><p>“And you don’t know this woman?” Wanda questioned. “At all?”</p><p>“No, I mean I spoke to her earlier in the night. She bought me a bottle of champagne, but I thought she was one of the gossipy wives trying to play a trick on me. I didn’t know she was <em>rich </em>rich.”</p><p>“She bought you champagne too?” Kingo snickered. “Oh, she <em>likes</em> you, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha scowled and swatted his arm.</p><p>“Do you know her name?” Wanda asked.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Agatha answered with disgust. “Lilia has assured me she’s nice enough.”</p><p>“Rio Vidal?” Kingo questioned. “Like the Vidal hotels?”</p><p>“I guess?”</p><p>He quickly reached for his phone and tapped away at the screen. “It says here she’s the owner, chairmen and president of the Vidal Group, her family company.”</p><p>Wanda leaned over. “Are there any pictures?”</p><p>“Oh yeah,” Kingo grinned, showing her the screen.</p><p>“Agatha, she’s gorgeous!” Wanda gasped. “You have to date her!”</p><p>“I’m not dating anyone,” Agatha huffed. “Especially not a ridiculous heiress.”</p><p>“Yeah, yeah, yeah,” Kingo teased. “I bet you’ll be married by the end of summer.”</p><p>She shot him a glare and stole his smoothie. They were both foolishly wrong. She would make sure Rio Vidal left restaurant knowing she wasted her time and money, because Agatha was totally not interested.</p><p> </p><p>Rio stood anxiously outside of the restaurant. Their reservation was at seven, but she had arrived twenty minutes early to make sure Agatha wasn’t waiting for her. Yet it was five minutes to seven, and her dinner companion was nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Had Agatha decided not to come? Had something happened? Was she okay?</p><p>She sucked in a sharp breath, trying to keep her worries at bay. This was fated somehow, and it would all work out. Like it had for every Vidal before her. Though none were likely as fiery and formidable as Agatha Harkness.</p><p>A cab pulled up and the passenger door flew opened, a familiar voice meeting her ears like a bird song. A very irritated bird song.</p><p>“…and if you think I’m leaving you a good review, you have another thing coming!”</p><p>Rio tried to supress the grin that pulled at her lips as Agatha appeared, dressed in yet another red dress. This one more casual, a summer dress that flowed lightly in the breeze, an oversized blazer covering up from the slight chill in the April air.</p><p>She watched her date slam the car door shut with a huff, before turning to face her. When their eyes met, she felt Agatha’s eyes pulling her apart. She had put on her best social wear: her leather pants, a maroon silk shirt with a grey blazer thrown over the top.</p><p>“Wow,” Agatha commented. “You almost look like a normal person.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “And you look extraordinary. Now, shall we head inside?”</p><p>They headed in and handed the reservation documents to the hostess, who showed them to their table. Rio had always enjoyed the ambiance Le Bernardin, though it was never her place of choice. Though perhaps after this, it would become her favourite place in the world.</p><p>“Champagne for the table?” the hostess asked when they were seated, and Rio looked to Agatha questioningly, who shrugged.</p><p>“When in Rome?”</p><p>The hostess quickly returned with two glass flutes and a bottle on ice. Rio poured for them both, before joining Agatha in perusing the menu.</p><p>She was acutely aware they had barely spoken, not even small talk, and with every passing moment, it got harder to come up with something say. Eventually, she kicked herself enough to take the plunge.</p><p>“What are you thinking for your first course?”</p><p>“Caviar,” Agatha answered. “I don’t have it often, obviously.”</p><p>Rio nodded. She didn’t like caviar. Truthfully, she didn’t eat a lot of meats or fish. Her love for the natural world meant she loved every living thing, and she hated the thought of something suffering for the sake of her own pleasure. Hence why she didn’t like caviar.</p><p>“I’m thinking the salad.”</p><p>“Boring,” Agatha commented, and Rio couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“Guilty as charged.” She looked up at Agatha. “How was your day?”</p><p>“My day?” Agatha questioned. “Fine. How was yours?”</p><p>“Much better now,” Rio answered with a smile. “Jen told me you’re a professor.”</p><p>“Jen has a big mouth.” Agatha took a sip of her champagne. “I teach English.”</p><p>“Do you enjoy it?”</p><p>“I enjoy the research and the discussions. Sometimes it feels like a lot of it falls on deaf ears, but at least I have my postgraduate students to keep me sane.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding. “I ended up doing mostly business and science classes in college. Though I often ended up daydreaming instead of listening. I still do in boring meetings.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a tight smile before looking down at her menu again. Rio thought frantically for something else to say. Something to continue the conversation.</p><p>“What do you want for your second course?”</p><p>Agatha slammed her menu shut. “Okay, what’s going on?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Why are we here, Rio?” Agatha demanded. “Why did you bid that much on me?”</p><p>“Because I wanted to have dinner with you,” Rio answered without hesitation.</p><p>“Why? I’m not that special.”</p><p>The words stung Rio’s heart. “Of course you are.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a moment before shaking her head. “Whatever. It’s your money to waste.”</p><p>“I’m not wasting it,” Rio insisted. “Even if we just sit here in silence, I’d say it was worth it.”</p><p>“For the food?”</p><p>“I don’t really like seafood.”</p><p>“You don’t like seafood?”</p><p>Rio shook her head.</p><p>“Then why did you want to come here?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “You’re here.”</p><p>Agatha looked deep in contemplation for a moment before eyeing her suspiciously. “So the bid was about me, not the dinner?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I’d have paid the same to share a pizza at a hole in the wall.”</p><p>Agatha laughed and shook her head. “Wow. Okay.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Rio looked down at her lap. “Alice told me to play it cool, but I’m not good at that.”</p><p>She heard Agatha sigh. “Drink up, Vidal. Let’s go.”</p><p>Rio’s head shot up. “You’re going?”</p><p>“We’re going,” Agatha clarified. “You paid this much for my company, so let’s take my company elsewhere. Preferably somewhere that has proper portion sizes.”</p><p>“What about your caviar?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I’ll get Lilia to buy me some. She owes me, after all.”</p><p>They downed their drinks, before standing to put on their coats. As she did, Rio spotted a couple in the corner of the restaurant, dressed in their best clothes and looking at the menu with lost expressions on their faces. She waved down one of the waiters and asked them to put the meal experience onto their tab instead, giving them a couple of hundreds for the trouble.</p><p>Once it was sorted, Rio held her arm out to Agatha with a bright smile. “What do you fancy, Miss Harkness?”</p><p>Agatha linked their arms together with a smirk “Now you mention it, I’d love a good pizza.”</p><p>Rio chucked as she led them out of the restaurant. “Your wish is my command, my lady.”</p><p> </p><p>They found a little pizzeria a few blocks away, and Agatha had to say she was a little relieved. Here she would have equal footing, even if Rio was still the one paying.</p><p>Rio went up to the counter and ordered them a cheese pizza to share, before joining her back at their table. “Are you sure this is okay?”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha insisted. “So, what’s the deal? Are you vegan or…”</p><p>Rio laughed softly. “No, I just prefer fish when they’re living.”</p><p>“Right.” Agatha knew rich people could be eccentric, her godmother was living proof, but Rio Vidal was something else. “Rio, this isn’t a date to you, is it?”</p><p>“No. Just dinner.”</p><p>Agatha relaxed. “Good, because I need tell you, I’m not interested in getting back into that old money scene again. I like my life the way it is, and I’m not uprooting it for anyone. No exceptions”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Anyone who asks you to do that clearly doesn’t care about you, Agatha.”</p><p>“So if we dated you would happily stay over in my one-bedroom apartment with crap air conditioning and a nice view of a side alley?”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because you probably live in a luxury penthouse with a view to die for.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Okay guilty.”</p><p>“Have I disappointed you?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Who’s your favourite writer?”</p><p>Agatha blinked in surprise before answering.  “Emily Dickinson. I’m considered an expert on her, actually.” </p><p>“Really?” Rio propped up her head with her hands. “Tell me more?”</p><p>Agatha waved her off. “You don’t want to hear all that. It’ll take us all night.”</p><p>Rio just smiled. “I have all the time in the world.”</p><p>They ate their pizza as Agatha talked, telling Rio of how she found Dickinson as a pre-teen and had memorized most of work by the time she was fifteen. How she had based her dissertation on her work during her last year at Oxford, and had explained her research, essays, and her work with the Emily Dickinson Museum.</p><p>Rio asked questions from time to time and laughed when she threw in a joke, but mostly she listened. Really listened. Like she was the most fascinating thing in the world. </p><p>By the time they’d finished, it was getting late and the staff looked to be getting agitated. </p><p>“My driver will pick us up,” Rio told her. “We’ll drop you back at your apartment.”</p><p>“I can get an Uber,” Agatha insisted, remembering she needed to give her ride there a one-star review. That ignorant jerk.</p><p>“I’d rather make sure you got home safe,” Rio insisted, and who was Agatha to refuse a free ride?</p><p>The free ride in question was a stylish black Range Rover, with smooth leather seats and that fresh new car smell still strong in the interior.  Rio helped Agatha into the back before sliding in next to her. “Hey Dave, can you take Agatha home first?”</p><p>“Sure thing, boss,” he replied, and Agatha quickly whittled off her address.</p><p>“That’s close to your campus,” Rio commented, and Agatha shrugged. </p><p>“It’s convenient.” </p><p>Rio nodded in agreement. “Can we meet up again? Maybe for coffee? Just coffee. As friends?”</p><p>Agatha wasn’t stupid. She knew Rio didn’t want to be just friends. Yet she had begrudgingly enjoyed her evening, and the thought of seeing her again wasn’t entirely horrible. </p><p>“Maybe. I’m busy with classes and my research, so I’ll need to look at my schedule.”</p><p>“Can I have your number then?” Rio asked hopefully. “Or you can have mine. Whichever you prefer.”</p><p>Agatha bit back a smile. Rio’s eagerness was starting to grow on her. “Fine, but get ready because I’m only giving it once.”</p><p>Rio’s driver was very efficient and got her home pretty swiftly. She noticed Rio peering up at her building and wondered what it looked like in the eyes of a multi-millionaire.</p><p>“Thanks for dinner,” she quipped. “Hope it was worth the GDP of a small country.”</p><p>“It most definitely was,” Rio said with a grin. “I’d like it if I saw you for the price of a coffee next time though.”</p><p>Rio’s driver got out and opened the door for her, and Agatha was a little sad she had to go.</p><p>“Well, let’s talk about that coffee,” she said as she climbed out of the car. </p><p>“Or just talk?” Rio asked. “You know, in general?”</p><p>“Goodnight Rio.”</p><p>“Goodnight Agatha.”</p><p>Rio’s driver shut the door between them and offered her a nod before climbing back into the front seat. She watched the car drive off, then headed up to her apartment</p><p>When she got inside, she flopped onto her couch and checked the notifications on her phone, finding one from Wanda.</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>How was it?</em>
</p><p>She considered her answer before replying:</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Interesting.</em>
</p><p>Wanda replied quickly. </p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Good interesting or bad interesting?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Just interesting. </em>
</p><p>Then another message came through, one from an unrecognized number. </p><p>
<em>so…coffee?</em>
</p><p>Then another came through.</p><p>
<em>this is rio btw</em>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, before saving the contact under <strong>RICH LOSER </strong>and setting her phone down on the couch beside her.</p><p>What the hell had she gotten herself into? </p>

</p><p>
<em>i’m having her flown out next week.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>All those carbon emissions for one little spider…so you’re staying in New York for a while then?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>i didn’t intend to, but it seems i have a lot of business to take care of.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Business huh? </em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>yes it’s making me particularly parched today…want to go join me for coffee?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Can’t. I’m making essays.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>maybe another time?</em>
</p><p><em> </em> <strong>AGATHA</strong></p><p>
<em>Yeah maybe.</em>
</p><p>Agatha never said no. That was the worst part. She just pushed it on to another time, and Rio held on to the hope that the next time she asked, it would be a definitive yes.</p><p>Work was a good distraction: they were in the process of buying a building in Rome, a former grand mansion that had been renovated into a hotel, only to fall into disrepair due to neglect and financial strain. Rio saw the potential and had a plan to return the hotel to its rightful grandeur.</p><p>They were set to close the sale by the end of the week, and her legal team were ready to submit plans and permissions to get the project running. She was excited, certainly, but it wasn’t with her usual ambition. No, she was excited because she could imagine visiting with Agatha. Perhaps she and Agatha could spend the summer at her villa and travel to Rome to oversee the project. Rio figured she’d have seen all the sights before, as she herself also had, but the thought of wandering the streets together eating gelatos before going to drink champagne on a rooftop balcony…oh she hoped to make that a reality.</p><p>In the meantime, she needed to work out how to get Agatha to agree to coffee, and blow off some steam. So she closed the VIP tennis court at her 5<sup>th</sup> Avenue hotel and called the one friend she knew would give her the challenge she needed.</p><p>“You’re good, Vidal,” Carol Danvers called across the court as Rio managed to score another point. “What’s that now?”</p><p>“4-5 to me,” Rio answered. “Need a breather?”</p><p>Carol shook her head. “Let’s finish this game first.”</p><p>They played on. Carol was a good player, though she hadn’t spent her childhood bouncing around luxury hotels. Rio was skilled at tennis, golf, swimming, diving, surfing, skiing, and she wasn’t too bad at basketball either. The prose of homeschooling and lots of downtime.</p><p>Carol had been born like her, with a silver spoon in her mouth, but had spat it out as soon as she was able. Her father died when she was a teenager, and she had sold off all the Danvers oil fields and casinos to focus on her true passion: aviation.  By 2035, Carol hoped to have a line of commercial jets powered solely by renewable and clean energy sources, a cause Rio was very supportive of. In the meantime, she was designing cars using similar methods, in the hopes it will encourage further development in the field.</p><p>As impressive as she was, however, it didn’t stop Rio from winning the game.</p><p>Carol chuckled as they walked to their water bottles. “So, I heard you bought yourself a date the other night?”</p><p>“I saved her from dating a douchebag,” Rio corrected, at which Carol gasped dramatically.</p><p>“Oh Rio, my white knight, how valiant you are!”</p><p>“It wasn’t like that,” Rio insisted. “She’s…you remember when I told you that story about my family. How everyone knows the person they’ll marry the moment they see them.”</p><p>Carol rolled her eyes. “Not that love at first sight bullshit again.”</p><p>“It’s not love at first sight,” Rio huffed. “Its like, I don’t know, everything clicks into place. You know why no one else ever stood a chance because it was always meant to be them, and now you know it could never be anyone else <em>but</em> them.”</p><p>“Right…” Carol wiped down her face with her towel. “That’s oddly specific…”</p><p>Rio nodded. “It is.”</p><p>Carol stared at her for a moment before her eyes widened. “Fuck off!”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You’ve been spending too much time with Valkyrie.”</p><p>“No, no, we’re not talking about my messy love life! She’s your soulmate!”</p><p>“It’s not-”</p><p>“Stop, just let us talk about this, okay?” Carol grinned from ear to ear. “I can’t believe it actually happened!”</p><p>“Me neither,” Rio admitted. “I was starting to be a bit dubious of it all, but then I saw her and it’s like somehow this person I just met has become the entire centre of my life.”</p><p>“So you met her at the benefit?”</p><p>Rio told her the whole story. From bumping into each other, to the champagne, to the bidding war, to the dinner, and the conversations that followed. Carol, unable to contain herself, interrupted more times than she could count, but Rio didn’t mind. It was good to talk about it with someone other than Alice, who had told her twice in the last couple of days to stop being such a ‘simp’.</p><p>“Dude,” Carol said when the story was done. “You can’t fuck around with this. You gotta make a big gesture.”</p><p>“Like what?” Rio asked.</p><p>“Get her something nice like flowers or jewellery. Show her how serious you are.”</p><p>Rio considered it with a frown. “Wouldn’t that be a bit too forward?”</p><p>“You’ve got to let her know you mean business,” Carol insisted. “What do I always say? Higher, faster, further baby.”</p><p>Rio smirked and shook her head. Carol found any excuse to share her company moto- one she had come up with in Alice’s kitchen at 2am and never let go off.</p><p>“I’ll think about it,” she replied.</p><p>“Don’t think,” Carol pressed. “Just do.”</p><p>After a moment of consideration, Rio pulled out her phone. “I have an idea.”</p><p>Carol chuckled and patted her on the back. “Go get her, dude.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha loved her job. Sure, it wasn’t perfect, but getting to work analysing and researching something she was so passionate meant she could even look by the ridiculousness of some of her student’s work. She knew teaching a creative writing class would be a bad idea.</p><p>Just as she was reading yet another absurd and sickly love poem, there was a knock at her door. She looked over with a glare. “Come back during my office hours!”</p><p>A familiar voice followed. “Agatha?”</p><p>“Oh, Wanda.” She tossed the poem back onto the pile of papers before her. “Come in.”</p><p>Wanda entered, followed by a skinny boy in ripped jeans and a knitted jumper. His hair was black and curly, and he had eyeliner under his eyes, a look a lot of her students had sported during their ‘alternative’ phase. In his hands were a bouquet of purple roses, and a black giftbag.</p><p>“This young man was looking for you,” Wanda explained.</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair. “Are you in one of my classes?”</p><p>“No, I graduated last year,” the boy replied. “My boss sent me to give you these.”</p><p>She watched him place the flowers carefully on the desk, arranging them neatly along with the giftbag. Once he was done, he stepped back and nodded his head to her.</p><p>“She hopes you like them.” With that, the boy all but scurried out of the room, leaving Agatha with the mysterious delivery and her very nosey friend.</p><p>“Are these from Rio?” Wanda sat in the chair opposite her and appreciated the flowers. “Did you tell her you liked purple?”</p><p>“I did.” Over text, Agatha wanted to add. Rio couldn’t get brownie points for scrolling up through a text chain…right?</p><p>Though she had to admit, they were beautiful flowers.</p><p>Her attention however, gravitated to the little bag. She picked it up and looked inside, frowning when she saw another bag within it. She pulled on the string handles, revealing the little red bag, a familiar brand name written in gold on the sides.</p><p>“Cartier?!” Wanda gasped. “Isn’t the cheapest thing there like six hundred dollars?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer, instead she reached into the bag and pulled out the red jewellery box resting at the bottom. It was small, not ring-sized but it was easy enough for her to hold and open. Pulling up the lid, she found herself starting down at a simple gold band. She lifted it and turned it round in her hands. There were no stones encased in the gold, just a pattern of little circles with a line through each one. Along with it in the box was a small screwdriver.</p><p>Wanda reached over and picked up the tiny tool. “Oh I’ve seen these! You screw them on to fasten them.”</p><p>“I’m guessing its expensive?”</p><p>“They cost like thousands,” Wanda answered, before looking to the bouquet once more. “Hey, there’s a card in the flowers.”</p><p>Agatha dropped the bracelet back in the box and pulled the card from the bouquet. She ripped the envelope open and revealed the card within. On it was a single world.</p><p>
<em>Coffee?</em>
</p><p>Oh the nerve of that woman…</p><p>“What does it say?” Wanda asked, but Agatha ignored her, instead reaching for her phone.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>You really are just another rich jackass aren’t you?</em>
</p><p>The reply came quickly.</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>did you not like the bracelet?</em>
</p><p>Unbelievable.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>You can’t buy me Rio</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>i don’t want to buy you! i just want to go for coffee</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Well I’m no longer interested!</em>
</p><p>Agatha discarded her phone and glared down at the bracelet.</p><p>“So are you going to return it?” Wanda asked, and Agatha laughed.</p><p>“Please. It’s Cartier. I’m not stupid.”</p><p>Wanda gave her a disapproving look.</p><p>“What?” Agatha questioned but her friend just shook her head.</p><p>“I think you’re looking a gift horse in the mouth.”</p><p>“Have you ever heard of the Trojan War?”</p><p>Wanda quickly got to her feet. “Nope. No more Ancient Greek stuff, please.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled as her friend quickly departed, before picking up the golden band once more. </p><p>One thing she knew about Rio was that she had good taste. The rest? She wasn’t quite sure.</p><p> </p><p>Rio cancelled the rest of her days meetings and shut herself in her office. She couldn’t bear to speak to anyone, let alone negotiate multi-million-dollar deals. Not when she had potentially ruined her entire future happiness because she was a fucking idiot.</p><p>That was the last time she was taking relationship advice from Carol Danvers. Not that she would need any more if she didn’t redeem herself to Agatha. The thought of losing her after finally finding her made a tear trickle down Rio’s cheek.</p><p>She leaned back into the black leather of her desk chair, and wondered how much money she would need to create a time machine for the simple purpose of hitting her past self over the head with a tennis racket and insist the flowers would do.</p><p>Cartier. What was she thinking?!</p><p>There was a knock at her office door. A five-beat rhythm that Rio knew anywhere. “Go away, Wu-Gulliver.”</p><p>The door pushed open, and Alice slipped inside. “What a lovely way to greet your best friend.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes in response. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“Billy called me.”</p><p>Rio slumped further in her chair. If she was an asshole, she would fire him on the spot, but she knew the kid was only trying to help.</p><p>Alice sat on the edge of her desk. “So you bought her Cartier?”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>“Why the hell did you do that?”</p><p>“Well Carol said…”</p><p>“Ah.” Alice clicked her fingers. “That explains it.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “I know, I know.”</p><p>“I mean really, Rio? You take advice from the woman heading to her third divorce from the same woman?”</p><p>“At least she managed to get the girl in the first place,” Rio grumbled. “Look at me. I’m a successful hotelier. I’m meant to be a suave eligible bachelor but just thinking of Agatha makes me a fumbling idiot.”</p><p>“Your kind of always were a fumbling idiot,” Alice teased. “Look, you can fix this so easily by going and actually <em>talking</em> to her.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “She won’t want to talk to me.”</p><p>“Fuck sake, Rio. If she’s ‘the one’ like you keep insisting, everything will work out and you can tell your little Vidal the same damn story your dad told you so he can go into this same ridiculous spiral. But even if she throws it all back in your face, isn’t it worth the risk?”</p><p>“Of course it is.” Rio sat up in her seat. “But I can’t just go down to the college and, like, <em>talk to her</em> though, can I?”</p><p>“As long as you don’t dance your way into her lecture singing ‘Can’t Take My Eyes Off You’,” Alice joked, before pointing a warning finger at her. “Or any other song, Rio. I’m fucking serious.”</p><p>“I promise. I’ll just talk to her.”</p><p>Alice grinned. “Good and never talk to Carol about this again. I love her to death, but her love life is a disaster.”</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Rio assured. “I’ll only be coming to you for advice for now on.</p><p>Alice’s smile faded. “Oh great.”</p><p>Rio arrived on campus within the hour and found her way to the English faculty building. Billy had warned her it was accessed by an ID card, and he’d been lucky to bump into someone who let him through. She, however, was not so lucky.</p><p>She pulled out her phone and was ready to text Agatha to come down when someone tapped her on the shoulder. Whirling round, she found herself faced with a tall man with a handsome smile.</p><p>“I had a feeling it was you,” he said with amusement. “You here to see Agatha?”</p><p>Rio frowned. Had Agatha been talking about her? “I am,” she answered, holding out her hand. “Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Call me Kingo,” the man replied. “Does she know you’re coming?”</p><p>“Not exactly…”</p><p>Kingo chuckled. “In the doghouse already? Don’t worry. We’ve all been there. Last year she didn’t talk to me for a week because I spilt my coffee in front of her.”</p><p>Rio smirked amusingly. “She told me her bark is equally as bad as her bite.”</p><p>“She’s just trying to scare you,” Kingo assured. “Now come on, Romeo. I’ll walk you to her office.”</p><p>Kingo led her up to the second floor and brought her to a corridor lined with thick wooden doors, each one labelled with the name of their inhabitant.</p><p>“She’s third on the left,” Kingo told her. “Good luck.”</p><p>Rio gave him a thankful smile before walking towards the door in question. She smiled at the name plague: <strong><em>AGATHA HARKNESS, English Department.</em></strong> She wondered if it would look better with a little Vidal thrown in there too. That was thinking too far ahead though.</p><p>Coffee. Coffee was the goal.</p><p>And so, she knocked on the door.</p><p>“It’s not my office hour,” a voice replied. Rio sucked in a deep breath and pushed the door open.</p><p>Agatha was sat at her desk, looking down at a book. She looked beautiful, as always, but Rio couldn’t help but stare at the glasses perched on the end of that perfect nose. If she wasn’t already head over heels…</p><p>Agatha slammed book shut. “I said it’s not my…”</p><p>Their eyes met, and Rio noted the shock on the other woman’s face.</p><p>Agatha pulled off her glasses. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Rio shut the office door behind her and walked further into the room. “I wanted to apologise. I see now that what I did was…I really wanted to get a coffee with you, and I got some bad advice. I should have, I don’t know, kept asking. I just didn’t know what to do.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “God, you such a loser.”</p><p>Rio nodded in agreement. “Pretty much.”</p><p>“I liked the flowers,” Agatha said, nodding to where they now sat in a clear vase on top of a small bookcase. “Cartier was just…”</p><p>“Too much.” Rio nodded in agreement. “I’m sorry. I’m not used to this kind of thing.”</p><p>“Asking a girl out for coffee?” Agatha questioned. “I find that hard to believe.”</p><p>“It’s true!” Rio insisted. “I-it’s a long story. But, if you’d still entertain me after all this, I was wondering if you’d like to go get a coffee? I’ll even let you pay for yourself if that makes you more comfortable.”</p><p>“Oh no. You’re buying, money bags.” Agatha checked her watch. “I have to set up for a seminar in half an hour. Will the campus coffee cart do?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t control her grin. “Coffee Cart sounds perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha stood back and watched Rio as she ordered their coffees. Here was a woman who bought Cartier jewellery on a whim and could probably purchase the entire university without a second thought. A woman who had likely drunk the finest brews in the world served by people who had probably spent their life training to pour the perfect coffee. Yet there she was, chatting away to the undergrad working the cart like none of that mattered.</p><p>The girl at the cart was one of her students. Harper. She was one of the scholarship kids, and last summer she had stayed on campus to take extra classes. Agatha had assigned her a project to write a small collection of poetry in exchange for extra credit. It also gave her something to do when she wasn’t focusing on her work for the Emily Dickinson Museum. She saw a familiar fire in Harper, and a talent that needed nurturing.</p><p>Agatha decided to approach them and offered her student a smile. “Hi Harper.”</p><p>“Hi Professor,” Harper replied. “Your class this morning was really cool. I love the prompt you gave us. I’ve got some ideas already.”</p><p>“I expected nothing less,” Agatha replied, before looking to the two take-out cups on the counter. “Which ones mine?”</p><p>“This one.” Rio handed one of the cups over. “I made sure to keep track. I put three sugars in mine.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced at the thought.</p><p>“That’ll be seven dollars,” Harper declared, and Rio paid with her phone before fishing in her jacket pocket and handing over twenty dollars cash.</p><p>“Make sure you get yourself a coffee, okay?”</p><p>Harper grinned and pocketed the money. “Thanks, ma’am.”</p><p>Rio gave her a finger salute, before they both walked away to let the next person place their order.</p><p>“That was a generous tip,” Agatha noted, at which Rio shrugged.</p><p>“I’d have given her a fifty, but I didn’t want to be too flashy.”</p><p>Agatha had to admit she was glad Rio wasn’t throwing her money around campus, especially to her top student. “So, who’s this friend of yours who gave you that bad advice?”</p><p>“Carol,” Rio said with clear annoyance. “I should have known better. She’s one of the smartest people I know, but she’s currently on her third divorce in five years, so I should have probably known better.”</p><p>“So she’s had three wives?”</p><p>“No, just one,” Rio answered. “They remarried twice.”</p><p>“Why do they keep splitting up?”</p><p>“Well, the first time it was because Carol was always working, and I think the second time was somewhere along the same lines. This time, though, Carol called it quits.”</p><p>“How come?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “She feels as though it just wasn’t working.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but feel a bit sad for the sorry pair. “Will they get back together?”</p><p>“I don’t know. It’s different this time. Maria has gone and bought a house new New Orleans, and Carol has been spending a lot of time with our friend, Valkyrie. Alice and I think there’s something going on there.”</p><p>“Do you think that’ll end up serious?” Agatha hated that she was invested in this rich girl drama, though there was no messy like big money messy.</p><p>“No, I think they’re just hooking up,” Rio answered. “Valkyrie doesn’t do relationships, and Carol wants to rebound.”</p><p>“But won’t that be messy if they’re friends?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I’m keeping out of it.”</p><p>“Good idea,” Agatha chuckled. “So have you and Carol ever…”</p><p>“No way! We’re just friends.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Do you buy her Cartier too?”</p><p>“Only on special occasions,” Rio joked in return. Agatha laughed along with her, but she began to wonder…</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“What do you want from me?”</p><p>Rio frowned, stopping in her tracks. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“Oh come on. This isn’t just about coffee. We both know you have an ulterior motive here.”</p><p>A guilt smile graced her lips. “Okay, I do.”</p><p>There it was. “Look, if you want to fuck me just…”</p><p>Rio’s eyes went comically wide. “What?! No! God no.”</p><p>Agatha put her free hand on her hip. “So you don’t want to sleep with me?”</p><p>“No, I mean yes, I mean…of course I do but not li-it’s not like that.” Rio looked down at her cup, a red flush on her cheeks.</p><p>“Then what is it?” Agatha questioned. “What do you want from this…courting ritual or whatever it is? Because I seriously don’t understand why you’re so-”</p><p>Rio looked up then, her fluster replaced with a conviction that sent a shiver down her spine. “I want to marry you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught in her throat. Did she just…surely she didn’t mean it, did she?</p><p>“You want to marry me?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I understand that we don’t know each other, and I don’t want to get married <em>right now</em>, but that is what I want in the end.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her in disbelief. This woman was fucking crazy. “Rio, this is the third time we’ve met in person.”</p><p>“I know, it’s just…” Rio bowed her head and stepped away. “I’ve messed up again, haven’t I?”</p><p>“I just don’t…”</p><p>Rio held up her free hand. “I’m gonna go. Thanks for the coffee.”</p><p>“You bought it,” Agatha reminded her. “And we haven’t even drank…”</p><p>“Have a good seminar, Agatha,” Rio said, before rushing off into the crowd of migrating students.</p><p>Agatha stayed stuck to the spot. Had that really just happened? Had Rio just proposed to her? No, proposed her intend to propose seemed more accurate. And then she’d run off, leaving the words stuck in the air like swinging swords.</p><p>She took a sip of the coffee and grimaced. Rio had given her the wrong cup, and she knew the sugary taste would linger in her mouth for the rest of the afternoon, along with the echoes of their conversation in her mind.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha Harkness was a doomscroller.</p><p>Not in the traditional sense of hour and hours spent on TikTok or Instagram or whatever apps her students used instead of focusing on their studies. No, every night, Agatha would log onto her laptop and fall into an internet rabbit hole.</p><p>Most of the time it was to do with work, like a play Kingo would mention or a book Wanda suggest she read. That would then lead to her looking up something else, which would lead her to an article, then to an essay, until it was past midnight, and her eyes were straining at the screen even with her glasses on, swearing the next click would be the last.</p><p>That night, however, there was only one thing on her mind. And so, after settling into bed with her laptop laid on her stomach, she typed in two words:</p><p>
<em>Rio Vidal. </em>
</p><p>Most of the results were generic. Her Wiki page, her company website, posts from business and financial trades that made no sense to her. All pretty basic and boring. Until she found a Forbes article:</p><p>
<strong>
<em>The Last Heiress: Inside the Life and Mind of the World’s Most Successful Hotelier.</em>
</strong>
</p><p>Agatha clicked on the link, and a photograph of Rio all made up in a blue suit flashed before her eyes. Despite her oddness, there was no denying Rio was both beautiful and intriguing. She stared at the image a little too long, before forcing herself to scroll down to read the article itself.</p><p>
<em>Rio Vidal met me in the grand dining room of her 5<sup>th</sup> Avenue hotel. She had contacted my office a few days prior to ask what my favourite desserts were, and by the time we were sat down, an afternoon tea tray filled with my favourite cakes and confectionary was placed on the table beside us. I asked if this was a bribe, and she expressed her confusion. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Isn’t it polite to ask guests what they like to eat?”</em>
</p><p>
<em>That’s when I realised Rio Vidal wasn’t going to be like any other interviewee I’d had be.</em>
</p><p>Agatha laughed to herself as she read on.</p><p>
<em>Ms Vidal was born in Delaware during a work trip that her parents tried to squeeze in before her arrival. However, their first and only child was eager to enter the world and was born in a community hospital a world away from the riches of her birthright. Despite admitting to have only visited the city twice (one of which being her birth), Vidal has since labelled herself a ‘Proud Delawarean’ and has openly joked about retiring there in her old age. </em>
</p><p>Agatha shook her head. There was no way in hell she was living in Delaware let alone dying there…not that Rio’s retirement plan would have anything to do with her. It was just a personal musing.</p><p>
<em>Yet Rio Vidal is very much in her prime, having inherited the Vidal empire after her father’s passing when she was just shy of twenty-one. Since then, she has doubled the company’s fleet of hotels and has further invested in technological, entertainment, and culinary enterprises. However, Vidal is no billionaire, though on paper she should be. Her large donations to charities, from multi-million dollar checks to purpose-built hospital wings and wildlife rehabilitation centres has kept her firmly under the billion-dollar line. In a 2022 interview with Time Magazine, Vidal explained her reasoning for this:</em>
</p><p>
<em>“I’ve never wasted a dollar in my life, and sometimes that means giving what I don’t need to those who do.”</em>
</p><p>Not wasting a dollar, huh? Agatha guessed the ridiculous donation had indeed been for the charity, a very deserving cause too. Though, even after Rio’s declaration that day on campus, she still didn’t understand why she did it. Or any of the bizarre situation they’d found themselves in.</p><p>She scrolled down to the interview section, skimming the questions about business until she found some that were more personal.</p><p>
<strong>You have been labelled as ‘the Last Vidal’, making many question what the future of your family’s empire will have? Is that something you have already considered?</strong>
</p><p><strong>RV</strong>: <em>(laughs) That’s a very morbid question. I will admit, I have thought about it. Of course I have. I’m hoping, however, that I will have children who will continue our family’s legacy. If not, then I will make the proper preparations to ensure the company remains in good hands. </em></p><p>
<strong>And what of your love life? Usually, we see those in similar positions to yourself with a model on each arm, or married to a Miss Universe. When you could have your pick of the most beautiful, accomplished and intelligent women in the world, why have you decided to break the trend and stay single?</strong>
</p><p><strong>RV</strong>: <em>Well, it’s about time that trend ended. I can guarantee most of those relationships and marriages are not based on love, but rather money and status. I have no interested in having a wife that I treat like a trophy while she in turn sees me as the living embodiment of an American Express card. I’d rather be alone forever than be stuck in a situation like that. </em></p><p>
<strong>So you want real love?</strong>
</p><p>
<strong>RV:</strong>
<em> Doesn’t everyone? (laughs). I guess I’m a little old fashioned. My parents were soulmates, as were my grandparents, great-grandparents and so on and so forth. When I meet that person, I’ll be a lovestruck fool and will scream it from the rooftops. Until then, I have work to do. </em>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. Yes, that seemed like a very accurate description of her rela-acquaintanceship with Rio Vidal thus far. It seemed Rio had held on to this idea of a soulmate for a while. She herself had never subscribed to the idea, though she had often read about it. Studied it even. Her research into Emily Dickinson’s relationship with Susan Gilbert had pieced together a forbidden and sorrowful romance that would make Romeo and Juliet seem painless. She didn’t believe any two people were destined to be together though, especially if her person ended up being Rio fucking Vidal.  </p><p>She read that last paragraph again and again and again, before finally having enough willpower to shut her laptop down and turn off her lamp. Still, the words were etched in her mind, and she accepted that she’d be getting very little sleep that night.</p><p> </p><p>Rio was miserable. Even more miserable than before. </p><p>She had barely slept, hadn’t even attempted her usual round on the treadmill, and had Billy fetch her the greasiest, nastiest (but also vegetarian) breakfast burrito he could find when she made it to the office.</p><p>The burrito was a good distraction, and she had Billy send her the location of wherever he got it from for future reference, but once it was done, and she was stuck going through emails and paperwork, the thoughts quickly returned.</p><p>She had told Agatha she wanted to marry her. After only meeting her three times. Why had she thought that would be a good idea?</p><p>The answer was she didn’t think. She trusted her instincts like she always did, and while they were fine-tuned for business, they sucked when it came to anything else. Especially romance.</p><p>It was safe to say she had successfully driven away any chance of them spending any more time together, let alone the whole marriage and kids fantasy she had gotten herself carried away with. She wished she could explain it all to Agatha. About her family, her feels, all of it.</p><p>Instead, she had to just keep herself distracted until she found a way of getting on with her life somehow. Perhaps she should buy something for herself. A sports car? No. She had enough cars. A jet? Nope, bad for the environment. A new pet? No, Victoria would get jealous.</p><p>She was about to look up luxury apartments in Rome when there was a knock at the door and Billy entered.</p><p>Rio offered the boy a smile. After her last assistant moved up in the company, it had taken her six rounds of interviews to find the right replacement. Billy Kaplan was not the most qualified by any means, but she saw the potential and loved making a good investment for the future.</p><p>“Hey Billy, what's up?”</p><p>“Ms Calderu has come to thank you for your generous donation at the children’s benefit. Would you like me to pass on your regards?”</p><p>Rio frowned. Calderu? Why did that name sound- Her eyes widened. “She’s here right now?”</p><p>Billy nodded. “She’s stood by my desk. She’s brought a gift.”</p><p>“Very well. I’d like to accept it myself.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Rio nodded eagerly. “Yes, send her right through.”</p><p>Once Billy left, Rio straightened up her desk and tidied her appearance, wishing she’d put on more than a white button up and slacks that morning. </p><p>The door opened again, and Lilia Calderu walked in, dressed like an old-aged hippie, but Rio knew she was likely wearing a good $15K in jewellery around her neck and wrists. In her hands was a large bouquet of flowers. </p><p>“Hello dear,” Lilia greeted her with a smile. “I wanted to drop these off personally to thank you for the most generous donation you made to the foundation. It alone was enough doubles what we expected to make for the night.”</p><p>“Anything for the children.” Rio took the bouquet and placed it on her desk. “Thank you for the flowers.”</p><p>“You’re very welcome, though they were something of a Trojan Horse to get me here.” Lilia gestured to the chair opposite Rio. “May I?”</p><p>“Please,” Rio insisted, and Lilia sat down, her elbows coming to rest on the desk.</p><p>“I wish to ask you something, Ms Vidal, and I would appreciate it if you answered honestly.”</p><p>“Of course,” Rio insisted. She wasn’t one to lie, and even if she was, she’d never lie to who would hopefully one day become her (god)mother in law.</p><p>Lilia stared her down. “What are your intentions with my goddaughter?”</p><p>“My intentions?”</p><p>“Yes, your intentions. Do you wish to be friends, or...”</p><p>“I wish to marry her.”</p><p>Lilia blinked at her. “You wish to what?”</p><p>“Marry her,” Rio confirmed. </p><p>“But you hardly know each other.”</p><p>“I know but...”</p><p>“If this is about money, then...”</p><p>“No, it would never be about money,” Rio insisted. “Or anything so materialistic.”</p><p>“Then I simply do not understand. </p><p>Rio could see why Lilia was confused, just as she understood why Agatha had been also. Yet she had promised to be honest, and so she continued to be so. “Will you allow me to explain?”</p><p>“I very much wish you would.”</p><p>She told Lilia her family’s story. Explained what she had been told as a young girl, and how she had grown up conflicted about its existence. Then she spoke of Agatha. Of how they literally bumped into each other, and how her world had spun off-axis ever since. To her credit, Lilia listened, waiting until she was done before speaking once more. </p><p>“Does Agatha know this?”</p><p>“Just about the marriage part,” Rio replied.</p><p>“And what did she say?”</p><p>“Not much, but I could tell I had gotten ahead of myself.” </p><p>“Perhaps if we lived in medieval times, your courting ritual would be very sweet,” Lilia noted. “Maybe some women would be swept up in it even now. My goddaughter, however, is not easily swayed. She’s stubborn, ignorant, and far too clever for her own good.”</p><p>Rio bowed her head. This wasn’t sounding promising.</p><p>“Yet she can be kind,” Lilia continued. “And sweet and soft and generous beyond belief. Perhaps try to get to know each other first. Talk to her about books and travelling and whatever it is you yourself enjoy. That may be the key to moving this forward.”</p><p>Rio nodded along, trying not to get her hopes up too much. Was this her receiving Lilia’s blessing?</p><p>“I don’t think she’ll want to talk to me after all this,” Rio admitted. “Not that I can blame her.”</p><p>“You leave Agatha to me,” Lilia insisted. “Just sit tight and keep it cool.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding, trying to push down the hope that had begun to blossom in her heart once more. If trusting Lilia was her only option, she would do so without hesitation.</p><p>After all, Agatha would always be worth the risk.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha met her godmother for her standing afternoon tea reservation at The Palm Court. It was a sudden request, and from what she could tell by the older woman’s tone over the phone, one she could not refuse.</p><p>Lilia was already sat at the table when she arrived and stood to greet her with a kiss on each cheek. “My darling girl! I’m so glad you could make it.”</p><p>“Who am I to pass up free food?” Agatha said as she slumped into her chair. She reached for one of the delicate cakes on the silver stand and took a bite, moaning at the taste. God, that was good.</p><p>If her late mother was there, she would have been scolded for her lack of manners, but like always, Lilia laughed.</p><p>“You still eat like a teenager all these years later,” she teased, while pouring them both some tea. Soon, they started their usual chatter. Agatha updated Lilia about work, and her godmother paid her in kind with a farcical tale from her recent travels. This one involved a Sicilian donkey and a very angry crustacean.</p><p>After a while, however, Lilia’s expression gained a shadow of seriousness. “Now, I ‘m going to cut right to the chase. I didn’t bring you here to simply catch up, though you do know I love to see you.”</p><p>“Okay?” Agatha added some more milk to her tea. “What do you want to discuss?”</p><p>“Rio Vidal.”</p><p>The name shot through her like lightning, but she didn’t let it show. Agatha leaned back in her chair and folded her arms. “What about her?”</p><p>“I went to see her today,” Lilia admitted. “To give her some flowers thanking her for her generous donation at the benefit.”</p><p>Agatha could smell bullshit a mile off. “Oh really? That was your only reason for going?”</p><p>Lilia held up her hands. “Fine, I wanted to ask her what her intentions are with you, and as your legal guardian I have a right to ask.”</p><p>“I’m a grown adult,” Agatha reminded her. “I’m my own legal guardian.”</p><p>“I know, but I wanted to make sure Ms Vidal wasn’t just after getting you into bed.”</p><p>It would be simpler if that was the case, Agatha thought. At least then feelings wouldn’t be involved, and she would know how to handle the situation. She would have likely even accepted. After all, albeit strange, Rio Vidal was a beautiful woman, and she was due a little bit of fun. This, however, she had no idea what to do with.</p><p>“Did she tell you?” she asked, and her heart leaped when Lilia nodded.</p><p>“I was taken aback at first,” Lilia admitted. “Of course, I have heard of quick engagements and whirlwind marriages, but this is something else. Then, after she explained, I understood.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “What do you mean explained? What did she say?”</p><p>Lilia took a sip of her tea before clasping her hands together on top of the table. “That’s an explanation Rio needs to give herself. And I urge you to ask for it with a matter of urgency.”</p><p>“What, are you Team Rio now?” Agatha sneered.</p><p>“She’s a good woman, and she cares about you,” Lilia argued. “Just hear her out.”</p><p>“You really think it’ll change things?”</p><p>“It’ll make you understand,” Lilia answered. “At least give yourself all the information before slamming the door shut.”</p><p>Agatha considered her godmother’s words before sighing in defeat. “Fine. I’ll talk with her.”</p><p>Lilia clapped her hands, a triumphant grin on her face. “Excellent! Now, I’m hosting a dinner on Friday, and I’d very much like you to attend. Just a few people, such as your friend, Alice and Miss Kale. You are very welcome to invite Ms Vidal as your plus one if you should so wish.”</p><p>“I doubt I will,” Agatha told her, though she was already wondering what dress to wear.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had been in the middle of a zoom call with her legal team in Italy when her phone vibrated on the desk. She stole it a glance and saw Agatha’s name scrawled across the screen.</p><p>“Fellas, I need to take this call,” she told the team. “I will be right back.”</p><p>Muting her mic and switching off her camera, she scrambled to answer the call.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p><em>“Hey.”</em> Her voice sounded thick like honey and Rio wanted to swim in its golden, sticky depths.</p><p>“H-how are you?”</p><p><em>“Good,”</em> Agatha answered. <em>“Just leaving a dinner date with Lilia.”</em></p><p>Ah. It seemed Lilia Calderu didn’t mess around.</p><p>“Did you both have a nice time?”</p><p><em>“We did,” </em>Agatah confirmed. <em>“Though we had an interesting conversation about you.”</em></p><p><em>“R-really?”</em> Rio closed her eyes. Oh God what had Lilia said?!</p><p>
<em>“Yes, she told me that you explained this whole bizarre situation to her, and while I would like to argue how absurd it is that my godmother knows more about this than me, I too would like that explanation. So, I want to hear it.”</em>
</p><p>“What? Now?”</p><p>
<em>“Unless you’re too busy?”</em>
</p><p>Rio stole a glance at her zoom call, where her team continued to discuss the matter of city planning. “No, I have time.”</p><p>
<em>“Right, well, go on then.”</em>
</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath and told her the story her father had told her. Word for word. To her credit, Agatha kept surprisingly quiet, though after she was finished, the silence she was met with was near deafening.</p><p>“Well?” Rio asked cautiously. “What are your thoughts?”</p><p><em>“I think this whole thing sounds like the plot of a TV movie,” </em>Agatha sassed. <em>“However, I understand why you’ve got swept up in all this. And I’m flattered, Rio, I truly am, but I’m not the marrying kind. And even if I were, I don’t know you.”</em></p><p>“And I guess I don’t know you,” Rio reluctantly admitted, though in her heart it felt like Agatha had been there forever. “I’d like to, though. Know you, I mean. Even as friends, if that’s something you’d be interested in that is?”</p><p>There was a long pause, and Rio braced herself for a no, a never, the ominous beeps of a call ended. Though it seemed Agatha Harkness was full of surprises.</p><p>“Lilia is hosting an intimate dinner on Friday. Would you be my plus one? Not as a date, but as an…acquaintance.”</p><p>“An acquaintance,” Rio repeated with a grin. “I’ll be there.”</p><p><em>“Very good</em>,” Agatha said sharply. <em>“Well, I will see you then.”</em></p><p>“See you then.”</p><p>Agatha ended the call, but Rio didn’t mind. She allowed herself a moment to grin and kick her feet with excitement, before composing herself properly. Turning back on her mic and camera, she greeted her legal team with a smile.</p><p>“So, where were we?”</p>

<p>Rio stared at the plans for the Rome hotel. The legal team had everything at hand and she had already begun speaking with architects and experts to preserve the building’s features. It was always important to her to keep a building’s character, especially a buidling in the historical part of one of the oldest cities in the world.</p><p>She wanted to get it right. No, needed to. No Vidal Hotel was the same, and from the heart of New York to the coast of New Zealand, each was created and managed with the upmost scrutiny and care. Yet Rio’s mind kept wandering, as it had done for days.</p><p>She had a serious case of Agatha Harkness on the brain.</p><p>Other days she had scolded herself. After all, she had a company to run. Yet for that day only, she allowed herself a free pass.</p><p>It was Friday. The night of Lilia’s dinner, and she was going as Agatha’s…acquaintance.</p><p>Her heart was practically bursting out of her chest. She just wanted to be there already, to be with her. Though she would just have to wait.</p><p>She decided to drop Agatha a text, in the hopes that would satisfy her impatience.</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>looking forward to tonight. do you want me to pick you up?</em>
</p><p>The reply came quickly.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>As long as you don’t turn up in a horse-drawn carriage.</em>
</p><p>Rio smirked to herself.</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>damn i’d better cancel the marching band too…</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>I can’t tell if you’re joking…</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>guess you’ll have to wait and see.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Are you always this annoying?</em>
</p><p>Rio’s smirk transformed into a grin.</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>yep!</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Great. Be at my place for six and don’t you dare be late. And stay by the car!</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p><em>yes ma’am</em>🫡<em> </em></p><p>Rio put down her phone and looked back at her work. It was difficult looking over the plans without actually being on the ground. She wanted to walk through the rooms, look out the windows, be able to feel the lifeforce of the building through the walls. A hotel to some were just a bed for the night, but to her it was more than that. It was an experience where dreams can be fulfilled, and happiness can be found. It was important every project went perfectly, and her usual hands-on approach would always ensure that.</p><p>Yet going to Rome would mean leaving New York. Leaving Agatha. It was silly, she knew. It would only be for a few days, but she still worried. What if Agatha suddenly decided she too was the one, and needed to see her in person that minute and she was stuck halfway across the world?</p><p>Also, Victoria was due to arrive over the weekend, and she was not fond of Trans-Atlantic flights.</p><p>She googled what the term dates for Westview University, and saw that classes stopped early May with graduation a few weeks after. Perhaps Agatha would have a more flexible schedule then? Maybe they could go together? As acquaintances, of course.</p><p>She shook the thought away. Nope. She was getting way too ahead of herself. They had dinner to get through first, and Rio needed it to be a good one.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had a problem. A big fucking problem.</p><p>It was her office hour, which was quieter than usual. The calm before the storm of finals week, she presumed. It meant, however, she had nothing to do but wait, and so she found herself on Google again, clicking the name at the top of her recent search list.</p><p>
<em>Rio Vidal.</em>
</p><p>It had happened a lot. First thing in a morning, last thing at night, while eating dinner and now, it seemed, while waiting for students to come tell her about their problems. She had officially entered a doomscroll rabbit hole she could not escape.</p><p>This time, she was on images. Most of them from business events or hotel openings. Nothing too exciting or scandalous, just fancy outfits in fancy places. Still, she couldn’t deny that Rio looked stunning in every single one of them. </p><p>She scrolled through, admiring each stunning smile as she went, until one image made her pause. </p><p>Rio was stood in a sound booth with a grin on her face, her hair tied back in a messy ponytail. She was wearing a tight black vest that framed her cleavage just right, while a thick silver chain rested around her neck. </p><p>Agatha bit her lip. Okay, she looked really fucking hot.</p><p>She clicked on the link below, and found it was an article from last summer: an interview with Alice Wu-Gulliver. Rio’s friend from the benefit, who she would see with Jen at Lilia’s that evening. Agatha skimmed through the article, until she finally found what she was looking for.</p><p>
<em>Wu-Gulliver said having the hotelier be backing vocals on her song was “her favourite collaboration.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>“Rio was there when I wrote the song and helped me find the melody. It seemed only right she ended up on the record.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>Vidal is also a talented musician and had previously stepped up to help with the famous quarantine sessions during the Covid-19 pandemic. </em>
</p><p>
<em>“We were quarantining together, and I wanted to do the album in my home studio, so Rio helped with drums and piano. It was a learning curve for both of us, but I think it turned out pretty good.”</em>
</p><p>
<em>When asked if she and Vidal were indeed just friends, she laughed. “She’s like my sister. My very strange and annoying sister. But whoever snaps her up will be a lucky lady. She has a heart of gold.”</em>
</p><p>Agatha was about to look more into these quarantine sessions when there was a knock at her door. She quickly shut the laptop and pushed herself back into reality. “Come in”</p><p>The door creaked open, and a familiar face appeared. “Hi Professor Harkness.”</p><p>“Harper, what a nice surprise! Please, come sit.”</p><p>Harper stepped across the room, dropping her tote bag to the side of the chair opposite her professor before sitting down. Agatha watched her eyes dart around as they always did, at all the pictures and bookshelves that covered her office walls, before she began rummaging through her bag.</p><p>“I wanted to ask about the  feedback you gave me for the poem assignment.”</p><p>Agatha frowned as Harper handed over the now crumpled paper, and read over her comments. It all seemed fair to her. “What seems to be the problem?”</p><p>“Everyone else got full pages of feedback and I just got a few annotations.”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I was wondering what I did wrong?”</p><p>Agatha’s frown deepened. “Wrong?”</p><p>“Yeah, because you didn’t give me feedback. Was it…is it bad or…”</p><p>“What? No, of course it wasn’t bad.”</p><p>Harper still remained confused. “Then why didn’t you give me that much feedback?”</p><p>Agatha smiled amusingly at the girl. She really had no clue. “Perhaps there isn’t much feedback is because I didn’t have much to give?”</p><p>“Oh.” Harper’s eyes widened with clear surprise. “Right.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled and handed the paper back. “You did well. Very well, indeed. I look forward to your next one.”</p><p>Haper took the paper and carefully folded it back in her bag. “Thanks, and sorry for wasting your time.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha assured. “How’s picking a major going?”</p><p>Harper shrugged. “Pretty good. I’m hoping to choose English.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “I’d be disappointed if you didn’t.”</p><p>Harper offered her a bright smile, before getting to her feet. “Thank you for your time, professor.”</p><p>“Anytime,” Agatha assured, and watched the student leave. She wasn’t meant to have favourites, but she preferred Harper to the others in the class. For starters, she had a braincell, and she worked hard. An attribute she had great appreciation for.</p><p>Alone again, she opened her laptop once more. Agatha gave rockstar Rio one last glance before closing the tab. She needed to get a hold of herself. After all, she would be seeing enough of Rio that night, in her all strange and annoying glory.</p><p>She was definitely <em>not </em>looking forward to it.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s driver pulled up outside Agatha’s building ten minutes ahead of schedule. She had planned for bad traffic, but they had gotten there without much fuss.</p><p>Climbing out of the car, she straightened up her appearance. She had dressed in a simple black pants and blazer combo, with a low-cut black vest underneath. She knew people often went all out for these small, high society dinners, but that wasn’t her style. Even when she had a lady to impress.</p><p>Agatha must have seen her pull up, because before Rio could text her arrival, the brunette beauty emerged from the building. She couldn’t make out much of what Agatha was wearing under her coat, but the curls in her hair were more prominent than usual, and she wanted to tangle herself in them right there on the street.</p><p>“You’re early,” Agatha commented, and Rio nodded.</p><p>“Didn’t want to keep you waiting.”</p><p>She held the door open, and Agatha climbed into the car. Rio slid back in beside her and pulled the door shut.</p><p>Almost as soon as her driver set off, Agatha piped up again.</p><p>“Okay, an idiots guide to surviving Lilia’s dinner parties. Eat wherever she gives you, try follow the conversation because it can get a little out there sometimes, and don’t, under any circumstances, let Lilia do a psychic reading for you.”</p><p>“Lilia’s psychic?”</p><p>“No, but she thinks she is.”</p><p>Rio considered Agatha’s words before smiling. “You look amazing.”</p><p>Agatha bowed her head. “Thanks.”</p><p>“That’s something friends say, right?” Rio questioned. “I mean, ‘acquaintances’.”</p><p>“Do you say it to Alice?”</p><p>“I say she looks awesome,” Rio answered. “You know, in that rock and roll kind of way.”</p><p>Agatha sighed in defeat. “Fine, then I guess you look rather dapper yourself.”</p><p>Rio grinned the rest of the way there.</p><p>Lilia’s home was a stylish terrace mansion on the upper east side. Very flashy, very unique. Very Lilia. Agatha walked in like she owned the place, pulling off her coat to reveal a thin, navy knitted dress that hugged everything perfectly. It took everything in Rio not to stare.</p><p>The click of high heels echoed, and their host appeared from an adjoining room, dressing as outrageous as ever. Now Agatha had told her, Rio could see the psychic vibes.</p><p>“Welcome!” She greeted them both with a kiss on each cheek. “Come on through. The others are already here.”</p><p>To Rio’s relief, the others were indeed Alice and Jen. The former looking out of place (even at a fancy dinner, she dressed like a rockstar), while the latter, in their pink silk dress, looked very much at home. Lilia took her place at the top of the table, while Rio pulled out the chair beside her for Agatha to sit.</p><p>“Very gentlemanly,” Jen commented, and Rio noticed Agatha shot her a glare in response.</p><p>Rio sat beside her and smiled across at Alice, who simply raised her eyebrows.</p><p>It seemed Lilia had hired a chef and server for the evening. The server poured them all a glass of wine, before announcing the first course would be out shortly.</p><p>“So Rio,” Lilia began. “How are you?”</p><p>“Good. Happy to be here. Thank you for having me.”</p><p>“Well, it’s my pleasure,” Lilia stole a glance at Agatha. “I’m glad Agatha asked you to come.”</p><p>“Seeing as Jen invited her…friend, I thought I’d bring my own.”</p><p>Jen snorted. “So you two have the same kind of friendship as me and Alice?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened for a moment before narrowing with anger. “You know what I meant.”</p><p>The first course soon arrived, while paused the conversation for a while. It was a creamy tomato soup, and Rio was relieved. Though she knew the next course would be a meat dish, she was glad it would only be one.</p><p>Once done, there were a few short conversations. Alice talked about her latest studio sessions, Jen shared some of the latest gossip in the ‘Rick bitch’ social circle, and Agatha criticized anything and everything. Lilia however, remained quiet, and Rio could feel her eyes fixed on her.</p><p>The next course was a vegetarian linguine. Rio frowned. She hadn’t told Lilia she didn’t eat meat, and when she looked to Alice questioningly, she simply shrugged. If Alice didn’t tell their host Rio preferred not to eat meat, there was only one other person who could have told her.</p><p>She smiled to herself as she tucked into the delicious meal.</p><p>“How’s work, Rio?” Alice asked. “Been busy?”</p><p>“Always.” Rio took a sip of her wine. “I’m finalizing the plans for the new hotel.”</p><p>“Oh?” Jen questioned. “Where abouts is this one?”</p><p>“Rome. It’s an old building, not far from the Pantheon. We’re working on removing the modern features, embracing the history while also granting the usual modern luxuries.”</p><p>“Do you have photos?” Lilia asked, and Rio pulled out her phone to show them. Jen and Lilia seemed impressed, while Agatha seemed mildly interested.</p><p>“Have you been yet?” Alice asked, and Rio shook her head. </p><p>“No, I’m supervising from afar.”</p><p>Alice frowned. “You always watch over renovating a new hotel.”</p><p>Rio stole a glance at Agatha, who was watching her closely. “I have other stuff I need to deal with here. Also, Victoria is arriving tomorrow.”</p><p>Lilia frowned. “Victoria?” </p><p>
<em>“My Tarantula” </em>
</p><p>
<em>“Her Tarantula.”</em>
</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, who had distracted herself by stabbing at her spaghetti.</p><p>“Oh, you’re already in sync,” Jen teased, only for Alice to elbow her. “What? They are!”</p><p>Lilia cleared her throat. “When are planning to visit Rome then? In summer?”</p><p>“Potentially,” she answered. “We’ll see.”</p><p>She noticed Agatha glance her way, but the moment their eyes met she looked away again. </p><p>“I have a villa in Sicily,” Lilia told her. “Why don’t we have a girl’s trip?”</p><p>Jen shot up in her seat. “That sounds perfect. We can fly to Rome for a few days. Rio can work while we shop!”</p><p>“Rio also has a place on Lake Como,” Alice helpfully supplied. “We could go there too.”</p><p>Lilia clapped her hands. “That’s settled then. What dates are everyone available?”</p><p>“I have none,” Agatha told them firmly. “Some of us have actual jobs besides being rich.”</p><p>“Hey, I have a job,” Alice argued, at which Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“Debatable, but fine.”</p><p>“You must be going on summer break soon though,” Jen commented. “Don’t colleges break off in like, what? Mid-May?”</p><p>“It’s not a break for professors,” Agatha reminded her. “I still need to work.”</p><p>“You can work pool-side,” Lilia told her. “It’ll be good for you to get a little sun.”</p><p>“Oh yes. Sunburn. Fun.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip as not to laugh.</p><p>“Don’t be a smartass,” Lilia snapped. “We’ll send each other our availability and go from there. It’ll be fun, and maybe…enlightening.”</p><p>Agatha caught Rio’s eye before stabbing her fork through the spaghetti once more.<br/>Rio took that as she’ll think about it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha refused to speak all the way through dessert. Jen had tried to bait her, Lilia had asked her questions, and Alice had an annoying tendency to make sure she was okay. She ignored them, devouring the chocolate fudge cake before stealing what Rio had left over. It may not have been good for her, but it made her feel better at least. She really wanted to leave.</p><p>In the end, it was Rio to the rescue.</p><p>“I thank you for your hospitality,” she said to Lilia as she got to her feet, “but I have a business call with Rome at 4AM, and I need at least a few hours’ sleep.”</p><p>“Of course.” Lilia went to stand, but Rio held up a hand to stop her.</p><p>“Please, stay and enjoy your evening, though I will have to steal your niece. I didn’t promise to get her home safe.”</p><p>“Who did you promise?” Jen questioned, and Agatha wondered the same.</p><p>“Myself,” Rio answered. “And I always keep my promises.”</p><p>Agatha dabbed her lips with a napkin, before standing also. “Well, ladies. I’d say it’s been a pleasure, but I’d be lying.”</p><p>Lilia simply rolled her eyes. “Goodbye Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha gave her godmother a petty wave before leading Rio out of the dining room. She grabbed her coat and shrugged it on.</p><p>“Is your car here?”</p><p>“It’s been here the whole time,” Rio explained. “My driver is binge-watching <em>Married at First Sight Australia</em>.”</p><p>“Does anything normal ever come out of your mouth?” Agatha asked as they exited the mansion.</p><p>Rio smirked with amusement. “I guess you’ll have to see.”</p><p>Once in the safety of the car, Rio asked the question Agatha had been dreading. “Are you alright?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” she assured. “Always am.”</p><p>“Just ignore the Rome stuff,” Rio told her. “You’re a busy woman. You don’t have time to be galivanting all over Italy.”</p><p>“Neither do you,” Agatha argued. “But you didn’t argue.”</p><p>“Well, it would be a business trip for me,” Rio reminded her. “Sandwiched by a bit of leisure.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “So not pleasure?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You know the answer to that.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip and looked down at her lap. “Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I know you want more from me than this, and I appreciate you stepping back.”</p><p>“Hey, I’ll do whatever you want,” Rio insisted. “All you have to do is ask.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in understanding. “So if I did want you to marry me, which is not what I’m asking so don’t get excited, I’d just have to ask?”</p><p>“Ask me to ask you,” Rio corrected. “I want to propose.”</p><p>Agatha eyed her suspiciously. “You have a ring, don’t you.”</p><p>“No, I don’t.”</p><p>“Honestly?”</p><p>Rio held up her hands. “I swear. No ring has been purchased.”</p><p>“Right, well, I’m glad we are in agreement.”</p><p>“Me too.” Rio smiled at her, and Agatha’s heart skipped at the sight.</p><p>Nope, nope. Absolutely not!</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. “So, how big is the carbon footprint of your stupid tarantula?”</p><p>They chatted casually the rest of the way home, and Agatha promise to call Rio at some point that week. Rio remained giddy, and she played it cool in response. Or cold. Sometimes she didn’t know the difference.</p><p>It was an hour or so later, when she was in her pyjamas and laid in bed, that her mind wandered into dangerous territory once more. Picking up her laptop, she typed in those two words again.</p><p>
<em>Rio Vidal.</em>
</p><p>This time, she went on videos. Most of them were of hotel grand openings and short interviews at events. All entertaining enough, especially when Rio got a little flustered or said something dorky, but nothing that was too captivating. That was until she found one that immediately spiked her interest. It was a recording of a conference speech regarding the safety of Marine life off the Australia coast.</p><p>Rio stood at a podium, dressed in a grey pant suit, reading from the prepared speech before her.</p><p>
<em>“There is no doubt that Australia is home to some of the world’s most spectacular wonders of the natural world. One of which being the Great Barrier Reef. A place of outstanding natural beauty, a hive of marine life, and most importantly the setting for Finding Nemo. (Laughter). Yet the Great Barrier Reef is dying, as are other habitats for marine life along the Australian coastline. And that’s all down to us. Human beings. How? Well, by being careless. That’s the basics of it. We’re a careless species, a selfish species, and it was about time…”</em>
</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, listening to her go on and on about fucking fish. God, there was something about her voice. She hadn’t noticed it before, but it was so smooth, so thick. She wanted to wrap herself in it and never leave.</p><p>She recalled the way Rio said her name, how she complimented her, how she praised her like she was the best thing to ever exist. She bit her lip hard. Although she’d deny it until her last breath, it made her feel so fucking good.</p><p>Her hand began to slip down her stomach to the waistband of her sleep shorts, slipping under until she found…</p><p>Agatha shot up and slammed her laptop shut.</p><p>No, no, no. She wasn’t doing this. Absolutely not. Never, ever in a million years.</p><p>Switching off her light, she curled up against the pillows and clenched her eyes shut.</p><p>It was nothing more than a moment of weakness, she told herself. One she swore would never, <em>ever </em>happen again.</p><p>Ever.</p>

<p>“So let me get this straight. You got the chance to villa hop around Italy and you <em>refused</em>?!”</p><p>Agatha sighed. She should have just said the dinner went fine, but no. She had to fucking complain and yap herself into a corner. Now, her entire lunch break was being taken up by this ridiculous interrogation.</p><p>“I don’t want to live that lifestyle anymore,” she explained, but her friend wasn’t convinced.</p><p>“You’re not ‘living that lifestyle’. You’re going on vacation with your friends.”</p><p>“They’re not my friends,” Agatha insisted. “Lilia is my godmother, Jen is just someone I know from school, I hardly know Alice, and Rio is…well, Rio.”</p><p>“Yes, Rio is definitely Rio,” Wanda teased. “How’s that going, by the way?”</p><p>“We’re talking,” Agatha shrugged. “It’s nothing really.”</p><p>“But you said she wants to marry you?”</p><p>“I know, but she’s respecting my boundaries.”</p><p>“So, you told her you don’t want to marry her?”</p><p>“I told her I’ll tell her if I ever want to marry her.”</p><p>“Seriously?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Wanda laughed and shook her head. “Agatha, do you like Rio?”</p><p>“I tolerate her.”</p><p>“But do you have any <em>feelings</em> towards her?”</p><p>“Not particularly,” Agatha lied. She didn’t have romantic feelings, that was certain. Lustful feelings? Well, they had crept up on her unexpectedly, and she had promptly pushed them away. She had also stopped looking up Rio online, though she had spent most of her morning class thinking about one particular photo she’d seen that captured her arm muscles just right…</p><p>Luckily, her phone buzzed before her mind jumped headfirst into the gutter.</p><p>

</p><p>“I don’t even have to ask who you’re talking to,” Wanda teased again. “How is she?”</p><p>“Her stupid spider has arrived,” Agatha answered. “And she doesn’t understand that you can’t personify every animal, or arachnid in this case.”</p><p>“Is that your usual conversation then?” Wanda questioned. “Spiders?”</p><p>There was no usual conversation with Rio. It ranged from casual checking in to deep conversations about whatever topic seemed to grip them that day.</p><p>On Saturday night they stayed up until 2am talking about the nuances and subtext of <em>Xena: Warrior Princess</em>. Agatha admitted that she’d figured out she was a lesbian when she kept rewinding tapes of episodes to the ‘Starring Lucy Lawless’ part of the intro. When Xena stands and turns, her dark hair blowing in the wind with the clear blue sea in the background. When she smiles so brightly that she made Baby Gay Agatha’s tummy do summersaults.</p><p>Rio didn’t laugh, didn’t tease. Instead, she agreed it was pretty hot and joked that she would have her agent send Lucy Lawless flowers for her services to the sapphic community.</p><p>Talking with Rio was interesting. If she was to turn her literary analysis skills to their conversations, Agatha would say that the conversations fulfilled her need for attention. After all, Rio would discuss anything she wanted and would listen to any story or factual anecdote with intrigue and would always ask to know more.</p><p>They had a few conflicts of opinion, though. Agatha was not interested in sports and found them ridiculous, while Rio was very active, both physically and supportively, in many sports. She was a shareholder of <em>The New York Liberty </em>WNBA team and had an executive box at <em>Arsenal</em> with a plan to buy shares if they were ever put up for sale. Agatha preferred anything she was reading to be on paper, while Rio liked to keep everything electronic. She went on a whole tangent about how the physical media industry was unnecessarily damaging the environment. Yet when Agatha pointed out she probably had a half a rainforest worth of books in her apartment, Rio had been more intrigued than scandalised.</p><p>“It’s mostly small talk,” Agatha answered. “Nothing exciting.”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “You’re a good liar, Harkness, but your dismissiveness is a tell.”</p><p>“I’m dismissing it because it is indeed nothing,” Agatha insisted. “And anyway, I have a young literary genius to mentor. Did you read the poem I sent you?”</p><p>“I did,” Wanda confirmed. “Harper is certainly a talented girl. I do worry about her, though. I was talking to her after class yesterday and she said they are kicking her out of dorms for the summer, and the coffee cart is closing while the campus is quiet. I told her I would keep an ear out for any cheap rentals, and I think she’s looking for some waitressing gigs.”</p><p>Agatha thought for a moment, before pulling out her phone. “Leave it with me.”</p><p>Wanda frowned. “What are you doing?”</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>You wouldn’t know of any summer jobs at any of your hotels, would you?</em>
</p><p>As always, Rio replied quickly.</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>i can look into it! why are you asking?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>My top student needs work. She is getting kicked out of the dorms and needs to find a way to pay rent on a summer let. </em>
</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>

</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>You’ve met her. She’s the girl from the coffee cart.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>ah yes harper!</em>
</p><p>Agatha was surprised she remembered her name, though she guessed that day had been pretty memorable.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>You know she can make a good cup of coffee, even if you did mix them up!</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>

</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Thank you</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>anything for you </em>
</p><p>That last message made her heart jump. She had already suspected she had Rio wrapped around her little finger, but actually having tangible evidence of the fact made it undeniably real.</p><p>“You’re so painfully obvious,” Wanda commented. “Just ask her out already.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare. Her friend was an idiot. Whatever limited affection she had for Rio didn’t even warrant asking her to go for coffee, let alone a date.</p><p>“How are you and Vision doing?” Agatha asked, and the look of exasperation that appeared on the other woman’s face told her she had successfully moved the conversation along.</p><p>For now, at least.</p><p> </p><p>Rio had brought Victoria to the office for some bonding time.</p><p>She often felt guilty owning a pet that was so often cared for by others. She worried that when she had a child, she would be away too much to truly bond with them. Her father had tried to master the balance by taking her with him everywhere, but she had to admit she wished she had a home. That one place that would have defined her childhood, where most days were the same and she had school, and steady friends, and hobbies beyond what a hotel complex could offer. If she were to have children with Agatha, she knew education would be important, and that they would need to have a base where Agatha could work. It would mean she would have a home to return to when she came back, but she knew the constant leaving would hurt her greatly.</p><p>Victoria didn’t seem emotionally scarred by her absence, always happy to climb her arm and balance on her fingers, but a child would be different. A child would miss her, a child would resent her. Her child, who she wanted more than anything. Well equal to one other person, but they would hopefully come part in parcel.</p><p>As she put Victoria back in her travel enclosure, she thought over what she and Agatha had discussed earlier. Rio, despite being what some labelled a ‘nepo-baby’, always believed in hiring by merit. She had worked to make herself worthy of the mantel she had inherited and had always hired the children of friends at the lowest levels, forcing  them to work for what they wanted. It may seem harsh, but it was fair.</p><p>However, this wasn’t a rich kid that needed life skills. This was Agatha’s student, someone who it seemed to already be working hard while pursuing their education. She pictured Agatha quite the harsh professor, so to be in such good graces also meant Harper was a capable and intelligent young person. Perhaps she was someone worth taking a chance on.</p><p>She called her assistant through. “Billy, how would you feel if I gave you your own assistant for the summer?”</p><p>The boy frowned. “Am I falling behind?”</p><p>“No, not at all! It’s just I often do a lot of travelling over the summer months, which means things need to be kept afloat here, there and everywhere. I figured I’d offer you a helping hand.”</p><p>Billy smiled. “That would be great. Is it one of the interns or…”</p><p>“No, no. I have someone in mind. I will have her contact you soon and we can begin the hiring process.”</p><p>Billy nodded in understanding and went off yapping about ‘cute adjoining desks’.</p><p>Pulling out her phone, she messaged Agatha.</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p><em>can you please give harper this</em> <em>and ask her to get in touch as soon as possible</em></p><p>She sent a copy of Billy’s work contacts, at which Agatha replied with a simple thumbs up. Rio checked the time and figured she must be teaching.</p><p>She smiled, imagining her stood in front of a room of students, talking passionately about literature. Someday, she would have to sit in the back of one of her lectures, though she’d likely be too busy staring to take any of the information in. How any of her students got any work done, she would never know.</p><p>Her smile quickly faded when her laptop chimed, and a new email from one of her legal reps dropped into her inbox.</p><p>
<em>Dear Ms Vidal,</em>
</p><p>
<em>The plans submitted to convert the existing hotel has not only been approved, but the Mayor of Rome wishes to be involved in the restoration of the building’s original façade and internal features. The mayor’s office has requested a meeting to go over the plans and wishes you to be present. I have told them this may have to be over a video call, but it may put us in better graces if you came here in person. There are also design aspects the architects and interior designers wish to walk through with you. </em>
</p><p>
<em>I understand you are very busy, but at least few weeks in Italy would really help the project move forward. Also, the food here is pretty good, if that helps persuade you.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Hope to hear from you soon,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Matthew Murdock</em>
</p><p>Rio grumbled and put her head in her hands.</p><p>She knew she had to go.</p><p>This project was an important one, and it had all been put off long enough. There was no question she had to head to Rome as soon as possible. Even though she had just met Agatha, and they seemed to be in a pretty good place. A place where they were finally getting to know each other, and she had to fucking leave.</p><p>This was the worst timing ever.</p><p>She picked up her phone again.</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>can we get a drink or something tonight? nothing fancy! just need to talk</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s reply came about ten minutes later.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Okay? There’s a diner near campus. I’ll send you the address. Say about 7-ish?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>perfect see you then</em>
</p><p>Tossing her phone aside, she called Billy back through.</p><p>After all, she had plane tickets to book.</p><p> </p><p>The diner Agatha had suggested was somewhere a multi-millionaire to be spending their evenings, but sure enough Rio was sat there in a booth, somehow blending in perfectly.</p><p>She stood when Agatha approached and greeted her with a bright smile. “Wow, Professor Harkness. You look nice.”</p><p>She was just in her work clothes, but Rio was a charmer, or she had a thing for women in blazers.</p><p>Agatha looked Rio over, noting she had her hair up in a messy bun, her long bangs framing the sides of her face. She looked almost…pretty. “Shall we sit?”</p><p>Rio nodded, and they both slid into opposite sides of the booth. The waitress materialised at their table before Agatha even had a chance to put her bag down.</p><p>“What can I get you, ladies?”</p><p>“A coke, please,” Rio answered, before looking to Agatha. “Do you need a few minutes?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Black coffee, please.”</p><p>The waitress nodded and headed off.</p><p>“You’ll be up all night with all that caffeine,” Rio said with a chuckle.</p><p>Agatha laughed with her before shrugging. “I’m fuelled by coffee these days.”</p><p>She honestly couldn’t remember the last night she woke up truly refreshed. Perhaps it had never happened. The years she lived with her mother were filled with torment, and the years after were spent with regret. Her body had likely forgotten how to rest or was never taught to do so in the first place.</p><p>“The sun is deceiving me,” Rio noted, looking out of the window at the lingering daylight. “I wish the sun would set at the same time every day.”</p><p>“That would be boring,” Agatha commented. “I like walking out of movie theatres and it suddenly being pitch black outside.”</p><p>“Yeah, or when you wake up on a flight and suddenly its sunrise.”</p><p>The waitress returned with their drinks, and they got some fries to share as a before-dinner snack.</p><p>“I can’t stay long,” Rio admitted. “Otherwise, I’d have taken you out for dinner.”</p><p>“This is fine with me,” she insisted. “I have leftovers waiting for me at home, anyway.”</p><p>“Leftover what?”</p><p>“Doesn’t matter. What did you want to talk about?”</p><p>Rio took a sip of coke. “No small talk this evening, Ms Harkness?”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“It’s not something I can just jump into,” Rio argued. “Can we wait for the fries and then…”</p><p>“Well now I need to know right this instant,” Agatha demanded.          </p><p>“Agatha, I…”</p><p>“Just tell me!”</p><p>Rio sighed in defeat. “I have to go to Rome.”</p><p>Agatah frowned. Was that it? “Okay, well you said you were thinking of…”</p><p>“No, I have to go tonight,” Rio specified. “I’m going to the airport as soon as we’re done here. And I…I’m not sure when I’ll be back.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, her brain digesting this new information. Really, she should be pleased. After all, she had wanted Rio out of her hair. Yet she wasn’t pleased at all. Maybe not sad. More…disappointed.</p><p>The waitress brought their fries, placing the plate down on the table between them before making a quick escape. Rio took the first fry, biting into it before gasping.</p><p>“Shit, that’s hot!”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You’re such a child.”</p><p>Rio blew on the rest of the fry and ate it, before sipping at her coke once more.</p><p>“How come you have to go to Rome?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Legal stuff, and design stuff. I need to be on the ground to get things moving.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. That was understandable. “Will you come back when you’re done?”</p><p>“As soon as I can,” Rio promised. “It may only be a few weeks, but I don’t know.”</p><p>Agatha picked up a fry of her own and made a show of blowing it before popping it in her mouth. “So that was it?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio answered.</p><p>“Could you not have called to tell me that instead?”</p><p>Rio shrugged awkwardly. “I wanted to see you one last time before I left.”</p><p>A warmth rushed through Agatha’s chest, so intense she had to adjust in her seat.</p><p>“Well,” she imagined. “Here I am.”</p><p>“Indeed, you are,” Rio laughed. “So, how was your work today?”</p><p>They talked about this and that, the pile of chips shrinking and their drinks shallowing until they were all empty. Rio offered to drive her home, but Agatha declined. The airport was in the opposite direction, and it wasn’t a long walk.</p><p>“I’ll message you,” Rio promised as they stepped outside. “Maybe call too, if you want?”</p><p>“Maybe.” Agatha nodded to the car already parked outside. “Does he just wait for you all the time?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “He’s not too happy I’m going away. It means he has to watch <em>Gold Rush</em> with his husband.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “You do live a strange life, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio repeated. “But it’s definitely been more exciting with you in it.”</p><p>Before Agatha could question what she meant, Rio had leaned in and placed a light kiss to her cheek.</p><p>“Te veo.”</p><p>Then Rio quickly treated to her car, jumping into the back seat. As soon as the door shut, the car drove off, leaving Agatha shocked still on the sidewalk, her hand lightly touching her cheek. Then, her shock faded into annoyance.</p><p>Rio Vidal was most certainly the bane of her existence.</p><p>When she got back to her apartment, she reheated her leftovers and ate it miserably at her tiny dining table. After doing the dishes, she changed into her pyjamas and laid  out on the couch with her laptop resting on her stomach.</p><p>She decided to search Rio up on YouTube and found her environmental speech again. She picked up where she left out, and listened as Rio listed the number of avoidable things we all do that harms the oceans.</p><p>Agatha’s hand reached up to touch her cheek. The kiss had been quick, like a sudden shock running through her. She barely had chance to register how Rio’s lips felt, but it still made her imagination run wild. Wondering what it would be like to have Rio kiss her lips, kiss her neck, her chest, her stomach, her…</p><p>Fuck it.</p><p>Her hand slipped under her shorts, finding her clit with ease. She groaned and raised her hips, her hooded eyes still locked onto the screen. Rio continued talking about dying fish, but Agatha couldn’t make out the words, just the thick sound of her voice.</p><p>She imagined Rio touching her like this, working hard between her legs, whispering into her ear.</p><p><em>Go on, Agatha,</em> Rio’s imaginary voice urged. <em>Give it to me.</em></p><p>Her back arched as pleasure coursed through her. “Fuck, Rio!”</p><p>When the waves within her calmed, and Rio’s voice became words again, Agatha flopped back and stared at the ceiling.</p><p>She was totally fucked.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rome was no doubt a beautiful city. </p><p>For a long time, Rio hadn’t understood why her father never opened a hotel there. After all, it was a huge European capital with millions of visitors a year, and it wasn’t like they didn’t already have hotels in Florence, Venice, and Naples. After those, Rome should have been a no-brainer. Then, as she began to look into opening a hotel there herself, she realized why.</p><p>The hotel had to capture the heart of the city, embrace its history and culture. Rio had a clear vision of what she wanted, and it had taken her years to finally find the right foundations to make it a reality.</p><p>Rome. The unconquerable territory about to be finally brandish the Vidal name. A city of beauty and art and fucking good food.</p><p>Yet every moment spent there made Rio all the more miserable.</p><p>She missed Agatha.</p><p>She missed her like the moon missed the sun, and the waves missed the shore. She missed her so deeply sometimes she could hardly think, hardly breathe. She missed her…yet there wasn’t much she could do about it.</p><p>They’d kept in contact, or rather they <em>had</em>. The texting had died off a little, though Agatha had explained finals were coming up which took up a lot of her time. Still, Rio missed her. Enough that she contacted Lilia for Agatha’s address so she could send a postcard. It had taken her a few nights alone in her hotel suite to craft what she was going to say, but once she did, she found the perfect postcard and sent it off to New York.</p><p>That satisfied her for a few hours, but the loneliness hit her again not long after.</p><p>Rio decided to take a walk and ended up at the Piazza Navona. She found a little tiramisu place nearby and took a photo of the outside to show Agatha.</p><p>

</p><p>
<em>Loud, smelly, annoying…I’m currently waiting for my 11:30 mediation with a student who has been caught cheating on one of Wanda’s assignments. I’m representing the faculty as I don’t trust Wanda not to scream at the kid. </em>

</p><p>

</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Scream at the kid with a bit more class…when are you coming back? Harper told me your assistant doesn’t know. Speaking of which, how has she met Victoria before me?!</em>
</p><p>Rio chuckled to herself, earning a few odd looks from passersby. </p><p>

</p><p>
<em>first answer: i too have no idea. we’re still finalizing all the designs and logistics. hopefully soon!</em>
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Oh I’m not the one needing luck right now! I’ll speak to you soon.</em>
</p><p>Rio put her phone away and looked at the old buildings surrounding her. </p><p>A beautiful city, undoubtably. Though without Agatha, it just felt hollow. </p><p>The tiramisu was really good though.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was surrounded by finals papers. Her poetry class had submitted their work, and most of it had been atrocious. The course work specified a collection of 10 poems, a piece explaining their inspirations and methods of work, and a short piece literary study on a poet of their choice.</p><p>Thus far she had read a collection of love poems dotting on their quarter back boyfriend, poems based on the current political climate which were both generic and depressing, and a rather pompous collection that chose to ‘disregard the laws of poetry’ that made absolutely no sense.</p><p>She was saving Harper’s for last, hoping it would restore her faith in the minds of today’s youth. Yet the lack-lustre submissions were so uncaptivating that she found her mind wandering to other things.</p><p>Other people.</p><p>Other <em>person</em>.</p><p>Rio had said three weeks. It had nearly been over four. Agatha didn’t know why she cared. After all, they had only seen each other in person a handful of times, yet there was something about not being <em>able</em> to see her that was most irritating. How was she to show Rio how much she didn’t want to be with her if she wasn’t around to actively criticize and ignore?</p><p>Yes, she could ignore her messages, but then Rio would just call and, well, hearing Rio’s voice was a little…interesting at the moment. Agatha shook the thoughts away.</p><p>Yes, Rio’s voice got her off, but she had a nice voice, and it fit whatever totally unrelated-to-any-person kink she until that point unknowingly existed in the back of her mind. Was it the best masturbation session(s) she’d had, well, ever? Yes. And? That meant nothing. And even if it did, it was just sexual, and even then, it was just a fantasy. She wouldn’t actually want to have sex with her…but even if she did…</p><p>The buzz of her intercom broke through her dangerous thoughts, and she quickly got up to answer.</p><p>“Hello?”</p><p><em>“Darling,” </em>Lilia’s unmistakable voice chilled through the speaker. <em> “May I come up?” </em></p><p>Agatha sighed. “Bring my mail up with you.”</p><p>She opened her door in time to see Lilia climbing the last few steps of the stairs, a small pile of envelopes in her hands.</p><p>“You need to get a building with an elevator,” Lilia told her. “These stairs won’t help your knees.”</p><p>“It’s a two-story building,” Agatha reminded her. “Your stairs are higher.”</p><p>“Perhaps, but they aren’t as steep.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. Lilia had an answer for everything. Once Lilia was inside, she took the pile of mail and slammed the door shut. “Want a coffee?”</p><p>“A glass of water will do just fine after that climb,” Lilia answered as she perched in the single armchair, and Agatha headed to her kitchen. She returned with the water, before dropping onto her couch, looking through her mail. </p><p>“So, what are you doing here?”</p><p>“Can’t I drop by to see my favourite goddaughter?”</p><p>Agatha looked up from the phone bill she was currently skimming to give her former guardian a suspicious look. “For starters, I’m your only goddaughter, and secondly, you never just ‘drop in’. So, what do you really want?” </p><p>Lilia chuckled, but didn’t mess around any longer. “I’m going to my villa in two weeks, and I want you to come with me.”</p><p>“In Sicily?” Agatha should have known that was coming. She looked back down at her phone bill, trying to show disinterest.</p><p>“Yes. Jen and Alice are interested, and I spoke to Rio…”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up again. “You’ve been speaking to Rio?”</p><p>Lilia nodded. “She said she would fly down to see us even without you going, though I’m sure she’d prefer it if you were there too.”</p><p>“I can’t,” Agatha answered quickly.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Agatha gave her a look. “You know why.”</p><p>“If this is about your mother…”</p><p>“It’s about me wanting to live <em>my</em> life. The life <em>I </em>made myself.”</p><p>“With a little help from me,” Lilia reminded her. “And I would love to spend more time with you. Or is there no room in your new life for me anymore?”</p><p>Agatha set her mail aside. “You know there is.”</p><p>“Then come on vacation with me. And if not for me, do it so you can see the woman you’re obviously pining over.”</p><p>“I’m not pining over anyone,” Agatha snapped. “Especially not <em>Rio.</em>”</p><p>Lilia smirked. “The Cartier on your wrist says otherwise.”</p><p>Agatha looked to the ring of gold resting around her left wrist. She had put it on three days after Rio left, and had it taken it off since.</p><p>“I lost the little screw,” she lied. “I can’t get it off.”</p><p>“I could try with a…”</p><p>“No, no.” Agatha pulled her arm to her chest, covering her wrist with her other hand. “It’s fine. It makes me look more important.” </p><p>Lilia laughed sharply. “Okay, now I think you need to come to Sicily for the sake of your own sanity.”</p><p>“My sanity?”</p><p>“Yes, so you can face this Rio situation head on.” </p><p>“There is no Rio situation,” Agatha insisted. “For some reason she’s decided I’m the one, but I don’t feel the same way. At all.”</p><p>Lilia pursed her lips. “Agatha, maybe you need to consider that your pride is getting in the way of your happiness.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “So, you think Rio’s money will make me happy? Her millionaire lifestyle and stupid parties and designer clothes and…”</p><p>“No,” Lilia answered. “I think <em>Rio</em> will make you happy. This life you’ve built is fine, Agatha, but it’s lonely. I was lucky. I had you, and I know you love Wanda and the boys but it’s not the same. Having someone won’t take away your independence. Not if they’re the right one.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment as Lilia’s words sunk in, before she abruptly cleared her throat. “As lovely as this has been, I need to finish grading these papers.” </p><p>Lilia nodded, finishing off her water before getting to her feet. “Just think about it. Even if it’s just a summer flirtation, I think it’s worth exploring.”</p><p>Agatha saw Lilia out, making a point of slamming the door behind her. She checked through her mail and found nothing of interest. Tossing it aside, she made her way back to her room and the waiting mountain of mediocrity she still needed to grade.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat up in bed, the Italian sun streaking through the windows of her hotel suite. Waking up alone had never really bothered her. She liked her routine, and having to work around some else had never appealed to her.</p><p>Yet mornings in Rome were lonely. The city was full of life, and her days were full of meetings were filled with passionate conversation, sometimes even jokes and laughter. Yet they still didn’t capture the sting.</p><p>It had been over a week since she sent Agatha the postcard, yet she had heard nothing of it’s arrival. She knew it wouldn’t be a quick journey, but she had paid for the quickest delivery. And it wasn’t like she and Agatha hadn’t been in contact. Quite the opposite, actually.</p><p>They talked a lot in the mornings, before Agatha was about to sleep and when Rio was only just waking up, but sometimes Rio sent her pictures of things throughout the day. From hidden roman ruins she suddenly found while exploring, to random stuff she found at souvenir stands. In return, Agatha would tell her a little about her day, and how the student she had reprimanded for cheating kept running away from her.</p><p>Yet the postcard was not mentioned.</p><p>Perhaps Agatha had received it, and simply didn’t tell her. Had she bothered reading it? Had it pushed them apart even further? What if it was lost in the mail? Should she write another?</p><p>She flopped back against the pillows. Her father had never said this would be so painful. Maybe it had been okay for him. Her parents had been totally devoted to each other, and while she was ready to devote her entire life to Agatha’s every whim, she knew her love didn’t feel the same.</p><p>Her morning was pretty clear, so she decided to go get a haircut. At first it wasn’t going to be drastic, just to tidy up the ends, but then one thing led to another, and she suddenly had shoulder-length hair with the slightest hint of bangs.</p><p>Feeling bold, she sent Agatha a selfie.</p><p>

<em>thoughts?</em>
</p><p>She was walking down the street when she got a reply.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Seems hotels aren’t the only things getting renovations. </em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>does that mean it looks good or…</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>It looks fine, but I will need to see it in person before I can make a proper judgement. Any news on when you’ll be back?</em>
</p><p>Rio smirked to herself.</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>why? missing me?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>No, but I think Victoria will be.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>She’s fine. i facetime her everyday</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>You facetime her, but when I asked you to facetime me at the Trevi Fountain, you refused.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>you try standing in that crowd!!</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>You could have gone when it was less crowded.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>if ever i can’t sleep, i’ll go down there especially for you. but you better answer!</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>I promise I will! I’ve never seen that damn fountain. Only time I’ve been to Rome was for a banquet Lilia had been invited to. We drove by the colosseum and that was it!</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>maybe you need to come see it in person</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Maybe</em>
</p><p>A loud beep brought her back to the present, and she waved apologetically to the driver she had walked out in front of, before heading down a side street of shops. She was near the Piazza di Spagna, in the more luxurious shopping districts.  She looked in the windows as she passed. At the designer handbags and expensive shoes and the sunglasses that did the same thing as $20 sunglasses but were sold for a hundred times more. Everything boring and logoed to high heaven, yet cost more than what most people would spend on a…</p><p>She froze to the spot.</p><p>Resting in a box, in a jeweller’s window, was the perfect ring. An elegant lilac sapphire resting on a thin band of white gold. She knew it was the one the moment she saw it, much like the woman who was destined to wear it.</p><p>Without thinking, she walked straight inside.</p><p>The shop attendant quickly moved to greet her. “How may I help you, signora?”</p><p>“The ring in the window.” Rio pointed to it. “The lilac sapphire. Can you tell me anything about it?”</p><p>The man retrieved the ring and brought it over. “It’s vintage, made around the 1940s, acquired at auction in Austria. 14ct white gold and a sapphire weighing 7ct. A fine piece, certainly.”</p><p>Seeing it up close only made her all the more certain. This was most definitely the one.</p><p>Yet was it wise to buy it?</p><p>Despite their text conversations, there hadn’t been much progress in their relationship. Friendship. Acquaintanceship. Whatever the hell it was. Lilia had invited her to her villa in Sicily, and Rio had accepted either way, but the possibility of Agatha being there had filled her with the upmost excitement. Yet from what Alice had told her, Agatha was reluctant to come.</p><p>Alice had also said that Jen had mentioned Agatha having a thing about ‘rich people shit’, but Rio figured if Agatha was at all interested in her, even as a friend, she would show up. Like she herself would. Just to spend some time with her.</p><p>But there wasn’t much she could do about it. She said she would wait for Agatha to give the word, and she needed to respect that. Which meant no jumping ahead, no high expectations and certainly no ring!</p><p>But there was no harm in being prepared, right?</p><p>Rio looked to the assistant with a grin. “I’ll take it.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s new haircut had played on Agatha’s mind over the following days.</p><p>She wasn’t sure why. It wasn’t totally drastic or unique. Her hair was just shorter, that was all. Still, she couldn’t get it out of her head.</p><p>It had joined the oceans video and the arms photo in her little fantasy, one she fully embraced behind closed doors yet seemed to slip into her thoughts whenever they begin to wander.</p><p>Such as in the English Department break room, with a pen in her hand at the ready to mark more papers. Her brain, however, was stubbornly stuck on one thought. Of grasping Rio’s freshly cut hair in a fist and pulling…</p><p>“You’re going to crush that pen,” Wanda warned her. “I guess that paper is really something.”</p><p>Agatha looked at the student’s work before her. She almost felt bad that she hadn’t read it properly, though she figured if it was any good it would have kept her focused. Really, she should fail them for allowing her mind to sliver back to the gutter.</p><p>She looked to Wanda, who sat in the chair opposite her, taking what appeared to be a tactical break from her own marking.</p><p>“The only passionate reaction these papers give me is totally despair for the future.”</p><p>“So, you were thinking of something else then? Or I suppose, someone?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a warning look. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>Unphased, Wanda took a sip of her coffee. “Have you decided yet?”</p><p>“Decided what?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“On Rome. Or is it Sicily now?” Wanda waved the thought off. “Either way, are you going to Italy to see your future wife or what?”</p><p>“I’m not marrying her,” Agatha huffed. “Not now, not ever.”</p><p>Wanda held her hands up defensively. “Hey, don’t take it out on me. You could do with some sun, though. As a refresh more than anything.”</p><p>“I can refresh in Amherst, surrounded by fellow academics and all things Emily Dickinson.”</p><p>“Or you could be surrounded by a hot millionaire that if you asked would service you six ways to Sunday.”</p><p>Agatha threw her pen at her. “You’re worse than Kingo.”</p><p>“Hey, I’m living through your love life since mine is totally stagnant.”</p><p>“You and Vision still not good?” Agatha asked, and Wanda shook her head.</p><p>“It’s like we’re just…existing together. Even the boys can tell things aren’t right, but I don’t know how to fix it. And even if we can, do I want to? Maybe we’d be better off just co-parenting, but I don’t want to hurt the boys. I just wish we hadn’t got to this point.”</p><p>“Have you talked to him about it?”</p><p>“I’ve tried, but he’s being evasive. He knows the writings on the wall and doesn’t want to deal with it.”</p><p>Agatha gave her friend a sympathetic smile. “It’ll work itself out one way or another. It’ll have to.”</p><p>Wanda nodded in agreement. “Hence why I need you to live out this epic love story so I can enjoy it from afar.”</p><p>Suddenly, Agatha’s sympathy was gone. “I wouldn’t call it epic...”</p><p>“But you’d call in a love story?” Wanda asked with a teasing grin.</p><p>“No, I didn’t-I mean I…” Agatha folded her arms and scowled. “Oh shut up.”</p><p>Wanda just laughed, and even though she got the last word, Agatha knew she’d lost that battle.</p><p>When she’d had marked the papers, with no help from her so-called friend, Agatha decided to call it a day. She was walking across the quad, on her way to pick up a coffee for the walk home, when her phone chimed. She checked the notifications on her lock screen.</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>almost got run over taking this</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Sent a Photo</em>
</p><p>Agatha opened the messages and couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>The image was of a sticker stuck to a cobbled ground. It showed Snoopy and Woodstock riding a bike with flames coming off the back wheel, <em>TOO FAST FOR POLIZIA</em> written underneath. The image amused her enough, but the mental image of Rio holding up traffic to seemingly take photos of the ground had her giggling to herself.</p><p>So much so, that even Harper noticed her amusement when she arrived at the coffee cart.</p><p>“You seem happy, professor?”</p><p>Agatha showed her the photo and Harper chuckled, before getting to work making her usual order.</p><p>“Ms Vidal is having a good time in Rome, then?”</p><p>“She seems to be,” Agatha answered. “It’s a work trip, so I imagine it’s not too entertaining.”</p><p>“Billy said he doesn’t think she’ll be back for at least another month.”</p><p>Ah yes, Rio’s assistant. Who also had the same name as her dear godson. It was a good job she didn’t spend much time with Rio, otherwise that would get confusing.</p><p>“Maybe, maybe not,” Agatha said dismissively.</p><p>“What are your plans for summer break?” Harper asked as she put the finishing touches on the coffee.</p><p>“Working, mostly,” Agatha admitted. “My aunt has invited me to Sicily, but…”</p><p>“Sicily! Oh, that sounds amazing,” Harper grinned. “That sounds like the perfect break for you.”</p><p>Agatha eyed her suspiciously. “Really?”</p><p>Harper nodded. “I want to go to Europe at some point, but I need to get my degree first. You know, before college I’d never been out of my home state. Going to Europe would be like…I don’t know, like entering this whole new world that only ever existed in books and films before.”</p><p>“You should write about that,” Agatha advised. “A poem or short prose piece.”</p><p>Harper handed over the coffee. “You never know, Sicily is pretty close to Rome. You may even get to see Ms Vidal.”</p><p>“I may indeed.” Agatha gave Harper the money and told her to keep the change. “I’ll miss you making me coffee over the break. I enjoy our little chats.”</p><p>“I’ll be making coffee at the Vidal offices,” Harper reminded her. “And that’ll be free!”</p><p>Agatha bid Harper a fond farewell before heading home. As she walked and drank her coffee, she thought back over what both Wanda and Harper had said. Despite her prejudices, she knew it was a generous invitation for anyone who hadn’t grown up in her situation, and she shouldn’t be denying herself a good time because of the past. Still, there was something in her that was stopping her from saying yes. A blockade she must have put up long ago to protect herself from harm.</p><p>She guessed it was something for her to think on, at least.</p><p>When she reached her building, she picked up her mail and headed upstairs. Once in her apartment, she tossed her things by the door and flipped through the mail.</p><p>Bill.</p><p>Bill.</p><p>Bill.</p><p>Postcard.</p><p>Bill- wait, postcard?</p><p>Agatha discarded the rest of the mail and studied the postcard with both hands. On the front was an image of the Colosseum, with <em>Roma</em> written in one corner. A simple enough postcard, which surprised her given the obvious sender.</p><p>Turning it over, she found a scrawling message.</p><p>
<em>Hi Agatha,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Greetings from Rome! I kept seeing these postcards everywhere and I wanted to send you one. </em>
</p><p>
<em>Rome is a wonderful city, and I wish you were here to explore it with me. And the hotel is going well! It’s a work in progress, bit I think you’d be impressed when it’s done. It’s certainly one of our most ambitious projects yet!</em>
</p><p>
<em>I hope New York is treating you well, and finals aren’t kicking your ass. Maybe we can celebrate the end of another successful school year when we see each other again?</em>
</p><p>
<em>Until then, I wish you the very best, and I hope we meet again sometime soon.</em>
</p><p>
<em>Love,</em>
</p><p>
<em>Rio</em>
</p><p>Agatha read those last two words over and over, her heart beating hard in her chest. It was only an expression, she told herself, but there was no denying it was there in black at white. And the rest of it, well, what could she say?</p><p>Rio hadn’t needed to send her a postcard. She did it just because she wanted to. No fancy bracelets or bouquets, just a postcard that cost less than a dollar, thrown in a random Rome post box to get to her.</p><p>It was a simple act, but it knocked through something inside her. Something that suddenly made her bold.</p><p>She kept hold of it as she dialled the number she needed. They picked up after three rings.</p><p><em>“Agatha?”</em> Lilia’s voice was laced with concern. <em>“Is everything okay?”</em></p><p>“Everything’s fine,” Agatha assured, even if her heart was racing like a freight train. “I just called to say that…to say that I’ve thought about it and I-I want to come. I want to go to Sicily.”</p>

<p>Agatha didn’t know why she agreed to this.</p><p>The school year had ended, the students were gone, and she was currently sat poolside at a Sicilian villa, trying to read her book while being surrounded by bickering idiots.</p><p>“Alice, will you please put on a better playlist,” Jen huffed as she moved to grab the little boombox. “This is killing the vibe.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with it?” Alice questioned as Jen turned the boombox off.</p><p>“Rock music doesn’t exactly give ‘cute Sicilian summer’, baby.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to puke at the nickname. “I prefer Alice’s music to whatever that spiritual crap was you were playing earlier. We’re not doing yoga or ‘finding our inner self’.”</p><p>“No one asked you,” Jen snapped. “I’m trying to catch some rays, and I can’t do that listening to Ozzy Osbourne.”</p><p>“It was The Cure,” Alice corrected, but Jen had already settled back on her sunbed, basking in the midday sun. Alice herself was laid on the bed next to her, tapping at her phone, while Lilia sat under the canopy, enjoying her second cocktail of the day.</p><p>Lilia’s villa had two faces. The front and most of the interior represented that of a Sicilian farmhouse, rustic but with Lilia’s flair for the beautiful and bizarre. In the lounge, she had commissioned abstract line depictions of the Roman Gods to cover the walls and had filled the space with artisan furniture pieces. Yet through the back doors was a paradise, with luscious plants, a gorgeous deck and pool, all worked into the cliffside to grant the most beautiful view of the turquoise ocean below.</p><p>Even Agatha had to admit it was impressive, though between the bickering situationship and her godmother drinking half the liquor cabinet before noon, she wished she was in better company.</p><p>Her phone chimed beside her, and she bookmarked her page to check the notification.</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>How’s your vacation going?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Amazingly I haven’t killed anyone yet, though I’ve been tempted…</em>
</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Is it nice there at least?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>It’s beautiful! I’ll send some pictures later.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Yes please! So...how’s Rio?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>She’s not here yet.</em>
</p><p>The plan had been for Rio to arrive the same day as them, but Rio had contacted Lilia the day before they were set to fly to say there had been a set-back with the hotel. She hoped to be there at some point in the evening, but by the following morning, there was still no sign of her.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t impatient to see her, per say, but the fact they were waiting for her to arrive was very irritating. The reasonable side of her brain understood why she had to deal with whatever hotel emergency she’d got wrapped up in, but the other side wished she would grow a pair and ditch whatever she was going to just fly down already. The woman owned the company. Could she not do as she pleased?</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Then maybe things will pick up when she arrives.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Yeah maybe.</em>
</p><p>She doubted it very much, though at least she would be able to have conversations that didn’t involve self-care, music, and psychic nonsense.</p><p>Agatha put her phone back and was about to pick up her book again when it chimed once more.</p><p>“Agatha, will you put that thing on silent,” Jen complained. “It’s messing with the tranquillity.”</p><p>“Mehmehmeh,” Agatha replied as she checked the message.</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>how’s the weather there?</em>
</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips as she typed her reply.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Why don’t you hurry up down here and find out for yourself</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>i’ll be there soon</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>How long is soon?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>soon, i promise!</em>
</p><p>Agatha tossed her phone aside and picked up her book again. If Rio was in no rush to get there, then she was in no rush for her to arrive. Which she wasn’t in the first place, because this trip wasn’t about seeing Rio. No, it was about catching up on her reading and getting a light tan and experiencing the local culture. It was most certainly <em>not</em> about Rio Vidal, and so her presence, or lack thereof, was of no consequence to her.</p><p>None at all.</p><p>She must have dozed off, because the next thing she knew, someone was splashing water on her legs. She jumped, knocking her book on the floor. Her eyes adjusted to the sunlight and soon spotted Alice staring at her nervously from the pool.</p><p>“Really? How old are you and you’re cannonballing into the pool?”</p><p>“It wasn’t a cannonball,” Alice insisted. “I just…jumped with my legs tucked in.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. She should have known Rio’s best friend and Jen’s situationship would be just as annoying and ridiculousness.</p><p>“What time is it?” she asked, reaching for her phone.</p><p>“About midday,” Jen answered. “And you’d better go put some more sunscreen on because your legs are looking pretty pink right now, Harkness.</p><p>Agatha looked down and found her legs were indeed starting to burn.</p><p>“Shit,” she cursed. “Why didn’t you wake me?”</p><p>“We tried but you kept telling us to fuck off,” Alice said, before ducking under the water. Agatha huffed and grabbed her robe from the back of her sunbed. She stood to shrug it on and tied it with an angry tug.</p><p>“I knew this trip would be a disaster. I just didn’t expect it to happen on the first full fucking day. Not only have you all been insufferable, but now I’ve got this to deal with.”</p><p>“My God, Agatha,” Jen snapped. “Can you quit being a bitch for five fucking minutes? Stop complaining about stupid shit.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Seriously? All you do is whine, Kale, and treat your girlfriend like shit. Oh, sorry, I mean your <em>friend.”</em></p><p>“Don’t go there, Harkness.” Jen pointed a warning finger at her. “Because there’s only one reason why you’ve come on the trip, and I have no problem shouting it for the next villa to hear.”</p><p>“I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>It was Jen’s turn to laugh. “Please, we’re not stupid. It’s blatantly fucking obvious why you’re here.”</p><p>“Jen,” Alice said warningly as she swam to the edge of the pool. “Just leave it.”</p><p>“No, Alice, I’m not having this shit all vacation. She can either back off or get a taste of her own medicine.”</p><p>Agatha held out her hands questioningly. “Jen, I have no idea what you’re talking about. Whatever it is, you’ve made up in your fucking head.”</p><p>“Oh really? So, you’ve not come here to fuck Ri…”</p><p>“Jen!” Alice snapped, before pulling herself out of the pool. “Seriously, enough. It’s their business, not ours.”</p><p>“But she started it,” Jen accused. “She said…”</p><p>“Look who’s here everyone!” Lilia walked out into the sun, her voice breaking through the conflict. “Right in time for a spot of lunch!”</p><p>They all looked over and saw Rio appear beside her.</p><p>Rio was dressed in a suit of sorts- a white pleated skirt with two hooks keeping the matching jacket shut. Even from where she was stood, Agatha could see the tease of a black bra underneath, but her attention drifted upwards. To Rio’s gorgeous face and her hair, shorter than before but framing her face so perfectly.</p><p>Agatha’s heart thud fast in her chest. Fuck, fuck, fuck. No, she needed to keep cool. Keep cool, keep cool, keep cool.</p><p>Rio stepped into the sunlight, waving down at Alice and giving a greeting nod to Jen, before her eyes finally locked onto her. “Hi Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “Hi Rio.”</p><p>They stayed like that, just staring back at each other, until Lilia clapped her hands.</p><p>“Get yourselves dry and ready to eat. Rio got us some fresh pastries on her way here.”</p><p>“Oh Rio, aren’t you lovely.” Jen smirked as she got up, nudging Agatha as she went. “We’re all <em>so </em>happy you’re finally here.”</p><p>Nudging Jen right back, Agatha stormed inside, avoiding Rio’s concerned gaze as she went.</p><p>This was set to be the worst vacation ever.</p><p> </p><p>The five of them tucked into their pastries, while Lilia told them all the story of how she came to buy the villa. Jen and Alice were listening, and Rio tried to. She really did. Yet she couldn’t help stealing glances across the table. To admire the vision before her.</p><p>Agatha Harkness. Sat right there in the flesh.</p><p>All those lonely nights in Rome, all those days wandering aimlessly through the streets, all of the hard decisions and long business meetings. Suddenly, they were all worth it. As on that path, it led her to that moment. To somehow being reunited with Agatha half-way across the world. At a beautiful villa in a beautiful place, with the most beautiful person she had ever seen.</p><p>Rio felt like the luckiest creature in existence.</p><p>“And I just thought, ‘what the hell?’” Lilia continued. “If I didn’t like it, I could invest a little and sell it for twice the price. It was an impulsive decision, but not one I regret. It keeps me close to my roots. Sicily is in my blood, and so it’s only fitting that there’s a part of me here.”</p><p>“I must admit, I did keep my old townhouse in Indianapolis,” Jen added. “I just rent it out now, but I like to know there’s a bit of me still there.”</p><p>“I was born on a tour bus somewhere on Route 5,” Alice admitted. “That’s probably why I feel so at home on them.”</p><p>“What about you, Rio?” Lilia asked. “Where do you call home?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Wherever I lay my hat, I guess.”</p><p>“You must call somewhere home,” Jen pressed. “Where were you born?”</p><p>“Well, that’s kind of…”</p><p>“She was born in Denver,” Agatha answered, startling the table to silence. Rio herself was particularly surprised. She didn’t remember telling her that?</p><p>It was Jen who spoke up first, accompanied by a teasing smirk. “And you know how?”</p><p>“Google,” Agatha answered, before taking a large bite out of her croissant.</p><p>“You googled me?” Rio asked in surprise, and Agatha rolled her eyes as she chewed aggressively on the pastry.</p><p>“You spent millions to take me on a date. Of course I googled you.”</p><p>Rio considered it for a moment. “Can I google you?”</p><p>“If you must,” Agatha said dismissively, before continuing to devour her croissant.</p><p>Rio fought the urge to jump on her phone that very moment, but instead chose to move the conversation along. “So, what are the plans for this afternoon?”</p><p>“We were thinking of going to the beach,” Jen answered. “Before little miss snoozy fell asleep in the sun and burnt her legs.”</p><p>“I’ll come for the walk,” Agatha said with her mouth full. “Need to clear my head a little.”</p><p>Rio frowned in concern. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha quickly nodded. “Fine, I just need to have some headspace. You know, after finals and stuff. My head is still all over the place.”</p><p>She accepted the answer, but if Alice and Jen’s knowing looks were anything to go by, she knew there was more to it than that.</p><p>“Well after lunch, I’ll show you to your room, Rio,” Lilia announced. “It’s got a lovely view and you’ll be right next to Agatha. In fact, you’ll be sharing the adjoining bathroom, if that is okay with you?”</p><p>“Fine with me,” Rio assured, while Agatha grumbled.</p><p>“Great. This trip just keeps getting better and better.”</p><p>Rio looked to Alice, who gave her a sympathetic shrug. Okay, so things weren’t exactly going smoothly, but she could make it work. She could make this a vacation Agatha could enjoy.</p><p>Perhaps after a little googling, though.</p><p> </p><p>The walk to the beach was short in distance but to Agatha it seemed to go on forever. Mostly because she was walking behind Rio for the most of it and she kept catching glimpses of her butt cheeks under the salmon shirt she was using as a cover up.</p><p>By the time they reached the beach, Agatha was pleased to find half of it was owned by a hotel for guests only, and the other half of it was too pebbled for Jen to lounge out comfortably. An act of karma, she decided, and wished them the <em>best time </em>before heading off on her own.</p><p>The area of coastline was reasonably quiet. Mother high-price villas, a fancy hotel resort, and a small town that had mostly been taken up by seasonal workers and Airbnbs. There wasn’t much for her to see, but it was the perfect pretty yet uninteresting backdrop she needed for her thoughts to resonate.</p><p>Her main thought being Rio.</p><p>Okay, perhaps she lied to herself a little earlier. She had wanted to see Rio. So much so that her sudden arrival had made her so tense it was almost suffocating. Foolishly, she hadn’t anticipated the fight or flight reaction her body endured at the sight of the woman she had got off to for over a month.</p><p>It didn’t help that her new hair looked even more hot in person, and her smile was made even more radiant by the Sicilian sun, and how perky that teasing glimpse of ass had been. Her annoying personality wasn’t grating on her either, though she figured she was just use to her bizarre mannerisms after their strings of strange text conversations since Rio left for Rome.</p><p>Maybe Wanda and Lilia were right- she just needed to just give in and get this…<em>infatuation</em> out of her system. Yet, knowing Rio, one kiss would equal a marriage agreement.</p><p>She soon stumbled across a cute little shop. One that sold trinkets and silly souvenirs for keep sakes and gifts for those waiting back home. Outside was a rack of postcards, and Agatha found herself perusing them.</p><p>The postcard Rio had sent her remained in her apartment, a magnet pinning it to her fridge for safe keeping. She turned it over every once in a while (at least once a day) just to read the message over again and had pathetically taken a photograph of it before she left just in case she wished to read it once again. Thus far, she read it on the way to check-in at the airport, and before she went to sleep the night before. Agatha doubted she would read it again, not with the real Rio only a shared bathroom away.</p><p>She suspected Lilia made that room assignment on purpose, though she would never be able to prove it.</p><p>One of the postcards on the rack was a vintage photograph of a dog sat on what looked like a rustic shipping boat. For some reason, it reminded her of Rio. It was something she’d likely find amusing, and she did seem to have a deep connection with animals.</p><p>She reached up to touch it, only to pause when the golden band on her wrist caught the sunlight. That damn Cartier bracelet that was now truly stuck to her wrist.</p><p> Though she had lied when Lilia had asked her about it, she had since <em>actually</em> lost the little screwdriver, and so the four-thousand-dollar bracelet was cursed to be submerged in chlorine water and lathered in sunscreen.</p><p>Still, she liked the feel of it on her wrist. It made her feel powerful, and had absolutely nothing to do with the woman who gifted it to her.</p><p>She bought the postcard and slipped it into her bag before heading back in the direction of the beach. When she got there, however, she found her friends were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>Agatha frowned. Had those rich bitches left without her because she swore down…</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>She looked round and saw Rio stood waving at her…from the private side of the beach, holding what looked like a piña colada in her other hand.</p><p>“Rio?” she questioned as she approached the rope barrier. “What are you doing on that side? It’s private.”</p><p>“I know, but it’s fine.” She then waved over to someone before calling out: “This one is with me too!”</p><p>A man in a light blue polo and white pants walked over and unclipped the rope for her to walk through.</p><p>“Can I get the madam a drink?”</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a questioning look before regarding the man with a cautious smile. “I’ll have what she’s having.”</p><p>The man nodded and headed off, leaving Agatha to cross her arms and stare Rio down. “Well?”</p><p>“It’s a long story,” Rio admitted. “But I, well, I own part of this hotel.”</p><p>Agatha covered her face with her hands. “Of course you do.”</p><p>“I’m not an active owner,” she insisted. “My friends are majority owners and get the say in what’s what. During the pandemic their profits dropped, like most resort hotels did, so I helped them out. I offered to give them the shares back, but they like being able to put ‘Part of the Vidal Group’ on pitches and stuff. Makes it seem less of a gamble to other investors.”</p><p>“Right.” Agatha didn’t know what to think of it. “Well, at least it means we can use the amenities, I guess.”</p><p>“Way ahead of you. I have booked us in for dinner here tomorrow night.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows raised. “And Lilia agreed to that?”</p><p>“She suggested it,” Rio answered. “Jen and Alice want to use the tennis courts too, and the spa. But anyway, for now it got us sunbeds and free drinks. Come along. I made sure to save you a space with us.”</p><p>When they made it back to the group, who were all settled on their respective beds enjoying the sun and unlimited drinks, Agatha found the free bed was next to Rio’s. Because where else would it fucking be?</p><p>She watched as Rio set her drink on the handy little table between their sunbeds, before her hands moved to unbutton her shirt. “The beds are pretty comfy, you know. I’ll have to tell Natasha she made a good choice with these.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer, just stared as Rio’s bikini-clad body was revealed to her. Revealing her abs, her thighs, the curve of her hips.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck.</p><p>Rio wasn’t just hot. She was <em>really</em> fucking hot.</p><p>And it didn’t help the way she laid out with her arms tossed above her head, the shirt still on over her arms and shoulders. She could easily picture her like this, sprawled out underneath her on a proper bed, waiting for her to touch her, to kiss her, to-</p><p>“Your drink, madam.”</p><p>Agatha blinked and looked to where the blue polo guy stood with her own piña colada. She took it with an awkward smile, before dropping down to sit on the spare sunbed.</p><p>Rio turned her head to look at her. “So, you like Sappho?”</p><p>Agatha eyed her suspiciously. “Have you been googling me? Because if that’s news to you, I’m kind of disappointed in your observational skills. Of course I like Sappho. I’m both an English professor and a raging dyke.”</p><p>“Agatha!” Lilia gasped. “You know how I feel about that word!”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but she was admittedly relieved that was all Rio had found of interest when googling her name. There were <em>much </em>worse things that could have popped up.</p><p>“I read one of your papers,” Rio admitted. “It was really good. I’m intrigued mostly in the fragments themselves, though. Just think buried somewhere there could be more, and we might never find them. And if it is all really gone, what does that say about our own mortality? How many great writers and artists left a legacy of work that should have made them live forever, only for it to be lost to the ages? Like Shakespeare. How easily could he have been forgotten? How long will it be until we’re all lost to history?”</p><p>“Jeez Rio,” Jen commented. “Way to bring down the mood.”</p><p>“Sorry. It just got me thinking.”</p><p>“This is what she’s like when she’s drunk,” Alice commented. “Very philosophical.”</p><p>Agatha eyed Rio’s drink suspiciously. “How many of those have you had?”</p><p>Rio took an innocent sip. “Only two.”</p><p>“That’s her third,” Lilia helpfully supplied.</p><p>Rio just took another sip. “I love piña coladas.”</p><p>“Oh, I can tell.” Agatha took a sip of her own. In Rio’s defence, it was very good. “After this one, we’re going onto orange juice.”</p><p>Rio gave her a two-finger salute. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head and lay out on the sunbed, trying very hard to hide her smile.</p><p> </p><p>True to her word, Rio stopped after that piña colada, as did Alice. Jen and Lilia, however, continued on to the point Lilia giggled all the way back to the villa and Alice had to practically carry Jen most of the way. Agatha, of course, found that highly amusing, and despite the circumstances, Rio was glad to see her finally enjoying herself.</p><p>Alice threw together some pasta, plain for Jen while the others had it with a jarred marinara sauce Lilia’s housekeeper had left for them. They chatted for a while and watched the sunset, before Lilia and Jen decided to call it a night, Agatha shouting teasing comments after them as they went. Alice stayed for a while, before excusing herself to ‘check on Jen’.</p><p>Then Rio was alone with Agatha, who watched her as she sipped a glass of red wine.</p><p>“So, shall we go over the bathroom rules?”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Bathroom rules?”</p><p>“Yes, to avoid any embarrassment or mishaps.”</p><p>“Oh right.” Rio shrugged. “Sure.”</p><p>Agatha set her wineglass down. “For starters, we never use each other’s doors, unless we need to speak to each other then we’ll knock and wait for a reply.”</p><p>“That’s a given.” Rio would never go in Agatha’s room without asking.</p><p>“When the bathroom is in use, we lock both sides. The doors must stay shut when you’re not in there, and we must knock to make sure the other person isn’t in there.”</p><p>“Okay.”</p><p>“And keep it clean and tidy.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha picked up her wine again. “How long are you staying for?”</p><p>“I’m planning to stay for as long as I can,” Rio answered honestly. “It’s only an hour plane journey to Rome. I can fly back and forth if I need to.”</p><p>“For someone who preaches about the environment, you certainly rack up those air miles. Or do you only care about Australian fish?”</p><p>“Australian fish?”</p><p>She noticed Agatha tense, before taking a large gulp of wine. “Yes, you think we’re killing them all.”</p><p>Rio wracked her brain, before she realised what Agatha was referencing to. “Oh, you’ve seen the video from that conference?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, avoiding her gaze. “It was very, erm, interesting.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I tried, but I was so nervous that it sounded like a blabbering mess.”</p><p>“No, I thought it sounded good.” Agatha downed the rest of her wine. “I think I’m going to head to bed too. You coming?”</p><p>Rio stared back at her.</p><p>“Not like that,” Agatha quickly corrected. “I mean…”</p><p>“I know,” Rio assured. “You go ahead. I’ll make sure everything is locked up and cleared away.”</p><p>“Okay, well goodnight then.”</p><p>“Goodnight.” Rio watched as Agatha headed upstairs before getting to work doing the dishes. She could practically hear Lilia’s protests, but she didn’t mind. She preferred to do things herself, then at least she knew they were done and done properly.</p><p>Once everything was washed, dried, and back in their proper place, she made sure all the doors and windows were locked before heading up to her room.</p><p>She had partly unpacked before heading to the beach, so it was easy for her to find and change into some sleep shorts and a vest. Picking up her toothbrush and toiletry bag, she knocked on the bathroom door.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>There was no reply, so she tried the door and found it was unlocked. Cautiously, she pushed it open, relieved to find it was indeed vacant.</p><p>Agatha’s stuff was scattered around the small space. Her hair products and bodywash were in the shower/bath, her toiletries around the sink, and her swimsuit was left to dry on towel rack. Rio made sure not to disturb anything and went through her nightly routine before retreating out of no-man’s land back to her own territory.</p><p>She lay down in bed and set her phone to charge on her bedside cabinet, certain the sun would wake her before any alarm would. She went to turn off the lamp, only for her hand to hesitate just shy of the switch.</p><p>Stealing a cautious look towards the bathroom door, she slowly pulled open the cabinet draw. Reaching inside, she pulled out the violet velvet box that lay within, and lifted the lid to reveal the glistening lilac sapphire.</p><p>Rio smiled at its beauty, and once again imagined how it would look on Agatha’s left ring finger. A symbol for all to see, representing the promise to spend the rest of their lives together.</p><p>She put it back safely into the draw before switching off the lamp and settling back against the pillows.</p><p>When Agatha gave the word, she would be ready. Yet first, she had to win her heart, and Rio was most definitely up for a challenge.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha woke up the next morning with a pained groan. Her skin was still sore from the day before and she’d somehow managed to sleep awkwardly on her arm, jarring her shoulder.</p><p>With a groan, she pulled herself out of bed and staggered to the bathroom, only to find it locked. She banged on the door. “Rio, let me in!”</p><p>“Just finishing up,” Rio called back. “I’ll be done in a moment!”</p><p>“No, now!”</p><p>“Agatha, I’ll be as quick as I can!”</p><p>“What are you doing?” Agatha demanded.</p><p>“I’m just getting ready to go by the pool.”</p><p>“Open this damn door now!”</p><p>She heard the lock click and she quickly pushed the door open, ready to rant angrily about the bathroom rules she herself had come up with. Yet the sight before her stopped her right in her tracks.</p><p>Rio. In the most sinfully gorgeous swimsuit she’d ever seen.</p><p>It was black, the material looped around the back of her neck by two straps that didn’t meet until just above her belly button. Two gold hoops and a small decorative disk kept the two straps in place, yet still displayed the sun-kissed curve of her breasts. A white and orange shawl tied around her waist, while her hair was tied back loosely, her newly acquired bangs framing her gorgeous face. A gorgeous face that looked back at her with concern.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>She quickly cleared her throat. “You look nice.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio smiled. “You look cute too.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her sleep shirt and shorts with shame. “Thanks.”</p><p>Rio applied some lotion to her face before stepping back from the vanity. “All done. I’ll meet you downstairs?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and watched as Rio left the bathroom. Once the door shut, she quickly locked it before cupping her face with her hands.</p><p>What the fuck was she going to do?</p><p>She hadn’t watched the video last night like she had every other for nearly two months, not with Rio just an adjoining bathroom away. But it seemed her obsession had conditioned her clit to the sound of Rio’s voice, so she had spent nearly half an hour thinking about every titillating sexual fantasy she had filled away to no avail. Until, in her desperation, her mind went a different way:</p><p>Rio’s voice, Rio in a bikini, Rio’s perky butt cheeks, Rio’s coconut sunscreen, Rio looking fucking gorgeous, Rio, Rio, Rio.</p><p>The pleasure had hit her so hard she’d had to bite her pillow to keep quiet.</p><p>She had laid there afterwards in shame. A part of had missed the person she was when she first met Rio, when she was adamant she had no interest in that bizarre woman and could function perfectly well without her. Yet she also wished to know the future her. In a year, two years. To know how this strange chapter of her life would end. It was on a fantasy of such that she fond herself carried away into a peaceful slumber.</p><p>Then, after seeing Rio like<em> that</em> as soon as she woke up, her mind hypnotised by her beauty while her body burned with desire, she knew she was a total lost cause.</p><p>And so it was then, while stood alone in that shared bathroom, she made her decision.</p><p>She needed to sleep with Rio.</p><p>As soon as possible.</p><p> </p><p>Rio looked out over the ocean, the light breeze cooling the scorching heat from the summer sun.</p><p>The view was magical, with the edges of the Sicilian cliffs standing strong against the shimmering sea that stretched beyond the horizon. She could see why Lilia had chosen it as her second home, and why Nat and Yelena had wanted to open a hotel there. A part of her wished she too could had invested in her own Vidal Resort in the area. But she wasn’t there to work. She was there to win over the love of her life. </p><p>She tried to not be too hopeful about the way Agatha had looked at her in the bathroom, but she couldn’t help it. Not when the signs all pointed in the right direction. She just had to be patient, and kind, and wait for Agatha to be ready.</p><p>Then, their lives could finally begin.</p><p>“Ah, there you are.”</p><p>Rio looked round to see Alice walking towards her, two glasses of iced tea in her hands. She handed one over before joining her to admire the view.</p><p>“Where’s everyone?” Rio asked. “I thought they would be by the pool?”</p><p>“Jen is getting her outfit selection ready for tonight, Agatha is eating a croissant, and Lilia went down to the hotel.”</p><p>Rio sighed. “I knew I shouldn’t have put her on the VIP list.”</p><p>“She’s getting her nails done,” Alice assured. “Jen and I are meeting her after for coffee if you want to join?”</p><p>“Is Agatha going?”</p><p>“We can ask.” Alice took a sip of her drink. “How’s that going by the way?”</p><p>“Good, I think.”</p><p>“So, no closer to getting her down the aisle?”</p><p>“Not in the relationship side of things, no.”</p><p>“What does that mean?” Alice’s eyes narrowed. “Rio, what did you do?”</p><p>“Nothing bad.” Rio took a sip of her iced tea. “I was just walking through Rome minding my own business and I may have stumbled upon a ring…”</p><p>“A ring?!”</p><p>Rio quickly shushed her. “It’s not what you think, okay! It’s THE ring. I knew it the moment I saw it. If I have to wait twenty years, or never use it at all, it doesn’t matter.”</p><p>“Of course it fucking matters!” Alice hissed. “This is insane, Rio! You aren’t even dating yet!”</p><p>“I know, but…”</p><p>“Okay, I’ve had enough. You need to ask her out or something. Be proactive or whatever, because I can’t deal with the suspense any longer.”</p><p>“How about you and Jen?” Rio countered. “You haven’t asked her to be your girlfriend yet?”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. “That’s different.”</p><p>“How? You clearly like her.”</p><p>“I know, but…”</p><p>“But?”</p><p>Alice scowled. “Fine. Watch and learn, Vidal!”</p><p>“What do you-”</p><p>“I’ve chosen my dress!” Jen announced as she stepped outside, wearing a sheer pink cover-up over her bikini. “I can’t wait for tonight!”</p><p>Alice handed Rio her drink before stepping towards Jen. “Hey Jen, can I ask you something?”</p><p>“Sure, what’s up?”</p><p>“Well, I was wondering if you would possibly ever consider potentially being my, erm, girlfriend?”</p><p>There was a stretch of silence, and Rio waited tensely for one of them to do something, say something, but the silence went on, and on, and on, and…</p><p>Then the silence was shattered by a scream.</p><p>“YOU FINALLY ASKED ME!” Jen practically threw herself into Alice’s arms.</p><p>Alice looked uncertain. “So is that a yes?”</p><p>“OF COURSE IT’S A YES!” Jen pulled Alice into a deep kiss. “I was waiting for you to take the hint!”</p><p>“Why didn’t you ask her?” Rio interrupted, but Jen waved her off.</p><p>“I don’t ask people out, Rio. People ask me out, though I was about to break that rule for this one.”</p><p>Alice kissed Jen once, and Rio smiled as she witnessed her best friend’s happiness. Soon, her own source of happiness stormed out of the house in a robe and flip flops.</p><p>“What’s all the screaming about, Kale?”</p><p>“Alice asked me to be her girlfriend!” Jen grinned. “</p><p>“Wow, I guess love is in the air.” Agatha looked to Rio and gave her a quick wink, before heading back inside.</p><p>Alice broke away from Jen long enough to give Rio a challenging look. Her friend had certainly led by example, and the result had been more than worth the risk. Yet any risk, no matter how small, was not worth losing Agatha. She was on the right track, and she just had to stay in line a little longer.</p><p>Though perhaps a little assertiveness never hurt anyone.</p><p> </p><p>To Agatha’s relief, Alice and Jen headed out to meet Lilia, taking their lovestruck activity away from the villa. It also, however, left her with an opportunity. </p><p>Now it was just her, a luscious villa by the sea, and Rio Vidal. </p><p>Rio had decided not to go for coffee almost as soon as Agatha said she wanted to stay. It hadn’t been subtle in the slightest, but it worked in her favour. Now she had Rio all to herself, exactly how she wanted her.</p><p>Agatha observed her from her sunbed, watching as she swam lengths of the pool. Rio was a strong swimmer, and she couldn’t help but admire the muscles in her arms as she pushed forward through the water.</p><p>When Rio was done, she swam gently to the edge before climbing out like some kind of Bond girl vixen. </p><p>Agatha bit her lip. She’d never wanted anyone so much in her entire life. </p><p>Rio wiped the water from her face and flashed her a radiant smile. “Lilia really chose this place well. That pool is amazing!”</p><p>“Wow, that’s high praise coming from you.”</p><p>Rio chucked as she settled on the sunbed beside Agatha’s. “Indeed.”</p><p>They lay there side by side for a while, the only sound the birds, the sea, the breeze in the trees. Agatha stole glances Rio’s way, watching as pool water slowly dried on Rio’s skin, shimmering in the sunlight. </p><p>Right, that was enough.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You know you said you’d do anything I’d ask you to?”</p><p>“Within reason,” Rio corrected. “Like I won’t bulldoze the Amazon for you.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Yes, I know that, but if I asked you to do something would you do it?”</p><p>Rio took off her sunglasses. “What do you want?”</p><p>There it was. Rio. Ready. Eager. </p><p>All she’d have to do was say the words, and Rio would do it. Rio would do anything for her (besides destroying the environment which she guessed was fair enough). So there it was, exactly what she wanted. All she had to do was ask.</p><p>“Can you grab me a drink?”</p><p>Rio got up without hesitation. “A coke?”</p><p>“That would be perfect.”</p><p>“Okay then I’ll be right back, m’lady.” Rio smirked at her before heading back into the house, offering a <em>great</em> view as she went. </p><p>Agatha sighed in defeat. She couldn’t do it. Not like that. It just…didn’t feel right. </p><p>She had to think of another plan.</p><p>A plan of seduction. </p><p>She arranged herself on the sunbed for Rio’s return, arm thrown above her head, her back slightly arched to exaggerate her chest. She topped her head back and closed her eyes, ready and waiting. </p><p>It may not work straight away, but she hoped giving Rio enough <em>visual stimulation </em>would get something to happen. Rio was only human, after all.</p><p>She heard footsteps approaching and smirked. “Got me that drink already? Perhaps you need a reward.”</p><p>“Ew, no thank you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes shot open, and she found Jen stood over her with a look of disgust. “What the fuck, Jen?”</p><p>“Me? I’m not the one laid out like Rose getting her portrait done.”</p><p>“Baby, where are you?” Alice’s voice called from the noise.</p><p>“Out here hosing Agatha down,” Jen answered. </p><p>Agatha huffed and folded her arms. Of course these idiots had to come back and ruin everything.</p><p>Alice appeared with Rio by her side, the latter moving over to give Agatha a cool can of Coke. “This okay?” </p><p>Agatha accepted the can. “Great. Thanks.”</p><p>Rio gave her a smile before looking to Alice. “Four-lap race?”</p><p>“Oh you’re on!” </p><p>They both jumped into the pool, and Agatha cackled as Jen was caught in the splash. </p><p>Karma was a bitch. </p><p> </p><p>Rio looked herself over in the mirror. After a day of lounging and fun, it was time to get ready for their dinner reservation at the hotel. </p><p>She’d put on a nice white dress with gold navy-style buttons. One that showed a good amount of leg and silhouetted her figure perfectly while also having a level of class. A level of seriousness that she needed to see her plan through.</p><p>“Okay Agatha,” she practiced in the mirror. “I want to talk about us. And I know what you said about the proposal and you telling me when, and I totally get that. I just want to ask if maybe, possibly you’d consider going on a date with me? A proper one this time. You, me, some local food. What do you say?”</p><p>She stared at her reflection for a few more moments before her shoulders slumped in defeat. </p><p>No matter how many times she practiced, it just didn’t sound right. Maybe it was a sign for her to leave it. That nothing would go well with her messing with it. Just wait, be patient, be hopeful.</p><p>A bang on her bedroom door interrupted her thoughts.</p><p>“Get moving, Vidal,” Alice called through, and Rio grabbed her clutch bag on her way out of her room.</p><p>The others waited downstairs. Lilia was dressed in her usual extravagant attire, Jen in her signature pinks, Alice in her summer festival garb and Agatha…Well, Agatha looked like a goddess.</p><p>She wore a long dress with a pattern of blacks, greens and whites. Tropical, but subtle. And Rio particularly liked how low Agatha had left the buttons open.</p><p>Jen whistled. “Very slick, Vidal. I’m starting to see the millions now.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. “Let’s go.”</p><p>When they made it to the hotel dining room, Rio had to give her friends credit. It was a beautiful set-up. Everything a standard white, with dark wooden chairs, the décor simple but leaning to the gorgeous location, all tying together with a large window that looked out onto the sea. Close to perfection.</p><p>They were led to their table and given the menus for the evening. Rio was pleased to see some vegetarian options, and everyone seemed happy enough. Well, all except for Agatha.</p><p>Agatha was quiet. Uncharacteristically so. Sure she added to the conversation every so often, but she seemed…distant. Lost in her thoughts. Rio wanted to climb into her head and see what was bothering her, to see if she could help, or simply exist there for a while. There is no place she’d rather get lost than in Agatha Harkness’s mind.</p><p>“So we are definitely booking in a spa day,” Lilia concluded as they waited for their starters to arrive. “What other amenities can we take full advantage of?”</p><p>“Well, we can go back to the beach,” Rio suggested. “Then there’s all the usual stuff. Pool, gym, tennis courts.”</p><p>“I could do with a gym day.” Alice flexed her arm muscle. “Don’t want to lose the boys.”</p><p>“Yes, definitely the gym,” Jen agreed. “Maybe the gym one day then the spa the next?”</p><p>“Good thinking,” Lilia agreed. “As long as that’s okay with everyone?”</p><p>Rio was ready to answer yes, when something brushed her thigh.</p><p>A hand.</p><p>Agatha’s hand.</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha questioningly. Had that been an accident?</p><p>Agatha just smirked and did it again, this time a little further to the hem of her skirt.</p><p>“What do you think, Rio?” Alice asked. “Should we book the tennis court tomorrow or the day after?”</p><p>“Whenever you want,” Rio answered, trying to keep her cool while being acutely aware of Agatha’s hand stroking her skin. “Either way, I’ll win.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “How confident.”</p><p>“She’s annoyingly good,” Alice grumbled. “All those years living in hotel resorts.”</p><p>“How about we do doubles then?” Jen suggested. “Lilia can umpire, me and Alice verses Rio and Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha started drawing light circles into Rio’s skin. “Don’t you remember I won the term tennis champion at school?”</p><p>“You didn’t win the year one, though.”</p><p>“Because I wasn’t there a year. If I had been, I’d have won it easily.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid even higher.</p><p>“You don’t know that,” Jen accused, and Agatha barked with laughter.</p><p>“Please. Eleanor won it. I could wipe the floor with her.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers traced the edge of her skirt.</p><p>“She’d have got you disqualified for something,” Jen argued. “She’s a spiteful bitch sometimes.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingertips teased with the material.</p><p>“Sometimes?” Agatha questioned. “More like all times.”</p><p>Agatha’s began to slide further up, until…</p><p>…Rio’s phone buzzed in her bag.</p><p>With a frustrated huff, she quickly checked who it was, only for her heart to drop.</p><p>No, this couldn’t be happening. Not now.</p><p>“Sorry,” she said as she stood. “I have to take this.”</p><p>“Is everything okay?” Alice asked with concern, and Rio plastered on a smile.</p><p>“Yeah probably. I’ll be back in a moment.”</p><p>Once she left the table, she answered the call, knowing exactly how it was going to end.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha went to find her. She’d been gone a good ten minutes, and their starters had already arrived. She found Rio stood outside, pacing with the phone pressed to her ear.</p><p>“Yes, that’ll do,” Rio said into the phone. “Thanks, Billy. Speak to you soon.”</p><p>When Rio put the phone down, Agatha stepped towards her.</p><p>“Hey, everything okay?”</p><p>“It will be,” Rio answered stiffly. “Why are you outside?”</p><p>“To see you,” Agatha answered. “What’s happened?”</p><p>“Nothing, it’s just…” Rio sighed, her shoulders slumped. “I have to go back to Rome. I have a flight booked for the morning.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha couldn’t believe it. Wouldn’t believe it. “Why?”</p><p>“Some legal stuff. Nothing bad but I have to be there in person. I should be back the following morning, though.”</p><p>A day without Rio.</p><p>Agatha didn’t want that.</p><p>“You’ve barely been here two days. Can’t you put it off?”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Would if I could, but it’s time sensitive.”</p><p>“Right.” Agatha suddenly hated the Vidal legal team. With a burning fucking passion.</p><p>“Agatha, I-” Rio began, but stopped herself. Agatha watched her take a deep breath before continuing. “Look, this is totally ridiculous, but I was wondering if you would maybe like to come with me?”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows. “You want me to come to Rome?”</p><p>“Yes. I mean if you want to…”</p><p>“Yes.” The word was out of her mouth before she could stop it. “I’ll come to Rome.”</p><p>Rio’s entire face lit up. “Really?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Please, like I’d refuse seeing this damn hotel of yours.”</p><p>Rio grinned from ear to ear as she tapped away at her phone. “I need to get you another ticket. Hold on…” She brought the phone to her ear. “Billy, book another seat for Agatha, please…….Yes, really!”</p><p>It was crazy, Agatha knew. A whirlwind trip to Rome with the woman she wanted so damn badly. Yet she’d already flown to fucking Sicily.</p><p>How would Rome make any difference?</p>

<p>Agatha sat in the window seat, looking out at the land below. It was just over an hours flight between Sicily and Rome, and they were about to reach their destination.</p><p>Rio sat beside her, flipping through a magazine. Agatha stole a glance her way. It was so annoying how cute she looked in a simple t shirt and slacks- not exactly business attire but she guessed Rio was rich enough to arrive at work wearing Snoopy pyjamas and no one would dare question it. </p><p>“So what’s the plan for today?” Agatha asked. “I’m guessing you’ll be busy.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “We’ll go straight to the hotel we’re staying at to drop off our bags, then I want to show you the soon-to-be Vidal hotel, though there’s not much to see yet. Then I’ll let you go explore by yourself. I’ll call you when I’m done, then we can carry on together. I also took the liberty of booking dinner tonight, if that’s okay with you?”</p><p>“Absolutely fine.” In fact, it was perfect. An intimate meal for two in one of the most romantic cities in the world? Oh she was so getting laid. </p><p>“You can finally see the Trevi Fountain,” Rio said with a grin. “Though you’ll have to fight your way through a crowd.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “I’m sure I’ll manage.” </p><p>Rio gave her a shy smile. “Thank you for coming with me.”</p><p>“Shouldn’t I be thanking you? You’re taking to Rome!”</p><p>“I know, but I appreciate the company. It can get quite lonely, you know.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in understanding. “Well, I’m more than happy to be your travel companion.”</p><p>Rio’s face lit up, and Agatha felt an uncomfortable twist in her gut. Okay, that sounded a little too sweet. No, she needed to be cool. Seductive. The object of Rio’s deepest desires. Only then would she get her to cross the line.</p><p>They soon touched down at Fiumicino Airport, and Rio turned off her airplane mode as soon as the wheels were securely on the ground. She looked at her notifications and sighed.</p><p>“Sorry, I need to make a quick call.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “They couldn’t be without you for an hour, huh?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “They get very needy when there’s a problem.”</p><p>Agatha looked to her own phone. The only message she’d had was from Jen and that was just her complaining-</p><p>“Hey, Honey.”</p><p>Her head snapped up. <em>Honey?</em></p><p>Rio chuckled. “We’ve only just touched down, so we’ll be there soon.”</p><p>A long pause, and Agatha watched her intensely. Who the fuck was she talking to? And why was she calling them <em>honey?</em></p><p>“Alright, Honey. See you soon.” Rio put the phone down and sighed. “This hotel better be worth it. I swear it’s been a while since I’ve had such a stressful project.” </p><p>“I’m sure it’ll be fine,” Agatha assured. “You know what you’re doing.”</p><p>“I hope so.” Rio offered her another smile. “At least we have tonight to look forward to.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. Oh yes, they would certainly have a night to remember. No matter who this ‘<em>honey</em>’ was.</p><p> </p><p>Once they’d gotten through security, Rio refusing to let Agatha carry her overnight bag, they made their way through to arrivals. There, they found a tall man in a suit holding a sign reading <strong>VIDAL </strong>in big block letters. Agatha stood aside while Rio greeted him in Italian, before looking back to her with yet another dazzling smile. “Our ride is here.”</p><p>The ride in question was a vintage two-seat Ferrari convertible, its body shining while it’s paint remained a striking red. Another man in a suit stood guarding it while people stopped and stared. When Rio approached, he reached into his pocket and pulled out a set of keys.</p><p>“Bentornato, Signora.”</p><p>“Grazie, Raph,” Rio replied before moving to open the passenger door. “Your carriage, m’lady.”</p><p>Agatha settled into the leather seat while Rio put their bags in the trunk, before she took her place behind the wheel. She put on her sunglasses and started up the engine, the hum smooth but strong. Rio gave the men a finger salute before she set off.</p><p>“It’s a bit of a ride,” Rio admitted as they headed in the direction of the city. She reached over and switched on the radio. “It’ll be worth it, though.”</p><p>The ride down the highway was pretty smooth, and Agatha reclined in her seat, enjoying the sunshine and the air flowing through her hair as the little red car sped forward. It was relaxing, serene even. Better than Jen’s mindfulness bullshit.</p><p>That changed, however, when they reached the city limits. The streets got busier, but also narrower. Cars beeped as vespa mopeds weaved through the traffic, and people walked out at crossings with little warning. Rio seemed unfazed and simply laughed to herself.</p><p>“Can you see why I did so much walking?”</p><p>Agatha definitely could.</p><p>The lack of speed meant the summer heat was sticking to her skin, and the sudden stopping and starting was growing tedious. Yet as they got further into the city, her attention was captured by other things. Churches and status, fancy stores and cute little cafes. She couldn’t wait to explore, though she wished she’d have Rio with her the whole time.</p><p>She just had to hope they’d make up for it that night.</p><p>Rio pulled up outside a grand, golden-bricked hotel. It stood on a corner, taking up most of both streets, perfectly pruned trees lining the sidewalk outside and the Italian flag flying proud above the main entrance.</p><p>While Agatha had been marvelling, Rio had gotten out of the car and had opened the door for her. “Here we are.”</p><p>Agatha got out and went to help Rio get their bags out, only for a bellhop to materialise at their side, taking the bags and greeting Rio in Italian. Whatever he said made her laugh and she swatted him playfully on the arm.</p><p>Another man in a stylish suit also approached them and greeted Rio with a handshake.</p><p>“Welcome back, Ms Vidal. Shall I park it in your usual place?”</p><p>“That would be fantastic, Luca. Thank you.” Rio handed him her eyes and some cash. “For always being so lovely.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. Sure Rio had been there a long time, but had she really gone and befriended everyone who worked there?</p><p>The man smiled, captured by Rio’s charm, before he climbed into the Ferrari and drove off.</p><p>The bellhop walked beside them with their bags as they headed inside.</p><p>“Matt, this is Agatha. Agatha, this is Matt. He sucks at poker.”</p><p>“Ah Agatha,” he said with a grin. “You are here with Rio now?”</p><p>“Only for tonight,” Rio explained. “We fly back to Sicily in the morning.”</p><p>Matt seemed disappointed. “You will be back though?”</p><p>“Of course. I have the room booked for a year.”</p><p>That was news to Agatha. A year? Surely she wouldn’t be kept here that long. It was only meant to be a few weeks!</p><p>“Good,” Matt said as his smile returned. “I want a rematch. Maybe with Agatha this time?”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Oh, you don’t want to play poker with me, young man. I never lose.”</p><p>“Then we definitely have to,” Rio insisted. “Because <em>I</em> never lose either.”</p><p>“Fine, but you’ll both regret it,” Agatha insisted. “This is your formal warning.”</p><p>They walked through the lobby, and while Agatha stopped near the check-in desk, Rio and Matt carried on in the direction of the elevators.</p><p>“Don’t we need to check in?” Agatha asked, making Rio look back at her with a frown.</p><p>“No, we’re staying in my suite.”</p><p>Woah, woah, woah. They were sharing a room? Agatha had to bite back a grin. Oh, everything was certainly going to plan.</p><p>They went to the top floor, and Rio led the way down the corridor to the room at the very end. She opened the door, and the three of them stepped inside. Matt placed the bags by the door, before bidding them a good day, shutting the suite door behind him.</p><p>Rio looked to her and smiled. “Here we are.”</p><p>Agatha looked around the suite with wide eyes. This wasn’t a hotel room. It was a luxury fucking penthouse.</p><p>“Rio, this place is bigger than my apartment.”</p><p>“Well for now it’s my home away from home.” Rio walked through the living area and opened an adjoining door. “This is your room. Mine is just opposite. We still have to share a bathroom, though.”</p><p>So <em>technically </em>not sharing a room, but it was something she could work with.</p><p>Agatha picked up her bag. “I’m just going to freshen up. What time do you want to head to your hotel?”</p><p>“We have plenty of time. It’s only a short walk.”</p><p>Agatha nodded and headed into her room. In it was a king-sized bed and she quickly flopped down onto it. Sometimes she missed the luxuries of her youth, though she and her mother had never lived the way Rio did. Her mother had always been about status, while Rio seemed to selfishly splurge on experiences rather than things she could gain. Like driving through Rome in a convertible and jetting back and forth to Sicily to spend time with someone she was trying to court.</p><p>Comparing her mother to Rio would be impossible. Because Rio was nothing like her mother. She was kind and smart and thoughtful and funny and interesting…no, no, no. That went beyond desire. She just wanted to sleep with Rio because she was hot. Not because she has actual feelings for her, because that would be…that would be ridiculous. </p><p>Agatha sat up, stopping her thoughts from wandering too far in the wrong direction. She quickly unpacked her things and freshened up, ready for a day of exploring.</p><p>When she walked back out into the living area, Rio was sat on the couch, once again on the phone.</p><p>“Make sure you have the plans ready for when we arrive, including the concept images.” Rio stole a glance up at her and smiled. “Honey, I need to go. See you soon.”</p><p>There it was again. <em>Honey. </em>It made Agatha’s jaw tighten.</p><p>Rio stood and shoved her phone in her jeans pocket. “Ready to go?” </p><p>Agatha smirked. “Lead the way, Ms Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p>The hotel was…not what she expected. </p><p>It looked like any other building. Nothing exciting or spectacular. Just another old apartment building lost within the city. Yet Rio looked up at it as though it were a palace and excitedly took her hand to lead her inside. </p><p>“This is it!”</p><p>Agatha didn’t pull away, just smiled to herself as they walked into the lobby. Or what would be the lobby. Currently, it was all tarp and bare flooring. </p><p>“It’s a work in progress,” Rio explained. “But when I show you the concept plans, you’ll hopefully be able to see what it’ll become.”</p><p>Agatha hoped so, because she currently was only seeing a building site.</p><p>Rapid footsteps echoed through the old building, and soon a young woman came into view. She was young and of course pretty, with curly hair and full lips that were pulled in a wide smile, an iPad clutched to her chest like it was precious treasure. </p><p>“Rio!” She exclaimed. “You’re really back!”</p><p>Rio kept hold of Agatha’s hand but greeted the girl with a half-hug. “I’ve only been gone two days”.</p><p>“Two days too long!” The girl’s eyes then drifted to Agatha. Deep blue met deep blue, and something akin to hatred boiled in Agatha’s chest. “And who’s this?”</p><p>“Agatha, this is Honey,” Rio introduced. “My project assistant and the person who’s kept me organized these past few months.”</p><p>Ah. That explained it. </p><p>“You’re Agatha?” The girl quickly held out her hand. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you.”</p><p>Agatha forced a smile and shook her hand. She already hated her with a burning passion.</p><p>“Did you get me the plans?” Rio asked and Honey <em>oh so helpfully</em> handed over the iPad.</p><p>“It’s on there, boss.” <em>Honey’s </em>eyes drifted to Agatha once more. “Rio’s vision is truly unbelievable. I can’t wait to see it when everything is done.”</p><p>“Well, she does have a great eye.” Agatha moved her free hand and rested it on Rio’s upper arm. “I’m sure it’ll be stunning, just like her.”</p><p>Rio laughed shyly, bowing her head as a blush formed on her cheeks. Agatha smiled to herself and stole a glance Honey’s way, finding that now it was the girl’s smile that was forced.</p><p>“I’ll come find you when we’re done with the tour,” Rio told Honey, who nodded eagerly.</p><p>“I’ll wait for you in your office.”</p><p>Agatah watched the girl go with a look of disgust. Could she not see she was holding Rio’s fucking hand?</p><p>“Are you ready?” Rio asked and Agatha nodded, squeezing Rio’s hand in the process.</p><p>“Show me your <em>vision</em>, Ms Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio loved this.</p><p>Walking through a renovating hotel with Agatha at her side, describing her vision through each room they passed. It was like her own slice of heaven.</p><p>And Agatha seemed interested enough, asking questions and making comments on the plans. Mostly praising, but she did make a few critics. Like how she should go with mirror tiles in the bar to reflect the ceiling mosaic rather than adding more unnecessary colour, and to not be cautious with the contrast art deco/roman features.</p><p>“It contrasts nostalgia with history,” Agatha explained. “Like stepping straight into <em>Roman Holiday</em>.”</p><p>Rio had fallen even deeper in love with her the moment she said that.</p><p>“So, what do you think?” she asked as they walked back towards the lobby.</p><p>“I see why you chose this place. The building’s features are fascinating. What was it before it was a hotel?”</p><p>“A mansion, then a school. We were lucky the original features haven’t been too tampered with. It tells the story of the building and gives it a uniqueness that will hopefully give guests an experience they won’t forget.”</p><p>Agatha linked arms with her, and Rio couldn’t help but savour this new development in their friendship. One she herself had accidentally initiated in her excitement, but was pleased Agatha was actively continuing it.</p><p>“I may need you to come interior design my apartment. Make it all cool and sophisticated.”</p><p>“You know I’ll have no notes,” Rio said positively. “But I would like to visit your apartment when we’re both back in New York.”</p><p>“It’s a date then,” Agatha answered, and Rio couldn’t help but beam.</p><p>Soon enough, they were back in the lobby, and Rio knew it was time to (temporary) part ways.</p><p>“Do you need me to send someone with you? The city is a bit of a labyrinth.”</p><p>“I’m sure Google Maps will help,” Agatha assured. “How long will you be?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I’ll call you.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I’ll see you soon then.”</p><p>“As soon as possible,” Rio promised. “Make sure to take lots of photos.”</p><p>She watched Agatha head out onto the street, wishing she could go with her. However, she had work to do, and so she headed in the direction of her office.</p><p>Someday soon, it would be the hotel managers office, but for now it was her base of operations. Bare, impersonal, the definition of temporary.</p><p>As always, Honey was sat on the edge of the desk, smiling brightly when she entered.</p><p>“Tour all done?”</p><p>Rio nodded, handing the iPad back before sitting down behind her desk. “Thanks for that.”</p><p>“Anytime, boss.” Honey sat down in the chair opposite her. “So what did she think?”</p><p>“She liked it. By the way, I want to lean more into the art deco- Ancient Rome vibe. Agatha said it would make a striking contrast.”</p><p>Honey tilted her head. “But we want to avoid looking too tacky.”</p><p>“It won’t look tacky,” Rio assured. “Agatha has a good eye.”</p><p>“She isn’t what I expected, you know,” Honey commented. “I pictured someone, l don’t know, younger.”</p><p>Rio didn’t like the comment, but she knew Honey meant no harm. She had been a good friend to her during her time in Rome, and like with everyone, she had spoken about Agatha often. It was no surprise Honey had created a vision of her in her mind. </p><p>“She’s hopefully going to round here a lot more,” Rio manifested. “We’re good friends now.”</p><p>“So what are you two doing tonight?” Honey asked. “Going somewhere special?”</p><p>“I hope it will be.” Rio looked over her schedule. “Do you know how long this meeting will take?”</p><p>“They’ve asked for an hour.”</p><p>Rio nodded. She would give them an hour, and then she would return to Agatha. Until then, she had work to do.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was irritable. There were too many people, too many beeping cars, and the sun was getting too damn hot.</p><p>She tried to see the Trevi Fountain, but when she saw the size of the crowd, she quickly retreated. She wasn’t in the mood for it anyway. Not when her mind was fixed on other things.</p><p>On Rio, and her <em>helpful</em> project assistant. Meeting alone in her office, with Little Miss Honey fluttering her eyelashes. </p><p>Agatha didn’t know why it bothered her so much. Rio declared she wanted to marry her just after they met. Said they were soulmates and that she had waited her whole life to meet her. Honey didn’t compare. Though there was the part of her mind that worried she had pushed Rio away, successfully friend-zoned, and that Rio might find solace in the willing arms of her young, pretty assistant. She couldn’t let that happen. Not when they were so close to something happening. </p><p>After retracing her steps, Agatha found herself stood back in the lobby of Rio’s hotel. She hated being that girl, but desperate times called for desperate measures. She pulled out her phone and sent Rio a message.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Back at your hotel. Waiting for you in the lobby</em>
</p><p>She was waiting for her to reply when she heard someone clear her throat. High pitched. Kind of bitchy. She knew exactly who it was before she looked up.</p><p>Honey stood in front of her, smiling at her sweetly. “You’re back so soon?” </p><p>Agatha forced a smile. “What can I say? I missed my girl too much.”</p><p>“Rio?” Honey questioned. “She’s still busy I’m afraid. Her meeting ran over and now she needs to finish up some paperwork. She probably won’t be ready for some time.”</p><p>“It’s okay. I’ll wait.”</p><p>“I think you’d be better off heading back to your hotel,” Honey advised. “Freshen up for whatever Rio has planned for your evening.”</p><p>Agatha wanted to smack that smile off her smug little face, but instead she doubled down. “That’ll be hard, given Rio has the key to <em>our</em> suite.”</p><p>She noticed Honey’s eyes widen slightly. “Oh right. Well if you want, I can get the key?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to reply when she received a new notification.</p><p>
<strong>RICH LOSER</strong>
</p><p>
<em>come on through to my office!</em>
</p><p>Agatha smirked and put her phone in her bag. “Rio wants me to meet her in her office, so if you’ll excuse me.”</p><p>She walked past her with a smug smile on her face. That put Honey in her place for now.</p><p>She recalled the way to Rio’s temporary office from their tour, and with a light knock, she pushed the door open. Rio was sat behind her desk, a pile of paperwork sat in front of her. She looked up and greeted Agatha with a smile.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha shut the door and sat in the chair opposite her. “How did the meeting go?”</p><p>“It was long, but we got everything sorted. I just need to sign all this and then I’ll be good to go.”</p><p>“Great.” Agatha settled in her chair. “Just pretend I’m not here.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You know that’s impossible for me.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Good. I like having your full and undivided attention, but you have papers to sign.”</p><p>Rio nodded and looked down at the documents, signing where all the sticky tab arrows were, while her eyes danced over the page making sure everything was in order. Agatha scrawled through her phone as she waited, looking up ‘things to see in Rome’ for the umpteenth time. </p><p>Suddenly, Rio spoke up. “Why did you come back so soon? I thought you wanted to see the Trevi fountain?”</p><p>“I tried but it was too crowded. I don’t know. I guess it didn’t feel right doing it by myself.”</p><p>Rio understood. “Well let me finish this and we’ll be on our way!”</p><p>True to her word, Rio completed the paperwork in record time and after handing it to a waiting intern, she declared she was once again on vacation.</p><p>Rio said she was going to pick up their ride and told Agatha to wait outside the main doors. She didn’t know why she couldn’t go get their ‘ride’ with her, but she was getting used to just trusting the process when it came to eccentric millionaires.</p><p>When Rio came zooming into view, breaking to a stop in front of her with a goofy smile plastered on her face, she was neither surprised or impressed.</p><p>“Seriously?” Agatha questioned. “A vespa?”</p><p>“What? It’s the best way to get around!” Rio handed her a helmet. “Hop on!”</p><p>Agatha sighed and accepted the helmet, putting it on before she moved to straddle the bike, wrapping her arms around Rio’s waist. “You better not crash.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “I’ll try my best.”</p><p>It wasn’t the view of Rome Agatha expected. They didn’t go in museums or explore ruins or churches. Instead, Rio showed her Rome by the scenic route. They drove through quaint neighbourhoods, saw Ancient Obelisks, passed striking churches, stopped for gelato, went by the Vatican and the Castel Sant'Angelo, passing by Palatine Hill and the Roman Forum, before circling the colosseum as the sun began to dip in the sky, bathing it in a warm golden glow.</p><p>It was all so beautiful, so magnificent. Agatha never wanted it to end. Yet soon Rio pulled the moped outside of her hotel, and Luca eagerly appeared again to valet it away.</p><p>“Next time I’ll make sure you see more,” Rio promised when they made it up to their suite. “I’ll get colosseum tickets, and we’ll go to the Pantheon, and…”</p><p>“It was perfect,” Agatha insisted. “You were the perfect tour guide.”</p><p>Rio blushed and shrugged her shoulders. “Maybe that’s my calling if this whole hotel thing doesn’t work out.”</p><p>“So, when are we heading out for dinner?”</p><p>Rio checked the time. “We need to leave here in an hour.”</p><p>“Right, I need to get ready.” Agatha headed over to her bedroom door. “See you soon.”</p><p>“See you soon, m’lady,” Rio called out before heading to her own room to change.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile, her stomach filled with butterflies. Oh, she couldn’t wait for what was to come.</p><p> </p><p>Rio held Agatha’s hand as they walked the streets of Trastevere, taking in their surroundings as they went. It was her favourite neighbourhood of Rome, yet she particularly enjoyed it at night when the streets were lit up by string lights tangled in the canopies and cascading ivy.</p><p>Agatha was a vision in herself, dressed in a simple black dress with her hair set in its usual lose spirals. Rio had chosen a green pantsuit and had to bite back a smile every time she caught Agatha looking her over. She loved being under Agatha’s approving gaze, even if it was probably just platonic admiration.</p><p>Soon they arrived at her favourite spot: a small family-owned restaurant tucked away from the tourist traps. The owner saw to them personally, greeting Rio as he always did before introducing himself to Agatha and leading them to their table.</p><p>Rio ordered them a bottle of wine, and they each gave their choices of courses. When the wine arrived, Rio poured them each a glass and encouraged Agatha to try it.</p><p>Agatha took a sip and nodded approvingly. “That is some good wine.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I sampled it the first time I came here and ordered it. I’m in the process of getting in all our Italian hotels.”</p><p>“So, you come here often?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Alone?”</p><p>“I brought Matt once when he persuaded me to come watch the local soccer team. Only for a spot of lunch though.”</p><p>“And no one else?”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “So, have you enjoyed your day in Rome?”</p><p>“I have,” Agatha answered with a smile. “Thank you for bringing me.”</p><p>“I should thank you too. Sure, I have people here, but they’re not, well, they’re not…”</p><p>“Me?” Agatha helpfully supplied and Rio laughed shyly.</p><p>“No, not even close.”</p><p>Agatha swirled her wine in her glass. “Your assistant has a crush on you.”</p><p>Rio blinked in surprise. “What?”</p><p>“Honey. She has a crush on you.”</p><p>Rio laughed dismissively. “No, she doesn’t.”</p><p>“She does,” Agatha insisted. “The way she smiles at you and flutters her little eyelashes. She might as well have ‘I heart Rio Vidal’ written on her hand in sharpie.”</p><p>Rio frowned, thinking back to earlier that day. How Honey had been overly happy to see her, how she sat on her desk waiting for her, how she spoke about Agatha. Her frown deepened.</p><p>“But that makes no sense. Why would she like me?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “I have no idea. I mean, who would want a gorgeous millionaire who also happens to be smart, kind and occasionally funny?”</p><p>“Occasionally?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Is that all you go from that?”</p><p>Rio grinned and shook her head. “You think I’m gorgeous.”</p><p>“So what if I do?” Agatha challenged, putting Rio back in her place. “And back on topic, has anything ever happened between you and Honey?”</p><p>“She’s my employee,” Rio reminded her. “That would be totally unethical.”</p><p>“So you don’t like her?”</p><p>“As a colleague I do.”</p><p>“But not as anything more?”</p><p>“You know I don’t.”</p><p>Agatha smiled with clear satisfaction. “Good.”</p><p>“Good?”</p><p>Agatha nodded and took another sip of her wine. “So, let’s talk about this hotel of yours.”</p><p>They were there until closing. Eating, drinking, but mostly talking. About the hotel. About Rome. About life. It was easy. It was fun. It was nice.</p><p>It was the best dinner of Rio’s life.</p><p>By the end of the night, their bill was in the hundreds, and she paid it without a care. Her driver was waiting just down the river to take them back to their hotel, and so they walked arm in arm along the riverside, looking across to the far bank and to the Isola Tiberina nestled in between.</p><p>“Is there anything you wish to see if you come again?” Rio asked, and Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“I regret not seeing the Trevi Fountain now, but it’s not like it’s going anywhere. I wasn’t in the mood for the crowds earlier, and it wasn’t the same going on my own.”</p><p>Rio kicked herself. She should have gone with her, though she understood what Agatha meant. The tourist crowds were overwhelming, and the fountain would be awash with visitors even at that time.</p><p>“Don’t do that,” Agatha told her, snapping Rio out of her thoughts.</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>“Think you messed up. You can’t book out the Trevi Fountain, Rio.”</p><p>“I know, but…”</p><p>“But you gave me the best Rome experience with nothing but a vespa and a meal in a small restaurant. That was all you. Not your money or your influence. Just you being thoughtful. That means more to me than some old fountain, anyway.”</p><p>Rio smiled at that, though it certainly gave her another idea…</p><p>They found her driver and soon enough, they were back at the hotel and their night had come to a close. When they made it back to the suite, Agatha kicked off her heels and groaned.</p><p>“Remind me why I wore these?”</p><p>“I told you your Birkenstocks would have been fine.”</p><p>Agatha waved her off, before smiling at her sincerely. “Thank you for a wonderful night, Rio.”</p><p>“You’re most welcome,” Rio assured. “But we best get some rest. Our flight is very early.”</p><p>Agatha went to say something but quickly stopped herself. Instead, she nodded in understanding. “Goodnight Rio.”</p><p>Feeling bold, Rio took her hand and lifted it to her lips. “Goodnight,” she whispered, before placing a soft kiss to her knuckles.</p><p>She heard Agatha’s voice catch in her throat, but she didn’t pull away. Rio took that as a good sign.</p><p>She stepped back, allowing Agatha’s hand to slip softly from hers, before heading to her room. Rio smiled to herself secretly. She had one more surprise up her sleeve, and it was the best one yet.</p><p> </p><p>It seemed Agatha had barely rested her head on the pillow before an excited knock at her bedroom door broke through her slumber.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice called through. “Are you up? We need to get ready to go.”</p><p>Agatha checked her phone and groaned. “Rio, it’s not even three in the morning!”</p><p>“I know, but I need to make a stop on the way to the airport.”</p><p>Agatha grumbled but dragged herself out of bed anyway. Luckily, she had put most of her things away before bed and so all she had to do was quickly get ready and throw the rest of her things in the top of her bag. After double checking she had everything, she headed out into the living area.</p><p>Rio was on the couch waiting for her, only to shoot up as soon as she entered. “You ready?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, and followed Rio as she practically raced out of the room. “What possibly do you need to do at this time in the morning?”</p><p>“You’ll see!”</p><p>Her car was waiting out front and they both climbed into the back. Rio spoke to him in Italian, so quick Agatha couldn’t make out a word besides ‘grazie’.</p><p>They set off and Agatha didn’t think much for a few blocks, until she saw a signpost for the airport pointing in the opposite direction. “This isn’t even on the way to the airport, Rio.”</p><p>“I know, but this is important,” Rio insisted. “We won’t be long. I promise.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and looked out of the window, watching the streets pass by. Her plan had failed the night before, but what irritated her most (besides the lack of sleep) was that she was almost pleased it failed. She was happy just <em>being</em> with Rio, and that…it scared her a little. Not because she didn’t understand why, but because she knew full well what it meant.</p><p>After a while, she couldn’t help but feel their route was familiar. Like she had travelled it before. Though she figured it must been in her head. That the buildings were just all too similar. Yet when Rio’s driver pulled up and they both jumped out of the car, she had the strangest sense of…familiarity? Déjà vu? She wasn’t sure.</p><p>“Rio, why are we here?”</p><p>“Just follow me,” Rio encouraged as they headed down a side street. “It’ll be worth it.”</p><p>Agatha followed her down the street. The shops were shut and the restaurants closed, but she recognised the signs, the names. When she spotted a columned building at the very end, she knew she had been there before.</p><p>“Rio, where are we?”</p><p>Rio just smiled. “I promise the only money I spent was on the extra fuel getting us here. The rest is just the magic of the city.”</p><p>They reached the end of the street and Agatha froze.</p><p>There was it was. The Trevi Fountain, illuminated in the night. Without a single other person there.</p><p>“I googled when the best time was to go,” Rio admitted. “I think we’re the only ones crazy enough to show up at this time.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. Instead, she walked forward, down the steps towards the glowing turquoise water. She stopped at the marble edge and stared up at the scene depicted in stone. To Oceanus, to the sea horses and the tritons, and then to the water running below.</p><p>It was…it was a masterpiece.</p><p>“What do you think?” Rio asked. “Worth getting up in the middle of the night for?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, trying hard not to cry. “Thank you, Rio.”</p><p>“It’s not over yet.” Rio fished in her pocket and opened her palm to reveal two euros. “We need to make our wishes.”</p><p>Agatha took one of the coins and held it tight between her thumb and forefinger, while Rio did the same.</p><p>“Okay, make your wish and throw it on three.”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>“One.”</p><p>“Two.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, channelling her wish to the copper pressed between her fingertips.</p><p>
<em>Please make me brave.</em>
</p><p>“Three.”</p><p>They tossed the coins into the water, watching as they sank to the bottom.</p><p>“There were go.” Rio looked to her with her usual grin. “Now we just have to wait for our wishes to come true.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t know what made her do it. Perhaps it was sleep-deprivation, or the shock of the surprise, or the way Rio looked so beautiful in the glow of the fountain. But she did it.</p><p>She leaned forward and placed a kiss to Rio’s cheek. Her lips lingered against her skin before slowly pulling away enough to take in Rio’s shocked expression.</p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered, taking Rio’s hand in hers. “You’ve seriously outdone yourself.”</p><p>Rio smiled and squeezed her hand. “Not a bad date, am I?”</p><p>Agatha laughed and shook her head. “Not bad at all.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>To say Agatha was sad to be back on that island paradise was an understatement.</p><p>Not because she hated it. Not at all. In fact, she would be sad when she had to return to the hustle and bustle of New York (yes, Rome had been busy, but it didn’t smell like corndogs and pollution). Yet, as their taxi drove up towards Lilia’s villa, it occurred to Agatha that her alone time with Rio was over. Perhaps one of the best twenty-four hours of her life done and dusted. And now, she had to deal with the after.</p><p>Particularly the knot in her stomach that formed whenever she looked at the woman sat next to her.</p><p>Rio seemed her usual self: smiling as she took in the surrounding scenery. In that moment, Agatha envied her. She had already gone through this, the acceptance of feelings, in 0.01 seconds the moment they first met. She hadn’t had to deal with the reluctance, the doubt, the fear.</p><p>Perhaps she should just kiss Rio and see what happened, though she suspected it would send Rio into some kind of millionaire overdrive and she wasn’t sure she wanted to open that pandora’s box just to work out her feelings.</p><p>But how was she supposed to feel? Emotions weren’t easy for her. From her upbringing to her self-isolated adulthood, she’d never really understand how she felt. Besides anger. That she knew pretty well, and so everything eventually manifested in some variation. Hatred, annoyance, frustration.</p><p>She had tried to hate Rio, tried to find her annoying and frustrating. None of that worked.</p><p>And so, she was stuck.</p><p>“I can’t wait to get in that pool,” Rio mused as they pulled up outside of the villa. “I’m dying to get into my bikini.”</p><p>Agatha bit back a groan. Rio in a bikini wasn’t what she needed right now.</p><p>“Well, I plan on going for a nap,” she stated plainly. “As much as I loved the reason why, I’m not built for getting up so early.”</p><p>“But you’ll mess up your sleep schedule.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “It’s a two-hour nap. What difference will it make?”</p><p>It ended up being four, and by the time she dragged herself downstairs, everyone was already out by the pool. Or in it, in Rio’s case.</p><p>Jen laughed when she saw her. “Ah, look who’s finally risen.”</p><p>“I was up at two this morning,” Agatha argued before flopping on the sunbed beside her. “So, what did you guys get up to while we were away?”</p><p>“We were down at the beach all day yesterday,” Lilia explained from her own sunbed. “Then we picked up some pizzas for dinner.”</p><p>“Yeah, walked up that hill with those boxes wasn’t fun.” Alice looked over her shoulder from where she sat on the edge of the pool, her legs dangling in the water. “Rio said you two had a good time in Rome.”</p><p>“We did,” Agatha confirmed. “Rio is a very good host.”</p><p>Rio swam to the edge of the pool and smiled across at them all. “Maybe next time we could all go. Have a shopping trip.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. She didn’t like the sound of that. Two was company, but five was a crowd. A very annoying crowd.</p><p>“Darling, if we wanted to shop, we’d go to Milan,” Lilia said between sips of her cocktail (it was barely midday). “Though I would love to see this villa on Lake Como Alice told us about last night.”</p><p>Agatha noticed Rio give Alice a disapproving look, who held her hands up in defence.</p><p>“I know, I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Agatha, tell her she needs to take us,” Jen encouraged. “It sounds magical.”</p><p>“Rio can do whatever she wants,” she answered, noting the way it made Rio smile.</p><p>Jen huffed and picked up her phone. “You two are so boring.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “We’ve literally been on a whirlwind trip to Rome. How is that boring?”</p><p>“Because if it were me and Alice, we’d still be in our hotel room hungover after staying up all night clubbing and fucking. I mean, did you guys even kiss?”</p><p>“No, we did not,” Agatha snapped, noticing how Rio retreated to swim at the far side of the pool.</p><p>“See? Boring.”</p><p>Agatha shot Jen a glare before picking up her book. She tried to read, tried to distract herself from the whirlwind in her mind and heart, yet she couldn’t help but peak over the pages to where Rio swam lengths of the pool. The sight of her muscular arms and toned stomach rippling as she moved through the water was downright sinful.</p><p>She pressed her thighs together and bit her lip. She needed to do something about Rio soon or she was going to implode.</p><p> </p><p>They needed some supplies, so Rio offered to join Alice to retrieve them from the closest store.</p><p>“I don’t know what to do,” she admitted as they walked down to the village. “We had the most perfect time in Rome, and I felt closer to her than ever. Maybe now is the time…”</p><p>“Do <em>not</em> propose to her,” Alice interrupted. “You haven’t even kissed.”</p><p>“I can’t propose to her. I told you. We have a deal.”</p><p>“That’s the only thing stopping you, isn’t it?”</p><p>Rio kept quiet. Admittedly, she had taken the ring with her to Rome and had regretted the fact she couldn’t have just dropped tone one knee in front of the Trevi Fountain earlier that morning. Yet the moment had been perfect enough, and knew Agatha would appreciate her sticking to her word. Now the ring was now safely hidden in her room, somewhere Alice, and more importantly Agatha, would never find it.</p><p>“I thought you were going to ask her on a date?” Alice asked.</p><p>“What do you think Rome was?”</p><p>“Did she know it was a date?”</p><p>“No, but…”</p><p>“Then it doesn’t count.”</p><p>Rio groaned. This romance thing was so confusing.</p><p>“Ask her out. You could take her to the hotel. I’m sure you could arrange a private balcony or something. You do own the place.”</p><p>“Part-own,” Rio corrected. “And that might work on Jen but Agatha…she likes when I don’t use my money or my connections. Like in Rome, I showed her round on a vespa and took her to dinner at a small family-run restaurant. Somewhere genuine, not somewhere that has a Michelin star plastered by the door. I loved it and she loved it too.”</p><p>“Then why don’t you make her dinner?” Alice suggested. “Not tonight, because Lilia is making lasagne, but tomorrow? We could have dinner at the hotel and leave you guys to it.”</p><p>Rio looked to her best friend in surprise. “You’d do that?”</p><p>Alice nodded. “And Lilia and Jen would because they loved that dinner the other night…and they think Agatha needs to get laid.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks went bright red. “I don’t know about that just yet…”</p><p>Alice rolled her eyes. “Please. I know you aren’t a very sexual person, but you look at Agatha like a horny teenager.”</p><p>“No, I don’t!” Rio looked down to her feet. “Okay, maybe I do.”</p><p>“It’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Alice assured. “Sometimes I look at Jen and want to rip her clothes off there and then, whether it’s in the bedroom or in the check-out line in Target.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Since when has Jen ever gone to target?”</p><p>“We went to get her a new TV. She hated every minute.”</p><p>Rio laughed even harder. “I so wish I’d been there.”</p><p>Alice chuckled. “It was very funny.”</p><p>They’d reached the bay and headed along towards the village. Rio looked out at the sea and wondered if Agatha was looking at it too.</p><p>“Alright,” she decided. “Let’s do it.”</p><p>Alice grinned and patted her on the back. “Atta boy.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha watched the boats bob on the horizon, the sea glistening like it was made of diamonds. She wondered absently if Rio had a yacht. Of course she did. What millionaire didn’t have a fucking yacht? It was probably a ridiculous one, with jet skis and a waterslide. With a whole crew and enough bedrooms to count as a boutique hotel. She tried to remind herself of the likely absurdities, but her mind instead conjured the image of Rio looking out to the large expanse of shimmering water, the light breeze catching her hair as she looked over her shoulder with a glimmering smile.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. That ridiculous woman was truly stuck in her head.</p><p>“Daydreaming about your little getaway?” Jen teased as she moved to stand beside her, a cosmo in her hand. “Lilia’s making cocktails again.”</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha said with a chuckle. Vacation Lilia was fuelled by alcohol.</p><p>“So how was Rome really?”</p><p>“It was great,” Agatha said honestly. “Not perfect. Her hotel is a work in progress, and she has a very…hands on assistant.”</p><p>Jen smiled. “Oh, is that a hint of jealousy I hear?”</p><p>“Not at all,” Agatha insisted while the thought of <em>Honey</em> made her blood curdle. “I am gravely aware Rio doesn’t have eyes for anyone but me.”</p><p>“For now,” Jen commented. “I mean, the longer you put her off, she might find someone else.”</p><p>“She won’t,” Agatha quickly dismissed. “She has made it very clear that I’m ‘the one’.”</p><p>Jen took a sip of her drink. “Lots of people end up with people who aren’t ‘the one’.”</p><p>“Not Rio,” Agatha insisted. “She would never settle for second best.”</p><p>Jen laughed. “Your confidence never fails to amaze me. But seriously, what is this Honey like?</p><p>“Young, pretty, annoying.”</p><p>“I want to see a picture. What’s her name?”</p><p>“Honey,” Agatha said bitterly, and frowned as Jen pulled out her phone. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“A bit of LinkedIn stalking.” She seemed to be scrolling until she gasped. “No fucking way. Is that her?”</p><p>Jen turned her phone to reveal a picture of Honey in a cute dress, likely at some kind of event. A work event Rio may have been at too. Agatha looked at the screen and glared. “Yep, that’s her.”</p><p>“Oh, you have some serious competition,” Jen teased, and Agatha’s glare quickly turned on her.</p><p>“The only competition she’d beat me at is who has the most pathetic crush on their fucking boss,” Agatha snapped. “And anyway, I told Rio, and she said she isn’t interested, so there.”</p><p>“Well, you might be right.” Jen set her phone aside before taking a sip of her drink. “Rio may only have eyes for you, and sure she’s bought you that ring, but I’m just saying women have needs.”</p><p>Agatha’s whole body tensed. Had she…had she just said… “A ring?”</p><p>Jen’s eyes widened in horror, slapping a hand over her mouth. “Oh fuck.”</p><p>“Jen?”</p><p>“Oh fuck.”</p><p>“Jen…”</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck. Alice is going to be so mad at me.”</p><p>“Jen!” Agatha snapped. “Tell me exactly what you know. Right. Now.”</p><p>“I can’t,” Jen answered. “I promised Alice I wouldn’t say anything because she promised Rio she wouldn’t say anything.”</p><p>“No, no. It’s too late for that now. Tell me what you know or so help me…”</p><p>Jen sighed. “Fine, but only because it’s not what you think.”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms, waiting to hear this explanation.</p><p>“So…Rio got you an engagement ring.”</p><p>Agatha went to argue, but Jen quickly stopped her.</p><p>“But she’s not proposing until you ask her to. She wasn’t going to get the ring, but she saw it in a jeweller’s window in Rome and knew it was the ring for you. No fancy custom made millions of dollars’ worth in diamonds ring, just something that made her think of you.”</p><p>Agatha relaxed a little. In fact, a part of her found it quite charming. “Have you seen it?”</p><p>Jen shook her head. “I wanted to look for it in Rio’s room, but Alice figured she’d have taken it with you guys to Rome or hidden it somewhere we’d never find it. Apparently, Rio can be quite devious, but her honesty often lets her down.”</p><p>Agatha was inclined to agree. She knew if she confronted Rio about this, she’d tell the absolute truth without hesitation.</p><p>Jen took hold of her shoulders. “You can’t say a word, Agatha. To Alice or Rio. You didn’t hear this from me, do you understand?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Calm down, Kale. I won’t say shit.”</p><p>Jen blinked in surprise. “You won’t?”</p><p>“Why would I?”</p><p>“Because you’ve been looking for any reason to put Rio down for something since you met her? What’s changed?”</p><p>
<em>I caught feelings for her.</em>
</p><p>“I like her company.”</p><p>Jen narrowed her eyes. “Right…”</p><p>Before Jen could say more, Alice’s voice called out from the house. “Babe, we’re back!”</p><p>They both looked round to see Alice and Rio walking out onto the deck. Agatha’s heart jumped at the sight of the latter but manged to keep her cool.</p><p>“Oh, a cosmo.” Alice took a sip of Jen’s drink before quickly kissing her. “Lilia is making Rio a piña colada if anyone else wants one.”</p><p>Agatha eyed Rio suspiciously. “Are you going to get drunk again?”</p><p>Rio waved her off. “I don’t get drunk…unless it’s free. Anyway, I figured one at midday wouldn’t hurt my head that much.”</p><p>“Alright then,” Agatha sighed. “I guess I’ll have one too.”</p><p>“Great,” Rio grinned. “Let’s go tell Lilia.”</p><p>Agatha followed Rio towards the house, glancing over her shoulder as she went. Jen raised her eyebrows at her, and she replied with a wink.</p><p>Perhaps it was time to set her old plan back into action. Sleep with Rio, work out whatever these stupid feelings were, and keep Rio immune to <em>Honey’s</em> charms.</p><p>Oh, and maybe catch a glimpse of this supposed ring while she was at it.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been acting weird all day. If Rio had to choose an adjective, she would say ‘clingy’, though that didn’t totally describe it.</p><p>When Rio was in the pool, Agatha would either get in too or sit on the edge watching her, then when she got out, Agatha would either take up the sunbed next to her or sit at the end of hers, chattering away about this and that.</p><p>She’d asked Rio to apply her suncream twice and had offered to return the favour, but Rio always declined and got Alice to sneakily do it instead. Rubbing the cream into Agatha’s skin was torturous enough, but having Agatha’s hands all over her would make her combust.</p><p>Her relief had come when everyone went upstairs to shower and get ready for dinner. Rio managed to use their shower (Agatha said she’d have a bath after dinner) and got ready pretty quick, making it down in time to help Lilia get the salad ready.</p><p>“You are a gem,” Lilia praised. “It’s nice to have a helping hand in the kitchen, especially one that seems to know what they’re doing.”</p><p>“I’ve helped out in a few kitchens,” Rio admitted. “The chefs at my dad’s hotel restaurants taught me loads of tricks, and I do like to cook for myself when I’m staying somewhere for a while.”</p><p>“A gorgeous millionaire who’s smart, kind, and can cook? How have you not been snapped up by now?”</p><p>Rio bowed her head to hide her blush. “Been waiting for the right lady.”</p><p>Lilia hummed in agreement. “Well, I’ll be glad when my goddaughter finally gets her head out of her ass is all I will say.”</p><p>Alice and Jen walked in hand in hand, and Lilia quickly got them to work setting the table.</p><p>“Where’s Agatha?” Jen questioned. “Is she still upstairs?”</p><p>“Guess so,” Rio answered. “She hasn’t been down.”</p><p>Jen looked at the stairs cautiously before snapping her attention to Rio. “Have you asked her to have that stay-in dinner with you tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio gave Alice a disapproving look, who held up her hands once again. “We literally booked the table already. I had to tell them!”</p><p>Rio looked to Lilia and found the older woman nodding along. Great. Alice big mouth strikes again.</p><p>“I haven’t asked her yet, but I will…maybe.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “Rio, please do something already. It’s frustrating to watch.”</p><p>“I don’t want to push.”</p><p>“You’ve literally told her you want to marry her,” Alice recalled.</p><p>“And look how well that turned out.”</p><p>“Well, ask her or I will,” Lilia warned. “By hell or highwater, you are having a meal for two in this very room tomorrow night.”</p><p>Rio focused on tossing the salad, hoping Lilia would forget that declaration as soon as she had another glass of wine.</p><p>Agatha arrived down the stairs not long after, her hair tied back and wearing a simple sundress. Rio quickly noted how the sun had covered her shoulder in cute freckles, and she wished to map every single one. She continued to study them once they sat opposite each other at the table digging into Lilia’s ridiculously good lasagne.</p><p>“So does this beat the food in Rome?” Jen asked and Rio shrugged.</p><p>“All good food in my opinion.”</p><p>“Though I preferred the company in Rome,” Agatha admitted before stealing Jen a glance.</p><p>“Oh, come on,” Alice pipped up. “You like us really, Agatha.”</p><p>“I suppose.” Agatha looked across at Rio and winked. “Though some more than others.”</p><p>Rio took a gulp of her wine and was relieved when her phone buzzed. Glad for the distraction, she checked the notification, only to instantly regret it.</p><p>
<strong>HONEY</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Hi Rio…we’re all wondering when you’ll be back. Morale is high when you’re here and your absence is very much felt! I was wondering if we could have dinner when you do make it back? I want to talk about my future at the company. You know, about my progression going forward.</em>
</p><p>Rio frowned. Honey wanted to go to dinner. Honey, her assistant…who Agatha insisted had a crush on her. This wasn’t good.</p><p>She glanced up and saw Agatha watched her closely. Rio offered her a quick smile before typing her reply.</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>we can talk when i get back. not sure when though. get your resume ready and i’ll send it to department heads for consideration. maybe i can organise a group meeting over zoom?</em>
</p><p>She put her phone face down on the table and cleared her throat, earning a concerned look from Alice and a suspicious one from Agatha. Rio would tell her about this later, but now wasn’t the time. Instead, she focused on enjoying her lasagne.</p><p>“Agatha, Jen, Alice and I are going to the hotel for dinner tomorrow,” Lilia announced. “Rio isn’t coming, so I said you’d stay here with her.”</p><p>Rio cringed. Fuck, why had Lilia been so blunt? Surely Agatha would protest being spoken to like…</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>Rio blinked at her in surprise, and it seemed her friend was equally startled.</p><p>“Wait, you’re actually cool with that?”</p><p>“Why wouldn’t I be?”</p><p>Jen eyed her suspiciously before continuing with her meal. Agatha met Rio’s gaze and smiled, a smile she quickly returned, and was about to tell her how nice tomorrow night would be, how she already couldn’t wait, when her phone buzzed again.</p><p>
<strong>HONEY</strong>
</p><p>
<em>I’d much prefer to talk about this with you. You know me.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>we’ll discuss this in person next time i see you. i’m in the middle of dinner</em>
</p><p>
<strong>HONEY</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Okay well hurry back…I miss you. </em>
</p><p>Rio didn’t reply and avoided Agatha’s sharp gaze for the rest of the dinner.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had been looking forward to her bath all day. Sure, the pool was fun and lounging in the sun was relaxing, but there was nothing better than a long soak after a whirlwind of travelling, and it also helped ease her luckily fading sunburn. So relaxing, in fact that she felt herself beginning to drift off…until someone knocked on one of the bathroom doors.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice called through. “Are you nearly done?”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha called back.</p><p>“I left my face moisturizer in there and I want to brush my teeth so I can get to sleep.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “The doors unlocked but I’ll warn you, I’m in the bath.”</p><p>“I won’t look,” Rio promised and true to her word, she kept her eyes averted as she entered the bathroom.</p><p>Agatha, however, did not.</p><p>Rio was dressed in a golden yellow silk slip that rested just below the curve of her ass, the lace helm brushing the top of her thighs. In the mirror, Agatha could see the exposed expanse of chest, and wished she could run her lips along her collarbone.</p><p>Agatha ogled the attire while Rio brushed her teeth, before lifting her gaze to appreciate her nighttime skin care routine.</p><p>“All those products,” she teased. “No wonder you look so baby faced.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “It’s to rehydrate my skin after all that sun.”</p><p>“Whatever you say.”</p><p>Rio paused her moisturising. “Hey, I need to talk to you about something.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart dropped before picking up in anticipation. Was Rio about to propose while she was in the bath? Surely not, surely it had to be something else. But what else could it be?</p><p>“What’s up?” Agatha managed to reply, her voice steady and composed.</p><p>Rio leaned on the sink, and Agatha could see the struggle in her reflection. “You know what you said yesterday about Honey? Well, she’s asked me if we can go to dinner to talk about her future.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows. “Oh did she now?”</p><p>“I’ve put her off. You know, remained professional, but then she told me she missed me.”</p><p>The fucking gall of that girl. “And what did you say to that?”</p><p>“Nothing. I ignored the messages and I’ve forwarded screenshots on to HR. They’ve advised I minimise my contact with her outside of work.”</p><p>“Or just fire her,” Agatha suggested. “Save the hassle.”</p><p>“I can’t just fire her. She’s good at her job, and HR said this could be read as just being friendly…”</p><p>“Friendly my ass,” Agatha huffed. “Next time she texts you, show me before you reply. I’ll help you reply.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio rubbed some cream over her cheeks before smiling at her reflection. “There, all done! I’ll see you in the morning.”</p><p>“See you in the morning,” Agatha repeated and watched Rio leave the room and shut the door behind her.</p><p>After another few minutes, Agatha got out of the bath and wrapped a towel around herself. She stared at her own reflection in the mirror. At her red cheeks and tired eyes. She knew she’d look better in the morning once she’d gotten a decent night’s sleep, and that she was never going to look amazing with sunburn everywhere. Yet she couldn’t help but think about Honey.</p><p>Young Honey.</p><p>Pretty Honey</p><p>Perfect Honey.</p><p>Honey who wanted Rio maybe almost as much as…as much as she did.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip in contemplation, before <em>finally</em> giving in.</p><p>She knocked on Rio’s door. “Rio, you still awake?”</p><p>“Yeah, what’s up?” The voice got closer the more she spoke, and Agatha was sure she was stood on the other side of the door.</p><p>“Open up,” she prompted, and the door opened to reveal Rio, still in the shift but with her hair slightly ruffled from her pillow.</p><p>“Agatha, are you oka…”</p><p>Before she could finish, Agatha leaned forward and pressed their lips together.</p><p>It was quick, the slightest of lingering but not much, before she pulled back to marvel Rio’s wide-eyed expression.</p><p>“Goodnight, Rio.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, totally flustered. “G-goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p>And with that, Agatha shut the door between them, pressing her lips together to prolong that brief sensation. A sensation she planned to experience again, and again.</p><p>Tomorrow, they would have the villa to themselves, and she was <em>certainly</em> going to make the most of it.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio woke up mid-morning. Something she hadn’t done since she was at college, and even then, that had been far and few between. She was a busy woman, and didn’t have the novelty of wasting daylight hours. There was always something to get up for, even if it was to just sip her morning coffee and contemplate life. Yet that morning she made an exception.</p><p>She was on vacation, and Agatha Harkness had kissed her.</p><p>To say it had been a surprise had been an understatement. A surprise that had her quietly jumping around her room in pure happiness. <em>Agatha had kissed her!!! </em></p><p>The first kiss with the love of her life.</p><p>Her mind played it over and over in her mind.</p><p>Agatha calling for her.</p><p>Her opening the door and Agatha being right there.</p><p>Agatha leaning in.</p><p>Their lips meeting.</p><p>Agatha’s soft lips.</p><p>It had been quick, and Agatha had said goodnight straight after, but to Rio it was perfect. She wouldn’t trade that moment for anything in the world.</p><p>Then, like an infection, doubt crept across her mind.</p><p>She’d told Agatha about Honey right before the kiss. Had it been an act of jealousy? A spontaneous reaction that she may very well have regretted instantly, or more likely the morning after. Or was it a way to stake her claim? To remind Rio she was hers and could never be anyone else’s. Like she ever could be…</p><p>After a while she tried to listen to music to calm herself down, which worked until <em>Casual </em>came on her queue and she ended up spiralling again.</p><p>Eventually, it was the exhaustion that made her sleep.</p><p>When she eventual woke, sunlight burning through the windows, she quickly got herself ready and headed downstairs. Everyone was around the pool. Lilia was sat in the shade, Jen and Alice were sharing a sunbed, and Agatha was on the far bed reading yet another book.</p><p>Their eyes met almost instantly, and Rio’s heart lurched so hard she almost lost her balance.</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a moment before returning her attention to the book.</p><p>“Hey.” Alice sat up. “You’re up late.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio perched on the edge of the sun bed beside her friend and her girlfriend, one away from Agatha. “Stayed up late last night.”</p><p>“Still you’re usually up at the crack of dawn.”</p><p>“I know.” Rio squinted up at the sky. “It’s weird waking up when it’s this bright.”</p><p>She hard Agatha hum behind her, but Alice’s face remained concerned.</p><p>“Has something happened?”</p><p>“No,” Rio answered quickly. “I was just wired.”</p><p>Alice eyed her suspiciously but didn’t press further.</p><p>“Well, I for one am looking forward to dinner tonight,” Lilia announced. “Though I am sad you and Agatha aren’t joining us.”</p><p>Rio was about to answer when Agatha cut in. “Rio and I want a quiet night in, and I hate walking up and down that hill.”</p><p>“I’d carry you,” Rio said without thinking, causing all eyes to land on her in both amusement and surprise. She decided that was a good time to jump in the pool.</p><p>Alice soon joined her and encouraged her to swim to the far of the pool. They leaned arms folded on the edge with their backs to their friends.</p><p>Alice nudged her playfully. “Okay, what happened?”</p><p>Rio glanced over her shoulder. “I can’t say.”</p><p>“Because of you-know-who sat over there.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer, but Alice seemed to understand.</p><p>“Shall we go for a walk? Talk about it properly?”</p><p>Before she could reply, Jen’s voice carried across the water.</p><p>“Agatha, come make a mojito with me.”</p><p>“Jen, I’m reading.”</p><p>“Come onnn.”</p><p>Rio heard Agatha huff. “Fine, but I don’t know why you’re incapable of making your own cocktail, Kale.”</p><p>They both looked to see Agatha and Jen heading into the villa. Alice then looked to her expectantly. “Okay, spill.”</p><p>“There’s not much to spill,” Rio lied.</p><p>“Fuck off. I know you too well, Rio Vidal. I know you’re lying. This is about Agatha, isn’t it?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“So yes.”</p><p>Rio hid her head in her hands. “Please, just leave it Alice.”</p><p>“I can’t. You look exhausted and I know it’s not from your early flight yesterday. You’re like the bionic women when it comes to jet-lag.”</p><p>“You can’t get jet-lag from Rome to Sicily,” Rio pointed out.</p><p>“Come on,” Alice pleaded. “Tell me!”</p><p>Rio sighed. “Fine but keep your voice down.”</p><p>Alice mimed zipping her mouth shut and waited for Rio to begin.</p><p>“Well, Honey was texting me last night asking if I could take her to dinner...”</p><p>“Oh wow.”</p><p>“I dealt with it professionally…”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“And, well, Agatha was in the bath, but she left the door unlocked and she said I could come in to do my skincare…”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“I told her about Honey, because I don’t want to hide things from her, and she told me to fire her, then said to show her the texts first next time…”</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>“So I finished up and went back to my room, and I was just getting settled when she called for me. I opened the bathroom door and…”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And she kissed me.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened. “<em>She</em> kissed <em>you?</em>”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“What kind of kiss?”</p><p>
<em>“Alice…”</em>
</p><p>“This is important information, Rio.”</p><p>“It was only a few seconds, more than a peck but nothing too deep.”</p><p>“Wow.” Alice stared at her in awe. “Then what happened?”</p><p>“We said goodnight and shut the door.”</p><p>“That’s it?”</p><p>“That’s it.”</p><p>Alice seemed to consider her words before landing another question. “So what are you going to do now?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I guess I just keep doing what I have been doing. Waiting and…”</p><p>“No, no, no. You need to do the opposite now.”</p><p>“What?” Rio frowned. “But I thought…”</p><p>“That was before Agatha made the first move.” Alice patted her on the back. “It’s time for you to get the girl!”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “Propose?”</p><p>“No, you idiot. Make your move.”</p><p>“My move?”</p><p>Alice sighed. “Okay, I’m going to say this as simply as I can so you will understand.”</p><p>“Okay?”</p><p>Alice shifted and put her hands on her shoulders. “You need to kiss her next.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “I do?”</p><p>“You do. She made the first move. Now it’s your time to shine. Tonight, you need to sweep her off her feet, then land one on her so hot she’ll be hooked.”</p><p>Rio grimaced. “Can I just kiss her nicely?”</p><p>“You can kiss her nicely on your wedding day. This time you need to kiss her like you fucking mean it. You understand?”</p><p>Rio nodded. Kiss her like she meant it. She could do that. Just kiss Agatha again. Hopefully longer and much more deeply than the last.</p><p>She could do that. Totally.</p><p>“Thanks, Alice.”</p><p>“No problem, but you know I need to be best man at your wedding, right?”</p><p>Rio chuckled and pulled her into a hug. “I wouldn’t think of choosing anyone else.”</p><p>They embraced for a while, until they were pulled apart by a sharp cough. Their gazes followed the sound and spotted Jen stood at the far end of the pool with her hands on her hips. Agatha stood behind her holding the two cocktails with an equally pissed expression.</p><p>“What are you to doing?” Jen demanded.</p><p>“Hugging,” Rio answered. “We were having a deep discussion.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Alice agreed. “Can’t I hug my best friend, Jen?”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes and took her cocktail from Agatha. “I’m letting you off considering we all know Rio isn’t interested in you. But I’m watching you, Wu-Gulliver.”</p><p>Alice held up her hands in surrender. “I’m all yours, babe.”</p><p>Jen laughed as she settled back on her sunbed. “And don’t you forget it.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, who stared back at her with the same irritated expression. She was about to say something when Alice’s hands pushed her under the water.</p><p>When she reached the surface again, gasping for breath, she quickly whirled round and dunked Alice in return. “Asshole!”</p><p>“Careful, children,” Lilia called over. “I want no tears in my pool.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scowled at her book.</p><p>It was all her own fault. She’d gone and kissed Rio and made things ten times worse.</p><p>The only reason she had managed to sleep was because she was so fucking exhausted from being up at 2am the day before, and even so it had taken her almost two hours to settle. Her mind raced with the memory of the kiss, and fantasies of more to come.</p><p>Preferably in bed.</p><p>Preferably naked.</p><p>Unfortunately, she’d talked Rio into this ridiculous nonchalance (or as nonchalant as Rio could be), and now she was stuck making initiation. She wanted the old Rio. The Rio who bid millions to have dinner at a restaurant she didn’t like just to spend time with her and sent her Cartier to ask her for coffee (even though it really pissed her off at the time). She had seen a touch of that in Rome, with her thoughtfulness and her determination to make a life-long dream come true. Now she wanted that Rio to sweep her off her feet, to kiss her with all that passion then whisk her off to one of their bedrooms. To spend the rest of their vacation intertwined, until they had to head back to reality.</p><p>Though she did want to see Rio’s apartment when they got back to New York, and this Victoria she spoke so highly of, and maybe invite Rio round to her place, and maybe even…</p><p>Agatha slammed her book shut.</p><p>She was so fucked.</p><p>“What did that book ever do to you?” Lilia asked as she perched on the end of her sunbed. Agatha sighed and set the book down beside her.</p><p>“I have a lot on my mind.”</p><p>Lilia smirked. “Oh, I know.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows. “You know?”</p><p>Lilia nodded over to where Alice and Rio were playing over-head catch at the far end of the pool, Jen sitting on the edge as referee. “Those two are terrible whisperers.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. She knew Rio had told Alice. “It was just a kiss.”</p><p>Her godmother laughed. “Please. Everyone with eyes can see you like her now.”</p><p>“I don’t!” Agatha insisted. “She just…she confuses me.”</p><p>“No, she doesn’t,” Lilia stated as fact. “You have that gleam in your eye. It might have happened before Rome, but it was definitely there after. You have feelings for her and you know it. You acted on them last night.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t go that far,” Agatha lied, but her godmother ignored her.</p><p>“Just talk to her. Admitting your feelings doesn’t mean you have to start wedding dress shopping, though I’d appreciate enough notice to buy a nice hat.”</p><p>“But…” Agatha tried to find a counter argument, but she came up stumps. “Fine, but if it goes wrong, I’m blaming you.”</p><p>Lilia grinned. “I totally accept responsibility. It gives me good material for my godmother of the bride speech.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m not marrying her.”</p><p>“We’ll see about that.” Lilia chuckled as she got to her feet. “Rio!”</p><p>Rio froze, her arms up in the air with the ball held up over her head. Agatha but back a smile at her startled expression.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Agatha wants to speak to you.”</p><p>As Lilia walked away, Agatha watched the object of her desire swim across the water, noting the way her muscles flexed with each stroke.</p><p>Rio pulled herself out of the pool and moved to sit where Lilia had on the end of the sun bed. She was dripping on Agatha’s legs but she didn’t mind.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>“Hey.” Rio smiled at her. “What’s up? You okay?”</p><p>“I’m good,” Agatha assured. “Better than good.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “I’m looking forward to dinner tonight.”</p><p>“You are?” Rio seemed surprised, which just made Agatha bolder.</p><p>“I am.” She sat up and leaned forward, her voice dropping so only Rio could hear. “And I’m hoping we can pick up where we left off last night.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened comically. Agatha cocked a questioning eyebrow.</p><p>“Well?”</p><p>Rio gulped and nodded.</p><p>“Good.” Agatha lay back down. “Now, go back to your game. Just don’t tire yourself out too much. We have plans, Ms Vidal.”</p><p>Rio smiled as she stood up. “Yes, ma’am. I’m looking forward to seeing you properly later.”</p><p>Agatha smirked as she watched Rio jump back into the pool. Oh she hoped to see a <em>lot</em> more of Rio later.</p><p> </p><p>Rio jumped around the kitchen, making sure her spaghetti was boiling and her sauce wasn’t burning. Everything had to be perfect. Well, as perfect as it could be using whatever Lilia had around to throw a dinner together. Her plan had been to buy some actual ingredients that afternoon, but soon the actual dinner part of their evening had suddenly become low on her priorities, and so she made a quick meal and hoped it would grant them some <em>alone time</em> after.</p><p>The thought alone made her heart do somersaults.</p><p>Alice walked down the stairs, dressed in what would have been a smart suit if she hadn’t swapped the blazer for her leather jacket. “Food smells good.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio stirred the sauce once more. “You guys ready to go?”</p><p>“They’re just finishing up.” Alice leaned against the counter. “You nervous?”</p><p>“A little,” she admitted. “I don’t want to mess it up.”</p><p>“You won’t” Alice assured. “Just kiss her dizzy then take advantage of the empty house and go…”</p><p>“No, no, no,” Rio quickly stopped her. “None of that. At least not tonight anyway.”</p><p>Alice gave her a sceptical look. “There’s no way you two are going to stop at just kissing. Once you start, it’ll take a natural disaster to tear you two apart.”</p><p>Rio checked the spaghetti before returning her attention back to the sauce. “I don’t want to rush in too quick and fuck everything up.”</p><p>“You literally said you wanted to marry her the third time you saw her in person.”</p><p>“That’s different. Sex is…uncharted territory.</p><p>“Rio, you have had sex,” Alice reminded her. “Maybe not a lot, but you have done it before.”</p><p>“I know, but this will be different. This is Agatha.”</p><p>“But it’s not like you’re a fumbling teenager that doesn’t know what their doing,” Alice argued. “You know the basic routine.”</p><p>“I haven’t done it for a while. You know that.”</p><p>“I do, but it’ll be fine. Just don’t overthink everything for once.”</p><p>Rio nodded in acceptance. “Thanks Alice.”</p><p>“Anytime.” Alice pulled her into a hug. “Who knew we’d be dating best friends.”</p><p>“One, they’re not best friends, and two, Agatha and I aren’t dating.”</p><p>“Yet.” Alice pulled away and smirked at her. “I can’t wait to see you finally dating. It’s going to be so fun.”</p><p>“I agree,” Jen said as she walked over to greet them, dressed in yet another gorgeous pearl pink sundress. “I’ll be relieved when this ridiculous saga is finally over and we can move on to the juicier stuff.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Juicier stuff?”</p><p>“Yeah, you’re like my own personal reality show.”</p><p>“Jen,” Alice warned. “Leave them alone.”</p><p>“What? It’s a compliment. It means their relationship isn’t fucking boring.”</p><p>“There is no relationship yet,” Rio quickly corrected, and Jen rolled her eyes.</p><p>“Please, like you’re not both obsessed with each other.”</p><p>“Jen, enough,” Alice insisted.</p><p>“Listen to your girlfriend,” Lilia said as she too approached in an elegant yet summery gown. “Let the lovebirds work this out by themselves.”</p><p>Rio smiled. Finally. A voice of reason.</p><p>“Are you two ready to leave now?” Alice asked, checking her watch. “We’re getting close to being late territory.”</p><p>“Aren’t rockstars notoriously late?” Lilia questioned.</p><p>“Ones without manners, maybe,” Alice replied. “I on the other hand like to not be fashionably late for a dinner reservation. So we need to go now.”</p><p>“I second that.”</p><p>They all looked round to see Agatha stood at the bottom of the stairs. Rio’s breath caught in her throat.</p><p>Agatha was a vision.</p><p>She was wearing a flowing black dress, one that granted a perfect view of her gorgeous chest and toned arms, making Rio feel like a Victorian man who’d seen a woman’s ankle for the first time. And her hair. Her fucking hair curled so naturally as it flowed over her shoulders. She was a true vision. A goddess Rio pledged her life to worship.</p><p>“Well?” She questioned the group as she approached them. “Go enjoy your meal before I call down there myself and make sure you’re put in the kid’s area.”</p><p>“Chill, Harkness,” Jen said as the trio began to head for the door. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d think you wanted rid of us.”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha told her. “Now leave.”</p><p>Their friends said their goodbyes as they did indeed finally leave, the door swinging shut behind them, leaving Rio alone with the embodiment of beauty.</p><p>Agatha looked to her and smiled. “Alone at last.”</p><p>Rio’s heart beat hard in her chest as she smiled back at her. “Alone at last.”</p><p> </p><p>While only Spaghetti and a tomato-based sauce (because of course little miss protect the oceans wasn’t going to put meat in there), somehow Rio had managed to make it taste really fucking good. The spaghetti was cooked just right, and the sauce had a delicious creamy texture while also having sharp flavours that tingled her tongue.</p><p>Rio explained she learnt most of her cooking skills from her time growing up in hotels. “I can pretty much do anything. I know how to strip and dress a bed correctly, how to clean, how to cook most of the old menus. I even used to bellhop some days. That was fun. I used to ride those trollies like a skateboard. Then my mom caught me, and I ended up in so much trouble. I’ve always wanted to do it again, though.”</p><p>“Why not?” Agatha questioned before polishing off the last of her spaghetti. “You do own the hotels. Technically they’re your trollies now.”</p><p>Rio chuckled and set her own cutlery down also. “That’s true, but I’ve never got round to it. And I guess I wouldn’t be setting the best example for my employees.”</p><p>Agatha nodded in agreement, while a niggling thought appeared in her mind. “Speaking of employees, have you heard any more from Honey?”</p><p>“No,” Rio answered. “I think she got the message.”</p><p>Agatha very much doubted that. “I know you can’t fire her, but I’m concerned is all. She’s very young and pretty and she seems very determined.”</p><p>“I can handle it,” Rio promised. “Nothing will ever happen. There is only woman I’m interested in, and it certainly isn’t my project assistant.”</p><p>Agatha smiled but passed it off as teasing with a quipped eyebrow. “Oh really?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I’m a one woman woman.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha reached for her glass of wine. “Shall we move over to the couch?”</p><p>“Sure, just let me do the dishes…”</p><p>“No dishes,” Agatha insisted. “I’ll help you do it tomorrow. Come on, I don’t want to waste any of this peace and quiet before dumb, dumber and dumbest come back.”</p><p>“Agatha, you can’t talk about your godmother like that,” Rio said disapprovingly, but followed her to the couch all the same.</p><p>Agatha sat down and Rio settled on the next cushion. Too far away for her liking. “Come closer.”</p><p>Rio shuffled a little closer and Agatha moved the rest of the way, until they were truly side by side.</p><p>“Much better.” Agatha reached up and tucked a strand of hair behind Rio’s ear. “So, about last night…”</p><p>She noticed Rio swallow sharply. “It was certainly a surprise.”</p><p>“It was,” Agatha agreed, before deciding to take the plunge. “I got jealous.”</p><p>“Jealous?” Rio frowned. “Of what?”</p><p>“Honey. Not how you’re thinking. I know I am the much superior choice.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Alright, then why?”</p><p>Agatha took Rio’s wineglass and set it on the coffee table along with her own. She met Rio’s curious gaze with a deep stare. “Because she’s not scared. Because she’s so forward. Because she can admit she wants you.”</p><p>She heard Rio’s voice catch in her throat. “Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t wait anymore. She leaned in, closing the gap between them. Their lips were mere inches apart, so close to finally meeting…</p><p>Rio pulled back. “Wait.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her. “Wait?”</p><p>Before she could think too much into it, Rio’s lips were against hers. Agatha’s eyes fluttered shut and she sank into what was without a doubt the most sensual kiss of her life. Her hands reached up to cup Rio’s cheeks, whose own fingers she could feel playing with the back of her hair.</p><p>She never wanted to the kiss to end, but soon it did. Slow and gentle, Rio pulled back to stare at her with those big brown eyes.</p><p>“Sorry,” she said breathlessly. “I had to kiss you first.”</p><p>This. Fucking. Loser.</p><p>Agatha was on her in an instant, climbing on top of her and devouring her lips like a woman starved. In a way she was. All those months of annoyance and ridiculous courting, and the nights of watching that damn video of her over and over to scratch an itch she was never able to fully satisfy. Months of texts and stolen glances and dinners and mixed-up coffee. Of vespa rides and meddling friends and Roman ruins and eager assistants.</p><p>Finally, she was here. She could let go.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio,” she said between kisses. “I’ve needed you for so long.”</p><p>“You have?” Rio’s voice was filled with awe, and it made Agatha kiss her even harder.</p><p>“You’ve put a spell on me,” she whispered against her lips. “I can’t get you out of my head.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “You’ve been stuck in mine since the moment I saw you.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and ground her hips against her. “Please, Rio. I need you. I need you so fucking bad.”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Rio asked. “We can wait.”</p><p>“I’m done waiting.” Agatha’s hands moved the waistband of Rio’s pants. “I need it now.”</p><p>Her fingers were so close. So close to popping the button of Rio’s pants she could get her hand underneath and make Rio lose control. Fuck that stupid deal. She wanted Rio to fucking <em>take</em> her.</p><p>Then, just as she finally popped the button free, the front door swung open with a bang.</p><p>“You’re a fucking bitch, Alice. I fucking hate you.”</p><p>Agatha groaned and buried her head in Rio’s neck. This couldn’t be happening.</p><p>She slowly slid off Rio and looked to see Jen storming into the room, Lilia close behind.</p><p>“Jennifer, please calm down.”</p><p>“Why the fuck should I? I caught my girlfriend flirting with the waitress!”</p><p>Agatha put her head in her hands. This was a nightmare.</p><p>“She wanted my autograph!” Alice argued as she too stormed into the room. “You’re so fucking insecure. You couldn’t even handle me hugging my best friend earlier and now this!”</p><p>Agatha had to admit she’d hadn’t liked that either. Not that she saw Alice as a threat, but she hated seeing someone else touch Rio when she had denied herself of it for too long.</p><p>“I can’t deal with this.” Jen marched towards the stairs. “You can room with Rio tonight. I want nothing to do with you.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha began to protest. “You can’t just…”</p><p>“Fine!” Alice interrupted, before looking to Rio. “Is that okay?”</p><p>“Sure.” Rio looked to Agatha apologetically. “Go ahead. I’ll meet you up there.”</p><p>Alice headed upstairs, shoulders slumped with clear upset. Agatha almost felt sorry for her. Almost.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Rio took her hand. “Bad timing, I guess.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “The worst.”</p><p>“Maybe we could take another trip together? Back to Rome or we could go to my own villa. It would give us time alone, and time to talk.”</p><p>Agatha managed a smile. “I’d like that.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward and kissed her cheek. “I better go check Alice is okay. I’ll see you in the morning, okay?”</p><p>“See you in the morning,” Agatha repeated, before watching her walk off towards the stairs. When Rio disappeared from view, she flopped back on the couch. That damn fish talk would have to sate her for yet another night.</p><p>“It seems you two had a good time,” Lilia commented as she surveyed her kitchen. “Now get this mess cleaned up before we get ants.”</p><p>Agatha groaned in frustration. She needed to get away from this fucking villa.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio woke up to Alice sprawled across the bed, pushing her to the edge of the mattress. She listened to her friend’s light snoring as her mind wandered to the night before. Despite the wonderous start to the evening, she had spent the rest of it in her room consoling a heartbroken Alice, who was yo-yoing between insisting her innocence and crying hysterically.</p><p>Rio had been the good friend. She had spent the night comforting her best friend until she eventually calmed enough for them to sleep, all the while mourning what could have been. If she and Agatha had made it upstairs, if they had spent the night in an entanglement of limbs, if they had been able to fall asleep in each other’s arms. The start of their forever.</p><p>Yet here she was with Alice Wu-Gulliver’s foot pressed against her butt and a crick in her neck.</p><p>Sliding slowly out of bed, she crept to the bathroom and started going through her morning routine. The day before she had rushed through it as not to waste the rest of the day, yet it was barely after five, and she had hours of interrupted alone time to enjoy. Even if she had to spend it in a bathroom.</p><p>She was sat on the edge of the bath going through her work emails when there was a light knock at the door. Agatha’s door.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>She moved without hesitation, opening the door to the adjoining room and coming face to face with Agatha Harkness.</p><p>Rio took in her creased pyjamas and serious bedhead with a bright smile. Somehow, Agatha was always perfect.</p><p>“Good morning.”</p><p>“Good morning,” Agatha repeated. “I thought it was you moving around in there.”</p><p>“Yeah, Alice is still asleep, so I went to get out of the way. Sorry if I woke you up.”</p><p>“It’s fine. Why don’t you wait in my room while I get sorted, then we can hide away in there until our chaotic housemates wake up.”</p><p>Rio nodded and moved aside to let Agatha in before stepping into the adjoining room.</p><p>Agatha’s bedroom was pretty much a mirror of her own. Minus the snoring rockstar that is. Rio perched on the edge of the bed, trying hard not to look at the clothes scattered around the room, and particularly not at the bra peeking out of her suitcase. She continued going through her phone until Agatha emerged from the bathroom.</p><p>She walked past Rio and snuck a look at her phone. “Are you working?”</p><p>“Not really.” Rio closed her emails and smiled at Agatha. “Hi.”</p><p>“Hi.” Agatha sat at the other end of the bed, propping herself up with pillows. She patted the space beside her. “Come on, then.”</p><p>Rio scooted up the bed until they were sat side by side.</p><p>“So,” Agatha spoke up again. “What actually happened at the hotel?”</p><p>“According to Alice, one of the waitresses kept trying to talk to her, saying she was a big fan, then when she got up to go to the bathroom, she asked for Alice to sign her order pad. Jen saw them and accused her of giving out her number. When Alice denied it, she said she was lying and stormed out.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “I’ll talk to Jen.”</p><p>“I do understand why she was concerned though. Alice may be my best friend, but she does have a lot of fans. Some of the edits of her on TikTok are full on thirst traps.”</p><p>Agatha grimaced. “I don’t even want to know.”</p><p>“Carol sends me them when she’s drunk,” Rio admitted. “But I can see why Jen might be a little paranoid. It can’t be easy dating a rockstar.”</p><p>“And what’s it like dating a successful hotelier?” Agatha teased. “Is it hard to keep up with all that glitz and glamour?”</p><p>Rio laughed softly. “Nah, I try to stay away from that whole richy rich lifestyle.”</p><p>Agatha laughed loudly. “Please. You bought me a Cartier bracelet after meeting me twice.”</p><p>“That was different,” Rio insisted. “I’m not usually so flashy with the cash. Sure, I have nice homes and nice clothes, but I don’t need a fleet of Lamborghinis and a supermodel on each arm. Honestly, I can’t imagine anything worse.”</p><p>“So if I asked for a lambo, you wouldn’t buy me one?”</p><p>“I’d buy you twenty.”</p><p>Agatha laughed again. “This is what I mean. You’re stupid rich.”</p><p>“Only when it comes to you,” Rio admitted, and watched as Agatha tilted her head.</p><p>“Do you think we can sort this misunderstanding out by tonight so we can finally use that adjoining door to our advantage?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “You mean to…”</p><p>“Yes, Rio. For that.”</p><p>Huh.</p><p>Rio cautiously glanced around. “Everyone else won’t be up for hours. We could make the most of it?”</p><p>“That’s true, but I don’t want the first time we have sex be with this bedhead.”</p><p>Rio pouted “But the bedhead is sexy.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “How about we make out instead?”</p><p>Rio would never say no to that.</p><p>The moment their lips met, Rio’s entire body ignited.</p><p>Every cell in her body wanted Agatha. Every strand of DNA crying out for her. And every one of her senses took in every aspect of the kiss. Her eyes fluttered closed having admired Agatha’s beauty, her nose flared with the scent of her, her tongue relishing the taste of her while her ears took in every little pleasured breath, but the most exhilarating was touch.</p><p>The feel of her mouth and lips, and as she moved over Agatha and pressed her back against the pillows, her hands met the soft skin of her hips, before trailing upwards up the sides of her stomach.</p><p>“Higher,” Agatha demanded between kisses. “I need you higher.”</p><p>Rio could never deny her a thing. Her hand slid upwards, teasing the edge of her already rode-up pyjama top before slipping under and brushing the underside of her breasts. Her breath caught in her throat as Agatha groaned at the contact.</p><p>She was about to combust. Right there in that bed with Agatha’s tongue in her mouth and her hand up her shirt. And she wouldn’t have it any other way.</p><p>Yet just as she was about to cup her breast fully, to perhaps even pull the shirt up and move her mouth to the precious expanse of skin, there was a light knock at the door.</p><p>“Agatha?” Lilia’s hushed voice called through. “Are you awake?”</p><p>“Fuck.” Agatha cursed under her breath. “Just keep quiet. She’ll go.”</p><p>Lilia knocked louder. “Agatha, wake up. This is important.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and pushed Rio back. “Go hide in the bathroom. I’ll get rid of her.”</p><p>Rio nodded and rushed into the bathroom, shutting the door and switching off the light. She pressed against the door in the pitch black, listening as Agatha let her godmother into the room.</p><p>“Lilia, it’s fucking early.”</p><p>“I know, but I can hardly sleep. I witnessed the most ridiculous understanding of my life, and we need to fix it.”</p><p>“Seriously?” Agatha snapped. “You came in here at this time to discuss Jen’s fucking love life?”</p><p>“Come on, Agatha. Alice clearly loves Jen, and Jen clearly loves Alice. We have to fix this.”</p><p>Rio heard Agatha sigh. “Fine, leave it with me.”</p><p>“But why don’t we both…”</p><p>“Leave it with me and let me go back to bed,” Agatha huffed. “If I can even get back to sleep.”</p><p>She heard Agatha send Lilia on her way and backed up in time for the bathroom door to open.</p><p>“Did you catch all that?”</p><p>“Yep.” Rio stepped back into the room. “So we’re going to help them get back together?”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “If it’s the price for me finally getting laid then I suppose we must.”</p><p>Rio tried her hardest not to blush. “So you talk to Jen and I talk to Alice?”</p><p>“Or we lock them in a closet until they stop fighting?” Agatha suggested. “That would be so much easier.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“Fine,” she huffed. “But if we don’t get them back together by tonight, we’re going to Rome first thing. You, me, and that ridiculous hotel suite of yours. And no separate rooms this time, Vidal. No matter what, within the next forty-eight hours, your mine.”</p><p>“I’m always yours,” Rio said, “but I understand. I will look at flights just in case.”</p><p>Agatha patted her cheek. “Good girl. Now, go back to Alice and have a morning debrief. Talk her up, or whatever it is you guys do. I’ll come up for a plan to get Jen on side, and we’ll regroup at breakfast.”</p><p>Rio nodded in understanding. “Sounds like a plan.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha hated this fucking plan.</p><p>She should have insisted Rio take her to Rome that very moment, or persuaded her to rent a nearby villa, or even to run away to that mysterious Lake Como villa of hers. But no, instead she was laid on Jen’s bed, listening to her complain while she went through her morning routine. </p><p>“It’s like she doesn’t consider my feelings. Sure, she’s a rockstar and she has all these fans, but she’s my girlfriend. I should always come first.”</p><p>“You knew this was a part of the deal from the start,” Agatha pointed out. “And again, she was just signing her an autograph.”</p><p>“Or so she says,” Jen countered. “You don’t get it. Rio fucking worships you. It’s taken a year of playing hard to get for Alice to ask me to be official.”</p><p>“Official? What are we? Back at school?”</p><p>Jen shot her a glare. “You know, you don’t know how lucky you’ve got it.”</p><p>“Me? Oh yes, I’ve always had it so <em>lucky</em>.”</p><p>Jen sighed. “I’m not talking about that. I’m talking about Rio. You know she’s locked in, right? I mean, she bought that engagement ring…”</p><p>“Shush!” Agatha cautiously looked to the door. “I don’t want anyone knowing I know.”</p><p>“Hey neither do I,” Jen insisted. “Alice will kill me.”</p><p>“Oh, so you want to be on her good side now?”</p><p>“Duh. I’m not breaking up with her. I just want her to put me first.”</p><p>“She was signing an autograph.”</p><p>“Anyway, about Rio…”</p><p>Agatha rolled onto her back and covered her face. She wanted to burn the fucking villa to the ground.</p><p>“Why don’t you just go for it?” Jen encouraged. “Get the ring, get the fortune, get the girl.”</p><p>“I don’t want her fortune,” Agatha was quick to insist. “I don’t want that life again.”</p><p>“But it would be different this time,” Jen insisted. “Rio isn’t your mom.”</p><p>“I know that, but that’s not the point. No matter what, there will be people in that ridiculous rich social circle that already know who I am. People like Eleanor Bishop who look down at me and whisper behind my back. People who will always see me as…” She couldn’t even manage the words, but she knew Jen understood. “Rio looks at me like I put the stars in the sky, but I worry if I were to just dive straight in, she’d regret it. I’ll muddy her family name. I’ll affect her reputation. I went to Rome with her, and I saw how hard she’d worked to make that hotel fucking perfect. Sure, she’s an heiress, but she works her ass off to build something amazing. I can’t just go in and ruin all that.”</p><p>Jen stared at her for a moment before shaking your head. “You’re a fucking idiot, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“Rio is richer than Eleanor Bishop. Like ten times over. She’s got so many investments and assets that she’d be on fucking Elon Musk level if she wasn’t so set on being fucking green. Sure, they’ll be judgy because that’s who you are, but they can’t do anything to Rio because Rio doesn’t care. She only cares about you. It’s blatantly fucking obvious, just as it is that you like her back. So can we just skip this whole ‘I don’t know if I want her’ bullshit and just get with her already!”</p><p>Agatha wanted to argue. Wanted to throw the kisses in Jen’s face and reveal that it was her antics getting in the way of her finally getting her hands on Rio Vidal. Yet she was never one to let an opportunity go, especially when it landed so perfectly in her lap.</p><p>“Then can we also skip this bullshit and you make up with Alice so we can all continue our holiday in peace.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “Why do you think I’m getting all dressed up to sit round the pool?”</p><p>Agatha was so done with this mess.</p><p> </p><p>Rio managed to persuade Alice to get out of bed and change into their swimsuits and cover-ups. They headed downstairs to find Agatha, Jen and Lilia already sat around the table.</p><p>Jen turned in her chair to look at them, and Rio braced herself for the oncoming verbal assault. Yet she watched in shock as Jen pulled out the chair beside her. “Come sit here, babe.”</p><p>Alice gave Rio a nervous glance before cautiously sitting in the offered seat. Rio quickly moved to take the seat beside Agatha, subconsciously holding her breath as she waited for the next move.</p><p>Jen reached over and put a croissant on Alice’s plate. “There you go.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Alice picked up the croissant and took a slow bite. All seemed okay. She gave Rio a consider look, who shrugged in response. If Jen wanted to pretend like it never happened, it was better just to go with it.</p><p>She reached out for her own pastry, yet just as she pulled it back towards her plate, a sly hand bushed against the bare skin of her inner thigh. She flinched, the croissant dropping out of her hand and landing against her plate with a clatter.</p><p>Four pairs of eyes looked her way, three in concern and</p><p>“You alright?” Alice asked and Rio quickly nodded.</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“Just clumsy,” Agatha added with a smirk. Rio crossed her legs and took a bite of her croissant and remained quiet for the rest of the meal.</p><p>After breakfast they all headed out round the pool. Rio quickly jumped in the water, feeling Agatha’s gaze on her the moment she took her cover-up off. She paddled around for a while, half listening to the group’s chatter as she enjoyed her water time.</p><p>“We’re heading to the shore,” Lilia announced, Alice and Jen readying themselves for the trip. “We won’t be long.”</p><p>“Take as long as you need,” Agatha said as she took off her own cover-up. “Enjoy the scenery.”</p><p>The moment they left, Agatha sat on the edge of the pool. “Mind if I join you?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Not at all.”</p><p>She watched as Agatha dropped into the pool, resting her arms against the edge as her eyes fixed on Rio intensely. “So, we’re on for tonight?”</p><p>Rio paddled forward, stopping a short space away from her. “Your room or mine?”</p><p>“Mine, obviously.”</p><p>“Obviously.” Rio bit her lip before smirking. “We are alone right now, though. Might as well take advantage of it.”</p><p>Agatha pushed off the side without hesitation and moved through the water towards her. Rio grasped her as soon as she was close enough, pulling her into her arms. She felt Agatha’s legs wrap around her waist while her arms laced around her neck.</p><p>Their lips met instinctively, and once again, Rio couldn’t get enough.</p><p>She imagined a day when kisses were just apart of their language. When they’d say hello and goodbye with a peck on the lips, how they’d seal good morning and goodnight with a lingering kiss, and make out shamelessly on the couch while watching trash TV. Perhaps one day, they’d steal kisses when they’re child napped and embarrassed them in their teenage years by still being unable to keep their hands off each other.</p><p>She tried to focus on the present though. Savoured the touch of her lips and the sound of her pleasured moans…until the opening chords of Hotel California cut through the air.</p><p>Rio quickly pulled away. “Shit, that’s a work number.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Your work numbers have a different ringtone?”</p><p>“Yeah, I personalise all my ringtones,” Rio said as she swam to the edge. “Alice’s is her cover of The Ballad of the Witches’ Road, Carol’s is Danger Zone.”</p><p>“What’s mine?”</p><p>“Wicked Game.” Rio pulled herself out of the pool. “The Chris Isaak version.”</p><p>“Really? Why?”</p><p>“Reminds me of you.” Rio checked the ID. “It’s Honey.”</p><p>Agatha paddled back to the edge of the pool. “Put it on speaker.”</p><p>Rio answered and pressed the speaker button. “Hey Honey.”</p><p>“<em>Hey Boss,”</em> Honey’s voice replied. <em>“How’s Sicily?”</em></p><p>Rio gave Agatha a smile. “Very nice, thank you. So, what’s up?”</p><p>
<em>“I was wondering when you were going to be back in town. I mean, I’m holding the fort, but it’s not the same without our commander and chief.”</em>
</p><p>Agatha pulled herself out of the pool and started drying herself off. Rio tried not to get distracted, but that was near impossible.</p><p>“I will stop by at least one more time,” she answered. “But I’m heading back to New York soon.”</p><p>Agatha looked to her in surprise, but Rio ignored it, instead focusing on Honey’s reply.</p><p>
<em>“But we need you here, and I don’t know how long I can put off the mayor. Maybe we could go to dinner with him and his wife? I can be quite charming, you know.”</em>
</p><p>Rio was about to respond professionally, but she was quickly cut off.</p><p>“Hey hot stuff, have you seen my shirt?” Agatha asked loudly, dramatically looking around before spotting the cover-up right where she’d left it. “Oh, it’s on the bed.”</p><p><em>“Oh Rio, I’m so sorry,”</em> Honey began to babble. <em>“I’ll, erm, I’ll talk to you soon.”</em></p><p>“Okay, Honey. Speak soon.”</p><p>The call ended, and Rio looked to Agatha with raised eyebrows. “Okay, I can see the jealousy now.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Shut up. No, talk. You’re coming back to New York?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “It is where the company headquarters is.”</p><p>“I know but are you coming back for good?”</p><p>“I’ll never be back for good,” Rio explained. “It’s my base, but I’m often here, there and everywhere.”</p><p>“No, I mean are you coming back with me?” Agatha specified. “Or rather for me?”</p><p>Rio took a cautious step forward. “That may be part of the equation.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and shook her head. “You’re such a loser.”</p><p>“A loser you want to…”</p><p>“Finish that and you’re never touching my boobs. Ever.”</p><p>Rio held up her hands. “Okay, I surrender.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled softly. “You’re lucky you’re hot.”</p><p>Rio smirked as they leaned in, ready to share another earth-shattering kiss. Their lips were mere milometers apart when the shouts met their ears.</p><p>“FUCK YOU, JEN!”</p><p>“FUCK ME?! FUCK YOU!”</p><p>Oh great.</p><p>Agatha put her hands on her hips. “Seriously?”</p><p>Lilia came out holding a bottle of vodka. “I need the hard stuff.”</p><p>“What the fuck happened?” Agatha asked as the shouting match continued inside. “They were fine when you left.”</p><p>“They weren’t fine, they were avoiding.” Lilia took a shot right from the bottle. “One little disagreement on what flavour chips they wanted and here we are again.”</p><p>Rio wanted to scream. “What are the arguing about now?”</p><p>“Alice accused Jen of being possessive.”</p><p>Agatha nudged Rio. “Why’s your guy going rogue?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I wish she wouldn’t!”</p><p>“Let them hash it out,” Lilia suggested. “They’ll sort things out.”</p><p>The sound of something smashing rang from the house, and Lilia was inside like a shot. “That sounded expensive.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “I’m not dealing with this.”</p><p>“Get those plane tickets booked,” Agatha said as she moved to lie down on her sun-bed. “We need an escape.”</p><p>Rio jumped back in the pool and stayed there until Alice came storming out of the house.</p><p>“Rio, I’ve called Nat and Yelena. I’m flying out to meet their yacht in Santorini. They said you’re welcome too.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, who was peering at her over her book. “I’m gonna stay.”</p><p>“I told them as much.” Alice gave Rio a sad smile. “If you change your mind, give us a call.”</p><p>Rio nodded, though she knew she wouldn’t. “Take care, dude.”</p><p>“Thanks, you too.” Alice stole a glance Agatha’s way. “And good luck.”</p><p>Alice said a quick goodbye to Agatha before heading back through the villa one last time. Rio tried not to be sad. She’d see Alice again soon, but she always missed her partner in crime. Yet her departure inspired her to see through a plan that had been bouncing around in her head for a while.</p><p>And so, she swam across the pool and propped herself on the edge in front of Agatha.</p><p>“How about we don’t go to Rome?” she suggested. “How about we go to my villa? I’ve been a few times since I’ve been out here, so it’s all opened up and ready. It’s nice, quiet, private. We don’t have to stay long. Maybe a few days. I can book Jen and Lilia in at my Milan hotel so they can go shop. It might be nice. So what do you think?”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, considering her words, and Rio waited nervously for her answer.</p><p>“Does the bedroom have a good view?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “The best in the house.”</p><p>Agatha closed her book and got to her feet. “Then I’d better start packing.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The flight to Milan took slightly longer than the one to Rome, but it might as well have been the distance to Australia. </p><p>Agatha’s plan had been to read her book and attempt not to think about the fact she was hopefully having sex later. But she had ended up sat next to Jen, and so she was stuck listening to her tale of woe.</p><p>“So she’s just gone off with her friends and knowing them they’ll have a yacht full of models and she’ll be doing who knows what with who knows who. Meanwhile, <em>I’m</em> here not knowing what to do in total misery.”</p><p>“Okay first off, we’re sitting first class on the way to Milan, where you and Lilia are going to, and I quote, ‘shop until you drop’. And secondly, if you weren’t so dramatic about her signing an autograph, you wouldn’t be in this mess!”</p><p>“Says the woman who has a vendetta against Rio’s assistant.”</p><p>The thought of <em>Honey</em> made her blood boil. “That’s different.”</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“It just is.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes. “Whatever. I’ll find someone else.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t dignify that with a response. If adult Jen was anything like she was in school, she’d pine after Alice in the most pathetic way and make sure it was everyone else’s problem.</p><p>Instead, she looked over to where Rio and Lilia were playing cards. It looked like Rio had the upper hand, but Lilia was sneakily good at card games. Agatha always used to accuse her of hiding cards up her sleeve, or insist she was using some kind of witchy power to win the game. She still hadn’t ruled out either.</p><p>Sure enough, Lilia laid down her cards and Rio dropped hers in defeat, laughing all the same. Agatha couldn’t help but smile. How this bizarre person had fallen into her life she did not know, and why she had instantly decided she was the love of her life was also beyond her. Not long ago, she resented Rio’s sudden presence in her life, but that had changed. Now, she couldn’t help but be grateful.</p><p>She then noticed another deck of cards sliding out of Lilia’s bag.</p><p>“Nope.” She called across the cabin, earning her some confused glances. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“It’s just a quick fortune,” Lilia insisted. “What’s the problem?”</p><p>“Because they’re either freakishly accurate or makes everyone paranoid. Put them away.”</p><p>Lilia sighed and put them back in her bag. “Maybe next time, Rio.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha and gave her a bright smile. One she didn’t stop herself from returning.</p><p>The flight eventually ended, and after getting through security and baggage claim, they made their way to arrivals. There, they found two suited men waiting for them, one holding a sign reading ‘Vidal’.</p><p>Rio gave them both a high five and one of them gave her a set of car keys in return.</p><p>“Thanks guys. Make sure these two get to their hotel safe, okay?”</p><p>“Si Signora.” They took Jen and Lilia’s bags and led them to the exit.</p><p>Rio took Agatha’s suitcase along with her own and led her in a similar direction, yet while her godmother and friend were led into a black Mercedes, it seemed her host had a different idea of transportation.</p><p>“Another vintage car?”</p><p>“A 1963 Alfa Romeo 2600 Spider,” Rio answered with pride as she put their luggage in the trunk. “Isn’t she a beauty?”</p><p>Agatha had to admit it was a pretty car. The kind of car you’d see in old movies driving down the Mediterranean coast.</p><p>They both climbed in, and Agatha waited until they were out of the airport and heading north before broaching the subject again.</p><p>“So what’s with all the fancy cars?” she asked. “First the Ferrari, now this. Do you have a whole fleet of them scattered around?”</p><p>“Okay, I admit the Ferrari was an impulse buy, but I was fed up of being in Rome and it cheered me up.”</p><p>“Fed up of being in Rome? That’s definitely a rich person issue.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I missed my friends, and I missed…Victoria.”</p><p>“And me,” Agatha added.</p><p>“Yes, definitely you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled to herself. “So what about this one?”</p><p>“This?” Rio ran her hand over the dash. “This was my dad’s.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her in surprise. “It was?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “He got her a few years before he died. I like to keep her in tiptop shape, though she only really gets a run out when I’m up here. He got her for the villa.”</p><p>Agatha looked around the car, her perception of it instantly changing. “So your dad owned the villa?”</p><p>“Didn’t I tell you that?”</p><p>Maybe she had, but probably back when she was playing disinterested and chose not to listen. Now, it was a previous nugget of information.</p><p>“Was this like your family home then?”</p><p>“I never had a ‘home’ per say, but I guess this is a close second. We’d spend weeks here in the summers. I have a lot of good memories here.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but note the irony. Rio had no true home yet was loved and adored, while her family home was a house of horrors. A place she could only escape thanks to her mother’s death, while Rio lost what sense home she knew when she lost her parents. What a tragic pair they made.</p><p>“So I need to warn you,” Rio began, “the house is a bit…ornate.”</p><p>“Ornate?” Agatha raised her eyebrows. “What does that mean?”</p><p>“It means it…look, I know you don’t like the rich stuff and that’s why I was reluctant to bring you here. But no matter how it looks, I’m bringing you here so we can be together. Not to impress you in any way. I just want you to know that.”</p><p>“Okay so you’ve definitely raised my expectations so I’m sure to be disappointed now.”</p><p>Rio glanced at her sceptically. “Alright, just try not to freak out, okay?”</p><p>“Don’t you worry,” Agatha teased. “I will prepare myself accordingly.”</p><p>Yet realistically, nothing could have prepared her for this.</p><p>The house was initially hidden by the surrounding landscape, of lake houses and trees and tall walls offering privacy to the millionaire residents. Rio pulled off the road down a slip along the side of a tall yellow wall, before making her way through secure automatic gates. They found themselves in an enclosed courtyard, and Rio quickly pulled the car into a garage that was clearly newer than the rest of their surroundings but generally in keeping with the architecture.</p><p>“Right,” Rio smiled. “We’re here,”</p><p>Agatha could smell fresh water in the air, so she knew the lake was near. Still, she couldn’t see anything other than the courtyard, and she foolishly thought that perhaps the villa was indeed quite simplistic. A small house on the water’s edge with a view that made up for it’s simplicity.</p><p>Yet when Rio led her through an arched gateway, Agatha found her assumption to be completely wrong.</p><p>The house stood against the lake and faraway mountains, a square facade covered in windows and a large entrance, surrounded by luscious gardens. The warm cream walls glowed in the sun, and Agatha couldn’t help but find herself totally mystified. It was like something out of a movie, like Maria arriving at the Von Trapp house for the first time, or an extravagant exterior shot for a setting in a Bond film.</p><p>“Holy shit.”</p><p>“My dad spent a lot of time restoring it,” Rio admitted. “I like to keep it maintained.”</p><p>And maintained it was. As they walked to the house, Agatha saw it in practice. The gardens were trimmed and pruned to perfection, with not a single blade of grass out of place. “This is more impressive than the White House gardens.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “That’s not hard.”</p><p>Once they reached the house, Rio carried their luggage inside before looking back at her with a grin.</p><p>“Come on in, M’Lady.”</p><p>Agatha followed her inside, not believing the place could get any more spellbinding. Once again, she was wrong.</p><p>The floor of the entrance hall was covered in fine marble, while the walls were covered in painted mosaics, and framed pictures and paintings, while a grand chandelier dangled down from the ceiling.</p><p>Agatha was in total awe. “Rio, this place is like a palace.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “It was once the home of Dukes and Aristocrats, but that was a long time ago.”</p><p>“When was it built?” Agatha asked, taking every detail.</p><p>“The 16th Century,” Rio noted. “But it has changed a lot since then. Every person that’s lived here has left their mark on this place. It was renamed several times depending on what noble family claimed ownership. Now it’s the Villa Vidal, and I hope it’ll stay that way for years to come.” Rio opened another door. “Come. I’ll give you a tour.”</p><p>Most of the downstairs was like walking through a museum, full of fine art and antique furnishings. Upstairs, however, things started to look a lot more lived in. Sure, those original details were still there, but there were modern touches too, personal touches. Like the old library room had its original bookcases yet now hosted books like Dune and The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo (boy, did she wanted to get her hands on those shelves and fill them up with a selection in keeping with the rooms grandeur). </p><p>Rio carried her suitcase to a room on the second floor and placed it down by the bed. Agatha followed her, admiring the simplicity of the room. There was a small mosaic of a flock of doves in one corner of the ceiling, yet the rest of the room was reasonably plain, besides a painting on the wall opposite the bed depicting what she guessed was Lake Como and the surrounding landscape. </p><p>“Well, this is your room,” Rio announced. “We have adjoining bathrooms again but there’s also one down the hall.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “This is my room?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Her frown deepened. This was not what she had in mind. “So you don’t want to share?”</p><p>Rio bowed her head shyly. “I wanted to give you your own space.”</p><p>God, she wanted her so fucking much.</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, closing the gap between them. “What if I don’t want space?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened and she bit her lip. Agatha swore she had her then, that the other woman would finally pounce on her and finally <em>finally</em> make her see stars. She was sure Rio was going to lean in to kiss her, so much so that she lightly pursed her lips in preparation, until…</p><p>“Come on, I want to show you the gardens.”</p><p>Agatha watched Rio leave the room, both aroused and confused. What the fuck was Rio playing at? She thought the woman wanted her more than anything yet there she was ready for the taking and she wants to show off her gardens?</p><p>She followed her anyway with a frustrated stomp in her step. Rio didn’t seem to notice and led her through some patio doors out into a seating area shadowed by trees.</p><p>“Sometimes we would lunch out here,” she explained. “Between jumping in the pool, which is just over here.”</p><p>Rio led her round to where the pool lay out on the grass. It was bigger than Lilia’s, but nothing overly impressive. The view was much better though, with Lake Como glistening in the sun, while the mountains stood tall against the deep blue sky.</p><p>“I thought you’d have a full-on waterslide,” Agatha joked, and succeeded in making Rio laugh.</p><p>“There is a pool inside too, but it’s more of a bathing pool than a swimming one. But that’s not the only place you can swim. Follow me.”</p><p>Once again, Agatha followed Rio towards the Lake edge and down stone steps to an iron gate. Rio opened the latch, and they stepped out onto a small dock. A jetty stretched out on the water, and Agatha was surprised there wasn’t a fancy boat tethered there waiting.</p><p>“You can swim to the end of the jetty,” Rio told her. “After that, there’s an eighty-metre drop.”</p><p>“Now I want to go nowhere near the water.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Rio assured. “I learnt to swim here.”</p><p>“You did?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “My dad taught me.”</p><p>“My mother paid for an instructor to teach me,” Agatha found herself admitting. “She didn’t want to do it herself.”</p><p>“Most people get an instructor,” Rio pointed out. “Perhaps it wasn’t the best idea to let your three-year-old learn to swim in natural water. Anything could have happened.”</p><p>Agatha agreed. She would certainly never allow Rio to teach their child to swim there…</p><p>….</p><p>….</p><p>Where did that thought come from?</p><p>“Are you hungry?” Rio asked, oblivious to her mind racing. “I can make us some food?”</p><p>“Don’t you have a cook for that?”</p><p>“I have a housekeeper, but I gave her the week off. I wanted us to have some privacy.”</p><p>That was more like it.</p><p>“And what are we going to do with that privacy, I wonder?”</p><p>Rio laughed shyly, her cheeks turning a bright shade of pink. “So, lunch?”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “Lunch sounds good.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio managed to throw together some pretty decent sandwiches with what she had requested her housekeeper to collect for them. She had relented and bought some chicken and bacon and made Agatha a hearty club sandwich with a homemade picked mayo. She herself had the mayo with some leaf vegetables and served both on thick toasted bread. </p><p>Agatha whistled when she carried the plates out. “You should open a sandwich shop.”</p><p>“It’s my retirement plan,” Rio joked as she sat opposite her, and Agatha gave her a dubious look. </p><p>“I don’t think you’ll ever retire.”</p><p>“You don’t?”</p><p>“No, you love your job too much. It’s like your life.”</p><p>“It’s a big part of my life,” Rio admitted. “But not all of it. There are other things.”</p><p>“Like?”</p><p>
<em>You.</em>
</p><p>“My loved ones, WNBA, Arsenal Women, and Victoria of course.”</p><p>Agatha chucked. “You and that spider.”</p><p>“Tarantula,” Rio corrected. “And she’s my baby.”</p><p>“Whatever you say, Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha bit into the sandwich and groaned. “I take that back, you won’t own a sandwich shop. You’ll be my personal chef.”</p><p>Rio laughed and began eating her own lunch. She could get used to this. Her. Agatha. Intimate lunches with small talk and teasing. The thought of leaving her constant company when their vacation ended was almost too painful for bear, and so she savoured every single moment.</p><p>“So,” Agatha set her sandwich down and reached for her drink, “what’s the plan this afternoon?”</p><p>“I thought we could go explore tomorrow, so maybe we should have a chill day today.”</p><p>She watched Agatha smirk. “Are you sure that’s wise?”</p><p>Rio frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I mean I highly doubt we’ll be leaving the bedroom much tomorrow, let alone the villa.”</p><p>“What do you…oh.” Rio cleared her throat. “That’s certainly a good point.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha answered between sips of her drink. “So, we explore today?”</p><p>Rio pulled out her phone. “I’ll make the arrangements.” </p><p>She called ahead and got everything they needed in place. By the time they had changed, their water taxi was waiting for them at the jetty. Agatha, however, didn’t seem too pleased.</p><p>“It won’t take long,” Rio assured. “And it’s perfectly safe.”</p><p>Agatha still climbed into the boat as though she were boarding the Titanic. “If we sink, Vidal, I’m fucking suing the hell out of you.”</p><p>“I’ll save you,” Rio promised. “I’m a confident swimmer.”</p><p>It indeed didn’t take long and when they arrived at their destination, Rio helped Agatha off the boat and led her up the stone steps to dry land.</p><p>The staff knew to let Rio through. She always made at least one visit whenever she stayed on the lake, had supported the landmark vocally and financially for years. And so once through the gate, they headed up to the sun yellow buildings that made up the Villa de Balbianello.</p><p>They explored the villa itself, before wandering the gardens. It was Rio’s favourite part. The layout, the architecture, the trees, the landscaping. If she could, she would have tried to replicate it at her own villa, yet she hated the thought of messing with her parent’s design.</p><p>Agatha also seemed equally fascinated, pointing out features and any wildlife she found interesting as they strolled down the winding paths, until they finally made it to the most infamous spot. That iconic intricately designed walls that looked out onto the water.</p><p>Like always, Rio waited until a group of tourists dispersed before moving to the villa’s most popular spot. She leaned her elbows on the wall and looked out to the river, smiling when Agatha moved next to her.</p><p>“Enjoying your day out so far?”</p><p>“I am,” Agatha admitted. “Though I’m not looking forward to getting into that boat again.”</p><p>“It wasn’t that bad.”</p><p>“We almost capsized.”</p><p>“We were turning a corner.”</p><p>“I know what I saw.”</p><p>Rio suppressed a laugh. Agatha was the most entertaining person she had ever met, though she may be bias. In her wisdom, however, she decided to change the subject.</p><p>“You know Anakin and Padme got married here.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha looked at her, totally lost. “Like in Star Wars?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “You’ve seen Star Wars?”</p><p>“Of course I’ve seen Star Wars, you dork.”</p><p>“Alright, alright. Well, they filmed some shots here for Attack of the Clones. It was a stand in for Naboo. They got married over there, and here is where Anakin did the whole ‘I don’t like sand’ speech.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “The prequels were terrible.”</p><p>“You think so?”</p><p>“You don’t?”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I like them. Sure, they can be a bit clunky, but there are some things I love about them.”</p><p>“Well, I no longer trust your opinion after seeing the state of you book collection.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with them?”</p><p>“What’s right with them?” Agatah countered. “I’m now making it my mission to fill that beautiful library with books worthy of its grandeur, and I want you to read them too.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “Am I getting allocated reading now, Professor?”</p><p>“Yes, I will assign you a book a month. I expect you to read it and give me a detailed review.”</p><p>Rio couldn’t tell if she was joking or not.</p><p>“I just pick up books as and when. If you want to, we can drive to an English bookstore and you can pick me some out, or we can order from Amazon. Your pick.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Like I would ever pass on a bookstore visit.”</p><p>“That’s settled then. I’ll do my research, and we’ll go one day before we leave.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha replied. “Just not tomorrow.”</p><p>“No,” Rio agreed. “Not tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha looked out at the lake. “I can see why people love it here. It really is beautiful.”</p><p>Rio took in Agatha’s side profile in awe. “Yeah. It definitely is.”</p><p> </p><p>When they headed back to the villa, Agatha helped Rio make dinner, before they ate on the terrace watching the sunset. They chatted, laughed, and simply looked out onto the river, sipping expensive wine as the sun disappeared behind the mountains.</p><p>After dinner, Rio said she had a work call to make- this time to New York which meant either Billy or Harper, or maybe some boring execs. Most importantly, not Honey. It however gave Agatha a chance to explore the place alone, and she knew exactly where she wanted to go.</p><p>Rio had been dismissive of the study, just giving her a peek inside before whisking her off to look at something she deemed more interesting. Yet there was something about the room that peaked her curiosity.</p><p>The room was dark, with an iron chandelier and a big stone fireplace, like something out of Game of Thrones, with brown leather couches and art deco furniture that made her feel like she’d walked into the smoke room in a Bond movie, complete with a drinks cart and whiskey corked in a crystal decanter.</p><p>Agatha poured herself a glass and went to look at what truly caught her eye. Because instead of the fancy art and sculptures that decorated the rest of the home, this room was full of photographs. There was a large picture of a couple on their wedding day, both with dark hair and eyes, and dressed in dated yet clearly expensive attire. The dress was like something Audrey Hepburn would wear, while the man wore a dapper suit. From the age of the photograph, it looked to be from the 1970s, though she may be wrong. All she knew was the woman had Rio’s face, and the man had her eyes, and that was all she needed to know.</p><p>There were several other pictures of the couple scattered around the room in free-standing frames on any convenient flat surface the room had to offer. Yet most of the time, they weren’t alone. Sometimes they were with a baby, other times a grinning toddler, or a grinning child, or a grinning teenager. Always the perfect mix of both of them, with a face Agatha had come to know very well.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She was the main subject of the room. From her baby pictures to being well dressed for events as a confident young woman, the study seemed to be a shrine to her, created by parents who worshipped the ground she walked on. To her, this was proof enough that Rio had been the jewel of the Vidal fortune. The most precious thing in the world.</p><p>Yet the photos stopped at Rio’s adolescence, with the oldest seeming to be Rio and her parents posing outside of what looked an old college building. She guessed this was when they dropped Rio off at college, setting her up for that new chapter in her life.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t looked into how Rio’s parents died. It seemed too intrusive. Yet she did vaguely recall seeing something on the news when she was in boarding school. About the death of a hotelier and his wife, and how they left behind a daughter who would inherit everything yet was now totally alone in the world.</p><p>It shook a lot of the girls up, but Agatha hadn’t thought much about it. She too was an orphan (well part orphan- she had no idea who her father was so he might as well be dead to her too), and despite her sentencing to the pits of hell (an elite all-girls boarding school), her mother’s death had made her freer than she’d ever been. In her mind, the girl would be fine. The girl would be free. The girl would thrive.</p><p>Now that she saw it, what Rio lost, it made her heart ache.</p><p>She heard footsteps and she looked to see the door opening and Rio stepping inside. This Rio was a world away from the Rio that stood awkwardly in dresses and hand little pigtails with tiny ribbons at the end. This Rio wore shorts and a white vest so tight it her pebbled nipples. This Rio’s hair fell in front of her eyes until she pushed it back, her arm muscles on full display as she did.</p><p>Yet they had the same smile, a smile Agatha had somehow become totally enamoured with.</p><p>She pointed to one of the pictures. “You were a cute baby.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Rio picked up a picture of her with Minnie Mouse. She was probably aged around five or six, wearing a plain t-shirt and shorts with a pair of Mickey ears on her head. “My parents said this was when they knew I was a lesbian.”</p><p>“That young?”</p><p>“I wasn’t interested in the rides. I just wanted to look at the princesses, but I wouldn’t dress up like them, and I’d cry when the princes came over and kissed their hands. I kissed Minnie’s hand after this, and she pretended to faint. My dad said my grin was so big it had him laughing for days.”</p><p>“So they were okay with it?”</p><p>“Yeah, I mean there were other signs. I’d refuse to wear dresses, and I always wanted my hair short and I had posters of Sandra Bullock and Winona Ryder instead of Tom Cruise and Leonardo. As I got older, I tried to dress a bit more feminine, but my dad told me to be myself. So that’s what I’ve done ever since. I live my life, I work hard, I help who what I can. Who I am and who I love is less interesting than the quality of my character.”</p><p>“I like that.” Agatha couldn’t help but feel a little envious for how open Rio’s parents had been and wondered what her life would have looked like if she had a mother who loved her enough to at least accept who she was.</p><p>Rio poured herself a glass of whiskey and sat down on one of the couches. Agatha quickly moved to sit next to her, as close as she could get without pretty much sitting on her lap.</p><p>“So, what was the call about?”</p><p>“Billy wanted to update me on some things. He said the Rome hotel is going well, so I’m going to just check in on it one last time before heading back to New York. Speaking of, when is your flight back?”</p><p>“Next week,” Agatha answered. “From Rome.”</p><p>“I can fly back with you then.”</p><p>“We won’t be sat together though.”</p><p>“Send me the details.”</p><p>Agatha forwarded all her flight details and watched as Rio tapped away at her phone before setting it down on the couch arm. She looked to Agatha and took a sip of her whiskey.</p><p>“Did you enjoy today?”</p><p>“I did,” Agatha answered truthfully, though she was more looking forward what was to come.</p><p>“And the villa? It’s not too much, is it?”</p><p>“It’s a lot, but I like it,” Agatha admitted. “Or maybe I just like the company.”</p><p>That made Rio blush, and it gave Agatha the push to finish the rest of her whiskey in one gulp and set the glass down. “I think I’m going to go to bed.”</p><p>“You are?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Oh, okay.”</p><p>Agatha slowly stood. She waited for Rio to do the same, for her to lead her to her bed so they could <em>finally</em>….</p><p>But Rio looked up at her nervously. Awkwardly. Cautiously. Still, she did not move.</p><p>With a sigh, Agatha relented. “Goodnight Rio.”</p><p>“Night Agatha,” Rio said quietly, her eyes big and glistening.</p><p>Agatha turned away from her and left the room. She waited to hear Rio’s footsteps following her, to her voice calling after her, for there to be any sign that her night wasn’t ending alone and frustrated.</p><p>Nothing</p><p>She entered her room and slammed the door shut. She didn’t understand Rio. The woman spends millions and totally fauns at her feet to just go on innocent dates, yet when it came to sex, nothing could encourage her. Did she have to get on her knees and beg? Because she wasn’t far off resorting to such desperate measures.</p><p>With a huff, she took off her clothes and walked into the bathroom in her underwear. She regarded herself in the mirror- at how her body looked in the matching black underwear set.</p><p>The panties hugged her hips just right and the bra complimented her tits perfectly. It even unfastened at the front, something that had encouraged her to buy it. She’d picked them up during a shopping trip with Wanda not long after her last relationship (if she could even call it that) ended, but she hadn’t had opportunity to wear them since. She had been saving them for the right time, and she had figured that night was the night.</p><p>Agatha checked herself out in the mirror. She looked fucking hot. It was Rio’s lose.</p><p>She was about to brush her teeth when the bathroom door swung open. The other door. Rio’s door.</p><p>“OH FUCK!”</p><p>Agatha quickly covered her chest. “RIO!”</p><p>“OH SHIT AGATHA FUCK I’M SORRY!” The door quickly slammed shut again.</p><p>Agatha looked down to where her hands crossed her chest and huffed. She was being ridiculous. She went back to her room and threw on her sleep shirt, before walking back through the bathroom and knocking on Rio’s door.</p><p>“Rio, can I come in?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha pushed open the door. Rio had shown her the master bedroom on her tours, and it was probably the room she saw Rio the most in. Instead of fancy paintings, there was a textured painting of a dinosaur skeleton, and a TV with various consoles plugged in took up one corner.</p><p>Rio, still dressed, stood by the window. She looked over to Agatha, her eyes wide and panicked. “Agatha, I really am so sorry. Usually it’s only me here, or some friends but they always stay upstairs and I completely forgot we were sharing a bathroom again. I’m so sorry, I…”</p><p>Agatha crossed the room and grabbed the front of Rio’s shirt. She yanked her forward and quickly captured her lips with her own. She heard Rio squeal in surprised, but it didn’t take long for her hands to cup her cheeks and pull her closer.</p><p>Soon Rio was taking the lead, kissing her so thoroughly that it made her toes curl. Agatha moaned shamelessly, desire burned within her. She swore she had never been so turned on in her entire life.</p><p>Eventually, they pulled apart, both gasping for air.</p><p>“So you do want me?” Agatha asked and Rio nodded without hesitation.</p><p>“I’ve never wanted anyone else like this.”</p><p>“Then why didn’t you just have me?”</p><p>“I wanted to do it right,” Rio admitted. “I’m worried I’ll mess up.”</p><p>“You won’t,” Agatha assured. “And anyway, I’m a fantastic teacher.”</p><p>“Professor,” Rio corrected before backing her towards the bed. Agatha was ready to make a counter remark, but she soon found herself behind pushed down on the mattress. She looked up to where Rio now loomed over her, their knees pressing together.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip and opened her thighs, allowing Rio to step forward. Brown eyes stared at her so intensely that she had to look down, only for a finger to hook under skin, prompting her to look up once more.</p><p>“You want me too?”</p><p>Agatha just nodded. The question was absurd. How could she not want the fucking vision right in front of her.</p><p>Rio pulled at her shirt and Agatha lifted her arms, and in a swift but gentle movement, her shirt was off. She bit her lip even harder as Rio’s fingertips lightly traced across her arms, then her open thighs, before she gently lowered her onto the bed.</p><p>Agatha threw an arm over her face as Rio crawled over her, and bit back a moan as her soon-to-be lover’s hand traced the length of her body, from her arm to her calf, then right back up again.</p><p>“How are you real?” Rio questioned. “I never imagined anyone could ever be so…spellbinding.”</p><p>“Not perfect then?” Agatha teased, making Rio chuckle.</p><p>“There’s no such thing as perfect, just close to.”</p><p>Agatha stared up at her. “You’re quite philosophical when you want to be.”</p><p>“Thanks?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’m feeling underdressed.”</p><p>Rio frowned and looked down at herself. “Oh. Sorry.”</p><p>Agatha watched as she moved to stand up again, biting her lips as Rio popped the button of her shorts and pushed the fabric downwards, revealing simple white panties. They were nothing fancy, the kind of underwear you could get at Walmart. Yet somehow, they, and the growing patch of wetness at the crotch, were the sexiest thing Agatha had ever seen.</p><p>Yet she wanted more.</p><p>“Still overdressed.”</p><p>“I’m not wearing a bra.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “I can see that.”</p><p>Rio still stood there, her fingers playing with the edge of her vest.<br/>Agatha sighed and unclipped her bra, the cups sliding away to reveal her own chest. “Happy now?”</p><p>Rio quickly pulled off her vest, but Agatha barely got a glimpse before Rio was on top of her again, leaning down to kiss her deeply.</p><p>Agatha quickly wrapped her arms around her and pulled her close. Their chests pressed together, a feeling she revelled in.</p><p>Then Rio’s lips left hers, moving to trail kisses across her chin before descending on her neck. Agatha braced herself to feel her latch on, to bite and suck until she was marked for all to see.</p><p>Yet Rio’s lips continued downwards, across her collarbone then between her breasts before spreading kisses across her stomach. Agatha’s breath hitched in her throat. Rio wasn’t prepping her. Rio was <em>worshipping </em>her. An act that became all the more prevalent when she placed a gentle kiss to her public bone, before her fingers traced the line of her panties.</p><p>“You can take them off,” Agatha said before she could ask. “Please.”</p><p>Her fingers hooked under the material and gently pulled them down her legs. As soon as they were off, Rio settled back into position. She kissed her thighs gently, before finally lowering her head to where it was most desperately needed.</p><p>The first tough was another kiss, this time directly on her clit. It was gentle and quick, but it caused her a spark of pleasure. Agatha groaned. She was so turned on she knew she wouldn’t last long.</p><p>Then Rio’s tongue ran though her folds. One, twice, before dipping inside her on the third. Agatha barely had time to register it before she was overcome with the bright rush of pleasure. She groaned and arched her back, grinding against that talented tongue to ride out her orgasm.</p><p>It was when she finally came down that she realised how quick she’d finished, and embarrassment washed over her. It usually took her at least ten minutes to get even a mediocre orgasm, but Rio had somehow shattered her in less than one. Yet when she looked down between her legs, Rio just looked back at her with those big brown eyes. No sign of smugness. Just pure adoration.</p><p>She had never wanted anyone more.</p><p>Agatha yanked her up and flipped them over so she was on top. It was now she could finally admire Rio’s body. Her muscles she already knew, but her tits were fucking unreal. She cupped one at the side, manoeuvring her thumb to circle her nibble, basking in the sight of her body arching and wriggling for friction.</p><p>“You want me, baby?”</p><p>Rio bit her lip and nodded, and Agatha didn’t hesitate. She yanked Rio’s panties aside and thrust her fingers inside her. She relished the little gasp that left her lover’s lips and chased it with her lips.</p><p>Their lips stayed together as she fucked her, tracking every gasp and moan as she learned what Rio liked. She didn’t like fast or light. No, Rio wanted it slow and deep, with her panties now around her knees and Agatha’s palm kneading against her clit while two fingers worked away inside her.</p><p>“Come for me,” Agatha commanded against her lips. “Let me feel you squeeze me.”</p><p>After a few more thrusts, Rio’s walls clamped around her finger, her head tipping back with pleasure. Agatha smirked to herself. She knew this night wouldn’t be enough. She needed so much more of this.</p><p>Once Rio recovered, she looked up at Agatha like she had performed some kind of miracle. “Fuck, that was…wow.”</p><p>Agatha pulled out and sucked her fingers in her mouth, relishing in the taste. “Fuck, I wish I could ride you.”</p><p>“I don’t have a strap,” Rio admitted, her chest still heaving. Agatha couldn’t help but place a hand over one of her breasts. The left. Right over her heart.</p><p>“There must be a millionaire sex shop round here.” She reached for Rio’s hand. “This will do for now.”</p><p>Rio had long fingers. It wasn’t something she had noticed until she studied them in her hand, and she smirked to herself. These would indeed do nicely.</p><p>She straddled Rio’s waist and brought Rio’s hand to where their crotches met. With some manoeuvring, she managed to slide down onto two of her fingers with ease, moaning loudly when she made it all the way down.</p><p>“How are your fingers so fucking long?”</p><p>Rio chucked. “Are you complaining?”</p><p>“Fuck no.” Agatha raised her hips before lowering herself back down. “Shit, I need another.”</p><p>Rio moved her hand, and the next time Agatha slid down, three fingers entered her. The stretch was addictive, and as Agatha’s movements became quicker, she wished to whatever gods were there to listen that she could stay like this forever. With Rio inside her. Totally complete.</p><p>And when she fell apart, when Rio sat up and held her, rocking her own hips to keep her simulated as she drenched their joined bodies with release, she knew her life could never go back to normal.</p><p>Because in that moment, she couldn’t imagine a future that didn’t include this. Her. Them. Together.</p><p>There was no going back, and she wasn’t sure she wanted to.</p>

<p>When she woke up, Rio thought she had to be dreaming. Like in a scary movie when the final girl wakes up only to have an epic jump scare and jolt awake for real. Only there was no scary monster lurking to pounce, just the rising sun shining through the curtains, and Agatha’s light snores beside her.</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but stare. Agatha looked so peaceful. So beautiful. The sight almost made her heart burst. Their first night together had been perfect and as they lay there, naked in the tangled sheets, it seemed their first morning would be just as beautiful.</p><p>It didn’t take long for Agatha to shift, groaning as she buried her face into the pillow. “Rio, I can feel you staring at me.”</p><p>“Can you blame me?” Rio questioned, a stupid grin on her face. “You look like an angel.”</p><p>“But we both know I’m not,” Agatha said with a sleepy chuckle. “Now, let me sleep a bit more before we start again.”</p><p>Rio left her to it, instead reaching for her phone. There were plenty of notifications, as their usually was. None from Honey, thankfully, but a couple from Billy.</p><p>
<strong>BILLY</strong>
</p><p>
<em>what date are you visiting rome again? they want confirmation.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>BILLY</strong>
</p><p>
<em>also hope you’re having a good time!</em>
</p><p>Rio smiled and typed back.</p><p>
<strong>RIO</strong>
</p><p>
<em>sometime next week. i’ll let them know ahead of my arrival. and yes, i’m having the best time.</em>
</p><p>“You type so loud,” Agatha grumbled. “You better be buying us a strap.”</p><p>Rio giggled. “You seriously want one?”</p><p>“I really fucking want one, Rio, so while I <em>try</em> to sleep, would you be oh so kind as to put those millions to good use so you can fuck me into this mattress.”</p><p>Who was she to say no?</p><p>About half an hour later, Agatha grumbled and sat up. “What time is it?”</p><p>“Just after seven.”</p><p>Agatha grumbled again. “Why are you up so early?”</p><p>“I always wake up early.”</p><p>“You didn’t that day at the villa.”</p><p>“Because you’d kissed me and I couldn’t sleep!”</p><p>An amused smirk appeared on Agatha’s lips. “Oh really?”</p><p>“Yeah, it was all I could think about.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed her lightly. “Will that keep you up all night?”</p><p>“I think I’m cured,” Rio lied. “Your kisses have no power over me.”</p><p>“Oh really?” Agatha crawled over her. “I guess I’ve got to try harder.”</p><p>Rio grinned and eagerly accepted the kiss Agatha pressed passionately against her lips. She could never get enough of this. Ever.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid down her side, before siding between her legs. Rio bit her lip as her finger slid through her folds, rubbing her over and over.</p><p>“So wet for me already.” Agatha smirked. “You want me that bad, huh?”</p><p>“Always,” Rio said without hesitation, and Agatha’s eyes brightened.</p><p>“Good.” She slid her fingers inside her and swallowed her moans with another kiss.</p><p>If Rio wasn’t already weak for the woman already, she certainly was now; unable to do anything but moan into her mouth as she hips rolled with the rhythm of her thrusts.</p><p>“That’s it,” Agatha encouraged. “Show me how much you want me.”</p><p>“I want you,” Rio gasped between moans. “I want you so much.”</p><p>Agatha sped up her thrusts. “I know, hun. You’ve been obsessed with me since day one.”</p><p>“I am,” Rio admitted without a care. “Fuck, you’re amazing.”</p><p>“And you’re a so fucking hot like this.” Agatha groaned. She pulled her fingers out and Rio could barely groan in protest before they were replaced by the warm press of Agatha’s own heat. “Fuck me, Rio.”</p><p>She didn’t need to say it twice. Rio quickly flipped them over. She pressed against her, relishing in the touch before rocking her hips in a firm rhythm.</p><p>Agatha moaned loudly beneath her, and Rio couldn’t help but marvel at the sight of the naked goddess below her. If this was indeed a dream, she never wanted to wake up.</p><p>“You look so good thrusting into me,” Agatha said, already breathless. “I can’t wait for you to strap me.”</p><p>“Me neither,” Rio managed to reply as she rapidly reached her peak. “Fuck, Agatha. I can’t hold it-fuck! Fuck! Agatha, please come for me. Please, I’m sorry. I can’t hold back.”</p><p>“Come for me,” Agatha demanded. “Come all over me.”</p><p>That’s what did it. Rio ground down hard, over and over, until finally she hit her release. In her orgasmic haze she heard two loud moans as wetness surged between them.</p><p>Eventually, she collapsed on top of Agatha, tucking her face into the crook of her neck.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha cursed under her breath. “You’re so good at that.”</p><p>“You’re amazing,” Rio said yet again. “I can’t believe you’re real.”</p><p>She felt Agatha’s arms wrap around her, and Rio smiled. It was set to be the most perfect day.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha sat looking out and the lake, an oversized shirt covering her bikini. When mid-morning hit, Rio persuaded her to get up and have something to eat, though not before they had a long shower that resulted in her being pressed against the marble wall as those deliciously long fingers explored inside her. It was in her post-orgasmic haze that she agreed to go by the pool for the afternoon, and so she sat at the table on the patio, waiting for her lover to bring her a homemade brunch.</p><p>She smiled to herself as she sipped her iced tea, her body humming from the ungodly number of orgasms she had experienced in the last twelve hours. Rio was a sexual maestro; the kind of intimate partner only spoken about in music and literature.  </p><p>It also made her wonder what Rio’s romantic life had been like before. Probably full of models and actresses, and gold diggers that fluttered their eyelashes like her blatantly obvious assistant. Agatha tried to push those thoughts away. Just because most of the rich bachelors she knew were pigs didn’t mean Rio was. And deep down she knew Rio wasn’t. She probably treated them with the upmost respect. Would treat them like a princess. Would bring them to fancy villas and worship them until daybreak. How many women had Rio brought here? Was she just the latest in a long line, or was she as special as Rio always insisted?</p><p>Rio came out of the house carrying two plates piled with pancakes and fruit. “I thought we could have something sweet.”</p><p>Agatha grinned as she was handed the plate and cutlery, her stomach grumbling in anticipation. They were quiet as they tucked in, until the flavours properly met her tongue and she couldn’t help but groan.</p><p>“You’re almost as good at cooking as you are in bed, and that’s a high bar for both.”</p><p>Rio blushed as she ate another mouthful. “You’re too kind.”</p><p>“No, I’m being truthful,” Agatha insisted. “Seriously, the pancakes are amazing, but the sex? Jesus, Rio. I’ve never…it was amazing.”</p><p>Rio grinned dreamily. “It really was.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips. “I guess I have all those models to thank for that.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Models?”</p><p>“Yeah, isn’t that the kind of girls you rich millionaire types go for?”</p><p>Rio’s face crinkled in disgust. “What? No, I’ve never…no.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “Alright, no models. So hot businesswomen?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Celebrities?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Eco-activists?”</p><p>Rio laughed. “No.”</p><p>Agatha covered her face with her hands. “Rio, if you sleep with you assistants…”</p><p>“What?! No! Never!”</p><p>Agatha held her hands up, relieved by Rio’s outrage. “Okay, okay. No employees.”</p><p>“It would be totally unethical.” Rio shifted awkwardly in her chair. “I don’t really do that.”</p><p>“Breech HR regulations?”</p><p>“No, well that too, but I don’t usually have…I don’t have sex. Not really.”</p><p>“Not really?” Agatha folded her arms. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Rio avoided her gaze. “I haven’t had sex much.”</p><p>“Define ‘much’?”</p><p>Rio pushed a blueberry around her plate. “I’ve maybe done it...twice…”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Twice?”</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“Twice as in two times or two people?”</p><p>“Both,” Rio answered. “Two different times with two different people. I mean, not two people at once but…”</p><p>“I understand,” Agatha assured, though that was the only part she did. “So you’ve only had sex twice?”</p><p>“Yes, or rather I had. Now that numbers gone up. Quite a lot if I remember correctly?”</p><p>Agatha tried to ignore the comment, though the growing heat between her legs made it especially difficult. “So tell me about these other two times. How did they happen?”</p><p>“The first time was at a house party when I was about twenty-five. Carol and I were in London, and we went out on the town. We were pretty tipsy when some girl invited us back to a party at her friend’s place, and after that I don’t remember much. What I do remember is Carol waking me up and patting me on the back. Apparently, I’d met this girl and we went into one of the bedrooms and we were, erm, quite loud.”</p><p>Agatha tried to push back the jealously beginning to bubble inside her. “Who was she?”</p><p>“I don’t know. She was gone when I woke up. I spent so many years wondering if she was the one and I’d lost her because I got too drunk and couldn’t remember her face, or name. Carol said she was hot, but apparently just as wasted as me. It was a mistake.”</p><p>“And the second time?”</p><p>“My dad was friends with this Swedish ski resort owner. His daughter was a bit older than me, but we always got on well enough. About a year after the house party, she invited me to ski with her. One night, I told her about what happened, and she offered to give me a night I’d remember. I was curious so I accepted, but when she touched me, I knew it wasn’t right. We never really got going before I tapped out, and she was cool about it. So technically I guess I’d had sex 1.5 times before you.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “How far did you get with your Swedish friend?”</p><p>A deep blush appeared on Rio’s cheeks. “We, erm, kind of dry humped a little and she cupped me over my underwear. That’s when I asked her to stop.”</p><p>“Rio, that’s barely foreplay!”</p><p>“Okay, 1.25 then.”</p><p>“And you don’t remember the girl from the party?”</p><p>“I couldn’t really at the time, let alone fifteen years later.”</p><p>Agatha did the math. “Huh, you’re five years older than me. I mean, I knew you were older, but not that much older.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “Five years is nothing. We’re adults.”</p><p>Agatha figured she was right, still she had so many questions. “I just don’t get it. You’re fucking gorgeous, you’re rich, you’re admittedly quite likeable. Why not play the field? Surely you’ve been on dates before.”</p><p>“Not really. Only to appease my friends, but it never went beyond dinner.”</p><p>“But why?” Agatha questioned. “What were you waiting for?”</p><p>“You.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart leaped in her chest. Lost in the thrill of their lust, she had almost forgotten about the whole ‘soulmates’ thing. Panic began to set in. Oh fuck, what had she done?</p><p>“Rio, I…”</p><p>Before she could find words to respond, Rio’s phone beeped on the table and quickly looked at the screen. “Shit, I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Agatha watched her run into the villa before emerging with a wad of cash in her hand.</p><p>“Rio, what is that for?” Agatha said, watching as Rio rushed towards the lake. It was then she spotted it. A boat glided across the lake in the direction on the villa, swerving to meet the villa’s dock.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha chased after her. “What are you doing?”</p><p>“I have a delivery,” Rio called back as she rushed down the steps to the jetty. “Need to tip the guy.”</p><p>By the time Agatha made it onto the jetty, Rio was handing a young man the cash while holding a black shopping bag in her other hand. She gave the guy a high five before waving him off and walking back towards the shore as the boat sped off back across the lake.</p><p>Agatha waited for her on the steps, her arms folded. “Rio, if that’s drugs I swear down…”</p><p>“I don’t do drugs,” Rio assured as she stepped towards her. “It’s just something I ordered.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows. “By speedboat?”</p><p>“Yep.”</p><p>Agatha eyed the bag suspiciously. “What is it?”</p><p>“Something for later.” Rio walked past her back towards the house. “I’ll go put this away and we can enjoy the rest of our brunch.”</p><p>Agatha stole one more look at the boat, that was now just a speck in the distance, before following Rio back towards the house.</p><p> </p><p>After eating, they settled around the pool. Rio swam lengths like she always did, yet again wishing the pool was bigger. Usually, her mind would be busy going over possible designs for expansion, but instead her attention fixed on the goddess sat on the edge of the pool.</p><p>Agatha sat there in her bikini, her arms propping her up as she leaned back, her skin gleaming in the midday sun. A true vision of Venus.</p><p>Yet Rio could tell something was troubling her. She had been quiet since the delivery, barely saying a word for the rest of brunch, and hadn’t even bothered teasing her about her lengths. As she swam one last lap, she wondered what it could be? It could be the delivery, which Rio would rectify when she revealed what it was, but she wasn’t so sure. Perhaps spilling her limited sexual history was a bit too much.</p><p>Once her length was done, she paddled over to where Agatha sat. “You not coming in?”</p><p>“I didn’t want to get in the way.”</p><p>“You’d never get in the way,” Rio assured, before moving to grip the edge of the pool. “You okay?”</p><p>“I’m good,” Agatha said before biting her lip in contemplation. “I’m just- I’m a bit confused.”</p><p>“Confused?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “You said you waited for me.”</p><p>“I did.”</p><p>“But that’s…you never had a relationship because you were waiting for me? Rio, that’s your whole life wasted.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “You think I wasted my life?”</p><p>“You never had a relationship…”</p><p>“Because I had more important things to focus on,” Rio stated firmly. “I had my studies which I had to finish while grieving my parents and dealing with lawyers and stuff, then I had an international hotel empire to manage and expand, and I have friends that are always getting up to mischief, and so many charities to support and causes to fight. Throw in galas and hotel openings and basketball games and Arsenal matches. Why would I waste my time on relationships I had no interest in when I had all that to do?”</p><p>“You’ve somehow found plenty of time for me now,” Agatha argued, at which Rio chuckled and shook her head.</p><p>“Agatha, I’m a busy woman. I have to triage my time. The most important thing gets my full and immediate attention.”</p><p>“That’s not the point, I…” Realisation crossed Agatha’s face. “ Oh.”</p><p>Rio moved so she was between Agatha’s legs, looking up at her. A mere mortal in her presence. “I knew in my heart I’d find you, so I didn’t bother chasing women like my friends, even if it was just for sex. It wasn’t a priority, but now I’ve found you, you’re right at the top.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. “Does that mean we’re going to have lots of sex going forward?”</p><p>“I sure hope so.” Rio kissed both of her thighs. “As long as you want to.”</p><p>“Oh, I want,” Agatha assured. “Shall we head inside or…”</p><p>“Or we could stay right here.” Rio kissed her inner thigh again. “It is a very private villa.”</p><p>“No one can see us?”</p><p>“Not a soul.”</p><p>Agatha glanced around cautiously, before looking back down, and Rio could see her eyes gleam with excitement. “What do you have in mind, Miss Vidal?”</p><p>“Well, seeing as I’m already in position…” Her hands slid up her thighs to hook her bikini bottoms. “If that’s okay with you, m’lady?”</p><p>Agatha smirked, raising her hips in response, and Rio didn’t hesitate to pull the offending item down her legs, discarding it in the pool.</p><p>“Rio, really?” Agatha huffed. “Now they’re wet.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. Instead, she finally pressed her face between her thighs, her tongue sliding between her folds. Agatha moaned above her, reacting deliciously to every movement as a hand faced through her wet hair, keeping her firmly in place as her hips pressed towards her.</p><p>“That’s it, baby. Right there.”</p><p>Rio smirked against her before latching her lips onto her clit. It didn’t take long before Agatha’s moans were screams, and at that point she did worry the people on the far bank of the lake would hear her.</p><p>When they were done, when Agatha was catching her breath from what sounded like a very intense orgasm, Rio rested her cheek against her thigh, smiling softly to herself. This was certainly the best way to use a private pool.</p><p>Agatha sat up and looked down at her. “How are you so fucking good at this?”</p><p>“No practise makes perfect?”</p><p>“You’re such a fucking dork.”</p><p>“Takes one to know one.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and nudged Rio away.</p><p>“Hey!” she protested as Agatha stood up.</p><p>“I’ve decided I want to swim,” she announced, before pulling off her bikini top and jumping in the pool, successful splashing Rio in the process.</p><p>Rio wiped the water from her face and saw Agatha swimming across the pool. She looked over her shoulder and granted her a gleaming smile. “You joining me?”</p><p>How could she ever refuse?</p><p> </p><p>After spending most of the afternoon swimming and doing…other things, Rio announced she was calling for take-out, and soon a kid on a moped arrived with two pizzas. They ate outside once more, and they both laughed and chatted as they made their way through the delicious food (all vegetarians of course). It was calm, relaxed, like the rest of the world didn’t matter. Just them in their own little bubble.</p><p>Yet Agatha still had a lot on her mind. She didn’t understand Rio. Well, she did, but there was a part of her that couldn’t relate. Sure, she herself had never prioritized romance, having often stated it was fine for poets but she was an academic. Still, she’d had sex.</p><p>Lots of sex.</p><p>While at Oxford, she’d had sex with a girl from every college, and had spent summers bouncing around staying with her English friends when they headed home and slept her way around whatever city, town, tiny remote village she stayed more than a few nights in. She calmed down when she was older, having flings and short relationships here and there. Before Rio, she hadn’t had sex for over a year, when her work hook-up left on a research sabbatical. None of it had ever meant anything beyond a shared attraction and at a push being able to enjoy their company. Sex aside, her romantic life was pretty boring.</p><p>Still, Rio had laid her very short romantic life out with ease, and Agatha worried if she did the same in return, she would be horrified by the antics of her youth.</p><p>As she sipped from her second glass of wine, listening to Rio finish off a story about the time she had to fill in for Alice’s drummer during her world tour because he’d been denied entry into Australia, she decided to push the thoughts away. This wasn’t serious. It wasn’t a relationship. She didn’t have to give just because Rio did…right?</p><p>“I told Alice I’m happy to step in for her next tour, but she said she’d not getting upstaged by a hot drummer.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Think you’ll have all the girls going crazy, Vidal?”</p><p>“I could slick my hair back and show off my arms like I’m in a 90s boyband.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. Admittedly, that did sound pretty hot. Then another thought came to mind. “Do you think she’ll get back with Jen?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but I kind of hope not.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Really?”</p><p>“Not because I don’t like Jen,” Rio insisted. “But if Jen can’t get over Alice having fans, she shouldn’t be dating a rockstar.”</p><p>“There’s a difference between being a fan and actively flirting,” Agatha argued. “Alice should have seen that.”</p><p>“Hey, I didn’t notice the Honey situation until you mentioned it, and I’d been working with her for weeks.”</p><p>Agatha clicked her tongue disapprovingly. She hated hearing that name. “So you’re both oblivious is what you’re saying?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I guess so, but at least you were reasonable about it.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but laugh. No one had ever described her as ‘reasonable’. “I’m just confident she’s no threat.”</p><p>“You are?”</p><p>“Yeah, I mean I still don’t like her.”</p><p>“Of course.”</p><p>“And I want you to fire her at the earliest opportunity.”</p><p>“Which would be totally unethical...”</p><p>“But I trust you,” Agatha admitted. “I trust that you wouldn’t betray me like that, and I trust you won’t humiliate me…well, any more than you did at the charity auction.”</p><p>Rio laughed warmly. “How ever will I make it up to you?”</p><p>Agatha leaned towards her. “I don’t know. Maybe another, say, forty orgasms will do the trick? But there will be added interest.”</p><p>“Well, I better get to work then.” Rio leaned across the table and kissed her. It was a sweet kiss, but Agatha melted into it anyway. It seemed even the softest of Rio’s touches sent her into a frenzy.</p><p>Rio pulled away and stood up. “Come on. I want to give you your surprise.”</p><p>They brought the leftovers inside, thankful they hadn’t bothered with cutlery, and once the villa was locked up, they headed upstairs. They went to Rio’s room, and Agatha’s gaze instantly locked onto the shopping bag from earlier sat neatly in the middle of the bed.</p><p>“There you go,” Rio grinned. “Your surprise.”</p><p>Agatha eyed her suspiciously before walking over to peek in the bag. Her eyes widened at the contents. “You seriously got this ordered by speedboat?”</p><p>“You asked for it,” Rio reminded her. “I only granted your wish.”</p><p>Agatha tipped the contents on the bed. Lube, a dildo and a harness.</p><p>Exactly what she wanted.</p><p>She pulled off her shirt. “Get saddled up, cowboy.”</p><p>Rio grinned and did as she was told, until the strap was assembled and secure around her hips. Agatha practically jumped onto the bed, biting her lip as Rio crawled over her, moaning as her fingers carefully prepared her, only to gasp when she felt the silicone tip brush against her entrance.</p><p>Rio looked at her, her brown eyes even bigger than normal. “I’ve never done this before so tell me if I do it wrong and when I need to stop.”</p><p>“Just get inside me,” Agatha commanded, and like always Rio did exactly as she asked.</p><p>The rhythm was a little awkward at the start, the first sign Agatha had come across of Rio’s inexperience, yet soon her hips were rolling confidently, grinding deep into her. Once again, she was annoyingly good, though Agatha was certainly enjoying the benefit of Rio’s natural talent.</p><p>She came embarrassingly quickly, digging her nails and heels into Rio’s back, but it didn’t stop there. Rio slowed for a few moments as her orgasm subsided before she leaned up a little and started again, hitting a whole new angle until Agatha was seeing stars once more. Even then she didn’t stop, coaxing a third out of her, ensuring the bed beneath them was totally drenched. It was then Agatha tapped out.</p><p>“I can’t take any more.”</p><p>Rio brought her thrusts to a slow stop, pushing back the hair that had fallen in front of her face before reaching down and gently tucking a stand of Agatha’s hair behind her ear. “Was that…was that okay?”</p><p>Agatha smiled sleepily. “It was amazing.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “Really?”</p><p>“Really.”</p><p>Rio brought her face down to her neck, kissing along the skin. “You’re so beautiful like this. I can’t get enough of you. I love you so much.”</p><p>Agatha’s whole body tensed.</p><p>Rio didn’t seem to realise she’d said it, still mumbling praises against her skin, but she’d heard it loud and clear.</p><p>After a few moments, Rio pulled back. “Hey, you okay?”</p><p>Agatha forced a smile. “I’m great,” she lied. “Just great.”</p>

<p>Agatha woke up alone in Rio’s room, wrapped in the crumpled sheets as the sun creeped in through the gaps in the curtains.</p><p>The bed was still warm, which meant Rio couldn’t have been gone long. She wondered what had dragged her away, though it could be a number of things. The woman was busy, and kind of impulsive. If something was on her mind, she had to do something about it. Move heaven and earth if that’s what it took. Having been on the receiving end of Rio’s determination (both metaphorically and physically), she knew there must have been something she needed to do. Probably a work thing, or something around the villa. Maybe even a FaceTime with Victoria, though it would be the middle of the night in New York.</p><p>It was then Agatha’s mind went to the night before, and the anxious butterflies in her stomach suddenly woke.</p><p>Rio had said she loved her. No declaration. Just a casual term of endearment. A fact maybe. Perhaps she didn’t even know she said it. It was just true. After all it was pretty obvious Rio thought the world of her. In fact, it shouldn’t have taken her by surprise at all. But it had, and Agatha couldn’t leave it.</p><p>So, she decided to message Wanda.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>NEED ADVICE ASAP</em>
</p><p>Wanda would likely still be asleep, but she was usually up early with the boys. She’d know what to do or at least give her some not totally terrible advice. She imagined Kingo would tell her to go all in, to just follow the ride and get as many expensive trips and gifts as she could out of it, but she had never wanted any of that. It meant nothing to her. The problem was somewhere along the way, Rio had started to mean something, and that was where the real problem lay.</p><p>She heard footsteps on the landing and the door pushed open to reveal Rio carrying a large tray. “Ah, you’re awake!”</p><p>“I was wondering where you got to.” Agatha sat up as Rio moved towards her. “What do we have here?”</p><p>“Breakfast,” Rio announced as she placed the tray on the bed. She carefully passed Agatha one of the cups of steaming coffee before placing another on the bedside table. “I thought we could do with a little something.”</p><p>It wasn’t a little something. It was a feast of pastries and fruit and pancakes. Agatha didn’t even know where to start, so picked up a croissant. “Breakfast in bed. Aren’t I lucky?”</p><p>Rio smiled as she slid back onto the bed. “I’m luckier. Getting to wake up and make you breakfast is the best thing ever.”</p><p>“Even better than us having sex?”</p><p>A blush covered Rio’s cheeks. “Okay, maybe a close second.”</p><p>Agatha took a bite from her croissant and of course it was amazing. “Did you make these?”</p><p>“No, I went for a walk to the local bakery,” Rio admitted as she started eating the blueberries. “I’ve been up since five. I had a call with Sydney at 6am.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed sharply. “Who’s Sydney?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “The city, sweetheart.”</p><p>“Oh right.” Agatha tried not to blush. “All okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, they want me to head out there before the start of their summer season. They want to expand the aquarium and make it more of a tourist spot, but I don’t want all the visitors causing stress to the fish.”</p><p>“I’m sure they’ll be fine,” Agatha assured. “They’re being looked at already.”</p><p>“By guests, not hordes of sightseers with phone cameras flashing all the time. And there is also the logistics of guests. Who wants to stay in a tourist attraction? Waking up to kids screaming and people queueing. That doesn’t give five-star hospitality.”</p><p>“Okay, you do have a point there,” Agatha admitted. “So you’ve already made up your mind?”</p><p>“I need to see the proposal first. I never make a decision without knowing all the facts, and also with the extra income we could improve and expand the marine life rehabilitation side of things. That could do a lot of good.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “You and your fish. I swear you’d make a good marine biologist, or a conservator. You know a lot about it. Even I was impressed.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Shit.</p><p>“You’ve, erm, mentioned it a few times.”</p><p>She watched Rio think back, her frown deepening. “When was that?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged it off. “Back at Lilia’s, I think.”</p><p>Rio still seemed to be thinking it over, so Agatha quickly changed the subject.</p><p>“So, what’s on the agenda today?”</p><p>“I thought we could get a boat to Como itself. Maybe explore, grab lunch, and go up the funicular to Brunate.”</p><p>“What’s a funicular?”</p><p>“Like a train,” Rio answered. “It’s a lot of fun.”</p><p>Agatha thought for a moment. “So we’re going in a speedboat again.”</p><p>“It won’t take long,” Rio promised. “Maybe half an hour.”</p><p>“Oh, great,” Agatha forced a smile. Rio leaned in and placed a quick kiss to her lips.</p><p>“You’ll love it. I promise.”</p><p>“And if I don’t?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“I’ll make it up for you.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “In that case, maybe I’ll pretend I hate it.”</p><p>Rio laughed and shook her head. “You’re something else, Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>“Oh I hope so, Rio Vidal.”</p><p> </p><p>Como was a beautiful city. </p><p>Rio loved going there as a kid. There were so many streets to explore with impressive buildings and shops and little bakeries. She didn’t visit often; these days the lake was an escape from, well, people, and she barely left the villa. Yet, like with everything, it was a new experience with Agatha. She wanted to show her everything.</p><p>“This place is cute,” Agatha commented as they walked side by side down a street. “Almost worth dying in a boating accident.”</p><p>“Agatha, the other boat was so far away…”</p><p>“Rio, it was right fucking next to us!”</p><p>Rio decided not to argue. “So, if we head down here, I have a surprise.”</p><p>She led them to the Mercato di Como. The rare times she had come to Como city, it was to visit the market. Rio liked to explore each stall, to find hidden gems and chat with the stall owners. She’d brought Agatha there for a particular stall; however, it seemed she had been distracted by something else.</p><p>“Rio, look!” Agatha stood at a second-hand clothes stall, holding up a long navy trench coat. “Oh, I love it.”</p><p>The coat was long and well-fitted, with pattered purple silk on the inside. Not Rio’s style, but it was certainly nice. “Try it on.”</p><p>Despite the heat, Agatha shrugged on the coat and looked down at herself. “Does it look okay?”</p><p>Rio couldn’t help but stare.</p><p>That coat was made for Agatha, no doubt.</p><p>They were definitely bringing it back with them.</p><p>“Look at this.’ Agatha swished it round like some kind of vampire cape, sound effects and all. It broke Rio out of her trance, making her laugh. </p><p>“It would make for quite the dramatic exit. How much is it?”</p><p>Agatha took the coat of and checked the label. “There’s no tag.”</p><p>Rio looked to the seller. “Quanto costa?”</p><p>“Cinquanta euro,” the seller answered, and Rio quickly pulled the cash out of her wallet. </p><p>“Rio…” Agatha protested, but the coat was already bagged up and handed over. </p><p>“Trust me, this purchase is a selfish one,” Rio insisted. “It looks way too good on you.”</p><p>“Fine, but then I get to buy you something.” Agatha went looking around the stall before grinning mischievously. “Ah ha!”</p><p>Rio looked over nervously and saw it was a pair of aviator sunglasses. Sunglasses that were promptly shoved on her face. </p><p>“There we go,’ Agatha said as she handed the woman 5€. “Hot stuff.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes, pushing the glasses up to sit on top of her head. They would come in useful later. </p><p>“Come on. I have something else to show you.” She led Agatha through the stalls until finally she found the one she wanted. “Here it is!”</p><p>Agatha looked around the stall and frowned. “Jewellery making?”</p><p>“They make charm necklaces,” Rio explained, pointing out an example of the selected charms on an oval-link necklace. “I thought this would be a cute thing to do together.”</p><p>“So we just make our own or…”</p><p>“We could, or we could make each other one?”</p><p>Agatha smiled at that. “Let’s see who knows the other best.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Challenge accepted.”</p><p>They decided to pick seven charms each, and Rio quickly got to work. She two purple broach-like charms as she knew that was Agatha’s favourite colour, a little lilac flower, a crescent moon, a sun tarot card as she recalled Lilia saying it meant happiness and harmony, a little vespa to commemorate their time in Rome, and of course a gold heart.</p><p>She had it made and stood back while Agatha had hers prepared and once, they were both done and paid, they stepped away from the stall to exchange. Rio handed hers over first.</p><p>“I tried to be as aesthetically pleasing as possible,” Rio admitted. “I’m more into interior design than fashion though.”</p><p>Agatha examined it with a beaming smile. “I love it. Put it on me.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate in stepping up to fulfil Agatha’s request, and soon the necklace was safe and secure around her neck. Of course, Agatha looked perfect.</p><p>“Now for you.” Agatha held up her own creation, this one covered in shells and marine life. Rio grinned. She loved it so much, and once Agatha returned the favour and put it on for her and pulled out her phone. “We need a selfie with our matching necklaces.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t argue, just got into position beside her and smiled for the camera. Rio took a few and looked back at them with a fond smile.</p><p>“Perfect. Absolutely perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was freaking out. She tried her best not to show it, but she really fucking was.</p><p>After they left the market, Rio suggested they go get some lunch, so brought her to a square and had ordered wine and their light lunches: Rio wanted arancini while Agatha went for a Greek salad. For a while, she was fine. More than fine. She was enjoying her time with Rio has she had the past few days, talking about this and that.</p><p>Then Rio had to go and stare at her phone with blatant adoration. </p><p>“I love this photo so much. I can’t believe we haven’t had a picture together since the gala.”</p><p>“That seems like so long ago now,” Agatha admitted, and Rio nodded in agreement.</p><p>“A lot has changed since then. I’m just happy we’re here. Now. Together.”</p><p>The word echoed in Agatha’s mind. <em>Together. Together. I love you.</em> </p><p>What did Rio think they were? Did she think they were a couple? Girlfriends of the non-platonic variety? </p><p>Even Agatha wasn’t sure what they were. It seemed they were in some kind of foggy area between a hook up and star-crossed lovers, and she wasn’t sure what direction she wanted to go. When they were alone together, everything felt right. Even the oddities felt right. Like who the fuck orders a strap by speedboat? But she had certainly appreciated the gesture (especially when it was inside her).</p><p>She liked their current little bubble of nice trips and good food and fucking at every given opportunity, but bubbles burst. Outside there were their friends, their jobs, <em>Honey</em>, their pasts, commitments, rumours, judgements. Things that would tear them apart one by one. </p><p>Thankfully, Rio’s phone blasted out Taylor Swift and Agatha was brought back to the present.</p><p>Rio grabbed her phone. “Sorry, it’s Billy.”</p><p>“His ringtone is Shake it Off?” Agatha questioned,</p><p>“He chose it,” Rio explained before picking up the call. “Hey Billy, what’s up?”</p><p>While Rio chatted with her far superior assistant, Agatha took the opportunity to check her own phone. Sure enough, Wanda had replied. </p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>What’s happened?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Is everything okay?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>If you don’t reply soon, I’m calling the Polizia!</em>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and typed back a reply.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>I’m fine. More than fine in a way. Rio and I are now kind of a thing. </em>
</p><p>The reply came quickly.</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>OMGGG TELL ME EVERYTHING</em>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she typed a response. </p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Not enough time, Red. We’d been flirting and she took me on her overnight work trip to Rome. Then when we got back to Lilia’s, I got pissed off over her assistant (can’t wait to smack-talk her when I get back- prepare the wine!) so I kissed her, and we started being more physical. Then there was drama with the others, so we went to her own villa on Lake Como for some privacy so now we’ve gone on some cute dates and had lots of amazing sex…only last night she told me she loved me.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p><em>Okay, okay. One thing at a time. She took you to ROME?! Also can’t wait to hear the assistant drama- please provide a photograph reference. So you kissed her? Go you! Nice idea getting your own place. I’m sure you’re making the most of the privacy </em>😉<em> okay so the main thing- she said she loved you? What like just announced it???</em></p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>We’d finished having sex and she just kind of mumbled it into my neck. I’m not even sure she realized she said it. What should I do?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Well you have two options I guess. Option 1: ignore it and hope she didn’t realize, or option 2: talk to her about it and find a way forward. I know you’ll lean towards option 1 but consider option 2. It has its benefits.</em>
</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Like?</em>
</p><p>
<strong>WANDA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>You can tell her how you feel too. Not saying you’re in love with her yet, or if you ever will be, but you do like her in some way otherwise you wouldn’t be there.</em>
</p><p>Agatha considered her friend’s advice. It would be oh so easy to just pretend it hadn’t happened. To play naive and enjoy whatever this was a little longer. It wouldn’t be the fair thing to do, though. On either of them, really. </p><p>Alright. She decided. They’d talk this out.</p><p>Just as she looked up trains to Milan if this went sideways, Rio ended her call and sighed. </p><p>Agatha quickly set her own phone aside. “You okay?”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio avoided her gaze. “I need to make another call after we’ve eaten.”</p><p>Agatha could see there was more to it. Her eyes narrowed. “Who are you calling?”</p><p>Rio sheepishly caught her eye. “I need to call Honey.”</p><p>She fucking knew it. “What for?”</p><p>“She’s submitted an application to move to the New York office.”</p><p>Agatha’s blood boiled. The scheming little…wait. “Why do you have to call her?”</p><p>“Well, she is entitled to make the move if there is a position at the same level, but I need to ask if she’s willing to stay until the Rome hotel is complete. It’s not a nightmare if she can’t. I do have people overseeing it all, but I’d rather she stays. I know she’s been crossing some boundaries, but she’s good at her job.”</p><p>“But if she’s in New York, won’t she be your assistant permanently?”</p><p>“Billy’s my assistant,’ Rio insisted. “She would be a general assistant to the company.”</p><p> “Rio, you are the company.”</p><p>“Yes, but…it’s difficult enough as it is, Agatha. I don’t want her in New York, but HR have said she has technically done nothing wrong, and her work is exceptional. My father wrote the change of office protocol into our company manifesto, and I can’t go against it. It offers too many great opportunities for the entry level employees to travel and gain experience.”</p><p>HR hadn’t seen what Agatha had seen. Honey had her eyes on Rio, and if they weren’t going to do anything, she would step in herself.</p><p>“Call her now and put it on speaker phone.”</p><p>“Agatha, I…”</p><p>“Rio, please.”</p><p>Rio sighed and inked up her phone. “Keep quiet. Seriously, Agatha. No matter what gets said.”</p><p>“I’ll behave, I swear,’ Agatha traced a cross over her heart. “Now, call her.”</p><p>Rio did as she was asked, and soon the phone was laid between them as they listened to the dull ring. It took Honey a while to pick up, put soon her sickly-sweet voice chimed through.</p><p>
<em>“Rio, hi.”</em>
</p><p>“Hi, Honey. How’s things in Rome?”</p><p>
<em>“Going great! Now all the electric is done, they’re starting to bring the design pieces in. You should see it. It’s already looking amazing.”</em>
</p><p>“That’s great,” Rio said with a genuine smile, and Agatha couldn’t begrudge it. She knew how much she cared about that hotel being everything she dreamed of. “I’m calling actually about you.”</p><p>
<em>“About the move?”</em>
</p><p>“Yes,” Rio confirmed. “And you are well within your rights to do that, however I just want to know whether you’d be willing to stay in Rome a little longer should you get the position? Just so we can hand over all the relevant stuff.”</p><p>
<em>“Of course, but I would like to be back in the states sooner rather than later.”</em>
</p><p>“What kind of time scale are you thinking?”</p><p>
<em>“By the end of summer.”</em>
</p><p>“Right.” Rio seemed deep in thought. “Leave it with me and I’ll be in touch.”</p><p><em>“But aren’t you coming back soon?”</em> Honey quickly questioned. <em>“Or have you already headed back?”</em></p><p>“We’re still in Italy, but we’ll be heading home soon.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but smile. Rio wasn’t hiding that they were together. A thing. A package deal. </p><p>“<em>But I’ll see you before you do?”</em> Agatha could hear the hope in Honey’s voice and quickly bit her tongue.</p><p>“I imagine so.”</p><p>
<em>“That’s great! I’m so excited for you to see the place!”</em>
</p><p>“Neither can I. I will be in touch about both matters.”</p><p>
<em>“I’ll be awaiting your instruction, boss.”</em>
</p><p>Rio reached over to end the call. “There, all done.”</p><p>“All done.” Agatha echoed, mentally shelving her planned conversation for later. Now wasn’t the time.</p><p> </p><p>Rio tried to direct them towards the funicular from memory, but she spent more time looking at Agatha than concentrating where they were going, and so they were lost.</p><p>“I swear I saw a signpost over there,” Agatha suggested. “Or we could get a taxi or bus?”</p><p>“No, I swear it’s not that far.” Rio thought for a moment before relenting. “Let me have a look on Google ma-”</p><p>“Is that a bookstore?!” Agatha grasped her hand and dragged her down the street towards what was, indeed, a bookstore. Soon enough they were through the door, and Rio quickly found herself being led around the maze of shelves and display tales, all filled with books in both Italian and English.</p><p>“We can have a look for books to improve that library of yours,” Agatha declared. “I’m determined to get you reading some good literature.”</p><p>“Hey, Dune is a classic,” Rio argued, which earned her a look of such disgust that she had to hold back a laugh. “It is!”</p><p>“Oh yes, let’s put the work of Shakespeare next to the fucking sandworms”</p><p>“But I’d rather read about the sandworms,” Rio countered, unable to stop herself from smiling. Both at how adorable Agatha was when she was passionate and the fact they were still holding hands. </p><p>“We will get you through this,” Agatha promised. “Now, let me find you the first Agatha Harkness book of the month.”</p><p>With that, Agatha let go of her hand and rushed around the shop like a child in a magical toy emporium. As she was looking, Rio asked one of the staff members for directions and by the time her lady was all done, she knew exactly how to get to the funicular. </p><p>“Well?” Rio eyed the book wearily after Agatha paid for it (after much insistence). </p><p>Agatha handed it over. “There you go.”</p><p>Rio looked at the cover and frowned. “The Great Gatsby?”</p><p>“I thought it was appropriate,” Agatha said with a smirk. “Have you read it?”</p><p>“No, I tried to watch the film on a plane, but I fell asleep.”</p><p>“Then you can read it with fresh eyes.”</p><p>Rio put the book in the bag with the coat as they left the store. They didn’t hold hands on the way to the funicular, but they did occasionally brush as they walked. That was enough to make Rio smile. </p><p>When they got there, the queue was luckily not too bad, and they managed to sit together in one of the front rows of seats of the carriage.</p><p>“Where is this actually taking us?” Agatha asked, as the carriage began to ascend the steep incline. </p><p>“A little town higher up,” Rio answered. “It’ll be worth it, I promise.”</p><p>Then, as the funicular reached above the treeline, the reason for their trip came into view. Agatha gasped.</p><p>“You can see the entire city from up here!”</p><p>“It gets better,” Rio promised. “Just wait until we’re at the top!”</p><p>As soon as they reached the top station at Brunate, she took Agatha to her favourite viewpoints. Views that spanned for miles to all the towns and villages that surrounded the most southern part of the lake. </p><p>“Do you think we can see the villa from here?” Agatha asked and Rio pointed in a north-westerly direction. </p><p>“It’s somewhere that way, but the river curves so we can’t see it. Maybe tomorrow we can go to the opposite bank. See if we can spot it.”</p><p>Agatha smiled tightly, before reaching out and taking her hand.</p><p>“Rio, we need to talk.”</p><p>Her heart dropped. That was never good.</p><p>“What’s wrong? Is everything okay? If you don’t like this, we can head back to the villa and…”</p><p>“Okay, breathe,” Agatha instructed, squeezing her hand. “I’m fine. We just need to talk about something, okay?”</p><p>Rio nodded, though she was far from okay. This sounded serious, and serious usually meant bad. </p><p>She noticed Agatha suck in a deep breath and braced herself for impact.</p><p>“Last night you said you loved me.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “What?”</p><p>“When we’d used the strap and you were kissing my neck, you were mumbling stuff and you said you love me.”</p><p>Oh fuck. “I did?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I figured you didn’t realize.”</p><p>Rio bowed her head. “No, I didn’t.”</p><p>She couldn’t believe this. Things had been going so well. Why did she have to open her stupid mouth and ruin it all? She was such a fucking loser.</p><p>“Well, do you?”</p><p>Rio looked up. “Do I what?”</p><p>“Love me.”</p><p>Rio laughed sadly. “I think you already know the answer to that.”</p><p>Sure enough, Agatha nodded. “I guess I should have known. I just…Rio, this has all been a lot. You suddenly appear in my life and thrown into this whirlwind that I tried to get out of, but I can’t.”</p><p>“Agatha, I would never force you…”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha quickly assured. “You just came on too strong. Not necessarily in a bad way but it’s a lot. The money and the lifestyle is too. It’s nothing new to me. I grew up in the same kind of circles as you but I…I hated being a part of that. Sure, this trip has been amazing, but being in that world was the worst time of my life and I don’t want that again. I have my own life now, and I can’t have that and be part of…this.”</p><p>Rio understood. Agatha was telling her without being blunt, or harsh, that she didn’t want this.</p><p>“Alright.” Rio checked our watch. “We best head back. I made us lasagne.”</p><p>“Rio…” Agatha squeezed her hand, but Rio pulled it away.</p><p>“It’s fine, Agatha,” Rio insisted. “I understand and it’s fine.”</p><p>It wasn’t fine. Not even close. Rio hated herself. Hated that she had made Agatha feel like this. Even more than she hated the fact she finally found the love of her life and lost her through her own ridiculousness.</p><p>She led them back towards the funicular station, walking ahead so Agatha couldn’t see her tears. If this was the last time she would spend in the company of her soulmate, she wasn’t wasting it crying.</p><p> </p><p>Rio hadn’t spoken much on the way back to the villa and had quickly excused herself to start preparing dinner. Agatha headed upstairs, to the room Rio had given her when they arrived. A room she had only entered to retrieve changes of clothes and toiletries. The bed was still made, a vast contrast from the crumpled sheets of Rio’s bed, where they had spent hours wrapped up wearing nothing but shimmering sweat and reddened cheeks.</p><p>Agatha put her phone on charge and began to scroll through her social media, only half registering what she saw.</p><p>She’d fucked up. For someone paid to analyse and put form persuasive points of view, she had been unable to articulate herself properly. Or maybe she had in the moment, only to resent the words the moment they left her mouth.</p><p>She liked Rio. She wanted to see where this went with Rio, but in her mind, she knew where it would go. Rio would come to New York for a while, then she’d have to leave for work, and she’d have to stay for the same reason. They’d try long distance, but in the end, it would just fizzle out. After all, how can you possibly keep up with a woman like Rio Vidal without giving into her world of status and riches, and that would only lead to disaster.</p><p>She could imagine it now. Her finished a lecture and rushing home to attend a gala with her. She’d be happy on Rio’s arm, but soon the looks would start. The snickers. Eleanor Bishop and her little gang spreading rumours behind her back. She’d be a scandal, a jezebel, a pariah. Then she’d say something back, because she could never bite her tongue, and she’d embarrass Rio, who would insist she wouldn’t care, but it wasn’t the point. The point was…</p><p>…</p><p>…</p><p>…the point was she wanted Rio, even though it was selfish to do so.</p><p>In the end, she decided to call Wanda.</p><p><em>“Well?”</em> her friend asked without pleasantries. <em>“How did it go?”</em></p><p>“Terrible,” Agatha admitted. “I didn’t explain myself very well, and now Rio can barely look at me.”</p><p>
<em>“Is she giving you a hard time?”</em>
</p><p>“No, she seems to think she’s done something wrong which, I mean, she didn’t. Not really. Sure, it wasn’t exactly normal way of forming a relationship, but she isn’t just some normal boring person. Even without the money, she’s a total loser in the most complimentary way.”</p><p>
<em>“So what’s happening now?”</em>
</p><p>“I don’t know. I don’t know if I’m leaving in the morning, or if we’re just friends now or what. And I…I don’t even know what I want.”</p><p>She heard Wanda sigh. <em>“Agatha, you flew half-way across the world for her. Deep down, you know exactly what you want, but you’re scared to admit it.”</em></p><p>“Look at you, little miss psychologist.”</p><p><em>“Be serious,</em>” Wanda insisted. <em>“Do you like Rio?”</em></p><p>“I do,” Agatha admitted. “It’s…it’s a surprise, but I do.”</p><p>
<em>“And taking away all the complications, do you want to be with her?”</em>
</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, a part of her not yet ready to admit that. But she had to. She had to be a fucking grown up and face her fears. “I do.”</p><p>
<em>“Well then there you go. Just go for what you fucking want. Lord knows, I wish I had.”</em>
</p><p>“Vision still on the couch then?”</p><p>
<em>“Yes, but we can talk about that another time. My advice is just go for it, Agatha. Go all in, if that’s what you want.” </em>
</p><p>All in. Agatha considered it carefully. “Thanks, Red. I’ll speak to you soon.”</p><p><em>“I hope so,”</em> Wanda replied. <em>“Your love life is the most interesting thing happening in my whole life right now.”</em></p><p>“You need to get laid, Maximoff.”</p><p>
<em>“Just because not all of us are lucky enough to meet a millionaire and stay in their sexy villa.”</em>
</p><p>“Okay bye, you heathen.”</p><p>
<em>“Takes one to know one.”</em>
</p><p>Agatha ended the call and flopped down on her bed.</p><p>All in it was.</p><p>Dinner was quiet. Agatha made conversation, and Rio did her best to continue it, yet the weight of what happened up at Brunate kept pushing them back into silence. Luckily Rio’s lasagne was a good competitor to Lilia’s legendary one, and so Agatha savoured the taste as she bided her time, or rather gathered her courage, for whatever it was she was going to say to fix this, if words could even pull them back out of this.</p><p>When they were done, Rio made an excuse about needing to wash up and left Agatha alone in the gardens. The sun had pretty much set when she reached the iron railing at the edge of the lake, lights beginning to spread across the banks like a reflection of the stars. The automated lights surrounding the villa switched on, illuminating enough to see, yet with a muted warmth that also allowed her to enjoy the dark.</p><p>“There you are.” Rio walked up behind her carrying two glasses of wine. “Sorry, I didn’t want the cheese to harden. It’s already hard to clean off as is.”</p><p>Agatha accepted her glass of wine, along with the excuse. “Thanks.”</p><p>“You’re welcome.”</p><p>They stood side by side, looking out at the now dark water while sipping their wine. A red vintage. Only the best.</p><p>Agatha took a large gulp for luck. “Rio, can we talk?”</p><p>“Can I talk first?” Rio asked quickly, and Agatha suspected she had been waiting for her to initiate. Letting her take the step towards the topic again, while desperate to say her piece.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Go ahead.”</p><p>“I just want to say I’m sorry,” Rio said, her big brown eyes glimmering with the artificial lights. “I was just so excited to finally find you that I kept forgetting that you don’t feel the same way I do, and that’s fine, Agatha. That’ll always be fine. Maybe I should have dated more. Been more, I don’t know, normal.”</p><p>“Hey!” Agatha frowned deeply. “You’re fine exactly the way you are, and I already can’t stand your flirty assistant, your skiing friend, and that random party girl you can’t remember. I can’t deal with a whole load of actual exes.”</p><p>That managed to make Rio laugh. “You know what I mean.”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha assured. “And thanks for understanding.”</p><p>Rio nodded awkwardly. “So are we good?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “We’re good Rio.”</p><p>Rio grinned radiantly. “Good. I’m glad, and from now on, you’re in charge. Whatever I am to you, you decide.”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“No, I mean it, Agatha. Whatever you want, I’ll be that for you. Friend, hook up, whatever. It’s your call and if it means staying in your life, I’ll happily take it.”</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio. She didn’t like those two options. Rio wasn’t a friend, and she wasn’t a hook up. Whatever the fuck she was, it was more than that.</p><p>Her mind travelled to New York, to her life, to the ridiculous high society social circle, to their friends, to Honey’s besotted smile, to Rome, to the Trevi Fountain, to her wish….</p><p>Her wish.</p><p>
<em>Please make me brave. </em>
</p><p>And in that moment, when it counted most, it finally came true.</p><p>“Ask me.”</p><p>Rio blinked in surprise. “What?”</p><p>“Ask me,” Agatah repeated, and watched Rio’s eyes widen in realisation.</p><p>“Wait, you mean…”</p><p>“Yes, Rio. Ask me.”</p><p>Rio looked around, before edging towards the house. “I need…”</p><p>“You don’t need anything,” Agatha insisted. “You told me to tell you when, so that is what I’m doing. Ask me, Rio. Please.”</p><p>Rio looked totally bewildered, looking around once again before quickly dropping down onto one knee. Agatha braced herself, waiting for her to say the words.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Rio began, her big brown eyes starting up at her. “Will you marry me?”</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath. Her wish still had a little juice left, and with that she took the final leap.</p><p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Rio stared up at Agatha, not quite understanding what was happening.</p><p>That afternoon, she’d thought it was all over. That she’d have to fight just to be even a tiny part of her life. And she would have. She’d have done anything, been anything, perhaps in the hope that someday her love would change her mind.</p><p>So when Agatha told her to ask the question, she’d been confused. Then when she understood what she meant, she was even more confused. But she did it anyway, even without the ring at Agatha’s unknowing insistence.</p><p>She had asked Agatha Harkness to marry her, and she’d said yes.</p><p>Now, Rio had no clue what to do with herself.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her expectantly. “Well?”</p><p>Rio blinked out of her haze. “What?”</p><p>Smiling softly, Agatha held her hands out to her. “Get up here and kiss me, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio jumped to her feet and kissed her deeply. Without hesitation. Without second guessing.</p><p>When she pulled away, she pressed their foreheads together. “Do you mean it?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Truely?”</p><p>“Yes, Rio. I mean it. Now kiss me again.”</p><p>Rio quickly complied, each beat of her heart a jump for joy. This had to be a dream. How could this just…happen?</p><p>As soon as they broke apart, Rio grinned. “We’re engaged! Like <em>really</em> engaged!”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Yes, we are.”</p><p>“This is amazing!” Rio squeezed both her hands before letting one go, using the other to lead her <em>fiancée </em>towards the main house. “We need to celebrate!”</p><p>Soon enough, Rio was rummaging around the kitchen while Agatha picked at the batch of brownies she had stress-baked earlier.</p><p>“How are you so fucking good at everything?”</p><p>“I’m not good at everything,” Rio answered from the depths of the wine cupboard. “I told you, I learnt to cook as a kid.”</p><p>“There’s being able to cook then there’s making everything taste like I’m at a Michelin-Star restaurant with reasonable portion sizes.”</p><p>“I was taught by Michelin-Star chefs,” Rio reminded her. “And I practise a lot. I don’t eat out often.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “I could make so many jokes right now, but I don’t want to ruin the moment.”</p><p>“Ah ha!” Rio finally found the bottle she was looking for. “Here it is.”</p><p>“What is it?”</p><p>Rio pulled out the bottle and held it up for to see. “Dom Perignon. I’m not usually a champagne lover, but Carol gifted me it after I let her and Maria stay here last year. I guess now is a good time to open it up. Come on.”</p><p>Rio led them up to the study and retrieved the wide champagne glasses from the cabinat. “My mother always said that champagne was not for flutes.”</p><p>“Lilia says that same,” Agatha added as she perched on the arm of the couch. “I remember she used to complain when my mother used to put it in flutes.”</p><p>Rio set the glasses on the drink cart and worked on opening the bottle. “Did your mother and Lilia get on?”</p><p>“Not particularly. Mother thought making Lilia my godmother would create a good social connection, but they never became close. If anything, my mother just used Lilia to get rid of me from time to time.”</p><p>“Your mother sounds…intense.”</p><p>“She was…she was horrible, very strict and conservative,” Agatha admitted. “And this, us, would have made her explode, even with you having all that money.”</p><p>Rio managed to pop the champagne, and after giving it a moment to breathe, began to pour it into the two glasses. “Well, your mother was a fool, and I am forever lucky to have you in my life.”</p><p>She heard her fiancée chuckle. “Ever the charmer.”</p><p>“You best get used to it,” Rio warned her teasingly. “I plan to praise, compliment, and generally hype you up for the rest of our lives.”</p><p>“Oh no!” Agatha gasped. “How awful!”</p><p>Rio smiled as she picked up the two glasses and finally turned to face her future wife. It amazed her that every time she looked at Agatha, she was the most beautiful sight she’d ever seen. That moment was no exception. As she perched on the arm of the couch, only standing to accept the glass.</p><p>Rio held up a glass. “I would make a speech, but I’ve never been very good at those. So I guess I’ll just say that I’ve never been as happy as I am right now.”</p><p>Agatha grinned and held her own glass up. “I’m pretty happy right now too.”</p><p>“To us,” Rio toasted, and marvelled at her fiancée’s bright smile.</p><p>“To us,” Agatha repeated, bringing their glasses together before sealing the toast with a delicate kiss. “And look, no fancy set up. Just you and me, in your family home. Absolutely perfect.”</p><p>It was then, however, that Rio remembered something important.</p><p>“I need to get something.” She set her glass back down on the cart. “Wait right here.”</p><p>“Can’t it wait?” Agatah questioned, and Rio shook her head.</p><p>“Trust me, okay?” Rio headed towards the door. “I’ll be two minutes.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Fine, so what you must, but remember, your fiancée is waiting.”</p><p>Rio grinned. Hearing it out loud felt so good.</p><p>She gave Agatha a finger salute before rushing off in the direction of her room, in pursuit of the treasure she had kept hidden for too long.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha waited for Rio, her eyes once more travelling over the frames that covered the walls and surfaces. Of Rio’s family. A family she had just agreed to join, and one she would never meet.</p><p>The same could be said for her, she knew, but that was different. Even if her mother were alive, she wouldn’t want Rio anywhere near her. The only loss she had were the years her mother was living. Even the months spent in that fucking boarding school found her freedom, and she hated that place.</p><p>Yet somehow all those dark times, all that loneliness and despair, led her to that exact moment. Engaged to a rich loser who adored her, and she…she liked her quite a bit too. A lot, she guessed.</p><p>It was all pretty crazy, but also amazing.</p><p>She heard rushed footsteps and soon enough, Rio came barrelling into the room, holding something behind her back.</p><p>“Sorry about that.”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Agatha smirked and stepped towards her. “I just hope whatever this is was worth leaving you fiancée all alone for.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, her eyes dark. “It’s worth it. Just don’t get mad, okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “Get mad about what?”</p><p>“Okay, so I’ve had this a while, and I know I promised not to get one, but I saw it, and it was perfect.” Rio brought out her hand from behind her back, revealing a small velvet box.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened.</p><p>This was it. This was the ring.</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“I promise, it’s not much. I just saw it and knew it was the one.” With that, Rio dropped to one knee again and opened the box.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>The ring was…the ring was perfect.</p><p>Elegant, tasteful, with a single lilac stone that glistened even in the low lighting of the study. Totally not what Agatha expected, but more than she could have imagined.</p><p>“Agatha, will you marry me?”</p><p>“I’ve already said yes,” Agatha reminded her.</p><p>“But I didn’t do it properly that time.” Rio lifted the ring box a little higher. “So?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Yes, Rio. I want to marry you. Now will you please put the ring on so we can drink our champagne and go christen this engagement.”</p><p>Rio grinned as she carefully slid the ring onto her finger. “It looks amazing.”</p><p>Agatha flexed her finger, testing the new weight. She wanted to admire it properly, but study every tiny detail, but she had other things on her mind. She grabbed the champagne bottle and headed for the door.</p><p>“Come on, Vidal. Let’s move this party somewhere more comfortable.”</p><p>When they woke up the next morning, they were naked in bed with an empty bottle of expensive champagne on the bedside table. Agatha rested her head on Rio’s shoulder, admiring the ring as her hand rested below her lover’s collarbone.</p><p>“I thought it was a dream,” Rio said, before kissing the top of Agatha’s head.</p><p>“Not a dream,” Agatha assured. “Last night was very much real. But right now, I want to know the ring story.”</p><p>“The ring story?”</p><p>“You know, about how you found the ring.” Agatha stared at it curiously. “And how did you get the perfect size?”</p><p>“It was a total coincidence,” Rio insisted. “I was wondering through Rome and it caught my eye in a jeweller’s window. It’s vintage, made in the 1940s and bought in Austria. The guy in the store said it’s 14ct white gold and the sapphire is 7ct. I had it authenticated and all is correct.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. Of course she had it authenticated. “So what? You just saw it and that was that.”</p><p>“Pretty much,” Rio admitted. “As for the size, well, I planned for us to sort that out after a proposal. It seems like it was just meant to be.”</p><p>“Definitely meant to be.” Agatha placed a kiss to her chest. “We never took any photos last night. Maybe we can today?”</p><p>“You want photos?” Rio questioned, and Agatha nodded.</p><p>“No one is going to believe me without evidence.”</p><p>“This.” Rio tapped the violet stone. “Isn’t proof enough?”</p><p>“For my friend, Wanda? No. She’ll think I’m playing around.”</p><p>“Then we better make the photos convincing.”  Rio shifted out from underneath her. “I’ll go make us some coffee, then breakfast?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “As long as we don’t have to leave the villa today. I want <em>you</em> all to myself.”</p><p>Rio raised her eyebrows. “Oh really?”</p><p>Agatha kissed her before pulling back with a mischievous grin. “Hurry back, my love.”</p><p>Rio scrambled for some shorts and a shirt, before scampering off out of the bedroom. Agatha laughed to herself and flopped back against the pillows.</p><p>She lifted her hand, marvelling at how it glistened in the morning sun. She had to admit, Rio hadn’t exaggerated. It was the perfect ring.</p><p>Sitting up, she swung her legs over the edge of the bed and reached for her phone. Opening her camera app, she snapped a few shots of her ring. Not the usual glamorous ring close-ups she saw in most engagement announcements, but it would do.</p><p>When Rio came back with their coffees, she showed her the photo. “Can I send this to Lilia?”</p><p>“You don’t have to ask,” Rio said as she lay out on top of the sheets. “Tell whoever you want, my love.”</p><p>“So you don’t want to wait or anything?”</p><p>“Not unless you want to?”</p><p>Agatha smiled and shook her head.</p><p>“Then tell the entire world,” Rio assured. “I’m restraining myself from climbing on the roof and shouting it across the entire lake.”</p><p>Agatha opened her chat with Lilia and typed out the message.</p><p>
<strong>AGATHA</strong>
</p><p>
<em>So Rio and I have some news…</em>
</p><p>She attached the photo and pressed send.</p><p>“Well.” She threw the phone towards the end of the bed. “That’s done.”</p><p>“What about the rest of your friends?”</p><p>“I can tell them later.” Agatha climbed into Rio’s lap. “For now…I have something else on my mind.”</p><p>“Sweetheart,” a smile played on Rio’s lips, “our coffees will get cold.”</p><p>Agatha leaned down until their mouths were millimetres apart, grinning when she felt Rio’s breath hitch against her lips. “Then we’ll have to be quick.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio was on cloud nine.</p><p>She was engaged to Agatha.</p><p>She was marrying the love of her life.</p><p>And currently, after their early rise ended up with them not getting out of bed until almost noon, they were sat eating what were supposed to be breakfast pancakes for lunch. She never imagined life could ever be so good.</p><p>“Lilia hasn’t responded to my message,” Agatha huffed. “She’s ignoring it!”</p><p>“Don’t think too much into it,” Rio tried to reassure her. “She might not have even seen it.”</p><p>“She’s still got her read receipt on her iMessages.”</p><p>“Right.” Rio took a sip of her orange juice. “It might just be a bit of a shock. It has been a whirlwind romance.”</p><p>“She told me to give you a chance,” Agatha argued. “I did, and here we are. She encouraged this!”</p><p>“It’ll be fine,” Rio promised. “If I have to, I’ll create a persuasive speech with accompanying PowerPoint presentation.”</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Agatha tilted her head. “What would it say?”</p><p>“Why I want to marry you, and what I can offer you.”</p><p>“Offer me?” Agatha’s foot brushed her ankle. “Like what?”</p><p>“Financial stability.”</p><p>“That’s pretty obvious.”</p><p>“Fun adventures.”</p><p>“Again, that’s to be expected.”</p><p>“Stability.”</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>“Unwavering devotion.”</p><p>“That’s more like it.”</p><p>“My heart.”</p><p>“I’d like that very much.”</p><p>“My body.”</p><p>“Now we’re talking.”</p><p>“My desire.”</p><p>“How about we work on that right now?”</p><p>“Agatha, we’re outside! We can’t!”</p><p>“Are you sure?” Agatha’s foot trailed up her leg before pressing between her thighs. “It’s not like we didn’t do it in the pool.”</p><p>Rio bit her lip as Agatha’s foot pressed in all the right places. “I swear, you’re some kind of succubus.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Does that mean it’s working?”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, her phone chimed on the table. She quickly sat up. “It’s the Ring Doorbell.”</p><p>“For where?”</p><p>“For here.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her foot away. “Who is it?”</p><p>Rio moved the phone so she could see before pressing the notification. As soon as Agatha saw their faces, she groaned.</p><p>“You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p><p>Rio stared in disbelief at the sight. There, stood at the front gates, were Lilia and Jen, the former’s face taking up most of the camera lens.</p><p>
<em>“You two better open this gate right now!”</em>
</p><p>“How the fuck did they find out where you live?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“I lent them my drivers,” Rio reminded her. “They probably brought them.”</p><p>“Can we just pretend we’re not here?” Agatha suggested. “Let’s say we’re in Rome or something.”</p><p>“We can’t lie.”</p><p>“Sure we can,” Agatha encouraged, but Rio shook her head.</p><p>“Let’s just face the music.”</p><p>Agatha sighed and got to her feet. “Most of the time, I love how honest you are. Times like this, not so much.”</p><p>Rio opened the gate on her phone, and by the time she and Agatha made it to the front of the villa, Lilia was already dragging her suitcase up the path, Jen struggling to catch up with her own luggage.</p><p>“Lilia?” Agatha stepped forward to meet her. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“I’ve come to work out what the hell is going on. You two. Inside. Now.”</p><p>Lilia dragged her case into the house, Agatha following quick behind. Rio watched them go, before moving to help Jen get her case up the steps.</p><p>“How worried should I be?”</p><p>Jen laughed. “I so don’t envy you right now.”</p><p>Rio quickly excused herself to go get the new arrivals something to drink and returned with a jug of iced lemonade and a bowl of chips.</p><p>Agatha had settled Lilia at the table on the patio, while Jen had taken the seat with the most direct sunlight. They sat in silence, and all watched Rio closely as she nervously poured them all a drink, before sitting in the chair next to her fiancée.</p><p>Lilia took a sip of her drink before placing it down on the table. Her gaze then locked onto her and Agatha, and Rio had never been so scared of a stare in her life.</p><p>“What the hell are you two thinking?”</p><p>“What do you mean?” Agatha frowned, and Lilia’s stare shifted into a glare.</p><p>“You know exactly what I mean. You’ve engaged!”</p><p>“Yes, Lilia. Hence the fancy new ring on my finger.”</p><p>“Stop it, Agatha. This is serious! Why would either of you think this was a good idea?”</p><p>“What?” Agatha questioned, this in a tone so false Rio had to bite her lip not to laugh. “Aren’t you happy for us?”</p><p>“I’d be happy for you if you hadn’t rushed into this,” Lilia insisted. “How could you both be so ridiculous?!”</p><p>“We’re not ridiculous,” Agatha insisted. “This is what we both want.”</p><p>Lilia shook her head in disbelief, before her eyes locked on Rio. “Well? What do you have to say for yourself?”</p><p>Rio took a gulp from her drink before answering. “I-I love your goddaughter. I want to spend the rest of my life with her.”</p><p>“Yes, I know that,” Lilia dismissed. “But why now? Why after you can’t have been together more than three days?”</p><p>“They’ve been together longer than that,” Jen pointed out. “They’d started something in Sicily.”</p><p>“Yes, but nothing official,” Lilia argued. “So, how long have you actually been together? Officially?”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha, who shrugged. “Technically, we’ve been dating for months.”</p><p>“Please be serious here,” Lilia demanded. “This isn’t a joke.”</p><p>“We know,” Rio insisted. “Look, Lilia, in my head I’ve been Agatha’s since the moment I saw her. With all due respect, if she wants to marry me, I’m not going to say no.”</p><p>“Wait, Agatha proposed?” Jen questioned.</p><p>“I proposed that she propose to me,” Agatha corrected.</p><p>Lilia put her head in her hands. “This is worse than I thought.”</p><p>“You’re being dramatic,” Agatha accused. “You should be fucking happy for me, not questioning everything!”</p><p>“I’m questioning because I don’t want you both to make a huge mistake!”</p><p>“I don’t have to listen to this!” Agatha jumped to her feet and began to storm off towards the lake. Lilia got up and stormed after her, and Rio moved to do the same, but Jen quickly stopped her.</p><p>“Let them hash it out,” Jen advised. “You don’t want to get in the middle of that.”</p><p>Rio sat back down, watching the chase from a distance.</p><p>“Have you spoken to Alice?” Jen asked, and Rio shook her head.</p><p>“I’ve been, erm, too busy. Have you?”</p><p>“Me?” Jen questioned. “No way am I talking to her!”</p><p>“Right.”</p><p>“But when you tell her about the engagement, you could, you know, ask how she is.”</p><p>“Sure.”</p><p>“You know, ask what she’s up to...”</p><p>“Okay…”</p><p>“Who she’s seeing…”</p><p>“Jen, just talk to her.”</p><p>“No, no, absolutely not!”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes and looked back towards her fiancée, and saw that Agatha had nearly reached the lake, Lilia close behind.</p><p>“Will Agatha still marry me without Lilia’s approval?”</p><p>“Fuck should I know,” Jen replied. “So, when you talk to Alice, make sure she knows that I’m great. Because I am. Absolutely fantastic, because…Hey! Rio, stop!”</p><p>But Rio was already out of her chair. “I can’t! I need to prove to Lilia that I’m good enough!”</p><p>“It’s nothing to do with you,” Jen grabbed the back of her shirt and pulled her back. “Just let them have their spat, okay?”</p><p>Rio dropped back into her chair and reluctantly watched the scene from afar.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha was furious.</p><p>How <em>fucking </em>DARE Lilia show up like this and make accusations? Who the fuck did she think she was?!</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” Lilia snapped from behind her. “You stop and talk to me right now!”</p><p>“I’m not a kid, Lilia,” Agatha huffed. “And you’re not my mother!”</p><p>“No, but I might as well be so stop right now and talk to me!”</p><p>That did slow Agatha down a little, but she didn’t stop until she reached the railing looking out onto the lake. Lilia moved to stand beside her and placed a gentle hand on her arm.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to come in all gun’s blazing, but I worry about you. I don’t want you to make a mistake.”</p><p>“Do you think Rio’s a mistake?” Agatha questioned. “You were encouraging it not long ago.”</p><p>“Of course I don’t think Rio is a mistake. Out of all the women I’ve known about, she’s by far the best you’ve chosen. But marriage is a lot, Agatha. It’s a promise. It’s building a life together, maybe even a family. Do you think you can do that?”</p><p>“Do you think I can’t?”</p><p>“I think…I don’t know, Agatha. I just hope you’re making the right decision.”</p><p>“I am,” Agatha insisted. “I-Rio’s good to me, Lilia, and I’ll try my very best to be good for her too.”</p><p>“But is that a promise you truly believe you can keep?”</p><p>“Yes,” she said without hesitation. “I want this, Lilia. I know it all sounds crazy, but this is truly what I want.”</p><p>Lilia stared at her a moment before sighing. “If that is the truth, then fine. I am happy for you. I just wished you two hadn’t skipped an entire phase of dating.”</p><p>Agatha waved her off. “That part is boring anyway.”</p><p>Before Lilia could respond, a familiar voice shouted over.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p>They both looked round to see Rio barrelling towards them, Jen close behind. Agatha barely had time to react before her fiancée threw herself in her arms.</p><p>“Agatha, please don’t leave me!”</p><p>“I’m not going to leave you, you loser. We’re all good now.”</p><p>Rio pulled back and looked to Lilia. “So you’re okay with this? Us?”</p><p>“Oh dear.” This time it was Lilia stealing a hug. “It was never about you. You, Miss Vidal, are all I could have hoped for.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart almost burst in her chest. It seemed she had indeed made the right choice.</p><p>Jen reached them and clapped her hands. “Right, you two. Go get dressed up. We’re taking engagement photos.”</p><p>Soon enough, they were both in dolled up and indulging Jen in taking as many sickly-sweet engagement pictures as possible. The only enjoyable parts of it were her being able to argue with Jen, and spending most of it snuggled next to Rio. Especially when Rio’s otherwise delicate white silk and lace dress was totally open at the sides, and Agatha made any excuse to subtly touch the exposed skin.</p><p>After all, her fiancée was fucking <em>hot</em>.</p><p>Agatha, however, had been forced into one of Jen’s dresses after she came down wearing slacks and made to change (after much protest) into a yellow and black floral dress with stupid puffy sleeves. Though Rio of course said she looked beautiful and kept kissing her cheek at every given opportunity. That part she didn’t mind so much.</p><p>“We need to have an engagement party or something so we can get some better pictures,” Agatha commented between poses. “This dress is atrocious.”</p><p>“I like it,” Rio insisted. “And I think the photos will look cute.”</p><p>“Please. We don’t match, and everyone is going to be distracted by the amount of side-boob you’re showing. In fact, it’s distracting me right now.”</p><p>Rio just grinned. “All part of the plan, baby.”</p><p>“Hey,” Jen huffed. “Less talking, more smiling.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Jen, we’re not your personal models. I think you have enough now.”</p><p>Jen sighed and thankfully averted her phone. “I’ll find the best ones and edit them later. Unless you want to send some now?”</p><p>“I just need one,” Agatha told her. “Evidence for a friend.”</p><p>“Fine, come have a look.”</p><p>The photos didn’t look as bad as the thought, but in the end chose one that showed the least puffy sleave and side-boob. Of her and Rio smiling, their clasped hands held out towards the camera with the ring on full display.</p><p>Agatha smiled and saved it to her phone as they walked back towards the villa.</p><p>“Are you two staying?” Rio asked Jen. “Or is Milan calling you back.?”</p><p>“Please. You’ll have to drag me out of this place. The selfie opportunities are endless! And it looks like Lilia has already made herself at home.”</p><p>In true Lilia fashion, she was sat on the patio with a glass of wine like she owned the place. Agatha shook her head. She couldn’t take her anywhere.</p><p>“Maybe you two could have an engagement party here,” Jen suggested. “Or back at Lilia’s. I mean, we fly back next week, but we could organise it before then. It also gives Alice plenty of notice to leave whatever yacht she’s ended up on.”</p><p>“Jen, just fucking text her,” Agatha huffed. “I’m sure she misses you too.”</p><p>“I don’t miss her,” Jen insisted. “But I think it would be good for Rio if she was around. Currently she’s surrounded by your inner circle.”</p><p>“You are not my ‘inner circle’, Kale, and Rio’s friends live busy lives. We need to give them more notice. Perhaps we could organise something when we get back to New York.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “I’m not too interested in a big party. I know it’s the done thing, but I’m not inviting a load of people I only talk to regarding business and charity work to ‘keep up appearances’.”</p><p>Agatha linked arms with her fiancée and grinned. “See? Rio gets it.”</p><p>“Because you’ve brainwashed her,” Jen accused. “I’m not dropping this. We are having a party and we’re having it soon.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes before hugging Rio’s arm. “Am I okay to tell Wanda?”</p><p>“Agatha, I meant what I said earlier,” Rio insisted. “Tell the whole world if you want.”</p><p>“Not yet,” she said. “I want you all to myself a little bit longer.”</p><p>“Unfortunately, my love, we now have guests.”</p><p>“But they can sleep on the top floor,” Agatha suggested. “And really, it’s their fault for showing up here unannounced. I still have unresolved frustration from when they interrupted us earlier.”</p><p>Rio laughed, a fresh blush gracing her cheeks. “Whatever you want, my love.”</p><p>“You two know I can hear you, right?” Jen said with disgust.</p><p>“You’ll be hearing even more tonight,” Agatha argued, and cackled as her old friend fled with her hands over her ears.</p><p>“That was cruel,” Rio commented, laughing away. “I love your evil side.”</p><p>“You love all my sides.”</p><p>“I do,” Rio admitted. “Every single one.”</p><p>Agatha grinned and pulled out her phone. She opened her chat with Wanda and attached the engagement photo to a simple message.</p><p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>After a memorable week at Rio’s villa, it was almost time to head back stateside. Lilia and Jen were considering going back to Lilia’s villa and staying a few extra days. They’d asked her and Rio to join them, but her fiancée had some last things sign off on the hotel, and like hell Agatha was going anywhere she wasn’t.</p><p>“Well, it’s been fun,” Jen said as Rio’s driver hauled their cases into the back of the black SUV. “Now, are you sure you’re not having a party?”</p><p>“We’re sure, for now,” Agatha confirmed. “I’ll see you back in New York.”</p><p>“You better, because I have always wanted to help plan a wedding and I have better taste than you too.”</p><p>“Oh Jen, leave them alone,” Lilia huffed before giving Agatha a hug. “Come see me when we’re both home.”</p><p>“I will,” Agatha promised, and watched as her godmother moved to give Rio a tight hug also.</p><p>“I look forward to getting to know you better. After all, we are about to be family.”</p><p>Agatha watched the smile grow on Rio’s lips and wanted nothing more than to yank Lilia away and pull her fiancée into her own arms. But she watched on as her godmother pulled back and only moved to take Rio’s hand once their visitors were climbing into the SUV, and they stood back to wave them off as they set off for Milan, and their flight ready to take them back to Sicily.</p><p>Once they were out of sight, Rio led Agatha back to the house to finish they’re packing. “We have to set off in an hour to make our train from Milan.”</p><p>“Why didn’t we go with them then?” Agatha questioned, and Rio smiled sheepishly.</p><p>“I wanted to travel just us. As soon as we get to Rome, it’s back to reality. I just want to stay in our bubble a little longer.”</p><p>Agatha hugged her arm as they entered the house. “Me too, my love. Me too.”</p><p>In theory, it should have been pretty easy to find all her stuff to pack, but having jumped between her room and Rio’s, it seemed her belongings had moved around with her. She had found one shoe in her room and the matching one under Rio’s bed, and she found a pair of her underwear tangled in Rio’s sheets.</p><p>Rio was to no surprised a quick packer and was sat folding whatever clothes Agatha had gathered on the bed ready to pack.</p><p>“Have you got the ring box?” she asked.</p><p>“Yes, but I don’t really need it,” Agatha told her. “I’m not taking it off anytime soon. I may need to get a ring dish for my apartment, though. I can’t wear this doing the dishes.”</p><p>“I’ll buy you one,” Rio said quickly. “What kind would you want?”</p><p>“I’ll sort it. I mean it’s not like I’m going to be staying in my apartment much longer anyway.”</p><p>“Why? We could still live there if you wanted.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “The millionaire that lives in a one-bedroom apartment with a shower that has zero water pressure. Yeah, I can really see that happening.”</p><p>“I’ll be fine as long as you’re there,” Rio insisted, and Agatha almost believed her.</p><p>“I’m not overly attached to the place,” Agatha admitted. “We can sort all that out when we get back.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “And you can meet Victoria!”</p><p>Agatha grimaced. “That I am not looking forward to.”</p><p>“You’ll love her,” Rio promised. “She’s a sweetie.”</p><p>Agatha decided to change the subject. “Have you told Alice yet?”</p><p>“Not yet,” Rio admitted, and Agatha stopped backing to look at her.</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because she’s going to give me a lecture about rushing things. I’ll deal with that later.”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“I just want to be happy right now. We had a close call with Lilia. I don’t want any more drama all because people can’t help inserting their own opinions into our relationship.”</p><p>Agatha got off the floor and climbed onto the bed, kissing Rio softly. “Tell Alice. She was rooting for us. It might be a shock but she’s your best friend. She’ll support you.”</p><p>“I’ll tell her before we head back to New York. I promise.”</p><p>Agatha gave her one more kiss before getting back on the floor. “Come on. We need to get packed.”</p><p>Soon enough, they had closed up the villa and were driving back to Milan. Another of Rio’s drivers arrived and Agatha watched the landscape roll by as her fiancée chatted away in Italian. This was her life now: drivers and extravagance, but not as it had been before. Her mother and the rest of the Harkness family were old, traditional, with gaudy taste. Rio was open-minded, kind, and avoided the over-the-top extravagance of those with a much smaller fortune.</p><p>She wondered about the parts of Rio’s life she hadn’t discovered yet. Her work life when she wasn’t on location, her apartment, her friends other than Alice. She knew she liked basketball and soccer, but she hadn’t experienced watching a sports game together yet. They hadn’t listened to each other’s favourite music, or gone to the movies, or had a chaotic morning before work. Those were the things she was most looking forward to. That and the sex, but she was already <em>very</em> satisfied in that department.</p><p>Though with Jen and Lilia around, Rio had been a little shy about sex and had been desperately trying to keep quiet. Agatha should have guessed. Rio was new with intimacy, or intimacy she could remember anyway, and she figured her friend teasing her about hearing her with that girl probably made her self-conscious. She’d make it her mission to fix that.</p><p>Rio’s driver dropped them off at the Milano Centrale. Agatha had to admit, the station was grand, like something out of an old movie, or like they were spies in an internation espionage epic. Yet, despite how pretty it was, she couldn’t understand why they were there.</p><p>“Why are we getting the train when we could just fly?”</p><p>“Climate change is a real issue…”</p><p>“Rio, that plane is flying whether we’re on it or not, and this isn’t exactly clean travel.”</p><p>“I know, but I thought this would be nice.”</p><p>“You did?”</p><p>Rio nodded and took Agatha’s hand as they dragged their cases towards the platforms. “And don’t worry. I’ve got us the best seats in the house.”</p><p>Her fiancée was of course not exaggerating. Rio had booked them seats in the executive carriage, with comfy leather seats and a special menu designed by a Michelin star chef.</p><p>Rio sat in the seat opposite her, practically buzzing with excitement as she looked out of the window as the train began to pull out of the station. The sight made Agatha smile.</p><p>“You’re really enjoying this, huh?”</p><p>“I love trains,” Rio admitted. “Especially old ones. I have a few I run through a separate company I bought a few years back.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. Of course she did. “Okay, knowing you you’re going to say you own the Orient Express or something…Rio?”</p><p>“It was an investment!”</p><p>They chatted for a while and had some champagne and fancy food, before settling in to do their own thing. Agatha got out her book and divided her time between reading and staring out at the passing through the Tuscan countryside on its way south.</p><p>Rio had brought an iPad and keyboard and seemed to be busy working. After a while, Agatha stole a glance at her fiancée and saw her squinting at her screen. She took off her glasses and held them out to her. “Try these.”</p><p>Rio took them and carefully slid them onto her face. She blinked at the screen and leaned back slightly.</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “You need glasses, babe.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio assured. “It’s just the lighting.”</p><p>“I wear glasses. There’s no shame in it.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio assured. “I just don’t need them.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips, before coming up with plan B. She picked up her book and began to read. “That’s a shame. I find glasses kind of sexy.”</p><p>Rio had an optician’s appointment booked by the time they reached Roma Termini.</p><p>The station was busy, both with travellers and people strolling through the attached shopping mall. Eventually, they made it out onto an equally busy street filled with tourist shops and to-go eateries.</p><p>Agatha put on her sunglasses and looked up and down the street. “Shall we get a cab?”</p><p>“We can walk it,” Rio assured. “It’s not far.”</p><p>Rio’s definition of ‘not far’ was strikingly different from hers. By the time they reached their hotel, Rio was dragging both cases with a grin on her face, while Agatha was a sweaty, breathless mess.</p><p>The young bellhop from their last visit was stood by the doors and walked over to meet them with a bright grin.</p><p>“Rio, you’re back!”</p><p>“Don’t get too excited, Matt,” Rio told him as he took one of the cases from her. “After this stay, I’m checking out!”</p><p>“You are?” He seemed disappointed. “But we never had that rematch?”</p><p>“Sorry, dude. My poker days are behind me. I’m soon to be a married woman.”</p><p>Matt frowned, before Agatha saw his eyes zero in on her ring. His disappointment was quickly replaced by a huge grin. “Ah <em>Congratulazioni!”</em></p><p>“Grazie,” Agatha replied. “We’re very happy.”</p><p>“I can see.” Matt nudged Rio. “You’re a lucky woman, my friend.”</p><p>“Oh, I know.” Rio looked at her with such adoration that Agatha wanted to kiss her senseless right there. An urge that only heightened as they headed up to the penthouse, her fiancée chatting away to Matt about their engagement, while her thoughts turned to more R Rated memories of that night.</p><p>When they entered the room, she loitered back while the pair continued to chat, wishing for once that Rio could stop being nice and polite for once so they could finally be alone again. Something she would have to become more patient with when they settled into life together, but they were still technically on vacation. Patience could wait.</p><p>As soon as Rio closed the door after saying goodbye to Matt, Agatha pounced. She kissed her so fiercely, Rio yelped before kissing her back with equal enthusiasm.</p><p>Eventually though, she pulled back. “Sweetheart, we can’t right now.”</p><p>“Why not?” Agatha whined and tried to steal another kiss, only for Rio to hold her back.</p><p>“Because I need to go to the hotel and sign some papers, and I want to take you out. Show you more of my favourite haunts.”</p><p>Ah yes, the hotel. Their reason for being here. The final touches for preparation before Rio returned home with her.</p><p>Which meant them going to her office at the soon to be hotel.</p><p>Which meant them seeing Honey.</p><p>Agatha wiggled her ring finger, testing the weight once more. “Alright then. Let me go freshen up.”</p><p>She headed for the bathroom, a plan forming in her mind.</p><p>She was about to show the whole world who Rio Vidal’s heart truly belonged to.</p><p> </p><p>Rio loved holding Agatha’s hand. It was her new favourite thing, well besides the kiss and the…other stuff they did in private. Still, holding hands made her feel a warmth that even the hot Italian sun couldn’t accomplish.</p><p>She arrived at what was soon to be the Vidal Roma, and she already noticed an improvement since her last visit. The outward façade had certainly had a clean-up, and the bronze name plate had finally been put into place. It was official. It was a Vidal hotel in the making.</p><p>Agatha whistled as they walked inside, taking into the now ornate lobby, the chaos of plastic sheets and tools replaced by uncovered mosaics and a plush new carpet and art deco furnishings.</p><p>“Holy shit! How have they managed to get this sorted in less than two weeks.”</p><p>“Most of it was already here,” Rio explained. “We just brought it out of hiding.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand. “It’s amazing, Rio. Really.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “And it’ll be even better once it’s all done.”</p><p>“I can’t wait to see it. And maybe stay here?”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’m sure I can make that happen, or you can. Soon what’s mine is yours.”</p><p>“Hardly a fair trade,” Agatha argued, but Rio shook her head.</p><p>“Spending the rest of my life with you is priceless.”</p><p>Agatha leaned into her. “That was both cliché and charming.”</p><p>“That’s my goal, baby.” Rio smiled as she leaned in, before pursing her lips to meet Agatha’s a sweet kiss, only for the distant approach of high heels to remind her where she was. After a quick peck on her lips, she cleared her throat and composed herself, awaiting the arrival of one of her employees.</p><p>And when said employee came into view, she felt Agatha’s body instantly tense.</p><p>“Rio! You’re here!”</p><p>“Honey,” Rio addressed her formally. “How are you?”</p><p>“I’m great,” Honey smiled brightly as she walked over to meet them. “I’m working hard to get everything wrapped up here. While I have loved the experience, I’m looking forward to being stateside again.”</p><p>Rio nodded in acknowledgement. “Well. I’m here to finish what I need to do on the ground before we head home. I also wanted to show Agatha the progress.”</p><p>Honey looked to Agatha. “Nice to see you again.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a tight smile. “Rio told me we’ll be seeing more of each other now you’re moving to the New York offices.”</p><p>“Oh?” Honey raised an eyebrow. “Are you working for the company now?”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “No, no. I’ll be just stopping by to see my fiancée.”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha questioningly, even more so when she placed her left hand possessively on her shoulder, getting the ring on full display.</p><p>Honey’s eyes seemed to zero straight in on it, and Rio saw her eyes widen. “Oh? Oh wow. Congrats.”</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha reached up and tucked a strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear. “We’re very happy.”</p><p>Rio smiled at her fiancée. She knew what she was doing, but she couldn’t deny it was true. She’d never been so happy in her life.</p><p>Honey cleared her throat. “I have the forms for you to sign ready on your desk.”</p><p>“Perfect. Thanks, Honey. We’ll get those signed and be out of your hair.”</p><p>Rio led Agatha to her office, and was pleased to see that Honey had indeed got the forms ready for her. She skim-read the first one and put pen to paper, before moving on to the next. By the fourth one, she saw her fiancée getting restless.</p><p>“Why don’t you go explore?” Rio suggested. “I’ll find you when these are done.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Like I’m giving <em>her</em> a chance to be in here alone with you.”</p><p>“Sweetheart, I think you’ve staked your claim. I promise if she tries anything, I’ll tell her to leave.”</p><p>“And if she doesn’t?”</p><p>“She will,” Rio assured. “I can still veto that New York move. In fact, it would give me cause to do so.”</p><p>Agatha got to her feet. “I am intrigued to see what the bar looks like.”</p><p>“Exactly like you suggested, my love,” Rio admitted. “My interior designer was as impressed as I was.”</p><p>Agatha blinked with clear surprise. “Really? You went with my idea?”</p><p>“Of course, and I hope that you’ll give me ideas for all my hotels. This is a family company, and that equals you and me, and I guess Lilia too.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and moved round the desk to kiss her cheek. “Then I best take a look at my handywork.”</p><p>Rio watched her go, saddened when the door shut between them and she could no longer see the sway of Agatha’s hips as she walked away. She focused on the forms, signing where she needed to and making sure everything was as they should be. Still, in the back of her mind, all she could think about was the night ahead. She wanted to take Agatha somewhere nice for dinner, perhaps have a drink at the bar of their hotel, before retiring to their room and making love until they were truly spent.</p><p>Rio wondered if that was how her life would be from now on. That work would always be the prelude to returning home into her soon-to-be wife’s arms. She loved her company, and she would always be committed to the company, but it didn’t dominate her thoughts anymore. Now her mind was full of thoughts of cute dates, living arrangements, and eventual wedding planning. Perhaps that’s how it should be. Perhaps it was time for her to live for herself and not her family name. After all, as it stood, the Vidal name died with her, and unless she and Agatha had children, she was the end of the line. Then her empire would be scrapped for parts, and all her work would be moulded into someone else’s vision. Yet if they had a child, someone to pass it all too, then she needed to leave them an empire worthy of inheriting, and to teach them to do the same as her father had done with her.</p><p>Her thoughts were interrupted by a light knock on her door.</p><p>“Come in,” she called out. The door opened and Honey walked in.</p><p>“How’s the forms going?”</p><p>“Good.” Rio looked back to said papers and continued to read. “I should have them done soon.”</p><p>She heard the door click shut.</p><p>“You’re engaged?”</p><p>Rio didn’t look up. “Yes, I am.”</p><p>“That was quick.”</p><p>“What’s the point in waiting when you know they’re the one?”</p><p>“Okay, fair point,” Honey said with a light laugh. “I’m happy for you.”</p><p>Rio looked up at her sceptically. “You are?”</p><p>Honey nodded. “I…I care about you, Rio. You’ve done a lot for me and maybe…maybe I misread things. I mean, you can’t blame me for…for forming feelings. You’re amazing, and charming, and very good looking, but I know you don’t see me like that, and I got so swept up in the idea of you that I…I let my feelings get in the way of professionalism and I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Apology accepted.” Rio gave her a small smile. “I appreciate it and I’m sorry if I did give you any impression that I…”</p><p>“You didn’t,” Honey quickly insisted. “Looking back, it’s pretty obvious you’ve only had eyes for one person this whole time, and it wasn’t me.”</p><p>“You’re right,” Rio admitted. “Agatha is…she’s the love of my life.”</p><p>Honey smiled. “Then I’m glad you found her.”</p><p>At that moment, the office door swung open.</p><p>“The bar looks amazing! The mirrored tiles really do…” Agatha paused, looking between them before folding her arms. “Well, this is cosy.”</p><p>“Honey was just congratulating us again on the engagement,” Rio told her. “We’ve had a good chat. Everything’s good.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows. “Oh really?”</p><p>“Yes,” Honey insisted, before smiling. “So, what romantic plans do you have this evening?”</p><p>“Rio is taking me out for dinner,” Agatha answered. “Where, I do not know.”</p><p>“I’m still deciding,” Rio admitted. “Too many great ones to choose from.”</p><p>“Oh, what about that make-your-own pizza place we went to?” Honey suggested. “That was fun.”</p><p>There was a long pause.</p><p>“You two went out to dinner together?”</p><p>“It was…” Rio began, but Honey cut her off.</p><p>“Yeah, it was a good night. Though my pizza dough bubbled up and looked like a monster!”</p><p>“Oh really?”</p><p>“Yeah, I’d never made pizza before. Rio lied and said she hadn’t too, so I didn’t look like an idiot in front of the others.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “The others?”</p><p>“It was a team bonding night,” Rio clarified. “Everyone was there.”</p><p>She saw Agatha relax, and she could finally do the same.</p><p>“Yeah,” Honey backed up. “No one makes jokes about the boss, so I was saved.”</p><p>“Well, my fiancée has a kind heart,” Agatha commented. “Sometimes a little <em>too</em> kind.”</p><p>Rio looked back to her forms. Okay, she still wasn’t happy. The goal was to get them out before she got even more unhappy.</p><p>“Well, I need to go make sure the furniture delivery matches in invoice,” Honey announced. “Leave the forms on the desk and I’ll sort them once you’re both gone.”</p><p>“Thanks, Honey.”</p><p>“Anytime, boss.” Honey headed for the door. “Have a good time, you two.”</p><p>As soon as the door shut, Agatha perched on her desk. “Did she come on to you?”</p><p>“What?” Rio looked up at her, wide eyed. “No, no, she was fine.”</p><p>Agatha raised a sceptical eyebrow.</p><p>“She was,” Rio insisted. “She even apologised.”</p><p>“She did, did she?” Agatha pursed her lips. “She’s up to something.”</p><p>“Or nothing,” Rio countered. “Either way, there’s nothing she can do. I’ll always be yours.”</p><p>Agatha reached down and cupped Rio’s cheek. “I can’t wait to get back to the hotel tonight.”</p><p>Rio gulped. Suddenly heading back there immediately sounded like the best idea ever. “Where do you want to go to dinner?”</p><p>“I don’t care,” Agatha answered. “Just not pizza.”</p><p>Rio chuckled as she signed yet another form. “As you wish, my love.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha had a plan. One she thought would have been fool-proof. She insisted she needed to change before dinner, so they’d need to go back to the hotel. Which would have resulted in them both naked in bed, preferably with the strap.</p><p>Instead, Rio took her fucking clothes shopping. And not even for lingerie!</p><p>This time, Rio called for a driver, and they were soon dropped off outside of a large store.</p><p>“La Rinascente,” Rio said as they headed inside. “The best department store in Rome.”</p><p>The store was huge, like a vertical shopping mall, but much busier and ten times as fancy. Designer brands were advertised all around, each more luxurious than the last. It was the kind of place normal people visited to simply marvel, but Rio was there armed with her millions and entirely motivated to make her smile. </p><p>“Pick whatever you want,” Rio insisted. “Don’t even look at the price.”</p><p>“Rio, I could literally spend a million in here!”</p><p>“You won’t,” Rio assured. “There’s no Hermès, though if you want a Birkin, I can order us a viewing back in New York.”</p><p>“I thought there was a waiting list?”</p><p>“For most people,” Rio answered. “Not me.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Fine, but you have to buy something too!”</p><p>“Whatever you wish, my love.”</p><p>After an hour perusing, Agatha had caught the shopping bug, perusing the store while Rio carried her maybe purchases. The salesgirl, of course, was ecstatic. </p><p>“How about this one?” She held up a black sleeveless jumpsuit. “Stylish and classic.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Oh, it’s perfect! Rio, now we need to pick something for you.”</p><p>Rio looked around and balanced Agatha’s pile so she could pick a black leather jacket off the rail. “I like this.”</p><p>Agatha put a hand on her hip. “That’s not entirely fair.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “It was a coincidence it was right there.”</p><p> After trying everything on, Agatha reluctantly allowed Rio to buy her three outfits, two new perfumes, and a new pair of heels. One of which outfits she wore to go. </p><p>They decided to have a drink on the rooftop bar to watch the sunset, and Agatha found her mood had recuperated from the Honey incident. </p><p>“It’s beautiful,” she said as she looked out to the city. “You’re so lucky to have stayed here for so long.”</p><p>Rio shrugged. “To be honest, I spent most of the time wishing I wasn’t here.” </p><p>“Really?” Agatha couldn’t believe it. “But why? The view, the food, the history, the culture.”</p><p>“I know, I know. I was just lovesick, I guess.”</p><p>“Was?” Agatha questioned. “Are you cured?”</p><p>“Never,” Rio said with a grin. “Just found myself a good treatment plan.”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Oh yeah?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “And I can’t wait for my next dose.”</p><p>Agatha checked her watch. “Let’s go get a quick burger or something. I want to have an early night.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Are you tired? I know it’s been a long day.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m not tired,” she insisted. “I just want to get you in bed, Ms Vidal.”</p><p>Rio quickly got the bill, and soon they were in a queue at McDonald’s. </p><p>“We need to go shopping when we get back to New York,” Agatha mused as she clutched Rio’s hand with both of hers. </p><p>“You want to go to Hermès?” Rio asked and Agatha giggled, before leaning in to whisper in her ear. </p><p>“I was thinking more like a toy shop.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “Why would you want to go to a…<em>oh.</em>”</p><p>Agatha smirked. “Maybe we can have a look online later.”</p><p>Rio gulped and nodded.</p><p>They ate their burgers quietly at a table for two, Agatha making sure to brush her foot against Rio’s calf as much as possible. </p><p>As soon as they were done, Rio threw away their wrappings and took her hand. Agatha laughed to herself as Rio dragged her off in the direction of their hotel, which luckily was only a few blocks away.</p><p>When they made it inside, Rio made a b-line for the bar and ordered a bottle of champagne, before leading Agatha to the elevator. Unfortunately, there was someone already waiting, so they had to stand in impatient silence until they got off at the floor below them. As soon as they doors shut behind them, Rio took her hand.</p><p>“I want you so much.”</p><p>Agatha smirked and decided, in that moment, she was taking charge. As soon as the lift chimed and the doors opened at their floor, she dragged Rio towards their room, stepping aside for her to open the door before ushering her inside.</p><p>She shut the door with Rio’s body, kissing her fiercely. Like her life depended on it, as in that moment it felt like it just might.</p><p>She pulled back for air, looking at Rio’s equally breathless form. Taking in her darkened eyes and flushed cheeks. Oh, she had never wanted to fuck anyone more.</p><p>“Come on.” Agatha pulled Rio towards the bedroom. “I can’t wait anymore.”</p><p>By the time they reached the bedroom door, their lips had found each other once more, and Agatha relished in the feeling of Rio’s tongue in her mouth. Even her kisses were addictive, let alone everything else. It was safe to say she was a total goner, and that night she decided to fall in even deeper.</p><p>This time when she pulled back, it wasn’t just for air. It was to ask the question she’d been dying to ask.</p><p>“Can we try something?”</p><p>“Whatever you want,” Rio said dreamily. “Absolutely anything.”</p><p>Agatha reached into her case and pulled out the harness and lube. “I want to wear the strap.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened before looking at the silicone shaft. “Agatha, I…I don’t know…”</p><p>“We don’t have to,” Agatha assured softly. “I know this would be your first time…receiving. I mean, I’m guessing party girl didn’t have a strap lying around.”</p><p>Rio laughed shyly. “No, I don’t think she was that prepared.”</p><p>“Well, I am, and I want to make you feel good. You can tap out at any point but I think you’ll be…pleasantly surprised.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath before nodding. “Okay, let’s do it.”</p><p>Agatha grinned and quickly stripped off her clothes, watching as Rio did the same.</p><p>“Get on the bed,” she instructed as she fastened the strap around her waist. Once it was secure, she climbed onto the bed, grabbing the lube and gathering some on her fingers.</p><p>“I need to prep you,” she told Rio. “Spread your legs, my love.”</p><p>Rio opened her thighs, revealing her already sodden centre. Agatha’s mouth watered, wanting nothing more than to stick her tongue right in, but she had a task at hand. And so instead, it was her fingers that had the pleasure of sliding into Rio’s warmth.</p><p>She set a soft rhythm, prepping the lube inside her as Rio tipped her head back and moaned. From the way she was clenching her fingers, it seemed Rio had been just as worked up as she was.</p><p>Once she was sure she was ready, Agatha pulled her fingers out and poured more lube into her hand. She smothered the dildo in the smooth liquid, before climbing over Rio properly. Reaching down, she settled the tip of the shaft against her entrance.</p><p>“If you tell me to stop, I’ll stop,” she promised. “I’d never want to hurt you.”</p><p>Rio nodded, biting her lip so hard it had gone white.</p><p>Agatha gathered herself before pressing forward, applying enough gentle pressure as the head nudged against Rio’s entrance, meeting resistance before finally sliding smoothly inside.</p><p>Rio’s body tensed.</p><p>“Fuckfuckfuckfuck.”</p><p>“Babe?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio insisted, though her voice was strained, braced. “K-keep going.”</p><p>Agatha pushed forward a bit more, watching as Rio’s eyes widened. Then, with a little huh, she pushed all the way in. Her fiancée’s legs locked around her waist while her arms held her close in a vice grip.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Just…can we stay like this a minute?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Let me know when.”</p><p>They lay there in silence, Agatha waiting for Rio to tell her to pull out. It wasn’t a big deal. Some people just liked giving, and there was no shame in that. Even if the thought of never getting to strap her future wife was a sad one, she was sure she’d find other ways of keeping the passion alive.</p><p>Then, eventually, Rio spoke. “Move. Please, move.”</p><p>Agatha braced herself, pulling her hips back before pushing home once more. Rio’s breath hitched sharply, but she remained quiet. Agatha did it again, and again, and again, finding a slow rhythm.</p><p>Rio moaned against her ear. “That feels good.”</p><p>Agatha smirked as she began to build momentum, nipping at Rio’s neck as her moans bounced off the walls. The sounds were feeding her own desire, the strap having the perfect stimulation at the base. No wonder Rio had barely let her come up for air with this thing.</p><p>She lifted her head and leaned over her fiancée. “You like this, baby?”</p><p>Rio looked up at her, breathless, flushed, her breasts bouncing with each thrust. Yet what caught Agatha’s attention was her smile. One of excitement, desire, and pure happiness.</p><p>“I love it so much,” Rio insisted. “I love feeling you inside me.”</p><p>Agatha leaned over her, thrusting deep. She swore she could feel the way Rio was squeezing around the shaft, and the sensation went straight to her clit. She ground hard against the base, her own pleasure building.</p><p>Suddenly she felt Rio’s mouth latch on to her breast, sucking against it greedily. Agatha gasped, grinding deep and hard, before she felt Rio’s hips buck before locking up. The sight, the sound, the feeling of the strap pressed back towards her was enough to make Agatha shatter with her.</p><p>Soon they collapsed on to the mattress, their limbs twitching as they came down from their intense orgasms. Once Agatha regained her bearings, she carefully pulled out and unclasped the strap, tossing it to the end of the bed before settling back against her warm, naked fiancee.</p><p>They lay there in silence for a while, until Rio eventually spoke up.</p><p>“I’m going to tell Alice.”</p><p>“You are?”</p><p>Rio reached for her phone. “If she doesn’t like it, it’s tough. I love you and I’m marrying you with or without your blessing.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but swoon and snuggled against Rio’s side as she watched her type out the news. As soon as the text was sent, Rio set her phone aside and rolled them over so she was back on top.</p><p>“Can I wear it now?”</p><p>Agatha giggled at the ridiculousness but nodded either way. “Go right ahead, babe. We have all night.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio woke up the next morning to the sound of her phone. She checked the time and saw it was almost half-past nine. It seemed they had exhausted themselves too much to set an alarm. She smiled at the memories, thankful she was her own boss. </p><p>Agatha patted the side of her face, her eyes clenched shut. “Rio, turn it off.”</p><p>Rio swung out of bed, ignoring the numb ache between her legs as she picked up the phone and head out into the living area. She looked at the ID and saw it was Alice. Nerves rose in her chest as she answered.</p><p>“Hey Al, how-”</p><p><em>“Are you alone?”</em></p><p>Rio frowned. “Yeah, why?”</p><p><em>“Agatha isn’t there?”</em></p><p>“She’s in the bedroom. I stepped out so I didn’t disturb her,” Rio explained. “Why are you-”</p><p><em>“Rio, you need to listen to me very carefully, okay?”</em></p><p>“Alice, what are you-”</p><p><em>“Please, Rio. Just let me talk, okay?”</em></p><p>“Okay, what’s up?”</p><p>She heard Alice suck in a sharp breath. <em>“Rio…Agatha isn’t who you think she is.”</em></p><p>And just like that, the bubble burst.</p>

<p>Rio’s frown deepened. “What do you mean? She’s my fiancée. Of course I know who-”</p><p><em>“I’ll explain,”</em> Alice promised. <em>“Just please listen to me because there is no way you can marry that woman, Rio.”</em></p><p>“Why the hell not?” Rio demanded, moving into the spare bedroom. “What’s going on, Alice?”</p><p><em>“You know I’m staying with Nat and Yelena, right?”</em></p><p>“Yeah?”</p><p><em>“Well Yelena invited this girl, Kate and when I said about you being engaged to Agatha, she got really quiet. At first, she wouldn’t tell us why, but Yelena managed to get it out of her this morning. Turns out she’s Eleanor Bishop’s daughter.”</em></p><p>“Eleanor Bishop?” Rio questioned. “She was the one pissing Agatha off at the charity event, right?”</p><p><em>“Yes, but Rio it’s not just mean girl stuff. Like…Kate said there’s this rumour…”</em></p><p>Rio huffed. “You of all people should know that rumours don’t mean anything.”</p><p><em>“I know but Rio will you please just listen, okay? Right, so Kate’s mom is older than Agatha, but she remembers her well enough. Apparently, Agatha’s mom would say she was struggling with her, that she was acting out and rebelling. She…she said Agatha was stealing things. Taking money, jewellery, anything. She’d confronted her about it, but she never had proof. It was getting worse, then the next thing anyone knew her mom was dead. She fell down the stairs and hit her head.”</em></p><p>Rio bit her lip. Agatha hadn’t told her how her mom died, but she figured it was sudden. “She argued with her mom a lot. So what? From what I heard she tried Agatha terribly.”</p><p><em>“Well, the police brought Agatha in for questioning afterwards. No one knows really what about, but people suspect that it was less of a fall and more of a…well a shove.”</em></p><p>“What?”</p><p><em>“They think it wasn’t an accident, that Agatha pushed her. That she…”</em> Alice had the grace not to say the words out loud, but the silence said enough.</p><p>Rio gritted her teeth. “Well clearly not, because she’s not in prison for murder.”</p><p><em>“Not if they have no evidence,” </em>Alice argued.<em> “But she was about to be disinherited, so she had motive. She just didn’t know her mom changed the will before she died. Then when her mom’s family wouldn’t deal with her, she manipulated Lilia into taking over her guardianship and bled her for all she could too.”</em></p><p>“That’s bullshit,” Rio insisted. “Agatha doesn’t want money, and she was just a kid when her mom died. You can’t expect a teenager to have been so calculated.”</p><p><em>“I’m just repeating what Kate told me, and to be quite honest Agatha does have a devious side. Jen told me what she was like in school. How she’d use people, and trick people. Even Kate agrees it doesn’t seem out of character.”</em></p><p>“Well, you tell <em>Kate</em> to never repeat it again or she’ll have a defamation suit filed against her and her bitch mother.”</p><p><em>“Rio, just listen…”</em></p><p>“No, and if I hear a word of this again, Alice, I’ll sue you too.”</p><p>Rio ended the call before quickly calling her lawyer.</p><p><em>“Rio?”</em> Matt answered the phone groggily. <em>“What’s wrong?”</em></p><p>“I want to send a cease and desist to Eleanor Bishop?”</p><p><em>“The CEO? Why?”</em></p><p>“She’s spreading false rumours about my fiancée.”</p><p><em>“You’re engaged? Congratulations!”</em></p><p>“Yes, yes, so will you send it?”</p><p><em>“What are these rumours?”</em></p><p>“She’s saying my fiancée is a murderer and a thief!”</p><p>There was a long pause before Matt cleared her throat. <em>“Right, tell me everything.”</em></p><p>Rio recited all that Alice had told her, dropping in context here and there. Once she was done, Matt cleared his throat again.</p><p><em>“Right, just leave this with me. But do not mention anything about this to anyone, okay? We need to handle this sensitively.”</em></p><p>“Okay, what’s the next steps then?”</p><p><em>“The next step is you enjoy your vacation a little longer. We’ll regroup in person.”</em></p><p>“Alright.” Rio relented. “But I’m serious, Matt.”</p><p><em>“I know,”</em> he assured<em>. “Just leave it with me.”</em></p><p>The call ended, and Rio sat down on the edge of the spare bed. It wasn’t true. She already knew it wasn’t true. Agatha wouldn’t do that. She could never do that. Sure, she was a little rough around the edges, but she would never…she could never…could she?</p><p>She shook the thoughts away. There was no way she was stooping to the lows of Eleanor Bishop and her group of gossips. No, she would make sure no one would dare utter such speculation again. After all, Agatha was her family now, and she’d always be in her corner.</p><p>For better or for worst, even if they hadn’t said their vows yet.</p><p>Rio got up and made her way back to the bedroom. Agatha was still asleep, face-planting the pillow. She smiled at the sight and quickly climbed into bed, snuggling up against her fiancée.</p><p>Agatha grumbled before raising her head slightly. “Who was on the phone?”</p><p>“Alice,” Rio said simply. “Nothing exciting.”</p><p>“And she’s fine with us being engaged?”</p><p>Rio panicked. “Erm…”</p><p>Agatha chuckled. “It’s okay. She’ll come around, I’m sure of it.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer, just held her close.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You’ll never lose me. You know that, right?”</p><p>Agatha took her hand, pulling her arm even tighter around her. “Good, because I’ve become quite fond of you.”</p><p>Rio smiled and placed a kiss to her shoulder, sealing the promise. Forever and always.  </p><p> </p><p>Rio was acting fucking weird.</p><p>Even weirder than normal.</p><p>She had been clingy all day, which for Rio was saying something. She had held her hand as they walked to a cute bakery for some breakfast, pulled out her chair, and linked their ankles under the table as they ate. On the surface, that wasn’t odd. Rio loved physical contact (especially in private), but this was more intense. Like Rio was scared she’d float away.</p><p>Yep. Alice had definitely said something.</p><p>She just had to work out what, because like hell she was going to let someone upset her Rio. Not on her watch.</p><p>She suggested they go for a walk, so Rio of course suggested they walk miles to the Villa Borghese Gardens, and before she knew it, Agatha was sat in a rowboat.</p><p>The Gardens were admittedly beautiful, with luscious trees and interesting statues and fountains. The little lake, however, was wonderous. Floating in the calm waters before the Temple of Aesculapius, she marvelled at the surrounding paradise as ducks, geese and even small turtles swam by them.</p><p>Still, it all paled in comparison to the vision of Rio taking charge of the oars, her muscles flexing in the late-morning sun.</p><p>“I’m rethinking this whole boat thing,” she said with a smirk. “Maybe I just need you to row me and I’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Then I can take you on the boats in central park?”</p><p>Agatha grimaced. “No way. I dread to think what’s in that water.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “It’s fine. Me and Alice go all the time.”</p><p>“You do?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah, it’s a good place to talk things over. No interruptions, and no avoiding.”</p><p>Agatha considered her words. This was, in fact, the best opportunity to talk about this.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Is everything okay?”</p><p>She saw Rio frown under her sunglasses. “Why wouldn’t they be?”</p><p>“Because since you spoke to Alice this morning, something’s been off.”</p><p>“Everything’s fine,” Rio assured. “Or it will be soon.”</p><p>“Yes, but what’s wrong?” Agatha pressed. “I could help…”</p><p>“No,” Rio quickly stopped her. “I’m dealing with it.”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms. “If it involves me, I have the right to know.”</p><p>“I know, but…”</p><p>“No buts. I’m a big girl. You can tell me.”</p><p>Rio avoided her gaze as she rowed the boat at a slower pace. “Erm Alice is staying with our friends and one of them has invited this girl...”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Has she cheated on Jen?”</p><p>“What? God no! She’d never.”</p><p>“Then what is it?”</p><p>Rio looked even more sheepish. “See, the girl is, well, she’s, erm, Eleanor Bishop’s daughter.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. She knew this would happen sooner or later.</p><p>“Fucking Ellie. Could never keep her mouth shut, so I guess it’s a hereditary trait.”</p><p>“I don’t believe it,” Rio quickly insisted. “I never would.”</p><p>Agatha smiled at Rio’s words. “Thank you.”</p><p>“You should have told me, though. I’m your fiancée. We shouldn’t hide things.”</p><p>“I didn’t want to acknowledge it,” Agatha admitted. “I’ve spent all my life getting away from that entire toxic circle. I didn’t want that here. Not when we have something good.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t let anything ruin this,” Rio said adamantly. “But I don’t like it.”</p><p>“I know, but I’ve learnt it’s best just to leave it.” Agatha saw Rio look away sharply and frown. “Rio?”</p><p>“Huh?”</p><p>She raised an eyebrow. “What did you do?”</p><p>“I didn’t like that people were spreading lies about you,” Rio explained. “So, I’ve got my lawyer to draft a cease and desist…”</p><p>“Call him now and tell him to stop.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“I’m serious, Rio. Tell him to stop.”</p><p>“Okay.” Rio got out her phone and brought it to her ear. “Hey Matt…Yes, I know but I want to cancel the request I made this morning, or last night for you…I know but Agatha and I have talked, and we want to put this behind us…thanks, speak to you soon.”</p><p>Rio put her phone back in her pocket and looked at her sheepishly. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha pursed her lips and nodded. She knew Rio had acted to defend her, but this was the last thing they needed.</p><p>“Let’s just enjoy this,” Agatha suggested. “Us. Here. Together.”</p><p>Rio hesitated for a moment before nodding. “Fine, but I…I don’t like this, Agatha.”</p><p>“I know, my love,” Agatha said sadly. “I know.”</p><p> </p><p>They’d spent the afternoon at the hotel, and Rio was thankful that Honey was out of the office. That would have only added fuel to the fire.</p><p>Instead, Rio worked while Agatha explored once more. She liked that her fiancée was interested in her work, and not in the money side, either.</p><p>Rio finished the piece of paperwork she was reviewing and tapped her phone screen. The wallpaper had been newly changed to one of their engagement photos. The sight never failed to make her smile. She loved Agatha so much that sometimes it felt like she was going to ascend into pure sunlight whenever she saw her smile.</p><p>Yet seeing her sad, imagining what she’d been through, felt like a knife to the heart. She’d burn the world down for Agatha (not literally as that would be hurtful for the environment, but metaphorically she would), yet this was something she couldn’t undo. The years of torment and isolation. She wished they had met sooner. Maybe then she could have stopped it getting to that point. Yet what could she have done? Agatha was just a kid when it happened, and she was older but just as naïve, before tragedy made her grow up in an instant.</p><p>Still, she had to think of the future. Their future, filled with love and happiness.</p><p>Then, the image on her phone was disrupted by a notification.</p><p><strong>ALICE</strong></p><p><em>Are we going to talk?</em></p><p>Rio glared at the screen, determined to ignore it, but the urge to respond was too strong.</p><p><strong>RIO</strong></p><p><em>unless it’s you apologising no.</em></p><p><strong>ALICE</strong></p><p><em>I won’t apologise for trying to look out for you. </em></p><p><strong>RIO</strong></p><p><em>if you were really looking out for me, you’d have defended my fiancée. </em></p><p><strong>ALICE</strong></p><p><em>I’d rather be wrong and apologise than let you lose everything!</em></p><p><strong>RIO</strong></p><p><em>i won’t lose everything. i’m not stupid.</em></p><p><strong>ALICE</strong></p><p><em>When it comes to her, yes you are!</em></p><p>Rio set her phone down and folded her arms. Alice was being totally unreasonable, and she wasn’t arguing with her about this. Agatha was there to stay, and Alice would have to lump it. But she didn’t want this. She wanted Alice by her side, to get on with Agatha and be a big part of their lives. If only she didn’t blindly believe the first negative thing she heard.</p><p>Fuck Eleanor Bishop and her mean girl clique.</p><p>She carried on with her work, and was just about to sign the last document when the door to her office opened and Agatha walked in. “You ready to get out of here yet?”</p><p>Rio smiled and signed her name one last time. “All sorted, my love.”</p><p>After a quiet dinner and a very long shared shower back in their hotel room, Rio sat in her robe at the piano. She never really understood why it became a fashion for high-end rooms to have a piano. Personally, she’d prefer to use the space for comfort rather than activities. Yet as she waited for Agatha to finish crying her hair, she found herself opening it up and playing on the keys.</p><p>She wasn’t a master at piano, but she could play well enough. Her fingers graced over the keys, at first in random succession, until they began to play a familiar tune. <em>The Ballad of the Witches’ Road.</em> She smiled sadly, remembering all the nights she played as Alice’s instrumental back-up for impromptu performances. They had always been a good team, though now she felt they were divided more than they’d ever been.</p><p>“I didn’t know you could play,” Agatha commented as she stepped out the bathroom in her own robe, hair freshly dry.</p><p>“Sometimes,” Rio answered as she turned to face her. “Another lonely child hobby.”</p><p>Agatha sat down on the closest end of the couch. “That’s Alice’s song, right?”</p><p>“Her moms originally,” Rio answered. “I used to step in on piano sometimes when she was doing pop-up gigs, or at parties.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “I’d like to see that. Maybe you could perform at this engagement party we’re inevitably going to have whether we want to or not.”</p><p>“Maybe.” Rio’s mood saddened once more. “I spoke with her again. Alice, I mean It…I need to try sort this face to face when we’re both back in New York.”</p><p>She watched Agatha’s face fall solemn. “I take it she still thinks I’m a murdering thief?”</p><p>“She’s just looking out for me,” Rio defended. “I’ll talk her round.”</p><p>“But what if you can’t?”</p><p>Rio shrugged her shoulders. “I don’t know. I just have to hope that we can get through this. Me and her, I mean. Us two are fine.”</p><p>“Are we?” Agatha questioned, at which Rio frowned.</p><p>“Why wouldn’t we be?”</p><p>“I mean I know for a fact your lawyer will be hellbent on writing the most airtight prenup in existence after this.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “I’m sure he would be anyway.”</p><p>“I know, it’s just…I don’t want people to look at you and see this stupid mess from years ago. I don’t want to drag you down.”</p><p>“You’d never drag me down,” Rio insisted. “You could never. I love you.”</p><p>“Rio, loving me has nothing to do with this.”</p><p>“Okay, then what does?”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her lap. “I should have told you all this from the start, though I guess you already knew I wasn’t well liked.”</p><p>“Considering you accused me of trying to play a trick on you when I just wanted to buy you are drink, I gathered as much.”</p><p>“And it’ll get worse,” Agatha warned. “Every event, every party. They’ll look down at me, they’ll tease me, and they’ll mock you for being foolish enough to want me.”</p><p>“I’m not foolish,” Rio insisted. “And if that’s the case, we’ll never go to a party again, or I’ll go by myself. But being married to you would never bring me shame. If they can’t see how lucky I am to have you, then it’s their loss.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a moment before getting up from the couch. “I’m going to go to bed.”</p><p>Rio frowned and got to her feet. “Have I upset you?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha answered. “This whole situation upsets me. I just wish…I wish you weren’t rich. That we were just two normal people, and we could just get on with our lives without all this fucking bullshit.”</p><p>Rio stared at her a moment, not quite believing what she was hearing. “But Agatha, I’ve always been like this. This company is in my family, my blood. It’s a huge part of my life. Of who I am. I wouldn’t be me without all this.”</p><p>“You would,” Agatha insisted. “You’d just be you who, I don’t know, ran an Airbnb rather than a billion-dollar company.”</p><p>“A company my dad built, and his dad before that, and his before that. Starting from one hotel and building it into this. It’s their legacy, and now mine. It means a lot to me.”</p><p>“I know, my love,” Agatha insisted. “I didn’t mean…”</p><p>“But what did you mean?” Rio questioned. “I’ve worked so hard to build what I could, okay? The company nearly fell apart when my parents died and I fought to keep it because this is all I have left, Agatha. This is all of my family that I have now. It’s not an inconvenience.”</p><p>“I know, Rio. I shouldn’t have said that.”</p><p>“But you did.” Rio couldn’t deny it. Agatha had said it, and now it played over and over in her mind. She closed the lid on the piano and walked past her fiancée towards the bedroom.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“I think we should go to sleep,” Rio suggested without looking back, trying to stop the tears from falling. “It’s our last day here tomorrow. We need to make the most of it.”</p><p>She heard Agatha’s padded footsteps behind her, felt her grasp her hand as they entered the bedroom, but Rio didn’t look back. In the morning, they’d talk, but for now she needed to rest her troubled mind and hope sleep would heal the pain in her heart.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha woke up before Rio, before sunrise even. To her relief, Rio’s arms were wrapped around her, her breath catching the back of her neck. It seemed Rio wasn’t so upset that she didn’t instinctively reach for her, but she knew she needed to fix this. Because she wasn’t going to lose Rio. Not when she…not when she’d already fallen head over heels in love with her.</p><p>A rush of adrenaline raced through her. It was the first time she’d admitted it, even to herself. Though really, it was obvious. After all, why else would she rush into an engagement? Some would say it was for money, especially those who listened to Eleanor Bishop’s wicked words, but no, it had been about Rio.</p><p>It had always been about Rio</p><p>How could it not be? Why had she not just had that first dinner and left it? Why had she flown out to Italy when she could have stayed home and enjoyed her break in peace? Why had she let Rio drag her back into a world she had resented for so long?</p><p>It took her longer, but she had gotten there eventually; unable to imagine a future that didn’t involve Rio at her side.</p><p>And so, as she lay there waiting for the summer sunrise, Operation Tell-Rio-She-Loved-Her came to be.</p><p>Realistically, she could just tell her. Bring her a coffee when she woke up and say ‘I’m sorry. I love you.’ Yet she figured she owed Rio more than that. So, she got out her phone and started booking. And when Rio did wake up, she greeted her with that coffee.</p><p>“Good morning.”</p><p>“Morning.” Rio offered a small smile and accepted the coffee. “You’re up early.”</p><p>“Couldn’t sleep,” Agatha admitted as she perched on the bed beside her. “I’m sorry, Rio. I never meant what I said. I love how passionate you are, and how much you care about your family legacy and use it all to help people and, well, fish, I guess. I just…I don’t know, wish we didn’t have to deal with all the bullshit, but I guess we’d have to in some form regardless of our situation. So I’m sorry. I truly am.”</p><p>Rio’s smile warmed and she leaned up to kiss her cheek. “All is forgiven, my love. I do appreciate this is hard for you, even more so now. But we’ll make it work, okay? It may take some time, but soon we’ll find our place, and we’ll be the happiest two people have ever been.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed her. “Well drink up. We’re getting croissants and heading on a guided tour of the Colosseum.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “We are?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Then after some lunch, we’re going to the Roman Forum.”</p><p>“You’ve organised all this?”</p><p>“I wanted to treat you for a change,” Agatha admitted. “I know it’s not much, but…”</p><p>“I can’t wait!” Rio grinned. “Thank you, my love.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her again. Part one of the plan was complete, now to part two.</p><p>The Colosseum guided tour was interesting, taking them to areas not open to general admission. They walked the steps of gladiators, listening to the guides facts and stores as they explored, before heading up to the upper levels.</p><p>Rio held her hand, taking everything in. As they reached the top level, looking over the full structure, Agatha marvelled at the way Rio studied everything with pure admiration. She had the sudden urge to drive Rio up to Amherst, to show her the Emily Dickinson museum and tell her everything she knew.</p><p>“Let me take a picture of you,” Agatha offered as she pulled out her phone. Rio turned her back on the ruins and smiling back at her as she took a few snaps.</p><p>“I want one of you,” Rio insisted, and they swapped places. Agatha smiled equally as bright. How could she not when she was looking at the woman she loved?</p><p>“Do you want me to take one of both of you,” their tour guide offered, and Rio quickly handed over her phone, moving beside her.</p><p>They took a few pictures, mostly smiles and one with Rio kissing her cheek. When the tour guide handed back the phone, Rio quickly skimmed through them and grinned.</p><p>“I’m getting these framed!”</p><p>Agatha shook her head but hugged Rio’s arm anyway.</p><p>They stopped off to get some sandwiches nearby, and as they ate, Rio chatted away, reciting all the facts she found interesting.</p><p>“I just can’t believe they hit watched in there to have mock naval battles. Every time I go, I just can’t get my head around it.”</p><p>“How many times have you visited?” Agatha asked, and Rio shrugged.</p><p>“Maybe six times.”</p><p>“Six?!”</p><p>“I find it interesting!”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “I can’t wait to take you to Amherst.”</p><p>“You can’t?”</p><p>“And I can be your personal tour guide.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “We can go as soon as we get back!”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Maybe we can go in the fall.”</p><p>“I’ll hold you to that, Harkness,” Rio said with a smirk, and it took everything in Agatha not to dive across the table and kiss her, but she had to wait. Rio was happy and so part two of the plan was complete.</p><p>Next was the all-important part three.</p><p> The Roman Forum was tragically beautiful. The remnants of a once great civilization taken over my nature, surrounded by the vibrant city that was built upon its foundations. They walked through the ruins, Rio stopping to read every signpost of information.</p><p>“I love this place,” Rio admitted as stood on Palatine Hill, looking down on the fragmented temples below. “It’s so surreal.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha agreed. “It’s hard to imagine this being the heart of, well, everything. And here it is, just stones and pillars.”</p><p>Once more, Rio’s face was filled with fascination, and in the sunlight of early afternoon, she glowed like the gods whose temples once stood tall before them. That was the moment, she decided.</p><p>“Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>Agatha went to reply, but the words caught in her throat. She closed her eyes and looked down, only to see something glistening at her feet. She reached down to pick it up, studying it as she stood back up. It was a five-cent coin with a tiny colosseum pressed onto it.</p><p>She held it between her fore finger and thumb and remembered another time she held a coin like this. At night, just across the city, with Rio once again by her side.</p><p>She had made a wish then, one that had gotten her a gorgeous ring on her finger and an even more precious fiancée. And in that moment, the wish gave her what she needed once more.</p><p>Agatha reached out and took off Rio’s sunglasses before taking off her own. The sunlight was bright, but she wanted to look Rio in the eyes when she said this.</p><p>“I love you.”</p><p>There.</p><p>She said it.</p><p>“I love you,” she said again. “I’m so in love with you I end up doing stupid fucking things like chasing you to Italy and getting engaged after a few days. Still, I don’t regret any of it. I just regret being so stubborn that I couldn’t admit it sooner.”</p><p>Rio stared at her for a moment, and Agatha thought she’d somehow broken her. Then Rio dived in, kissing her fiercely, to the point Agatha could hardly breathe and she didn’t even care. She loved Rio and Rio loved her. That’s all that mattered.</p><p>When they pulled apart, Rio rested her forehead against hers. “I love you too.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha smirked. “But I love hearing you say it.”</p><p>Rio picked her up and spun her around. “I love you, I love you, I love you.”</p><p>Agatha squealed and held on tight. “Put me down!”</p><p>Rio obliged but was still grinning like an idiot. “Is it a coincidence you said this after we visited the Temple of Venus, or is there something to the Roman pantheon after all?”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You’re a dork.”</p><p>“Maybe, but you love me.”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha smiled, cupping her cheek. “More than anything.”</p><p>Rio smiled cheekily. “Even more than Emily Dickinson?”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes playfully. “Don’t push your luck, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio chuckled and kissed her deeply. “Wouldn’t dream of it, my love.”</p>

<p>As the plane began its decent into JFK, Agatha watched out of the window as the city came into view.</p><p>Rio had managed to get them first class seats on the right side of the plane and insisted she had the seat closest to the window. And so, Agatha had a fine view of the New York skyline, from the skyscrapers of Manhattan to the brown bricks of the boroughs.</p><p>“It’s so beautiful.”</p><p>“One of my favourites,” Rio admitted. “Even more so if it means I’m coming back to you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and reached for Rio’s hand, her engagement ring shimmering for all to see. She too knew this was more than just a homecoming. This was a beginning. The start of her life with Rio, and she couldn’t help but smile as they descended over Queens. Oh, how things had changed…</p><p>Soon the plane tires met the tarmac of the runway, and the plane braked to a steady stop. They were officially on US soil, back in the city where their story began. The vacation was over, and their new normality was about to begin.</p><p>Rio went into airport mode when they got into the terminal, using the perk of her status to fast-track through security, and ensured their luggage came round the conveyor first at baggage claim.</p><p>“I don’t like doing it,” Rio said guiltily, “but jetlag fucking sucks.”</p><p>Agatha had to agree, though she had managed to sleep for five hours of the flight. She had fallen asleep to the sound of Rio typing away on her laptop and woke up to her doing the same. She wished Rio would allow herself time to relax, but she knew she had an empire to run and it wasn’t like she’d never skipped a few hours’ sleep to get on top of marking and seminar planning.</p><p>Rio’s driver was waiting for them as they walked out of arrivals. He quickly took their cases and led them out to where the familiar SUV was parked. The sun was now beginning to set, and Agatha was grateful. By the time they made it back to Rio’s, it would be nightfall, and they could go straight to bed.</p><p>As her driver loaded their bags in the back, Rio opened the back passanger door and smiled. “After you, my love.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her on the cheek before climbing in, sliding across so Rio could get in to sit beside her. Soon their cases were shut away in the trunk, and Rio’s driver climbed into the front seat before starting up the engine and driving them out of the airport complex.</p><p>As they travelled through Queens, Rio yapped away with her driver while Agatha looked out of the window. She had travelled this route a number of times, either in taxis or in cars that were never her own. Though this time was another case of the latter, it was different from the other times.</p><p>As an adult, it was her returning from vacation or an academic trip back to her apartment, alone and deflated. When she was at university, it was visiting Lilia, and would often end in her persuading her godmother to go back to Europe as she hated everyone in that fucking city with a burning passion, and then there had been the times she sat silently beside her mother, who remained pleasant and polite in front of their driver and travelling companions, yet Little Agatha knew she’d be facing some kind of wrath as soon as they were home alone.</p><p>This time, she watched as the skyscrapers got closer and closer, and she was actually…happy. She was engaged, sat beside her fiancé, and she had a few more weeks until she was properly back to work. Most things were looking up, and those that weren’t, well, her and Rio would face them together.</p><p>As they got across Robert F Kennedy bridge into Manhattan, Agatha expected Rio’s driver to take the route towards the Upper-East or West Side, but instead he went another way. A route she quickly recognised.</p><p>“Why are we heading this way?”</p><p>Rio looked to her with a warm smile. “We’re going home.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “I thought we were staying together tonight?”</p><p>“We are.”</p><p>“Then why are we going to my place?”</p><p>It was now Rio’s turn to look confused. “I thought you’d want to stay there?”</p><p>“B-but don’t you want to see Victoria?”</p><p>“It’s late already. I’ll see her properly tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha bit her lip. It wasn’t that she didn’t want to go home, because she really fucking did. She missed her bed, her books, even the stuffed rabbit her godsons had picked out as a gift for her birthday. What she didn’t want, however, was Rio seeing her place.</p><p>Sure, Wanda had been checking on the place and getting her mail, and she had made sure it was clean and tidy before she left, but it was still, well, small. And she was pretty certain Rio’s place…wasn’t.</p><p>“Are you okay?” Rio asked and Agatha nodded, reaching to take her hand.</p><p>“I’m great. Just…don’t have any expectations, okay? It’s nice enough but compared to what you’re used to…”</p><p>“Are you calling me a snob?” Rio asked, and Agatha quickly shook her head.</p><p>“I know you’d never judge me, but I know you’re used to a certain standard…”</p><p>“My standard is waking up next to you,” Rio stated firmly. “I’ll love your place because it’s yours. You don’t have to worry.”</p><p>Agatha believed her, but it didn’t make her feel any better.</p><p>Soon they were pulling up outside their building, and Rio’s driver insisted on carrying their cases upstairs. Agatha knew it was an act of kindness, but she couldn’t help but wonder what her neighbours would think.</p><p>Rio said goodbye to her driver as Agatha unlocked her door. When she walked inside, she couldn’t help but smile at her little place. Her sanctuary. Her mind palace. A space that was totally hers, but she guessed that would change from now on.  </p><p>As she looked around the living area, she was relieved to see Wanda had left her a care package of essentials: snacks, some soda, bottled water, pods for her coffee machine, and a little note.</p><p align="center"><em>Got milk for you but don’t know if you’ll be here much so if you don’t see this until Thursday, DON’T DRINK IT.</em></p><p align="center"><em>The twins (and I) can’t wait to see you!</em></p><p>Agatha smiled to herself. She couldn’t wait to see them too, and she also couldn’t wait for Rio to meet the boys. Wanda she was a bit more apprehensive about. She was running through all the scenarios in which her best friend would try to embarrass her when she heard the apartment door shut.</p><p>She looked back to see Rio slowly walking around, taking in her surroundings. Agatha watched nervousness as her fiancée’s eyes travelled over every wall and surface. She knew it was cluttered, and not filled with fineries of the Lake Como villa, or the extravagant décor of Lilia’s townhouse. It was lived in, with too much stuff for such a small space for her thirty-five years of accumulating books and trinkets and art prints, probably the kind of place Rio had only seen on TV, a world away from five-star hotels and millionaire mansions.</p><p>“Well?” Agatha eventually asked. “What do you think?”</p><p>“I love it,” Rio grinned. “But I’d mostly love to see your bed.”</p><p>Agatha raised her eyebrows, and Rio quickly blushed.</p><p>“I mean to sleep. I’m really tired.”</p><p>Agatha walked over and hugged her from behind. “I know, my love. You should have slept on the plane.”</p><p>“I know, but it seemed like a good chance to get paperwork done,” Rio argued. “If you want to stay up, though, we can. I could probably last a few more hours.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “You need to sleep. Let’s move the cases into the bedroom. I think I have some fresh sleep clothes for you.”</p><p>Rio turned in her arms and placed a quick kiss to her lips. “You’re taking good care of me.”</p><p>“I’ve been your guest for plenty in the last few weeks,” Agatha argued. “It’s about time I repaid the favour”</p><p>She led Rio to the bedroom, and of course Rio gravitated to the damn plush rabbit. “This is cute.”</p><p>“The twins got me it for my birthday. They got it when they went to visit their grandparents in England. It’s one of those Jellycat things.”</p><p>Rio appraised the stuffed animal with a smile. “I’m looking forward to meeting them.”</p><p>“You are?”</p><p>“Of course. They’re your family.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but dive into Rio’s arms, kissing her deeply. “I love you.”</p><p>“And I love you,” Rio insisted. “So shall we get ready for bed?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, telling Rio to go in the bathroom first while she dug her out something to sleep in.</p><p>She found a t shirt and sleep shorts, and when Rio emerged from the bathroom, face bare of makeup and her teeth freshly brushed, she handed it to her with a coy smile.</p><p>“There you go, my love.”</p><p>Rio took in Agatha’s own oversized sleep shirt and bit her lip. “I could stay up a bit longer…you know, if you wanted?”</p><p>Oh, did Agatha want.</p><p>“Get ready and I’ll be back in a moment.”</p><p>Agatha rushed into the bathroom. She took off her make up and brushed her teeth, before fixing her hair to give it that sexy messy look she knew Rio would appreciate. Her fiancée loved her hair, along with everything else about her, and she fucking loved it.</p><p>With one last smirk in the mirror, she headed out ready to christen New York with her gorgeous fiancée, and Rio…</p><p>Rio was in bed, snoozing away.</p><p>After a moment of fleeting disappointment, she smiled lovingly at her sleeping form and crept over to the bed. She carefully climbed into bed and snuggled in. Rio instantly shifted closer, throwing an arm around Agatha before settling once more.</p><p>Agatha smiled and closed her eyes, sleep overtaking her soon enough.</p><p> </p><p>Rio woke up the next morning to the sound of car horns.</p><p>She blinked, taking in the unfamiliar surroundings. Agatha’s bedroom was small but comforting, her filled with cosy blankets while every surface was covered in at least one book. What she loved most, however, was the smell. Being wrapped up in those sheets was like she was wrapped completely in Agatha, and she couldn’t get enough of it. </p><p>Then there was the woman laid next to her, still fast asleep with her hair covering her face. Rio gently tucked the strands behind her ear, smiling as she studied the sleeping beauty beside her. </p><p>Sure, their vacation of a lifetime had come to an end, but Rio knew every day with Agatha would be the best of her life, even when they’re both slightly jet-lagged. </p><p>She rolled over and checked her phone. It was just past eight, a big lie-in for her, and she had a ridiculous amount of emails and messages. </p><p>She had a text from Carol asking when she was back in New York, another from Billy asking if she was going in the office today, and then one from Alice…</p><p><strong>ALICE</strong></p><p><em>Can we talk?</em></p><p>Rio frowned as she slid out of bed, walking through to the living area as she typed.</p><p><strong>RIO</strong></p><p><em>If you’re going to insult my fiancée again, no.</em></p><p>The reply came quickly.</p><p><strong>ALICE</strong></p><p><em>You can’t blame me for being concerned…</em></p><p>Rio sighed. She guessed she couldn’t. </p><p>She used some of the pods from the care package Agatha’s friend had left and set up the coffee machine. While it was brewing, she typed back her reply.</p><p><strong>RIO</strong></p><p><em>I just want you to respect my decision. If you can’t even do that, I see no way we can talk this out.</em></p><p>There.</p><p>That seemed pretty reasonable to her.</p><p>She made the first coffee then got started on the second, using the time as it brewed to peruse Agatha’s book collection. It was vast, mostly with titles she’d never heard of and plenty of Emily Dickinson. Okay, maybe she needed to at least attempt to read some of these, especially in anticipation of their promised fall trip to Amherst.</p><p>Yet there were some books that were unlike the others. She pulled out one such books to look at the cover, frowning as Moomintroll stared back at her. It was in its original Swedish (she knew that well enough after spending so much time with Hela) and was a reasonably new edition. Rio frowned. Agatha didn’t seem like a Moomins fan. In fact, she didn’t seem particularly attached to any of the characters. No merchandise, no clothes, and none of the other books from what she could see.</p><p>Curious, she opened the book and found a message on the first page.</p><p><em>Aggie,</em></p><p><em>Saw this and thought of you. Hope you haven’t missed me too much while I’m home in Moominvalley. </em></p><p><em>O x</em></p><p>Rio’s frown deepened.</p><p>Agatha had never mentioned any such ‘O’, and they seemed to at least have a playful closeness. A recent playful closeness if the age of the book had anything to do with it. Rio supposed this ‘O’ was a friend, but she wondered why Agatha had never mentioned them?</p><p>The coffee machine beeped signalling it was done, and she quickly set the book back on the shelf. She carried the coffee through and placed them on the bedside table before sliding back into bed with her sleepy fiancée. With a soft smile, she leaned down and showered her cheek with kisses.</p><p>Agatha grumbled and batted her away. “Rio, give me five more minutes.”</p><p>“Okay, but your coffee will get cold.”</p><p>An eye peaked open. “You made me coffee?”</p><p>“I did,” Rio confirmed. “But if you’re still sleepy…”</p><p>Agatha yawned and slowly sat herself up against the headboard. Rio shifted to do the same and passed over her mug before picking up her own.</p><p>“You worked out how to use the coffee machine then?” Agatha asked as she blew on her coffee.</p><p>“I hope so, otherwise this romantic gesture is going to fall flat real fast.” Rio took a sip of her slightly cooler coffee, and it tasted good enough.</p><p>“So what’s the plan for today?”</p><p>“Well, I need to see Victoria,” Rio answered. “Maybe you could come with me?”</p><p>“To your place?” Agatha grinned. “Oh, I can’t wait to see this.”</p><p>“Keep your expectations low,” Rio insisted. “It’s not very homely. Not like here.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Is that your way of saying my apartment is small?”</p><p>“No, I’m saying it’s personal,” Rio insisted. “Mine, well, isn’t.”</p><p>“Then maybe we can work on that?” Agatha suggested. “Since we’ll probably be living there soon.”</p><p>“You need to see the place first,” Rio argued. “You might hate it.”</p><p>“I might,” Agatha agreed. “We shall see about that later.”</p><p>Rio took another sip of her coffee. “Alice wants to talk to me.”</p><p>“She does?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I’ve told her if she can’t accept my decisions, there’s nothing to talk about. She hasn’t replied yet.”</p><p>“Rio, you don’t have to fall out with her. Just because she doesn’t like me…”</p><p>“It’s not that she doesn’t like you, it’s that she disrespected you, and me. I won’t stand for that.”</p><p>“But…”</p><p>“No Agatha,” Rio said firmly. “I won’t weaver on this. That is my ultimatum. She can either take it or leave it.”</p><p>Her fiancée just stared at her and for a moment Rio feared she had been a little too firm. Then Agatha leaned in and placed a firm kiss against her cheek, before her lips travelled to her ear.</p><p>“If it wasn’t for this coffee, I’d ride you so hard right now that we’d have to buy a new mattress.”</p><p>Rio almost spilt her own coffee down herself, but somehow managed to keep steady.</p><p>The moment was quickly interrupted by the chime of her phone, and as she read the message, she sighed.</p><p>“It seems the kids know I’m home.”</p><p>“The kids?” Agatha frowned, and Rio showed her the message.</p><p><strong>BILLY</strong></p><p><em>I have some papers for you to sign. Are you coming in the office or do I have to courier them? Your office is just how you left it, btw and Harper has some invoices for you to approve. </em></p><p>“It seems they do,” Agatha agreed.</p><p>“How about we get ready and get some brunch?” Rio suggested. “I can head to the office after.”</p><p>Agatha pouted. “So we’re not spending the day together?”</p><p>“Agatha, we’ve just spent the past two weeks together.”</p><p>Her eyebrows raised. “Oh, so you’re sick of me?”</p><p>“No!” Rio quickly insisted. “I just thought you might want to see your friends. It seems Wanda is eager to see you.”</p><p>“If you think I’m going to be allowed to see my friends without bringing you along, you’re very much mistaken.”</p><p>Rio chuckled. “Okay then, come to the office with me.”</p><p>“Really?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “We’re engaged. Its only right you get to know more about how the company works.”</p><p>“Alright then,” Agatha took a sip of her coffee. “And I’ll bring an overnight bag for tonight, but you better start clearing closet space, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I promise, Ms Harkness. Whatever you want is yours.”</p><p> </p><p>The offices for the Vidal Group were located on 6<sup>th</sup> Avenue in a glass high-rise. The company took up four floors in the upper half of the building, yet as soon as they walked into the lobby, Rio’s authority was quickly notable.</p><p>Agatha saw people look their way, some whispering to their companions while others stood to attention and offered Rio welcoming smiles. Of course Rio paid no mind to it, responding in kind to greetings on their way to the elevator.</p><p>Once the door shut, Agatha couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Rio quickly asked, and Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“Nothing, I just didn’t realise I was dating a celebrity.”</p><p>“I’m not a celebrity.”</p><p>“Maybe not outside, but in here it’s like I’m walking in with Tom Cruise.”</p><p>Rio grimaced. “Could you have picked anyone else?”</p><p>“Fine, Pedro Pascal?”</p><p>“Better.”</p><p>“My point still stands,” Agatha continued. “You seem to have a lot of respect around here.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t say that,” Rio countered. “They probably just want a raise, or their rent lowering.”</p><p>“Rent?”</p><p>“I part-own the building.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Of course you do.”</p><p>Soon they reached the floor for the Vidal Group, and as soon as the doors opened, Billy was practically dragging Rio out.</p><p>“Good to have you back, boss,” he said as he steered them through the floor of offices, his iPad tucked under his arm. “The place hasn’t been the same without you.”</p><p>To Agatha it looked very sleek, like a hip start-up but with a touch of finery. All the desks had the newest tech, and the paintings on the wall were abstract and likely each worth more than her yearly wage.</p><p>“It’s good to be back,” Rio said as she greeted her workers with smiles and cute waves. “Have you been holding the fort while I’ve been gone?”</p><p>“Yes, and Harper has been a big help,” Billy replied. “How was your vacation?”</p><p>Rio looked to Agatha and smiled. “It was fantastic.”</p><p>Once they were in her office, Rio instructed Billy to sit, while she pulled a chair to her side of the desk for Agatha.</p><p>Agatha sat down beside her fiancée, taking in the room. It was a corner office, with a great view out onto the surrounding city scape. The leather couch was angled to the best view looking down 6<sup>th</sup> Street, while her desk overlooked the sidewalk below. On the two walls were more expensive art, but her desk was more personal. On it was a Lego plant, a little grumpy-looking figure in a New York Liberty jersey, and couple of photographs. One was of Rio and her parents when she was very young, her front two teeth missing from her smile, though Agatha knew that adorable gap was making way. The other was of Rio and Alice at some kind of dinner. They were both laughing, content in each other’s company.</p><p>Agatha felt a jab of guilt, but it quickly disappeared when Rio took her hand.</p><p>“Billy, we have some news,” she began. “Agatha and I are engaged.”</p><p>His eyes widened in surprise, before he smiled brightly. “Really? Can I see the ring? Tell me everything!”</p><p>They told Billy the story (well the PG version), and he had plenty of questions as it went along. Still, it was refreshing to have someone be actually happy for them rather than questioning their sanity, and after the story was done and his questions were answered, the kid beamed brightly.</p><p>“So is Agatha my boss now too?”</p><p>Agatha looked to Rio, who shrugged. “Not legally yet, but I think we need to go over some new protocol. Of course Agatha needs to have full access to the floors, as well as my private residences. My driver should be at her disposal, and I want it made clear to everyone here that Agatha deserves their upmost respect.”</p><p>Billy nodded in understanding as he noted it down on his iPad. “Right, is there anything else?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio replied, before clearing her throat. “Honey.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened at the name.</p><p>“The new girl? The one who’s starting next month?”</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek. That was way too soon.</p><p>“Yes. I need to make sure she’s kept busy and preferably out of my way. She’s good at her job, but she has edged towards crossing the line a few times and I don’t want that to continue.”</p><p>Edging towards the line? Agatha wanted to laugh. That girl was so far over the line she’d need directions to get back.</p><p> “I’ll make sure of it,” Billy assured, before getting to his feet. “The paperwork I need you to sign is on the desk. It won’t take long I promise.”</p><p>Once he was gone, Rio picked up a pen and began reading through the first document. Agatha watched her for a while before deciding to speak up.</p><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>Rio looked to her with a frown. “For what?”</p><p>“This. Making me feel welcome, and for setting that boundary with Honey.”</p><p>“You don’t need to thank me, my love,” Rio assured, but Agatha shook her head.</p><p>“No, you really go above and beyond for me, Rio. Just so you know, I am grateful for everything, even if I don’t always show it.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly at her words. “Let me sign these and we can get out of here.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, before her gaze drifted out of the window, where it remained until Rio said she was done, and called to request for her driver to meet them out front.</p><p>It turned out, of course, that Rio had a huge penthouse overlooking Central Park West. Agatha reckoned she could fit her whole apartment in the living area alone about three times, and that was only a fraction of the space. There was a separate kitchen, a dining room, an office, a gym, and several bedrooms. It was like a suburban house in a high-rise, with a stunning view right across central park and beyond.</p><p>Yet it wasn’t…well, Rio. There was nothing personal besides a few photographs, and if Agatha didn’t know any better, she’d think it was the world’s biggest hotel room.</p><p>Yet there was something very personal there, and after Rio put her suitcase in the master bedroom and led Rio through to one of the spare rooms. One with only a small window, tinted to let in the most minimal light. In the corner of the room was a large glass box, a thick layer of dirt covering the bottom half with plants and driftwood cover sitting on top.</p><p>Agatha knew what it was instantly.</p><p>She was about to meet Victoria.</p><p>“Come on,” Rio encouraged. “She doesn’t bite.”</p><p>“She’s a tarantula,” Agatha reminded her. “Of course she bites.”</p><p>Rio stepped up to the terrarium and lifted the lid. She carefully stuck her hand inside and Agatha stepped back as she saw something crawl into the waiting palm. Her fiancée slowly lifted her hand out and turned to Agatha, staring at the arachnid with a loving gaze.</p><p>“Victoria, this is Agatha. Agatha, this is my baby girl, Victoria.”</p><p>Agatha stood awkwardly. She hated spiders, but she knew Rio loved Victoria, and she loved Rio, so she took a cautious step forward.</p><p>“She isn’t going to jump at me, is she?”</p><p>“No,” Rio assured. “She’s very docile.”</p><p>Agatha eyed the arachnid, taking in it’s fuzzy appearance. “I guess compared to the spiders I encounter in my apartment, she’s very cute.”</p><p>“Maybe one day you’ll want to hold her.”</p><p>“Maybe.” Agatha watched as Rio gently put Victoria back, and it was then she remembered what she had missed out on last night and had to postpone that morning. Once Victoria was happily nestled under a piece of driftwood, and Rio had placed the lid back on the terrarium, she stepped up and whispered in her ear. “Go wash your hands and meet me in the bedroom.</p><p>Rio didn’t need telling twice and raced off in the direction of the main bathroom. Agatha, however, headed straight to the master bedroom. It was once again an impersonal space, but Agatha didn’t mind. That would be a bridge they’d cross another day. In that moment, she had something more important on her mind.</p><p>Agatha threw open Rio’s suitcase and dug through it until she found what she was looking for. She headed to the adjoining bathroom and washed the toy and tried it up, before returning through to find Rio sat on the bed. She threw the harness and dildo into her lap. “Get it on.”</p><p>Rio scrambled to strip and Agatha did the same. She was not in the mood for waiting.</p><p>Once they were both undressed (with one of them strapped up), Agatha pushed Rio down onto the bed. “I think we ran out of lube, so I’ll have to improvise.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to question what she meant, but Agatha didn’t give her chance to answer. She climbed halfway up her body and after a deep breath, she leaned down and took the shaft into her mouth. Just the tip at first, before working her way further, until her lips were almost meeting the base.</p><p>She stole a glance up and found Rio staring back at her, her chest heaving with heavy breaths.  That only made her work harder, until she could hear her fiancée groan loudly. “Fuck, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her mouth up and smiled breathlessly. “You ready for me, baby?”</p><p>Rio nodded eagerly, and Agatha didn’t waste a moment. She moved to straddle Rio’s hips and once positioned, she slid down onto the shaft, letting out a wanton moan. She’d never get tired of this.</p><p>Once she was fully seated, she leaned down to drape herself over Rio, placing a gentle kiss against her lips before beginning to grind her hips.</p><p>Rio’s hands flew up to grasp her thighs, and Agatha knew the base of the dildo was creating the perfect friction. With a smirk, she sat up, running her hands through her hair and pushing her chest forward, watching as Rio bit her lips as her eyes turned impossibly dark.</p><p>Agatha wasted no more time.</p><p>She rode Rio, and she rode her <em>hard</em>.</p><p>The large headboard banded against the wall in time with the wet slap of their thighs and their chorus of moans. It was perfect, hot and frantic but also trusting and intimate. Enough for her to let loose.</p><p>Neither of them lasted long. Rio came first, letting out a groan before thrusting her hips off the bed, somehow hitting a spot inside that made Agatha break in an instant.</p><p>After she rode the heavy waves, Agatha rolled off Rio and collapsed on the bed beside her.</p><p>“That was good.”</p><p>“It was,” Rio agreed. “How are we meant to carry on with our day now?”</p><p>“Carry on? Oh no. We have catching up to do.”</p><p>Rio turned on her side, propping her head up. “We do?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “We usually go about three rounds a night, so we need two more to make up for last night.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Alright, are we in any more debt?”</p><p>Agatha thought. “There was the night we had that argument, so that’s another three. Then there’s all that time between our first kiss and our first time, and we have our three for today. We have a lot of work to do.”</p><p>Rio chuckled and climbed over her. “We best started then.”</p><p>Agatha smiled before giving in to Rio’s passionate kisses. If this was what rest of her life would be like, she’d take it gladly.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The last week of Agatha’s leave had been wonderful. She’d spent so much time with Rio, jumping between their apartments, going for walks, watching movies, visiting Rio’s office. They even went to a basketball game, which Agatha surprisingly enjoyed.</p><p>Oh, and they had sex.</p><p>Lots and lots of sex.</p><p>Yet the day eventually came when Agatha had to return to work, starting with a day of department and faculty meetings that would likely make her want to tear her hair out. And of course, it would mean being away from her fiancée, which seemed like a nightmare in itself.</p><p>It also didn’t help that Rio had distracted her for most of her break and she had done zero research.</p><p>“It’ll be fine,” Rio assured her as she sat cross-legged on Agatha’s bed. “You have all that research you did before our vacation. You’re allowed a personal life.”</p><p>“My job is to research, Rio,” Agatha said as she shrugged on her blazer, assessing her appearance in the mirror. “Teaching is just what keeps the doors open.”</p><p>“And you have researched, babe. Maybe not as much as you usually do, but this summer will just have to be an exception.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “It certainly was.”</p><p>Rio shifted to the end of the bed. “I’m sorry I distracted you, though.”</p><p>“We distracted each other,” Agatha reminded her as she moved to stand between her thighs, her hands resting on her shoulders. “I’m going to miss you so much today.”</p><p>Deep brown eyes stared back at her. “It’ll be fine,” she repeated. “It’ll be done before you know it.”</p><p>Agatha leaned down and kissed her. In that moment, she almost believed Rio’s words.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>In her heart she knew it would be a long day.</p><p>Rio and her driver dropped her off at campus. There was a strange sense of uncanniness returning after the break. Like she’d lived a lifetime since she left a matter of weeks ago. She’d left angry, pining and terminally single. She returned happy, openly in love, and engaged to the most amazing woman in the world. And somehow it was her old life that didn’t feel real.</p><p>“Call me when you’re done,” Rio insisted. “I’ll come pick you up.”</p><p>“I could come to you,” Agatha suggested. “I know you’re busy.”</p><p>“I’m never busy for you,” Rio promised. “I love you.”</p><p>“I love you too.” Agatha kissed her softly and was quickly overwhelmed with the realization this would be the first time they’d really be apart since taking that big step. She pulled away and opened the car door, climbing out before looking back at her gorgeous fiancée. “I’ll see you later.”</p><p>“I already can’t wait,” Rio grinned and Agatha relished that sight before closing the door and walking away, desperately trying to keep it together.</p><p>As she approached the arts faculty building, she tried to reason with herself. She couldn’t be with Rio all the time. There would be times when she wouldn’t see her all day, or at all. There would even be times they weren’t even on the same continent, and that <em>had</em> been the case not too long ago. Yet it was different now. She was ridiculously in love and there was nothing she wanted more than being with her future wife. Oh, how would she survive without seeing Rio’s face constantly? Or hearing her voice? Or be able to touch her?</p><p>She was so wrapped up in her thoughts that she didn’t notice someone in her path until she bumped straight into them.</p><p>“Sorry, I…”</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha tensed. She knew that voice all too well. That English accent with that underlying Swedish twang. A voice she’d become so used to hearing, only for it to completely disappear for sixteen months.</p><p>She looked back and sure enough, there she was. Her hair was shorter, and streaked with bleach blonde highlights, but it was her. Down to the oversized jacket and the vape in her hand.</p><p>“Olivia? You’re back?”</p><p>“I am.” Olivia made a joke of presenting herself. “Fresh from the motherland.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed sharply. “Was it a productive trip?”</p><p>She shrugged. “Same old, same old.”</p><p>“And you’re back for the school year?”</p><p>“Yep.” Olivia took another drag of her vape before shoving it in her pocket. “I hear congratulations are in order?”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “How did you…”</p><p>“Like anything is a secret round here.”</p><p>Agatha blushed and pushed her hair out of her face. She was still getting used to the whole being engaged thing, especially being engaged to one of the richest people in the world.</p><p>Olivia whistled. “Look at that rock!”</p><p>Agatha’s blush deepened but she held her hand out so Olivia could get a better look. “Beautiful right?”</p><p>“She did a good job.” Olivia took her hand and admired it closely. “What stone is it?”</p><p>“Lilac sapphire” Agatha answered. “It’s vintage. Rio saw it in Rome and knew it was the one.”</p><p>“She knows you well.”</p><p>“She does,” Agatha confirmed. “So, Olivia, I…”</p><p>“I got you an engagement present.” Olivia fished in her pocket. “There wasn’t much choice in the airport, so I got creative.”</p><p>Agatha took the small paper bag and opened it up, finding two moomin keyrings.  Both the same. Both of Moomintroll hugging Snorkmaiden. Both adorable.</p><p>“Thank you. This is really nice of you.”</p><p>Olivia shrugged it off. “We’re friends, right? This is what friends do.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Yes, you’re right.”</p><p>“Always am.” Olivia smirked before nodding to the building. “Shall we head in?”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha walked beside her, watching Olivia closely as she took a final drag from her vape. “I thought you were quitting?”</p><p>Olivia laughed. “Old habits die hard.”</p><p>They entered the auditorium; all the arts faculties crowded into the space. Olivia said a quick goodbye before going to join the history and politics department. Agatha watched her receive her hero’s welcome before making her way to were Wanda and Kingo were chatting towards the back.</p><p>When he saw her, Kingo jumped out of his seat.</p><p>“Mrs Vidal in the building!”</p><p>“Who says I’m taking her last name?” Agatha argued, but her friends just laughed.</p><p>Wanda stood and gave her a hug. “It’s good to see you, though I was hoping to see you sooner. Your godsons are getting restless.”</p><p>“I’ll see them soon,” Agatha promised. “I’ve been a little, erm, busy.”</p><p>Kingo whistled. “Tell us everything!”</p><p>Wanda elbowed him in the side. “Enough of that. Now let me see that ring!”</p><p>Agatha held up her left hand, beaming with pride. She would never get tired of this.</p><p> </p><p>Rio sat in her office, trying to read through the latest report on the progress for Rome. Honey had sent it over so it would be there when she woke up. She could hear Agatha’s voice in her head stating she was making an effort to make herself seem helpful, which was likely true. Still, she decided to ignore it, and thanked Honey for completing it and told her she would report back with a review.</p><p>Or she would if she could concentrate, which seemed like a big ask considering she’d read the same sentence five times.</p><p>She missed Agatha.</p><p>It was stupid, really. They needed time apart. To work, to socialize, to have their own time. Still, she wasn’t used to it and so far, she hated it.</p><p>A knock on her door broke her out of her misery, and she smiled as Billy walked in, iPad in hand.</p><p>“Hey Billy, what’s up?”</p><p>“The front desk called up. You have a walk-in.”</p><p>“A walk-in?” Rio frowned. “Who?”</p><p>“She said she knows you.” Billy checked his iPad. “A Ms Jennifer Kale?”</p><p>Rio’s eyebrows raised. “Really? Send her up.”</p><p>“So you do know her?”</p><p>“She’s a friend,” Rio assured, before wondering. “Is she alone?”</p><p>“Seems so.” Billy stepped back towards the door. “I’ll greet her at the elevator.”</p><p>Rio gave him a grateful smile to hide her disappointment. For a second she had hoped Alice was with her. That she had brought Jen along for support so she could apologize.</p><p>She loved Agatha and she’d always stand by her. She would never stand to anyone putting her down or fuelling cruel gossip. Still, she missed her best friend. She missed able to call her. She missed her laughter and her council. She missed Alice Wu Gulliver so much it made her sick, but she was also infuriated by what she said. How quickly she was to think the worst of the woman she loved, and how she hadn’t trusted her judgement, instead choosing to listen to rumours from a girl she barely knew.</p><p>Yet she knew that if Alice apologised, she’d forgive her in a heartbeat.</p><p>The door to her office opened once more, and Jen stepped inside, dressed in a hot pink pantsuit. Rio got up and greeted her with a hug.</p><p>“It’s good to see you. How long have you been back?”</p><p>“Just under a week,” Jen admitted. “Lilia and I didn’t want to bother you and Agatha. We knew you’d both be, erm, acclimatising.”</p><p>Rio chuckled as she moved to sit back at her desk. “Can I get you anything? Water? Tea? Coffee? Snacks?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Jen assured as she sat opposite her. “As you’ve probably guessed, this isn’t just a social call.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “And since you came to speak to me here on the exact day Agatha went back to work, I’m guessing this is about Alice.”</p><p>Jen laughed. “You don’t miss a trick do you.”</p><p>“Nope. So, what’s up? Is Alice okay?”</p><p>“She’s fine,” Jen assured. “We’re…we’re talking again.”</p><p>“Right…”</p><p>“I called her to give her shit for what she said about Agatha. I told her it wasn’t true and she did listen. Then we just started catching up and…we’re not together again. We’ve only slept together once since.”</p><p>Rio grimaced. “Okay…”</p><p>“And she hasn’t totally changed her mind on Agatha, but she can see why Ellie Bishop’s spawn isn’t exactly a reliable source.”</p><p>“She should have known that straight away,” Rio countered and Jen held up her hands.</p><p>“Hey, I agree but I can’t stay mad at her forever, and I know you can’t either.”</p><p>Rio looked down. Jen was right on the money there. “I want to, but I can’t condone someone believing those things about the love of my life. Alice knows I’ve waited my whole life to find her, and she’s betraying her the minute she gets the chance.”</p><p>“This has never been about Agatha,” Jen argued. “Not really. She loves you and she’s…she doesn’t want you to get hurt. Look, I know Bishop is full of shit and Alice went about things the wrong way, but her intention was never to hurt Agatha. It was to look out for you.”</p><p>Though Rio remained sceptical, she couldn’t deny Alice’s motives. Even in the wrong, her actions hadn’t been about hating Agatha. It had been out of concern and out of love.</p><p>“So what do you suggest?”</p><p>“I want to invite you and Agatha over to my place for dinner. Alice has already agreed to come, so it would be a good chance for you al to talk. I’ll play mediator, of course.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “Sure you won’t be unbiased, ref?”</p><p>Jen laughed. “Please. I call bullshit when I see it, regardless of who’s spewing it.”</p><p>Rio gasped. “Ms Kale, I thought you were prim and proper!”</p><p> Jen rolled her eyes. “You’ve been spending too much time with Agatha. So, I’ll be expecting you both about seven?”</p><p>“I hope so,” Rio answered. “I need to check with Agatha first. She’s the boss.”</p><p>Jen laughed again. “Rio, if you ask she’ll do it. The only person I’ve seen more down bad than you is her.”</p><p>Rio frowned as Jen left, momentarily confused by her words. She soon snapped out of it, though, and reached for her phone.</p><p><strong>RIO</strong></p><p><em>are you free to talk?</em></p><p>Agatha replied quickly.</p><p><strong>AGATHA</strong></p><p><em>Just left for a break. Why? What’s wrong?</em></p><p>Rio called her, and Agatha answered</p><p><em>“Rio? Are you okay? What’s happened?”</em></p><p>“Nothing bad,” Rio assured. “Jen’s just stopped by. She’s asked if we’ll go to her place tonight.”</p><p><em>“Tonight?”</em> The displeasure was clear in Agatha’s voice. <em>“Can’t we do it tomorrow? I’ve missed you all day. I just want to be back in our bubble.”</em></p><p>Rio understood her pain, but she knew this was important. “Jen’s got Alice to meet with us. We’re going to talk this out face to face.”</p><p>There was a long silence, and Rio worried. Then, she heard a defeated sigh.</p><p><em>“Alright, but tomorrow night you’re all mine.”</em></p><p>Rio smiled. “I’m always all yours, my love. Always have been, always will be.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled to herself as she rejoined Wanda and Kingo at their table. Wanda noticed her first and smirked. “Was that Rio?”</p><p>“It was,” Agatha confirmed. “We have last-minute dinner plans.”</p><p>“Oh to be a millionaire,” Kingo said with a dreamy sigh. “Where are you going? Per Se? Gramercy Tavern?”</p><p>“Our friend’s dining room,” Agatha corrected. “There’s been a bit of a falling out between Rio and her best friend, so we’re going to all sit down and talk.”</p><p>“Really? What about?”</p><p>“Me.”</p><p>Both their eyes widened.</p><p>“Wait, her best friend doesn’t like you?” Wanda questioned and Agatha shrugged.</p><p>“She believes some things she’s heard. I’m not overly concerned.”</p><p>“Well, you should be,” Kingo countered. “If she doesn’t like you, you’re screwed.”</p><p>“What?” Agatha frowned. “No, I’m not. Rio has told her what’s what.”</p><p>“Trust me, Agatha. If you lose the best friend, you lose the relationship.”</p><p>Wanda swatted his arm. “Don’t say stuff like that!”</p><p>“It’s true!”</p><p>“It isn’t!”</p><p>Kingo held up his hands and got to his feet. “Fine, but don’t say I didn’t warn you!”</p><p>Agatha watched him go and huffed. “He has no clue what he’s talking about.”</p><p>“What else is new,” Wanda joked, before her expression turned serious. “But I would try settle things.”</p><p>“You just said…”</p><p>“I know but think of Rio. This must be hard for her.”</p><p>Agatha bowed her head. “It is.”</p><p>“Just make sure tonight goes well,” Wanda insisted. “It’ll save all of you the heartache.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, then looked past her to see Olivia walking in with her department. She caught her eye and waved, before sitting down on the other side of the room.</p><p>Wanda looked over her shoulder and spotted Olivia immediately. “And what’s the deal with that?”</p><p>“With what?”</p><p>Wanda pursed her lips. “This is me you’re talking to. I saw you both walking in together this morning. What’s going on?”</p><p>Agatha shrugged. “Olivia and I are fine. She knows about Rio. She even got us an engagement gift.”</p><p>“Really?” Wanda raised her eyebrows. “What was it?”</p><p>“Matching Moomin keychains.”</p><p>“Moomins?” Wanda stared at her disbelief. “You can’t be serious.”</p><p>“What’s wrong with the Moomins?”</p><p>“She got you a Moomin book last time she went away and you had it on your bedside table for six months.”</p><p>“Because I never got round to reading it,” Agatha lied. “Look, it’s fine. Olivia was…she was fun. Rio is so much more than that. The two don’t even compare.”</p><p>Wanda stared at her for a moment before relenting. “Fine, but don’t mess this up for yourself, Agatha.”</p><p>“I won’t,” she insisted. “This is different, Wanda. I can’t describe it. The way Rio makes me feel is unlike anything I’ve every experienced. Like right now pretty much all I care about it getting back to her. Being away from her hurts. Like physically hurts. So if you have any more comments…”</p><p>Wanda held up her hands. “Okay, okay, I get it.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha huffed. “I’m sick of having to defend my relationship at every turn. Rio isn’t the only one invested, you know.”</p><p>Wanda gave her a fond smile. “I’m glad you finally have someone to fight for rather than against.”</p><p>“I’d defend my godsons until my dying breath,” Agatha reminded her, and Wanda laughed.</p><p>“Oh I have no doubt.”</p><p>Once all their meetings were finally done, Agatha called Rio and soon enough her fiancée’s car was waiting in the exact spot it had dropped her off.</p><p>Rio practically leaped out of the car, engulfing her in a hug. “I missed you so much!”</p><p>“Me too.” Agatha kissed her deeply. “Home? We could squeeze in some alone time before we have to get ready for dinner.”</p><p>Rio grinned and helped her into the car. “My darling, your wish is my command.”</p><p> </p><p>After spending two hours wrapped up in bed sheets (and themselves), Rio reluctantly buttoned up her dress shirt and looked at herself in Agatha’s mirror. She loved wearing suits. They made her feel powerful, invincible, and she looked pretty damn hot too.</p><p>The bathroom door opened and Agatha wandered out in a simple black dress and light make up. Absolutely perfect and absolutely gorgeous. Rio couldn’t help but stare.</p><p>“You look unreal.”</p><p>“Why thank you, my love.” Agatha kissed her cheek. “You look handsome.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio gave her a quick peck on the cheek. “You ready?”</p><p>“Whenever you are.”</p><p>Rio finished up her hair and sprayed on some cologne. Even though it was just a dinner between friends, she wanted to look good for Agatha. As every dinner, no matter how casual, was a date in her eyes.</p><p>When she was done, she turned to Agatha and smiled. “All done.”</p><p>“Perfect, my love.” Agatha went to reach for her small clutch, before her hand instead grasped her discarded work bag. “Hey, I have something for you.”</p><p>“You do?” Rio watched as Agatha rummaged through the bag before pulling out a small paper bag. She reached into it and retrieved something that gleamed silver. “My friend at work got us matching keychains.”</p><p>“Oh, that’s sweet.” Rio took the keychain with a smile, only for it to falter. “Moomins?”</p><p>“Yeah, she was in Sweden. She picked them up at the airport.”</p><p>Rio turned it over in her palm. “Do you like the Moomins?”</p><p>“Not particularly,” Agatha admitted. “They’re cute though, right?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Very.”</p><p>“I was thinking maybe you could put these on them.” Agatha rummaged through her bedside cabinet before pulling out a single set of keys. “Seeing as we’re spending a lot of our time here at the moment, which I don’t quite understand when you have a huge penthouse empty across town.”</p><p>“I still go to see Victoria,” Rio argued, but accepted the keys like they were priceless treasure. “You know, that corner of your living room would be perfect for a...”</p><p>“Victoria is coming nowhere near this apartment,” Agatha said firmly. “Now get that blazer on, Vidal. We have a dinner to get to.”</p><p>Rio shrugged on her jacket before taking another look at the fresh keychain in her hand. She decided it was best not to think too much into it and shoved it in her pocket before following Agatha out of the apartment.</p><p>After all, she had a friendship to salvage.</p>

<p>Agatha rang the doorbell for Jen’s penthouse, hearing the sound echo within.</p><p>She turned back to look at her fiancée, who stood quietly behind her with her arms crossed. “This is going to be chaos, you know that right?”</p><p>“I know,” Rio replied. “But I guess it’s necessary.”</p><p>The door opened to reveal Lilia in a bejewelled gown. Agatha knew her godmother never gave up the chance to get dressed up, and it seemed that night was no exception.</p><p>“Ah, here you both are! Jen’s been waiting!”</p><p>“Want are you doing here?” Agatha questioned.</p><p>“Jen called me and I couldn’t resist!” Lilia admitted, before looking past her to Rio. “And don’t you worry. Alice invited one of your friends to balance it out.”</p><p>Agatha saw Rio’s eyes widen. “Wait, which friend?”</p><p>They headed inside and sure enough, Lilia had perched herself in the main armchair, a glass of wine in her hand. Alice stood by the window with her back to them, looking out of the window across the city, and beside her stood a blonde woman dressed in cargos and a cropped white vest.</p><p>She looked over and grinned. “Rio Vidal!”</p><p>Agatha heard Rio sigh. “I should have known.”</p><p>The woman moved over and pulled Rio into a hug, picking her up off the ground. “I’ve missed you!”</p><p>“I missed you too, now put me down!”</p><p>The woman put Rio back on her feet. “Sorry, but it’s been so long. And now you’re fucking engaged!”</p><p>“Yes, no thanks to you,” Rio sassed, before looking to Agatha. “Babe, this is Carol.”</p><p>Carol. Agatha thought for a minute before it clicked.</p><p>She folded her arms. “So this is the genius who told you to buy me Cartier?”</p><p>“I didn’t specifically say Cartier, but I suppose I’m still guilty,” Carol admitted, but grinned anyway. She shook Agatha’s hand before frowning. “Are you a member at Soho House?”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Huh.” Carol tilted her head. “I’m sure I recognize you from somewhere.”</p><p>“I sent you our engagement pictures, dumbass,” Rio joked and Carol shrugged it off.</p><p>“Well, it’s nice to meet you finally.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, relieved that at least one of Rio’s friends was being nice to her.</p><p>Alice hadn’t turned to look at them, and Agatha watched as Jen stormed over to her. A few raised whispers were exchanged, before Alice huffed and finally faced the group. She gave them a weary look before moving to sit near Lilia, avoiding all their gazes.</p><p>“Right, dinner won’t be much longer,” Jen assured. “Does anyone want any wine?”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “I’d like a bucket full.”</p><p>She followed Jen through to the kitchen, and as soon as the door shut behind them, Agatha sighed.</p><p>“This is already unbearable.”</p><p>“It’ll be fine,” Jen assured. “Once we’re sat down for dinner, we’ll be able to talk this out.”</p><p>“And if we can’t?”</p><p>Jen didn’t respond. She opened a cupboard and pulled out a large wine glass. “This bucket enough for you?”</p><p>Agatha took it gladly. “Thanks.”</p><p>“Just let them hash it out,” Jen encouraged. “And try not to antagonize anyone.”</p><p>“Why would I…” Jen gave her a pointed look, and Agatha held up her hands. “Fine I’ll be on my best behaviour.”</p><p>Jen poured her some wine. “I need to finish dinner. You can either help me or go back out there.”</p><p>Agatha elected to leave and headed back into the lion’s den.</p><p>Rio had sat down on the couch, talking to Lilia and Carol. Alice had also sat down beside Carol, her eyes following Agatha as she moved to sit with her fiancée. The moment she sat down, Rio put her arm around her and kissed the side of her head.</p><p>“Everything okay, my love?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Jen is just finishing up dinner.”</p><p>“And I see you’ve got your wine.” Rio nodded to the large glass with an amused smirk.</p><p>“I did,” Agatha replied. “Think I’m going to need it.”</p><p>“You know, Agatha,” Carol spoke up. “I swear I know you from somewhere.”</p><p>“Perhaps you’ve seen each other at a function?” Lilia suggested. “My goddaughter usually makes quite the impression.”</p><p>Agatha shot her godmother a warning look.</p><p>“She did with me,” Rio said with a foolish grin. “The moment I saw her, she became the centre of my world.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and reached for her hand, giving it a gentle squeeze. “You made quite the impression on me too, my love.”</p><p>Carol laughed. “Yeah, you were wondering ‘who’s this loser?’”</p><p>“Shut up, Danvers,” Rio huffed. “Let us have our moment.”</p><p>Carol rolled her eyes. “Fine. I’ll save it for the wedding.”</p><p>Alice clicked her tongue, and when Agatha met her gaze, she was met with a sharp glare.</p><p>Agatha sighed. This was going to be a long night.</p><p> </p><p>Jen had put a patisserie board together for their first course, and Lilia and Carol had tucked in eagerly. </p><p>“This reminds me of a little restaurant tucked away near my favourite ski resort in the French alps,” Lilia commented. “It’s divine.”</p><p>“You ski?” Carol questioned, and Lilia laughed. </p><p>“No but I enjoy the lodge.”</p><p>“Sometimes a bit too much,” Agatha commented.</p><p>“And do you ski?” Carol asked. </p><p>Agatha shook her head. “I have before, but not for a while.”</p><p>“Then we should go!” Carol declared. “All of us. It’ll be fun!”</p><p>“Yeah,” Alice mumbled. “So much fun.”</p><p>Rio gave her a warning look, but Alice just shrugged in response. </p><p>Jen got to her feet. “Well, is everyone ready for the first course?”</p><p>“Oh yes,” Lilia replied. “It smells divine.”</p><p>Jen left the table, which fell into an uncomfortable silence. Rio stole a glance at Alice. Their eyes met for an instant, before her once closest friend quickly looked away. </p><p>Her heart hurt. Rio had dreamed of this for so long. To have her friends and the love of her life around her, enjoying an evening all together. Only this had become more of a nightmare. </p><p>Jen brought out a vegetarian ragu that was beyond divine. It was as they tucked in that their host then kicked started the purpose of their gathering. </p><p>“Right, let’s begin by sharing our feelings on the engagement. I for one am happy for my friends.”</p><p>“Me too,” Carol added with a wink. “Been a long time coming.”</p><p>“And I’m happy that my goddaughter has found someone who clearly adores her.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “I don’t think adore even covers it.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, a blush pinking her cheeks. </p><p>“Alice?” Jen questioned. “Your thoughts?”</p><p>Alice looked down at her plate, pushing her food with her folk. </p><p>Jen cleared her throat, and Alice reluctantly looked up. “I-I’m happy Rio is happy.”</p><p>Well, that was something, right?</p><p>“Care to add anything else?” Jen pressed. </p><p>Alice remained silent for a moment before putting down her folk. “Look, I know I’m being seen as the bad guy here, but you need to see this from my point of view.”</p><p>Rio saw Agatha fold her arms. “And what view is that?”</p><p>Alice shot Agatha a glare. “That this is all very suspicious.”</p><p>“Suspicious?” Rio questioned. “What? Because you heard some stupid rumour?”</p><p>“No. It’s because <em>this</em> is all very convenient.”</p><p>“Convenient? What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>“That she had no interest in you until you whisked her off to Rome and showed her around your lakeside villa. Then within a couple of weeks you’re fucking <em>engaged?!</em> Do you realize how that looks?”</p><p>“It’s not like that,” Rio insisted. “Agatha doesn’t like my money.”</p><p>Alice scoffed. “Oh please.”</p><p>“I don’t!” Agatha snapped, but even Carol looked dubious. </p><p>“There’s no shame in enjoying it,” she assured. “As long as it’s not the reason you’re together.”</p><p>Rio barely had time to consider Carol’s point before Agatha shot it down. </p><p>“I don’t want her money. In fact, her money is why it took so long for this to happen. I’ve had that kind of money, and I was more miserable with it than without it.” </p><p>“I find that hard to believe,” Alice countered, and Rio could see Carol also remained unconvinced. Her, Jen and Lilia knew Agatha’s truth, and if they knew too, this would be no question.</p><p>“It’s the truth,” Agatha insisted. “I don’t want to be in this world again, and luckily your gossiping friends have proven exactly why. Annoyingly, I can be happy without the money, but now I can’t be happy without Rio. It took me a while to accept my feelings, but now I have, I have accepted that I can’t have it both ways. Rio is worth all of this, but she doesn’t deserve her best friend being a bitch about it.”</p><p>“I’m protecting her!” Alice snapped back. </p><p>“She doesn’t need protecting from me! I love her!”</p><p>Alice folded her arms. “Alright then. Look me in the eye and tell me you didn’t kill your mother.”</p><p>Rio felt Agatha tense, and she quickly reached for her hand. </p><p>“She didn’t,” Lilia insisted. “You have no idea what happened. None of you do.”</p><p>“Then explain it to me,” Alice countered. “Tell me the ‘truth’.”</p><p>Silence fell across the room, eyes shifting between each other sheepishly. Until eventually Agatha cleared her throat sharply. </p><p>“My mother fell down the stairs. The paramedics couldn’t do anything.”</p><p>“So she fell?”</p><p>“More like tumbled,” Agatha countered. “The stairs were marble. Very impractical.”</p><p>Alice stared at her in disbelief. “She died because the stairs were <em>impractical</em>. What the fuck is wrong with you?!”</p><p>“What do you want me to do? Cry?”</p><p>“I’d expect you not to joke about it.”</p><p>“Well sorry to disappoint.”</p><p>Rio put her head in her hands. This was a nightmare.</p><p>“Alice,” Jen spoke up. “Agatha doesn’t always express her emotions…”</p><p>“I don’t need you sticking up for me, Kale.” Agatha got to her feet. “I’ll lay things out simply for you all. My mom was a bitch and she died. She fell down the stairs. Am I sad about it? Not at all. In fact, it was the best thing that ever happened to me, but she fell down the stairs. No big conspiracy. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need something stronger than wine.”</p><p>Rio watched her fiancée leave and moved to follow her before Lilia put a handout to stop her.</p><p>“Let me,” her future (god)mother-in-law insisted. “I’ve dealt with this for long enough.”</p><p>Lilia followed Agatha out of the room, leaving Rio to hold down the fort.</p><p>“Alice, Agatha didn’t have a good childhood. I know all three of our lives have been marked by tragedy, but it’s different for her than for us. Her mother was cruel, and it took her dying for her to finally be free. The money means nothing.”</p><p>Alice pursed her lips, avoiding Rio’s gaze. “I want you to be safe and happy.”</p><p>“I am,” Rio insisted. “The only person making me unhappy right now is you!”</p><p>“I don’t mean to! I just find this all too good to be true!”</p><p>Rio’s heart sank further, tears stinging her eyes. “Is it really that hard to believe that someone loves me?”</p><p>Alice’s eyes widened. “No, of course not! I just find it…” Her shoulders slumped. “Rio, I’ve known you a long time. You’re of course beautiful…”</p><p>Jen cleared her throat and Alice rolled her eyes. “Babe, she’s like my sister.”</p><p>Jen sighed. “Fine. Continue.”</p><p>“You’re beautiful, and kind, and generous, but you’re also a little…naïve at times. You see the best in everyone, but it sometimes means you don’t realise people’s true intentions.”</p><p>Rio considered this. She recalled when she first took Agatha to Rome, how she’d missed Honey’s flirtations for months when Agatha spotted it almost instantly. How many times had this happened without her realising. Was she truly that oblivious?</p><p>“I can understand that, but you don’t have to worry in this case.”</p><p>“How can I not?” Alice argued. “From the moment you saw her, you’ve had hearts in your eyes, and I’m worried it’s blinding you.”</p><p>“I’m not blind. I know Agatha has her…quirks, but you can’t choose who you fall in love with, and even if I could, I wouldn’t change my mind. Agatha is the only woman I’ve ever had feels for, or even looked at in that way…”</p><p>“Not true,” Carol interjected.</p><p>“What do you mean?” Rio questioned.</p><p>“Agatha isn’t the only woman and you damn well know it.”</p><p>Rio frowned. “I’ve never loved anyone in the way I love Agatha.”</p><p>“That’s not what you said. You said you’ve never looked at another woman other than her and that’s an outright lie. You worked out you were gay before we met.”</p><p>“I can notice that other women are beautiful,” Rio argued. “That just makes me human. This is different.”</p><p>“And what about Hela when you were all cosy during that skiing trip?” Carol questioned. “I know you didn’t go all the way, but…”</p><p>“I was curious!” Rio quickly defended herself. “It was never…it wasn’t…”</p><p>“And let’s not forget party girl,” Alice interjected, and Carol clicked her fingers.</p><p>“Yes! She spent six months sulking because she thought she’d fumbled the love of her life.”</p><p>Rio put her head in her hands. She hated thinking about that night. Not that she was precious about the idea of virginity, but she did wish she could erase it. That her first time was the one she could remember. With Agatha on the edge of Lake Como. That it was actually something meaningful.</p><p>“You two are twisting her words,” Jen finally butted in. “It doesn’t matter what women have existed in Rio’s past, and you don’t need to overanalyse everything. Rio is grown, and if her and Agatha are happy, that should be enough.”</p><p>Rio looked to Alice hopefully, but her best friend simply got to her feet and walked out of the room. They all watched her leave, Jen seemingly divided, but they all stayed seated. All stayed quiet…until Carol eventually spoke up again.</p><p>“You know, it’s really bugging me where I know Agatha from.”</p><p>Rio dropped her head to the table. She wanted to book a direct flight back to Italy pronto.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha raided through Jen’s pantry, displeased with each bottle she picked up. She heard the kitchen door open. “Jen, where’s your hard liquor?”</p><p>“Not Jen.”</p><p>Agatha looked over her shoulder and saw Lilia stood behind her. Oh great. A serious talk. She quickly turned her attention back to the cupboard.</p><p>“Jen has nothing but fancy wine. Not even a bottle of Jack.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“That’s my name.”</p><p>“You need to tell the whole story.”</p><p>Agatha laughed. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“No, Lilia. I’m not dragging all that up again. I want to move on with my life, and I’d been doing a good job of it until you dragged me to that fucking fundraiser. Now I’m in love with one of the richest women in the world and her friends are assholes.”</p><p>“Alice isn’t an asshole,” Lilia assured. “And you have nothing to be ashamed of.”</p><p>“Then I don’t have to explain myself,” Agatha countered, before a bottle caught her eye. “Aha!”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha held up the bottle for her godmother to see. “Good old tequila.”</p><p>“Agatha!” Lilia snapped. “Enough!”</p><p>Suddenly she was a teenager again, still pushing against boundaries that no longer existed. She looked to Lilia, the only parental figure she’d ever had, and reluctantly set the tequila aside.</p><p>“I didn’t want any of this,” she admitted. “Do any of you get that? I-I liked Rio before Italy, but I pushed her away because I didn’t want this fucking mess again. But Rio had to make me fall head over heels in love with her and I was stupid enough to think that everything would be fine while we were thousands of miles away. Now I can’t go back because the thought of living without her makes my heart hurt so I guess I’m miserable either way.”</p><p>“Have you told Rio this?”</p><p>“She knows I don’t like this, and she’s been good about it, but what more can she do? Alice is like family to her. I can see this is making her miserable.”</p><p>Lilia reached out and rubbed her arm. They weren’t huggers, but Agatha appreciated the act. “Everything will be alright.”</p><p>“How can you possibly know that?”</p><p>“Because I do.”</p><p>“How reassuring.”</p><p>“Just trust me,” Lilia assured. “It’ll all be okay.”</p><p>Agatha decided to relent. “I hope you’re right.”</p><p>Lilia smiled. “You really love her, don’t you?”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha admitted. “It took me a while to catch up, but I think I understand what it was like for Rio when we met. Now I look at her and…I don’t think I’ve ever loved anything as much as I love her. No offense.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “Trust me, I’m delighted. All I’ve ever wanted was for you to be happy.”</p><p>Agatha then narrowed her eyes. “Tell anyone and I’ll tell them about your wild weekend in Vienna.”</p><p>Lilia laughed and held a hand over her heart. “Don’t worry, Agatha. I won’t let anyone know you have feelings.”</p><p>“Good.” Agatha then reached for the tequila bottle. “Let’s seal it with a with a shot.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled and retrieved some glasses. “I know I raised you well.”</p><p>“You did,” Agatha agreed. “All my good parts come from you.”</p><p>Neither of them commented on the way their eyes glistened. After all, it was just a trick of the light.</p><p> </p><p>Jen’s penthouse had access to a large balcony, looking out over the city, enclosed by a tall railing. Rio found Alice stood out there, staring out across the building tops as she took a drag of her cigarette.</p><p>After a moment of consideration, Rio decided to join her. “Got another one of those?”</p><p>Alice wordlessly reached into her jacket pocket and handed Rio the pack of cigarettes and her zippo lighter. She pulled one out and lit it, before giving both back.</p><p>“Thanks.”</p><p>Alice once again didn’t respond, and so they stood side by side taking drags as the last sign of the sun began to fade from the sky. Rio waited, and waited, her cigarette half finished when her best friend finally found her voice.</p><p>“I’m sorry.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio answered. “And I understand why you had your apprehensions, even if I don’t agree with all your reasoning.”</p><p>Alice turned to face her fully. “You’re the only family I have left, Rio. Sure, I have Jen, Carol, and others I can count on, but you’re different. We’ve been through so much, stood by each other through good and bad. I want you to be happy, but I also worry you’re going to get hurt.”</p><p>“I feel the same,” Rio replied honestly. “And I do appreciate you wanting to look after me, but I need to make my own decisions. I want to be with Agatha. She’s my choice.”</p><p>“I know.” Alice bowed her head. “I’m sorry for believing the rumours.”</p><p>“I’m not the person you should be apologizing to,” Rio pointed out. “Agatha has been through enough without our inner circle believing her antagonists.”</p><p>“I’m going to set Nat and Yelena straight, too,” Alice insisted. “I don’t know how it’ll go down though. Yelena is close with Kate.”</p><p>“We’ll cross that bridge another day,” Rio answered. “All that matters is that we’re okay again.”</p><p>“We are,” Alice assured. “And I’ll make things right with Agatha.”</p><p>“Good.” Rio took another drag from her cigarette. “I thought you were quitting?”</p><p>“I thought you had quit.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “Touché.”</p><p>They headed back inside and when they entered the dining room, she was relieved to see Agatha at the table, laughing with Lilia and Jen at a story Carol was telling.</p><p>“So I told the guy I was flying the plane and he looked to Fury and said ‘I thought you were the pilot?’. So fury looked him dead in the eye and said “You let me drink all this champagne when you thought I was flying the motherfucking plane?’”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes. She’d heard that story more times that she could count. Still, it was nice to see her fiancée laugh after what had already been an eventual night.</p><p>It was Carol who looked to them first, her bright smile not faltering. “Ah. Look who it is.”</p><p>Jen’s lips pursed, Lilia’s eyes looked between them nervously, while Agatha folded her arms. Not in challenge, though it may seem so to some, but Rio knew it was in defence. As most of her I-don’t-give-a-fuck façade truly was.</p><p>Alice stepped ahead of Rio and made her way over to Agatha. “I’m sorry for believing stupid rumours. I was worried about my friend, but it seems I’ve just made things worse.”</p><p>Rio worried for a moment. As much as she adored her fiancée, she knew she wasn’t always the most…reasonable, and in this case she had more than enough cause to shun Alice’s apology. Yet, to her surprise, Agatha nodded in acceptance.</p><p>“Thank you, Alice.”</p><p>“I hope we can find a way to move past this,” Alice added. “Considering we’re pretty much family now.”</p><p>Agatha laughed nervously. “I’ve never been too good with family.”</p><p>“Hey, my mom was an unhinged rockstar who died in a hotel fire when I needed her most. Family isn’t something that comes natural to me either, but I think we can work this out.”</p><p>Alice sat back down beside Jen, who reached for her hand and squeezed it. Rio smiled and returned to her future wife’s side.</p><p>“You okay?” She asked, and Agatha nodded.</p><p>“Much better.” She gave Rio a quick kiss on the lips before quickly pulling back and frowning. “You’ve been smoking?”</p><p>“Just one.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a disapproving look. “Make sure it’s your last.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Of course, my love.”</p><p>“Unless you’re sharing with me then that’s fine.”</p><p>Rio laughed and kissed her cheek. “You have yourself a deal.”</p>
