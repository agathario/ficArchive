<div class="userstuff">
<p>The morning light over Westview was thin and grey, the kind that promised nothing. </p><p>Perfect. Agatha preferred beginnings that didn’t try to romance her.</p><p>By 7:15am she was already on the surgical floor, lab coat immaculate, hair pinned back with mathematical precision, stethoscope gleaming like a weapon. She’d arrived early on purpose, she wanted to see the place before anyone expected warmth from her.</p><p>The plaque on the open office door read- <strong>Dr Natasha Romanoff</strong>- Chief of Surgery.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness,” came the low, assured voice from inside. “Come in.”</p><p>Natasha Romanoff was precisely the kind of woman who could make a hospital obey without raising her voice — poised, economical, with eyes that could flay through fabrications. She gestured to the chair opposite her desk.</p><p>“Welcome to Westview General,” she said. “Smaller hospital than you’re used to, but you’ll find the work no less meaningful.”</p><p>Agatha sat. “I’m here for meaningful, not glamorous.”</p><p>“That’s good,” Natasha said. “You won’t find much glamour here. What you will find—” she flipped through the folder before her, “—are strong letters. ‘Unflinching in crisis.’ ‘Surgical instincts beyond her year.’ ‘Composed under pressure.’ That’s quite a reputation, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p>“Product of long hours and hard work.” Agatha said.</p><p>Natasha nodded once. “And a loss,” she said carefully. “A patient. I’m sorry.”</p><p>The words were simple, but they found their mark. Agatha’s mouth went dry.</p><p>“I appreciate that,” she said, clearing her throat, her voice neutral, clipped.</p><p>Natasha closed the folder, tone softening. “You’ll fit in here. We’re a smaller, less political hospital, no fancy clinical trials. But the staff’s close. Feels like one big family.”</p><p>Agatha gave the faintest eye-roll before she could stop herself. “I’ll take that under advisement.”</p><p>Natasha smiled. “You just want to do your job.”</p><p>“That’s why I’m here.”</p><p>“Then do it well. And try not to terrify the nurses before lunch.”</p><p>“No promises,” Agatha said, standing.</p><p>Natasha’s laugh followed her out the door.</p><p>                                         </p><p><br/>The first half of the day crawled by.</p><p>Westview General, as it turned out, was quiet. Too quiet. The kind of quiet that felt less like peace and more like sedation.</p><p>By 10:00am, she’d seen three sprained ankles, two allergic reactions (one to peanuts, one to shellfish), and one very dramatic woman convinced her appendix was rupturing —it wasn’t.</p><p>A construction worker came in with a bandaged hand, claiming he’d been bitten by a “rabid pigeon.” It was, in fact, a parakeet.</p><p>A high-schooler arrived shortly after, clutching his side and moaning in agony. The diagnosis? Gas.</p><p>By noon, Agatha was contemplating the meaning of her career choices. She’d left Boston General — the heart of surgical innovation, the adrenaline capital of the Eastern Seaboard — for this.</p><p>She checked her reflection in the medicine cabinet mirror during a brief lull.<br/> “You wanted quiet,” she muttered to herself. “Congratulations.”</p><p>At 2:30 p.m., Nurse Wanda Maximoff appeared beside her, arms crossed, watching her update a chart.<br/>Wanda had the kind of presence that didn’t announce itself — it <em>arrived.</em> Her scrubs were a deep wine-red, a shade that looked deliberate against her pale skin and auburn hair, which she’d twisted into a loose braid that was already escaping its tie. A faint scent of coffee and cinnamon followed her, oddly grounding in the sterile air.</p><p>“You’ve had the full Westview experience already, huh?” she asked, her accent a soft, melodic lilt that turned even sarcasm into something kind.</p><p>Agatha didn’t glance up. “If by experience you mean mild tedium and several questionable uses of the emergency department, then yes.”</p><p>Wanda’s grin widened, her teeth catching the light. “You’ll get used to it. Some of the regulars come here for attention, not medicine.”</p><p>Agatha finally looked over. Wanda’s eyes were green — really green — sharp when she focused, warm when she smiled. They were warm now. </p><p>Agatha signed the bottom of the chart, unamused. “Fascinating.”</p><p>Wanda leaned lightly against the counter, close enough that Agatha could feel her presence without it being intrusive. “Cheer up, Doctor. You’ll get a real one soon enough.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “I’m not sure I believe in that anymore.” She shut the chart with a decisive snap. “Everyone seems to be bleeding metaphorically.”</p><p>Wanda laughed softly.<br/>“Give it time. The night shift likes to keep things interesting.”<br/>There was something knowing in her tone, a teasing sort of warmth, like she’d seen a hundred doctors come through, all sharp edges and ambition, and decided this one didn’t have to stay made of ice.</p><p>Agatha didn’t like the implication of <em>give it time</em>.</p><p>She preferred control. Schedules. Predictability.</p><p>By 3:00pm, she was restocking a supply cart when another voice — confident, amused — carried across the ER.</p><p>“So you’re the Boston import everyone’s been whispering about.”</p><p>Agatha turned.</p><p>A tall Black woman stood in the doorway, posture relaxed, a smirk playing at the edge of her full mouth. </p><p>Her pink scrub sleeves were rolled to her elbows, showing strong forearms dusted faintly with flour-white powder from latex gloves. The buzzcut made her look severe in theory, but somehow it only added to the startling beauty of her face — clean lines, striking eyes, and a self-assurance that bordered on arrogant.</p><p>Her badge read DR. JENNIFER KALE.</p><p>“Dr. Kale,” Agatha said, offering a polite nod.</p><p>“The one and only,” Jen said, stepping in. “Emergency medicine. We’ll be sharing the joy that is Westview General.”</p><p>“Charming,” Agatha said, flat as glass.</p><p>Jen’s grin grew. “Boston General, right? Big leagues. I did a trauma rotation there once — lasted two months before I realised that I value my sleep and sanity.”</p><p>“Then you made the right choice,” Agatha replied without looking up from her chart.</p><p>“I usually do,” Jen said easily. “Though the Chief said you don’t blink under pressure. That true, or is that just your reputation?”</p><p>Agatha kept her tone neutral. “I suppose that depends on what you’d call pressure.”</p><p>Jen chuckled, clearly enjoying herself. “Touché.”</p><p>Agatha moved to file the chart. “If you’re trying to test me, Dr. Kale, I assure you I’m not very interesting.”</p><p>Jen tilted her head. “I’m starting to think that’s not true.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a level, unimpressed look. “You think a lot, apparently.”</p><p>Jen grinned wider, unbothered, intrigued. “I do. Keeps the brain sharp.”</p><p>“Well,” Agatha said, stepping past her to reach for a set of gloves, “try not to overexert yourself.”</p><p>That earned a short laugh — genuine this time. “All right, Doctor Harkness. I’ll leave you to your peace and quiet. But fair warning — nobody keeps to themselves here for long. The walls in this place talk.”</p><p>“I don’t listen to walls,” Agatha said curtly.</p><p>“Sure you don’t.” Jen winked, turning toward the main corridor. “See you at hamdover.”</p><p>When she was gone, Agatha exhaled slowly and realised she’d been holding her shoulders a little too stiff. The last thing she wanted was idle gossip surrounding her here.</p><p><br/>By 6:00pm, the sky had bruised itself purple outside the windows, and Agatha was counting the minutes until she could hand over to the night team. Her first day had been an endless carousel of non-urgent absurdities — and the thought of doing it all again tomorrow left her feeling vaguely cheated.</p><p>She was slipping her pen into her coat pocket when she heard it.</p><p>Sirens.</p><p>Loud, close, cutting through the hum of the hospital like the first real heartbeat of the day.</p><p>The intercom crackled to life- “<em><strong>Multiple trauma incoming — MVC on Highway 22. Estimated arrival, three minutes.</strong></em>”</p><p>Everything shifted at once.</p><p>The tired rhythm of the ER quickened, snapping into sharp, controlled movement. Nurses moved with practiced coordination, monitors flickered to life, gloves snapped.</p><p>Adrenaline surged through Agatha’s bloodstream — that clean, steady rush she hadn’t felt in months.<br/>She pulled on gloves, tied her trauma gown over her white coat. The old rhythm returned as naturally as breathing.</p><p>The double doors burst open.</p><p>Two stretchers rolled in, soaked, rainwater dripping onto the tile. <br/>Paramedics shouted vitals over the din. Behind them came four firefighters, uniforms damp, boots heavy with soot and grit.<br/>“Collision with a semi,” someone called. “Driver’s side crushed!”</p><p>Agatha moved without hesitation. “Get me the field report,” she said sharply.</p><p>A paramedic — young, petite, dark hair sticking to her forehead with red and orange flashes poking through some strands— peeled off her gloves and stepped up beside her. Her badge read ALICE WU-GULLIVER.</p><p>“Patient was unresponsive at scene,” Alice reported quickly, still catching her breath. “BP eighty over fifty when we found him. We stabilised him with two large-bore IVs, got fluids running before transport. Pulse was weak, but we brought it up to ninety by the time we got here.”</p><p>Agatha checked the patient’s vitals, already moving in sync with the report. “Good work. You bought us time.”</p><p>Alice blinked — startled by the compliment, perhaps because it came so clipped, so precise. Then she smiled — a wide, genuine grin that brightened her whole face.</p><p>“Thank you, Doctor.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up again — couldn’t, not when adrenaline still buzzed in her fingertips — but she allowed herself the faintest nod.</p><p>“Let’s get him to trauma one,” she said. “Page radiology. We’re moving.”</p><p>The next half-hour passed in the rhythm she lived for — clear orders, measured chaos, life hanging in the balance and her hands the hinge between it.</p><p>She stitched, suctioned, stabilised. The hum of the ventilator and the controlled bark of instructions filled the air around her like music.</p><p>When the patient was finally transferred to ICU, stable and breathing on his own, the room deflated with quiet satisfaction.</p><p>Tony Stark — a firefighter who’d swaggered in with EMT — leaned on a gurney nearby, watching her. </p><p>“You’re something else, Doc. You run that room like a war general.”</p><p>Agatha snapped off her gloves. “It’s called doing one’s job. You should really try it sometime.”</p><p>He grinned. “You make it look scary. I like a woman who terrifies me.”</p><p>Before she could reply, Wanda walked by with a knowing smile. “Don’t mind him,” she said to Agatha. “Stark flirts with everyone who moves. You’re just the first one to shut him down before he could finish his sentence.”</p><p>“I’m definitely not interested.” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>Wanda laughed. “You’ll fit in just fine here.”</p><p>Agatha doubted that.</p><p>But as she looked around the trauma bay, something inside her eased despite herself.</p><p>Tony Stark was leaning against the wall, sweat-soaked and grinning like he’d just won something. Nurse Maximoff was rolling her eyes at him, fond and exasperated all at once as she wiped down an IV pole.</p><p>Across the room, Dr. Kale was speaking softly to a patient on the next gurney — a teenage girl, shaken but alive. Jen’s deep voice carried reassurance without condescension, her tall frame bent slightly so she could meet the girl’s eyes.</p><p>“Hey,” Jen said, smiling just enough to be kind but not patronising, “you’re all right now. Deep breaths, okay? You did good.”</p><p>Her gloved hand steadied the patient’s trembling one as she checked vitals, voice low and even, a steady anchor in the noise. There was a gentleness there that Agatha hadn’t expected, and for a brief, uncomfortable moment, she admired it.</p><p>Noted it, then dismissed it.</p><p><em>Focus</em>, she told herself.</p><p>Maybe Westview wasn’t glamorous.<br/> Maybe it wasn’t Boston.</p><p>But for the first time in weeks, she felt something close to what she used to feel — the hum of life at her fingertips, purpose crackling in her blood.</p><p>She peeled off her gloves, set them aside, and finally allowed herself a long exhale.</p><p>That was when she noticed one last firefighter standing near the bay doors, just outside the circle of motion.</p><p>She hadn’t spoken much through the chaos — just assisted where needed, calm and steady, movements precise. Dark hair still damp, face streaked faintly with grime, she was quieter than the rest.</p><p>And then Agatha saw it- blood dripping, slow and rhythmic, from the cuff of her jacket.</p><p>Not patient blood. Her own.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “You,” she said sharply, crossing the space in a few strides. “You’re bleeding.”</p><p>The firefighter glanced down at her sleeve, as if only now noticing the red seeping through the heavy fabric. “Caught it on the wreckage,” she said evenly. “Metal edge. It’s nothing.”</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha repeated flatly, “is not currently staining my floor.”</p><p>The woman hesitated — then, finally, the smallest flicker of a smile tugged at her mouth. There was a faint gap between her top teeth, and somehow, it made the smile disarming instead of careless. “Noted, Doctor.”</p><p>“Sit,” Agatha ordered, already snapping on a new pair of gloves. “Before you pass out and make my evening worse.”</p><p>There was a quiet beat of surprise, then the firefighter obeyed without argument, sinking onto the edge of a gurney.</p><p>Up close, Agatha saw the tear in her jacket sleeve, the deep but clean laceration along her upper arm — just above the bicep, where the muscle was corded and firm beneath tanned skin. She was strong, but not bulky — the kind of strength built from long shifts and real labour, from holding weight that wasn’t hers to carry.</p><p>“Name?”</p><p>“Vidal,” she said. “Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond immediately, too focused on cleaning the wound. The skin around it was slick with a mix of rainwater and blood.</p><p>“You’ll need sutures,” she said, brisk and efficient.</p><p>Rio gave a small shrug. “I’ve had worse.”</p><p>“Unimpressive,” Agatha replied dryly, reaching for the needle driver. “Hold still.”</p><p>Rio did. Silent. Unflinching.</p><p>The silence between them wasn’t awkward — just heavy, filled with the quiet rhythm of Agatha’s work and the muffled hum of the ER winding down.</p><p>When she tied off the final stitch, Agatha sat back slightly. “You’ll live.”</p><p>“I’ll put that on a T-shirt,” Rio said softly.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow, but the corner of her mouth betrayed her. Just barely.</p><p>Rio’s answering smile was small but real.</p><p>When Agatha finally stood, peeling off her gloves, she caught herself watching the firefighter a moment longer than necessary — taking in the calmness, the steadiness, the faint smear of soot at the edge of her jaw.</p><p>“Keep it clean and no heavy lifting for a week.” she said, almost absently.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>Their eyes met — calm brown against storm-grey — and for a heartbeat too long, Agatha felt something shift. </p><p>Something small but undeniable.</p><p>Maybe Westview wasn’t as dull as she’d thought.</p><p> </p><p><br/>The rain had stopped by the time Agatha left the hospital. The air was cool and heavy, the streets slick with a sheen of mist that glowed under the lamps. She drove slowly, windows cracked just enough to let the damp air in to keep herself awake.</p><p>It was a short drive, ten minutes at most, down quiet roads lined with old oaks and tidy houses whose porches already bore the soft fllicker of evening lights.</p><p>The cottage sat near the end of a curved lane, half-hidden by ivy and a garden that looked too wild to be accidental. A warm light glowed behind its windows.</p><p>Agatha still wasn’t used to it — to the narrow driveway, to the uneven path of flagstones leading to the door, to the faint creak of the porch underfoot. She’d only been here a week, but everything about it felt distinctly <em>Lilia</em>, deliberate chaos, comforting clutter, plants in every possible surface and the faint scent of sage and something sweetly floral in the air.</p><p>She unlocked the door and stepped into warmth.<br/>“About time,” Lilia called from the kitchen. “I was starting to think that hospital had consumed you.”</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, hanging her coat and bag by the door. “I survived.”</p><p>“You sound disappointed,” Lilia said. She was at the stove, hair a soft silver crown pinned in its usual twist, wearing a shawl patterned with constellations and patchwork. </p><p>The smell of rosemary and garlic filled the room.</p><p>“I’m not disappointed,” Agatha said, moving toward the kitchen. “Just… unimpressed.”</p><p>Lilia turned, amusement flickering in her dark eyes. “Ah. So the day went <em>well</em>.”</p><p>“If by ‘well’ you mean dull beyond comprehension, yes.”</p><p>“Small towns will do that,” Lilia said, ladling stew into two bowls. “People here come to the ER for something to do.”</p><p>“I’ve noticed,” Agatha muttered, lowering herself into a chair at the kitchen table. The wood still smelled faintly of polish and lemon, everything in this house had a scent.</p><p>Lilia set a steaming bowl in front of her, then took her own seat across the table. “Eat. And no back-talk.”</p><p>Agatha obliged, taking a spoonful of lentil stew — the same recipe Lilia had made when she was sixteen and studying for exams at the Calderu kitchen table, back before med school, before Boston, before <em>everything.</em></p><p>“I’m too tired to be hungry,” she said, but kept eating anyway.</p><p>Lilia smiled faintly. “First week’s the hardest. You’ve been running on nerves and caffeine since you arrived.”</p><p>Agatha gave a short, humourless laugh. “I’ve been running on instinct.”</p><p>Lilia watched her quietly for a moment, something thoughtful passing over her face. “You know,” she said, “I wasn’t sure you’d actually come.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand paused midair.</p><p>“You sounded…” Lilia searched for the word, “shattered. When you called.”</p><p>Agatha set the spoon down, jaw tightening. “That’s a little dramatic.”</p><p>“True, though,” Lilia said softly. “You were crying… You don’t cry.”</p><p>Agatha looked away, eyes fixed on the grain of the table. “I couldn’t stay there, Lilia. Every corridor was him. Every nurse remembered his name. Every time I scrubbed in, I saw his face.”</p><p>“Nicky,” Lilia said quietly.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught — a sound, not quite a sob, more a tremor she refused to let through.</p><p>Lilia reached across the table, laying a hand over Agatha’s. “So you came here. Like I told you to.”</p><p>“You didn’t tell me,” Agatha murmured. “You commanded”</p><p>“I offered,” Lilia said with a small smile. “You just finally said yes.”</p><p>Agatha let out a slow breath. “You’ve been here ten years now. It still feels like I’m intruding.”</p><p>“You’re not,” Lilia said simply. “You’re home.”</p><p>“Your home,” Agatha corrected.</p><p>“Our home,” Lilia said, firm but kind. “It was always waiting for you. You just needed to be ready to arrive.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing for a long moment. The ticking of the old kitchen clock filled the space between them.</p><p>Finally, Lilia changed the subject, voice lighter. “And how was your first shift? Surely Westview gave you something worth your talent.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then nodded. “Multi-vehicle collision. One critical. Several minor. It was… chaos.”</p><p>“Which means you loved it,” Lilia teased gently.</p><p>“I didn’t hate it.”</p><p>Lilia smiled knowingly. “That’s as close to joy as you get, my dear.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but there was no heat in it. “The team handled it well. Kale — the ER doctor — was competent, even kind. Maximoff was… efficient.”</p><p>Agatha paused, a small smile creeping on her face as brown eyes and a small gapped tooth smile flashed in memory.</p><p>“And?”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, fighting the pull of the memory — the smell of rain, the hush after the sirens, and that quiet firefighter sitting on the gurney as Agatha stitched her arm, her warm brown eyes never leaving Agatha’s face.</p><p>“And one of the firefighters was injured,” Agatha said finally. “Laceration on her arm. I sutured it.”</p><p>Lilia’s brow arched, smile curving with subtle delight. “Ah. And?”</p><p>“And nothing,” Agatha said, perhaps a little too sharply. “She was polite. Cooperative.”</p><p>“Pretty?”</p><p>Agatha’s spoon froze halfway to her mouth. “Irrelevant.”</p><p>Lilia’s smile deepened. “Which means yes.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled heavily. “You’re insufferable.”</p><p>“Part of my charm,” Lilia said.</p><p>“I don’t know why I tell you anything.”</p><p>“Because I raised you,” Lilia said simply. “And I still know how to read you better than you do yourself.”</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly. “Unfair advantage.”</p><p>“Someone has to keep up,” Lilia said. She leaned back, folding her hands. “You’ve been here a week and already sound… different. A little less haunted.”</p><p>Agatha stared down at her stew, the surface trembling with the faintest ripple. “Maybe I’m just tired.”</p><p>“Or maybe,” Lilia said softly, “something here is good for you. Someone, perhaps.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a warning look, but it only made Lilia’s grin widen.</p><p>“Go to bed,” Lilia said, standing to clear the dishes. “Before you start arguing with me and lose.”</p><p>“I never lose.”</p><p>“Mm,” Lilia hummed. “We’ll see.”</p><p>Agatha rose, collected her coat from the hook, and paused at the threshold of the hallway. “Goodnight.”</p><p>“Goodnight, my girl.”</p><p>She climbed the stairs to the small guest room — hers now — and paused at the window, watching the fog drift across the garden.</p><p>It still wasn’t home, not quite. The walls didn’t know her yet. But the air felt easier to breathe.</p><p>And somewhere, behind the static hum of the night, she could still hear that quiet voice from the ER saying:<br/><em>Noted, Doctor</em>.</p>

<p>A week had passed since Agatha Harkness started at Westview General.</p><p>The town had already begun to sink its quiet rhythm under her skin — the soft fog each morning, the half-empty streets at dawn, the scent of damp leaves that clung to everything. </p><p>The hospital itself was smaller than she was used to, slower, but there was comfort in the predictability of it.<br/>
Every day began the same, a coffee so strong it could dissolve metal, a ten-minute drive from Lilia’s ivy-covered cottage, and a mental checklist of everything she intended to control.</p><p>By the time she walked through the staff entrance, coat crisp, hair pinned, expression unreadable, she was the version of herself she knew best, precise, detached, competent.</p><p>The ER was already awake, humming with its usual morning chorus of machines, monitors, and human noise.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness!”</p><p>The bright voice came from the nurses’ station. Wanda, in her burgundy scrubs, waved a clipboard like a flag.  <br/>
“Your new intern’s here! Been waiting half an hour. Looks like he’s aged a year from nerves.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Intern?”</p><p>“Chief Romanoff’s orders,” Wanda said, trying, and failing, to hide her grin. “She said you’re exactly the kind of influence he needs.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened slightly. “God help him.”</p><p>Wanda chuckled. “He’s by the coffee machine. You’ll know which one.”</p><p>She didn’t elaborate, which was warning enough.</p><p>Sure enough, at the far end of the corridor stood a young man wh looked like he’d wandered out of a college band and gotten lost in the hospital. </p><p>He was tall and awkward, all elbows and curly black hair, a stethoscope hanging too low around his neck. The faint trace of black eyeliner made his wide brown eyes look even bigger like a startled cat.</p><p>He noticed her instantly and froze, mid-sip of coffee.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness?” he blurted, spilling half the cup down his sleeve.</p><p>Agatha blinked once. “That would be me.”</p><p>“I’m—uh—William Caplan! Your intern!” He fumbled his ID badge straight. </p><p>“Huge honour. Really. I read your case report on mitral valve rupture at Boston General. The one where you—uh—used a modified continuous suture pattern instead of standard interrupted technique? Genius!”</p><p>Agatha stared at him for a long moment. “You read my case reports.”</p><p>“Yes! And your trauma management notes. And, uh, the emergency thoracotomy article from the—”</p><p>“Stop talking,” she said mildly.</p><p>He stopped.</p><p>Wanda, passing by with a chart, murmured under her breath, “He’s very enthusiastic.”</p><p>“I can tell,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Caplan straightened his coat, trying to recover. “Right. Sorry. I just—uh—wanted to say it’s an honour to work under you. I promise I’ll work hard. Really hard. Maybe too hard.”</p><p>Agatha studied him for a moment, the nervous shifting, the bright eyes, the too-big coat. “How old are you, Caplan?”</p><p>“Uh… twenty-four, ma’am. Doctor.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly. “Are you sure? You look like you should still be asking permission to go to prom.”</p><p>His mouth opened, then closed again. “I—what?”</p><p>Wanda laughed outright from behind the desk.</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly. “I’ll call you <em>Teen</em>. Easier to remember.”</p><p>“Teen?” he echoed, bewildered.</p><p>“It suits you.”</p><p>“I—okay,” he said weakly. “Teen it is?”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said, already turning toward the triage wing. “Now come on, Teen. Observation first. No interruptions unless I ask. And if you faint, do it somewhere discreet.”</p><p>“I don’t faint!” he said too quickly.</p><p>“Good. Then keep up.”</p><p>He followed at a near jog.</p><p>The first hour went smoothly enough. A sprained wrist, a mild concussion, a diabetic fainting spell — the usual small-town emergencies. Teen hovered close but quiet, scribbling notes that looked frantic even from a distance.</p><p>By the time they returned to the nurses’ station, Dr. Kale was leaning over a counter, chatting with Wanda while sorting through patient files. Her laugh carried easily across the room.</p><p>Jen straightened when she saw Agatha approach, tall and effortlessly striking, her buzzcut gleaming under the fluorescent lights. “Morning, Doctor Harkness. Breaking in the new kid?”</p><p>Caplan went a little pink. “Trying to keep up.”</p><p>Jen gave him an approving smile. “Good luck. She doesn’t slow down for anyone.”</p><p>“The way everyone should be,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Jen’s grin only widened. “That’s why we love you, Harkness. Keeps the rest of us honest.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Is that what we’re calling it?”</p><p>“Sure,” Jen said lightly. “Honesty, fear…same thing.”</p><p>Wanda snorted behind her hand.</p><p>Agatha ignored them both, flipping open a chart. “If the two of you are quite finished, some of us have work to do.”</p><p>Jen smirked. “You’re going soft. You gave the kid a nickname already.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. “Easier to remember, I’m managing expectations.”</p><p>“Of him or yourself?” Jen teased.</p><p>“Both,” Agatha said coolly. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, Teen and I have patients.”</p><p>Wanda grinned as Agatha swept away, Caplan scurrying after her. “She likes you already!”</p><p>Caplan blinked. “Thats <em>liking me?</em>”</p><p>“Coming from her?” Wanda said. “It’s practically a hug.”</p><p>It wasn’t glamorous. It wasn’t Boston.<br/>
 But as Agatha moved through the rhythm of the ward — clear orders, steady work, quiet control — she felt, for the first time since arriving, the smallest glimmer of steadiness.</p><p>Detached, yes. But functional.<br/>
 Exactly how she liked it.</p><p>By midafternoon, the ER had settled into its rhythm, controlled chaos, the kind Agatha could measure her pulse by. Her new intern, Teen, had stopped tripping over cables, which she decided counted as improvement.</p><p>She was reviewing discharge notes when Wanda’s voice called from the corridor.<br/>
 “Bay Four, Doctor — one of your old patients. From the crash last week.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. “Mine?”</p><p>“Technically,” Wanda said, a teasing lilt in her tone. “You did the sutures.”</p><p>Agatha finished signing the chart and moved to the next bay.</p><p>And there she was again, the firefighter from that night. </p><p>Vidal.</p><p>She sat quietly on the edge of the gurney, hands clasped in her lap. Her dark hair was tied back, a few curls escaping around her temples. Her navy Fire &amp; Rescue T-shirt clung to her shoulders, sleeves short enough to show off those damn toned forearms. </p><p>She had the kind of stillness that drew attention without asking for it- quiet, composed, eyes lowered as she waited.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze went to her arm immediately. </p><p>The dressing was half off. The sutures —<em> her</em> sutures — had torn.</p><p>Agatha’s voice cut clean through the hum of the room. “You reopened the incision.”</p><p>Rio looked up at her, startled but not defensive. Her voice was soft, steady. “I think I caught it on something. It started bleeding a little a few days ago, but it stopped.”</p><p>“Bleeding a <em>little</em>?” Agatha repeated, stepping closer. “You were told to avoid lifting anything heavy. Clearly that instruction was too complex.”</p><p>Wanda, across the bay, smirked. “Easy, Doctor. She came back, didn’t she?”</p><p>Agatha ignored her, snapping on gloves. “Sit up straighter.”</p><p>Rio obeyed immediately, shoulders straightening, gaze dropping again. She didn’t flinch when Agatha began peeling back the edge of the dressing, though her breath hitched when antiseptic touched the skin.</p><p>The wound had reopened in two places — not badly, but enough to irritate Agatha’s sense of order.</p><p>“What did you lift?” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio hesitated, then nodded once. “We had a training drill. I didn’t think—”</p><p>“Clearly.” Agatha’s tone softened, almost imperceptibly. “You’re fortunate it didn’t reopen completely.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered up — warm brown, deep and steady. “Sorry.”</p><p>It wasn’t defensive, just simple and sincere.</p><p>Something in Agatha stilled. She wasn’t used to apologies that weren’t excuses.</p><p>“Don’t be,” she said briskly, reaching for a fresh suture kit. “Just hold still.”</p><p>Wanda moved closer, rolling up her sleeves. “I can do it—”</p><p>“No,” Agatha interrupted. “She’s my patient. I’ll redo them.”</p><p>Wanda’s smirk returned, softer this time. “Of course.”</p><p>Agatha focused on her work, the neat precision of motion, the familiar rhythm of needle and thread. <br/>
Rio didn’t move, didn’t fidget, didn’t even look away. Only the slow rise and fall of her breathing betrayed her discomfort.</p><p>“Not squeamish,” Agatha murmured, mostly to herself.</p><p>Rio’s lips curved faintly, not a smile, exactly, but something gentler. “We see worse.”</p><p>Agatha tied off the final stitch, checked the alignment, and sat back. “That should hold this time. Try not to sabotage my work again.”</p><p>“I’ll be careful,” Rio said quietly.</p><p>“Good,” Agatha replied.</p><p>When she reached for the gauze, Rio lifted her arm slightly to make it easier — not meeting Agatha’s eyes, but her movement was careful, almost considerate.</p><p>“Keep it dry for forty-eight hours,” Agatha instructed. “If it pulls again, come straight back.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Thanks, Doc.”</p><p>Her voice had that low steadiness again — unhurried, self-contained. It left no room for banter, no invitation to flirt. Just quiet sincerity.</p><p>Agatha found herself watching her longer than necessary as Wanda applied the final strip of tape.</p><p>When Rio slid off the gurney, pulling her jacket back on, Wanda’s gaze flicked between them — all knowing amusement. “Take care, Rio,” she said warmly. “We’ll see you soon, hopefully not for stitches.”</p><p>Rio gave a small nod. “Hopefully.” Then she looked once, briefly, toward Agatha. “Have a good evening.”</p><p>“You too,” Agatha said automatically.</p><p>When she was gone, Wanda turned, arms folded, that smug smile firmly in place.</p><p>“What,” Agatha said flatly.</p><p>“Nothing,” Wanda replied, her tone anything but innocent. “Just nice to see you doing hands-on follow-up care. It’s very… nurturing of you.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a cool glance. “Don’t start.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t dream of it,” Wanda said, already walking away. “Though if I were dreaming, I think I’d keep that look you had on your face just now. Very rare.”</p><p>Agatha glared after her, then exhaled through her nose.</p><p>“Teen,” she called, as she pulled off her gloves.</p><p>Her intern poked his head around the corner, eyes wide. “Yes, Doctor?”</p><p>“Clean the bay.”</p><p>“Yes, Doctor!”</p><p>He scurried in with a mop and bucket.</p><p>Agatha straightened her coat, composed again, and told herself that the faint warmth under her skin was irritation — nothing more.</p><p> </p><p>By the time the clock edged toward 8:00pm, the ER had thinned to its usual end-of-shift lull — the kind of calm that wasn’t truly calm, just the eye of the storm before night shift took over.</p><p>Agatha was finishing her last notes when Wanda appeared at her elbow, eyes wide and full of hope.</p><p>“Shift’s over,” Wanda said lightly. “You’re coming out with us.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. “Us?”</p><p>“Me, Jen, and Alice,” Wanda replied. “Drinks at The Witches’ Road. It’s tradition. You’ve survived your first full week , we should celebrate.”</p><p>Across the nurses’ station, Jen was perched on the edge of the counter, perfectly composed as always. </p><p>Her soft pink blouse was tucked into tailored slacks, gold hoops glinting under the hospital lights. Even after twelve hours on her feet, she looked editorial.</p><p>“Come on, Harkness,” Jen said, crossing one leg elegantly over the other. “A drink won’t kill you. I mean, you’ve got to loosen that spine sometime.”</p><p>“I prefer to remain upright,” Agatha replied.</p><p>From the far end of the hall, Alice, still in her paramedic uniform, waved shyly with one hand while fiddling with her radio. “We’re just going for one drink,” she said in her soft, deliberate tone. “It’s not really optional. Jen said so.”</p><p>“I don’t recall giving her authority over my schedule,” Agatha said.</p><p>“She takes it,” Wanda said with a grin. “You’ll like it there. Low lighting. Good vodka. Questionable decor.”</p><p>Agatha slipped her pen into her pocket, calm as ever. “I’ll pass.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes, though her smile stayed fond. “You’re going to have to make friends eventually, Doctor.”</p><p>“I have acquaintances,” Agatha said crisply. “That’s sufficient.”</p><p>“Mm-hm.” Wanda arched a brow. “Well, when you get tired of drinking coffee and judging humanity from a safe distance, you know where to find us.”</p><p>“Sure,” Agatha said, standing and collecting her things.</p><p>Jen smoothed the sleeve of her blush-pink blouse, adjusting the fine silk scarf at her neck. </p><p>“Your loss, Harkness. After 3 martini’s I can do a mean Adele on kareoke.”</p><p>Alice, leaning shyly against the counter in her navy paramedic jacket, blushed but smiled. “You promised you were going for one drink.”</p><p>“I did,” Jen said easily. “But my girlfriend didn’t say what size.” She reached out, brushing her fingers against Alice’s wrist, the gesture soft and fond.</p><p>Wanda grinned at them both, tucking her clipboard under her arm. “Come on, lovebirds. Let’s leave the good doctor to her paperwork and solitude.”</p><p>“Tragic,” Jen sighed dramatically. “Imagine spending a Friday night filing charts when she could be sipping gin and judging humanity from a bar stool.”</p><p>“I can judge humanity perfectly well from here,” Agatha replied without looking up.</p><p>Wanda chuckled, already pulling on her coat. “Suit yourself. One day you’ll join us and realise we’re much better entertainment than your patient reports.”</p><p>“Doubtful,” Agatha said dryly, signing the last page.</p><p>Alice offered her a small, polite smile. “Goodnight, Doctor Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Try not to end up in my ER.”</p><p>“Always the optimist,” Jen teased, looping her arm through Alice’s as they headed down the corridor.</p><p>Agatha ignored her and headed for the staff room.</p><p>They were good people. That was the trouble.<br/>
 Good people tried to get close.</p><p>The drive home was quiet, the kind of small-town stillness that made her chest ache if she thought about it too long. The roads were mostly empty, streetlights washing everything in pale amber.</p><p>Halfway down Main Street, the radio crackled to life, static giving way to the low, familiar hum of Fleetwood Mac. Something from another decade —all velvet and longing, the kind of song that knew how to fill silence without demanding too much.</p><p>By the second chorus, she realised she was humming softly, almost under her breath, the sound foreign to her own ears. </p><p>The kind of small, unguarded habit she thought she’d left behind in Boston.</p><p>When the song ended, she exhaled, switched the radio off, and let the quiet settle again.</p><p>By the time she turned onto Lilia’s street, the moon had risen pale and full over the houses, and a soft light glowed through the cottage windows.</p><p>When she stepped inside, the scent of candle wax hitt her immediately.</p><p>“Good lord,” Agatha muttered, hanging her coat by the door. “It’s a fire hazard in here.”</p><p>Lilia Calderu looked up from the dining table, where at least a dozen candles burned at different heights, wax dripping into little glass dishes. The light haloed her silver hair and glinted off the edge of a tarot deck spread in a neat crescent.</p><p>“You’d think a woman who spends her days surrounded by beeping machinery would appreciate a little atmosphere,” Lilia said.</p><p>“I’d appreciate not dying of smoke inhalation.”</p><p>“You worry too much.”</p><p>“It’s literally my profession,” Agatha said, moving to pour herself a camomile tea.</p><p>Lilia smiled. “You sound tired.”</p><p>“I am.”</p><p>“Then sit. You’re due a reading.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, but obeyed, settling into the chair opposite her. The air smelled like sage and something faintly sweet — maybe honey.</p><p>Lilia turned the top card of the deck. </p><p><strong>The Tower.</strong></p><p>Agatha eyed it. “Charming.”</p><p>“It’s not about disaster,” Lilia said, her voice soft but steady. “It’s about necessary upheaval. What falls apart to make room for truth.”</p><p>“Fitting.”</p><p>Lilia’s mouth curved. “Precisely.”</p><p>She turned another card — <strong>The Lovers</strong>, reversed.</p><p>Agatha snorted. “Oh, here we go. Is that supposed to mean I’ll never find my one true love?”</p><p>“It’s observation,” Lilia said simply. “A reminder that denial is a poor disguise for fear.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “You’ve been waiting a while to say that, haven’t you?”</p><p>“Maybe,” Lilia said, smiling. “You came here to heal, my dear. But healing doesn’t happen in isolation.”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms, looking away. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Lilia studied her for a long, quiet moment. “You always say that. You said it at ten when your mother forgot your birthday. You said it at twenty when Boston nearly broke you. You said it two weeks go when you walked through my door looking like a ghost.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing.</p><p>Finally, Lilia reached forward and flipped the third card. </p><p><strong>Temperance</strong>.</p><p>“Balance,” she murmured. “Between what you control and what you feel. That’s your lesson, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched — not quite a smile, but something near it. “You’re enjoying this far too much.”</p><p>“Only because it’s true.”</p><p>Agatha stood, brushing her hands against her slacks. “You should blow half of these candles out before bed.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “You’re a doubter.”</p><p>“And you’re combustible,” Agatha said, moving toward the stairs.</p><p>“Sleep well, my girl.”</p><p>“Mm.”</p><p>Agatha paused at the landing, glancing back. The candles flickered in the dim, their light spilling across the table — The Tower, The Lovers reversed, Temperance.</p><p>She shook her head and climbed the rest of the way up, telling herself she didn’t believe in signs.</p><p><br/>
She showered, changed, and slipped beneath the cool sheets, the faint scent of Lilia’s lavender detergennt clinging to the pillow. The cottage was silent but for the soft crackle of candles burning down somewhere below.</p><p>Sleep came slowly.</p><p>When it did, it came with the sound of sirens.</p><p>The dream unfolded in sterile white — monitors beeping, gloves snapping, her own voice echoing commands she’d said a thousand times.<br/>
<em> Clamp. Compress. Keep pressure steady</em>.</p><p>There was a child on the table. A boy.</p><p><em>Nicky</em>.</p><p>Big brown eyes, too large for his face, looking up at her as though she were something more than mortal. His lips were moving, but no sound came. Just the faint rasp of a failing breath.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” she heard herself say, the words autonmatic, desperate. “Stay with me.”</p><p>The monitors wailed. Her hands pressed harder, but her fingers slid on blood. The room blurred, light burning at the edges until she couldn’t tell where her hands ended and his skin began.</p><p>“Nicky—”</p><p>His eyes blinked once, slow and pleading. And then — impossibly — they weren’t his anymore.</p><p>They were older. Darker. Steady.</p><p>Warm brown, like the earth after rain.</p><p>Agatha froze, her breath catching. The boy’s face shifted, not in shape, but in presence. His hair darkened, his jaw sharpened, the soft curve of youth giving way to something stronger, quieter.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>The same calm gaze that had met hers in the ER, wordless and unflinching.</p><p>For a moment, the world stilled. The beeping faded. Her heartbeat filled the silence.</p><p>Then Rio spoke, not alous, but in that strange, echoing way dreams allowed.<br/>
<em> You can’t save everyone, Doctor.</em></p><p>Agatha reached for her, but her hands met nothing but light, blinding and weightless.</p><p>She gasped awake.</p><p>Her room was dark. The air smelled faintly of candle wax and sweat. The ticking of Lilia’s clock was too loud.</p><p>Agatha pressed the heel of her palm to her eyes, forcing her breathing to steady. Her throat was tight, her skin damp with sweat.</p><p>It was just a dream.<br/>
 It had been months since Nicky.<br/>
 And Rio Vidal was a firefighter with a decent pain threshold, nothing more.</p><p>She turned on her side, eyes fixed on the dim light under her door, the last flicker of candles dying somewhere downstairs.</p><p>But even as sleep crept back in, the image stayed, those same brown eyes, open and unafraid, watching her from the edge of memory.</p>

<p><br/>It was her first day off since arriving in Westview.</p><p>Lilia had insisted.</p><p>“You can’t spend your life under unnatural fluorescent lights,” she had said, shooing Agatha toward the door with a mug of tea. “Go breathe. Touch some grass. Engage with existence.”</p><p>Agatha had muttered that her existence was perfectly engaged in patient care, but Lilia only smiled that infuriating, knowing smile.</p><p>So now she was outside, walking aimlessly through a town that still didn’t feel like hers.</p><p>Westview in the spring sun looked almost picturesque. The air smelled faintly of rain and tulips, and the streets were lined with old elms and neatly painted porches. People waved as they passed. Children dragged scooters down the pavement. It was all so peaceful that Agatha found it vaguely unnerving.</p><p>After a few blocks, she found herself standing before a café called The Rabbit Hole. Its chalkboard sign promised <em>Coffee, Cakes, and Peace</em>.</p><p>She doubted the last one but went in anyway.</p><p>The bell above the door chimed softly. The air was warm, filled with the scent of espresso and sugar. She ordered a black coffee, her go to, and took a seat near the window.</p><p>It was quiet here. Gentle conversation, the low hiss of the espresso machine, and a faint hum of an old Bruce Springsteen song playing overhead.</p><p>She let herself relax, just a little.</p><p>Then she heard a familiar voice at the counter.</p><p>“Two oat lattes, please, and one of those croissants before Kate gets there first.”</p><p>Agatha looked up. Alice Wu-Gulliver stood at the counter, still in her navy paramedic uniform, her curls pinned neatly back, red flashes peeking through. She looked a little tired but content. Beside her was a younger woman with sharp dark brows, soft features, and a grin that bordered on trouble. Her name tag read Kate Bishop, EMT.</p><p>As the barista handed them their order, Kate turned and immediately spotted Agatha by the window. Her grin widened.</p><p>“Is that <em>her</em>?”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Alice followed her gaze, surprised, then smiled. “Doctor Harkness! I didn’t see you there.”</p><p>Kate nudged her lightly. “<em>The</em> Doctor Harkness? I’ve heard about you. You’re kind of a legend at the hospital already.”</p><p>Agatha took a slow sip of coffee. “Legends are usually dead.”</p><p>“Maybe that’s why you look so pale,” Kate said easily.</p><p>Alice gave her a look. “Kate.”</p><p>“What? I meant it as a compliment,” Kate said, grinning. “You’ve got this whole mystery thing going. People talk.”</p><p>Agatha blinked once. “People need hobbies.”</p><p>Alice laughed softly under her breath. “Don’t mind her, Doctor. She’s running on three hours of sleep.”</p><p>“Delirium suits her,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Kate placed a hand over her heart in mock injury. “Wow. You really are as sharp as they say.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched, not quite a smile but close enough to surprise even herself.</p><p>Alice adjusted the tray in her hands. “You missed a good night last night. The Witches’ Road was packed. Jen and Wanda dragged half the hospital staff out.”</p><p>“Sounds riveting,” Agatha said. “It seems exercised good judgment and stayed home.”</p><p>Alice smiled faintly. “Probably wise. Though you would’ve been impressed—my roommate even showed up. That almost never happens.”</p><p>“Your roommate?”</p><p>Alice nodded, a hint of amusement in her tone. “Yep. It’s rare. About as rare as seeing you outside the hospital.”</p><p>Kate laughed. “So last night was basically historic.”</p><p>Agatha stirred her coffee. “I see Westview takes its milestones seriously.”</p><p>Alice’s eyes softened. “You should come next time. It’s good for morale.”</p><p>“I have adequate morale,” Agatha said.</p><p>Kate grinned. “Of course you do.”</p><p>Their drinks were called up, and Alice turned to collect the tray. “Well, we won’t keep you. Enjoy your day off, Doctor. Lilia must be proud she got you out of the house.”</p><p>Agatha frowned slightly. “You know Lilia?”</p><p>“Everyone knows Lilia,” Alice said, as if it were obvious. “She helps at the community garden, does readings for half the town, fixes things when people are falling apart. She’s… sort of the unofficial mayor, if we’re honest.”</p><p>Agatha frowned slightly. “I see.”</p><p>Kate grinned. “Yeah, Lilia’s a legend. If you ever need something in this town, she knows who to call.”</p><p>“Fascinating,” Agatha said, though her tone made it sound anything but.</p><p>Alice adjusted the tray again. “Well, we won’t keep you. Enjoy your day off, Doctor. Tell Lilia we said hi.”</p><p>“I’ll… do that,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Kate waved. “See you around, Doc.”</p><p>The bell above the door jingled softly as they left, laughter spilling into the sunlight.</p><p>Agatha stayed for a while longer, the coffee cooling in her cup. Outside, the small town went about its quiet business.</p><p>She found herself thinking about what Alice had said — Lilia fixing things, being known. It shouldn’t have surprised her. Lilia had always had a gift for knowing people, for weaving herself into places as though she’d always belonged.</p><p>Still, Agatha couldn’t shake the faint unease that came with realising just how much of Westview seemed to orbit the woman who had raised her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The sun was low when she eventually returned to the house. The air had cooled, carrying the scent of lilacs from the garden. Through the kitchen window she saw Lilia moving about the stove, sleeves rolled up, the soft flicker of candlelight turning the small kitchen gold.</p><p>“I survived my day off,” Agatha announced, stepping inside and hanging her coat on the chair.</p><p>Lilia looked over, smiling. “You say that as if the town would attack you.”</p><p>“It nearly did. People kept trying to <em>talk</em> to me.”</p><p>“That sounds terrible,” Lilia said with mock sympathy. “Did you at least talk back?”</p><p>“Occasionally,” Agatha admitted, moving to the counter. “You’ve made quite a name for yourself in this place, by the way. Everyone seems to know you.”</p><p>“Of course they do. I’ve lived here a decade.”</p><p>Agatha picked up a loaf of bread and started slicing it, each cut precise. “They talk about you like you’re some kind of local oracle.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled, tasting the sauce. “When people don’t understand something, they give it a title. Oracle. Witch. Wise woman. It’s all the same word wearing different shoes.”</p><p>“I’m sure it’s flattering.”</p><p>“Mostly it’s exhausting,” Lilia said, setting the spoon aside. “But I listen, and people trust me. That’s all it takes.”</p><p>Agatha poured two glasses of water and leaned against the counter. “You’ve always made that sound easy.”</p><p>“It’s easy when you care.”</p><p>“That’s your mistake, then.”</p><p>Lilia gave her a patient look, the kind she’d used since Agatha was a child. “You can pretend not to, my dear, but I know better.”</p><p>Agatha said nothing.</p><p>Lilia gestured to the table. “Sit before that sharp tongue of yours curdles my sauce.”</p><p>Dinner was quiet, the air heavy with the smell of garlic and herbs. Candlelight shimmered across the plates. Outside, the sky had gone dusky blue, rain whispering faintly against the window.</p><p>After a few minutes, Lilia broke the silence. “You look lighter tonight.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Do I?”</p><p>“You do,” Lilia said simply. “Your shoulders aren’t trying to touch your ears anymore. I take that as progress.”</p><p>Agatha sighed softly, pretending to focus on her food. “You always exaggerate.”</p><p>“I just always notice,” Lilia countered gently.</p><p>They ate a little longer in companionable silence. Lilia poured tea once the plates were cleared and settled across from her, hands folded around the cup.</p><p>“This place suits you,” she said after a moment. “You might not believe it yet, but it does.”</p><p>“I didn’t come here to be suited to anything. I came here to work.”</p><p>“Working and living aren’t the same thing,” Lilia said.</p><p>“For me they are.”</p><p>“Not forever,” Lilia replied softly, a small smile touching her lips. “You’ll see.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her cup, the steam warming her face. “You’re being weirdly cryptic again.”</p><p>“I prefer the word patient.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a flat look. “You enjoy annoying me far too much.”</p><p>“I enjoy watching you pretend you don’t have a heart,” Lilia said, not unkindly.</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair. “You’re impossibly soft.”</p><p>“And you’re predictable,” Lilia said, still smiling. “Now finish your tea before it goes cold.”</p><p>Later, upstairs, Agatha paused by the window. The rain had stopped, and the town was quiet. A few lights still glowed in nearby houses, soft and domestic.</p><p>For a moment she thought she heard a siren somewhere in the distance, faint and far away. Then it faded, leaving only the sound of the wind through the trees.</p><p>She turned off the lamp and went to bed, telling herself that tomorrow would be better.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>Morning light leaked across the mirror, pale and merciless.</p><p>Agatha stared at her reflection, studying the hollows beneath her eyes, the faint grey shadows carved by too many sleepless nights. Her hair was pinned neatly, but her eyes were dull, once sharp and alive, now flat as winter glass.</p><p>She touched the edge of the sink, her knuckles whitening.<br/> “Brilliant,” she murmured at her reflection. “You <em>do</em> look half dead.”</p><p>The woman in the mirror said nothing.</p><p>Downstairs, the scent of baked cheese and herbs filled the air. She followed it to the kitchen, where Lilia was taking a bubbling lasagna out of the oven, humming under her breath.</p><p>“Please tell me that isn’t breakfast,” Agatha said, pulling her coat tighter.</p><p>“It’s lunch,” Lilia replied. “Though not ours.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Then whose?”</p><p>“The firehouse.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Firehouse?”</p><p>Lilia waved a hand as she covered the dish with foil. “I make them lunch once a month. Sometimes more if they’ve had a rough few weeks. Keeps them fed and loved.”</p><p>Agatha poured herself coffee. “They’re firefighters, not stray cats.”</p><p>“Even heroes need fed,” Lilia said lightly. “You’ll be passing by the station on your way in, won’t you? Take it for me.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her over the rim of her mug. “You want me to deliver food?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Because?”</p><p>“Because I asked” Lilia said, smiling.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “You’re too nice.”</p><p>“And you’re stubborn,” Lilia said, tucking the dish into a carry bag and pressing it into her hands. “Now go be kind. It won’t kill you.”</p><p>The Westview Fire and Rescue station stood near the edge of town, red brick against a pale morning sky. </p><p>Agatha parked, straightened her tan trench coat, and stepped inside with the lasagna balanced carefully in her arms.</p><p>The air smelled of metal and soap. Voices echoed through the open bay — low laughter, the clatter of tools, someone tuning a radio.</p><p>A tall blond man turned toward her, wiping his hands on a rag. His shirt read CPTN ROGERS.</p><p>“Can I help you, ma’am?”</p><p>“Dr. Agatha Harkness,” she said crisply. “I was told to deliver this.” She lifted the dish slightly. “From Lilia Calderu.”</p><p>His expression softened instantly. “Ah, Lilia. She’s the best. You must be her new house guest, then.”</p><p>“Reluctantly,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Steve chuckled. “We love her cooking. Tell her we’re very grateful.”</p><p>“I’ll pass it along.”</p><p>Before he could reply, another voice cut through the space.</p><p>“Well, well, if it isn’t Westview General’s very own ice queen.”</p><p>Tony Stark sauntered over, smirk firmly in place, coffee mug dangling from his fingers.</p><p>Agatha’s expression didn’t shift. ”Stark.”</p><p>“Doctor Harkness,” he said, leaning against the counter. “Back so soon? What’d we do to earn the honour?”</p><p>“I was coerced.”</p><p>“Shame,” Tony said. “You could’ve just said you missed me.”</p><p>Agatha gave him a measured look. “If I ever miss you, it’ll be because I’ve suffered a head injury.”</p><p>The firefighters around them burst into laughter. Tony winced theatrically. “You know, Doc, one day that razor tongue’s gonna cut something vital.”</p><p>“One can only hope it’s you,” she said, brushing past him to set the dish down.</p><p>Even Steve had to look away to hide his grin.</p><p>“Play nice, Stark,” he warned.</p><p>Tony held up his hands in surrender. “I’m trying! She’s just immune to charm.”</p><p>“I’m immune to bullshit,” Agatha said without looking at him.</p><p>The laughter rolled again, and Tony muttered something about “tough crowds” before retreating toward the coffee pot.</p><p>Agatha smoothed the foil on the dish, ready to leave — but her attention caught on movement across the bay.</p><p>Firefighter Vidal was loading gear into the back of a truck. Her navy shirt clung to the lines of her shoulders, short sleeves showing off tanned arms that flexed with quiet ease as she lifted a heavy hose and coiled it neatly. Her dark hair was tied back, a few strands escaping around her face.</p><p>Agatha froze before she could stop herself.</p><p>There was something hypnotic about the precision of her movements — the strength without aggression, the quiet focus. When she turned slightly, Agatha caught a glimpse of her profile, and something in her chest tightened. Calm brown eyes. That same composed stillness she remembered from the trauma bay.<br/>And then, as if sensing the stare, Rio looked up.</p><p>Their eyes met.</p><p>Agatha didn’t move, didn’t breathe. It was a heartbeat — maybe two — but it was enough. A faint, polite smile curved the Rio’s lips before she looked away, lifting the last piece of equipment into place.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse jumped. She forced herself to clear her throat and turn back to Steve, who was politely pretending not to notice.</p><p>“Well, food’s delivered,” she said briskly. “I should go.”</p><p>Steve smiled. “We appreciate it, Doctor. And Lilia too.”</p><p>Agatha gave a curt nod. “Of course.”</p><p>She walked out, heels clicking against the concrete, and didn’t allow herself to look back.</p><p>Not until she was already outside, the sunlight too bright against her eyes.</p><p>From the driver’s seat, she caught one last glimpse through the open bay doors —Rio standing by the truck, brushing a strand of hair from her face as she laughed at something one of the others said.</p><p>It wasn’t loud laughter. Just soft, shy and genuine.</p><p>Agatha started the car and pulled away, jaw set.</p><p>She told herself the tightness in her chest was irritation.</p><p>Nothing more.</p><p>But as she drove toward the hospital, her thoughts kept circling back to those steady brown eyes and the hint of warmth in them that somehow made her own reflection from that morning feel even colder.</p><p> </p><p><br/>The hospital was too quiet, again.</p><p>Not the peaceful kind of quiet — the oppressive kind that filled the hallways when the chaos stopped. </p><p>Agatha hated it. She thrived on the noise, the movement, the pulse of adrenaline that made her mind sharper than her grief could ever dull it.</p><p>Now, with the monitors humming softly and the air too still, her thoughts had too much room to breathe.</p><p>She was finishing up paperwork when she noticed Wanda Maximoff standing at the nurses’ station, unmoving, her usual brightness dimmed to a faint flicker. The nurse’s red hair had fallen from its bun, a loose strand tucked absently behind her ear. She was staring at a chart but clearly wasn’t reading it.</p><p>“You’re quiet,” Agatha said, her tone more clipped than concerned. “That’s unnatural for you.”</p><p>Wanda blinked, startled, then smiled faintly. “oh, just thinking.”</p><p>“About what?”</p><p>“Nothing good,” Wanda admitted, her voice soft. “It’s the anniversary of my brother’s death. Three years today.”</p><p>Agatha froze, pen hovering above the page. She hadn’t expected that kind of honesty. Most people hid grief behind chatter. Wanda offered hers like a confession.</p><p>“I see,” Agatha said after a moment, her voice quieter than usual. “I didn’t know.”</p><p>Wanda shook her head. “You couldn’t have. He died suddenly. Some days I still feel like I’ll turn a corner and find him there. Silly, isn’t it?”</p><p>“Not at all.” Agatha set down her pen. “Loss does that. It tricks the mind into waiting for someone it already knows is gone.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyes lifted to hers, faintly wet but calm. “That’s… exactly it.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged lightly, as if trying to diminish her own words. “You learn to live with the echoes. They never quite fade.”</p><p>For a moment, neither of them spoke. The low hum of machines filled the space between them.</p><p>Then Wanda smiled faintly, the expression tired but genuine. “You know, you’re a good friend, Agatha.”</p><p>The word hit like a sudden drop in pressure.</p><p>Friend.</p><p>Her breath caught — so fast she almost didn’t notice it until her throat ached.<br/> She hadn’t heard that word used for her in years. Not since—<br/><em>Nicky</em>.</p><p>The boy with the fragile heart and bright smile. The one who’d looked up at her with wide brown eyes and said, <em>You’re my friend, right, Dr. Harkness</em>?<br/> She had promised him she was.</p><p>And then she’d lost him.</p><p>Her chest constricted. The room blurred at the edges.</p><p>“Excuse me,” she said abruptly, voice steady but thin.</p><p>Wanda blinked, concerned. “Agatha? Are you—”</p><p>“I have charts to finish,” she said quickly, already turning away. “You should take your break.”</p><p>Before Wanda could answer, Agatha walked off, her heels echoing down the hallway, sharp and fast.</p><p>She didn’t stop until she reached the supply room — quiet, dim, blessedly empty.</p><p>She leaned against the counter, pressing a hand to her sternum as if she could physically hold herself together. Her eyes burned, but she refused to let them fall.</p><p>Friend.</p><p>It was such a small word. Such a simple, devastating thing.</p><p>After a moment, she drew in a deep breath, straightened her coat, and forced herself back to composure. <br/>When she stepped out again, no trace of it showed — just the familiar, cool precision of Dr. Harkness.</p><p>But all through the rest of her shift, the echo of that word followed her. Not as pain exactly. Something closer to remembering.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Agatha arrived home, the sky had dimmed to the colour of cooling embers. The air smelled faintly of lilacs and wood smoke, the kind of soft domestic peace she never quite knew what to do with.</p><p>Inside, the cottage was warm. Too warm.</p><p>Lilia was at the stove, stirring something fragrant, saffron, garlic, white wine. “You’re home late,” she said without turning.</p><p>“Busy day,” Agatha murmured, setting her bag on the counter. “Don’t wait up. I’m not hungry.”</p><p>Lilia gave the pan one last stir before glancing over her shoulder. “I made risotto.”</p><p>“I noticed,” Agatha said, loosening her collar. “It won’t help.”</p><p>“Nothing helps if you refuse to sit still long enough for it to.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Lilia—”</p><p>“I know,” she interrupted gently. “You don’t want to talk. You don’t want to eat. You want to hide.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Something like that.”</p><p>“Then go on,” Lilia said, sighing lightly. “Sulk away.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes and turned toward the stairs. “Goodnight.”</p><p>She’d only made it a few steps up when a knock sounded at the door.</p><p>Lilia’s head lifted, eyes narrowing for half a second before her whole face softened. “Ah,” she murmured, already wiping her hands. “Right on time.”</p><p>“Who—” Agatha began, but Lilia had already opened the door.</p><p>And there she was.</p><p>Rio Vidal stood on the porch, her dark hair pulled back loosely, a faint sheen of fatigue softening the angles of her face. She still wore her navy Fire &amp; Rescue jacket, one hand holding a glass dish — the lasagna tray from that morning.</p><p>“Hey Lil,” Rio said quietly. “I just came to return this. I didn’t want it sitting in my car overnight.”</p><p>Lilia’s smile widened, kind but not surprised. “Oh Rio, you’re far too polite. You could’ve brought it tomorrow.”</p><p>“I was passing anyway,” Rio said. “Didn’t mean to interrupt.”</p><p>“You’re not interrupting,” Lilia said. “You’re saving me from eating this risotto alone.” She pulled at Rio’s free hand.</p><p>“Oh, I couldn’t—”</p><p>“Of course you could,” Lilia said, already stepping back to let her in. “One bowl won’t hurt.”</p><p>Rio hesitated. “I don’t want to impose.”</p><p>From the stairs, Agatha’s voice cut through, sharper than intended. “She’s right — you should stay.”</p><p>Both women turned.</p><p>Agatha was standing halfway down the steps, one hand on the banister, pretending indifference even as her pulse picked up.</p><p>Lilia hid her smile. “I thought you weren’t hungry, dear.”</p><p>Agatha descended the rest of the way with what she hoped was dignity. “Well I changed my mind. You know I hate when food goes to waste.”</p><p>“Convenient timing,” Lilia said, voice mild but glinting with amusement. “Well, that settles it.”</p><p>She ushered Rio toward the kitchen. “Take off your jacket. Sit down. I’ll grab another plate.”</p><p>Rio looked a little uncertain but obeyed, carefully folding her jacket over the back of a chair. She moved quietly, as though afraid to take up too much space.</p><p>Agatha poured herself water, acutely aware of her own movements, of the warmth in the air, of the faint scent of smoke clinging to Rio’s sleeves.</p><p>Lilia set three plates on the table and served with practiced ease. “So Rio,” she said casually, “how’s work been this week?”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “Quiet. That’s not always a good thing, but it’s nice for a change.”</p><p>“Agatha doesn’t like quiet,” Lilia said.</p><p>Agatha gave her a look. “I like being busy.”</p><p>“That’s not what I said,” Lilia replied, taking her seat.</p><p>Rio’s mouth quirked. “I think I understand what she means, though. Sometimes you need the noise. It keeps you grounded.”</p><p>Agatha paused mid-bite, studying her. “Exactly.”</p><p>Rio met her eyes briefly, then ducked her head, as if embarrassed by the connection.</p><p>The conversation drifted gently after that — work, the weather, small absurdities about Westview life. Rio spoke little but with thoughtfulness, and when she laughed — soft, shy, genuine — something in Agatha’s chest loosened.</p><p>Lilia, ever the observer, kept her tone easy and her comments benign, but her eyes missed nothing. She noticed how Agatha leaned forward slightly when Rio spoke, how Rio’s voice grew steadier the longer Agatha listened. The rhythm between them was subtle, quiet, but alive.</p><p>When the plates were empty, Lilia rose to pour the wine. “You’ll stay for a glass?” she asked.</p><p>Rio hesitated. “Oh— uh— Just one.”</p><p>“One’s how it starts,” Lilia teased, and poured anyway.</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly. “She says that like it’s sinister.”</p><p>“It is,” Lilia said with a wink. “In moderation.”</p><p>She poured a little more wine into each of their glasses, then clapped her hands as if suddenly remembering something. “Ah! I nearly forgot — I promised Sharon I’d give her a reading tonight.”</p><p>Agatha froze, mid-sip. “Who’s Sharon?”</p><p>“My neighbour,” Lilia said cheerfully, already untying her apron. “She’s been in a mood all week; the cards might help.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “You’re leaving <em>now</em>?”</p><p>Lilia grabbed her shawl from the hook by the door. “It’s only next door, dear. You’ll survive without me for half an hour.”</p><p>“Convenient timing,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“I prefer <em>divine</em>,” Lilia said with a mischievous smile. “Enjoy the rest of the wine, you two.”</p><p>The front door shut behind her, and silence bloomed in her wake.</p><p>Rio looked slightly startled, glancing toward the door and then back to Agatha. “Should I—?”</p><p>“No, stay,” Agatha said before she could stop herself. Her tone came out sharper than intended, so she added, softer, “She’ll only chase you down the street if you try to leave.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly. “You’re probably right.”</p><p>Agatha sat back in her chair, trying to appear indifferent, though she could feel the warmth rising in her chest. The candlelight between them flickered, catching on Rio’s features — the slope of her cheek, the faint gap between her top teeth when she smiled, the way her eyes seemed to hold more light than the flame itself.</p><p>“So,” Agatha said, more to fill the silence than anything. “How long have you lived in Westview?”</p><p>“Almost five years,” Rio said, tracing a fingertip along the stem of her glass. “Moved here after my abeuela passed. Needed a fresh start.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “And you found one?”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “Mostly. It’s a quiet town, but the people are good. It’s the kind of place that keeps you, even when you think you might leave.”</p><p>Agatha hummed softly. “I’m not convinced that’s a good thing.”</p><p>“For some people, maybe not,” Rio said, meeting her gaze. “But sometimes staying still can be its own kind of courage.”</p><p>The words caught Agatha off guard. She looked away, pretending to adjust her glass. “You’re oddly philosophical for someone who runs into burning buildings.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly. “You think we don’t have time to think in there?”</p><p>“I think most people prefer not to.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio said. “But when everything’s on the line, you learn to see what matters pretty quickly.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened — the echo of Nicky’s voice, of hospital monitors, of losses she couldn’t forget. <br/>She masked it behind a sip of wine. “And what matters?”</p><p>Rio studied her for a long moment before answering. “Connection. People who see you. It doesn’t happen often, but when it does, you don’t forget it.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “That sounds dangerously sentimental.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Doesn’t make it untrue.”</p><p>Silence settled between them again, softer this time. The air hummed faintly with the sound of the clock in the next room and the low murmur of the kettle Lilia must’ve left on.</p><p>Agatha surprised herself by relaxing into it. She wasn’t good at quiet — it usually pressed in on her, made her restless — but this was different. It wasn’t empty. It felt… steady.</p><p>Safe.</p><p>Rio broke the silence first, her voice gentle. “You’re not what I expected.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Meaning?”</p><p>“You’ve got quite a reputation at the hospital already,” Rio said, her tone careful but teasing. “Tough. Unshakable. The kind of doctor who could probably perform surgery during an earthquake.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “All accurate so far.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened. “But I think there’s more underneath.”</p><p>“Don’t psychoanalyse me, Vidal. It won’t end well.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Rio said, still smiling. “Just… observing.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched, unwillingly amused. “Observation is a dangerous habit.”</p><p>“Then we’ve got that in common,” Rio replied.</p><p>Something about the way she said it — calm, certain — disarmed Agatha completely. She felt herself soften, the edges of her defences blurring without permission.</p><p>When Lilia finally returned, humming softly to herself, she paused in the doorway.</p><p>Agatha was still sitting at the table. Rio was laughing — not shyly this time, but easily, her whole face lit with it. Agatha’s head was tipped slightly, her expression unguarded in a way Lilia hadn’t seen in years.</p><p>Lilia’s eyes glimmered, but she said nothing. She simply slipped off her shawl and began tidying the counter as if she hadn’t noticed anything at all.</p><p>When Rio stood to leave a few minutes later, she thanked them both for dinner again. Her voice was softer now, but brighter somehow too.</p><p>Agatha walked her to the door — out of politeness, she told herself — and when Rio smiled and said, “Goodnight, Doctor,” something in Agatha’s chest gave a quiet, unfamiliar flutter.</p><p>After the door closed, Lilia spoke without turning around. “You seemed to get on well.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “Don’t start.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Lilia said, stacking plates. “I don’t need to. Your smile says enough.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly. “You’re deluded.”</p><p>“And you,” Lilia said gently, “are changing.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She simply gathered the glasses and washed them in silence, pretending not to notice how steady her heartbeat felt — and how long it had been since she’d felt safe enough to let it slow.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p><br/>The next few days passed with an irritating lack of logic.</p><p>Agatha threw herself into work the way she always did — precision, structure, control.<br/> Charts balanced. Patients stabilised. Everything in its proper place.</p><p>And yet…<br/>Every so often, she’d find her thoughts slipping.<br/> A voice in her memory — low, steady, patient.<br/><em> Sometimes staying still can be its own kind of courage.</em></p><p>She’d dismiss it immediately, of course. Ridiculous sentimentality. The kind of thing that belonged to people who took comfort in candlelight and wine.</p><p>But then, she’d look up from a chart and catch herself staring at the ER doors — as if half-expecting someone in a navy Fire &amp; Rescue jacket to walk through.</p><p>Why the fuck was she so affected by this woman?</p><p>“Doctor?”</p><p>She blinked. William — <em>Teen</em> — her intern, was standing by the nurses’ station, holding a chart upside down. “You were, uh… somewhere else for a second.”</p><p>“I was thinking about our triage protocols,” Agatha said crisply.</p><p>“Right,” Teen said, unconvinced. “Totally looked like that.”</p><p>Before she could respond, Wanda’s voice carried from across the station. “Teen, stop pestering the doctor. You’ll give her an aneurysm.”</p><p>“I’m just learning!”</p><p>“Learn quietly,” Agatha muttered, taking the chart from him.</p><p>Wanda grinned, setting a coffee on the counter beside her. “He’s right, though. You’ve been a little… different this week.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. “Define different.”</p><p>“Less terrifying.”</p><p>“That sounds like defamation.”</p><p>“Mm,” Wanda said, sipping her coffee. “If I didn’t know better, I’d think someone’s been having dinners with interesting company.”</p><p>Agatha’s pen paused mid-signature. “You people gossip like oxygen is optional.”</p><p>Wanda smiled into her cup. “It’s Westview, doctor. We live for gossip.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, forcing her hand to stay steady. “There is nthing to gossip about. Lilia had company, I happened to exist in the same room, and that’s the entire story.”</p><p>Wanda hummed. “Of course.”</p><p>She turned to leave, tossing over her shoulder, “By the way, Romanoff wants you and Dr. Kale to report to the training field tomorrow. Annual trauma simulation.”</p><p>Agatha’s head lifted. “The what?”</p><p>“The disaster drill,” Wanda said, grinning. “Fire, police, EMS, and hospital staff all playing nice together. You will love it.”</p><p>“I’m sure.”</p><p>When she walked away, Agatha stood for a moment, the hospital noise closing in again- monitors beeping, phones ringing, the usual rhythm of work.<br/> And still, beneath it, something quieter pulsed.</p><p>Not distraction, exactly.<br/> Just… warmth.</p><p>She hated that she didn’t hated it.</p><p><br/>The next morning, the hospital parking lot buzzed with the low hum of engines and conversation.<br/> Dr. Natasha Romanoff stood beside an SUV, clipboard in hand, her red hair pulled back into a no-nonsense braid.</p><p>“Morning, team,” she said. “You both look thrilled.”</p><p>“I was under the impression doctors treat disasters,” Agatha said. “Not create them.”</p><p>Natasha smirked. “Consider it character building.”</p><p>Jen Kale arrived seconds later, sunglasses perched on her head, dressed far too well for a simulation. “Do we at least get lunch out of this?”</p><p>“Catered sandwiches courtesy of The Rabbit Hole ,” Natasha said dryly. “Dont get too excited.”</p><p>They drove out to the field on the edge of town where the annual emergency drill was already underway. <br/>Fire engines gleamed under the sun, mock victims lay across the grass, and the air buzzed with staged urgency.</p><p>Jen groaned as she took in the scene. “This is going to be chaos.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved faintly. “Finally.”</p><p>When Natasha handed out assignments, Jen was sent to the EMS team. Agatha’s name, however, was paired neatly beside one of the fire units.</p><p>She scanned the list, one brow rising. “Of course,” she muttered. “Fate’s sense of humour again.”</p><p>She turned and there she was.</p><p>Rio stood near one of the trucks, hair pulled back, sunlight catching the faint sheen of sweat along her temples. She looked calm, focused, more grounded than anyone else around her.</p><p>Their eyes met across the crowd with a small flicker of recognition and Agatha’s stomach gave a traitorous twist.</p><p>Rio offered a polite, shy smile. “Morning, Doctor.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, tone even. “Firefighter Vidal.”</p><p>“Looks like we’re partners,” Rio said softly.</p><p>“Apparently,” Agatha replied.</p><p>The training field was now already alive with motion. Fire crews, EMTs, and hospital staff moved like clockwork, the sound of clanking metal and simulated chaos filling the air.</p><p>Agatha adjusted her gloves, scanning the wrecked cars. “Remarkably realistic,” she murmured. “Right down to the melodrama.”</p><p>Captain Rogers briefed the teams. “Remember, people, communication and coordination are everything. You treat this like it’s real.”</p><p>Beside Agatha, Rio crouched to inspect one of the vehicles. </p><p>“Door’s jammed,” she said, voice calm. “We’ll need the spreader.”</p><p>“Go ahead,” Agatha said briskly, crouching to check the ‘victim’s’ vitals. “I’ll handle the patient’s airway.”</p><p>Rio moved with quiet confidence, slipping the jaws of the hydraulic tool beneath the crumpled metal. The machine whined, the door shuddered—and then, with a sharp <em>crack,</em> it flew open.</p><p>Straight into Agatha’s shin.</p><p>“Fuck—Ow!” she hissed, staggering back.</p><p>Rio looked up, horrified. “Shit—are you okay?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, voice taut. “Yes. Perfectly fine. My leg, however, may never forgive you.”</p><p>Before Rio could respond, the dummy’s arm suddenly detached at the shoulder and rolled into Agatha’s lap.</p><p>There was a beat of silence.</p><p>Agatha looked down at the severed limb. Then up at Rio.</p><p>Rio froze, mouth falling open. “Fuck. That’s… not supposed to happen.”</p><p>“I should really hope not,” Agatha said dryly, holding the arm up by its sleeve. “Our patient appears to have suffered spontaneous dismemberment.”</p><p>Tony Stark’s voice carried from the next simulation bay. “Having some performance issues over there Vidal?”</p><p>Agatha glared. “Fuck off Stark.”</p><p>Rio was already scrambling to reattach the arm, cheeks flushed. “I swear this dummy was intact five minutes ago when I set up.”</p><p>“That’s disarming,” Agatha said without thinking. Then she paused, realising what she’d said.</p><p>Rio blinked. “Did you just—”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quickly. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>Rio smirked. “You did.”</p><p>“I did not.”</p><p>“You made a pun.”</p><p>“I <em>detest</em> puns.”</p><p>But Rio was laughing now, shoulders shaking as she tried to reattach the limb, and then—because the universe had a sense of timing—the dummy’s head slipped loose and rolled right between Agatha’s sneakers.</p><p>For a moment, neither of them moved.</p><p>The fake eyes stared up at her, painted and lifeless. The silence stretched—and then Agatha, against every instinct she possessed, started laughing.</p><p>At first it was just a breath—sharp, incredulous—but then Rio looked at her with that wide-eyed mortification, and the laugh broke free completely.</p><p>It rolled out of her, helpless and loud, the kind she hadn’t let herself have in years.</p><p>Rio’s laughter joined hers instantly—low, breathless, completely unrestrained. She leaned against the car for balance, wiping at her eyes. “Well. <em>He’s</em> certainly not keeping it together.”</p><p>“Call psych, he’s got some screws loose,” Agatha gasped, tears forming at the corners of her eyes.</p><p>“Call time of death more like,” Rio wheezed. </p><p>By now, several onlookers had turned to stare. Captain Rogers and Chief Romanoff approached, expressions caught somewhere between disbelief and mild panic.</p><p>“Doctor Harkness?” Natasha said. “Lieutenant Vidal?”</p><p>Agatha tried to compose herself, but another fit of laughter broke through. “Our patient—” she began, pointing helplessly at the dummy, “—has expired due to… complete anatomical failure?”</p><p>Rio was doubled over beside her, shaking with laughter.</p><p>Steve looked at Natasha. “Is this… normal?”</p><p>Natasha pinched the bridge of her nose. “No. No, it is<em> not</em>.”</p><p>She turned back to them, tone deadpan. “You’re aware this is a professional exercise, not a comedy routine?”</p><p>Agatha straightened, still fighting a grin. “With respect, Chief, the patient started it.”</p><p>Rio nodded solemnly. “He just fell apart under pressure.”</p><p>That did it. They both dissolved again, laughing so hard Rio had to lean against Agatha’s shoulder for balance.</p><p>Steve muttered, “I’ve never seen either of them crack before.”</p><p>Natasha sighed. “God help me, I kind of like it.”</p><p>When they finally composed themselves—barely—Agatha wiped her eyes and exhaled. “Well. That was undignified.”</p><p>Rio was still smiling, breathless and flushed. “Best drill ever.”</p><p>“Remind me to request a sturdier patient next time,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Tehnically, I picked this one,” Rio countered, her tone teasing but soft.</p><p>Natasha crossed her arms. “You two are aware your patient is now technically missing a head?”</p><p>“Don’t worry,” Agatha said smoothly. “I dont think he’ll file a suit.”</p><p>Steve coughed to hide a laugh, earning him a glare from Natasha.</p><p>But as they turned to brief the next team, Agatha caught the faintest smile flickering at the edge of Natasha’s mouth.</p><p>Agtha glanced back at Rio, their eyes met, both still shining with laughter, and something warm flickered between them.</p><p>Across the field, Jen Kale caught sight of them. Agatha, of all people, was laughing with her head tipped back and her guard completely down. Jen smirked, raising an eyebrow as if to say well, well.</p><p>When Agatha’s gaze flicked her way, she gave an exaggerated thumbs-up before turning back to her own team, looking far too pleased with herself.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the small smile didn’t leave her face.</p><p>When Natasha and Steve turned away to brief the next group, the world seemed to shrink again until it was just the two of them standing in the soft aftermath of shared chaos.</p><p>They crouched to gather the dummy’s scattered limbs, both still stifling the occasional laugh. When Agatha reached for an arm at the same moment as Rio, their fingers brushed. It was warm, brief, but enough to send a flutter through her chest.</p><p>Rio’s laughter faded into a quieter smile. “Guess we make a pretty good team.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, really looked, and for a moment the noise of the crowd and the smell of smoke and melted plastic all disappeared.</p><p>For the first time in a very long time, she felt completely, stupidly, wonderfully alive.</p><p><br/>—————————</p><p> </p><p>The following evening, the ER was mercifully quiet — not still, but steady, humming with the rhythm Agatha liked best.</p><p>A few sprains. A mild concussion. One teenager pretending to faint for attention.</p><p>After the chaos of the disaster drill, the predictability was almost soothing.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>Every now and then, her mind would flicker back to the field, to the sound of Rio’s laughter, to the absurd sight of a decapitated dummy rolling between her boots. The way her own laughter had spilled out unrestrained, shocking her as much as everyone else.</p><p>The memory tugged a smile from her that she immediately schooled back into neutrality when she realised Wanda was watching her from across the nurses’ station.</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha warned without looking up from her chart.</p><p>“Didn’t say anything,” Wanda replied, too casually.</p><p>Jen sauntered up beside her, perfect lipstick, cheeks gleaming, ID badge artfully tilted. “You’re smiling at paperwork. That’s new.”</p><p>“I was remembering how peaceful it is when you two aren’t here.”</p><p>Jen tilted her head, grin sharp. “Or maybe you were remembering the firefighter you couldn’t stop laughing with at the disaster drill.”</p><p>Wanda perked up immediately. “Oh? What firefighter?”</p><p>Jen looked delighted. “You should’ve seen it. Agatha and the mysterious Rio, making each other laugh like it was a rom-com. I thought they’d been body-snatched.”</p><p>“I was <em>laughing at a dummy losing its head</em>,” Agatha cut in flatly.</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Jen said. “And smiling like one too.”</p><p>Wanda’s brows rose, eyes bright with interest. “Doctor Harkness, are you fraternising with first responders?”</p><p>“Absolutely not,” Agatha said, snapping the chart closed with more force than necessary. “And if this conversation continues, I’ll start assigning both of you to overnight intake.”</p><p>Jen pressed her lips together, barely suppressing a grin. “Touchy.”</p><p>Wanda leaned toward her and whispered, “Definitely touchy.”</p><p>Agatha’s glare silenced them both. “If you’re finished gossiping, some of us are trying to maintain a functioning department.”</p><p>Wanda bit back a smile. “Of course, Doctor.”</p><p>Jen winked at Wanda. “Anyway, we’re still going out tonight — The Witches’ Road. You should come this time.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look up. “No.”</p><p>Jen leaned an elbow on the counter. “Come on, Doctor Doom. You’re due for some serotonin.”</p><p>“I have no interest in public intoxication or loud noises.”</p><p>“That’s what you said last time,” Wanda said. “And look how well that turned out.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a flat look. “Last time I declined.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Wanda said brightly. “So tonight, try something radical— say yes.”</p><p>Jen tilted her head, smiling in that disarming way that made it hard to argue. “We’ll even behave. Scout’s honour.”</p><p>“Neither of you were scouts.”</p><p>“Irrelevant,” Jen said.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to refuse again—<br/> and then, for reasons she couldn’t entirely explain, she stopped.</p><p>Maybe it was the lingering lightness from the day before.<br/> Maybe it was the way her body still remembered what it felt like to laugh until her ribs hurt.<br/> Or maybe it was just the thought of going home to silence and knowing Lilia would read her like an open book the moment she walked through the door, lecturing her again about spending her nights with an old kooky lady.</p><p>She exhaled, slow and deliberate. “Fine.”</p><p>Wanda blinked. “Wait— fine as in yes?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said briskly, as if speed would make it less monumental. “I’ll come. One drink.”</p><p>Jen’s grin was immediate and gleeful. “Oh, this is historic.”</p><p>“Don’t make it a thing,” Agatha said, signing off a chart. “I’ll regret it instantly.”</p><p>“Too late,” Wanda said, already texting. “We’re celebrating.”</p><p>“Celebrating what?”</p><p>“You saying yes,” Wanda said, tucking her phone away. “The world might end tomorrow, so we’re making the most of it.”</p><p>Agatha muttered something about melodrama but didn’t protest.</p><p>When her shift ended, she found herself outside The Witches’ Road an hour later, the spring night air warm against her skin. The windows glowed amber, laughter spilling out into the street.</p><p>She paused before entering, taking a slow breath. She had dressed in her usual crisp white button down tucked into high-waisted plum trousers, her hair still pinned up from work and her navy trench coat slung over her shoulders.</p><p>Inside, Wanda, Kate and Jen were already at a corner table, waving her over.</p><p>“Doctor Harkness!” Wanda called, mock-formal. “You came!”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but smiled lightly as she made her way over.</p><p>“Don’t make a scene,” she said.</p><p>“Too late,” Jen said, sliding a glass toward her. “To new beginnings, Doctor.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, then raised her glass. “To questionable decisions.”</p><p>Jen set her drink down with a satisfied sigh. “We’re just waiting on Alice and her roommate, then we can properly start.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Roommate?”</p><p>Jen smiled over the rim of her glass. “You’ll see.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, the door to The Witches’ Road swung open, letting in the soft spill of night air and laughter from the street.</p><p>Alice stepped in first, cheeks pink from the cold, her usual shy smile brightening instantly when she spotted Jen. Beside her came another figure — taller, shoulders squared under a worn black denim jacket.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Firefighter Rio Vidal.</p><p>Gone was the uniform and the heavy air of duty. Tonight she looked… impossibly human.</p><p>Her dark hair was loose, falling in soft waves around her face. The collar of her green cropped T-shirt dipped just enough to reveal the faint glint of a chain against tanned skin and her defined abdomen was hard to look away from. There was a casual strength in her posture — calm, self-contained — that drew Agatha’s eyes before she could stop herself.</p><p>Her pulse skipped, traitorous and immediate.</p><p>Alice waved as she and Rio made their way over. </p><p>“Sorry we’re late! She wasn’t going to come until she heard a certain doct—”</p><p>Before she could finish, Rio clapped a hand over her mouth, eyes wide. “Al.”</p><p>Alice blinked, muffled against Rio’s palm. “—ctor was going to be here,” she finished weakly once Rio let go.</p><p>Jen’s grin was instant. “Oh, this just got interesting.”</p><p>Rio groaned under her breath, cheeks pink. “Ignore her. She was dropped as an infant.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was perfectly even. “I’m sure.”</p><p>She returned her gaze to her drink, forcing her pulse to slow. It was ridiculous to react at all — it was a harmless comment, a throwaway tease between friends.</p><p>Still, her mind replayed it in spite of herself.<br/><em> She wasn’t going to come until she heard a certain doctor was going to be here.</em></p><p>Her throat felt suddenly dry.</p><p>It could mean nothing. People said things like that all the time. Perhaps Alice had meant another doctor entirely. Perhaps it was just a joke. That was the logical explanation.</p><p>And yet, logic did nothing to steady the small, traitorous spark of warmth that had settled low in her chest.</p><p>She shifted in her seat, schooling her expression into neutrality. “I assume this level of gossip is normal for your town,” she said lightly, tone clipped.</p><p>Rio rubbed at the back of her neck, looking mortified. “Unfortunately, yes.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, as if that settled it, though her stomach still felt weightless and strange.</p><p>Wanda leaned back, the corners of her mouth twitching like she could feel the air between them shift.</p><p>Agatha focused on the condensation sliding down her glass instead, pretending not to notice the faint, shy smile Rio gave her from across the table.</p><p>Wanda leaned back in her chair, the corners of her mouth twitching. “Well you made it! Perfect timing. The doctor was just starting to enjoy herself.”</p><p>Agatha gave her a sharp look. “Don’t start.”</p><p>She could feel Wanda watching her, the faintest smirk tugging at her mouth.</p><p>The others shifted to make room, and by some cruel twist of fate, the only open seat was directly across from Agatha.</p><p>Rio slid into it, shoulders relaxed, movements unhurried. </p><p>Conversation resumed easily around them. Kate was recounting a story about a disastrous double date, Alice blushing at Jen’s laughter, Wanda stirring her drink as if she were mixing a potion.</p><p>Agatha contributed when necessary — precise, polite — but her attention drifted.<br/> To the way Rio’s hand rested lightly on the table, fingertips tapping the rim of her glass.<br/> To the softness of her voice when she spoke, low and deliberate, as if everything she said was worth listening to.<br/> To the unassuming steadiness that seemed to centre the entire table without her even trying.</p><p>Wanda noticed. Of course she did.</p><p>Halfway through the evening, Agatha caught her watching — that infuriating, all-knowing smile curving at the corners of her mouth. The one she used when she’d spotted a secret before anyone else.</p><p>Agatha met her eyes briefly, a silent warning. <em>Don’t start</em>.</p><p>Wanda innocently lifted her glass in a mock toast as if to say, <em>Who, me</em>?</p><p>Across the table, Rio looked up at that exact moment, meeting Agatha’s gaze.<br/> A flicker, brief, quiet, charged passed between them. Neither spoke. Neither smiled. Just a pulse of recognition that felt like the world narrowing, for one heartbeat, to the space between them.</p><p>Then the moment broke. Jen was teasing Alice about her driving, Kate was ordering another round, and Rio was turning her attention back to the conversation- though not before Agatha saw the faintest colour bloom at the tips of her ears.</p><p>Agatha busied herself with her drink, taking a steady sip to cover the way her breath had caught.<br/>She could feel Wanda’s grin without even looking up.</p><p>When she finally risked a glance across the table, Rio was laughing quietly at something Kate had said, her face soft in the amber light.</p><p>And Agatha — cool, precise, self-contained Agatha — felt something uncoil gently inside her.</p><p>It wasn’t attraction exactly, not yet.<br/> It was the strange, rare comfort of being drawn to someone without meaning to.</p><p>The kind of pull you didn’t fight, because it didn’t feel dangerous.<br/> Not yet.</p><p>She reminded herself that she wasn’t here for romance, or love, or anything that could pull her off balance again. She couldn’t afford it. Not after Boston. Not after Nicky. Not after everything she’d built back from.</p><p>Feelings were a luxury she no longer trusted herself with.</p><p>So she took another sip of her drink, straightened her shoulders, and quietly rebuilt her composure — brick by careful brick — while Rio’s laughter drifted across the table like a melody she refused to learn by heart.</p><p><br/>As the night wore on easily, conversation looping through laughter and anecdotes that blurred together with the music. Wanda was telling an exaggerated story about her first week in the ER, complete with hand gestures and terrible impressions while Jen laughed along at the memory.</p><p>Kate and Alice were deep in some debate about their worst patient stories, their voices soft and companionable.<br/> For once, Agatha found herself… content.<br/> There was no pressure to speak, no eyes on her for answers. The noise was steady, familiar. Human.<br/>She leaned back slightly, letting herself breathe.</p><p>Across the table, Rio was quiet, but not withdrawn, listening with that easy attentiveness that seemed to steady everyone around her. </p><p>When Wanda’s story finally dissolved into laughter, Rio turned her glass absently between her hands and looked across the table.</p><p>“How’s your leg?” she asked suddenly.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “My—what?”</p><p>“Your shin,” Rio said, her lips curving just enough to be teasing. “From the drill. The door got you pretty good.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched. “You mean when your equipment<em> attacked</em> me?”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, mock-serious. “I prefer the term <em>malfunctioned under duress</em>.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “A charming euphemism for clumsiness.”</p><p>That earned her a low laugh, soft but genuine. “You’re not limping, so I’ll assume you survived.”</p><p>“Barely,” Agatha said dryly. “I’ve filed emotional damages paperwork.”</p><p>“Good,” Rio said, eyes glinting. “I’ll be sure to sign my confession.”</p><p>The corner of Agatha’s mouth lifted — that same unguarded expression she hadn’t quite managed to suppress since the disaster drill. “See that you do.”</p><p>Their eyes held for a moment longer than was proper, long enough for Wanda, sipping her drink beside Jen, to notice and glance between them with barely contained amusement.</p><p>Rio looked away first, ducking her head slightly, fingers tracing the rim of her glass. “You laugh easier than I expected,” she said, almost to herself.</p><p>Agatha frowned faintly. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“At the drill,” Rio said, still not looking up. “You seem like the kind of person who doesn’t let go of control easily. But when you laughed…” she smiled, small and soft, “it felt like the air changed.”</p><p>Agatha felt the words land somewhere she didn’t want to examine. “It was a ridiculous situation,” she said carefully.</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio murmured. “Still, it was nice to hear.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Wanda leaned forward from where she sat beside Jen, chin resting on her hand, eyes glinting with mischief.</p><p>“Well, would you look at that,” she said lightly. “I’ve never seen you smile that much, Rio.”</p><p>Rio blinked, startled out of her quiet focus. “What?”</p><p>Wanda’s grin widened. “You. Smiling. It’s new. You’re usually the quiet, brooding type — makes half the nurses nervous and the other half curious.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flushed a soft pink. “I… didn’t realise I had a reputation.”</p><p>“Oh, you do,” Wanda said, teasing but kind. “Silent, mysterious, perpetually leaning against doorframes. You’ve got the whole thing down.”</p><p>Across the table, Jen laughed. “She’s right. You’ve got a very ‘tragic firefighter’ aesthetic.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth quirked. “I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>Agatha, who had been perfectly still through the exchange, finally said, “Perhaps people smile more when they’re allowed a break from relentless commentary.”</p><p>Wanda shot her a look over the rim of her glass. “Touché, Doctor.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze flickered toward Agatha then — not teasing, not embarrassed, just quiet amusement. “I’ll admit,” she said softly, “this is a better kind of attention.”</p><p>For a moment, Agatha didn’t breathe.</p><p>It was the way Rio said it — low, unguarded, entirely sincere — that caught her off balance. Something in her chest shifted, a tug she didn’t recognise. Warmth spread where logic usually lived, and the sudden awareness of it made her spine go rigid.</p><p>No. Absolutely not.</p><p>She could feel Wanda watching her from across the table, that damned perceptive calm in her eyes, and the weight of it made Agatha’s pulse quicken. She set down her glass a little too carefully, stood, and reached for her bag.</p><p>“I should go,” she said, her tone brisdk. “Early rounds tomorrow.”</p><p>Wanda blinked. “You just got here.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Agatha said. “And I’ve met my social quota for the month.”</p><p>She didn’t look at Rio as she turned to leave, but she could feel the firefighter’s gaze follow her — steady, questioning. It made her skin prickle.</p><p>The cool night air hit her like a shock when she stepped outside. She inhaled sharply, eyes closing for a moment. The air smelled faintly of rain and smoke, and beneath it, something softer she didn’t want to name.</p><p>She told herself to walk, to move, to not think.</p><p>She’d made it halfway down the block when a voice called out behind her.<br/>“Doctor Harkness!”</p><p>Agatha turned, and there was Rio — crossing the sidewalk, her jacket unzipped, holding out something dark.</p><p>“Your coat,” she said. “You left it on the chair.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, the words not immediately connecting. “Ah.” She took it, her fingers brushing Rio’s for just a second — a second too long. “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a beat, brow furrowed slightly. “Are you alright?”</p><p>The question was gentle, but it hit too close.</p><p>Agatha straightened her shoulders. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move. “You left kind of suddenly.”</p><p>“I dislike crowds,” Agatha said quickly.</p><p>Rio’s head tilted, and those big brown eyes — wide, soft, infuriatingly earnest — locked on hers. “I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable.”</p><p>“You didn’t,” Agatha said, a little too fast.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said softly, nodding once. “Good.”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to breathe, to focus anywhere but on the warmth in those eyes. There was something disarmingly open about them — a sincerity she didn’t know how to stand in front of.</p><p>“Go back inside, Vidal,” she managed, voice low but steady. “Enjoy your evening.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curved, just slightly. “You too, Doctor.”</p><p>She turned, walking back toward the glow of the bar. Agatha watched her go, the easy rhythm of her stride, the way she tucked her hands into her pockets like she wasn’t in a hurry.</p><p>When Rio disappeared around the corner, Agatha exhaled slowly, pressing a hand to her coat where Rio’s fingers had brushed it.</p><p>“Pull yourself together,” she muttered under her breath. “You’re just overwhelmed with the social situation.”</p><p>But as she walked home through the quiet streets, coat still warm from Rio’s hands, Agatha couldn’t quite convince herself she believed it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The hospital’s morning hum had already begun by the time Agatha walked through the sliding doors the next week— the low thrum of voices, distant monitors, the faint hiss of a coffee machine that never seemed to rest.</p><p>She was early, as always.<br/> Control began with punctuality.</p><p>Her heels clicked briskly against the linoleum as she made her way toward the nurses’ station, flipping through a fresh stack of patient files. She’d barely reached the counter when she realised she wasn’t alone.</p><p>Alice Wu-Gulliver stood leaning against the desk, her paramedic uniform half unzipped, grinning as Jen  scribbled something onto a clipboard beside her. The energy between them was unmistakable — soft laughter, a little too close, the casual magnetism of people who didn’t need to speak to be understood.</p><p>“Didn’t know the nurses’ station doubled as a dating lounge,” Agatha said dryly, setting her files down.</p><p>Jen turned, one perfectly sculpted brow arching. “Good morning to you too, sunshine.”</p><p>Alice flushed immediately, fumbling for professionalism. “We were just, uh— talking about shift rotations.”</p><p>Jen smirked. “Sure, babe. Let’s go with that.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, scanning the morning logs. “If you’re going to flirt, at least do it out of the line of sight. Some of us are trying to maintain an illusion of efficiency.”</p><p>Jen rested her chin in her hand, watching her with wicked amusement. “You ever think maybe that’s your problem, Doctor? Too much efficiency, not enough fun.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. “I’m quite content with my lack of chaos, thank you.”</p><p>“Mm,” Jen said, unbothered. “When’s the last time you got laid?”</p><p>Alice nearly choked on her coffee. “Jen!”</p><p>“What?” Jen said, utterly unapologetic. “It’s a valid health question. Stress relief. Circulation. Blood pressure.”</p><p>Agatha froze mid-signature, pen hovering just above the paper. Slowly, she looked up, her expression cold enough to sterilise an operating room.</p><p>“When was the last time you used a filter?” she asked.</p><p>“Probably around the same time you used a sense of humour,” Jen said, smirking.</p><p>Before Agatha could deliver the verbal evisceration that line deserved, a familiar voice interrupted from behind her.</p><p>“Used a sense of humour for what?”</p><p>Agatha turned, relief flickering behind her practiced indifference, to find Teen standing in the doorway, clutching his clipboard like it contained state secrets. His stethoscope was half tangled, one curl sticking up stubbornly at the top of his head.</p><p>“Perfect timing,” Agatha said crisply. “Rounds. Now.”</p><p>Teen blinked. “Uh—okay. What were you—?”</p><p>“Sex,” Jen said cheerfully, making Alice choke on her coffee.</p><p>Teen’s face went crimson. “I— sorry— what—?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss a beat. “Don’t engage,” she said, already walking away. “It only encourages them.”</p><p>Teen scrambled after her, nearly tripping over his own feet. “Yes, Doctor!”</p><p>When they reached the hallway, he was still flustered, adjusting his clipboard. “Were they— um— serious?”</p><p>“Teen,” Agatha said, voice dry as bone, “if you wish to survive this residency, you will learn to never, under any circumstance, ask follow-up questions.”</p><p>“Right. Of course. Noted.” He hesitated, then added quietly, “I didn’t really want the answer anyway.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched — not quite a smile, but close enough to surprise her. “Good instincts. Let’s see if you can apply them to medicine.”</p><p>“Yes, Doctor,” he said, scribbling something down just to look useful.</p><p>They turned a corner, the rhythmic hum of the hospital settling around them. Agatha’s pulse had returned to normal; the warmth still prickling at her cheeks, less so. Professional order restored.</p><p>Finally, she handed Teen a chart. “Langford in three. Post-op in five. Keep up.”</p><p>“Yes, Doctor.”</p><p>He scurried off, and Agatha watched him go for a moment — all long limbs and nervous energy, still too soft for the work that hardened most people within months. She envied him a little, that eagerness untouched by loss.</p><p>The ward was calm for once. Not quiet — it was never quiet — but steady enough that her mind, usually kept disciplined by chaos, began to wander.</p><p>Jen’s earlier jab floated back like an echo.</p><p><em>When’s the last time you got laid</em>?</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. Honestly. The woman had the tact of a brick through glass.</p><p>Still… the question lingered.</p><p>It hadn’t even been that long— Had it?</p><p>She frowned, flipping through a patient file, scanning lines without actually reading them. Dates blurred together. Months folded into each other, the way they did when your life was ruled by shift rotations and night rounds.</p><p>The last time—<br/>Her stomach dropped.</p><p><em>Over a year</em>.</p><p>She blinked, startled by her own realisation. <em>A</em> <em>year</em>.</p><p>She’d been too busy, of course. The residency had devoured her first. Then came the endless string of overnight shifts, the stress, the constant forward motion she mistook for progress.</p><p>And then Nicky.</p><p>Her fingers stilled on the edge of the chart.</p><p>Nicky, with his too-big eyes and the soft way he’d asked if she could stay until the pain faded.<br/> Nicky, who had laughed at her terrible jokes.<br/> Nicky, whose small hand had gone cold in hers before she was ready to let go.</p><p>After that, everything in her life had collapsed into function. Eat. Work. Sleep. Repeat. There hadn’t been room for anything else — not laughter, not warmth, not touch.</p><p>Certainly not vulnerability.</p><p>She told herself it was discipline. That abstaining from distraction made her sharper, stronger.<br/> But if she was honest — brutally, privately honest — it was fear.</p><p>She didn’t trust herself to want anything she couldn’t save.</p><p>“Doctor?”</p><p>Teen’s voice jolted her from her thoughts. He was standing by the next curtain, clutching a chart to his chest. “Patient’s ready.”</p><p>“Right,” she said quickly, smoothing her coat. “Let’s proceed.”</p><p>He nodded, stepping aside for her to enter.</p><p>Agatha’s movements were automatic again — hands steady, voice even, heart quiet. But the moment of stillness lingered at the edges of her mind like a bruise.</p><p>Over a year.</p><p>It shouldn’t have mattered.<br/> She wasn’t that kind of woman — not sentimental, not lonely, certainly not pining.</p><p>And yet…<br/>When she closed her eyes for even a heartbeat too long, she saw a pair of brown eyes looking up at her from across a bar table, steady and warm.</p><p>It was infuriating.</p><p>“Teen,” she said briskly, needing to anchor herself in something solid, “remind me to update the discharge protocol on postoperative monitoring.”</p><p>“Yes, Doctor,” he said quickly, scribbling it down.</p><p>Agatha nodded once, forcing her focus back where it belonged — on order, precision, control.</p><p>But even as she did, she could feel it: the faint, unwelcome hum under her skin.<br/> The sense that something had started to stir.</p><p>Something she’d spent far too long convincing herself she didn’t need.</p><p> </p><p><br/>The call came just after sunset.</p><p>Agatha had been halfway through reviewing post-op notes when the sharp crackle of the hospital radio filled the corridor — a voice cutting through the static with words that made every head lift.</p><p>“—multiple casualties from a downtown fire. Heavy smoke, partial building collapse. Units en route to Westview General.”</p><p>An older nurse at the station paled. “That’s the old apartment block on Maple,” she murmured. “Four floors. No sprinkler system.”</p><p>Agatha set down her pen, pulse already quickening. “How far out?”</p><p>“Five minutes.”</p><p>The next few were instinct. Movement. Command.<br/> She stripped off her white coat and snapped on gloves, barking orders before she realised she was doing it. “Prep trauma bays two through five. Ventilators ready. Notify Dr. Romanoff and Kale — tell them to clear their surgical schedules.”</p><p>Nurses and techs scattered. Monitors flickered to life. The air in the ER shifted — that familiar tension, sharp and electric, humming just beneath the surface.</p><p>And then—<br/>The radio crackled again.</p><p>“Firefighter down. Repeat — firefighter down. Extraction in progress. Vitals unstable.”</p><p>The words hit Agatha like a blow.<br/> She froze mid-step, eyes locked on the radio.</p><p>A firefighter.</p><p>Her chest tightened before her mind caught up. It was irrational, she knew that. There were dozens of them in Westview. She didn’t know why her pulse spiked like that — why her stomach dropped as though her body already <em>knew</em>.</p><p>She forced herself to move. “Double the trauma prep,” she ordered. “Now.”</p><p>The ambulance bay doors burst open a few minutes later, red lights spilling across the floor. Paramedics shouted vitals as they wheeled in stretchers — smoke-streaked faces, burns, lacerations. The smell of ash hit like a wall.</p><p>And then she saw the uniform.<br/> Blackened.

<p>“Incoming!” one of the paramedics called. “Firefighter, late twenties, conscious, multiple fractures—”<br/>Agatha stepped forward— And froze.</p><p> </p><p><br/>It wasn’t Rio.</p><p>It was Tony Stark.</p><p>His face was smeared with soot, one eye already swelling shut, but the grin was unmistakable even through the pain. “Don’t look so disappointed to see me, Doc.”</p><p>For one split second, her body didn’t catch up to her brain.</p><p>The flood of relief came fast and sharp — like air after being held underwater too long. Her chest loosened, her knees steadied, and the ringing in her ears dulled to silence.</p><p>She exhaled, sharply, the tension in her shoulders releasing all at once. “Mr. Stark,” she said, voice steady again. “I see you’ve found a new way to inconvenience me.”</p><p>“Wouldn’t want you getting bored,” he managed through a wince.</p><p>“Try harder next time,” she said, checking the monitors as the team wheeled him in. “Let’s get X-rays and a trauma panel— his leg’s at least fractured, possibly worse.”</p><p>“Copy that,” one of the nurses said.</p><p>As they moved around her, Agatha’s gaze swept the ambulance bay — scanning the crowd of first responders, the chaos of soot-streaked faces, the blur of uniforms moving in and out of triage. She searched for one in particular.</p><p>No dark curls. No calm brown eyes. No Rio.</p><p>Her stomach tightened again, the earlier relief splintering into unease.</p><p>Then Captain Steve Rogers appeared at Tony’s side, streaked with soot but uninjured, his expression grim. </p><p>“She got him out just in time.”</p><p>Agatha looked up. “Who?”</p><p>“Vidal,” Steve said. “Building came down while they were inside. He went down first, she pulled him out before the roof gave way.”</p><p>Something inside Agatha twisted hard, her pulse jumping before she could stop it. </p><p>“Is she—?”</p><p>“She’s fine,” Steve said quickly, reading the question in her face. “Bruised, a little shaken. She refused treatment, stayed behind to help the other units.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, forcing herself to keep her tone neutral. The relief that surged through her was too big, too dangerous — and entirely hers to contain. She swallowed it down, smoothing her expression into professional calm. </p><p>“Of course she did.”</p><p>Steve gave a small smile. “Wouldn’t be Tony’s first choice of hero, but she earned the title tonight.”</p><p>Tony groaned from the gurney. “Hey, I heard that.”</p><p>“Good,” Steve said dryly.</p><p>Agatha allowed herself a single breath — controlled, quiet — before snapping back to focus. “Let’s move,” she ordered, her voice clear and calm again. “X-ray in fifteen, ortho consult on standby.”</p><p>As Tony was wheeled toward imaging, she lingered for just a second longer, the adrenaline ebbing from her system.</p><p>She told herself she was only shaken because it had been a busy night. Because it could have been anyone.</p><p>But when the smell of smoke still clung faintly to the air, and she thought of Rio’s soft smile and caring eyes, Agatha had to grip the counter to steady herself.</p><p>The thought of something happening to her.</p><p>She wasn’t supposed to care this much.<br/> Not again.</p><p> </p><p>By the time the last of the fire victims had been stabilised, it was past midnight.<br/> The ER smelled of antiseptic, adrenaline, and smoke — that sharp, acrid kind that clings to skin no matter how hard you scrub.</p><p>Agatha moved through it all with her usual precision, issuing orders, double-checking vitals, scribbling notes. On the surface, she was calm, efficient, detached. But beneath that, something restless churned.</p><p>Steve’s words replayed in her mind.<br/><em> Vidal pulled him out before the roof gave way</em>.</p><p>Every time she passed the ambulance bay doors, her gaze flicked instinctively toward them.</p><p>Empty.<br/> No new stretchers.<br/> No Rio.</p><p>Each time she told herself it was irrelevant. She had patients. Protocol. Work.</p><p>But the part of her that wasn’t a doctor — the small, inconveniently human part — didn’t believe it.</p><p>With every siren that echoed from the distance, her chest tightened, and her eyes flicked up, searching the doorway before she could stop herself. The ER was a blur of motion and noise, but she couldn’t focus. </p><p>Not fully. Not until she knew.</p><p>She forced her attention back to Tony Stark’s X-ray summary, her handwriting tightening across the page. Numbers and notes, familiar, grounding — but they refused to quiet the restless pulse behind her ribs.</p><p>Then a voice broke through the hum.</p><p>“Firefighter Vidal’s here to see Tony,” Kate called from the nurses’ station, slightly breathless. “Just walked in. Said she was fine, but she’s limping.”</p><p>The pen slipped from Agatha’s fingers, clattering onto the chart.</p><p>She didn’t remember standing. Or moving. Only the sound of her own footsteps echoing against the tile as she made her way down the corridor, her coat trailing behind her like a shadow.</p><p>The fluorescent lights seemed too bright, the air too thin. Her pulse thudded in her ears, steady and relentless.</p><p>And then — she saw her.</p><p>Rio stood near triage, half-turned toward a nurse, jacket slung over one arm. Her navy uniform was streaked with ash and grime. Soot marked the curve of her jaw, a stark line against her skin. Her hair, usually tied back, had come loose around her face, soft curls catching the light.</p><p>She looked calm — impossibly calm — as if she hadn’t just walked out of a collapsing building. Her voice was low and even, steady as ever, carrying that quiet authority that never needed to raise itself to be heard.</p><p>Agatha stopped a few paces away, the chaos of the ER fading into a distant hum. Relief surged so hard it almost hurt.</p><p>Her pulse was erratic, her palms cold. She drew in a slow breath, forcing herself to sound composed.</p><p>“You’re supposed to report to trauma if you’re injured.”</p><p>Rio turned at the sound of her voice, surprise flickering across her face before she smiled — small, tired, but unmistakably warm.</p><p>“Doctor Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest loosened in the smallest, most dangerous way. She took a step closer before she could stop herself. The sharp, chemical scent of disinfectant mingled with smoke and sweat. Rio smelled like the aftermath of fire — burnt wood and adrenaline — a scent that shouldn’t have felt reassuring, but somehow did.</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha said quietly. “Don’t tell me you’re fine.”</p><p>Rio blinked, caught off guard by the tone. “I was checked at the scene. Just bruises.”</p><p>“Bruises,” Agatha repeated, voice low. “You were inside a collapsing building.”</p><p>Rio’s smile wavered, but her tone stayed steady. “I’m alright. Really. Tony—”</p><p>“Tony is in radiology with a fractured femur,” Agatha cut in, sharper than intended. “He’s fine. Thanks to you, apparently.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened, the corners of her mouth curving faintly. “He’ll live. He’s too stubborn not to.”</p><p>“That’s not the point.” Agatha reached out before she could think better of it, fingers brushing Rio’s forearm. Her skin was warm beneath the soot, the faint tremor of muscle betraying the exhaustion she tried to hide.</p><p>“You should be in a bay,” Agatha said softly. “Not standing here pretending you’re invincible.”</p><p>Rio’s voice lowered, quiet but sure. “It’s part of the job.”</p><p>“And so is following medical instruction,” Agatha replied, but the bite in her voice faltered halfway through. Her throat was too tight, her heart still not entirely settled from the sight of her standing there.</p><p>Rio caught it. Of course she did. She always noticed more than she should.</p><p>Her eyes softened, that deep brown steady and knowing. “Are you worried about me, Doctor?”</p><p>Agatha straightened instinctively, searching for her usual distance. “I worry about all my patients.”</p><p>Rio smiled just enough for the gap between her teeth to show. “Good thing I’m not your patient then.”</p><p>That earned a glare — faint, half-hearted. “You will be if you don’t let someone look at that leg.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then sighed, conceding. “Alright.”</p><p>She followed Agatha toward an empty exam bay. The fluorescent lights above hummed quietly, painting the room in sterile white as Rio sat on the edge of the gurney and pulled off her boot with a wince.</p><p>Agatha crouched, her movements precise but gentle, her fingers brushing against soot and fabric as she examined the swelling around Rio’s ankle. The bruise had already begun to bloom — purple and angry against the tan of her skin.</p><p>“You pushed it too far,” she murmured.</p><p>Rio’s voice came soft, almost apologetic. “Wouldn’t have left Tony behind.”</p><p>Agatha looked up then, catching the faint shimmer of sweat along her hairline, the exhaustion clinging to her edges. “You could have died.”</p><p>Rio met her gaze, calm and unwavering. “So could he.”</p><p>The words settled between them like smoke — heavy, inevitable, lingering.</p><p>For a long moment, neither moved. The world outside the curtain seemed far away: the noise, the lights, the endless chaos. It was just the two of them, breathing in sync.</p><p>Agatha forced herself to move first. She stripped off her gloves, exhaling through her nose. “You’re impossibly stubborn.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curved. “So I’ve been told.”</p><p>Agatha almost smiled. “You’ll need to ice that ankle and stay off it for at least forty-eight hours.”</p><p>“I’ll try.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, standing. “You’ll do.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes glinted faintly, amusement flickering through the fatigue. “Yes, Doctor.”</p><p>When Agatha turned to dispose of the gloves, she realised her hands were trembling slightly. She clenched them until they stilled.</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said quietly.</p><p>Agatha looked back. “For what?”</p><p>“For caring.”</p><p>The words landed like a stone in her chest. Too direct. Too kind.</p><p>Agatha looked away, voice cool again. “Go home, Firefighter Vidal.”</p><p>Rio hesitated in the doorway, her hand resting lightly on the frame. The overhead light caught in her hair, turning the soot into something almost silver.</p><p>For a moment, neither spoke.</p><p>Then Rio’s voice, soft but certain: “Goodnight, Agatha.”</p><p>It was the first time Rio had said her name.</p><p>The sound of it, low and steady, landed somewhere deep beneath the layers Agatha had spent years building. Her pulse spiked, sharp and sudden, betraying her before she could think.</p><p>She blinked, her composure faltering just enough that her lips curved into the smallest, most reluctant of smiles. “Goodnight,” she said, softer than she intended.</p><p>Rio turned and walked out, her silhouette framed briefly in the light before the door swung shut behind her.</p><p>Agatha stood for a moment in the now-silent bay, her pulse still unsteady and the faintest smile ghosting across her lips.</p><p>Then she exhaled, set the chart aside, and pressed her palms against the counter, steadying herself as if the world had tilted slightly off its axis.</p><p>One word. Her name.</p><p>And somehow, it had undone her completely.</p>

<p>The morning after the fire was heavy and grey, as if even the sky hadn’t slept.</p><p>Westview General moved slower than usual with fewer jokes at the nurses’ station, more yawns hidden behind cups of cheap coffee. Everyone had stayed late the night before, and exhaustion clung to the air like static.</p><p>Agatha arrived early anyway. She always did. Habit was a form of control, and control was what kept her steady.</p><p>She set her bag on the counter, exchanging quiet nods with Wanda and Jen. Neither woman had their usual spark. Wanda’s hair was pulled back messily,, her scrubs creased, and Jen’s eyeliner was smudged, though she still somehow looked elegant.</p><p>“Morning,” Wanda said, her voice soft.</p><p>“Morning,” Agatha replied, reaching for a stack of charts.</p><p>Jen yawned. “I could sleep for a week.”</p><p>“You can’t,” Agatha said dryly. “Rounds in fifteen.”</p><p>That earned a faint laugh. Wanda shook her head, smiling just enough to break the tension. “Of course you’re still on schedule.”</p><p>“It’s how we function,” Agatha said.</p><p>Wanda didn’t argue. She just handed her a coffee — black, strong, exactly how she liked it. “Drink it before you start snapping at people.”</p><p>Agatha accepted it with a small nod. “Noted.”</p><p>Teen appeared moments later, slightly disheveled but determined. “Morning, Doctor! Ready when you are.”</p><p>“You’re late,” she said automatically.</p><p>“Only by two minutes!”</p><p>“Which is still late.” She handed him a chart. “Mr. Stark in Recovery Bay Three. You’re observing.”</p><p>Teen straightened. “Got it.”</p><p>When they reached the bay, Agatha braced herself for Stark’s usual dramatics. What she didn’t expect was the company.</p><p>Tony wasn’t alone.</p><p>Two firefighters stood beside his bed-Bucky Barnes, tall and steady as ever, and Rio Vidal.</p><p>Rio was out of uniform today, wearing a dark shirt and jeans. Her hair was tied loosely back, the faintest trace of bruising still visible along her jaw. She looked tired but grounded, and when she glanced up, Agatha felt the familiar jolt she was beginning to hate.</p><p>Tony was mid-story, gesturing animatedly to a young blonde nurse-- Yelena Belova, one of the newest hires, bright-eyed and far too awake for the hour. Her accent curled softly around her words, each syllable touched with that lilting Russian edge that made everything she said sound almost mischievous.</p><p>“So there I am,” Tony said, “smoke all around, building coming down, and I’m trying to carry this guy out with one good leg—”</p><p>Bucky groaned. “Tony.”</p><p>“What? It’s a good story!”</p><p>“It’s bullshit,” Bucky said, crossing his arms. “You didn’t carry anyone. You were half-conscious, pinned under a beam, and Rio pulled you out.”</p><p>Yelena’s eyes widened, her voice rising in an admiring lilt. “She did?”</p><p>Rio shifted, uncomfortable under the attention. “It wasn’t just me. We worked as a team.”</p><p>Bucky shook his head. “You went back in when the roof was collapsing. That’s not nothing.”</p><p>Tony waved a hand. “Details, shmetails. What matters is I maintained morale.”</p><p>“By screaming like a little bitch?” Bucky said.</p><p>“I was not!” Tony shot back.</p><p>Yelena giggled, brushing a loose strand of hair behind her ear as she looked up at Rio. “That’s incredible, though. You really went back in?”</p><p>Rio rubbed the back of her neck, clearly uncomfortable but too polite to brush her off. “It’s my job.”</p><p>Yelena smiled, her tone soft, admiring. “Still, you’re kind of amazing.”</p><p>Agatha felt her jaw tighten before she could stop it. The sound of Yelena’s laugh grated against her nerves, that light, airy giggle entirely too close to Rio’s quiet humility. And Rio—kind, oblivious Rio—was blushing.</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest burned hot and unreasonable.</p><p>Before she could think better of it, she spoke. “Nurse Belova, you’re behind on your post-op checks.”</p><p>Yelena jumped, straightening so fast she nearly dropped her tablet. “Oh! Right, sorry, Doctor!” Her accent thickened slightly with surprise. She gave Rio a quick, almost apologetic smile before hurrying out, the curtain rustling closed behind her.</p><p>The moment she was gone, Tony grinned from his pillow. “You have that effect on people, Doc. The whole room chills.”</p><p>Agatha ignored him, flipping open his chart. “Your X-rays show a clean femoral fracture. Six weeks non-weight-bearing, then reassessment. I suggest you avoid collapsing structures in the meantime.”</p><p>“Where’s the fun in that?” Tony muttered.</p><p>“Fun,” Agatha said evenly, “is not a treatment plan.”</p><p>Teen scribbled something on his clipboard to hide his grin.</p><p>Bucky smirked. “Don’t mind him, Doctor. He’s been milking this all morning.”</p><p>Agatha turned her attention toward Rio, who stood quietly at the end of the bed. Her weight was balanced more evenly this time, exhaustion etched on her features.</p><p>“How’s the ankle?” Agatha asked, her tone brisk but not unkind.</p><p>Rio seemed surprised by the question, then smiled a little. “Better. I did what you said — iced it, kept it up for most of the night.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, scanning her posture. “And today?”</p><p>“Still stiff, but manageable.”</p><p>“Manageable,” Agatha repeated, crossing her arms. “You remember what I said about rest?”</p><p>Rio nodded, the corner of her mouth twitching. “Something about making your job easier.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved, just slightly. “I see youre capable of following directions after all.”</p><p>Rio’s smile grew, soft and genuine. “I try, Doctor.”</p><p>Agatha made the mistake of holding her gaze a moment too long. That same warmth, quiet, steady, utterly disarming, flickered there again, and she felt the jealousy drain into something far more dangerous: affection.</p><p>She turned back to Tony’s chart before anyone could notice the flush creeping up her neck.</p><p>Tony groaned dramatically. “You two done bonding? Some of us are in agony here.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even glance his way. “If you can complain that loudly, you’re fine.”</p><p>Bucky chuckled. “I keep telling him that.”</p><p>Agatha made one last note on the chart. “Keep the leg elevated, Mr. Stark. And do try to refrain from heroics for the foreseeable future.”</p><p>“Heroics?” Tony said, grinning. “You mean ‘dramatic rescues.’”</p><p>“Call it what you like,” she replied dryly, then looked briefly back at Rio. “Try to stay out of trouble,  Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes lifted to meet hers. “I’ll do my best.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, sharply, and turned to leave. Teen followed close behind, still glancing over his shoulder like he was watching a movie play out.</p><p>In the hallway, he finally said, “You really do care about her.”</p><p>Agatha shot him a look that could freeze fire. “I care about all my patients.”</p><p>Teen raised an eyebrow but wisely said nothing else.</p><p>Still, as they walked toward the next bay, Agatha’s thoughts refused to fall back into order.</p><p>She told herself it was routine follow-up — professionalism, nothing more.<br/> But when she caught herself replaying Rio’s quiet smile, she knew she was lying.</p><p>The day crawled after that.</p><p>Even with the steady rhythm of charting, check-ins, and post-op rounds, Agatha’s focus kept slipping, not enough to make mistakes, but enough to irritate her. Normally, she thrived on control. Precision. The satisfying predictability of cause and effect.</p><p>But today, everything felt slightly off-kilter.</p><p>By late afternoon, she found herself in the staff lounge, sitting at one of the small round tables with her third cup of coffee going cold in her hands. She hadn’t meant to stop moving. She just… had.</p><p>The door creaked open, and Wanda stepped in. Her scrubs were rumpled, hair escaping its tie, but she still carried that easy calm that had a way of disarming people without trying.</p><p>“You’ve been still for ten minutes,” Wanda said, dropping into the chair across from her. “Should I be worried?”</p><p>“I’m taking a break,” Agatha said, her tone clipped.</p><p>“Voluntarily?” Wanda smiled faintly. “That’s new.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Doctors are human.”</p><p>“Some of them,” Wanda said, tilting her head. “But not you, apparently. You look like you haven’t stopped since last night.”</p><p>“I haven’t,” Agatha admitted. “Too much to do.”</p><p>“Or too much to avoid,” Wanda murmured.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked up. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Wanda shrugged lightly. “You’ve been distracted all day. It’s not like you.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said automatically.</p><p>“That’s what you said last night when I told you to go home,” Wanda replied, soft but firm. “You’ve been fine so many times I’m starting to think you have no other settings.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, caught somewhere between annoyance and something that might have been gratitude. “You should consider minding your own business.”</p><p>“I should,” Wanda said easily. “But then who would make sure you don’t fall apart quietly in a supply closet?”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched, despite herself. “You’re remarkably nosey.”</p><p>“Someone has to be,” Wanda said. “It’s part of the small town lore.”</p><p>For a moment, they sat in companionable silence. The distant hum of monitors and overhead announcements filled the space between them.</p><p>Finally, Wanda asked, “How’s your firefighter?”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse stuttered. “She’s not <em>my</em> firefighter.”</p><p>“Mm,” Wanda said, sipping her tea. “And yet you knew who I meant.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly. “She’s fine. Ankle’s improved. She followed instructions.”</p><p>“That must be rare,” Wanda teased gently.</p><p>“It is,” Agatha said, setting down her coffee. “And appreciated.”</p><p>Wanda studied her for a moment, then nodded as if she’d reached a quiet conclusion. “You know, you don’t have to hold everything together all the time. You’re allowed to care about people.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was calm, but the faintest tremor hid beneath it. “That’s not the problem.”</p><p>“What is?”</p><p>“Caring tends to end badly,” Agatha said simply.</p><p>Wanda’s gaze softened. “Not always.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands. “Often enough.”</p><p>Neither spoke for a long time after that.</p><p>Eventually, Wanda stood, stretching. “You should go home soon. Lilia will worry.”</p><p>“She always worries,” Agatha said.</p><p>“Maybe because she’s usually right to,” Wanda said, smiling.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twitched into the ghost of a smile. “Go back to work, Maximoff.”</p><p>Wanda picked up her tea, pausing at the door. “I am. You should try it… the <em>home</em> part, not the <em>work</em> part.”</p><p>And then she was gone, leaving Agatha alone again with her cooling coffee and the faint echo of words she didn’t want to think about.</p><p>She sat there for another minute, then finally stood, straightened her coat, and told herself she wasn’t avoiding anything.</p><p><br/>She should have gone straight home, Lilia was doing a reading for someone across town, but the idea of the quiet house felt too heavy, too expectant.<br/>So she found herself at the grocery store instead, a small local place with handwritten labels and humming lights. The aisles smelled faintly of citrus and herbs.</p><p>It had been weeks since she’d cooked anything. Lilia always insisted on feeding her — soups, caesseroles, stews that tasted like comfort and safety. But tonight, Agatha wanted to return the gesture. Something simple. Pasta, maybe. Wine. A way of saying <em>thank you</em> without having to say it.</p><p>She was debating btween two kinds of basil when a voice behind her said, softly, “Doctor Harkness?”<br/>Agatha turned, already halfway through a sigh, but stopped when she saw Alice Wu-Gulliver standing there, clutching a small basket to her chest. She wasn’t in uniform, just dark jeans and a green sweater, her hair tied up loosely. Her smile was shy but genuine.</p><p>“Paramedic Wu,” Agatha said, nodding. “You’re not on duty?”</p><p>Alice shook her head, a quiet laugh escaping her. “No. I’m making dinner for Jen tonight. We’ve got the apartment to ourselves for once. Rio’s on night duty at the station.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “A rare occurrence, then.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Alice said, smiling softly. “Between her shifts and ours, the place usually feels more like a drop-in centre than a home. But tonight it’s just us so I’m gonna try cook, I even picked up dessert. Jen loves tiramisu.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Ambitious.”</p><p>Alice grinned, a little bashful. “Maybe. I’m not much of a cook, but she deserves something nice.” She hesitated, shifting the basket in her arms. “Rio was teasing me earlier before she left for the station. Said I was trying too hard.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression stayed neutral, but the name hit her like a pulse beneath the skin, that strange little thrum she could never quite explain. “Is that so.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Alice said, still smiling. “But I think she’s glad I found someone… Then she started talking about you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Me?”</p><p>Alice nodded. “She mentioned how you handled everything after the fire. Said the hospital staff all look to you when things go wrong. That you’ve got this... calm about you. Like nothing shakes you.”</p><p>Agatha adjusted a box of linguine in her basket, pretending to study the label. “I don’t see why she’d bring that up.”</p><p>Alice shrugged, her tone gentle. “She notices people. You more than most, I think. She talks about you more than she probably realises.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened slightly. “Admiration tends to fade once people spend enough time with me.”</p><p>“Maybe not her,” Alice said softly. “Rio doesn’t connect… easily. But when she does, it’s usually for good reason.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her for a moment, the air between them feeling oddly fragile. Then she straightened. <br/>“Well. Enjoy your evening, Paramedic Wu. Try not to burn anything.”</p><p>Alice smiled, cheeks flushing. “No promises. Goodnight, Doctor.”</p><p>When Alice disappeared down another aisle, Agatha stood there for a long moment, staring blankly at the shelves of pasta.</p><p>She could almost hear Lilia’s voice in her mind, teasing and wise. <em>Stop hiding, my girl</em>. </p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, shook her head, and added a bottle of wine to her basket.</p><p>It didn’t mean anything.</p><p><br/>The house was dim when Agatha stepped inside, the last light of evning spilling through the curtains in soft amber stripes. She hung her coat by the door and set the grocery bags on the counter. The silence felt companionable rather than heavy for once.</p><p>She filled the pot with water, let it come to a simmer, and began chopping garlic with precise, practiced motions. Olive oil, basil, a squeeze of lemon, movements that belonged to muscle memory more than thought. The smell rose, sharp and comforting, curling through the kitchen like something alive.</p><p>It was strange, cooking again. She couldn’t remember the last time she’d done it properly. In Boston, it had been ramen and vending machines, energy drinks, the kind of exhaustion that made even boiling water seem extravagant. </p><p>By the time she was tossing the pasta, the front door opened, and Lilia’s familiar voice floated in.<br/>“Agatha?”</p><p>“In the kitchen,” she called.</p><p>There was a pause, then a soft gasp. “You’re cooking?”</p><p>Agatha turned just in time to see Lilia standing in the doorway, shawl slipping from her shoulders, eyes wide as if she’d just walked into a miracle.</p><p>“Don’t sound so horrified,” Agatha said dryly, stirring the sauce. “It’s edible, I promise.”</p><p>Lilia laughed, delighted. “I’ve been trying to teach you that dish for fifteen years, and now you’re suddenly a chef while I’m out of the house? You’ve wounded me, my girl.”</p><p>Agatha shrugged, faint amusement tugging at her lips. “You finally got through to me, apparently. It’s the only thing I ever managed to learn properly. Kept me fed back in Boston when I wasn’t running on fumes and ramen.”</p><p>Lilia leaned against the counter, arms folded, a smile softening her face. “Ah, yes. The diet of a poor med student.”</p><p>“It was efficient,” Agatha said, plating the pasta. “Questionable nutrition, but efficient.”</p><p>Lilia moved to the cupboard, pulling out plates and glasses as if the motion might keep her from getting sentimental. “You never cooked in Boston when I came to visit. You always looked like you were trying to outrun yourself.”</p><p>“I was,” Agatha said simply. Then she handed her a plate. “Sit. Eat.”</p><p>Lilia obeyed, perching at the small kitchen table, the steam from her dish rising in gentle curls. She took one bite, then another, and closed her eyes with an exaggerated hum of approval.</p><p>“It’s perfect,” she declared. “Balanced. Bright. Just the right amount of salt. You’ve finally mastered the language of food.”</p><p>Agatha sat across from her, resting her elbow on the table. “It’s linguine, not Latin.”</p><p>“Cooking is a kind of magic too,” Lilia said, smiling. “The simple kind that reminds you you’re alive.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes but didn’t argue. “You always say things like that.”</p><p>“Because they’re true.”</p><p>They ate quietly for a while, the clink of forks and the low hum of the fridge filling the space between them. Lilia watched Agatha — her almost-daughter — in that way she did when she was thinking too much, and finally said, “You’re calmer tonight. Lighter somehow. Should I credit the cooking or something else?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up from her plate. “Cooking,” she said after a moment. “Definitely cooking.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled, unconvinced but gracious enough not to press. “Then cook more often.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Careful. You might get used to this.”</p><p>“My dream,” Lilia said with a mock sigh, “to live long enough to see you eat before midnight and smile while doing it.”</p><p>Agatha smirked faintly. “Don’t get used to that either.”</p><p>Lilia dabbed her mouth with a napkin and said, almost casually, “I ran into an old friend in town today.”</p><p>Agatha glanced up. “Should I be impressed?”</p><p>“Maybe.” Lilia’s eyes twinkled. “Doctor Stephen Strange. You know him?”</p><p>Agatha stilled. “The surgeon who had the car accident?”</p><p>“The same. He’s a therapist now. Works with trauma cases mostly.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “Of course he does.”</p><p>Lilia studied her for a beat. “He’s very good at what he does. We had coffee. I told him you were here—”</p><p>“Lilia.” Agatha’s tone sharpened. “If this is leading where I think it’s leading, stop.”</p><p>Lilia tilted her head, unbothered by the warning. “You’ve been carrying a lot, my dear. Talking to someone might help lighten it.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet, bitter laugh. “I talk to you.”</p><p>Lilia smiled faintly. “Oh yes. Every day you pour your heart out over breakfast. I’m drowning in your vulnerability.”</p><p>“I’m serious,” Agatha said, and there was an edge there now—too sharp, too brittle. “I don’t need therapy. I refused it in Boston, and I’ll refuse it here.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice gentled. “Because it hurt too much to talk about him?”</p><p>Agatha froze. The air seemed to tighten. “<em>Don’t.</em>”</p><p>Lilia didn’t flinch. “You still blame yourself, even if you won’t say it out loud.”</p><p>“I did everything I could.”</p><p>“I know you did.”</p><p>Agatha pushed her plate away, appetite gone. “Then stop implying I didn’t.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Lilia said softly. “I’m saying you never forgave yourself for surviving when he didn’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. Her hands clenched in her lap. For a long moment, the only sound was the slow tick of the kitchen clock.</p><p>When she finally spoke, her voice was low but trembling. “I’m fine, Lilia. I just... I need to keep moving forward. That’s how I survive.”</p><p>“Moving forward is not the same as healing,” Lilia murmured.</p><p>“I don’t care what it’s called,” Agatha said, standing abruptly to gather the dishes. “As long as it works.”</p><p>Lilia rose too, touching her arm gently. “You can’t outrun grief forever, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha paused, staring down at the dishes in her hands. “Watch me.”</p><p>For a heartbeat, neither of them moved. Then Lilia sighed, sadness softening her features. “I just don’t want to watch you disappear under the weight of it.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat felt tight. She blinked hard, set the dishes in the sink, and busied herself with turning off the stove. “I survived it once. I’ll survive it again.”</p><p>“Surviving isn’t living,” Lilia whispered.</p><p>That time, Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>She stood there, back turned, one hand gripping the edge of the counter like it was the only thing keeping her upright. Her reflection in the window looked almost like a stranger — tired eyes, too pale, the faintest tremor in her jaw.</p><p>Finally, she said, quieter now, “You’re right about one thing. I did learn something in Boston. I learned that talking doesn’t always help. Sometimes it just makes the silence louder afterward.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes glistened, but her voice stayed calm. “Then maybe what you need isn’t silence. Maybe it’s someone who knows how to listen.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. “Goodnight, Lilia.”</p><p>She left the kitchen before Lilia could reply.</p><p>From the doorway, Lilia watched her disappear up the stairs. Then she turned back to the table, exhaled softly, and whispered to the quiet room, “You can keep running, my girl, but your heart will catch up eventually.”</p><p><br/>Mornings at Westview General were different.</p><p>In Boston, Agatha had lived for chaos — the rush of sirens, the blur of movement, the constant demand that made her feel alive. But here, in this smaller hospital tucked between quiet streets and sleepy cafés, the chaos came in softer waves. It was slower, steadier, and against all logic, she found she didn’t hate it.</p><p>It wasn’t what she was used to. But lately, Agatha was beginning to understand the value of a calm start.</p><p>She was midway through signing off a case when a familiar voice came from the doorway.</p><p>“Doctor Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha looked up. Chief Natasha Romanoff stood with a clipboard tucked neatly under one arm, posture sharp even this early. She had the composed, faintly amused expression of someone who’d already been awake for hours.</p><p>“Chief,” Agatha said, setting down her pen. “If this is about the rotation schedule, I—”</p><p>Natasha lifted a hand. “Relax. I’m not here to scold you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, wary. “That would be a first.”</p><p>Natasha smirked and crossed the room, resting against the edge of the desk. “Actually, I’m here to say something nice, which, as you know, pains me deeply.”</p><p>“Shall I prepare myself?” Agatha asked dryly.</p><p>Natasha ignored the jab, her tone softening just enough to be sincere. “You’ve made an incredible start here, Harkness. The staff talk about you — in good ways, I promise. You’ve already set a new standard in the ER.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back in her chair, studying her. “If this is an elaborate setup before you ask me to take on another intern, I’m not falling for it.”</p><p>A small laugh escaped Natasha. “No setup. Just recognition. Wanda says you’re a machine, and Jen called you terrifyingly competent. Even Teen seems devoted to you.”</p><p>“Teen is terrified of me,” Agatha corrected.</p><p>“Same thing,” Natasha said. “Whatever you’re doing, keep doing it.”</p><p>For a moment, the compliment hung there — rare and genuine, like sunlight breaking through early fog. </p><p>Agatha didn’t quite know what to do with it.</p><p>“I didn’t come here for approval,” she said, quieter than before. “Just to work.”</p><p>“I know,” Natasha said. “That’s why you fit here. Westview isn’t Boston — it’s smaller, closer. We notice when someone gives a damn.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her coffee, the steam curling faintly. “That’s not always a strength.”</p><p>Natasha’s smile softened, something knowing behind it. “It is when you let it be.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She never did when someone hit too closed to truth.</p><p>Natasha straightened, glancing toward the hall as the morning noise began to build. “Try not to live in this place. Even great doctors need to remember what morning light looks like outside of these walls.”</p><p>“Noted,” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>“Good.” Natasha started for the door, then paused. “You’re doing well, Doctor. Better than you think.”</p><p>When she was gone, Agatha sat for a long moment, staring at the space she’d left. Compliments had always made her uneasy. They felt like a test — one she might fail if she let her guard drop.</p><p>But for the first time in a while, she allowed herself the smallest breath of pride. Just one. Then she opened the next chart and went back to work.</p><p>Her eyes scrunched as she read the details of the patient on the chart, she didn’t recognise the name as she scanned and focused on the patient’s date of birth. 2018. </p><p>A child.</p><p>A paediatric case had been mistakenly filed between her charts.</p><p>Peadiatrics was the one ward Agatha avoided whenever she could.<br/> She didn’t need to be told why.<br/> The smell of disinfectant laced with sugar from the nurses’ pockets, the laughter, the bright murals — it all pressed against something raw inside her chest.</p><p>Nicky’s laughter had sounded like that.<br/> The memory came sharp, like a needle prick behind her ribs.</p><p>But now she had to deliver a file. A simple drop-off. Nothing more.</p><p>The elevator doors slid open onto the bright chaos of the peadiatric floor — the sound of laughter, the patter of small feet, and somewhere in the middle of it, the soft, happy bark of a dog.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>A therapy dog sat in the corridor surrounded by a ring of children in hospital gowns. The handler smiled as one of the nurses handed out treats, and crouched among them was a figure Agatha recognised instantly.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She was wearing her navy Fire &amp; Rescue T-shirt, navy cargo’s and her black work boots. Her dark hair was tied back loosely, and she was laughing, head tipped forward as the dog licked her hand.</p><p>Agatha’s heart gave an unsteady jolt.</p><p>Rio guided a small boy forward — maybe six or seven, pale and thin but grinning — coaxing him closer to the dog. “He likes brave kids,” Rio said gently. “And you look pretty brave to me.”</p><p>The boy reached out, tentative, and the dog leaned into his hand. The other children clapped, soft and delighted.</p><p>Agatha took a step back, breath hitching.<br/> Her vision blurred — not from tears, but from the way memory hit without warning.</p><p>Because for a heartbeat, the boy’s brown eyes weren’t his at all. They were Nicky’s.<br/> Wide, trusting.<br/> Begging her to do something she couldn’t.</p><p>Her throat closed. The sounds around her warped — laughter too loud, the bark echoing like static in her ears. The colours of the hallway seemed to smear, bright blues and yellows bleeding into one another until she couldn’t focus. Her pulse thundered in her ears, each beat heavier than the last.</p><p>She tried to breathe but the air wouldn’t reach her lungs. The walls felt too close, the light too sharp. Her fingers went numb where they clutched the chart.</p><p><em>Not here. Not now</em>.</p><p>Her body wouldn’t listen. Her knees trembled, her chest seizing around air that wouldn’t move. She reached for the counter, fingertips catching the edge, but the world was already dimming at the edges.</p><p>“Doctor Harkness?”</p><p>The voice came through muffled at first, like underwater — steady, low, familiar.</p><p>Then closer. “Agatha?”</p><p>A warm hand touched her shoulder, grounding and real. “Hey,” Rio said quietly, voice cutting through the static. “Come with me.”</p><p>The world tilted, but Agatha let herself be led through a side door, into one of the quiet consultation rooms. The door clicked softly behind them, sealing out the noise.</p><p>“Sit,” Rio said gently, guiding her toward the chair. Not a command, just calm certainty.</p><p>Agatha sank down hard, pressing her palms to her eyes. “I’m fine,” she tried, but her voice came out thin and ragged.</p><p>Rio crouched in front of her, voice steady but urgent. “You’re not breathing right.”</p><p>“I—” The word broke apart, her chest hitching. The room swayed faintly.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio murmured. “Then just follow me.”</p><p>Her tone was soft, deliberate like she’d done this before. She took Agatha’s trembling hand and pressed it gently to her own chest.</p><p>“Feel that?”</p><p>Agatha’s palm met warmth, the slow, steady thrum of Rio’s heart beneath her shirt.</p><p>“That’s what you match,” Rio said softly. “In…”<br/> She inhaled, deep and even.<br/> “…and out.”</p><p>At first, Agatha couldn’t. The air caught, stuttered, fractured in her throat. Her vision shimmered, edges still fading in and out, but then the sound of Rio’s breathing filled the silence, calm and rhythmic, and Agatha found herself following almost unconsciously.</p><p>One breath. Then another.<br/> The chaos receded by degrees.<br/> The world narrowed to Rio’s heartbeat under her palm, and her voice, low, patient, sure.</p><p>The tremor in Agatha’s hands eased. The static in her head softened.</p><p>“Good,” Rio whispered. “You’re okay. You’re right here.”</p><p>Her hand came up to the back of Agatha’s neck, warm and anchoring. The smell of her — cedar wood, pine, faint smoke — slipped through the antiseptic air, grounding her further.</p><p>Agatha’s muscles unclenched, her body remembering how to rest. She let her forehead fall forward until it rested lightly against Rio’s shoulder, still shaking but breathing again.</p><p>Neither of them spoke. The only sound was the soft, even rhythm of their breaths syncing, one steady, one fragile but returning to balance.</p><p>When Agatha finally drew back, her vision was clear again, though her chest still ached with the remnants of panic.</p><p>Rio stayed close, her voice low. “Better?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, barely. “Yes. Thank you.”</p><p>Rio smiled, gentle and real. “Good. You scared me for a second.”</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha whispered. “That wasn’t very professional.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “That was human.”</p><p>They stayed like that, neither moving, hands still linked. Agatha didn’t even notice until the air between them became warmer, closer.</p><p>She looked up, meeting Rio’s eyes, and the world seemed to slow again but this time, it wasn’t panic. <br/>It was gravity.</p><p>Her gaze flicked to Rio’s mouth just as Rio’s breath caught. For a second, neither of them moved.</p><p>Then they leaned in, slow, uncertain.</p><p>And just before their lips met—</p><p>The therapy dog barked from the hallway, loud and sudden, breaking the spell clean in two.</p><p>Rio startled and laughed, quiet and breathless. “Guess that’s my cue.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, a small, embarrassed smile tugging at her mouth. “Apparently.”</p><p>They both smiled then, small, fragile, but honest.</p><p>“I should get back,” Rio said softly, rising to her feet.</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha murmured, smoothing her coat though her hands still trembled faintly. “The children.”</p><p>Rio hesitated at the door, glancing back. “If you ever need to step out like that again… don’t do it alone.”</p><p>Agatha met her gaze. Her throat tightened, but her voice stayed even. “I’ll keep that in mind.”</p><p>Rio nodded once, then slipped out, the door closing quietly behind her.</p><p>For a moment, Agatha stayed where she was, the scent of cedar and smoke still clinging to the air.</p><p>Then she let out a long breath and whispered to the empty room, “Fuck.”</p><p><br/>By the time Agatha made it back to the ER, her pulse had almost returned to normal. Almost.</p><p>She told herself it was the adrenaline, the echo of the panic attack, the sharp aftertaste of memory.<br/> Not the fact that she had nearly kissed someone.<br/> Not the way that someone’s scent still clung faintly to her sleeve.</p><p>The fluorescent lights of the emergency ward felt too harsh after the soft quiet of the consultation room. <br/>The noise was grounding, though — the hum of monitors, the shuffle of gurneys, the clipped voices of nurses moving with purpose. This was where she belonged. Order. Focus. Control.</p><p>Wanda was leaning over the nurses’ station, scribbling a note on a chart when she looked up. “There you are,” she said. “I thought you’d gone home.”</p><p>“Just needed air,” Agatha replied smoothly.</p><p>Wanda studied her for a moment longer than was polite. “You look a little flushed. You okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said, too quickly.</p><p>“Mm.” Wanda’s eyes flicked down to Agatha’s hands, then back up. “You sure? You’ve got that post-adrenaline look. The one you get after surgery.”</p><p>Agatha reached for the nearest chart as if to anchor herself. “You’re imagining things.”</p><p>“Probably,” Wanda said lightly, though her gaze stayed on her. “Still, if you need five minutes, I can cover.”</p><p>“I don’t need five minutes,” Agatha said. “I need people to stop asking if I’m all right.”</p><p>Wanda smiled faintly. “Then you might consider looking less like someone who’s just remembered what feeling feels like.”</p><p>Agatha blinked at her, expression unreadable. “I have no idea what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Of course not.” Wanda’s voice was soft but knowing. “That’s what makes it so entertaining.”</p><p>Before Agatha could reply, a call came through on the intercom: “Doctor Harkness to Bay Two.”</p><p>Saved by the bell.</p><p>She grabbed her coat and moved quickly toward the doors.</p><p>The call in Bay Two turned out to be minor — a sprained wrist, nothing urgent. Agatha reset the joint, wrapped it, wrote her notes, all with mechanical precision. It should have been grounding. Familiar. Safe.<br/>It wasn’t.</p><p>Her heartbeat hadn’t quite found its rhythm again, and the ghost of that near-kiss still hovered somewhere behind her ribs, a pulse that didn’t belong entirely to her.</p><p>When she stepped out into the corridor, she caught sight of movement near the nurses’ station.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She was standing with the therapy dog from Paediatrics, one hand absently resting on the golden retriever’s head as she spoke to Nurse Belova. The young nurse was practically glowing, leaning on the counter, laughing at something Rio said.</p><p>Agatha slowed her pace without meaning to.</p><p>Rio looked different out here — calmer, cleaner. Her hair was a little messier now, her cheeks flushed from warmth or laughter or both.</p><p>Yelena tilted her head, smiling brightly. “You know, you don’t have to wait for official therapy visits. The kids would love to see you any time. I’d… probably love it too.”</p><p>Rio blinked, clearly missing the implication. “Oh, yeah. I usually come when the department organises it.”</p><p>Yelena leaned forward a little. “Still, maybe next time you could—”</p><p>“Firefighter Vidal,” Agatha said before she could stop herself.</p><p>Her voice cut cleanly across the ward, and both women looked up.</p><p>Rio’s expression softened instantly. “Doctor Harkness.”</p><p>Yelena straightened, the smile on her face turning sheepish. “Oh—Doctor Harkness! I was just, uh, thanking her for helping the kids earlier.”</p><p>“I see,” Agatha said, her tone even but her eyes sharp. “It’s good to know we’re fostering such… enthusiastic interdepartmental relations.”</p><p>Yelena blinked, uncertain whether she was being complimented or scolded. “Yes, Doctor. Of course, Doctor.” She glanced once at Rio, gave a little wave, and scurried off toward the supply room.</p><p>Agatha was left standing there, suddenly too aware of the silence that followed. The corridor hummed faintly with the sounds of the hospital — a monitor beeping in the distance, the soft bark of the therapy dog as he shook his fur — but between her and Rio, everything felt unusually still.</p><p>Rio shifted her weight, hand resting loosely on the leash. “Sorry if we were in the way. He likes meeting people.”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms, tilting her head slightly. “That much was clear. I’m not sure Nurse Belova’s heart will recover.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her brow creasing. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “She was flirting with you.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence as Rio processed that, her expression softening into faint confusion. “She was?”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, half-exasperated, half something else entirely. “Good lord, you really didn’t notice?”</p><p>Rio shook her head, frowning thoughtfully. “I thought she was just… being friendly.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, ready with some dry remark but it never came. Because suddenly she was struck by the sheer sincerity of it, the way Rio said it with absolute honesty, no trace of arrogance or false modesty. Just genuine bewilderment.</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest squeezed tight.</p><p>She turned slightly, pretending to study the therapy dog to hide the warmth creeping up her neck. “You might want to work on that particular blind spot, Vidal. It could lead to… misunderstandings.”</p><p>Rio gave a small, uncertain smile. “You mean I should pay more attention to people?”</p><p>“That would be a start,” Agatha said, her tone dry though the faint edge of fondness betrayed her.<br/>Rio crouched down to clip the leash back onto the dog’s vest, her movements calm and practiced. When she stood again, she hesitated a moment before speaking. “Actually… I came down to see what time you finish your shift.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard. “Why?”</p><p>Rio smiled softly, almost shyly. “There’s a little ice cream place down by the park. They stay open late. Thought maybe you could use something sweet after the day you’ve had.”</p><p>Agatha blinked again, incredulous. “Ice cream?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said, tone light. “You know, cold, sugary, comes in cones—”</p><p>“I’m familiar with the concept,” Agatha interrupted. “It just seems… juvenile.”</p><p>Rio’s smile faltered, the faintest flicker of embarrassment crossing her face. “Oh. I just thought—”</p><p>And that was what did it. That quiet, unassuming look — like she was already half-apologising for being kind.</p><p>Agatha felt herself soften before she could stop it.</p><p>“I finish at seven,” she said, voice gentler now. “And I prefer mint chocolate chip.”</p><p>Rio’s head lifted, eyes brightening, her grin blooming slow and warm. “Noted, Doctor.”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat, straightening her posture. “Don’t make me regret it, Firefighter Vidal.”</p><p>“I’ll do my best,” Rio said, the therapy dog’s leash in one hand, her smile still lingering as she walked away.</p><p>Agatha stood there for a long moment after she left, pulse unsteady and traitorous.</p><p>She told herself it was nothing — just ice cream. Just politeness.</p><p>But the truth was simpler.</p><p> </p><p> She wanted to see her again.</p>

<p> </p><p>The air outside the hospital was warm and heavy with the faint sweetness of early summer. Agatha stepped through the glass doors precisely at seven, coat folded neatly over her arm, her hair tied back but falling loose around her face. </p><p>She wasn’t sure why her heart had been keeping time with the clock for the last half hour. It was absurd. It was just ice cream, not a <em>date</em>.</p><p>And yet, when she saw Rio waiting near the curb, two paper cups of ice cream in hand, something in her chest loosened.</p><p>Rio looked at ease, the low sunlight catching in her raven hair, changed from her uniform into dark jeans and a green t-shirt with some cartoonish white dog on the front. Her expression softened when she saw Agatha. “Right on time.”</p><p>“Slow day,” Agatha said.</p><p>Rio grinned, holding out one of the cups. “Mint chocolate chip. Extra chocolate sprinkles.”</p><p>Agatha took it, the paper cold against her palm. “You listened.”</p><p>“I told you I pay attention,” Rio said simply.</p><p>Agatha looked down at the ridiculous, joyful dessert and felt a small, traitorous smile tug at her mouth.<br/> <br/>“I don’t think I’ve had ice cream in years” Agatha said as she shook her head but took a spoonful anyway. <br/>The cold hit her tongue, sharp and sweet, the chocolate melting into mint in a way that was almost indecently good after the sterile bitterness of hospital coffee.</p><p>A low sound escaped her before she could stop it- soft, unguarded, a half-moan of pleasure. <br/>“Fuck, that’s good.”</p><p>Rio’s step faltered. Just slightly — enough that Agatha noticed.</p><p>When Agatha looked up, Rio was staring at her, eyes wide, a faint flush spreading high on her cheeks.</p><p>For a second, neither of them said anything. The sound of traffic hummed softly somewhere behind them, the evening air thick with heat and the faint sweetness of melting sugar.</p><p>Rio blinked, her voice softer than usual when she finally spoke. “You really don’t let yourself enjoy things often, do you?”</p><p>Agatha frowned slightly, thrown off by the gentleness of it. “What makes you say that?”</p><p>Rio gave a small shrug, looking down at her own cup. “It’s the way you said that. Like you’d forgotten what something good tasted like.”</p><p>The words landed heavier than Agatha expected. Too perceptive. Too honest. She forced a small, wry smile. “You’re reading too much into a frozen dessert.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio said quietly. “Or maybe I just notice these things, about you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched — so slight she doubted Rio even noticed. She spooned another bite of ice cream just to keep her hands busy, eyes flicking toward the streetlights instead of the woman beside her.</p><p>“You’re unusually observant for someone who claims to like quiet,” she said finally.</p><p>Rio smiled at that, the faint pink still colouring her cheeks. “Quiet doesn’t mean I’m not listening.”</p><p>Agatha huffed softly, trying not to let it show how much that line disarmed her. “You’re very strange, Vidal.”</p><p>“I get that a lot.” Rio said, smiling.</p><p>Agatha looked at her then, really looked — the steady, open gaze, the way her voice seemed to anchor everything around her without trying. She hadn’t meant to feel the flicker of warmth that rose in her chest, but there it was, unwelcome and alive.</p><p>She took another bite of ice cream to cover the silence, though this time, the sweetness lingered for a different reason entirely.</p><p>They fell into step together, leaving the hospital behind as the day softened into twilight. The street lamps were starting to blink awake, and the sound of crickets hummed somewhere in the distance. Agatha tried not to be overly conscious of how close their shoulders were, or how natural it felt to walk beside her.</p><p>After a few minutes, she asked, “Where exactly are we going?”</p><p>Rio’s smile was small but secretive. “You’ll see.”</p><p>She led them through a quiet side street lined with lilac bushes and cracked pavement until they reached the familiar brick outline of the fire station.</p><p>Agatha lifted a brow. “Planning to teach me some arson safety tips?”</p><p>“Not exactly,” Rio said, pushing through a side gate and motioning for her to follow. “Come on.”</p><p>Behind the station, a narrow metal staircase climbed toward the roof. The metal was cool to the touch, glinting faintly under the streetlight.</p><p>Agatha looked up at the rickety staircase, skeptical. “If this collapses, I’ll hold you personally responsible.”</p><p>Rio glanced over her shoulder, her grin visible even in the low light. “I’m trained to catch you.”</p><p>The words were said so lightly, so matter-of-factly, that they shouldn’t have meant anything at all. But something about the ease of them — the quiet confidence, the unspoken I’ve got you beneath the teasing — made Agatha’s pulse skip before she could stop it.</p><p>She hoped the dimness hid the heat that crept up the back of her neck. “Well,” she said briskly, clearing her throat, “let’s hope your training is unnecessary.”</p><p>Rio chuckled softly and kept climbing.</p><p>Agatha sighed, more at herself than at the stairs, and followed with one hand gripping the cool railing, the other clutching her now half-empty ice cream. She told herself it was ridiculous, this faint nervous flutter in her chest. She scaled a twelve-hour ER shift daily without breaking stride, but one smile from a firefighter and suddenly she was unsteady on metal steps.</p><p><em>Get a grip, Harkness</em>.</p><p>Still, she couldn’t help noticing the way Rio moved, so easy and sure, as if every motion was grounded in quiet strength. The kind of presence that made you feel, absurdly, like the air itself might catch you if you fell. An addictive high. </p><p>By the time they reached the top, Agatha’s heartbeat had evened out, but the warmth hadn’t left.</p><p>And when Rio turned back to offer her a hand — steady, patient, waiting — Agatha hesitated only a second before taking it.</p><p>It was warm, roughened slightly from work, and for one fleeting moment, the world below them disappeared.</p><p>It wasn’t what she expected. A few chairs, mismatched but comfortable, sat near the edge beneath a string of soft solar lights. A blanket was draped across the concrete, and the view stretched out before them — rooftops fading into the amber-blue horizon, the distant shimmer of the river catching the last of the sun.</p><p>Rio set her cup down and leaned on the railing. “This is where I go when the noise gets too loud.”</p><p>Agatha stood beside her, the wind tugging gently at her hair. The town below looked impossibly calm, like it belonged to another world entirely — one where she didn’t have to brace herself for loss every time the hospital pager went off.</p><p>“It’s so quiet,” she said finally.</p><p>Rio nodded. “That’s why I like it.”</p><p>Agatha glanced sideways at her. “You come up here often?”</p><p>“When I can,” Rio said. “It helps remind me that there’s more to life than just what I can see everyday”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. “That’s very philosophic.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “Maybe. But if you don’t believe in the quiet moments, the noise wins.”</p><p>Agatha turned back toward the skyline, her chest suddenly heavy and light at the same time. The air smelled like warm asphalt and grass, and for the first time in longer than she could remember, she felt her shoulders lower, her breath deepen.</p><p>“You can come up here whenever you want,” Rio said softly. “It’s better with company.”</p><p>“Secret clubhouse?” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio laughed quietly. “Don’t tell anyone.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into the smallest, realest smile. “Your secret’s safe with me.”</p><p>They stood there in comfortable silence, ice cream melting slowly between their fingers, the world around them shrinking to the sound of wind and the steady rhythm of their breathing.</p><p>And Agatha — practical, guarded, unwilling — realised she didn’t want to be anywhere else.</p><p>Rio chuckled softly and kept climbing, her voice drifting back over her shoulder. “You know, you look like you’re actually breathing for the first time all day.”</p><p>Agatha gave a dry huff, shaking her head. “Don’t tell anyone. I’ve got a reputation for being insufferably composed.”</p><p>Rio smiled over her shoulder. “I don’t think being human ruins your image, Agatha.”</p><p>The sound of her name again, so soft, steady, spoken with such unguarded warmth. It made Agatha’s breath falter. No one at the hospital said it like that. Most people didn’t say it at all.</p><p>She looked away toward the skyline, her pulse uneven. “It’s… not easy to stay human in my job,” she said finally. “You spend so much time pretending things don’t touch you, because if they do…” Her words drifted off into the wind.</p><p>Rio didn’t interrupt. She simply leaned against the railing beside her, close enough that Agatha could feel her quiet presence, her steady breath. The silence between them wasn’t awkward — it was patient, almost expectant.</p><p>“There was a boy, in Boston,” Agatha said at last, her voice quiet, fragile. “Nicky. I met him when he was two.”<br/>Rio turned toward her, listening — truly listening.</p><p>“His parents abandoned him,” Agatha went on. “He had a heart defect, one of the rare ones that no amount of surgery could quite fix. He spent most of his short life in hospital, hooked to machines that beeped more than he laughed.” Her lips curved into something soft and sad. “But he still managed to find joy in everything. He’d draw pictures of dinosaurs on his charts, tell me stories about dragons in the clouds outside his window.”</p><p>Her ice cream had melted, but she didn’t notice.</p><p>“I was a second year resident,” she continued. “I wasn’t supposed to get attached. But I did. I started visiting him outside the hospital, after shifts. Wherever they placed him next. I told myself I was checking in medically, but that was a lie. I just… missed him.”</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed gently. “You loved him.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat worked. “I did. I… thought about adopting him. I even filled out the first few forms. I was going to cut back my hours, take fewer cases.” She paused, exhaling shakily. “But there was always a reason to wait. Another emergency. Another late shift. I thought I had time.”</p><p>Her voice broke on the next words. “He died the day before his fifth birthday. I’d already bought his gift.”</p><p>The tears came fast, sudden and hot. She pressed the heel of her hand against her eyes, furious at herself for losing control — but once the wall cracked, it wouldn’t stop.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything. She just stepped closer and wrapped her arms around her, slow and sure. The scent of sandalwood and cedar wrapped around her too, grounding her.</p><p>Agatha stood stiffly at first, every instinct screaming to pull back, to keep composed — but then something inside her gave way. She let herself lean into Rio, her forehead against her shoulder, breath shaking.</p><p>“I should’ve been there,” she whispered. “He was alone.”</p><p>Rio’s voice was low and certain. “He wasn’t. You were there every day that mattered.”</p><p>Agatha let out a strangled sound that might have been a sob, her fingers clutching at the back of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>Rio just held her tighter. “You gave him love, Agatha. That’s what he would’ve remembered.”</p><p>They stood there in silence, the hum of the town distant below, the air warm against their skin.</p><p>When Agatha finally pulled back, her eyes were wet but steady. She wiped her face quickly, almost embarrassed.</p><p>Rio gave her a small smile — not pitying, not fragile, just real. </p><p>“You can talk about him, you know. You don’t have to keep carrying it alone.”</p><p>Agatha drew a long, uneven breath. For the first time since Nicky’s death, she didn’t feel like she was suffocating. “I haven’t told anyone most of that. Not even Lilia.”</p><p>Rio’s hand lingered briefly on hers. “Then I’m honoured you told me.”</p><p>Something unspoken passed between them — gratitude, trust, maybe the faintest flicker of something deeper.</p><p>Agatha looked at her, really looked at her, and for once didn’t try to hide the tremor in her smile. “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curved, soft and certain. “Anytime, Agatha.”</p><p>The last of the sunlight slipped away, leaving only the glow of the town below. And as they stood together on that quiet rooftop, Agatha felt the strange, unmistakable lightness of a weight she’d finally set down.</p><p>Something about Rio made her feel like she could finally exhale. </p><p>The constant hum of vigilance that lived beneath her skin seemed to quiet when Rio was near, as if her body recognised safety before her mind could. It was absurd and irrational… but undeniable.</p><p>She didn’t understand it, this gravity between them, or the strange calm that came with it. But as the last streak of sunlight disappeared behind the hills, Agatha knew one thing for certain-</p><p>She trusted Rio Vidal.</p><p>And that terrified her more than anything.</p>

<p><br/>By July, Westview had surrendered completely to summer.<br/> Heat shimmered over the asphalt, the air thick with the smell of cut grass and BBQ. Even the trees seemed to droop in exhaustion.</p><p>Agatha had no intention of getting involved in the town’s “Season of Giving” festivities, at least not until Lilia and Sharon Davis cornered her in the kitchen one evening.</p><p>“You’ll help, of course,” Sharon said brightly, her bracvelets clinking as she waved a clipboard. “We’re short on volunteers for the raffle table.”</p><p>Agatha looked up from her tea. “I’m a doctor, not a carnival worker.”</p><p>“Community spirit, dear,” Lilia said, smiling far too sweetly. “It won’t kill you to hand out tickets for an hour.”</p><p>“I hand out <em>life-saving</em> treatment daily,” Agatha muttered. “Surely that’s enough civic contribution.”</p><p>“It isn’t,” Lilia replied, placing a firm hand on her shoulder. “Besides, the fire department is helping raise funds this year. Perhaps you’ll find it… motivating.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes. “What’s that supposed to mean?”</p><p>Lilia just smiled, her expression far too innocent. “You’ll see.”</p><p>She did — unfortunately.</p><p>Two days later, a flyer appeared on the hospital bulletin board:<br/>🔥 <strong>WESTVIEW FIRE &amp; RESCUE FUNDRAISER — COMMUNITY CAR WASH!</strong> 🔥 </p><p><em>All proceeds go toward the children’s burn unit and summer festival fund</em>.</p><p>Below the bold red letters was a photograph clearly taken by someone with no concept of mercy — the crew lined up in sleeveless shirts, grinning for the camera.</p><p>Agatha stopped mid-sip, coffee hovering just below her mouth. “Oh for fuck’s sake,” she muttered, scanning the image. </p><p>“Ridiculous. Who designed this? It’s completely unprofessional.”</p><p>Still, her eyes lingered.</p><p>And then she saw her.</p><p>Rio stood near the corner of the lineup, her long, damp hair curling against her neck, water glinting on her tanned skin. She held a hose over one shoulder, expression somewhere between shy and daring, like she hadn’t realised how indecently photogenic she looked. Her toned biceps were flexed, glistening in the sunlight, and Agatha had to press her lips together to stop the entirely involuntary curl of a smile.</p><p>“This is absurd,” she told herself under her breath. “It’s objectification. Sexualised nonsense.”</p><p>Her gaze, however, betrayed her, dropping back to the photo, lingering too long on Rio’s shoulders, the easy curve of her smirk, the faint shadow at the hollow of her throat.</p><p>“Enjoying the view?”</p><p>Agatha startled, coffee sloshing perilously close to the rim. “Jesus fucking christ, Wanda.”</p><p>The redhead leaned casually against the counter beside her, a knowing grin already forming. “You’ve been oggling that flyer for a full thirty seconds. I counted.”</p><p>“I wasn’t oggling,” Agatha said sharply, too quickly.</p><p>“Mhm.” Wanda tilted her head, pretending to study the flyer. “Ah. Now I see what’s got you so… professionally concerned.”</p><p>“Concerned,” Agatha repeated, as if saying it would make it true. “Because this—” she gestured vaguely toward Rio’s picture, “—is utterly inappropriate.”</p><p>Wanda bit back a laugh. “You’re right. Terrible form. That hose placement is practically indecent.”</p><p>Agatha glared at her. “You’re enjoying this.”</p><p>“Only because you are.” Wanda’s grin widened. “You’re blushing, by the way.”</p><p>“I am not,” Agatha said, though the warmth creeping up her neck betrayed her. She lifted her coffee as a shield. “Don’t you have patients to see?”</p><p>“Plenty,” Wanda said, pushing off the counter. “But none nearly as entertaining as watching you pretend you’re not completely flustered by Firefighter Vidal’s forearms.”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her sip. “Get out.”</p><p>Wanda laughed all the way down the hall.</p><p>When she was finally gone, Agatha glanced back at the flyer. Her fingers hovered over the edge of the page, tempted to tear it down or maybe just fold the corner where Rio was.</p><p>Instead, she straightened it again, took a long breath, and muttered, “It’s for charity.”</p><p>And yet, as she walked away, she already knew she’d be there.</p><p> </p><p>When the say arrived and she arrived at the station, the scene was absurdly lively. There was music playing from a tinny speaker, suds flying, kids running through sprinklers while the firefighters worked in the sun.</p><p>Captain Rogers was manning the donation bucket. Tony was wearing aviators and a grin that could get him arrested, crutches propped up by his side.</p><p>And there, near the middle of it all, was Rio.</p><p>Her dark hair was tied up messily, a few strands sticking to her temple. Her T-shirt was soaked, clinging to her shoulders and back as she worked a sponge over the hood of a sedan. Her skin glistened faintly in the heat — tanned, strong, sunlit.</p><p>Agatha’s throat went dry.</p><p>Tony spotted her first. “Doctor Harkness! Come to support local heroes?”</p><p>“I came for a clean car,” she said crisply, stepping out of the driver’s seat. “Nothing more.”</p><p>“Sure you did,” Tony said, grinning. “We’ll take good care of her. Vidal—”</p><p>“I’ve got it,” Rio called, wiping her forehead with the back of her wrist before heading over.</p><p>Agatha’s heart gave one unhelpful thump.</p><p>“Doctor,” Rio said, smiling as she approached. “Didn’t expect to see you here.”</p><p>“Charity,” Agatha said, a little too quickly. “And my car was… dusty.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, that faint, amused half-smile tugging at her mouth. “Dusty. Right.”</p><p>She took the sponge from the bucket, water dripping from her fingers, and started on the windshield. </p><p>Agatha tried very hard not to stare at the strong line of Rio’s arms, the way sunlight caught in the droplets on her skin, the easy rhythm of her movements.</p><p>Tony hobbled by on crutches with a grin. “Doctor, you sure you’re not here for the view?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at him. “If you value your next check-up, Stark, keep walking.”</p><p>He laughed and retreated, whistling.</p><p>Rio glanced over, suppressing a smile. “You’re terrifying.”</p><p>“Only when provoked.”</p><p>Rio bent to rinse the sponge, and Agatha’s composure disintegrated another inch. The movement drew her eyes helplessly downward — to the way Rio’s tight shorts tightened over her thighs, the play of muscle beneath, the glint of sunlight off droplets running down her legs.</p><p>For one horrifying moment, Agatha actually forgot how to breathe.</p><p>Get a grip, she told herself, jaw tight. You are a doctor, not a deviant. She was washing your car, not starring in a fever dream.</p><p>To distract herself, she turned toward the other end of the lot. A group of women were crowded around Steve and Bucky, all laughter and gleaming sunglasses, like a scene out of some ridiculous small-town calendar. Agatha almost scoffed — <em>how pathetic</em> — until she caught sight of Rio again out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>Calm. Effortless. Absolutely devastating.</p><p>When Rio finally straightened, brushing the back of her wrist across her cheek, a streak of soap stayed behind, leaving a bright white smudge on sun-warmed skin.</p><p>“You’re all set,” she said, stepping back. “Should shine for a while.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated. “You missed a spot.”</p><p>Rio blinked, her eyes darting back to the now gleaming black Mercedes,“Where?”</p><p>Agatha stepped forward before she could talk herself out of it she raised her hand instinctively, brushing the pad of her thumb against Rio’s cheekbone.</p><p>The soap came away easily.</p><p>Her thumb lingered for just a fraction too long.</p><p>Rio went perfectly still.</p><p>So did Agatha.</p><p>For a second, the sounds of the car wash — the shouts, the music, the spray of hoses — faded into something distant and muffled.</p><p>Then Agatha pulled back, her composure snapping back into place as if it had never left. “There,” she said. “Now it’s perfect.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, her voice lower when she said, “Thanks, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand felt strangely empty. “Don’t mention it.”</p><p>She turned toward Captain Rogers, dropping a crisp bill into the donation bucket without a word, and climbed back into her spotless car.</p><p>As she drove away, the rearview mirror caught one last glimpse — Rio laughing at something Tony said, sunlight glinting off the water droplets in her hair.</p><p>Agatha tightened her grip on the wheel.<br/> It was just the heat, she told herself.<br/> Nothing more.</p><p>And still, her thumb tingled where it had touched her.</p><p>And yet, as she glanced in the mirror one last time, Rio still visible in the distance, watching her car pull away, eyes following until the Mercedes turned the corner, Agatha’s heart did something infuriating.</p><p>It fluttered.</p><p>A quiet, treacherous reminder that maybe she wasn’t as immune as she thought.</p><p><br/>By the time Agatha got home, the sun was beginning to set, the golden light spilling through the kitchen windows, catching in the glass jars lined up on the countre. The usual scent of rosemary and garlic drifted through the air, and laughter floated from the dining table.</p><p>Lilia and Sharon Davis were surrounded by papers, half-drunk glasses of wine, and what looked like the chaotic remains of festival planning- lists, ribbons, and a sketch of what might have been a stage layout.</p><p>“You’re home late,” Lilia said without looking up. “We were beginning to think you got lost.”</p><p>Agatha slipped off her shoes and hung her coat by the door. “I stopped by the station. The charity event.”</p><p>Sharon perked up. “The car wash? Wasn’t it marvellous?” She gestured dramatically with her pen. “Such community spirit! And such scenery, if you know what I mean.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow, reaching for a glass of water. “If you mean the fire crew, I imagine the turnout was alright.”</p><p>“Alright?” Sharon laughed. “Sweetie, half the town turned up to donate. I saw three women drop off perfectly clean cars.”</p><p>“Ridiculous,” Agatha muttered, sipping her water.</p><p>Lilia’s smile was quiet but far too knowing. “And yet, I suspect yours wasn’t among them.”</p><p>Agatha glanced away. “My car need washing.”</p><p>“Of course it did,” Lilia said lightly, twirling her pen. “Charitable <em>and</em> practical. How very you.”</p><p>Sharon grinned. “Oh, I’m sure it was practical. Did you happen to see that lovely firefighter of yours? The quiet one with the—”</p><p>Agatha cut in, too quickly. “I don’t <em>have</em> a firefighter.”</p><p>That earned her a long, silent look from both women.</p><p>Lilia hid her amusement behind a sip of wine. “Mhm. And if you did, hypothetically, would she have perhaps gotten you to stay longer than intended?”</p><p>Agatha set her glass down a bit too firmly. “I was there for fifteen minutes.”</p><p>“Fifteen minutes longer than you usually spend at social functions,” Lilia said, her tone mild.</p><p>“It was a car wash not a party.”</p><p>Sharon leaned her chin on her hand. “You’re blushing, Doctor.”</p><p>“I’m warm,” Agatha said sharply.</p><p>Lilia’s eyes softened. “Of course you are, dear. It’s the weather.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “You both sound insufferably pleased with yourselves.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “We simply appreciate progress when we see it.”</p><p>“There is no progress,” Agatha said, though her voice was quieter now.</p><p>Lilia tilted her head. “Then why are you smiling?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “I’m not.”</p><p>But she was, just barely, the kind of small, helpless smile that slipped out before reason could stop it.</p><p>Lilia caught it, of course. She always did.</p><p>“Well,” Sharon said, gathering her papers, “I’ll leave you two to your scheming. Agatha, do consider helping with the raffle booth, won’t you? We could use your… professional presence.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “If it will stop you from calling the house every day, fine.”</p><p>“Splendid!” Sharon beamed and swept out the door muttering something about pie eating.</p><p>When the door clicked shut, silence settled again. Lilia poured herself another splash of wine and gave Agatha that maddeningly patient look.</p><p>“Don’t,” Agatha warned.</p><p>“I didn’t say a word,” Lilia said.</p><p>“You’re <em>thinking</em> a word.”</p><p>“Only one,” Lilia admitted, smiling.</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Stop meddling. You’re infuriating you kmow that?”</p><p>“And you,” Lilia said softly, “are alive again. That’s all that matters.”</p><p>Agatha froze at that. For a moment, neither of them spoke.</p><p>Then she exhaled, rubbing her temples. “You over read things, as usual.”</p><p>“Perhaps,” Lilia murmured, turning one of her tarot cards idly on the table. </p><p>The Lovers.</p><p>“Goodnight, Lilia.”</p><p>“Sleep well, my girl.”</p><p>Agatha turned toward the stairs, her pulse unsteady and her cheeks still warm.</p><p>As she climbed, she caught herself brushing her thumb across her palm — the same hand that had touched Rio’s cheek.</p><p>She stared at it for a moment, then flexed her fingers as if trying to shake something off.</p><p>But she couldn’t.<br/> Not really.</p><p>Because the feeling lingered, faint as soap and sunlight.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By the time the Westview Summer Festival arrived, the entire town smelled of sunscreen, sugar, and nostalgia.</p><p>Banners fluttered lazily in the heat, paper lanterns hung from strings above the square, and every street hummed with laughter and music.</p><p>It was, Agatha decided, an utterly unnecessary level of cheerfulness.</p><p>She stood at the raffle booth beside Lilia, who was effortlessly charming the townsfolk while Agatha counted tickets with surgical precision. Her sleeves were rolled up, hair pinned tightly back, sunglasses shielding her from the glare.</p><p>“You look like you’re performing a tax audit,” Lilia murmured.</p><p>“I’m ensuring no one rigs the raffle,” Agatha said flatly. “Integrity is important.”</p><p>“Of course it is, dear,” Lilia replied, rolling her eyes and hiding a smile. “Though most people come for fun, not petty crime.”</p><p>Across the square, Sharon Davis was narrating a pie-eating contest with the energy of a sports commentator, voice carrying cheerfully over the crowd.</p><p>“And Ralph Bohner takes the lead- no, wait, Phil Jones is making a comeback! Look at that form, folks, that’s years of Thanksgiving practice right there! Oh, and Herb’s dropped his crust! Rookie mistake!”</p><p>The gathered townspeople whooped and clapped, children darting between stalls with faces sticky from lemonade and cotton candy. The air shimmered with heat and laughter, the smell of popcorn and engine grease blending in that uniquely Westview way.</p><p>The fire department’s dunk tank was the main attraction witha line of townspeople eagerly paying for the chance to send one of the firefighters plunging into cold water.</p><p>Agatha tried not to look.</p><p>She failed immediately.</p><p>Rio was there, of course sitting atop the dunk tank in a red T-shirt and dark scandalously short shorts, laughing as Bucky hurled a ball and missed spectacularly. The sunlight caught her skin, turning every drop of water into gold. She looked easy, relaxed, happy.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse tripped.</p><p>Lilia followed her gaze. “Something catch your eye?” she said softly.</p><p>Agatha didn’t reply. She focused on the raffle tickets instead, shuffling them like a deck of cards that could somehow distract her from the fact that her stomach had just done a ridiculous flip.</p><p>Moments later, Wanda and Jen appeared, both wearing matching festival badges.</p><p>“Look at you!” Jen grinned. “Raffle queen of Westview.”</p><p>“I was forced,” Agatha said.</p><p>Wanda leaned against the counter. “You’re glowing.”</p><p>“It’s probably heatstroke,” Agatha deadpanned.</p><p>Jen snorted. “Sure it is. Not the sight of a certain firefighter about to get dunked?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a withering look. “Yousmall town people are insufferable.”</p><p>“Adorable, actually,” Jen said.</p><p>Before Agatha could retort, a roar of laughter went up from the crowd. Bucky had finally hit the target. Rio disappeared into the water with a splash, surfacing a moment later with a laugh that carried across the square — low, bright, and entirely too infectious.</p><p>Agatha didn’t realise she was smiling until Wanda nudged her.</p><p>“You know,” Wanda murmured, “for someone who claims not to enjoy fun, you’ve been staring at it for a solid minute.”</p><p>Agatha turned sharply. “I’m merely… ensuring proper safety protocols.”</p><p>“Of course you are,” Wanda said, voice rich with amusement.</p><p>Lilia excused herself to go check on the main stage, leaving Agatha manning the booth alone. She managed five minutes of peace before she heard a familiar voice behind her.</p><p>“Doctor Harkness.”</p><p>Her breath caught, which was ridiculous, really. She turned, schooling her face into neutrality.</p><p>Rio stood there, towel around her shoulders, damp hair curling against her neck. Droplets still clung to her skin, and her T-shirt was plastered to her torso in a way that made Agatha’s brain temporarily short-circuit.</p><p>“Firefighter Vidal,” she managed, cool and crisp, averting her eyes back to the pile of raffle tickets. “I see you’ve been… immersed in community service.”</p><p>Rio smiled, slow and warm. “You could say that. You enjoying the festival?”</p><p>“Immensely,” Agatha lied.</p><p>“Mm.” Rio’s eyes sparkled. “Does that mean I’ll see you at the bonfire later?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “The bonfire?”</p><p>“End of the night,” Rio said. “Everyone gathers near the field. Music, lights. It’s nice.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, every instinct screaming no. Crowds, noise, sentimentality, none of it was her scene.</p><p>But Rio’s eyes held hers, steady and patient, like she was giving her the option to say yes to something that wasn’t duty for once.</p><p>“I’ll… consider it,” Agatha said finally.</p><p>Rio’s smile deepened, small, knowing. “That’s good enough for me.”</p><p>Then she nodded, the faintest blush creeping into her cheeks. “I should get back before Steve volunteers me again.”</p><p>“Go,” Agatha said, though her voice came out softer than intended.</p><p>As Rio walked away, the sunlight caught the back of her shoulders, and Agatha felt something she hadn’t in a long time — the quiet pull of wanting to be somewhere other than safe.</p><p>By the time the raffle table was packed away and the sun had dipped, the square had transformed into something out of a dream. </p><p>Lanterns swung gently from tree branches, glowing like low-hanging stars. The air smelled of roasted corn, woodsmoke, and sugar, and laughter drifted from every corner of Wedstview Green.</p><p>Lilia hovered by the front door of the cottage, passing Agatha as she arrived home. </p><p>“I promised Sharon I’d help light the paths by the field,” she said, looping her shawl over her arm. “You should come by later, Agatha. It does the soul good to see people happy.”</p><p>Agatha gave a dry hum. “Happiness is rarely contagious.”</p><p>Lilia smiled, her eyes warm with the kind of patience only age could earn. “Maybe you’ve just forgotten what it feels like.”</p><p>“I remember perfectly well,” Agatha said. “I just prefer my own company.”</p><p>“That’s what you always say,” Lilia replied, already heading for the door. “Come if you want to be reminded what warmth feels like.”</p><p>The door closed behind her, leaving Agatha in a silence that felt too still.</p><p>She told herself she wasn’t going.<br/> She’d done her part for community morale. She’d smiled politely, raised money, even tolerated small talk. </p><p>Enough.</p><p>But then the faint pulse of distant music reached her, the low hum of a guitar, laughter carried on the night breeze and she found herself standing before her wardrobe again.</p><p>She stared at her reflection, frowning. The usual choices of a starched shirt and pressed trousers suddenly felt suffocating. Her hand hovered for a long moment before she reached for something buried near the back- a plum linen dress she hadn’t worn in years.</p><p>It was soft, sleeveless, and made her feel strangely unarmored. When she let her hair down loose and curling naturally around her shoulders she barely recognised herself.</p><p>“You look ridiculous,” she muttered to the mirror. But her voice lacked conviction.</p><p>Ten minutes later, she was locking the front door behind her.</p><p><br/>The festival was alive when she arrived with a golden light spilling across the green, couples dancing in the grass, and children racing past with sparklers that left silver trails in the air.</p><p>Agatha hesitated at the edge of it all, heart ticking faster than it should. Then she saw her.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She’d changed into an off white linen shirt, buttoned loosely , beige cargo shorts, and clean white Converse. Her dark hair was down now, curling softly at the ends, still a little damp from the dunk tank. The firelight painted her skin in warm tones, and for a moment, Agatha forgot how to breathe.</p><p>Rio was laughing at something Steve said, her hand nursing a plastic cup filled with beer. But when she turned and caught sight of Agatha, the laughter faltered — her smile softening into something slower, almost reverent.</p><p>For the first time since Agatha had known her, Rio looked completely <em>speechless</em>.</p><p>The look made Agatha’s stomach twist. She hadn’t expected that. She hadn’t expected any of this.</p><p>Rio took a small step forward, like she might come over but then another voice cut through the noise.<br/>“Doctor Harkness!”</p><p>Wanda’s voice — light and familiar. She approached with Chief Romanoff at her side, the two of them moving easily through the crowd.</p><p>“Enjoying the festival?” Wanda asked, cheeks flushed from laughter.</p><p>“I’m… present,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Chief Romanoff gave her a brief, polite nod. “Good to see you out of scrubs, Doctor. Didn’t think you were the mingling type.”</p><p>“I’m not,” Agatha said simply.</p><p>Wanda smiled, her gaze flicking toward Natasha with something soft in it. “She dragged me out here,” she said.</p><p>“I didn’t drag,” Natasha murmured. “I encouraged.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched with the faintest smirk. “Encouragement seems to suit you, Chief.”</p><p>Natasha’s answering smile was brief but genuine. “Don’t tell the department. I’ve a reputation to uphold.”</p><p>They moved on after a few more pleasantries, Wanda throwing Agatha a parting wink before looping her arm through Natasha’s. The two disappeared into the crowd, leaving Agatha momentarily alone again.</p><p>She turned back and then froze.</p><p>Across the firelight, Yelena had joined Rio, tugging her playfully toward the bar stand. The younger nurse was grinning, her blonde hair swinging as she poured them both drinks from a jug of something suspiciously pink.</p><p>Rio looked bemused but didn’t resist, her expression shy, a little out of place amid Yelena’s bright chatter. </p><p>When she laughed, tilting her head back, Agatha felt something low in her chest tighten unexpectedly.</p><p>It was ridiculous.<br/> Entirely irrational.</p><p>Agatha told herself that for the fourth time as she found her eyes drifting toward the bar stand.</p><p>She didn’t even notice Alice, Jen, and Kate until they were practically beside her.</p><p>“Well, well,” Jen said, voice lilting with amusement. “Isn’t this an interesting view?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, startled. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Alice followed Jen’s gaze, catching the line of Agatha’s sight straight to Rio and Yelena. Her lips curved into a small, knowing smile. “Oh,” she said softly, the kind of oh that suggested she’d just found a puzzle piece.</p><p>Kate, standing beside them, wasn’t paying attention. Her eyes were locked entirely on Yelena. “God, she’s gorgeous,” she murmured under her breath.</p><p>Jen snorted. “Kate, you’ve been staring at Yelena for five minutes.”</p><p>“Four,” Kate corrected automatically, cheeks flushed. “And it’s not staring. It’s… quiet appreciation.”</p><p>“Uh-huh,” Jen said, grinning. “Quiet appreciation for the woman you’ve been in love with for what, a year now?”</p><p>Kate groaned. “Will you <em>stop</em> saying that out loud?”</p><p>Alice laughed softly, slipping her arm through Jen’s. “She’s not wrong, though. You’ve been pining so long it’s practically part of your personality.”</p><p>Kate covered her face with both hands. “I’m leaving.”</p><p>“No, you’re staying,” Jen said, looping an arm around her shoulders. “Who knows, maybe Yelena will finally notice you if you keep staring hard enough.”</p><p>Agatha, meanwhile, had gone perfectly still — which, for her, was as good as admitting guilt.</p><p>Alice’s gaze slid back to her, eyes glinting. “Though I’m starting to think we’re<em> not</em> the only ones noticing that bar.”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped around. “I beg your pardon?”</p><p>Jen smirked. “Oh, come on, Agatha. You’ve been staring holes through Rio and Yelena since we walked up.”</p><p>“I was not staring,” Agatha said crisply. “I was observing.”</p><p>“Observing,” Jen echoed, amused. “Sure. For… medical reasons?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice went cool. “It’s called situational awareness. Perhaps you’ve heard of it.”</p><p>Alice chuckled under her breath, leaning toward Jen. “She’s defensive. That’s adorable.”</p><p>“I am not defensive,” Agatha said.</p><p>Jen raised a perfectly shaped brow. “You just snapped at us for saying you were staring.”</p><p>Kate, finally looking away from Yelena, frowned. “Wait—what are we talking about? Who’s staring at who?”</p><p>“No one,” Agatha said immediately.</p><p>“Everyone,” Jen corrected. “Yelena’s flirting, Kate’s pining, and Agatha’s pretending she’s not watching any of it like a hawk.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, composed but pink at the edges. “You three are incorrigible.”</p><p>Alice smiled sweetly. “You love us.”</p><p>“That’s debatable,” Agatha muttered, lifting her glass to her lips.</p><p>Jen tilted her head toward the bar again. “Well, whatever it is you’re not watching, it looks like Yelena’s succeeding. She’s got Rio laughing now.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond, but her jaw tightened slightly.</p><p>Alice noticed — just barely — and filed it away with quiet intrigue.</p><p>Kate groaned into her hands.</p><p>Jen, oblivious, grinned and lifted her drink. “To summer festivals, where everyone’s a little too drunk and a little too obvious.”</p><p>They clinked cups, and Agatha managed a dry, noncommittal smile, eyes flicking once more toward the bar despite herself.</p><p>And there Rio was again, laughing softly as Yelena leaned suspiciously close.</p><p> </p><p><br/>The bonfire crackled in the centre of the field, its light rippling gold across the crowd. Children darted around with sparklers, their laughter breaking against the low hum of the band’s music. The heat of the flames carried a familiar, comforting smell of smoke, pine and summer earth.</p><p>Lilia sat in a folding chair near the edge of the firelight, shawl draped over her shoulders, a paper cup of wine in hand. She looked entirely at ease, like she belonged here, a part of the town’s fabric in a way Agatha never had.</p><p>“Ah,” she said without looking up. “I was beginning to wonder when you’d find me.”</p><p>Agatha eased down into the chair beside her. “You assumed I would.”</p><p>“I hoped,” Lilia corrected, smiling faintly. “You’ve been quiet tonight.”</p><p>“I’m surrounded by loud people,” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>“Mm,” Lilia hummed, eyes still on the fire. “That’s not what I meant.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. Her gaze drifted over the flames, but inevitably, it wandered back across the field.</p><p>There was Yelena, still at the bar stand, animated and laughing. And there was Rio, standing close beside her, smiling that same soft, open smile that seemed to light up everything around her.</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest ached.</p><p>Lilia followed her line of sight and — as always understood before Agatha could form words.</p><p>“Ah,” she said softly, sipping her wine. “So that’s what this is.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened. “What <em>what</em> is?”</p><p>“Agatha dear, in all the years I’ve known you, I haven’t seen you look at someone the way you look at Rio before.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>“Let that wall down my girl,” Lilia murmured, her tone gentle, not scolding. “Let your heart feel what it wants.”</p><p>Agatha stared into the fire. The flames danced, licking upward as if reaching for something they couldn’t quite touch. “And what if it wants something it can’t have?”</p><p>Lilia smiled sadly. “Agatha, I’ve also seen the way that girl looks at you. I’ve known Rio for years. She’s never shown interest in anyone before you came alonmg.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “She seems pretty interested in someone right now.”</p><p>Lilia followed her gaze toward the bar stand, where Yelena was laughing brightly and animated while Rio stood beside her, smiling politely.</p><p>“She’s just being polite,” Lilia said softly. “Look closer. Her smile’s not even reaching her eyes.”</p><p>Agatha frowned, watching. And sure enough, once the laughter faded, Rio’s smile lingered only a heartbeat before her expression softened — distracted, searching.</p><p>“She keeps looking around,” Lilia said. “Like she’s waiting for someone.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse jumped. She forced a breath, trying to convince herself otherwise. “She’s probably looking for her captain. Or Alice. Or—”</p><p>Lilia cut her a look that silenced her mid-sentence.</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, chewing lightly on her fingernail, an old habit she thought she’d long since broken. She didn’t notice herself doing it until Lilia’s hand brushed hers gently.</p><p>“Stop thinking,” Lilia murmured. “For once, just… feel.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze drifted back to Rio. The firefighter was still scanning the crowd slowly, deliberate, eyes sweeping over faces until, for a split second, they seemed to meet Agatha’s across the distance.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>Then Rio looked away, her brow furrowing faintly, as if trying to place a thought that wouldn’t settle.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, long and shaky, and muttered, “You’re reading too much into things.”</p><p>Lilia smiled. The kind of smile that belonged to someone who’d already decided she’d be the hand of fate.</p><p>“Oh, perhaps,” she said lightly, swirling her cup. “But sometimes fate needs a nudge.”</p><p>Before Agatha could respond, Lilia tipped the last of her cup into the fire.</p><p>The flames leapt instantly higher, a burst of heat and light erupting upward with a soft whoosh. The crowd gasped, turning instinctively toward the flare.</p><p>Within seconds, half the fire department was on alert — including Rio.</p><p>“Lilia!” Agatha hissed, glaring. “What the fuck are you—”</p><p>But it was too late.</p><p>Rio was already sprinting across the field, towel from the bar still slung over her shoulder, eyes sharp with concern. “Everything okay here?” she asked, breathless as she reached them.</p><p>Lilia blinked up at her innocently. “Oh, dear me, I might’ve gotten a bit too enthusiastic with my drink.”</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose. “You <em>threw it</em> i<em>nto the fire</em>, Lilia, what the fuck was even in there, <em>gasoline</em>?”</p><p>Rio crouched to check the edges of the pit, her hand brushing over the grass to make sure nothing had caught. “No harm done,” she said after a moment, looking up and straight into Agatha’s eyes. “You both all right?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, but no sound came out.</p><p>Her heart was still racing, though she couldn’t tell if it was from the burst of flame or from the nearness of the woman in front of her — the faint smell of smoke and pine clinging to her shirt, the worry softening her expression.</p><p>Lilia, of course, noticed everything. She rose with a small, satisfied smile. “We’re perfectly fine, Rio dear. Thank you for coming so quickly.”</p><p>Rio stood, nodding, still watching Agatha. “Of course. Just glad you’re both okay.”</p><p>Lilia touched Agatha’s shoulder lightly as she passed. “I think you two should sit for a while,” she said, her tone deceptively casual. “I’m going to get another drink.”</p><p>Before Agatha could reply, she was gone, slipping into the hum of the crowd with that knowing sway of her shawl.</p><p>The night settled thick and golden around them in her absence. The bonfire burned low, its crackle softened by the hush of summer air. Beyond the circle of light, the festival still thrummed with laughter, fiddles, and the faint clink of glass mixed with the sound of children chasing fireflies. Here, though, it felt distant, muted, as if the world had drawn a soft curtain around just the two of them.</p><p>Rio crouched near the fire, her movements unhurried. The orange glow painted over her skin, catching on the curve of her jaw and the dark curls loose around her temples. She poked at the embers with a stick, eyes intent on the flame.</p><p>“Looks stable,” she murmured, brushing a curl from her face. A faint smile tugged at her lips. “Lilia nearly gave half the fire crew a heart attack.”</p><p>“She has that effect on people,” Agatha said, settling onto the blanket. “Her hobbies include meddling and theatrics.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “Seems like it works for her.”</p><p>Agatha hummed, a small, knowing sound. “She said she’s known you for years.”</p><p>Rio nodded, lowering herself to sit beside her. “She and Sharon are always dropping food at the station. Lilia’s kind of the town’s patron saint of comfort meals.”</p><p>Agatha gave a soft snort. “And cryptic advice.”</p><p>“She’s not wrong, though,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her. “About what?”</p><p>Rio met her eyes, steady and warm. </p><p>“About you.”</p><p>Agatha looked away too quickly. “You barely know me.”</p><p>Rio’s voice dropped a little, softer. “Maybe. But maybe I’ve seen enough.”</p><p>That made Agatha’s pulse stutter, and she wasn’t sure she liked how easily it did. To distract herself, she nodded toward the bar. “You seem to be getting on well with Nurse Belova.”</p><p>Rio blinked, surprised, then smiled. “Yelena? Oh — no, we’re just friends. She’s… persistent, that’s all.”</p><p>“Persistent,” Agatha repeated dryly. “Is that what they call it now?”</p><p>Rio laughed under her breath, a low, warm sound that made Agatha’s stomach tighten unexpectedly. “Yelena flirts with everyone,” Rio said. “It’s just her nature.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly, eyes sharp. “And you? Do you flirt with all your friends?”</p><p>Rio turned toward her fully now, amusement glinting in her brown eyes. “No,” she said, voice dropping softer. “Just stubborn doctors who don’t seem to take kindly to people flirting with them.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught — quiet, involuntary.</p><p>She turned to look at her, startled by the honesty in Rio’s tone, the faint nervousness that softened the edges of her smile. “That’s… bold,” Agatha managed.</p><p>Rio’s smile grew, gentler this time. “Not something Im used to hearing.”</p><p>The air between them shifted — warmer, closer.</p><p>Rio’s hand moved slightly, fingers brushing against the blanket until they came to rest next to Agatha’s. </p><p>Just touching. Not enough to startle, but enough to feel.</p><p>Agatha froze. Her pulse thrummed in her throat, the warmth from the fire suddenly unbearable. She should’ve pulled away, said something cutting, but instead she just breathed — slow, shaky.</p><p>“Rio,” she said softly, the name slipping out like an exhale.</p><p>Rio’s face lit up. She turned to her fully, eyes bright. “That’s the first time you’ve ever said my name.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved, small and unguarded. “It is?”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio murmured, her smile soft but radiant. “You should say it more often. It sounds nice when you do.”</p><p>The words hung between them, warm and unguarded.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. The night pressed close, the firelight flickering against Rio’s face, the faint smell of cedar and summer air tangling in her senses. Everything else blurred away.</p><p>For once, her mind — the sharp, clinical machine she trusted above all — went quiet.<br/> All she could hear was Rio’s slow, steady breathing.<br/> All she could see were Rio’s brown eyes, reflecting the flames.</p><p>She wanted to move closer. Just a little.</p><p>Her body leaned before her reason could stop it.</p><p><em>Don’t</em>, her mind hissed.<em> Don’t do this. Don’t make it real</em>.<br/> But another smaller voice, desperate and hers whispered, Please.</p><p>Rio didn’t move away. Her hand, still next to Agatha’s, brushed forward, a light, deliberate touch that sent something electric spiralling up her arm.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse was a drumbeat in her ears.<br/> She could feel herself trembling, on the edge of something terrifyingly human.</p><p><em>Just kiss her</em>, that voice pleaded. <em>For once, just</em>—</p><p>A shout split the air.</p><p>“Somebody help! She’s collapsed!”</p><p>The sound sliced straight through the moment. Agatha’s head snapped toward the commotion — a crowd gathering near the picnic tables under the lanterns.</p><p>Then someone yelled, “We need a doctor! Now!”</p><p>Everything inside her shifted, her instinct overriding everything else. She was moving before the thought even formed.</p><p>She bolted across the grass, the crowd parting as she ran, heart pounding. Rio was right behind her, her footsteps quick, solid, close.</p><p>“Lilia,” someone cried. “It’s Lilia Calderu— she just fell—”</p><p>Agatha’s blood went cold.</p><p>She dropped to her knees beside the blanket where Lilia lay motionless, her shawl fallen to one side, her eyes closed, lips faintly blue.</p><p>“Lilia,” Agatha gasped, already checking her pulse. Nothing. “No, no, no—”</p><p>Her hands moved automatically, heel to sternum, locking her elbows. “Call it in!” she barked. “Now!”</p><p>“I’ve got it!” Rio’s voice came from behind her, sharp and steady, already pulling out her radio.</p><p>People scattered. Someone — Jen, still in her festival dress — knelt on the other side, pale and shaking. </p><p>“Oh my God—”</p><p>“Move back,” Agatha said, voice breaking around the edges. “Give me space.”</p><p>“Agatha,” came another low, calm voice. Chief Romanoff. She crouched down, hand hovering near Agatha’s shoulder. “Let us—”</p><p>“No!” Agatha snapped, pumping faster, every compression punctuated by a tremor of fear. “I’ve got her. Don’t— don’t touch her.”</p><p>Romanoff’s eyes flickered with something like understanding. “Okay,” she said quietly. “Then talk to me, Doctor.”</p><p>“ Patient is unresponsive. No pulse. Suspected cardiac arrest,” Agatha said mechanically, her voice tight and ragged. “We’re starting compressions. Prepare epinephrine.”</p><p>Jen’s voice cracked. “Ambulance is on the way—”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha said, counting under her breath. Thirty compressions. Two breaths. Repeat.</p><p>Her vision blurred — sweat, tears, she wasn’t sure. “Come on, Lilia,” she whispered. “Not like this. Not you.”</p><p>Rio was beside her now, kneeling, ready with the med bag. “Agatha,” she said softly, steady as stone. “Breathe.”</p><p>“I am breathing!” Agatha barked, voice shaking. “She’s not.”</p><p>Her arms ached, but she didn’t stop. Couldn’t. Every press felt like trying to push life back into the only person who’d ever truly been home.</p><p>Romanoff reached forward again. “Harkness—”</p><p>“Don’t!” Agatha’s voice cracked. “Please, just— don’t.”</p><p>Something in it - that raw, breaking edge — froze everyone around her.</p><p>Then—</p><p>“Got a pulse!” Jen said suddenly, her fingers pressed to Lilia’s throat. “It’s faint but— she’s got one!”</p><p>Agatha froze, her whole body trembling as she bent over Lilia, listening.<br/> A weak, uneven beat under her ear.</p><p>“Okay,” Agatha whispered, tears spilling down her cheeks before she could stop them. “Okay. Stay with me, Lils. Come on, stay with me.”</p><p>Sirens wailed in the distance, growing louder, closer.</p><p>When the paramedics arrived, Agatha was already barking vitals, her tone clipped and urgent even through her shaking.</p><p>“She’s in sinus rhythm, weak pulse, probable myocardial infarction,” Agatha said. “I’m riding with her.”</p><p>Romanoff nodded. “Go. We’ll meet you there.”</p><p>Rio helped lift the stretcher, her movements efficient, but her face pale with worry. When they reached the ambulance, she caught Agatha’s arm briefly, grounding her.</p><p>“She’s alive because of you,” Rio said softly.</p><p>Agatha met her eyes- wide, wet, wild. “She’s alive <em>for now</em>.”</p><p>Rio’s voice gentled. “Then let’s keep her that way.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, then climbed into the back of the ambulance, her hands still pressed to Lilia’s wrist, her voice a hoarse whisper against the sirens’ scream.</p><p>“Hold on, Lils,” she murmured. “Please.”</p><p>The doors slammed shut, sealing her inside with the rhythmic beeping of monitors and the heavy thud of her own pulse. Through the small back window, she caught one last glimpse of Rio standing frozen by the firelight, worry carved into every line of her face.</p><p>As the ambulance pulled away, Rio grew smaller, her figure swallowed by the blur of flashing red and gold. A heartbeat ago, Agatha had been on the edge of something almost beautiful- - laughter, warmth, a near-kiss under the summer sky. </p><p>Now, all that remained was the echo of it, slipping further away with every turn of the wheels.</p>

<p>The hospital lights were brutally sharp and cold, washing everything in sterile white. The hum of the fluorescent bulbs filled the air as the paramedics wheeled Lilia through the emergency doors.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was steady, automatic. “Seventy-two-year-old female, cardiac arrest at the scene. Resuscitated after four minutes of CPR. Pulse weak, irregular, likely myocardial infraction.”</p><p>The ER doctor on duty stepped forward. “We’ll take her, Doctor Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands gripped the rail of the stretcher. “She’s unstable—”</p><p>“We’ve got her,” the doctor said gently, nodding to the nurses. “Go clean up, Agatha. You did your part.”</p><p>Her fingers refused to release the metal. For a second she just stood there, the world narrowing to the uneven beep of the heart monitor. Then she forced herself to step back.</p><p>She didn’t go far. Just outside the curtain, she stood watching the team move with practiced speed — oxygen, nitro, IV line, ECG leads. The erratic blip of Lilia’s heart filled the space, jagged and uncertain.</p><p>She had walked into this room every day for months, moved through it with detached efficiency. She knew every corner, from the placement of the crash cart, the crack in the linoleum near Bay Three, down to the hum of the old ventilator that needed replacing. It was her world, her controlled chaos.</p><p>But tonight, it all looked different. The lights were too bright, the sound too loud. The air that had always smelled of antiseptic and adrenaline now felt suffocating. Every detail she’d once dismissed as routine suddenly cut sharp against her senses — the squeak of shoes on tile, the hiss of the oxygen, the click of a pen against a clipboard.</p><p>She was seeing it as a family member now, not as a doctor. From the wrong side of the curtain.</p><p>Her chest ached with the realisation.</p><p><em>She’ll be fine</em>, Agatha told herself. <em>She has to be fine</em>.</p><p><br/>The doors burst open again five minutes later.</p><p>Wanda was first — still in her sundress from the festival, hair mussed from the run. Natasha followed, composed as ever in jeans and a white shirt, her face set in calm urgency. Behind them came Jen, her heels clacking across the tile, Alice clutching her paramedic bag, Kate looking pale and wide-eyed.</p><p>And Rio — in her linen shirt and beige shorts, breathless, short curls messy from the humid night air.</p><p>Agatha looked up, startled by the sight of all of them together.</p><p>“She’s in Treatment One,” she said automatically, voice rough. “They’re working on her.”</p><p>Alice pressed a hand to her chest, visibly shaken. “Is she—”</p><p>“She’s alive,” Agatha cut in. “Barely.”</p><p>Wanda moved closer, her voice soft but firm. “Agatha, you got her this far. You saved her life.”</p><p>“She’s not saved until she wakes up,” Agatha snapped. Her voice cracked at the end.</p><p>Natasha stepped forward, calm and controlled, but her gaze was sharp with concern. “Dr Harkness,” she said quietly. “You need to take a step back.”</p><p>Agatha’s head turned sharply. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“You’re too close,” Natasha said gently. “You’re not objective right now.”</p><p>“I’m not leaving her.”</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>But those words broke something. It was the same thing they’d told her in Boston.</p><p>She could almost hear it echoing through time- <em>You’re too close. Step away</em>. <em>We’ll take over from here</em>.<br/>The image of Nicky’s face flooded back in, the desperate gasps, the flatline, the impossible silence that had followed.</p><p><em>Please, let me try. I can save him. Don’t take him from me</em>.</p><p>The monitors in Lilia’s room beeped unevenly, pulling her halfway between past and present. The floor swayed.</p><p>Wanda said something, but the words blurred.</p><p>Agatha turned, walking fast down the corridor. She reached the on-call room and slammed the door shut behind her, leaning against the opposite wall as her breath came too quick, too shallow.</p><p>Her hands trembled violently. Her chest hurt. The sterile smell of antiseptic filled her lungs.</p><p>She pressed her palms over her face.<br/> Not again. Please, not again.</p><p>The tears came suddenly, like something bursting loose, like years of control collapsing all at once.</p><p>The door opened quietly.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>She looked up. Rio stood in the doorway, her chest rising and falling, cheeks flushed and eyes steady.</p><p>“How did you—” Agatha began, but her voice broke.</p><p>Rio took a tentative step forward. “Wanda said you like to hide in here.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha rasped.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “You’re not.”</p><p>Agatha turned away, gripping the edge of the cot. “She’s all I have left, Rio. If I lose her—” Her voice caught. “If I lose her, I don’t know how to come back from that.”</p><p>Rio crossed the small space between them without hesitation. “You’re not losing her.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, bitter and wet. “You can’t know that.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said softly, “but you gave her a fighting chance.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath trembled. “I can’t go through it again. Not again.”</p><p>Rio’s face softened with quiet understanding. “I know,” she murmured. “You don’t have to explain.”</p><p>The words cracked something open in Agatha. She shook her head, voice breaking. “It feels the same as… The waiting. The not knowing.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, her voice steady, low. “But she’s still here. You brought her back. That’s different this time.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, a sound caught between grief and disbelief. Her body shook once, hard.<br/>And then Rio simply stepped forward and wrapped her arms around her.</p><p>Agatha froze for just a heartbeat and then folded.</p><p>The sobs came rough and silent, shaking through her whole frame.</p><p>Rio held her tighter, one hand in her hair, the other pressed to her back, steady and sure. “It’s okay,” she whispered. “You don’t have to hold it together right now.”</p><p>Agatha buried her face in Rio’s shoulder, breathing in the faint scent of smoke, soap, and pine. The smell was grounding, alive, real.</p><p>Rio didn’t try to fix it. She didn’t say <em>it’ll be okay</em> or <em>stay strong</em>. She just held her, her heartbeat slow and steady under Agatha’s ear.</p><p>After a while, Agatha’s breathing began to even out.</p><p>“She’s strong,” Rio murmured. “You know that better than anyone. You’ll see her again soon.”</p><p>Agatha nodded faintly, voice cracking. “I can’t lose her.”</p><p> </p><p><br/>The hospital had fallen into the deep hush of early mornin and that strange, sacred hour between night and dawn when even machines seemed to quiet.</p><p>Lilia lay in a private room now, her face pale but peaceful under the soft monitor glow. The steady rhythm of her heart filled the silence, an unsteady metronome that still made Agatha flinch every few beats.</p><p>She sat in a chair pulled close to the bed, her posture too rigid for someone who hadn’t slept in nearly twenty hours. Her lab coat was folded over the backrest, her scrubs now worn like armour.</p><p>Her fingers itched to keep checking Lilia’s vitalks, to do something, but the on-duty team had been clear, she needed to rest. To wait.</p><p>She was terrible at both.</p><p>The door opened quietly.</p><p>“Hey.”</p><p>Rio stepped inside, holding two paper cups and a hesitant kind of smile. She’d changed into an old FDWV hoodie and sweatpants.</p><p>Agatha blinked up at her, voice hoarse. “What are you still doing here?”</p><p>“Bribing the on-call nurse,” Rio said softly. “She said you hadn’t moved for hours.”</p><p>She handed her a cup. The rich smell of coffee hit Agatha first, dark, strong, slightly burnt. Her favourite.</p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured, fingers brushing Rio’s briefly as she took it.</p><p>Rio sank into the chair beside her, careful not to disturb the quiet. “How is she?”</p><p>“Stable,” Agatha said. “They’ve got her on fluids, beta-blockers, oxygen. She’s holding.”</p><p>Rio nodded, eyes flicking toward the bed. “She looks peaceful.”</p><p>Agatha followed her gaze. For the first time in hours, she let herself exhale properly. “She does.”</p><p>They sat in silence for a while — sipping coffee, listening to the rhythmic beeping, the hum of the air vents.</p><p>Then Rio spoke, voice low. “You love her a lot.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved faintly, a tired smile. “She’s been my whole world since I was twelve.”</p><p>Rio turned slightly, listening.</p><p>Agatha stared down at her coffee cup, the paper softening under her grip. “My mother was… not a good person. Cold, cruel, controlling. When she decided she’d had enough of me, she sent me to stay with Lilia. Just for the summer, supposedly.”</p><p>She swallowed. “But I never went back.”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak, she just watched her with that same patient quiet that made it easy to keep talking.</p><p>“She took me in like it was the most natural thing in the world. Fed me, scolded me, made me do the dishes like any other kid. I think she was the first person who ever looked at me and didn’t see a burden.”</p><p>Her voice faltered, softening. “I owe her everything. Every good part of me is because of her.”</p><p>Rio’s hand moved slowly, deliberate, until it rested gently over Agatha’s.</p><p>Agatha froze for a moment, instinctively wary of being touched, but Rio’s hand was warm, grounding.</p><p>“She’s lucky to have you,” Rio said quietly. “And you’re lucky to have her. That kind of love doesn’t happen twice.”</p><p>Agatha stared at their hands her pale fingers under Rio’s darker, calloused ones and for the first time all night, she didn’t pull away.</p><p>Her shoulders sagged, the exhaustion finally breaking through. “I don’t know what I’d do if she didn’t—”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand, gentle but firm. “Don’t,” she said softly. “She’s still here.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, eyes wet but no longer spilling. “You should be at home.”</p><p>“So should you,” Rio murmured. “But I’m staying.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head, meeting her gaze — steady, unflinching, impossibly kind.</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “Because you shouldn’t be alone right now.”</p><p>Something in Agatha cracked again, not breaking this time, but loosening. The armour she’d been holding up for hours finally gave way.</p><p>“Thank you,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Don’t thank me. Just… breathe, okay?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, and Rio didn’t move her hand away.</p><p>The hours blurred into one another, the soft light shifting from grey to gold across the hospital roomfloor.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t moved much. She sat where she’d been all night, one hand wrapped around a lukewarm cup of coffee, the other occasionally checking the pulse at Lilia’s wrist just to feel its reassuring beat beneath her fingers.</p><p>Rio was still beside her, shoulders slouched with exhaustion.</p><p>It had been hours since anyone had spoken. Words felt unnecessary.</p><p>Eventually, Rio’s radio crackled faintly, a low murmur of voices, the fire station calling her name. She sighed, rubbing a hand over her face.</p><p>“I have to check in,” she said softly. “We’ve got inspection rounds this morning.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart sank a little, though she kept her tone even. “Of course. Duty calls.”</p><p>Rio stood, stretching the stiffness from her shoulders. “I’ll come back as soon as I can.”</p><p>“You don’t have to—”</p><p>Rio cut her off gently, a small smile tugging at her lips. “I want to.”</p><p>Agatha looked up at the softness in her expression, the quiet certainty and managed a faint nod. “All right.”</p><p>Rio hesitated a moment longer, then reached down and brushed her thumb against the back of Agatha’s hand. “Get some rest, Doctor.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched, almost a smile. “I’ll try.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “You’ll do.” She said, mimicking Agatha’s authoritative tone.</p><p>And then she was gone the door closing softly behind her, leaving Agatha in the hum of monitors and sunlight.</p><p>Hours passed.</p><p>Nurses came and went.</p><p>Jen stopped by with fresh coffee and Wanda brought a blanket, both gently telling her to take a break. She didn’t.</p><p>She couldn’t.</p><p>Then, sometime in the late afternoon, the hand beneath hers twitched.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up. “Lilia?”</p><p>Her eyelids fluttered — slow, groggy, but there. A long, shaky breath followed.</p><p>“Agatha?” Lilia rasped.</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha’s voice broke on the word. “Yes, I’m here.”</p><p>Lilia blinked up at her, disoriented for a moment before her gaze softened. “You look like hell, my girl.”</p><p>Agatha laughed a wet, trembling sound . “You terrified me.”</p><p>Lilia gave a faint smile. “Good. Keeps you humble.”</p><p>Tears spilled down Agatha’s cheeks before she could stop them. “Don’t ever do that again.”</p><p>“I’ll try,” Lilia murmured. “But I make no promises.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled a laugh that turned into a sob. “I thought—”</p><p>“You and me both.” Lilia said gently, reaching for her hand. “But I’m still here.”</p><p>Agatha gripped her fingers tight.</p><p>Lilia’s fingers twitched weakly in Agatha’s grasp, her eyelids fluttering closed for a beat.</p><p>“Lilia?” Agatha leaned closer, her voice trembling. “Do you need anything? Water, maybe—”</p><p>Lilia gave a faint, dry laugh that rasped against her throat. “I need you to stop fussing and sit still for once.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, relief breaking through the tightness in her chest. “Goddess, you scared me.”</p><p>“Good,” Lilia murmured, a ghost of a smile curving her lips. “Maybe now you know how I feel most days, watching you run yourself into the ground. Just stay still with me.”</p><p>So Agatha stayed. For a while, neither of them spoke. The only sound was the faint hum of the monitors, the steady rhythm that reminded her that Lilia was still here. <br/>Still breathing. <br/>Still fighting.</p><p>Finally, Lilia spoke again, her voice low but clear. “Do you remember when you first came to live with me?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the sudden turn. “Of course I do.”</p><p>“You were twelve.” Lilia said softly. “You barely spoke a word to me for the first month. Wouldn’t eat, wouldn’t sleep, sat by the window like you were waiting for someone who was never going to come.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. “You don’t have to—”</p><p>“I do,” Lilia said, squeezing her hand. “Because I remember the night that changed. I came downstairs, and you were in the kitchen, trying to boil water for tea. You looked at me like I might throw you out just for breathing too loud.”</p><p>Agatha let out a trembling laugh. “You told me I was boiling an almost empty pot.”</p><p>Lilia smiled faintly. “And you cried when I told you it was alright. That you could stay as long as you needed.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat burned. “I remember.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice softened, each word deliberate.</p><p>“You were so closed off, Agatha. So afraid to let anyone in. I thought, back then, that you might never trust anyone enough to let them see who you really are. But slowly, you did. You let me in. You started to laugh again. And I saw you for who you are... a beautiful soul who’s just been hurt too many times.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, tears gathering in her eyes.</p><p>“And when you lost Nicky,” Lilia went on gently, “I saw that same wall go back up. You stopped letting yourself feel. Because feeling meant loss. And loss meant pain.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, her hand tightening around Lilia’s. “You don’t understand—”</p><p>“Oh, but I do,” Lilia whispered.</p><p>“Because I’ve watched you. You come to this hospital every day and pour your heart into saving people, but you’ve stopped letting anyone save you.”</p><p>Agatha looked down, her voice barely audible. “It’s easier that way.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Lilia said, her eyes glinting with something fierce and loving. “But easier isn’t living. You think closing your heart will keep it from breaking, but all it does is stop it from beating.”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t answer. The tears she’d been holding back finally spilled over, silent and hot.<br/>Lilia reached up, brushing a trembling hand against her cheek. “You’ve found someone who makes that heart remember how to beat again, haven’t you?”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Lilia smiled faintly. “You don’t have to say it, my girl. I see it. The way you look at her... the way you try <em>not</em> to. Full of love you’re too scared to name.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice cracked. “I can’t lose someone again, Lils.”</p><p>Lilia’s gaze softened, but her tone was steady. “Maybe you won’t. Maybe you will. But if you don’t take the chance, you’ll lose yourself instead.”</p><p>Agatha lowered her head, shoulders shaking with quiet, exhausted sobs.</p><p>Lilia squeezed her hand one last time before letting her eyes drift shut again. “You’ve spent your whole life running from pain, Agatha. Maybe it’s time to run toward something instead.”</p><p>Agatha sat there long after, her tears drying against the back of Lilia’s hand, her chest aching with everything she hadn’t said and everything Lilia already knew.</p><p> </p><p><br/>For a long time after Lilia drifted back to sleep, Agatha sat in silence, her hand still clasped around Lilia’s, the rhythmic beep of the monitor echoing through the dim room.<br/> Each pulse of the green line on the screen felt like a heartbeat tethering her to something she hadn’t dared to feel in years.<br/> Each flicker whispered the same thing over and over.</p><p><em>You’re still here</em>.</p><p>Lilia’s words had lodged themselves deep inside her, stubborn and inescapable.</p><p><em>You’ve stopped letting anyone save you.</em></p><p><br/><em> You think closing your heart keeps you safe, but all it’s done is stop you from living.</em></p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched as she stared at the rise and fall of Lilia’s chest.<br/> She hated how right she was.<br/> She hated that the truth burned worse than the fear.</p><p>She had built her life out of walls — sterile, precise, unbreachable.<br/> Walls that had kept her from drowning after Nicky.<br/> Walls that let her function, work, exist.<br/> But lately, those same walls had started to crack, and she knew exactly who had done it.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>She didn’t want to think about her, but the thought came anyway, uninvited and unrelenting.</p><p><br/> Rio’s voice in her ear that day she’d panicked, calm and grounding.</p><p><br/> The warmth of her hands.</p><p><br/> The sound of her laugh.</p><p><br/> The way she’d said her name like it was something soft and worth keeping.</p><p><em>You can’t afford to feel</em>, the old voice in her head warned.<br/><em> Feeling is how you break.</em></p><p>But another voice, quieter — Lilia’s — whispered, <strong><em>Maybe breaking is how you heal</em></strong>.</p><p>Agatha pressed a trembling hand to her mouth, the emotion rising like a tide she couldn’t stop.</p><p>“God, Lils,” she murmured, voice hoarse. “You always know where to hit.”</p><p>Her eyes stung, but she didn’t wipe the tears away. She let them fall, hot and unguarded, landing on Lilia’s hand.</p><p> For the first time, she didn’t swallow the ache back down. She let herself feel it... all of it.<br/> </p><p>The grief, the longing, the quiet, terrified hope.</p><p>And underneath all of that, the truth she’d been running from for weeks.</p><p>She wanted Rio.</p><p><br/> Not in passing.</p><p>Not in curiosity.</p><p><br/> She wanted her with the kind of clarity that made her heart ache — wanted to reach out and hold on to something real before life took it away again.</p><p>The sound of the door opening broke through the quiet.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said softly from the doorway, her voice careful, respectful. “How is she?”</p><p>Agatha turned.</p><p>Rio stood bathed in the amber wash of the hallway light, her dark hair loose, curling slightly at the ends, her uniform traded for a plain grey T-shirt and jeans. The faint sheen of the day’s heat clung to her skin, and her eyes — those warm, steady eyes — found Agatha’s immediately.</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest tightened and then unfurled all at once.</p><p>“She woke up, lectured me,” she managed. “Now shes resting.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders eased. “Good. That’s good.” She stepped inside, voice softening. “You should sit down. You look exhausted. Have you—”</p><p>But the rest never came.</p><p>Because something in Agatha snapped or maybe it mended. </p><p>She couldn’t tell the difference anymore. </p><p><br/>All she knew was that the space between them suddenly felt unbearable.</p><p>Before she could think, she was moving. Two steps, quick, certain - and then she was standing in front of Rio, her pulse pounding so loud it drowned out the world.</p><p>For half a second, Rio looked startled, her eyes wide, lips parting to speak but Agatha didn’t let her.<br/> Didn’t let logic win this time.<br/> Didn’t let fear decide for her.</p><p> </p><p>She kissed her.</p><p> </p><p>It was desperate at first, a collision of breath and heartbeat, of too many unspoken things finally finding their escape. </p><p>But then it softened, deepened, turned into something tender and trembling.<br/> Rio’s hand came up to cradle the back of her neck, steady, grounding, while Agatha’s fingers curled into the fabric of her shirt, afraid that if she let go, the world might vanish again.</p><p>When they finally broke apart, they were both breathing hard.</p><p><br/> The world felt different, more sharp, clearer and so fucking alive.</p><p>Rio’s eyes searched hers, dazed and bright. “Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her voice raw. “I’ve spent so long being afraid to want anything.”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak. She just smiled, small, trembling, radiantt and leaned her forehead against Agatha’s.</p><p>For a long, fragile heartbeat, there was only silence. </p><p>The hum of the machines, the whisper of their breath.</p><p>Then the monitor beside them let out a sharp <em>beep-beep-beep</em>, the rhythm suddenly quickening.</p><p>Agatha froze. Rio blinked, startled.</p><p>And from the bed behind them came a faint, raspy voice. </p><p>“About damn time.”</p><p>Agatha’s head dropped against Rio’s shoulder with a low, incredulous laugh. </p><p>“Of course,” she muttered, not turning around. “Lilia, if you don’t calm down, you’ll set your heart off again.”</p><p>There was a soft chuckle from the bed. </p><p>“Sweetheart, after that show, it’s a miracle it’s still beating at all.”</p><p>Rio went crimson, stepping back just slightly, while Agatha groaned under her breath — half mortified, half amused.</p><p>She finally turned, one hand still brushing Rio’s arm. </p><p>“You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>Lilia smiled weakly from her pillow, eyes gleaming. “And you’re <em>finally</em> human. Don’t you dare ruin it by pretending otherwise.”</p><p>The knock came without warning. Three sharp raps — the kind that made Agatha instinctively step back, guilt flashing across her face before the door even opened.</p><p>“Permission to enter?” came Chief Romanoff’s voice.</p><p>Agatha froze, realising too late that she was still holding onto Rio’s arm. Her fingers were wrapped just below her elbow, the faint heat of Rio’s skin still lingering against her palm. She dropped it as though it burned, straightened her coat, and tried to school her face into neutrality.</p><p>“Chief,” she said, voice an octave too high. She cleared her throat and tried again. “Chief Romanoff. I didn’t hear you knock.”</p><p>“Clearly,” Natasha said smoothly, stepping inside with that deceptively calm stride. </p><p>Her gaze swept over the room, first to Lilia, propped up in bed with a smirk that could melt concrete, then to Agatha, pink-cheeked and fidgeting, and finally to Rio, whose expression sat somewhere between guilty and adorably clueless.</p><p>Natasha raised a brow. “Am I interrupting something?”</p><p>Lilia gave a slow, feline smile. “Just some oral examinations.”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped toward her. “Lilia!”</p><p>“What?” Lilia’s tone was all innocence. “I almost died, sweetheart. I’m allowed to enjoy a little scandal on my recovery day.”</p><p>Rio coughed into her hand, her ears turning a deeper shade of red. “Uh—she was just—”</p><p>“Checking your pulse, perhaps?” Lilia supplied, grinning wickedly. “Don’t worry, dear, I approve.”</p><p>Agatha looked mortified. “Lilia, for the love of god—”</p><p>“Relax,” Natasha said dryly, cutting in before Agatha could combust. “I’ve walked into worse scenes. At least everyone’s fully clothed.”</p><p>Rio made a small, strangled sound that might have been a laugh. Agatha wanted the floor to open up and swallow her whole.</p><p>“Vitals are stable,” Natasha continued, checking the monitor like nothing was out of the ordinary. </p><p>“Excellent recovery, Lilia. Though perhaps you should let Dr Harkness breathe before giving her a heart attack.”</p><p>“I was just giving her incentive,” Lilia said sweetly. “She looks better flustered. Don’t you think, Rio?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “I—uh—sure?”</p><p>“Wonderful,” Lilia sighed, sinking back against her pillow, looking far too pleased with herself. “Now someone take her home before she finds another excuse to hover. She hasn’t slept in thirty hours.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha muttered, still avoiding Rio’s eyes.</p><p>Rio’s voice was gentle. “I can drive her. Make sure she gets home.”</p><p>“Perfect!” Lilia declared instantly. “She accepts.”</p><p>“I haven’t said—” Agatha began, but Lilia wagged a finger.</p><p>“Ah-ah. Don’t ruin the moment, my girl. Take the ride. Who knows, maybe you’ll even—relax.”</p><p>The last word dripped with implication.</p><p>Agatha groaned into her hand. “Oh my...You are <em>insufferable</em>.”</p><p>“I’m alive,” Lilia countered, her grin pure mischief. “I intend to enjoy it. You should try that sometime.”</p><p>Agatha bent down, pressing a kiss to Lilia’s forehead to hide her smile. “Behave.”</p><p>“After the show you two just put on?” Lilia quipped, eyes glinting. “Not likely.”</p><p>Rio’s face went crimson. “I—I’ll just wait outside.”</p><p>“Good idea,” Natasha murmured.</p><p>Once Rio slipped out, Agatha exhaled, pinching the bridge of her nose. “I swear you do this on purpose.”</p><p>“Oh, absolutely,” Lilia said serenely.</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, grabbed her bag, and turned toward the door. “Don’t be distracting the nurses while I’m gone.”</p><p>Lilia winked. “Go get your firefighter, sweetheart.”</p><p>The door closed behind Agatha just as Natasha turned to Lilia, one brow raised. “What exactly did I just walk into?”</p><p>Lilia smiled, utterly unapologetic. “A long time coming.”</p><p>Natasha snorted softly, shaking her head. “I’m not even going to ask.”</p><p>From the hallway came Agatha’s muffled voice, equal parts exasperated and flustered. “I can still fucking hear you!”</p><p>Lilia chuckled, leaning back against the pillow with a satisfied sigh. “Good,” she murmured. “Maybe this time she’ll finally listen.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The morning light spilled softly through the hospital corridors, brushing everything in a pale, forgiving gold. The ER was just beginning to hum with life with the shuffling of nurses changing shifts, the low murmur of voices, the faint scent of coffee and antiseptic.</p><p>Agatha moved through it all with quiet purpose, a small paper bag in hand. She greeted no one, but there was a subtle difference in her stride and a looseness to her shoulders, a softness in the set of her mouth that hadn’t been there before.</p><p>When she reached Lilia’s room, she paused briefly at the door, composed herself, and stepped inside.</p><p>Lilia was awake, propped up against her pillows, the morning news murmuring faintly on the television. </p><p>She turned her head immediately, eyes bright and far too knowing. “Well, look at you,” she said, voice still rough from sleep but rich with amusement. “You’re practically glowing.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow as she set the paper bag down on the tray table. “Good morning to you too.”</p><p>“Mmm,” Lilia hummed, eyeing her like a cat eyeing a secret. “Brought offerings, did you?”</p><p>“An almond croissant,” Agatha said, sitting at her bedside. “From that bakery you like. I thought you might appreciate something other than hospital oatmeal.”</p><p>“Oh, I appreciate it,” Lilia said, tearing off a small piece. “But I’m more interested in the reason behind the good mood that delivered it.”</p><p>Agatha blinked innocently. “Reason?”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “You can drop the act, sweetheart. I was there when you practically tackled that poor girl with your lips.”</p><p>Agatha froze mid–sip of coffee, colour creeping high on her cheeks. “Lilia.”</p><p>“What? I might’ve been half-dead, but my eyesight works just fine,” Lilia said, biting into her croissant.<br/>
 “And for the record, that was the best entertainment I’ve had in months.”</p><p>Agatha pinched the bridge of her nose, exhaling slowly. “You’re insufferable.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Lilia said through a smile. “But I’m right.” She nodded toward Agatha’s flushed face. “I haven’t seen that look on you in years. You used to walk around like the world owed you grief. Now look at you — soft around the edges. Practically human.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look. “I am human.”</p><p>“Barely,” Lilia teased. Then her tone gentled. “Don’t go hiding behind that mask again. You’ve been keeping people out so long you’ve forgotten what it’s like to let someone in.”</p><p>Agatha busied herself straightening Lilia’s blankets, trying for composure. “You make it sound so simple.”</p><p>“It’s not,” Lilia said softly. “But neither is living alone in your own head. You’ve done that long enough, my girl. And if Rio makes you smile like this…” She gestured toward Agatha’s faintly blushing face. “Then maybe it’s time you stop pretending you don’t care.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at the floor, throat tightening despite herself. “I don’t know how to do this anymore, Lils. Not after…”</p><p>“Nicky?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, barely.</p><p>Lilia reached out, taking her hand with a slow squeeze. “Then let her teach you. You don’t need to have all the answers. You just need to let yourself feel.”</p><p>For a long moment, the only sound in the room was the steady beep of the monitor and the distant murmur of morning rounds beginning outside.</p><p>Then Agatha exhaled, the smallest smile touching her lips. “Eat your croissant before it goes stale,” she said softly.</p><p>Lilia grinned. “Deflection noted. But it won’t save you. I expect details later.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, standing to go. “You’re nosey.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Lilia said, leaning back with a satisfied hum. “But you, my dear, are finally happy again.”</p><p>Agatha stopped at the doorway, fighting the smile tugging at her lips but ultimately lost. “Rest, Lils. I’ll be back to check on you before lunch.”</p><p>Her morning began like every other, rounds, charts, and the low hum of hospital machinery filling the air. </p><p>Everything should have felt familiar. </p><p>Routine. </p><p>Controlled.</p><p>But something was different.</p><p>Her steps were lighter. Her shoulders less tense. There was a small, almost imperceptible curve to her mouth that she wasn’t aware of until people began to notice.</p><p>The first was Billy. He caught up with her outside a patient’s room, walking briskly to match her pace.</p><p>“Morning, Doctor Harkness,” he said with too much cheer. “You seem… different today.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up from the chart she was signing. “Different how?”</p><p>Billy hesitated, suddenly less confident. “I don’t know. Happier? You’re walking like someone who got at least six hours of sleep. Maybe even seven.”</p><p>Her pen stilled mid-line. Slowly, she raised her gaze to him, one brow arching in warning. “Are you implying I looked miserable before?”</p><p>Billy blanched. “No, no! You just seem… less terrifying this morning?”</p><p>She regarded him for a long, silent moment before replying in her calmest voice. “Go recheck your notes, Teen. Before I find you scut work.”</p><p>He left in a hurry.</p><p>For a while, things went smoothly again. Agatha moved through the ER with her usual precision, determined to ignore the faint ripple of warmth that had followed her since the night before. </p><p>But it was there, stubborn and quiet. Every time she caught her reflection in the glass of the nurses’ station, she looked… softer. And it unsettled her more than she cared to admit.</p><p>Wanda found her next, leaning over the counter with a patient chart in hand. “You’re humming,” she said casually.</p><p>Agatha frowned. “I’m what?”</p><p>“Humming,” Wanda repeated, pretending to study her clipboard. “In the corridor. Teen swears he heard it too.”</p><p>“That’s ridiculous,” Agatha said, her tone flat. “I don’t hum.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, not looking up. “You also don’t smile at lab results, but you did that five minutes ago.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “You should really find a hobby, Maximoff. Something that doesn’t involve stalking your colleagues.”</p><p>“I’ll get right on that,” Wanda said, clearly amused, before disappearing down the hall.</p><p>Agatha took a slow breath, her jaw tightening. It was fine. Everything was fine. People were simply bored. That was all.</p><p>Until Jen appeared.</p><p>She arrived at the nurses’ station with a coffee in hand and that infuriating smirk that always meant trouble. “You know,” she began conversationally, “word around the ER is that Doctor Harkness has developed an actual mood. It’s throwing everyone off balance.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look up. “Jen.”</p><p>“Maybe it’s the weather,” Jen continued, feigning thoughtfulness. “Or maybe it’s got something to do with a certain firefighter who’s been mentioned around here lately.”</p><p>Agatha’s grip on her pen tightened. “Jen,” she said again, more sharply this time.</p><p>Jen only grinned wider. “What? I’m just saying—if you’ve finally found someone capable of making you smile, the rest of us owe them a thank-you gift.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her eyes, expression cool and perfectly measured. “If you don’t leave right now, I’ll have you reassigned to the overnight chart audit for the next week.”</p><p>Jen raised her hands in mock surrender, still grinning. “There’s the ice queen I know and fear.”</p><p>By the time she walked off, humming under her breath, Agatha could feel the last traces of her earlier lightness draining away. The lines of her face sharpened again; her tone turned crisp, clipped, untouchable.</p><p>She told herself it was better this way. Better to keep her guard up. Better to be the version of herself no one dared to pry into.</p><p>But as she moved on to her next patient, the faint memory of Rio’s smile flickered unbidden in her mind, softening her for just a heartbeat before she forced it down again.</p><p>By the time Agatha reached Lilia’s room again, her mood had curdled into irritation. The hospital was loud with its usual chaos—ringing phones, the squeak of gurney wheels, the relentless chatter of nurses. </p><p>She was halfway through composing a sharp note about a missed lab order when she looked up and froze.</p><p>Rio was there.</p><p>She stood at Lilia’s bedside, hair pulled into a tight low bun, the navy of her fire-crew shirt dark against her skin. Cargo pants, scuffed boots, sleeves rolled high enough to show the strong lines of her forearms. </p><p>There was a faint flush on her cheeks, a shy, uncertain grin playing at her mouth, the kind of expression that made something in Agatha’s chest lurch before she could stop it.</p><p>On the tray table sat a thermos and a small container, steam curling lazily upward.</p><p>Lilia was eating, looking far too pleased for someone in recovery. “You just missed your competition, Agatha,” she said. “Turns out my lunch today was made with actual care.”</p><p>Rio looked up quickly, the grin faltering for just a moment. “Hi,” she said, quieter now. “Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha’s heartbeat stumbled, but she recovered fast. “Rio.”</p><p>It was the first time they’d seen each other since last night—since their second kiss, since she’d agreed to the date Rio promised to plan. And now here she was, in her uniform, smeiling at her like she was the stars and the moon.</p><p>Agatha forced herself to move, to speak, to sound like herself. “You’re cooking now?”</p><p>Rio’s shy grin deepened a little, her fingers fidgeting with the thermos cap. </p><p>“Always have. My abuela taught me. She said if you love someone, you learn to feed them.” Her voice softened. “She passed a few years ago, but I still cook like she’s watching over my shoulder.”</p><p>Lilia smiled around her spoon. “Well, your abuela knew what she was doing. This might be the only real food I’ve had since I checked in.”</p><p>Agatha folded her arms, trying not to show how her chest ached at the gentleness in Rio’s voice. “You didn’t have to bring food.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “Lilia’s fed half the fire crew over the years. Figured it was time we returned the favour.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes flicked between them, full of quiet amusement. “And here I thought you were just being sweet on me. But it’s really you just wanted to see the pretty doctor.”</p><p>Agatha’s look could’ve sliced steel. “Lilia.”</p><p>“What? I’m just saying—you seem lighter this morning, that’s all. Like someone finally reminded you there’s life outside of this building.”</p><p>Rio ducked her head, smile flickering, colour rising in her cheeks. “Guess I picked a good day to stop by, then.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice softened before she could stop it. “You did.”</p><p>They held each other’s gaze a second too long, the rest of the world falling into hush. Then Agatha cleared her throat and turned brisk again. “Lilia’s recovering well. Try not to spoil her or she’ll start expecting room service.”</p><p>“I’ll keep it simple next time,” Rio said, still a little pink, but steadier now. “Just thought she could use something warm.”</p><p>“She appreciates it,” Agatha said, but it came out quieter than she meant.</p><p>Lilia set her spoon down with a clink. “And so do I. Now, unless you two plan on turning this room into a staring contest, I’m going to finish my lunch.”</p><p>Rio laughed quietly and wiped her palms on her jeans. “Alright. I’ll give you two some space.”</p><p>Agatha tried to answer with something polished and professional, but all that came out was a soft “Alright,” that sounded far too gentle.</p><p>Rio’s smile pulled at her mouth, small and a little uncertain, like she was trying not to show how nervous she felt. “I’ll come back later,” she said to Lilia. Her eyes drifted back to Agatha for a lingering moment. </p><p>“Try not to work too hard.”</p><p>The words were simple, but something in her tone caught Agatha completely off guard. It was kind. Warm. Almost hopeful, as if she wanted it to matter.</p><p>Rio left before either of them could make the moment any heavier. The faint scent of smoked paprika stayed behind, settling into the room like a reminder of her presence.</p><p>Agatha did not move for several seconds. Her pulse raced beneath her skin, sharp and insistent, as if the air still held Rio’s warmth.</p><p>Lilia watched her with a knowing smile. “She’s good for you,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, composing herself. “She’s… distracting.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “You say that like it’s a bad thing.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the smallest smile betrayed her. “Eat your soup, Lils.”</p><p>“Gladly,” Lilia said, dipping her spoon again. “Best thing I’ve eaten all week.”</p><p>Agatha turned to leave, pretending not to notice that her hands were still shaking.</p><p>Agatha made it halfway down the hall before she realised she wasn’t breathing properly. Her pulse was still pounding, echoing in her ears, and she hated that it felt… pleasant.</p><p>She told herself she was just tired. Just overstimulated. Just—<br/>
“Agatha!”<br/>
The sound of her name made her stop short.</p><p>Rio was jogging toward her from the elevator, the soft scuff of her boots against the linoleum somehow louder than the entire ward. She looked even more endearing up close—a stray strand of hair slipping free from her bun, an anxious little crease between her brows.</p><p>Agatha turned, hands folding neatly behind her back, every line of her posture composed even as her heartbeat stumbled. “Forget something?”</p><p>Rio came to a stop in front of her, clearly a little breathless but smiling anyway. “Yeah. I mean—yes. Kind of.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrow lifted. “Kind of?”</p><p>Rio rubbed the back of her neck, eyes darting briefly away before meeting hers again. “I, uh… realised I don’t actually have your number.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “My number.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said quickly, then tripped over her own explanation. “You know, for… professional reasons.”</p><p>“Professional?”</p><p>Rio nodded solemnly, though her ears were going pink. “Well, I’m planning this date and, uh—there are things I might need to consult you on. Allergies. Dress codes. Wine pairings. Things you consider fun and things you don’t.” She was rambling now… adorable.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, a laugh threatening to escape before she bit it back. “You want my number… so you can seek professional guidance in <em>dating</em> me?”</p><p>Rio winced, grinning helplessly. “When you say it like that, it sounds worse.”</p><p>“It sounds absurd,” Agatha said, though her voice had softened, her eyes glittering with barely contained amusement.</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio said, shifting her weight. “But if it gets me your number, I’ll take the hit.”</p><p>For a moment, Agatha could only stare at her—the boldness wrapped in awkwardness, the shy confidence that made her stomach twist in ways she didn’t care to name.</p><p>She exhaled through her nose, held out her slightly trembling hand. “Give me yours.”</p><p>Rio blinked, startled. “Oh. Uh—yeah, right.” She fumbled for her phone, nearly dropping it in the process, and Agatha bit back another smile as she took it, tapped in her number, and handed it back.</p><p>“There,” she said smoothly. “For emergencies. Medical or otherwise.”</p><p>Rio looked down at the screen, and her smile broke wide and honest before she could stop it. “You saved yourself in my contacts as <em>Doctor Harkness</em>?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow lifted. “I am a doctor.”</p><p>“Yeah, but you could’ve just put <em>Agatha</em>.”</p><p>“I could have,” she said evenly, folding her arms, “but I suspect you’d find a way to make that sound familiar.”</p><p>Rio grinned, eyes bright with mischief. “Maybe. But I think Agatha suits you better when I say it out loud.”</p><p>For a second, the air between them shifted—something quiet and charged humming beneath the fluorescent lights.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, turning half away to hide the smile threatening to surface. “You really don’t know when to stop, do you?”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, a little breathless. “Not really, no.”</p><p>Agatha reached out her hand again. “Give me the phone.”</p><p>Rio blinked, confused but obedient. “Uh… okay?”</p><p>Agatha took it, her expression unreadable as her thumb moved with deliberate precision. She changed the contact name, then handed the phone back without a word.</p><p>Rio looked down.<br/>
Agatha 💜</p><p>Rio’s smile grew, softer than before. “It’s perfect.”</p><p>Agatha looked anywhere but at her, pulse thrumming. “Try not to lose your phone,” she murmured. “I don’t intend to enter my number a third time.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Rio said, grin softening into something almost tender. “I’ll text you later.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, the faintest smile tugging at her lips. “I’ll look forward to the consultation.”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened, cheeks pink again. “You do that, <em>Doctor</em>.”</p><p>The elevator doors opened, and she stepped inside, giving a small, uncertain wave as they began to close. Agatha stood there for a moment longer than she should have, the corners of her mouth curving despite herself.</p><p>When she finally turned to go, her reflection in the glass caught her off guard—her expression softer than she’d seen in years.</p><p>She muttered under her breath, “Stop smiling like a fool,” and walked off with her heart thrumming like it had just remembered how to beat.</p><p><br/>
The hospital was silent in that particular way it only settled into after midnight. The lights were dim, the corridors muted, the air heavy with antiseptic and sleep. Most of the staff were gone. The few who remained moved in soft, tired rhythms.</p><p>Agatha sat alone in her office, the glow of her computer casting blue shadows across her desk. She had stayed late, catching up on the cases she had missed during the days she spent planted at Lilia’s bedside. </p><p>Her notes were half-finished, charts still open, the cursor blinking patiently on an untouched paragraph.<br/>
Her phone rested face down beside the keyboard.</p><p>She wasn’t waiting for anything.</p><p>She was working.</p><p>Still, when it buzzed, she reached for it before she could pretend otherwise.</p><p>A new message blinked onto the screen</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Hey. It’s Rio. Just making sure this is you and not… the morgue</em>.</p><p>Agatha smiled, unable to help herself. She leaned back in her chair, fingers tapping against the glass.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>You’d be surprised how often I get mistaken for a dead person.</em></p><p>There was a pause long enough for her to imagine Rio on the other end, staring at her phone, overthinking every word. Then—</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>So it is you.</em> <em>Sorry if it’s late. I just… didn’t want you to think I wasn’t going to text</em>.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I hadn’t given it much thought</em>.</p><p>That was a blatant lie.</p><p>Another pause.</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Okay, that’s fair. I’m just not great at this part.</em></p><p>Agatha tilted her head, intrigued despite herself.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Texting?</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Yeah. I get nervous. People usually say the wrong thing when they’re face to face. I say the wrong thing when there’s typing involved.</em></p><p>Agatha laughed quietly under her breath, the sound soft in the still room. She could see her — that shy grin, the way her shoulders probably hunched a little as she hit send.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Funny. Most people get bolder when there’s a screen between them. You seem to have the opposite problem.</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Yeah, I guess I used up all my bravery in person</em>.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I hadn’t noticed you were lacking any.</em></p><p>There was a delay this time — longer than before. Then, the reply came through</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Maybe it only works when you’re looking at me.</em></p><p>Agatha froze, caught entirely off guard by the honesty tucked inside the shyness. Then, slowly, she smiled.</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>Careful. That almost sounded like confidence.</em></p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Almost.</em></p><p>Agatha set the phone down, still smiling, a soft warmth blooming low in her chest. Rio was, to her continued astonishment, adorable.<br/>
 Not in the way most people tried to be. There was no pretence. Just quiet nerves, sincerity, and that same gentle humour that had slipped past Agatha’s defences since the very first night.</p><p>Her phone buzzed again.</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> I<em>’ll stop bothering you now. Just wanted to say… goodnight Agatha 🖤.</em></p><p>Agatha’s thumb hovered above the screen for a long moment. Then she typed,</p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>You’re not bothering me, Rio. Goodnight.</em></p><p>She locked her phone, leaned back, and stared at the ceiling with an expression she couldn’t quite contain — the faintest, secret smile curving her lips.</p><p>For someone who claimed to be bad at texting, Rio had managed to make silence feel like company.</p>

<p>The morning light was too bright for how little sleep she’d had.</p><p>Agatha sat in her usual corner of the hospital cafeteria, a cup of bitter coffee cooling between her hands, her tablet open to the day’s patient roster — unread. The hospital hummed softly around her, nurses in motion, the faint buzz of vending machines.</p><p>Her phone rested beside her tray. She wasn’t looking at it. Not really.</p><p>Except she was — every few minutes, catching her reflection in the dark screen, remembering the thread of shy, stumbling messages from the night before. Rio, with her awkward honesty and hesitant humour, who somehow made the quiet hours feel less empty.</p><p><em>I get nervous… I guess I used up all my bravery in person.</em><br/> Agatha’s lips curved before she could stop them. She took a sip of coffee to hide it.</p><p>“Okay,” said a voice, full of suspicion and caffeine deprivation. “What’s that smile?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t need to look up to know who it was. Jen slid into the seat across from her, balancing her own coffee and a bagel like a detective closing in on a confession.</p><p>“I wasn’t smiling,” Agatha said smoothly.</p><p>“You were absolutely smiling.” Jen tore off a piece of bagel, watching her with open amusement. “It’s kind of eerie, actually. I almost didn’t recognise you without the permanent scowl.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Do you ambush all your colleagues before rounds, or just me?”</p><p>“Only the ones with scandalous secrets,” Jen said, leaning forward conspiratorially. “Funny thing — Alice mentioned this morning that Rio’s been smiling nonstop since the other day. Wouldn’t happen to know anything about that, would you?”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up, faster than she meant. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Jen grinned. “Oh, come on. You and Firefighter Sunshine think you’re subtle? Alice lives with her. I’m fucking Alice. You do the math.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply through her nose. “I don’t appreciate being the subject of pillow talk.”</p><p>“Oh, please.” Jen waved a hand. “I’m not judging. I’m <em>thrilled</em>. Maybe you’ll finally get laid and do us all a favour.”</p><p>Agatha froze mid-sip of coffee. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Jen’s grin widened. “You know what I mean. You’ve been wound so tight these past few months, we were starting to worry you’d calcify.”</p><p>“Jen,” Agatha said, voice low and dangerous.</p><p>Jen only laughed, standing with her tray. “Relax. I’m just happy for you, Agatha. She seems good for you.”</p><p>When Jen walked away, Agatha stayed perfectly still. Her pulse, however, had betrayed her composure entirely.</p><p>The words <em>get laid</em> echoed far too vividly.<br/> She tried to shove them aside — to focus on anything else — but her mind betrayed her, unspooling an image she hadn’t meant to conjure.</p><p>Rio — the warmth of her hands, the solid strength of her forearms, the way her voice softened when she said Agatha’s name.<br/> The thought of that tenderness <em>directed at her</em> was dizzying. Unnerving. And, if she was honest, terrifyingly enticing.</p><p>She set her coffee down with deliberate care, aware that her fingers weren’t as steady as usual.<br/>Ridiculous. Absolutely ridiculous.</p><p>And yet—<br/>Her phone buzzed.<br/>She looked down.</p><p>Rio: <em>Morning, Agatha. I hope you didn’t stay at the hospital too late last night. I hear coffee helps. </em></p><p>Agatha felt a slow smile tugging at her mouth.</p><p>Agatha: <em>My patients will be relieved to know you are monitoring my caffeine intake with such dedication.</em></p><p>A pause. Long enough for Agatha to wonder if Rio had gotten shy again.</p><p>Then the messages came in a quick scatter.</p><p>Rio:<em> So… Alice saw me smiling at my phone again.</em><br/> Rio: <em>She asked if it was you.</em><br/> Rio: <em>And I said yes.</em></p><p>Another rushed string followed almost instantly<br/>Rio: <em>Shit. Is that okay?</em></p><p> Rio: <em>I didn’t think about it before I said it.</em></p><p> Rio: <em>I can tell her it was nothing if you want.</em></p><p> Rio:<em> Or that I was joking.</em></p><p> Rio: <em>If you’d rather keep this quiet…</em></p><p>Agatha let out a quiet breath, her chest warming at the anxious honesty in those messages.</p><p>She answered steadily.</p><p>Agatha: <em>Rio, we both know keeping anything a secret in this town is impossible.</em></p><p>Another message.</p><p>Agatha: <em>And I am not ashamed.</em></p><p>The pause afterward wasn’t nervous. It felt relieved.</p><p>Rio: <em>Okay.</em></p><p> Rio: <em>Good. I’m really glad.</em></p><p>Another bubble appeared, slower this time.</p><p>Rio:<em> So… about that date we never finished talking about…</em></p><p>A beat.</p><p>Rio: <em>What are your thoughts on carnival rides?</em></p><p>Agatha blinked at the screen.</p><p>Her first instinct was confusion, her second a pinch of something deeper, something she usually kept tucked behind layers of poise and sarcasm. Carnival rides. She had no frame of reference. None at all.<br/>Before she could type, a memory rose up sharp and clear, the kind that lived in the bones rather than the mind.</p><p>She was eight. Small, hopeful, the sleeves of her dress a little too long. She remembered the way the traveling carnival had lit up the edge of town like a constellation dropped too close to earth. She’d tugged on her mother’s sleeve, trying to be brave, trying not to sound too eager.</p><p><em>“Can we go? Just for a little while?”</em></p><p>Evanora had looked down at her with a slow, bored blink, a curl of amusement at the corner of her mouth—amusement that never meant anything kind.</p><p><em>“Really, Agatha, I do not have time to indulge childish fantasies. Those things are filthy. Loud. A waste of money. You wouldn’t enjoy it. You never enjoy anything.”</em></p><p>Then the drawling laugh. The dismissive wave of a hand that dismissed the child along with the question.<br/>And that had been that.</p><p>The closest Agatha had ever gotten to a carnival ride was watching the ferris wheel turn from her bedroom window, each spin a reminder that she was on the outside of something she wasn’t meant to touch.</p><p>She stared down at the phone in her hand now, realising with a strange, twisting feeling that she had grown into someone who never questioned that. Someone who never even tried.</p><p><em>God,</em> she thought, <em>Rio is going to think I’m a strange, fucking repressed Victorian relic who cannot experience fun.</em></p><p>She typed before she could overthink it.</p><p>Agatha: <em>I have no thoughts on carnival rides. I have never been on one.</em></p><p>Her thumb hovered over the send button for a moment, humiliation warming her cheeks in a way she hated before she pressed it anyway.</p><p>The typing bubble flickered, then steadied. Rio was thinking. Carefully. Then the message arrived.</p><p>Rio: <em>You’ve never been on one?</em><br/>Rio: <em>That just means I get to be the first person to take you. </em></p><p>Rio: <em>Honestly… that sounds kind of perfect.</em></p><p>Agatha felt a small jolt in her chest.</p><p>Another message appeared almost immediately, softer and impossibly sincere.</p><p>Rio:<em> I’d really like to fix that for you.</em></p><p> Rio:<em> I mean, only if you want me to, though.</em></p><p>The sincerity in it, light, hopeful, entirely without judgment or questions, hit her in a place she did not usually allow anyone near. She was seated in the quiet corner of the cafeteria, half-finished coffee cooling beside her. The hum of distant conversation filled the room, but her world narrowed to the glow of her phone.</p><p>A laugh slipped out of her. Soft. Completely genuine. Absolutely not something she ever allowed in public.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>Her eyes darted up, scanning the room. Two nurses discussing meal prep. A janitor pushing a cart. A resident she vaguely disliked inhaling soup like it was a competitive sport.</p><p>No one looked her way.</p><p>She exhaled, a hand briefly covering her mouth in disbelief at herself.</p><p>She typed back, attempting to regain some semblance of dignity.</p><p>Agatha: <em>You are very strange.</em><br/> Agatha: <em>And very persistent</em>.</p><p>Rio must have been holding her phone because the reply arrived instantly.</p><p>Rio:<em> I know. </em></p><p>Rio: <em>But you smiled, didn’t you?</em></p><p>Agatha stared at the message, her cheeks warming.</p><p>She had.</p><p> And she already knew Rio would take far too much joy in that fact.</p><p>Agatha tapped her fingers lightly against her cup, the warmth from Rio’s last message still lingering under her skin. She straightened a little, smoothing her expression before she typed back.</p><p>Agatha:<em> I smile at many things, Rio. You are simply very determined to take credit for all of them.</em><br/> Agatha: <em>Now tell me… when exactly do you plan on taking me on this carnival date?</em></p><p>The typing bubble appeared almost immediately, jittery and uncertain.</p><p>Rio:<em> Um… I was hoping you’d tell me when you’re free.</em><br/> Rio: <em>Because I… cant wait to see you again.</em></p><p>Agatha felt the edges of her mouth lift. Just slightly. She checked her schedule, though she already knew the answer.</p><p>Agatha: <em>Tomorrow night. Thursday.</em><br/> Agatha: <em>After that my shifts turn ridiculous, so it’s the only window I have.</em></p><p>A beat. Then several messages from Rio in quick succession-</p><p>Rio: <em>Tomorrow works. </em></p><p>Rio: <em>Actually that’s perfect.</em></p><p> Rio:<em> I can switch some things around.</em></p><p>Agatha’s brows lifted, a flicker of surprise warming her chest despite herself.</p><p>Agatha: <em>You would rearrange your schedule?</em></p><p>Rio: <em>Absolutely, Bucky owes me one.</em></p><p>Rio: <em>I’ll pick you up from Lilia’s at 7. </em></p><p>Rio:<em> And… dress warm.</em></p><p>Agatha stared at her phone for a moment, her pulse giving a quiet, traitorous skip at the certainty in that message. She softened her posture before she even realised she was doing it.</p><p>She typed back, teasing but gentle.</p><p>Agatha: <em>Should I be concerned about what “dress warm” implies?</em></p><p> Agatha:<em> Please reassure me you are not planning anything that involves frostbite.</em></p><p>Rio’s reply came quickly, and Agatha could almost picture her shy smile.</p><p>Rio: <em>No frostbite. </em></p><p>Rio: <em>I promise you’ll be warm. </em></p><p>Rio: <em>And safe. </em></p><p>Rio: <em>With me.</em></p><p>Agatha’s breath caught slightly.<br/> A softness bloomed low in her stomach before she forced her expression neutral again, glancing around the cafeteria to make sure no one was watching her soften like this.</p><p>Agatha: <em>Then I suppose… I will see you at 7.</em></p><p>Rio: <em>Can’t wait.</em></p><p>Agatha set her phone down, letting herself feel that warmth for one quiet moment before schooling her face back to calm.</p><p>Tomorrow suddenly could not come fast enough.</p><p>The rest of Agatha’s shift passed in a blur she tried not to blame entirely on the firefighter who had somehow asked her out on a date involving “dressing warm.”</p><p>After finishing her rounds, she stopped in to check on Lilia. She intended a brief update, nothing dramatic, merely an objective report that her evening plans had… changed.</p><p>She barely managed, “I’m seeing Rio tomorrow night,” before Lilia practically <em>launched</em> upright.</p><p>“A date!? Agatha, oh I’m so pleased.”</p><p>“You are recovering from a heart attacj,” Agatha scolded, placing a firm hand on her shoulder. “Lie back down before I sedate you.”</p><p>Lilia did not lie down. She squealed. At full volume.</p><p>Agatha had to press her down again, gently but with authority, muttering, “Absolutely unhinged,” under her breath.</p><p>Lilia only grinned up at her, glowing with delighted mischief.</p><p>When Agatha returned to the floor, her composure was back in place… mostly. Her tone was sharp enough to maintain order, yet softened enough that people noticed.</p><p>Wanda passed her in the hall, eyes narrowing with amused suspicion.</p><p>Jen caught her at the nurses’ station, looked her up and down, and simply said, “Huh.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “Explain that noise.”</p><p>Jen grinned. “Nope. I want to see how long you pretend today is normal.”</p><p>Agatha huffed and pivoted sharply, which only made Jen laugh harder.</p><p>And then, suddenly, it was the next day.</p><p>Her day off.</p><p>Which should have been peaceful, restorative, a much-needed reprieve.</p><p>Instead, Agatha woke at dawn, pulse already thrumming like she’d run a marathon in her sleep. She showered. Then showered again because the first one didn’t feel strategic enough. </p><p>She shaved her legs. </p><p>Then shaved them again, in case she had somehow grown new hair in the last ten minutes.</p><p>She stood in her bedroom changing outfits like she was preparing for a diplomatic summit rather than a date with a woman whose idea of a good time involved climbing burning buildings for fun.</p><p>By midmorning she was sitting on the edge of her bed in a robe, towel around her head, staring at her reflection as if it held answers to universal truths.</p><p>It did not.</p><p>Her stomach fluttered traitorously.</p><p>Tonight at seven, Rio— the firefighter who made her laugh and blush and feel young in ways she had forgotten—<br/>was coming to pick her up from Lilia’s.</p><p>Dress warm.</p><p>Agatha groaned into her hands.</p><p>“What am I doing?”</p><p>She was Dr Agatha Harkness.<br/> She had conquered medical school, residency, night shifts, grumpy patients, even Lilia on pain meds.<br/>She could survive one date.<br/>…probably.</p><p>She hoped.</p><p>For a long moment, she didn’t move.</p><p>The swelling excitement she’d woken with had thinned into something quieter. Rawer.</p><p>A knot of doubt tightened in her chest.</p><p><em>What on earth was Rio doing with someone like her?</em></p><p>Rio was… Rio.</p><p>Sweet in that earnest, uncalculated way Agatha had never learned to be.<br/> Caring to a fault.<br/> Emotionally stable in a way that made Agatha feel both envious and unworthy.<br/> Steady hands. Warm eyes. A softness that didn’t make her weak but made her magnetic.</p><p>And, of course, infuriatingly attractive.<br/> Agatha had tried not to dwell on that part, but her mind insisted on replaying the image of Rio leaning against the doorframe of Lilia’s room, cheeks flushed, smile shy, muscles shifting under her turnout shirt.</p><p>She scrubbed both hands over her face.</p><p><em>She’s a firefighter. She runs into burning buildings. She saves people. She is steady and warm and good.</em></p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p><em>And I am… damaged goods.</em></p><p>She didn’t use the phrase lightly. It was simply what she believed about herself in the moments when her armour slipped. Years of holding everything together by force. Years of being told she was cold, difficult, too much, not enough, impossible to love. Old scars carved into the quiet places of her.</p><p>Of course Rio wouldn’t see it yet.<br/> No one saw the fractures at first.</p><p>Agatha looked at her own reflection as if she could argue with her own face.</p><p><em>Why would she want someone whose idea of a childhood treat was watching other children ride a ferris wheel because her mother couldn’t be bothered?</em><br/><em>Why would she want someone who doesn’t know how to have fun without analyzing the risk factors?</em><br/><em>Why would she want someone who has spent their entire adult life convincing everyone she didn’t need anything from anyone?</em></p><p>Her breath came out thin.</p><p>It was ridiculous, she knew.<br/> She was a grown woman. A competent one. A desirable one, on her good days.</p><p>But Rio made her feel… exposed.</p><p>She pressed her fingertips to her temple, closing her eyes.</p><p><em>What if I ruin this? </em></p><p><em>What if she realizes I’m not soft enough?</em></p><p><em> What if she sees every broken corner I try so hard to hide?</em></p><p>Her chest tightened, just for a moment, fear curling under her ribs.</p><p>Then she inhaled, slow and deliberate, grounding herself the way she had learned over decades of surviving her own history.</p><p>She opened her eyes and met her reflection again.<br/>It didn’t magically fix the doubt.<br/>But it steadied her enough to remember one truth she couldn’t quite shake:<br/>Rio had asked her out anyway. Not someone else.<br/> Her.<br/>And Rio didn’t strike her as the type to chase things she didn’t actually want.</p><p>Rio had been the first person in years—maybe longer—to see past Agatha’s armour.</p><p>Not the polished version she presented at work. Not the sharp-tongued, controlled, unshakeable doctor. Not the woman who always had an answer ready and a wall firmly in place.</p><p>Rio had looked at her and seen something else entirely.</p><p>She had seen Agatha when she cracked.</p><p>Not just once.<br/> Not just in a moment of weakness that could be brushed off or excused.</p><p>Agatha remembered the night vividly—the night she’d stood in the on call room, the night the façade slipped. She had tried to hide it, jaw clenched, shoulders rigid, but Rio had stepped close, slow and careful, as if approaching a wounded animal.</p><p>Rio had simply said, “You don’t have to pretend with me.”</p><p>And Agatha, to her own shock, hadn’t snapped back.<br/> She hadn’t barked, deflected, or laughed coldly.<br/> She had just… breathed.<br/> And Rio had stayed. Quiet and steady. A presence rather than a demand.</p><p>Most people saw Agatha’s sharpness and assumed it was all she was.<br/> Rio saw the sharpness and understood there were soft parts underneath it, bruised and hidden but still there.</p><p>No one had done that for her in a long time.</p><p><em>What is it about you</em>, Agatha thought, <em>that makes me soften even when I don’t mean to?</em></p><p>Because around Rio she did soften.<br/> In these small, inconvenient ways she pretended not to notice.</p><p>Little smiles she didn’t restrain fast enough.<br/> Sarcasm delivered without real bite.<br/> A warmth in her voice she hadn’t used in years.<br/> A feeling—unfamiliar and terrifying—that she could actually be… happy.</p><p>Rio didn’t push her. She didn’t demand the softness. She simply created space where it felt safe to exist.</p><p>And somehow Agatha had stepped into that space without realising she’d moved.</p><p>The thought was dizzying.</p><p>She looked at herself in the mirror again, eyes softer than before, and whispered under her breath, almost as if she needed to hear it spoken aloud,</p><p>“She sees me.”</p><p>It wasn’t a declaration.</p><p> More a realisation.</p><p>A fragile one, but real.<br/>And tonight, for reasons she couldn’t fully articulate, she wanted to be seen.</p><p>Agatha inhaled slowly, grounding herself, and pushed away from the edge of the bed. </p><p>Enough spiralling. She had a date to get ready for.</p><p>She crossed to the wardrobe and opened it with purpose, even if her heart still fluttered. A glass of white wine steadied her hand—a crisp Sauvignon Blanc she poured into one of her nicer glasses. She took a slow sip, feeling the chill spread calm through her chest.</p><p>She surveyed her clothing with the intensity of someone awaiting judgment.</p><p>Nothing too formal. </p><p>Nothing too clinical.</p><p> Nothing that screamed <em>I am terrified please hold my hand</em>.</p><p>She reached for a soft knit cream sweater, the kind that skimmed her waist and hinted at shape without being overt. Feminine, warm, a little romantic. It felt… right.</p><p>Next, she chose a flowing navy skirt that brushed her calves, airy enough for summer but made of a heavier fabric that would hold warmth once the sun dipped. She paired it with low-heeled boots—practical, stylish, unlikely to get ruined by whatever mysterious “dress warm” activity Rio had planned.</p><p>She sipped her wine again, set the glass down, and moved to the mirror.</p><p>Her hair required coaxing. Not too much—just enough to look intentional. She let it fall in loose waves around her shoulders, tamed but still soft. She considered pinning it back, then decided she wanted it down. Rio liked it down.</p><p>Makeup came next. Nothing dramatic. A sweep of soft brown shadow, a hint of eyeliner to define her eyes, mascara to lift her lashes. A pink-nude lipstick that looked natural but not effortless—nothing about this was effortless.</p><p>She stepped back and looked at herself fully dressed.</p><p>Softer. Warm. Put-together. Human.</p><p>She felt her heartbeat pick up, but it wasn’t fear this time—it was anticipation. A rare, startling flicker of excitement.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, smoothing down her skirt.</p><p>She looked like someone going on a date.</p><p>And for the first time all day, she let herself believe she could enjoy it.</p><p><br/>Rio arrived exactly on time.</p><p>Agatha heard the low rumble of the engine before she saw anything, a deep, steady sound that vibrated faintly through the quiet street outside Lilia’s house. She stepped toward the front window, feeling suddenly, absurdly sixteen, and peeked out.</p><p>Rio’s black pickup was parked at the curb. Cleaned. Polished. She had definitely spent time on it.</p><p>Then Rio stepped out.</p><p>And Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>She had clearly made an effort. It was subtle, but unmistakable. Her dark jeans were new or nearly so, fitted in a way that left very little to Agatha’s imagination. She wore a charcoal Henley beneath a soft black fitted jacket. The look was more masculine than Agatha’s own elegance, but in a way that complimented rather than contrasted. Strong lines, soft expression.</p><p>Her hair was down, curling slightly just above her shoulders. Her boots were polished. Her posture—straight-backed but uncertain—made something in Agatha’s chest twist.</p><p>Then Rio pulled something from the passenger seat.</p><p>Flowers.</p><p>A small bouquet, wild-looking and mismatched in the most charming way: sunflowers, small white blossoms, eucalyptus. All tied with a piece of twine, clearly done by hand.</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p><em>Fuck, that’s adorable.</em></p><p>Rio approached the door with the careful steps of someone preparing to approach a wild creature—slow, respectful, nervous. She glanced at herself in the small window of the door, then immediately regretted it, brushing her palms on her thighs.</p><p>She knocked.</p><p>Agatha opened the door before she could talk herself out of it.</p><p>Rio froze.<br/> Her eyes widened, dragged slowly from Agatha’s boots to her skirt, to the soft cream sweater hugging her waist, and finally to her hair falling loose around her shoulders.</p><p>“Wow,” Rio breathed, the word slipping out before she could catch it. Her cheeks flushed. “I mean—sorry. I meant… you look…” She swallowed, then whispered the end. “Beautiful.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach fluttered, but she kept her voice controlled, warm but not too warm. “Thank you. And you look… presentable.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Presentable?”</p><p>A teasing smile pulled at Agatha’s lips as she rolled her eyes. “Oh come on, we both know you look hot.”</p><p>Rio laughed nervously, shifting the bouquet forward. “These are for you. I didn’t know what flowers you liked, so I just picked the ones I thought looked good.”</p><p>Agatha stared at them for half a heartbeat too long.</p><p>“They’re lovely,” she said softly. “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio let out a quiet breath, relief loosening her shoulders. “Good. I wasn’t sure if people still… did that.”</p><p>“Some do,” Agatha said, brushing her thumb lightly against a sunflower petal. “And it’s sweet.”</p><p>Rio beamed—shy but so open it made Agatha look down just to steady herself.</p><p>“Ready?” Rio asked, voice gentle, hopeful.</p><p>Agatha met her gaze. “Yes.”</p><p>And she was.<br/> More than she expected.</p><p><br/>Rio opened the truck door for her, stepping back like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow at the gesture. “Really?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, cheeks flushing a little. “My abuela raised me right.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the small flutter in her chest betrayed her. She climbed into the passenger seat, smoothing her skirt as Rio gently shut the door behind her.</p><p>Inside, the truck smelled faintly of pine and whatever soap Rio used. Clean. Warm. Comforting in a way Agatha wasn’t prepared for.</p><p>Rio got in on her side, buckled up, and shot her a shy smile before starting the engine. “Ready?”</p><p>Agatha pretended to study the dashboard. “We’ll see.”</p><p>Rio laughed, soft and warm, and pulled away from the curb.</p><p>The drive was surprisingly easy—comfortable in a way Agatha rarely felt with anyone.</p><p>They talked about work in that light, surface-level way where neither wanted to make the moment heavy.</p><p>Rio told her about the new recruit who accidentally sprayed the Bucky with a hose.</p><p>Agatha snorted. “And is he still alive?”</p><p>“Barely. Bucky is forgiving, but not that forgiving.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, amused. “Children shouldn’t be given hoses.”</p><p>“Try telling the captain that,” Rio said, grinning.</p><p>Their conversation drifted. No pressure. No awkward stops. Just simple, steady warmth.</p><p>Agatha found herself relaxing despite the fluttering anticipation still in her chest.</p><p>Then the truck slowed.</p><p>And she saw where they were.</p><p>The carnival gates were shut, the lights off, the entire place dark against the summer evening sky.</p><p>Agatha turned her head slowly toward Rio, suspicion sharp in her gaze.</p><p>“Rio,” she said carefully, “the carnival is closed.”</p><p>Rio made a thoughtful humming sound. “Observant.”</p><p>“Do you plan to trespass on our first date?” Agatha asked, arms folding.</p><p>Rio bit her lip, visibly fighting a smile. “Maybe.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to deliver a lecture she absolutely did not mean, but Rio winked at her.</p><p>A full, playful wink.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched—just slightly, but enough that she had to turn and pretend to inspect her handbag to hide the reaction.</p><p>Rio hopped out of the truck before Agatha could recover. She walked toward someone standing off to the side, and Agatha blinked, genuinely thrown.</p><p>An older woman in her late sixties, bright scarf, with a wad of keys stood waiting beside the gate.</p><p>Rio approached her warmly, shook her hand, spoke for a moment, then jogged back to the truck and opened Agatha’s door.</p><p>Agatha blinked up at her. “You know the carnival owner?”</p><p>Rio shrugged like it was nothing. “I helped her out a couple years ago.”</p><p>“Helped her how?” Agatha asked, sliding down from the seat.</p><p>“They had a fire and safety inspection deadline. Lots of upgrades needed. They were about to lose half their rides.” Rio guided her gently toward the entrance. “I pulled some strings. Got them an extension. Helped fix a few things myself. Saved them a pretty big fine.”</p><p>“And they are repaying you by… what? Giving us the run of the place?”</p><p>Rio smiled sheepishly. “Pretty much.”</p><p>The older woman unlocked the gates and gave Rio a fond pat on the cheek before slipping away with a conspiratorial grin.</p><p>As soon as Rio and Agatha stepped through the entrance, the carnival lights flickered on.</p><p>One strand. Then another.<br/> Then all at once.</p><p>Bright blues, golds, reds—glowing against the night.</p><p>Rides hummed to life.<br/> Music drifted through the air, soft and nostalgic.<br/> The entire carnival—empty, quiet, beautiful—stood waiting for them.</p><p>Agatha drew in a sharp, involuntary breath.</p><p>She hadn’t expected this.<br/> She couldn’t have imagined this.</p><p>Rio watched her carefully, nervously, hands shoved into the pockets of her jacket.</p><p>“I wanted you to see the joy of it,” she said quietly. “Even though it’s closed for the season. So I… called in that favour.”</p><p>Agatha turned to her, unable to speak for a moment.</p><p>Rio shifted, cheeks warming. “Is it okay? I mean, if it’s too much, we can just—”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, her voice soft, almost reverent.</p><p>“Rio… it’s…”<br/> She swallowed, emotion pressing unexpectedly at the back of her throat.<br/> “It’s perfect.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders relaxed, a shy grin tugging at her lips.</p><p>And in the glow of the empty carnival lights, Agatha felt something inside her—some long-locked door—quietly, cautiously, begin to open.</p><p><br/>Rio’s fingers brushed against hers once, tentative and unsure. When Agatha didn’t pull back, Rio gently laced their hands together without a word, her palm warm, steady, anchoring.</p><p>“Come on,” Rio said softly. “We’ll start easy.”</p><p>Agatha allowed herself to be guided, even though every instinct told her to maintain some distance, to keep herself composed. But Rio’s hand around hers felt… safe. Familiar, somehow. And she had no desire to let go.</p><p>The carnival stretched around them—empty, glowing, alive only for them. Music drifted in soft waves.</p><p>They stopped in front of the carousel.</p><p>The lights around the canopy twinkled in warm gold. The carved horses stood perfectly still, frozen mid-gallop, manes flying, eyes bright. The platform gleamed under the string lights, soft shadows dancing across the painted details.</p><p>A young man in a staff jacket stood beside it, giving them a polite smile. Agatha realised he must be the on-duty operator tonight—assigned specifically to follow them from ride to ride.</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand. “I figured we should start with something low stakes.”</p><p>Agatha arched one brow. “Low stakes? We are mounting wooden animals on poles.”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Exactly.”</p><p>Agatha tried—truly tried—not to let the wonder show. But her eyes lifted on their own, tracing the ornate trim of the carousel, the delicate gold leaf, the soft glow reflecting off the mirrors. She felt something tug inside her chest—something achingly familiar.</p><p>She remembered being eight years old.<br/> Standing at the edge of a carnival fence, nose pressed between the bars.<br/> Watching the horses spin, lights blurring into ribbons.<br/> Wanting—desperately—to be part of that spinning world.<br/> And hearing her mother’s dismissive scoff behind her.<br/> Not tonight, Agatha. Don’t be ridiculous.</p><p>She swallowed hard, pushing the memory back.</p><p>Rio’s voice cut through the ache, warm and hopeful. “Which one do you want to ride?”</p><p>Agatha lifted her chin with practiced poise. “I was unaware there were rules to selecting a plastic horse.”</p><p>Rio laughed. “They’re wooden.”</p><p>“Even worse.”</p><p>“Pick one anyway.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze betrayed her, drifting toward a pale grey horse with a sweeping silver mane and carved roses on its saddle. She looked away quickly, unwilling to let Rio see how much she loved it.</p><p>Rio followed her line of sight instantly. “That one?”</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat. “I suppose it is… aesthetically acceptable.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened—so gentle, so unbearably understanding that Agatha looked down at the ground to steady herself.</p><p>The attendant stepped up and nodded. “Ready when you are.”</p><p>Rio guided her onto the platform, hand still holding hers, warm and reassuring.</p><p>For one small, impossible moment, Agatha felt like that little girl again—standing outside the fence—only this time, someone had opened the gate and taken her hand, walking her in.</p><p>The carousel began to turn with a soft mechanical sigh, lights gliding across Agatha’s face in warm strokes of gold and rose. The music chimed—a lilting, old-fashioned tune—and for a moment she forgot to breathe.</p><p>Her chosen horse rose gently beneath her, the movement smooth and steady. She kept one hand lightly on the pole, posture composed, but inside her chest something fizzed and fluttered like champagne.</p><p>Giddy.<br/> That was the word.<br/> Giddy and—heaven help her—magical.</p><p>She tried not to show it. She tried very hard.</p><p>But then she glanced sideways.</p><p>Rio sat astride the horse next to her—feet planted, back straight, clearly aware of how ridiculous she looked but trying anyway for Agatha’s sake. A slightly crooked smile tugged at her mouth as she kept sneaking looks at Agatha, checking to see if she was enjoying it.</p><p>The sight made something warm bloom beneath Agatha’s ribs.</p><p>She looked away quickly, pretending to examine the lights instead of staring at Rio like a lovesick idiot.<br/>The carousel picked up speed, just enough to send a soft breeze lifting the ends of Agatha’s hair. She felt lighter than she had in years—untethered, almost.</p><p>Rio’s voice cut softly through the music.<br/> “Doing okay?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t trust her voice at first. When she finally turned her head, the lights reflected in her eyes. <br/>Rio’s gaze caught on the expression she hadn’t meant to reveal—part wonder, part disbelief, entirely vulnerable.</p><p>Her pulse hiccuped.</p><p>“I am…” Agatha cleared her throat, smoothing her skirt needlessly. “…sufficiently stable.”</p><p>Rio’s slow smile told her she wasn’t fooling anyone.</p><p>“Stable,” Rio repeated. “Right.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a tiny glare meant to be intimidating.</p><p>It only made Rio grin wider.</p><p>The carousel rose and dipped, rose and dipped, each movement loosening another thread of tension from Agatha’s spine. The breeze smelled of popcorn and cotton candy even though no stands were open. Lights streaked past in soft arcs. For a moment, she felt as if the whole world had tilted into something quieter, gentler.</p><p>She let her gaze slide back to Rio, unable to help herself.</p><p>Rio caught her this time.</p><p>Their eyes held.</p><p>Something tender flickered between them—shy, warm, so patient it made Agatha’s breath falter.</p><p>She looked away again, lips curving despite her best efforts.</p><p>When the ride slowed, the music fading into a soft echo, Agatha’s heart sank a fraction. She wasn’t ready for it to end.</p><p>Rio stepped off her horse first, then offered her hand—steady and warm—helping her down with a care that made Agatha’s stomach somersault.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asked again, voice low.</p><p>Agatha nodded, not trusting herself to speak.</p><p>Because she felt something she hadn’t felt in a long, long time.<br/>Magic. </p><p>Simple, innocent, foolish magic.<br/>And it was all because of the woman beside her.</p><p><br/>Rio led her deeper into the carnival, still hand-in-hand, and Agatha allowed it—partly because she didn’t want to pull away, partly because her legs felt suspiciously unsteady after the carousel.</p><p>Lights blinked along the empty midway, flickering on in welcoming patterns as if responding to their presence. The music softened to a hum.</p><p>Rio stopped in front of a row of darkened stalls.<br/> A moment later, the same attendant from the carousel hurried over, switched on a panel, and the game lit up: a classic ring-toss booth, targets gleaming under the fairy lights.</p><p>Rio rubbed the back of her neck.<br/> “Thought maybe we could try to win something.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “Aren’t these rigged?”</p><p>Rio grinned. “Probably. But the owner promised to, uh… relax the rules for us.”</p><p>Agatha looked at the rings, unimpressed. “How generous.”</p><p>Rio took a ring, squared her stance, and threw.</p><p>It missed by an inch.</p><p>She tried again—closer, but still not quite.</p><p>The fourth ring landed on the edge, wobbled tantalisingly, then fell off.</p><p>Rio winced. “Okay, that one was just rude.”</p><p>Agatha hummed thoughtfully. “Would you like me to show you how it’s done?”</p><p>Rio turned, eyes gleaming with a mix of hope and challenge. “Please. Enlighten me.”</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, rolling the ring between her fingers. She tested the weight, the balance—her surgeon’s brain already calculating distance, trajectory, force. Years of precision work kicked in like second nature.</p><p>She tossed.</p><p>The ring arced cleanly through the air and landed with a satisfying clink around the centre peg.</p><p>Rio blinked. “…Are you kidding me?”</p><p>Agatha allowed herself a graceful smile. “I am a surgeon, Rio. My hand–eye coordination is impeccable.”</p><p>Rio looked between Agatha and the perfectly landed ring, jaw slack. “Okay, but that was so fucking hot.”</p><p>Agatha felt her cheeks warm—and refused to acknowledge it.<br/> She reached for another ring, handing it to Rio.</p><p>“Here,” she said. “Try again. Use a little less power. You are throwing like you’re trying to breach a burning building.”</p><p>Rio laughed, taking the ring from her fingers. Her hand lingered, just a second longer than necessary.</p><p>“Maybe you should guide me,” Rio said softly.<br/>Agatha’s breath caught.<br/>But before she could respond, the attendant called cheerfully, “That counted as a win! Pick your prize!”<br/>Rio snapped upright. “Oh—right!”<br/>The man gestured toward a small wall of stuffed animals. Bright. Soft. Cheerful.</p><p>Rio’s eyes scanned the wall of prizes, lips pressed together in concentration as if she were choosing something of great importance.</p><p>Agatha watched her with crossed arms, pretending indifference—even as a small, ridiculous part of her wondered what Rio’s choice would say about her.</p><p>Finally, Rio pointed.<br/> “That one.”</p><p>The attendant reached up and pulled down a white floppy-eared bunny with soft brown spots, its ears tumbling over its face in a perpetually bashful look.</p><p>Rio took it gently, smoothing one of the ears with her thumb before turning and offering it to Agatha with both hands.</p><p>“This one feels right,” Rio said, cheeks colouring. “It’s soft. Kind. A little shy. But still really cute.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the bunny.</p><p>At Rio.</p><p>Back at the bunny.</p><p>“Cute?” she repeated, voice tight.</p><p>Rio swallowed, suddenly self-conscious. “In a refined way. A… very mature kind of cute.”</p><p>Agatha arched one brow. “You are digging yourself a hole.”</p><p>Rio’s grin turned shy again. “I know. But you deserve something nice.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught—just a tiny, betraying hitch she hoped Rio didn’t hear.<br/> She took the bunny, intending to hold it with professional detachment…</p><p>But the plush was incredibly soft.<br/> And the little brown spots were endearingly imperfect.<br/> And it practically melted against her palm.</p><p>Her fingers curled around it before she realised they had.</p><p>“It’s… acceptable,” she managed, voice softer than intended.</p><p>Rio’s smile bloomed—slow, warm, unmistakably pleased.<br/> “You’re welcome.”</p><p>Agatha hugged the bunny a bit closer to her chest, cursing herself internally when Rio’s smile deepened at the sight.</p><p>“Now,” Agatha said briskly, clearing her throat and straightening her posture, “what else does your carefully orchestrated carnival experience entail?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes sparkled, mischief tempered with tenderness.<br/> “Come on,” she said, reaching for her hand again.<br/> “You’re going to love this next part.”</p><p>Rio led her toward the far end of the carnival, where the lights glowed brighter and the machinery hummed with a deeper, more eager energy. As they rounded the corner, Agatha saw it.</p><p>A thrill ride.</p><p>The kind that spun, tilted, flipped, and sent riders careening upside down while shrieking in delight—or regret.</p><p>Agatha slowed her steps.</p><p>Rio noticed immediately.<br/> Of course she did.</p><p>She turned, hands in her jacket pockets, rocking on her heels with a careful sweetness Agatha was starting to recognise as her version of “checking in.”</p><p>“So…” Rio said slowly, glancing up at the looming metal structure, “this one’s… a bit more intense.”</p><p>Agatha raised her chin. “Define intense.”</p><p>“It flips you,” Rio admitted. “A couple times. Maybe more.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the ride.<br/> It stared back.</p><p>Rio’s voice softened. “We don’t have to do it. I mean that. Only if you want to.”</p><p>Agatha refused—absolutely refused—to be the woman who chickened out on a date. Not in front of a firefighter. Not in front of <em>this</em> firefighter.</p><p>“Of course I want to,” Agatha said smoothly.</p><p>Rio’s eyes twinkled. “You sure?”</p><p>“Quite sure.”</p><p>Inside, Agatha was screaming.</p><p>The attendant strapped them in, the harness clicking into place. Agatha’s heart hammered against her ribs like it was preparing its last rites. Rio sat beside her, close enough that their shoulders brushed, warm and grounding.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio murmured, leaning slightly toward her. “If it gets too much, just close your eyes. I’ll be right here.”</p><p>Agatha clenched the safety bar. “I am perfectly fine.”</p><p>The ride jerked forward.</p><p>She was not perfectly fine.</p><p>The first flip came without warning.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flew open, then shut again instantly as the world whipped upside down. She was determined not to scream but her entire soul launched upward as gravity flipped.</p><p>She managed a strained, “Oh my—!”</p><p>Rio’s delighted laugh filled the air, warm and bright.</p><p>The second flip hit.<br/>And Agatha screamed.<br/>Not in fear.<br/>In <em>joy.</em></p><p>A wild, unrestrained, furious explosion of exhilaration ripped out of her chest, surprising her more than the flipping itself.</p><p>Rio laughed harder, gripping the safety bar with one hand and reaching blindly for Agatha’s with the other. Their fingers brushed, then clasped.</p><p>The ride spun them again, faster, higher, the night lights blurring into ribbons of gold around them.<br/>Agatha’s laughter grew louder—full, breathless, utterly uncontained.<br/> Rio joined in, and the sound of them together echoed through the empty carnival, bright and wild and alive.</p><p>When the ride finally began to slow, Agatha was breathless, gripping Rio’s hand like her life depended on it, cheeks flushed, hair windswept.</p><p>Rio glanced over, eyes sparkling. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha took in a shaky breath.<br/> “I…” She swallowed, still panting softly.<br/> “I think I loved that.”</p><p>Rio beamed, pure sunshine.</p><p>As the ride slowed to a shuddering stop, Agatha’s breath was still caught somewhere between her ribs and her throat. Her hair was windswept, cheeks flushed, chest rising and falling in short bursts from laughing harder than she had in years.</p><p>The harness clicked open.</p><p>Rio hopped out first, a little unsteady herself, then immediately turned to offer her hand—warm, steady, grounding.</p><p>Agatha took it.</p><p>The moment her feet hit the ground, her legs wobbled.<br/> Rio’s did too.</p><p>They stumbled into each other, laughing—quiet at first, then breathlessly, helplessly, until the sound bounced down the empty midway like spilled starlight.</p><p>Agatha leaned into Rio without thinking, buoyed by adrenaline and joy and something softer, something she didn’t have the name or courage for.</p><p>Rio’s forehead dropped lightly against hers, both of them still catching their breath.<br/> Her smile was bright, unguarded, glowing in the carnival lights.</p><p>“That was intense,” Rio murmured, voice rough with laughter.</p><p>Agatha’s laugh softened into something quieter, almost disbelieving. “I feel… alive.”</p><p>Rio swallowed. “Good. You should always feel like that.”</p><p>The world narrowed.</p><p>Just them.<br/> The cool night air.<br/> The music drifting faintly.<br/> The lights flickering warm across Rio’s face.<br/> The smell of popcorn and machine oil and something sweet Agatha couldn’t name.</p><p>Rio’s gaze dropped to Agatha’s lips for the briefest second—so quick Agatha might have missed it if she hadn’t been watching her with impossible precision.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.<br/> Rio stepped closer.</p><p>“Can I—” Rio began, voice barely above a whisper.</p><p>Agatha didn’t let her finish.</p><p>She leaned in, closing the gap in one smooth, certain movement, her hand sliding up to Rio’s jaw as their lips met.</p><p>The kiss was soft at first—gentle, warm, a question and an answer all at once.<br/> Then Rio exhaled a tiny sound against her mouth, fingers curling into the fabric of Agatha’s sweater, and it deepened just enough to feel real.<br/> Present.<br/> Electric.</p><p>For a long moment, the world spun in a far better way than any ride could manage.</p><p>When they finally pulled apart, both breathless, Rio rested her forehead against Agatha’s again, cheeks flushed in the golden lights.</p><p>“Wow,” Rio murmured, voice slightly shaky. “That was… wow.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, trying to gather her pulse into something dignified.<br/> She failed spectacularly.</p><p>Rio bought them cotton candy from a booth the attendant hurriedly reopened, spinning the sugar into a soft pink cloud that glowed under the carnival lights. Agatha held it delicately between her fingers, eyeing the fluff with suspicion until Rio tore off a piece and pressed it to her lips.</p><p>“Just try it,” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha shot her a look… then took the bite.</p><p>It dissolved instantly on her tongue. Sweet. Weightless.<br/> She blinked, surprised. “IHow much sugar is <em>in</em> this?”</p><p>Rio laughed, handing her the rest, and Agatha pretended not to feel the warmth blooming in her chest at the sound.</p><p>They walked together, sharing bites of cotton candy, the white bunny plush tucked under Agatha’s arm, until the towering silhouette of the ferris wheel came into view.</p><p>Its lights flickered on—soft gold and blue, glowing against the night sky.</p><p>Rio looked at her, waiting for permission.<br/> Agatha answered with a small nod.</p><p>They climbed into the carriage, the metal creaking gently beneath them. Rio sat close—not touching, not pushing—but near enough that Agatha could feel her warmth.</p><p>As the wheel began its slow ascent, the carnival spread beneath them, lights stretching out like scattered stars. The night breeze lifted Agatha’s hair, brushing it softly against Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>For a moment, neither spoke.</p><p>Then Agatha inhaled, steady but quiet, and said in a voice that felt almost too fragile for her own ears-<br/>“I don’t remember the last time I felt this happy.”</p><p>Rio turned toward her, eyes softening. “Agatha…”</p><p>“I’m serious,” Agatha continued, gaze fixed on the glowing world below. “It feels… almost unreal.” Her voice softened more. “Thank you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio reached for her hand—not grabbing, not overwhelming—just offering.</p><p>Agatha placed her hand into Rio’s without hesitation.</p><p>As they rose higher, the wind colder, the lights brighter, Agatha felt her heart squeezing in a way that was both painful and beautiful.</p><p>She looked out over the carnival, over the sweeping view, and a memory flickered, sharp and familiar.</p><p>She was a child again, pressed against her bedroom window, chin on the window sill. The ferris wheel glittered far away, rising and dipping, carrying strangers to the very top. She remembered envying the small silhouettes inside, wondering what it felt like to see the world from there, weightless, held by something bigger than herself.</p><p>She had never been invited. Never been allowed. Never felt it could be hers.<br/>And now—here she was. At the very top.<br/>Not looking through a window. Not watching someone else live it.<br/>But experiencing it.<br/> With Rio.</p><p>The ride reached its apex.<br/>Stillness. Silence.<br/> The carnival spread glittering below them, the stars far above.<br/> Agatha turned to Rio.<br/>No hesitation this time.<br/> Rio leaned forward slowly, tenderly, giving her every chance to pull away.</p><p>Agatha met her halfway.</p><p>Their lips brushed, soft, sweet, warm in the cool night air. The world stilled around them. The kiss deepened just a breath more, their hands tightening together, their foreheads brushing gently as they parted.</p><p>Rio’s voice was barely a whisper. “I’m glad I got to show you this.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet breath, her chest tight with something she did not yet dare name.<br/> “I’m glad too.”</p><p>As the ferris wheel carried them slowly back toward earth, she held Rio’s hand the entire way down.<br/>And for the first time in her life, she didn’t envy the people at the top— because she had been one of them.</p>

<p>They were stepping off the ferris wheel platform, hands brushing, hearts still fluttering from the softness of the kiss they’d shared at the top, when a sudden vibration broke through the quiet hum of the empty carnival.</p><p>Agatha’s phone buzzed from inside her sweater pocket.</p><p>She paused, frowning slightly as she reached in and pulled it out.</p><p><strong>WESTVIEW GENERAL – ON-CALL LINE</strong><br/>
Her stomach tightened.</p><p>She answered immediately. “Dr. Harkness.”</p><p>“Doctor, sorry for the late call,” the charge nurse said, brisk and urgent. “Dr. Kale is still scrubbed into a vascular bleed. We need you for an emergency appendectomy — probable peritonitis. We’re prepping the patient now.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, all warmth and softness shifting into clinical precision. “I’ll be there in ten minutes.”</p><p>She ended the call.</p><p>Rio was already watching her, eyes steady and concerned. “Emergency?”<br/>
“Yes,” Agatha said, slipping the phone back into her pocket. “An appendix about to rupture. It can’t wait.”</p><p>Rio nodded once. “Come on. I’ll drive you.”</p><p>“Rio, I’m sorry, the date—”</p><p>“Hey,” Rio said gently, stepping closer. “This is more important.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to protest.<br/>
 Instead, she reached up and touched Rio’s arm in quiet gratitude. “Thank you.”</p><p>Rio smiled — soft, tender, grounding. “Always.”</p><p>She gave Rio’s arm a quick squeeze before Rio guided her back to the truck.</p><p><br/>
Rio pulled up to the ER entrance, truck idling beneath the bright hospital lights. Agatha unbuckled, hand hovering on the door handle before she looked back at Rio.</p><p>Rio gave her a small, encouraging smile. “Go save some lives.”</p><p>“Thank you Rio, I had a really great time tonight.” Agatha leaned in and kissed her — brief but warm, a promise more than a goodbye — then slipped out and hurried inside.</p><p>Once in the locker room, she changed into scrubs with quick, efficient movements. </p><p>Her cream sweater still held the faint scent of sugar and cool night air. Smiling, she folded it carefully before stepping into the scrub room.</p><p>At the sink, she washed up to her elbows with precise, practiced circles as the circulating nurse approached with a chart.</p><p>“Doctor Harkness, quick rundown,” the nurse said. “Vitals holding but trending down. No allergies. Ultrasound confirms inflammation and fluid. Symptoms started earlier today.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, letting the warm water steady her focus.</p><p>“Age?” she asked.</p><p>The nurse paused.</p><p>“He’s five,” she said quietly. “A five-year-old boy.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands stilled. Just for a moment. Just long enough for a cold knot to form under her ribs.</p><p>A child.</p><p>She inhaled, slow and controlled, forcing her breath into steadiness.<br/>
Then she shut off the water, lifted her chin, and said,<br/>
“I’m ready.”<br/>
And walked toward the OR doors.</p><p>The operation began smoothly.</p><p>Agatha made the incision cleanly, movements measured and sure.<br/>
 The little boy’s vitals held steady.<br/>
 The appendix was inflamed, dangerous, but manageable.</p><p>The OR hummed with the usual rhythm — beeps, murmurs, the soft clinking of instruments.<br/>
 Agatha focused entirely on the small, delicate field in front of her.</p><p>She was calm. Precise. In control.<br/>
Until she wasn’t.</p><p>Halfway through, the suction changed tone — a faint gurgle that shouldn’t have been there.<br/>
 Fluid pooled unexpectedly.<br/>
 A vessel she had not anticipated bled faster than it should have.</p><p>Complication.</p><p>Agatha felt the bottom drop out of her stomach.</p><p>“Pressure,” she said calmly, or so she thought. Her voice was quieter than usual.<br/>
 “Clamp. Now.”</p><p>The scrub nurse moved quickly, handing her exactly what she needed.</p><p>But as the bleeding continued, just a touch too heavy, just a beat too fast, her breath hitched.</p><p>And without warning—<br/>
A flash.<br/>
Nicky.<br/>

Small. Fragile. Lying on an OR table just like this one. Still. Exposed. Vulnerable.<br/>
 The overhead light reflecting on tiny ribs that should never be under surgical lamps.</p><p>Agatha’s heart slammed painfully against her chest.</p><p>She blinked, but the image didn’t disappear — it overlapped the child before her, merging horribly, impossibly.</p><p>Her fingers faltered.</p><p>“Doctor?” the scrub nurse said softly.</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond.</p><p>Her eyes remained fixed on the field, but her attention was slipping — spiralling — her breath growing shallow.</p><p>The anaesthesiologist shot the nurse a sharp look.<br/>
 The nurse nodded once, discreet but urgent, and reached for the wall phone.</p><p>“Page Dr. Kale to OR 1,” she said, voice low and steady.</p><p>Agatha barely heard her.</p><p>Her chest tightened, breath shortening, memories crashing too hard and too fast.<br/>
 She tried to speak — to say clamp, or suction, or anything — but her lips parted uselessly.</p><p>Her hands froze.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>The voice cut through the rising roar in her head.</p><p>Firm. Steady. Grounded.</p><p>Dr. Kale pushed through the OR doors, peeling off her gown from the previous surgery. She approached without hesitation, stepping to Agatha’s side.</p><p>“Talk to me,” Jen said quietly, only for her to hear. “What’s happening?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath shook. “It’s—he’s—”</p><p>Another flash. Nicky’s face. The ferris wheel lights. Rio’s hand in hers. The boy on the table.</p><p>Jen moved closer, her presence filling the space with stable, calm certainty.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said softly, pitched low so only she would hear. “Take a breath.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath came uneven, shallow. “I—he’s—he’s bleeding more than— I can’t—”</p><p>Her voice broke.</p><p>Jen stepped into her line of sight, blocking the surgical field just enough to anchor her back.</p><p>“Hey,” Jen said, steady, warm but firm. “Look at me.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were wide, unfocused.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen repeated, voice gentler now, “you’re not alone in here. I’m right beside you. The patient is stable. Listen to the monitor.”</p><p>Beep. Beep. Beep. <br/>
Steady.</p><p>“You’re safe,” Jen said. “He’s safe. You just got startled, that’s all. It happens.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat bobbed with a swallow. Her breathing faltered—then steadied, just slightly.</p><p>“Give me your eyes,” Jen coaxed.</p><p>Agatha forced herself to look up.<br/>
 Her vision sharpened, Jen’s face coming into focus.</p><p>“There you go,” Jen murmured. “Deep breath. You’re okay.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled, trembling.</p><p>“And again.”</p><p>She followed, the rush of panic slowly retreating from her limbs.</p><p>Jen waited until she saw clarity return to Agatha’s gaze.</p><p>Then—quietly, respectfully— “You lead, I’ll assist.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, nodded once, found her voice again.</p><p>“Clamp,” she said.</p><p>Steady. Focused. Returning.</p><p>Jen passed it to her without hesitation, staying close but letting Agatha take control.</p><p>Together, they moved through the complication with practiced precision.</p><p>The little boy’s vitals stayed stable.<br/>
 The bleeding slowed.<br/>
 The panic faded.</p><p>Agatha reclaimed the surgery— her hands sure again, her breath even, her mind sharp.</p><p>No one in the room said anything.</p><p>But every member of the OR team felt the moment she came back.</p><p>The boy was stable.</p><p>Alive.</p><p>Recovering.</p><p>Agatha walked out of the OR with her posture perfectly straight, her expression perfectly calm, and her insides in complete disarray.</p><p>She finished her charting on autopilot. Gave instructions to the night resident. Nodded politely to the nurses who told her, “Good save, Doctor.”</p><p>Then she stepped into the corridor, intending to disappear into her office or possibly the nearest supply closet and never come out.</p><p>She didn’t make it that far.</p><p>Jen was waiting for her.</p><p>Still in her surgical cap, mask around her neck, bags under her eyes from the double shift she’d just pulled. She’d washed up quickly after helping Agatha, but her eyes were on her colleague. </p><p>On her friend.</p><p>On the woman she’d just watched break in the OR.</p><p>“Agatha,” Jen said softly.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Jen stepped closer, her voice warm and steady. “Come on. Not out here.”</p><p>She guided Agatha down an empty hallway and into a small on-call room, closing the door behind them. </p><p>She didn’t turn on the overhead light — just the soft lamp on the desk, the gentler glow fitting the moment.</p><p>Agatha stood rigidly in the centre of the room.</p><p>Jen leaned against the counter, arms folded, gaze steady. Not judging. Not pitying. Just present.</p><p>“Talk to me,” Jen said quietly.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth.<br/>
 Nothing came out.</p><p>Her throat seized.<br/>
 Her breath hitched.</p><p>She hadn’t expected the spiral.<br/>
 Hadn’t expected the image.<br/>
 Hadn’t expected how violently it would shake her.</p><p>Finally she forced out, “I froze.”</p><p>Jen nodded slowly. “I saw.”</p><p>“It was a child.” Agatha’s voice cracked. “A little boy. And when the complication hit I—”</p><p>She stopped, pressing fingers to her temple, furious at the heat prickling behind her eyes.</p><p>Jen stepped toward her, cautious but sure. “Hey. It’s okay.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head sharply. “No. It isn’t. It can’t happen. Not to me. Not ever.”</p><p>Jen’s voice softened, but her words were firm. “Every surgeon has a moment.”</p><p>“Not like that,” Agatha hissed, voice shaking with humiliation and panic. “I didn’t just hesitate. I—”<br/>
 Her breath stuttered.<br/>
 “—I saw something that wasn’t there. And then I couldn’t move.”</p><p>Jen’s expression tightened with understanding, not curiosity. She didn’t ask what Agatha saw. She didn’t pry. </p><p>She knew better.</p><p>She reached out, placing a warm hand on Agatha’s forearm. “You came back.”</p><p>“It took you walking in,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Jen squeezed her arm gently. “You know what I saw when I walked in?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, looking away.</p><p>“I saw a brilliant surgeon mid-spiral,” Jen said, voice soft but strong. “And I saw her fight her way back in seconds. I saw her finish the case flawlessly. I saw her save a child’s life.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flickered, uncertain. “You’re being generous.”</p><p>“No,” Jen said simply. “I’m being honest.”</p><p>A long beat.</p><p>Jen stepped closer. “Agatha… you’ve been carrying a lot. More than you admit. More than anyone should without breaking eventually.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tensed. “I don’t break.”</p><p>Jen smiled sadly. “Everyone breaks. The strong ones just know how to put themselves back together afterward.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath trembled.</p><p>Jen watched her a moment, then added softly, “And for what it’s worth… I’m glad you let me be there with you.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, a single tear slipping down against her will.</p><p>Jen pretended not to see it.</p><p>She stepped back just enough to give Agatha space to breathe, but not enough to make her feel alone. Her voice softened, the edges rounding with something almost… vulnerable.</p><p>“You know,” Jen began, leaning lightly on the counter, “you’re not the only surgeon who’s ever frozen.”</p><p>Agatha scrubbed a hand over her face. “It doesn’t happen to me.”</p><p>“It didn’t happen to me either,” Jen said quietly. “Not until it did.”</p><p>Agatha looked up.</p><p>Jen didn’t usually talk about herself. </p><p>“It was during my second year of med school,” Jen continued, eyes drifting somewhere far away. “We were home for the holidays. My dad and I were in the kitchen making breakfast. He was laughing at something stupid I’d said.”</p><p>Her voice caught—not much, but enough.</p><p>“And then he grabbed the counter. Went pale. Collapsed.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stilled.</p><p>“I knew what to do,” Jen said. “I’d studied it a hundred times. But when it was him? When he was lying there on the floor?”<br/>
 She shook her head, swallowing.<br/>
 “I froze. Completely. I couldn’t even call 911 at first. My mom had to do it.”</p><p>“Jen…” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“I did compressions,” Jen said, voice small. “But I was dead inside the whole time. I wasn’t a doctor. I was just a terrified kid trying to save her dad.”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, instinctively, silently offering support.</p><p>“He died,” Jen said simply. Not harsh. Not dramatic. Just fact. “And for weeks I couldn’t walk into class without shaking. I almost dropped out of med school.”</p><p>Agatha’s brows drew tight with shock. “You never said—”</p><p>“Of course I didn’t,” Jen said with a dry smile. “We don’t advertise this stuff. We pretend we’re invincible. That nothing touches us.”</p><p>She sighed, eyes softening.</p><p>“But things do touch us, Agatha. Especially the things that matter.”</p><p>A beat passed.</p><p>“I got therapy,” Jen said. “A lot of it. I learned how to breathe again. How to separate the past from the patient in front of me. How to trust myself after falling apart.”</p><p>Her gaze met Agatha’s, steady and warm.</p><p>“And I still became a damn good doctor.”</p><p>“You’re one of the best,” Agatha said without hesitation.</p><p>Jen shrugged lightly. “So are you. One moment in the OR doesn’t change that.”</p><p>Agatha looked away, jaw tight. “It felt like more than a moment.”</p><p>“I know,” Jen said gently. “And that’s exactly why you need to talk about it. Not tonight, maybe. But soon.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted in the smallest, softest fracture. “I thought I was past this.”</p><p>Jen touched her arm again, warm and deliberate. “We’re never past being human.”</p><p>A long breath left Agatha—slow, controlled, but heavy with the truth of it.</p><p>Jen gave her a small, knowing smile.<br/>
 “Go home. And if you can’t sleep… call Rio. Trust me.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Jen.”</p><p>“What?” Jen lifted both hands. “I’m just saying. She’d show up. And you… you could use someone in your corner tonight.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t argue.\</p><p>She didn’t have the strength to pretend she didn’t want exactly that.</p><p><br/>
Agatha changed in silence.</p><p>The locker room was dim, lit only by the flickering fluorscent light over the sinks. She peeled off her scrubs with slow, heavy movements and slipped back into her clothes. Her cream sweater felt softer than she remembered, like a piece of the night that had been stolen from her.</p><p>She tied her hair back, then let it fall again. She didn’t know what she needed.<br/>
 Only that she felt… brittle.</p><p>Before leaving, she walked up one floor and stopped just outside Lilia’s room.</p><p>The door was half-open, the lights inside low. Lilia was fast asleep, curled on her side, breathing deep and easy. A cup of tea sat untouched on the bedside table, now cold.</p><p>Agatha stepped inside quietly.</p><p>She didn’t speak.<br/>
 Didn’t move further in.</p><p>She just watched her for a moment, the soft rise and fall of her chest, the gentle relaxation in her features and let herself breathe. Just once. Just long enough to feel something settle.</p><p>“Goodnight mom” Agatha whispered under her breath, barely audible. </p><p>She slipped out and headed for the exit.</p><p>The night air hit her like a wave — cool, sharp, and almost cleansing. She pulled her sweater tighter around her, hugging it close as she stepped beneath the yellow glow of the streetlights.</p><p>Only then did she pull out her phone.</p><p>A new text from Rio waited for her.</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Hey. How did the surgery go?</em></p><p>Agatha stared at the message for a long time.<br/>
 She considered telling the truth — the spiral, the freeze, the way she’d seen something that wasn’t there.<br/>
But the words wouldn’t come.</p><p>Her fingers moved slowly.</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: <em>It… didn’t go too well.</em></p><p>She hit send before she lost her nerve.</p><p>The three dots appeared almost immediately, then vanished.</p><p>Then her phone started to ring.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Agatha answered on the second ring, breath unsteady. “Hey, I—”</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice was soft, but laced with concern. “What happened?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth—to give a practiced, controlled answer.<br/>
 Instead, her breath hitched.</p><p>“I—” She stopped, trying again.<br/>
 “Rio… I froze.”</p><p>There was a beat of silence on the line.</p><p>Then Agatha’s voice cracked. “It was a little boy and I— I couldn’t move, I…”<br/>
 Her breath broke apart, shaky and uneven. “I don’t freeze. I don’t— I shouldn’t—”</p><p>Rio inhaled sharply.</p><p>“Hey, its okay.” Her tone changed instantly—soft, anchoring, no hesitation. “Are you still at the hospital?”</p><p>Agatha pressed a hand to her forehead. “Yes.”</p><p>“Where exactly?”</p><p>“The front entrance,” Agatha managed, her voice small.</p><p>“Okay. Stay there.”<br/>
 Rio’s voice was steady, firm, with exactly zero room for argument. “Don’t move. I’m coming right now.”</p><p>“Rio, you don’t have to—”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said gently but with iron underneath, “I want to. And I’m already in my truck.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>Her breath trembled—not with panic now, but relief.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered.</p><p>“Stay where you are,” Rio repeated. “I’ll be there soon.”</p><p>The call ended, but Agatha didn’t move.</p><p>She stood under the hospital canopy, hugging her sweater tighter, tears still drying on her cheeks—waiting for the familiar growl of Rio’s truck to pull into the car park, carrying the one person she realised she desperately needed right now.</p><p>The growl of the black truck came before Agatha even saw the headlights.</p><p>She didn’t move.<br/>
 Couldn’t.</p><p>The truck pulled right up to the entrance, braking gently. The door flew open, and Rio was out before the engine had even settled.</p><p>She’d changed into grey sweats, a dark hoodie, hair pulled back loosely.</p><p>Rio reached her in three long strides.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio murmured, voice low and warm, and she cupped Agatha’s face with both hands, thumbs brushing away the dried tracks beneath Agatha’s eyes before fresh ones could fall. “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t know whether to crumble or stand taller.</p><p>It ended up being a bit of both.</p><p>Rio slid one arm around her back, pulling her into a steady, grounding hug. Agatha’s fingers curled into the front of Rio’s hoodie, not tight, but enough to betray how badly she needed something—someone—solid.</p><p>Rio didn’t ask questions.<br/>
 Didn’t push.<br/>
 Just held her until Agatha’s shoulders finally, finally loosened.</p><p>“Come on,” Rio whispered near her temple. “Let’s get you out of here.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled. A small, shaky nod.</p><p>Rio opened the passenger door, guiding her gently into the seat, buckling her in with careful, quiet movements like she was something precious. She circled around, climbed in, and drove with one hand on the wheel and the other resting palm-up between them—an invitation.</p><p>Agatha took it.</p><p>Their fingers wove together.</p><p>They drove in silence for a minute, Agatha staring out the window, Rio glancing at her every so often like she was checking a heartbeat.</p><p>Finally, Agatha’s voice broke through the quiet, small and uncertain.</p><p>“Where are we going?”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand gently. “My place,” she said softly. “I don’t want you to be alone right now.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath trembled at that—because she hadn’t realised how deeply she didn’t want to be alone either.</p><p>The apartment lights clicked on with a warm amber glow when Rio unlocked the door, ushering Agatha inside first.</p><p>It was nothing like Agatha expected.</p><p>Soft.<br/>
 Warm.<br/>
 Lived-in.</p><p>Plants everywhere, with lush vines draped along bookshelves and succulents clustered on the coffee table. The space felt like it breathed.</p><p>A guitar leaned against the couch, something told her it was clearly Alice’s, judging by the paint chips on the neck and the heavy metal stickers along the case.</p><p>Art prints lined the walls—local pieces, small and colourful. A mismatched but charming set of blankets folded over the back of the couch. </p><p>It felt… safe.</p><p>Agatha stopped just inside the doorway, taking it all in.</p><p>Rio watched her with quiet, nervous eyes. “Um. It’s not fancy. Alice calls it our ‘queer gremlin nest.’ I keep threatening to buy actual matching furniture but—”</p><p>“It’s…” Agatha swallowed, the word surprising even herself. “Beautiful.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders dropped in relief. “Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha nodded once. Slowly. </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, her voice gentling. “Come sit.”</p><p>She guided Agatha to the couch, helping her settle into a nest of blankets without making it feel like she thought Agatha was fragile.</p><p>But Agatha<em> felt</em> fragile.</p><p>Once they sat, Rio tucked one knee onto the cushion, facing her. “Do you want tea? Water? Space? A pillow to scream into?”</p><p>Agatha startled at a soft laugh she didn’t know she’d made. “Just… stay.”</p><p>Rio nodded immediately and reached for her hand again.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers slid into hers without hesitation.</p><p>The apartment was quiet. No Alice, no prying eyes, no hospital lights, no buzzing machines. </p><p>Just Rio. </p><p>Warm. Safe. Present.</p><p>And for the first time that night, Agatha let herself lean, just slightly into Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>She let the warmth of Rio’s shoulder steady her, just long enough for her breath to even out. The room hummed with stillness — low lamplight, soft blankets, the faint sound of a neighbour’s TV through the wall. </p><p>Nothing sharp. Nothing loud. Nothing demanding.</p><p>Just space.</p><p>After a long moment, Agatha’s voice broke through the quiet.</p><p>“I froze.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move, didn’t stiffen. She only turned her head slightly, listening.</p><p>“In the OR,” Agatha continued, her voice thin. “I froze. It was a child—my first since…” She swallowed, unable to finish that sentence. “And I didn’t handle it well.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand but didn’t speak, letting Agatha guide the pace.</p><p>Agatha stared down at her fingers curled around Rio’s. “Lilia told me months ago I should get help. Therapy. A professional. I dismissed her at the time… assumed she was being dramatic, emotional, over involved.”</p><p>A humourless breath escaped her. “She was right.”</p><p>Rio stayed still, patient.</p><p>“Tonight proved it,” Agatha whispered. “I can’t risk freezing again. Not with someone’s child on that table. Not ever.”</p><p>The admission seemed to drain something from her — a defence, a wall, something she’d kept upright for years.</p><p>Her voice wavered. “But I’m scared. Scared they’ll admit that I’m broken.”</p><p>Rio finally moved. Slowly. Carefully. She tugged Agatha’s hand into both of hers and guided it to rest against her chest, right over her heart.</p><p>“Look at me,” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha did — reluctantly, vulnerably.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were soft, steady, unwavering. </p><p>“Being scared doesn’t mean you’re broken, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha blinked fast, jaw tight. “It feels like it.”</p><p>Rio shook her head gently. “It means you care. Deeply. It means you’re human. And it means you’ve been carrying too much alone.”</p><p>Agatha looked away, shame prickling the edges of her vision. “I hate that I couldn’t control it.”</p><p>“Then we work on it,” Rio said, simple as breath. “With someone trained to help you through it. You don’t have to pretend anymore.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. “I’m not good at… this. Needing things.”</p><p>Rio’s thumb brushed her knuckles. “You’re allowed to need things. Even help.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath faltered.</p><p>A flush of self-awareness crept up her neck — sharp, humiliating, impossible to ignore. She straightened slightly, not pulling away but trying to reassemble the pieces of her composure.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said quietly.</p><p>Rio frowned, not in anger but confusion. “What for?”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped to their intertwined hands. “This is… new. With you.” <br/>
A shaky exhale. <br/>
“And now here I am, falling apart on your couch like some melodramatic mess.”</p><p>Her words were tight, brittle around the edges. “You didn’t sign up for this. For me like this.”</p><p>Rio shifted closer, her knee brushing Agatha’s. “Hey,” she whispered, tilting her head to catch Agatha’s eyes. “Look at me.”</p><p>Reluctantly, Agatha did.</p><p>Rio’s face softened with something warm and breathtakingly sincere. “You don’t ever have to apologise for being yourself with me.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>“This isn’t too much,” Rio said gently. “<em>You’re</em> not too much.”</p><p>Agatha blinked rapidly, tears threatening again, her voice unsteady. “I just… I didn’t want the first time you brought me here to be like this.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened, and she reached up, brushing a thumb across Agatha’s cheekbone. She didn’t wipe a tear or rush her, just offered a gentle, steady touch meant to ground her.</p><p>The breath caught in Agatha’s throat.</p><p>She couldn’t remember the last time someone had touched her with that kind of tenderness. Not clinical or obligatory. Not careful in a detached, professional way. This was human and soft, warm with intention, full of quiet care. It made her chest ache in a way she hadn’t expected.</p><p>She felt seen, not as Dr. Harkness or the woman who never falters, but as herself. </p><p>Simply herself.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered closed for a moment, overwhelmed by how unfamiliar and devastatingly comforting that small gesture felt.</p><p>Rio kept her voice low and warm. “Agatha, you trusted me enough to let me be there for you. That means more to me than anything else would.”</p><p>A quiet breath left Agatha, unsteady but real.</p><p>“And for what it’s worth,” Rio added softly, “I’m really glad you’re here.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in again, letting her forehead rest against Rio’s shoulder without overthinking it. She let herself be held because she needed it, and because Rio offered it so naturally.</p><p>Rio wrapped her arms around her, steady and sure, as if holding her like this was not a burden but something she wanted.</p><p>Agatha let herself be held, sinking into the warmth of Rio’s embrace. She drew in a slow breath and caught the faint trace of Rio’s cologne mingled with her own natural, earthy scent. It was warm and smoky and clean, something that wrapped around Agatha’s senses and pulled her down from the ledge she’d been clinging to all night.</p><p>She exhaled shakily, then breathed in again, this time steadier.</p><p>Rio’s hand moved in slow, reassuring strokes along her back. Not pushing, not coaxing anything more from her. Just reminding her she wasn’t alone. The simple weight of it grounded her more than she wanted to admit.</p><p>The tension in Agatha’s shoulders finally began to loosen. Her breath evened out, no longer sharp or trembling. Each inhale felt a little fuller, each exhale a little less fragile. The panic that had gripped her earlier softened into something quieter, something she could hold without being undone by it.</p><p>Rio didn’t speak. She didn’t need to.</p><p>Agatha’s breathing settled into a slow, steady rhythm, her cheek resting against Rio’s chest. The rise and fall beneath her was soothing, hypnotic, and the warmth of Rio’s arms around her created a cocoon she hadn’t realised she needed so desperately.</p><p>Her eyelids grew heavy.</p><p>Rio noticed, softening her hold but never letting go. She shifted just enough to let Agatha rest more comfortably against her, brushing a hand once more through her hair.</p><p>Within minutes, Agatha drifted.</p><p>Not a deep sleep.<br/>
 Not peaceful, exactly.<br/>
 But safe.</p><p>Her body softened, tension unwinding as she let herself surrender to the warmth and quiet. Rio stayed still, hardly daring to move, one hand resting reassuringly at Agatha’s back, the other holding her hand loosely.</p><p>For a small, quiet eternity, Agatha slept.</p><p>Until a soft clicking noise broke through the quiet.</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed, the sound tugging her from sleep. She didn’t move at first—Rio’s arm was still around her, warm and secure. But then the click came again, followed by a whisper.</p><p>Agatha pried one eye open.</p><p>At the front door stood Jen and Alice.</p><p>Jen’s face was split into the smuggest, most self-satisfied smirk Agatha had ever seen. Pure “I knew it” energy radiated off her like a spotlight.</p><p>Alice, beside her, had clasped both hands over her mouth, her eyes sparkling like she’d walked in on the most adorable thing she had ever witnessed in her entire life. She swayed a little, whispering something like “Oh my god” under her breath.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Absolutely froze, still half-draped against Rio’s chest.</p><p>Rio stirred, blinking awake with a soft hum, her arm tightening instinctively before she realised why Agatha had gone rigid. She glanced up—and immediately sat up straighter, cheeks flushing.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio croaked, voice still thick with sleep. “Uh. Hey?”</p><p>Jen crossed her arms, looking delighted. “Well, well, well.”</p><p>Agatha wanted the earth to open and swallow her.</p><p>Alice stepped in farther, soft-voiced and beaming. “You two look so cozy.”</p><p>Jen planted a hand on her hip and grinned like the cat that stole the whole damn dairy farm. “Wow. I mean… I told you to call Rio, not jump into her lap, but you go girl.”</p><p>Agatha sat up too fast, hair wildly mussed, sweater wrinkled, eyes wide. “I was not— I didn’t— This isn’t—”</p><p>Jen nodded, pretending to take notes. “Sure, sure. Absolutely not in her lap. Zero laps involved.”</p><p>Agatha pressed a hand to her forehead, wishing for immediate death. “This is mortifying.”</p><p>Rio leaned close, whispering to her with a soft smile, “It’s really okay.”</p><p>Jen dropped her bag and kicked off her shoes. “Honestly? I love this for you. For both of you. Continue.”</p><p>Agatha groaned.</p><p>Rio’s hand slid gently to her back. “They’re fine,” she whispered. “And I’m glad you stayed.”</p><p>Agatha peeked at her through her fingers… then dared another glance at Jen and Alice, who were now whispering excitedly like they were watching the season finale of their favourite show.</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily. “I… should go.”</p><p>Rio blinked, surprised. “You don’t have to rush out.”</p><p>“I do,” Agatha murmured, patting herself down for her phone. “I’m due back at the hospital in…”<br/>
She finally found it on the coffee table and checked the time. Her stomach dropped. “Forty-eight minutes, actually.”</p><p>“Look at that,” Jen said, smirking. “We leave you two alone for a couple of hours and come home to spooning and emotional breakthroughs.”<br/>
 She winked at Rio. “Nice work.”</p><p>Rio covered her face with her hand. “Goodnight, Jen.”</p><p>“I’ll bet it was.” Jen teased, letting Alice drag her toward the kitchen. </p><p>Alice swatted her. “Stop. Let them say goodbye.”</p><p>The moment they disappeared into the kitchen, the apartment grew quiet again.</p><p>Rio turned to Agatha, still soft from sleep, her hoodie rumpled, her hair a little messy. Somehow it made her even more beautiful.</p><p>“I’ll drive you,” Rio said gently, reaching for the truck keys.</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “No. I should walk. It’ll help me wake up.”</p><p>Rio hesitated but didn’t push. “Let me at least walk you to the door.”</p><p>Agatha nodded.</p><p>They made it three steps before Agatha felt Rio’s hand brush lightly against the small of her back — not guiding, just present. She didn’t pull away.</p><p>At the door, Agatha turned to her. Rio’s expression was quiet and warm, concern woven through every line of her face.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said softly. “For tonight. For… everything.”</p><p>Rio smiled, a small, slow curve of her lips that seemed to melt something inside Agatha’s ribs. <br/>
“Anytime.”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer without really thinking. “I mean it.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio murmured.</p><p>It happened before Agatha could second-guess it.<br/>
She leaned in and kissed her.</p><p>Not rushed. Not desperate. Just a tender, lingering kiss that held the gratitude, the exhaustion, the fear, and the comfort of the night all in one.</p><p>Rio stilled — then melted.</p><p>Absolutely melted.</p><p>Her hand slid up to cup the side of Agatha’s jaw, her thumb brushing lightly beneath her cheekbone in that way that made Agatha’s entire chest tighten. Rio kissed her back softly, carefully, like she didn’t want to overwhelm her but couldn’t help wanting to be close.</p><p>When Agatha finally pulled back, Rio was a little breathless, eyes soft like warm honey.</p><p>“Text me when you get there,” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha nodded, heart thudding. “I will.”</p><p>She walked down the apartment steps slowly, the early morning air cool against her flushed skin. Her pulse was still fluttering, unsteady from the kiss she and Rio had shared. She could still feel the imprint of Rio’s thumb on her jaw and the soft press of her lips, warm and careful lin a way that made Agatha’s breath catch even now.</p><p>Behind her, the apartment door clicked shut, but she could almost sense Rio still standing there, leaning in the doorway with that dazed, sweet smile.</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet breath.</p><p>Then a small, genuine smile found its way onto her face—one she didn’t have to force.</p><p>The street was quiet at this hour. A pale blue glow had begun to touch the horizon, the world just starting to wake. Agatha wrapped her cardigan tighter around herself and started toward the hospital.</p><p>She tried to focus on the shift ahead, on the charts and updates waiting for her. But her mind kept drifting back to the moment Rio kissed her back, soft and certain, like she wanted Agatha just as she was.</p><p>That thought settled somewhere deep inside her.</p><p>For months, she’d felt like she was unraveling one thread at a time. Pretending she was coping. <br/>
Pretending she didn’t need anyone. Pretending that being strong meant being alone.</p><p>But tonight… something shifted.</p><p>Agatha slowed her pace, letting the realisation wash through her gently.</p><p>She could see herself getting better.</p><p>Not overnight.<br/>
 Not magically.<br/>
 Not without effort.</p><p>But she could picture it—a version of herself who wasn’t constantly braced for impact, who didn’t freeze at shadows from the past, who wasn’t carrying every burden alone.</p><p>And Rio… Rio made that feel possible.</p><p>Not because she fixed anything.<br/>
 But because she listened.<br/>
 Held her.<br/>
 Treated her like she was worth gentleness.<br/>
 Made space for her to be human.</p><p>Agatha’s chest warmed at the memory. Healing didn’t seem like a distant, unreachable thing anymore. It felt like something she could move toward, one careful step at a time.</p><p>Her phone buzzed softly in her pocket.</p><p>Rio.</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> <em>Let me know when you get there. </em></p><p><em>Please.</em></p><p>Agatha’s smile deepened.</p><p>She typed back,</p><p><br/>
<strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I’m okay. Walking in now.</em></p><p><em> Thank you for… tonight.</em></p><p>She hesitated, then added,</p><p><br/>
<strong>Agatha:</strong> <em>I’m glad I ended up with you.</em></p><p>She slipped her phone away and walked into the early morning calm with a steadier breath, a lighter heart, and the quiet certainty that she didn’t have to face any of this alone anymore.</p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha had barely stepped onto the ward when Billy practically skidded up to her, tablet in hand, eyes bright with curiosity.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness!” he said, slightly out of breath. </p><p>“I heard you did an emergency appendectomy last night. On a kid! I can’t believe I missed it—I was off shift.”<br/>
 He made a dramatic groan. “The one time something exciting happens.”</p><p>Agatha paused.</p><p>The hallway smelled like the usual antiseptic and coffee. Nurses moved around her, machines beeped softly, and somewhere down the corridor someone laughed. It was all so normal.<br/>
 Too normal.</p><p>Her chest tightened.<br/>
 Just a little.<br/>
 The memory flashed again—the small body on the table, the sudden bleeding, her frozen hands.</p><p>Billy continued, oblivious. “Oh, and you still need to do the post-op checks on him this morning. I can grab his chart—”</p><p>For a moment, Agatha felt her breath shorten.<br/>
 A hint of the panic from the night before flickered at the edge of her mind.<br/>
 Not as sharp.<br/>
 Not overwhelming.<br/>
 But present.<br/>
 Waiting.</p><p>She stood very still.</p><p>And then— unbidden— the memory of Rio’s arms around her surfaced.</p><p>Warm.<br/>
 Steady.<br/>
 Safe.</p><p>The quiet rise and fall of Rio’s breathing beneath her cheek.<br/>
 The scent of cologne and something earthy and grounding.<br/>
 The gentle way Rio had whispered,  “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled slowly.</p><p>Exhaled even slower.</p><p>The panic eased.</p><p>Not completely.<br/>
 But enough.</p><p>She looked at Billy, who was still talking a mile a minute, and for the first time in hours, not only did her chest loosen…</p><p>She smiled.</p><p>A small one, but real.</p><p>“Well,” she said, voice calm again, “let’s go then.”</p><p>Billy blinked, pleasantly surprised. “Really? Great! He’s in recovery. He’s doing fine—vitals stable all morning. I can’t wait to see the incision, your sutures are always so—”</p><p>“Teen,” she said with mild warning.</p><p>He snapped to attention. “Right. Professional. I am a professional.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, amused despite herself, and walked beside him toward the recovery room.</p><p>Her steps felt lighter than they should have.</p><p>Because she wasn’t walking them alone, not really.</p><p>She carried Rio’s steadiness with her.</p><p>Agatha knocked softly before pushing open the door. Billy trailed behind her, clutching the chart like it was a golden ticket.</p><p>Inside, the recovery room was quiet except for the soft beeping of a monitor and the low hum of the air vent.<br/>
 The little boy—small, pale, barely five—sat curled up on the bed with his knees tucked to his chest. His mother sat beside him, eyes swollen and exhausted from a night of worry.</p><p>The moment Agatha stepped in, the boy’s chin wobbled and he let out a frightened sniffle.</p><p>The mother shot up, frazzled but polite. “Doctor Harkness. Thank you again for… everything. He’s just… he’s scared. He hasn’t stopped crying.”</p><p>Agatha softened instantly. “That’s alright. It’s been a very big day for him.”</p><p>She approached the bedside slowly, careful not to loom or rush.</p><p>“May I have a look at your belly?” she asked the boy gently.</p><p>He shook his head and whimpered, shrinking into his mother’s side.</p><p>Billy stepped forward, bright and earnest. “Hey, champ, it won’t hurt. Promise. Dr. Harkness stitched you up better than anyone.”</p><p>Agatha shot him a look, but the mother managed a tired smile.</p><p>She crouched down so she was eye-level with the boy. “You’re very brave,” she said softly. “I just need to make sure you’re healing well. That way you can go home sooner.”</p><p>The boy whimpered again, clutching the blanket. “I want Bear.”</p><p>The mother rubbed his back helplessly. “We can’t find his stuffed bear. He always sleeps with it. I didn’t think to grab another toy and now he’s terrified.”</p><p>Agatha felt something twist gently in her chest.</p><p>A missing bear.<br/>
 A frightened child.<br/>
 Hands shaking because the world suddenly felt too big.</p><p>She thought for a moment.<br/>
Then stood abruptly.</p><p>“I’ll be right back.”</p><p>Billy blinked. “Should I—?”</p><p>“Stay here,” she said, voice soft but firm.</p><p>She moved quickly down the hall, through the staff door, and into the locker room.</p><p>Her locker sat exactly as she’d left it that morning. She opened it and froze for just a second.</p><p>There, on the top shelf, sat the little white bunny with the brown spots.</p><p>The one Rio had chosen for her.<br/>
 The one she’d tucked away, telling herself she didn’t need it.</p><p>She touched one of the floppy ears with her fingertips. For a moment she hesitated—then she picked it up.</p><p>It felt soft and warm in her hands.</p><p>Perfect for a frightened child.</p><p>Agatha closed the locker gently and made her way back.</p><p>The mother looked up as Agatha returned, confusion flickering in her tired eyes.</p><p>Agatha approached the bed slowly and knelt again, holding out the stuffed bunny.</p><p>“I thought you could use a friend,” she said softly.</p><p>The little boy hiccuped mid-cry, his red eyes widening. He reached out with both hands like he couldn’t believe it was real. When his fingers curled around the rabbit’s soft ear, something in him shifted.</p><p>He hugged it instantly.</p><p>The crying stopped.</p><p>Completely.</p><p>The mother pressed her hands to her mouth, tears springing to her eyes. “Oh my god… thank you. You have no idea how much that means.”</p><p>Agatha allowed herself a small smile. “He needs comfort. That matters too.”</p><p>Billy leaned toward her and whispered, awe-struck, “Where did you get that?”</p><p>Agatha ignored him.</p><p>Instead, she checked the incision carefully while the little boy snuggled the rabbit into his chest, calmer now, breathing easier.</p><p>“You’re healing beautifully,” Agatha said quietly. “You did a very good job.”</p><p>He looked up at her over the bunny’s head and whispered, “Thank you, doctor.”</p><p>Then he hugged the rabbit tighter.</p><p>Agatha felt her chest warm in a way she wasn’t expecting—gentle, full, steady.</p><p>As she and Billy stepped out of the room, he whispered, “You’re gonna make me cry, Dr. H.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, though her eyes softened. “Come on, Teen. We have rounds.”</p><p>But as they walked away, she let herself smile—small, private, full of something she hadn’t felt in a long time.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>By the time Agatha made it to Lilia’s room, the door was half-open and voices floated out into the hallway. She pushed it the rest of the way gently.</p><p>Sharon was there, perched on the edge of the chair with a cup of vending-machine coffee in hand. Lilia, sitting up in her bed, was halfway into her cardigan, clearly preparing to leave.</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off-guard. “Sharon?”</p><p>Sharon looked up and smiled. “Oh Agatha dear, we were just talking about you.”</p><p>Lilia beamed. “Sharons giving me a ride home.”</p><p>Agatha stepped inside and instinctively reached for the chart at the foot of the bed. “You’re being discharged?”</p><p>Lilia smirked. “I told them I was sick of the food.”</p><p>Agatha scanned the papers so fast she nearly gave herself a papercut. “Who signed this?”</p><p>“Chief Romanoff,” Sharon answered, amused. “She swung by earlier.”</p><p>“Natasha gave her a clean bill of health?” Agatha repeated, flipping through a few more pages like the right answer might magically appear. “Already?”</p><p>“Almost clean,” Sharon corrected gently. “She wants her to take it easy for a few days. No heavy lifting, no stress, no overexerting herself.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “That’s vague medical terminology.”</p><p>Lilia rolled her eyes and reached for her bag. “It means I’m fine, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha planted a hand on the side of the bed, brow creasing. “You had<em> a heart attack</em> Lilia.”</p><p>“And I’m feeling better,” Lilia insisted, tying her cardigan. “I want to go home.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look convinced. “Your labs were—”</p><p>“Normal,” Lilia cut in. “If they weren’t, Natasha wouldn’t have let me out. You know that.”</p><p>Agatha went silent, still staring at the chart as if it might betray some hidden danger.</p><p>Sharon leaned forward, voice gentle. “Don’t worry dear. She’ll be with me all day.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders loosened—barely—but enough.</p><p>Lilia reached out, catching Agatha’s hand with a light squeeze. “Sweetheart. I’m alright.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled slowly, letting the tension leak out of her posture. “I just… wanted to be sure.”</p><p>Lilia softened. “I know. And I love you for it. But I’m not going to crumble if I leave the building.”</p><p>Sharon stood, looping Lilia’s bag over her shoulder. “Besides, she’ll have me and a very large pot of soup. Nothing will happen.”</p><p>Agatha finally closed the chart and set it aside. “Fine,” she muttered, though she sounded more relieved than annoyed. “But call me if anything changes.”</p><p>Lilia smiled warmly at her. “I will.”</p><p>Agatha lingered another moment, scanning Lilia’s face and posture one last time, just to reassure herself.<br/>
Then she nodded, the worry easing just a little.</p><p>“Alright,” she said quietly. “Let’s get you home.”</p><p>After making sure Lilia was safely buckled into Sharons jeep, Agatha approached the nurses’ station with her chart tucked under her arm, the weight of a long day finally pressing into her shoulders. She was minutes away from being done, already thinking about going home to shower, change, and maybe text Rio again.</p><p>But then she saw them.</p><p>Wanda and Jen were standing at the counter in fresh scrubs, coffee cups in hand, clearly just starting their night shift. Wanda looked focused and ready. Jen looked… suspiciously energised.</p><p>And smug.<br/>
 Far too smug.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, immediately assuming the worst.</p><p>“Glad to see you’re both easing into your shift with some light gossip,” she said dryly.</p><p>Wanda blinked and exchanged a confused look with Jen. “Gossip?”</p><p>Jen’s smirk deepened. “Hello to you too, sunshine.”</p><p>Agatha planted a hand on her hip. “I’m sure you’ve already told half the hospital what you walked in on this morning.”</p><p>Wanda’s brows shot up in alarmed interest. “What exactly did she walk in on?”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Jen laughed under her breath, delighted. “Wow. You confessed that fast.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha muttered, cheeks warming.</p><p>Wanda looked between them like she was watching a tennis match. “Should I be concerned?”</p><p>Jen held up one finger. “Let me clarify something before Agatha implodes. I didn’t tell anyone anything.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, unconvinced. “You were smirking when I arrived.”</p><p>“I smirk all the time,” Jen said. “It’s part of my charm.”</p><p>Wanda stepped closer to Agatha, curious. “So… what happened this morning?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha said too quickly. “Absolutely nothing.”</p><p>Jen sipped her coffee loudly. “For the record, I would never share your personal business on the floor.” <br/>
She nodded at Wanda. “You seem to be doing a great job sharing it yourself.”</p><p>Wanda gasped and turned fully toward Agatha. “Oh my god. Did something happen with Rio?”</p><p>Agatha flushed a deeper shade and took a strategic step backward. “I’m going home.”</p><p>Jen called after her, “Let me know if you need help digging the hole deeper!”</p><p>Wanda’s voice followed too, bright with excitement. “Agatha, wait, I didn’t get details!”</p><p>Agatha stepped out through the sliding doors, the cool evening air brushing against her skin like a reminder to breathe. Her shift was finally over, and she had a plan: go home, shower,  check on Lilia.</p><p>But as she crossed the parking lot, a familiar pressure crept into her chest.<br/>
 Small.<br/>
 Quiet.<br/>
 Anxiety in its earliest form, curling in her ribs the same way it had earlier when Billy mentioned the boy.</p><p>She paused beside her car, fingers curling lightly at her sides, trying to steady her breath. She could feel the tension building in her shoulders, that old instinct to brace herself.</p><p>Her phone buzzed.</p><p>The sound alone eased something.</p><p>She pulled it out and saw Rio’s name.</p><p>A selfie filled the screen.</p><p>Rio stood in the firehouse kitchen wearing her navy duty T-shirt, a wooden spoon in her hand and a pot bubbling on the stove behind her. There was a smear of flour on her cheek that she clearly hadn’t noticed. </p><p>She looked tired, a little rumpled, but heartbreakingly warm and steady.</p><p>Her smile was crooked and teasing.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>: <em>On dinner duty tonight. </em></p><p><em>Made too much. </em></p><p><em>Come get some before the crew inhales it like pack animals.</em></p><p>A laugh escaped Agatha before she could stop it.<br/>
 A real one.</p><p>The anxiety that had been gathering inside her dissolved a little, like someone had brushed away the edges of a storm cloud.</p><p>Another message arrived.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>:<em> No pressure</em>.</p><p><em> Just thought of you could use some decent food.</em></p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment.</p><p>She thought about the little boy that morning, shaking and terrified.</p><p><br/>
 How his entire world shifted into calm the second she handed him the stuffed rabbit.</p><p><br/>
 How his breathing evened, how he clung to it like it was the one safe thing in the room.</p><p>And then the thought slipped into her mind with quiet honesty-<br/>
For him, the rabbit had been comfort.</p><p>For her… Rio felt like that.</p><p>A steadying presence.</p><p><br/>
 A soft place to land.</p><p><br/>
 Warmth after a long night.</p><p><br/>
 The first thing in a long time that made her feel genuinely safe.</p><p>Her comfort.</p><p>Her stuffed bunny.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes.</p><p>She looked at Rio’s selfie again, at the familiar warmth in her face, at the playful lift of her brow as she stirred whatever she was cooking for her crew. Something soft and certain settled in her chest.</p><p>She didn’t want to go home.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>She wanted to see her.</p><p>Agatha typed back.</p><p><strong>Agatha: </strong><em>Actually… I was thinking about you too. </em></p><p><em>I would like to see you. </em></p><p><em>Just for a bit, if thats okay?</em></p><p>Rio’s reply came immediately.</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong><em> You were?</em></p><p><br/>
<em>Yeah, of course. </em></p><p><br/>
<em>I’ll save you a plate.</em></p><p> </p><p>Agatha smiled.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Agatha:</strong><em> I’m on my way.</em></p><p> </p><p>She slipped her phone into her pocket, unlocked her car, and started the engine with a steadier heartbeat than she’d had all day.</p><p>She was going to the fire station.</p><p><br/>
 Because she wanted to see Rio.</p><p><br/>
 Because seeing Rio made everything feel lighter.</p><p><br/>
Because tonight, she needed her comfort too. </p><p> </p><p><br/>
Agatha stepped into the firehouse, the warm scent of garlic and tomatoes simmering on the stove drifting through the open garage bay. </p><p>The low rumble of conversation and clatter of dishes carried from the crew lounge.</p><p>She walked inside, smoothing her cardigan without thinking.</p><p>Rio was in the kitchen, sleeves pushed up, a wooden spoon in hand. She was focused on the pot in front of her until she glanced up and—</p><p>Froze.</p><p>A flush crept up her neck so fast Agatha almost saw it rise.</p><p>“You… came,” Rio said softly, eyes brightening in a way that made Agatha’s chest warm.</p><p>Before Agatha could reply, two familiar voices erupted from the table.</p><p>Bucky shot up from his chair like someone had lit a match under him. “Well, look who finally shows their face!”</p><p>Tony dropped his fork, hand over his heart. “Dr Harkness, in our humble kitchen? Is this real? Someone pinch me.”</p><p>Agatha lifted an eyebrow, amused. “Hello, boys.”</p><p>Bucky swaggered over, arms wide. “Maybe now you’re here Rio will shut up talking about you.”</p><p>Tony joined him, smirking. “Yeah, Agatha this, Agatha that. Ice queen has really done a number on our ickle Vidal.”</p><p>Rio groaned. “<em>Guys</em>, please shut the fuck up.”</p><p>Bucky clapped her on the back. “Please. We’ve been waiting for this.”</p><p>Tony leaned in, whispering loudly to Agatha, “You know she threatened to fight me once because I said your hair looked nice?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes went wide. “Tony—!”</p><p>Agatha blinked, then smiled. “Well… he wasn’t wrong.”</p><p>Bucky barked a laugh. “Oh she’s smooth. No wonder you’re down bad, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s face was absolutely crimson. “Can you both go… anywhere else?”</p><p>They ignored her completely.</p><p>“It’s good to see you, Agatha,” Bucky said warmly. </p><p>“Yeah,” Tony added, leaning casually against the counter. “Last time we saw you, Rio hadn’t defrosted you yet.”</p><p>Rio let out a suffering noise. “Oh my god.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved. “Well, things changed.”</p><p>Tony slapped Bucky’s arm. “See? A mature woman. Meanwhile Vidal over here nearly fainted when she got your text.”</p><p>Rio shoved him. “I did not—”</p><p>“She did,” Bucky confirmed.</p><p>Agatha hid a smile behind her hand.</p><p>Finally, Rio managed to cut through the chaos and stepped closer to her, voice gentler. “I saved you a bowl before they inhaled everything.”</p><p>From the table, Tony yelled, “Hey! We're not animals!”</p><p>Bucky added, “We are a little.”</p><p>Rio ignored them with exhausted affection and motioned Agatha closer to the stove. “It’s nothing fancy. But it’s warm.”</p><p>Agatha met her eyes. “I’m sure I’ll love it.”</p><p>Behind them, Tony whispered loudly, “She said <em>love</em>.”</p><p>Bucky let out a dramatic gasp. “Wedding bells. I hear them.”</p><p>Rio dropped her head into her hands. “I hate both of you so much.”</p><p>But Agatha saw the smile she was trying to hide.</p><p>Bucky noticed it too. “Alright, Vidal’s making that face. That’s our cue.”</p><p>Tony stood dramatically, grabbing his jacket. “Fine, let’s go do some actual work.”</p><p>Bucky added, “Or we can finish that fortnight campaign.”</p><p>Tony glared. “You’re on.”</p><p>They both waved as they headed toward the bay. “Have fun, lovebirds!”</p><p>Rio muttered, “I’m transferring stations,” but she sounded fond.</p><p>The moment the door swung shut behind them, the room quieted.</p><p>Rio handed Agatha a bowl and sat across from her. The dish smelled incredible—warm, rich, full of garlic and tomatoes, with soft dumpling-like pieces nestled in the sauce.</p><p>Agatha took a bite.</p><p>And nearly moaned.</p><p>She actually had to put the bowl down for a second, eyes fluttering closed. “What… what is this?”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, leaning her chin into her hand. “It’s called guiso de harina. A Puerto Rican stew. My abuela used to make it. Flour dumplings, sofrito, tomatoes, garlic, achiote… it’s simple but comforting.”</p><p>Agatha took another bite—slower this time, savouring it. “It’s delicious. I’ve never tasted anything like it.”</p><p>Rio smiled shyly. “I’m glad you like it.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, studying her with gentle curiosity. “Where are you from originally? Before Westview?”</p><p>Rio smiled softly. “Brooklyn was home for most of my life. But my family… we’re Puerto Rican.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes warmed. “Puerto Rico?”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah. My parents were from San Juan. They moved to New York when I was about three. Wanted better opportunities. Safer neighbourhoods. More stability, I guess.”</p><p>There was a beat—small, but heavy.</p><p>Agatha set her spoon down, sensing the shift. “Rio…?”</p><p>Rio drew in a breath, eyes drifting toward her bowl.</p><p>“They died,” she said quietly. “My parents. When I was ten. House fire. Wrong place, wrong time.” She swallowed, voice soft but steady. “I barely made it out.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart clenched. “Rio.”</p><p>Rio offered a small smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “My abuela came to take care of me after that. Moved states without blinking. She raised me. Taught me how to cook. Taught me how to be… decent.” </p><p>She shrugged a little. “She was everything.”</p><p>Agatha reached across the table without thinking and took Rio’s hand. Rio looked at her, a little surprised, but didn’t pull away.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” Agatha said softly.</p><p>Rio nodded once. “It was a long time ago. But… yeah. It shaped everything.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand gently. “Is that why you became a firefighter?”</p><p>Rio looked down at their joined hands.</p><p>“Partly,” she admitted. “I think I wanted to be who I needed that night. Someone strong enough to pull people out. Someone who runs toward the flames, not away from them.” She exhaled. “Also… I hate feeling helpless.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice lowered. “You’re not helpless. You’re the opposite.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes lifted to her, soft and warm.</p><p>Agatha held her gaze. “And for what it’s worth… your parents would be proud. And your abuela too.”</p><p>Rio’s lip trembled just barely—nothing dramatic, just a flicker of emotion she usually kept hidden.</p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha stroked her thumb gently over Rio’s knuckles.</p><p>For a moment they simply sat there, their hands joined across the small firehouse table, the stew still warm between them, the buzz of the station distant and muted. It felt almost suspended in time.</p><p>Rio drew in a steadying breath and lifted her gaze. “Can I tell you something?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Of course.”</p><p>Rio hesitated—just a second—and then the truth slipped out, quiet and unpolished.</p><p>“I’m really glad you came tonight,” she said. “I didn’t expect you to. Part of me thought you’d go home, sleep, forget all about the chaos of last night.” Her voice softened. “But you didn’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. “I wanted to see you.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers curled a little tighter around hers at that.</p><p>“I can’t seem to stop thinking about you,” Rio admitted. “This is all new for me. These feelings. This… pull toward someone.” She looked almost shy saying it. “I’ve never felt anything like this before. Not with anyone.”</p><p>Agatha felt something warm bloom inside her, spreading slowly through her ribs, her throat, her cheeks. </p><p>She hadn’t expected Rio to say it out loud. She hadn’t expected such openness, such gentle honesty.</p><p>She let their joined hands rest between them, her thumb tracing small circles over Rio’s skin.</p><p>“I feel the same,” Agatha said quietly.</p><p>Rio blinked, as if she wasn’t sure she’d heard right.</p><p>Agatha continued, her voice soft but certain. “You’ve changed everything for me. In ways I didn’t think were possible.” She inhaled, choosing her words carefully. “I’ve spent a long time being… closed off. Holding things together alone. Pretending I didn’t need anyone.”</p><p>Rio watched her, breath held.</p><p>“But then you,” Agatha whispered, “walked into my life. And somehow, without even trying, you made me feel… lighter. Safe. Like maybe I don’t have to brace myself for the worst all the time.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened into something almost reverent.</p><p>“And last night,” Agatha went on, her voice barely above a hush, “when I fell apart in that OR… you were the only person I wanted to call. The only person I knew would understand without judgment.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, her eyes shining with something deep and unmistakable.</p><p>“You make me believe I can get better,” Agatha finished. “You make me want to try.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward, forehead almost touching Agatha’s, her breath warm and steady.</p><p>“Agatha,” she whispered, “you already are.”</p><p>And Agatha, for the first time in years, felt it might be true.</p><p>Their hands were still intertwined on the table, warmth passing between their fingers in steady pulses.</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s breath hitch — just the slightest tremble — as if she were holding something back. Something that wanted to move forward.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate.</p><p>She leaned in.</p><p>Their lips met in a slow, deliberate kiss that felt like finally exhaling after holding her breath for far too long. Rio froze for only half a heartbeat before melting completely, her shoulders loosening, her hand lifting instinctively to cradle Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>Rio kissed her back with a soft certainty, as if she’d been waiting for this moment just as long. Agatha felt the warmth of Rio’s palm against her skin, grounding her, steadying her, pulling her closer without force — just pure intention.</p><p>Agatha’s free hand slipped to the back of Rio’s neck, fingertips threading gently into her hair. The kiss deepened by a fraction, their mouths moving together in a quiet, intimate rhythm that felt more like a confession than anything they had said aloud.</p><p>Rio let out a soft, breathy sound — part surprise, part relief — and Agatha felt it all the way down her spine.</p><p>When they finally separated, neither moved far.</p><p>Their noses brushed.</p><p><br/>
 Their breaths mingled.</p><p><br/>
 Agatha could feel Rio’s heartbeat under her fingertips.</p><p>Rio smiled first — small, dazed, entirely undone. “I don’t think I’ll ever get over how good that feels,” she whispered, voice warm and shaky.</p><p>Agatha brushed her thumb along Rio’s jaw, her own smile soft and full. “Yes,” she murmured. “Me too.”</p><p>Rio leaned in again, unable to stay apart for long.</p><p>And they kissed once more — slower, deeper, full of something steady and blooming, like the start of something neither of them could deny anymore.</p><p> </p>

<p>Sunlight spilled softly through the lace curtains of Lilia’s bedroom, casting warm patterns across the floor. The house was quiet, the early-hour calm that Agatha secretly loved — the soft hum of the kettle, the scent of fresh tea leaves, the muted creak of old floorboards.</p><p>She carried a mug of Lilia’s favourite morning tea into her room, chamomile with ginger, honey, and a hintof lemon.</p><p>Lilia was already stirring, blinking awake with the gentle curiosity of someone who had never once woken up once grumpy in her life.</p><p>When she noticed Agatha standing at the bedside, her face brightened instantly. “Good morning, sweetheart.”</p><p>Agatha softened without even meaning to. “Good morning.”</p><p>Lilia pushed herself up carefully, settling against the pillows as Agatha handed her the tea. “You spoil me,” she said, smiling into the steam.</p><p>“You just got out of the hospital,” Agatha reminded her, sitting on the edge of the bed. “I’m allowed to be dote on you.”</p><p>Lilia took a long sip, humming appreciatively. “Mmm. Perfect. You always know exactly how much honey I need.”</p><p>“Too much,” Agatha said with a small laugh. “That will be changing by the way.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes sparkled. “How are <em>you</em> feeling?”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her hands, folded neatly in her lap. “Fine,” she said automatically.</p><p>Lilia raised a brow.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Better,” she corrected. “Much better.”</p><p>“And that,” Lilia said, setting her tea aside, “is wonderful to hear.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>Not long. Just a second.<br/> Long enough for Lilia’s expression to soften further.</p><p>“I think,” she began, voice quiet but steady, “I’d like to take your advice.”</p><p>Lilia’s smile widened with understanding before Agatha even finished.</p><p>“I think it’s time I spoke with the therapist you mentioned. Dr. Strange.”</p><p>Lilia reached for her hand immediately, lifting it gently between both of hers. “Oh, sweetheart. I’m so proud of you.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders eased. “I’m… ready. I think I need it.”</p><p>“You do,” Lilia said kindly, “and that’s not a failing. Recognising it is strength.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Will you help me contact him?”</p><p>“Of course I will,” Lilia said. “I’ll call his office today and set up an appointment.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet breath, one she hadn’t realised she’d been holding.</p><p>Lilia watched her for a moment, eyes soft and full of that quiet wisdom she wielded better than anyone. </p><p>Then a slow smile curved her lips, one that told Agatha she’d been patient long enough.</p><p>“So,” Lilia said, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear with deliberate innocence, “are you finally going to tell me how your date went with Rio?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught completely off guard despite absolutely knowing this question was coming.</p><p>She looked down at her hands, suddenly very interested in the pattern of the duvet. “It was… nice.”</p><p>Lilia gave her a look. The <em>try again, I wasn’t born yesterday</em> look.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness,” she said, leaning forward with exaggerated anticipation, “I want details.”</p><p>Agatha felt the warmth rise to her cheeks before she could control it.</p><p>Lilia gasped softly, delighted. “Oh my god. You’re blushing.”</p><p>“I am not,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>“You absolutely are,” Lilia laughed, touching her arm. “Which means it went very well.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her gaze, the smallest smile playing at the corner of her mouth. “It did.”</p><p>Lilia clapped her hands once, triumphant. “Of course it did. She adores you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart fluttered in a way she couldn’t quite hide. “I’m…fond of her too.”</p><p>Lilia squeezed her hand, glowing with pride. “Good. Then tell me everything over breakfast.”</p><p>After Lilia finished her tea and promised to call Dr. Strange, Agatha ushered her gently out of bed and into her favourite chair at the kitchen table. Lilia settled in easily, wrapped in her soft cardigan, looking far more alert than someone freshly discharged from the hospital should.</p><p>Agatha moved around the kitchen with familiar ease, her white t-shirt loose and soft against her frame, grey sweats sitting low on her hips. Her hair was down, slightly messy from sleep but still somehow neat, and a pair of thick-rimmed glasses rested on her nose. She looked softer than she ever tried to be, almost unknowingly gentle, and there was a small, quiet happiness about her that Lilia noticed immediately.</p><p>She pulled out eggs, butter, and a handful of herbs, heating the pan with practiced efficiency. The soft sizzle of melting butter filled the room, warm and comforting.</p><p>Lilia leaned back against the chair, watching her fondly. “You don’t have to fuss over me.”</p><p>Agatha cracked two eggs cleanly into a bowl. “I know. But I like feeding <em>you</em> for a change.”</p><p>Lilia smiled into her mug, eyes warm. “Then fuss away.”</p><p>Agatha whisked the eggs, trying not to let Lilia’s gaze fluster her, though she could feel the scrutiny. </p><p>There was something different about her this morning. A looseness in her shoulders. A softness in the curve of her mouth. Her movements were lighter, almost content.</p><p>She poured the eggs into the pan, letting them cook slowly. The kitchen filled with the scent of butter and herbs, familiar and homey.</p><p>“So,” Lilia said casually, twisting her spoon between her fingers, “are you going to tell me about your date now?”</p><p>Agatha paused mid-stir, her expression tightening for just a moment before she shot Lilia a knowing look. “I knew you wouldn’t let that go.”</p><p>“Spill it Harkness,” Lilia said brightly. </p><p>Agatha sighed, but there was softness to it. She pushed the eggs gently around the pan. “Fine.”</p><p>Lilia leaned forward, delighted.</p><p>Agatha plated the scrambled eggs and set them in front of Lilia before sitting across from her. She hesitated for a moment, smoothing the napkin on her lap.</p><p>“It was… good,” she said quietly. “Better than I expected. Better than I’ve had in a long time.”</p><p>Lilia took a bite, gesturing with her fork. “Tell me everything, and start from the beginning.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved. “Rio picked me up. She brought flowers. And she was… nervous.”</p><p>Lilia gasped. “Nervous? Well of course she was, you <em>are</em> terrifying sometimes sweetheart.”</p><p>Agatha huffed lightly. </p><p>“She took me to a carnival. It was closed for the season, but she knew the owner from an inspection and called in a favour.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes widened. “She rented out a carnival for you.”</p><p>“It wasn’t—” Agatha stopped. “Yes. Fine. She did.”</p><p>Lilia clapped lightly. “That is romance.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile deepened as she continued to tell Lilia about the different rides they went on.</p><p>“And afterward,” Agatha said softly, “we kissed. It felt… right.”</p><p>Lilia reached across the table and took Agatha’s hand in both of hers. Her voice softened. “And how do you feel today?”</p><p>Agatha thought about Rio’s messages.<br/> The fire station.<br/> The food.<br/> The kiss.<br/> The way Rio’s forehead had rested against hers afterward.</p><p>She swallowed. “Happy,” she admitted. “Scared. But… happy.”</p><p>Lilia squeezed her hand. “Sweetheart, that’s all I’ve ever wanted for you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, touched. “I know.”</p><p>“And,” Lilia added gently, “she clearly makes you feel safe.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t deny it.</p><p>Because she finally knew it was true.</p><p>Lilia had just taken another bite of her eggs when a sound drifted faintly through the kitchen window—muffled voices, one of them unmistakably bright and chatty.</p><p>Agatha froze mid-sip of her tea, her brows knitting. “Do you hear that?”</p><p>Lilia grinned into her mug. “Oh, no. Sharon’s awake.”</p><p>Agatha stood halfway, peering out the window. “Who is she talking to t this hour?”</p><p>Lilia swiveled her spoon like a pointer. “Check the window.”</p><p>Agatha leaned closer to the glass and felt her breath catch.</p><p>Rio stood at the front path, still in her station sweats and boots, dark curls pulled back messily after her night shift. She held a small container of food in her hands—leftovers from her cooking the night before—and looked like she was trying very hard to smile politely as Sharon from next door gestured animatedly with both hands.</p><p>“It’s Rio?,” Lilia said, delighted. “Oh, that’s sweet.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond. She was too busy watching Rio’s face—earnest, tired, kind—while Sharon continued her enthusiastic saga about… whatever Sharon was always talking about.</p><p>Rio nodded politely every few seconds, but Agatha knew that look.</p><p>Trapped.</p><p>Lilia snorted. “If you don’t go out there, Sharon will keep her until dinner. Maybe tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha stepped back from the window. “Rio’s fine. Sharon is harmless.”</p><p>Lilia raised an eyebrow. “Sharon once told me the entire genealogy of her cat. From memory. For thirty minutes.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “She did that?”</p><p>“She still does that. Go save the poor girl before she learns the tragic backstory of Mr. Whiskerson.”</p><p>Agatha tried not to smile. She failed.</p><p>She tugged lightly at the hem of her white t-shirt, pushed her glasses up her nose, and brushed her messy-but-neat hair back from her face. Something fluttered in her chest—real, soft, impossible to ignore.</p><p>“Fine,” she said, pretending she was not already halfway to the door. “I’ll be five minutes.”</p><p>“Take your time,” Lilia called after her, thoroughly entertained. “Rio deserves a proper rescue.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, trying not to roll her eyes as she grabbed the doorknob. She was suddenly, acutely aware of her appearance — the loose white t-shirt, soft from dozens of washes, the grey sweats pooling comfortably at her ankles, her hair falling in a half-messy wave down her back, and the  glasses sliding slightly down her nose.</p><p>She didn’t look like Dr. Agatha Harkness.<br/> She looked… soft.<br/> Casual.<br/> Almost cozy.</p><p>The thought made her pause with a flutter of something she didn’t want to name.</p><p>Would Rio notice?<br/> Would she care?</p><p>Agatha inhaled and stepped outside.</p><p>The morning light caught her off guard — crisp, cool, and too honest. She cleared her throat and called, “Good morning, Sharon.”</p><p>Sharon whirled around instantly, bright as a spotlight. </p><p>“Oh, Agatha! I was just telling your friend here about my cat’s gluten sensitivity. Did you know most people completely overlook—”</p><p>But Agatha hardly heard her.</p><p>Because her eyes found Rio.</p><p>And everything else faded.</p><p>Rio stood with her hair pulled back in a tired half-knot, loose curls escaping everywhere. Her station cargos hung low on her hips, her navy t-shirt wrinkled from the long night shift. There were faint shadows under her eyes, and she held a small plastic container in both hands as if it were a peace offering.</p><p>But what stopped Agatha was the expression.</p><p>Soft.<br/> Warm.<br/> Relieved.</p><p>Rio’s face brightened the moment Agatha appeared, so subtly and so sincerely it made Agatha’s breath catch.</p><p>And then came the embarrassment.</p><p>Because Rio was looking at her — really looking — and Agatha became hyper-aware of her bare face, her messy hair, her cozy clothes, the way her glasses sat crooked on her nose.</p><p>She had never felt more unpolished.</p><p>Or more seen.</p><p>Sharon continued rambling in the background, but Rio’s eyes kept darting toward Agatha, like she couldn’t help it. She shifted her weight, rubbing her thumb nervously over the lid of the container, trying not to stare.</p><p>Agatha’s heart warmed painfully.</p><p>Rio looked exhausted and beautiful in that effortless way only she could pull off. The kind of beautiful Agatha couldn’t quite breathe around.</p><p>And she was here.<br/> For her.</p><p>Dropping off food like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse fluttered, and her cheeks warmed despite her best effort to stay composed. She straightened her glasses and stepped closer, gently interrupting Sharon’s enthusiastic monologue about feline dietary restrictions.</p><p>“Sharon,” she said kindly, “I’m sure that’s fascinating, but Rio’s just gotten off a long shift. I’m afraid I’m stealing her for a moment.”</p><p>Rio let out a tiny, grateful breath.</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss it.<br/> And she didn’t pretend she didn’t enjoy being the one to save her.</p><p>Sharon nodded solemnly. “Of course, yes, yes. Rio dear, come back any time. I have photos of Mr. Whiskerson that you would just love.”</p><p>Rio managed a polite smile that looked like the last flicker of a dying candle. “I… would love that.”</p><p>Sharon finally disappeared inside.</p><p>The moment the door shut, Rio exhaled a long, dramatic breath. “You saved my life.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, pretending she wasn’t beaming inside. “She does that.”</p><p>Rio lifted the container of food. “I brought you and Lilia leftovers. I figured you might not have eaten breakfast yet.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at it, something warm blooming low in her chest. “We have. But I’ll gladly eat again.”</p><p>Rio’s smile grew, shy and radiant all at once. “Good. I made too much.”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer without thinking. “You should go sleep, you look exhausted.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “I will. I just… wanted to see you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>Her fingers brushed Rio’s for the briefest moment as she took the container. “I’m glad you did.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, her exhaustion melting into something sweet. “Text me later?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha swallowed. “I will.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then lifted her hand as if she might touch Agatha’s cheek—then stopped herself. “Okay. I’ll let you go... By the way, the glasses?” Rio made a gesture as if clutching her chest and biting her lip as she smirked walking backwards, causing Agatha to let out a snort, quickly covering her mouth in embarrassment.</p><p>Agatha watched her leave, heart aching in that new, overwhelming way she hadn’t yet learned how to navigate.</p><p>She lingered on the porch for a moment, then returned inside.</p><p>Lilia was waiting with the smuggest smile. “So. She brought you food.”</p><p>Agatha tried to look stern. “Not a word.”</p><p>Lilia sipped her tea. “I didn’t say anything.”</p><p>Agatha set the container down carefully, trying to ignore the way her hands were shaking.</p><p>But Lilia saw everything.</p><p>“Sweetheart,” she said softly, “you’re in deep.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t deny it.</p><p>Because she finally knew it was true.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>Dr. Stephen Strange’s office was too quiet for Agatha’s liking — soft lighting, neatly shelved books, the faint scent of mint tea. Everything was curated for calm.</p><p>She hated it.</p><p>She sat rigidly in the leather chair, legs crossed, arms folded tight across her chest, as if she were preparing to survive a surgical panel, not therapy.</p><p>Strange reviewed her intake form, closed it gently, and looked up.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness. Thank you for coming.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed lightly. “Let’s not pretend this was entirely my idea.”</p><p>“Lilia scheduled it,” Strange said calmly. “But you arrived. That matters.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her chin a fraction, a small defensive gesture she didn’t even realise she made. She hated the implication that her showing up was some sort of fragile victory. “Please don’t try to butter me up.”</p><p>“Not my intention,” Strange replied, voice steady, professional. “Believe it or not, I’m on your side.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer. She wasn’t sure she believed that yet. She wasn’t sure she believed anyone was on her side. She sat very still, spine straight, shoulders squared, trying to look like someone who wasn’t quietly unraveling at the seams.</p><p>Strange folded his hands. “Let’s start with something simple. What brought you here today?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. She looked away, inhaling slowly, trying to gather the pieces of herself into something sharp and unbreakable. Something she could present. Something he couldn’t see through.</p><p>She swallowed. “I had an… unstable moment at work. And I cannot afford for that to happen again.”</p><p>Her voice came out cooler than she intended, but underneath the calm was a tremor she couldn’t quite hide. </p><p>The shame of it sat heavy in her chest.</p><p>Strange nodded as if this were familiar territory. “What kind of unstable moment?”</p><p>“A freeze,” Agatha said curtly. She could still feel the shock of it, the way her hands went useless, the operating room closing in around her. “During a procedure. A child’s procedure.”</p><p>Strange’s eyes softened—not pity, not condescension, just understanding. It unnerved her more than judgment would have.</p><p>She forced herself to continue, though her breath wavered at the edges. “My mind went somewhere it shouldn’t have. It compromised my focus. It compromised the room.”</p><p>“Did anyone get hurt?” Strange asked gently.</p><p>“No.” The word snapped out too fast. Too sharp. Too defensive. “Not this time.”</p><p>Not this time.<br/> The phrase echoed like a bruise.</p><p>Strange steepled his fingers. “But someone did once?”</p><p>Agatha’s throat constricted.</p><p>He didn’t push.<br/> He waited.</p><p>After a long moment, she said quietly, “His name was Nicky.”</p><p>Strange nodded. “Tell me about him.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her hands, fingers clasped tight until her knuckles blanched. She didn’t trust her voice at first. Her pulse thudded in her throat, and for a terrifying second she feared she wouldn’t be able to speak at all.</p><p>But she forced herself to breathe.</p><p>“He was… four,” she began, the number catching in her chest like a thorn. “He had a congenital heart defect. Multiple complications. He spent more time in the hospital than outside it.”</p><p>She felt the ache of those memories sink into her bones — the beeping machines, the small dinosaur pajamas, the stubborn bravery only children seem to possess. Her voice softened without permission.</p><p>“He loved dinosaurs. And stickers. And asking me impossible questions while I sutured.” A fractured laugh escaped her, brittle around the edges. “He was very bad at sitting still.”</p><p>Saying it aloud made the ache sharper. It made him real again, in the kind of way that hurt.</p><p>Strange nodded encouragingly. “Lilia told me only that you lost a patient in Boston. Nothing more.”</p><p>Agatha felt her spine loosen just slightly. “Good.”<br/> She didn’t want Lilia knowing the depth of it.<br/> She didn’t want anyone knowing, but now she was here, speaking about him in a room that suddenly felt too small.</p><p>“Were his parents involved?” Strange asked gently.</p><p>Her expression hardened instantly, cold and precise — the mask she always reached for.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Strange waited, still as stone.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat tight. “They abandoned him. They didn’t want the… burden.” It hurt to say the word. “They left him at the hospital and never looked back.”</p><p>The memory made her chest twist — the day she realised his parents weren’t coming back. The way he asked for them less and less. The way she became the one he looked for in the doorway.</p><p>Strange’s voice was neutral but sincere. “That must have been incredibly difficult to navigate.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small, bitter laugh. “He deserved everything. And he had nothing. No family. No home.” </p><p>Her eyes stung, vision shimmering. “Not even a chance.”</p><p>“You cared for him,” Strange said softly.</p><p>She nodded once, small and desperate. “Yes.”</p><p>“More than a surgeon normally would.”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Her breath stilled.<br/> Her heart lurched painfully once, like a blow.</p><p>Strange’s voice gentled further. “Did you consider caring for him permanently?”</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, the sound almost a gasp. She lowered her gaze, shame and longing mixing in her chest like a bruise.</p><p>“I… did,” she whispered, barely audible.</p><p>A flood of memories crashed over her — looking up adoption protocols in secret, wondering what his room would look like, imagining the sound of him laughing somewhere other than a hospital.</p><p>Strange didn’t react. He simply held the space open for her.</p><p>“I wasn’t supposed to,” Agatha continued, her voice fraying. “It was unprofessional. Complicated. But he was alone. And I—”</p><p>Her voice cracked.</p><p>“I didn’t want him to be alone anymore.”</p><p>Strange’s tone softened into something reverent. “You loved him.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>Just long enough to breathe through the pain.</p><p>“Yes. So much.”</p><p>She blinked again, swallowing a tear before it could fall.</p><p>“He crashed in the OR,” she whispered. “Complications they couldn’t control. They tried everything. But he— he didn’t come back. And I... I wasn’t there.”</p><p>Her breath stuttered out, all jagged edges and guilt. She still felt it — the empty room after they told her, the sterile hallway she couldn’t walk down, the hollow space she never filled.</p><p>Strange’s voice remained steady. “And you’ve been carrying that alone ever since.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, tightly, as if loosening her head even a fraction might make her fall apart.</p><p>“Does anyone else know how deeply this affected you?” Strange asked.</p><p>She hesitated, fighting the instinct to lie, to retreat, to snap her armour closed.</p><p>But a name rose up anyway — warm, steady, impossible to ignore.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Her warmth.<br/> Her steadiness.<br/> Her hands on Agatha’s shoulders when she couldn’t breathe.<br/> Her arms around her when she broke.<br/> Her voice whispering, <em>I’ve got you</em>.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “One person. Maybe.”</p><p>Strange tilted his head. “Someone you trust?”</p><p>A quiet beat.</p><p>Agatha whispered, “I… think so.”</p><p>“Good,” Strange said. “Lean on them. Let them support you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath wavered, her chest tightening in both fear and relief.</p><p>“I don’t like needing anyone,” she muttered, looking away. Needing made you vulnerable. Needing meant someone could disappear. Needing meant pain.</p><p>Strange gave her a small, knowing smile. “That’s why it terrifies you. Not because you’re weak but because you’re human.”</p><p>Agatha blinked rapidly, heat stinging behind her eyes. She refused to let the tears fall.</p><p>Strange observed her posture shift — the way she sat straighter, the way her jaw tightened, the way she forced her breath into a steady rhythm. Always composed. Always in control. Even when unraveling.</p><p>He waited, patient as ever.</p><p>Then, with quiet persistence, he asked, “This person you trust… tell me about them.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>Her fingers flexed in her lap. She never hesitated. She never faltered. She never allowed this kind of vulnerability to show.<br/> But Rio was different.<br/> Rio made her different.</p><p>Strange noticed, of course. “Who are they to you, Agatha?”</p><p>Her eyes lowered, voice soft and unguarded. “Her name is Rio.”</p><p>Strange nodded gently. “Tell me about her.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. She tried to speak clinically, the way she always did when something mattered too much.</p><p>“She’s… a firefighter. Competent. Level-headed. Calm under pressure.”</p><p>Strange hummed. “You respect her professionally.”</p><p>A breath. “Yes.”</p><p>“But that’s not what makes her the person you thought of,” Strange said, quieter now.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze darted away. “…No.”</p><p>Strange leaned back, giving her space. “So what is it about her?”</p><p>Agatha looked toward the window, searching for words in the light filtering through the blinds. The soft glow reminded her faintly of the mornings she’d woken from a rare good sleep — the kind she had recently begun to have after spending time with Rio. Warm. Gentle. Disarming.</p><p>She didn’t even realise her voice softened as she spoke.</p><p>“She’s… warm,” Agatha said quietly. “Not just friendly. Warm in a way that feels… safe.”</p><p>It felt strange admitting that. Stranger that it felt true.</p><p>Strange didn’t interrupt. He let the silence hold space for her.</p><p>Agatha drew in a slow breath, grounding herself. “She listens. Not because she wants something, but because she cares.” Her voice thinned. “She doesn’t push me. She just… stays.”</p><p>Staying wasn’t something Agatha was used to. People either left or were taken. Rio did neither.</p><p>Strange nodded faintly. “And you trust her.”</p><p>The confession burst out of her before she could swallow it back. “…Yes.”</p><p>Her pulse jumped. She hadn’t meant to say that aloud. Trusting someone felt like holding a lit match too close to her palm.</p><p>Strange’s tone gentled. “Has she seen you vulnerable?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.<br/> A memory rose—<br/>Rio’s arms steadying her after the OR incident. </p><p>Agatha trembling despite all her efforts to hide it. </p><p>Rio whispering reassurances, quiet and grounding. </p><p>The warmth of another human being anchoring her instead of her own sheer willpower.</p><p>She swallowed. “Yes.”</p><p>“And how did she respond?” Strange asked.</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, closing her eyes to keep her composure. She remembered the softness in Rio’s touch, the way she had held her carefully, without pity, without judgment.</p><p>“Gently,” she whispered. “She held me. She didn’t make me feel… weak. Or broken. Or ridiculous. Just… grounded.”</p><p>Strange tilted his head. “It sounds like she offers you something you haven’t allowed yourself in a long time.”</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes, voice barely above a breath. “Peace.”</p><p>Strange didn’t change expression, but something softened in his posture — a recognition, a respect.</p><p>“And how do you feel when you’re with her?” he asked quietly.</p><p>Agatha stared at her hands, fingers curling in her lap. Her voice trembled with an honesty she wished she could hold back.</p><p>“Like I can breathe,” she whispered.</p><p>Strange nodded. “Then this person isn’t a crutch, Agatha. She’s a connection. A healthy one.”</p><p>Agatha blinked rapidly, her eyes shining. “I’m not used to needing anyone.”</p><p>“That’s not a flaw,” Strange said gently. “That’s a wound. One that’s healing.”</p><p>Agatha inhaled sharply, the truth of that cutting deep. She didn’t like how vulnerable it made her feel.</p><p>Strange watched her for a moment longer, then said, his tone measured but kind, “It’s natural to be afraid of caring again when you’ve lost someone. And it’s natural to feel anxious when someone you care for has a risky job. But fear is not evidence that something is wrong — only that something matters.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath faltered.<br/> Not because he was wrong.<br/> But because he was right — quietly, disarmingly right.</p><p>“Letting someone in doesn’t guarantee loss,” Strange continued softly. “It just allows you to feel again. And you’re allowed to feel, Agatha.”</p><p>A tear slipped down her cheek. She didn’t stop it this time.</p><p>Strange closed his notebook without looking down. “We can work on the rest. But for now… I’m glad you’re letting someone in.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak.</p><p>But for the first time that session, she didn’t fight the feeling in her chest.</p><p>She let it settle.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The door to Dr. Strange’s office clicked softly shut behind her.</p><p>Agatha stepped into the hallway, breathing in the cool air like she’d just surfaced from deep underwater. </p><p>Her heels clicked down the polished floor, steady at first… then slower. Less sure.</p><p>By the time she reached the parking lot, her composure had begun to crack along the edges.</p><p>Not dramatically.<br/> Not visibly.</p><p>But in the way her fingers trembled when she reached into her pocket.<br/> In the shallow rise of her breath.<br/> In the ache behind her sternum that felt like old wounds shifting.</p><p>She opened her car door and sat in the driver’s seat without turning the engine on.</p><p>She just… sat.</p><p>The session had hollowed her out and filled her all at once — grief, memory, guilt, Strange’s quiet voice telling her she’d never grieved Nicky properly… and the terrifying relief of having spoken his name aloud to someone else.</p><p>Her hands shook once, sharply.</p><p>She swallowed hard.</p><p>And then she reached for her phone.</p><p>Her thumb hovered over Rio’s contact.</p><p>She pressed call.</p><p>Rio answered before the second ring.</p><p>Rio: “Hi, hermosa.”</p><p>The sound of her voice — warm, steady, familiar — made Agatha’s eyes sting.</p><p>She inhaled shakily. “I… I had my therapy session.”</p><p>Rio’s tone softened immediately. “Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha nodded even though Rio couldn’t see her. “I talked about him. More than I meant to.”</p><p>A pause. Not uncomfortable — just giving space.</p><p>Rio: “How do you feel?”</p><p>Agatha let out a trembling breath. “... I don’t know.”</p><p>More silence.<br/> But warm.<br/> Present.</p><p>Then Rio asked, in a voice gentle enough to undo anyone:<br/>“Do you want to be alone right now?”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. “No.”</p><p>Rio’s reply was soft but certain. “Come over. Alice is at Jen’s tonight. It’s quiet.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. She pulled the phone a little closer to her ear.</p><p>“Are you sure?” she whispered.</p><p>Rio: “I want you here.”</p><p>The crack in Agatha’s chest widened — not painful, just honest.</p><p>“Okay,” she breathed. “I’m coming.”</p><p><br/>Agatha drove on autopilot, her mind foggy and overfull.<br/> By the time she reached Rio’s building, the sky had turned soft with evening. She climbed the stairs slowly, feeling every step.</p><p>She lifted her hand to knock.</p><p>She didn’t get the chance.</p><p>Rio opened the door instantly, as if she had been standing just behind it, waiting for the moment Agatha knocked. A wash of warm light spilled out from the apartment — golden lamps, soft shadows, the faint smell of garlic and lingering spices from whatever Rio had cooked earlier. It felt like stepping into a pocket of warmth carved out of the world.</p><p>Rio took one look at her.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t crying. She wasn’t shaking. She looked… composed, but thinner around the edges. Like someone had quietly taken her apart and reassembled her with one piece missing. Unsteady in a way only someone who knew her could see.</p><p>Rio’s expression softened into something warm enough to melt steel.</p><p>“Hey,” she murmured, voice low and gentle, like she was afraid to startle her.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, trying to keep her breath from trembling. “Hi.”</p><p>Rio didn’t drag her into a hug.<br/> She didn’t rush her.<br/> She simply opened her arms — a quiet offer, patient and steady.</p><p>Agatha stepped into them before she even realised she’d moved.</p><p>The embrace closed around her slowly, deliberately. Rio’s arms were strong but careful, like she was afraid she might break something delicate if she held too tightly. One hand slid up to cradle the back of Agatha’s head, her fingers threading into her hair with instinctive tenderness.</p><p>Agatha pressed her forehead to Rio’s shoulder, the fabric of her shirt soft against her skin. The scent of her washed over her — clean laundry, sandalwood, the faint trace of smoke that always clung to her no matter how many times she showered. Warm. Familiar. Grounding.</p><p>Her chest loosened almost painfully.</p><p>Rio didn’t speak.<br/> She didn’t ask questions.<br/> She anchored her with touch alone.</p><p>No words — just safety.</p><p>The apartment around them felt muted. The hum of the refrigerator. The soft tick of the wall clock. A lamp casting warm light across the couch. Plants in the corner. A half-folded blanket draped over the armrest. Home. Not hers, yet somehow… comforting.</p><p>After a long moment, Agatha whispered into Rio’s shoulder, “It was harder than I thought.”</p><p>Rio’s hand stroked gently through her hair, slow and soothing. “Of course it was,” she murmured. “You talked about something that mattered.”</p><p>Agatha shut her eyes. The truth of it stung. “He mattered.”</p><p>Rio pressed a soft kiss to the top of her head, almost instinctive. “I know.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened again. She felt so exposed — and yet so held. “I didn’t expect it to feel like this.”</p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to see her face, her hands still resting warm on Agatha’s arms. “Like what?”</p><p>Agatha looked up into those steady brown eyes, soft and open and impossibly patient. Rio’s presence radiated warmth — not loud, not overwhelming, just a quiet light that made the tightness in Agatha’s chest ease for the first time all day.</p><p>“Like I’m allowed to breathe,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio’s smile was small, devastatingly tender. “You are.”</p><p>She took Agatha’s hand with a gentleness that wasn’t possessive, but invitational, guiding her toward the couch. They sank down together, the cushions dipping beneath their combined weight. Their knees brushed. The room glowed amber around them, soft and safe.</p><p>Rio traced slow circles over the back of Agatha’s hand, a grounding touch that steadied her pulse one heartbeat at a time.</p><p>“Tell me what happened,” she murmured. “Only what you want to.”</p><p>Agatha did.</p><p>Not in order.<br/> Not neatly.<br/> Not the way she usually explains things.</p><p>Just fragments, spoken in pieces — Nicky’s laughter.</p><p>The grief she’d buried under precision and perfectionism. </p><p>Strange’s questions, gentle but cutting, peeling back layers she’d kept sealed for years.<br/>Rio listened.<br/>Every word.</p><p> Every pause.</p><p> Every crack in her voice.</p><p><br/>She didn’t interrupt.</p><p> Didn’t flinch.</p><p> Didn’t look away.</p><p>She simply sat there, thumb moving in those slow, steady circles, holding space for Agatha to unravel and still remain whole.</p><p>When Agatha finally fell silent, her chest felt hollowed and full at the same time — like something had been torn open just enough to start healing.</p><p>Rio reached up and cupped her cheek, the pad of her thumb brushing lightly across her skin. The tenderness of it made Agatha’s breath catch, her body leaning instinctively into the touch she had spent years convincing herself she didn’t need.</p><p>“You didn’t deserve any of that alone,” Rio whispered.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes softened, vulnerability shining through the cracks she could no longer hide. “I’m trying not to be alone anymore.”</p><p>Her voice trembled — not with fear this time, but with the quiet truth of it.</p><p>Rio leaned in until their foreheads touched, her breath warm and steady. “You’re not.”</p><p>The words melted something inside Agatha, slow and impossibly warm.</p><p>“Rio,” she breathed.</p><p>Her own voice startled her — soft, trembling, pulled straight from somewhere deep she hadn’t touched in years. She felt Rio’s breath warm against her cheek, steady and patient, and something inside her chest fluttered painfully, like a door she’d kept locked was cracking open.</p><p>Rio’s eyes opened, dark and patient. “Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head and kissed her.</p><p>Her heart leapt. For a split second she felt weightless — untethered — like the space between wanting and acting had disappeared too suddenly.</p><p>The first touch of their lips was soft, almost hesitant, more question than certainty. Agatha felt her own pulse flicker in her throat, terrified and wanting and overwhelmed.</p><p>Rio answered with a deeper one, warm and sure, and Agatha’s breath collapsed into her chest. She slid her fingers into Rio’s hair, surprised by its softness, by how naturally her hand curved around the back of Rio’s head. She pulled her closer without thinking, her body moving before her mind even caught up.</p><p>Rio’s hand found her waist, warm and solid, guiding her gently until there was no space left between them. Agatha felt the firmness of Rio’s arm, the deliberate steadiness of her touch — not demanding, not claiming, just holding her like she was something precious.</p><p>The kiss deepened, slow and unhurried, the kind that said more than words ever could. Agatha felt heat swell beneath her skin, felt her chest loosen in a way that bordered on dizzying. Her sigh ghosted against Rio’s lips — a small, involuntary sound she hadn’t meant to make — and Rio exhaled sharply at the sound, a quiet shiver running through her.</p><p>They paused only when breath demanded it, foreheads pressed together, lips still brushing, hearts stumbling in the same unsteady rhythm. Agatha’s fingers remained curled in Rio’s hair. She didn’t want to pull away. She didn’t want this to end.</p><p>Rio whispered, “Agatha…”</p><p>The sound of her name in Rio’s voice went straight through her, tightening something low in her stomach. Agatha’s voice came out steady, certain, grounded in a clarity she hadn’t expected. “Stay with me.”</p><p>Rio kissed her again—deep, reverent, full of everything she hadn’t found the words for. Agatha felt herself soften instantly, her hands tightening on Rio’s shoulders. “All night.”</p><p>Agatha pulled her close once more, pressing her face briefly into Rio’s neck, breathing in the warm, faintly smoky scent of her skin. For the first time in years, something inside her was shifting in the right direction. Something heavy loosening, something wounded beginning to trust.</p><p>And in that soft, quiet apartment, with the weight of grief starting to loosen and safety blooming around her, Agatha let herself fall into the one place she finally felt held.</p><p>Rio’s lips were still warm against Agatha’s neck when she pulled back, just enough to look at her.<br/> Breath mingled.<br/> Foreheads touching.<br/> Agatha’s pulse fluttered at the closeness, warmth pooling low in her stomach.<br/> The air felt thick, charged, trembling with something that had been building since the carnival, since the fire station, since that first shy text message under fluorescent hospital lights.</p><p>Rio brushed her thumb along Agatha’s cheek again, and Agatha leaned into it before she could think. The touch was gentle but certain, and it made her chest ache in a way that frightened her with its sweetness.<br/>Rio whispered, voice barely there, “You’re sure?”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, slow and deliberate, her eyes never leaving Rio’s. She felt the yes form long before she said it aloud — soft, steady, real. “Yes.”</p><p>The word settled between them like a spark.</p><p>Rio kissed her again — even deeper this time, heat blooming instantly between their mouths. Agatha let out a soft, involuntary sound, something caught between a sigh and a surrender, and Rio shuddered at the sound, her fingers tightening on the fabric at Agatha’s waist as if she couldn’t help it.</p><p>Agatha tugged gently at the hem of Rio’s shirt, her fingertips skimming warm skin. Rio broke the kiss just long enough to pull it over her head, tossing it aside. Her skin was warm under Agatha’s hands — all soft muscle and gentle strength. Firefighter strength, earned strength. The kind of strength that could lift, hold, carry. The kind of strength that had held her together in the worst moment of her life.</p><p>Agatha traced her fingers along Rio’s shoulders, feeling the smooth heat of her skin, the quiet tension in her muscles, the way her breath hitched and a low sound vibrated in her chest — a sound that went straight through Agatha, tightening every nerve in her body.</p><p>And for a moment, just a moment, Agatha let herself feel everything she’d been too afraid to want.</p><p>Rio slid her hands up Agatha’s sides, under her blouse, fingertips gliding over skin that had rarely known such tenderness. Agatha inhaled sharply at the touch, her head tipping back slightly, exposing the elegant line of her throat.</p><p>Rio kissed her there.</p><p>Slow.<br/> Devoted.<br/> Like she was learning Agatha’s pulse by heart.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curled into Rio’s hair, pulling her closer, her breath catching in little gasps each time Rio’s mouth moved lower, then returned to her lips in a needy, hungry kiss.</p><p>Clothes loosened between kisses.<br/> Buttons undone by unsteady fingers.<br/> The fabric of Agatha’s blouse fell from her shoulders.</p><p>Rio stopped.</p><p>Not in hesitation.<br/> In awe.</p><p>Her eyes swept over Agatha — not hungrily, but reverently, like she was seeing something she’d dreamed of touching and couldn’t believe was real.</p><p>“Beautiful,” Rio whispered, almost to herself.</p><p>Agatha felt the words like heat down her spine.</p><p>Rio kissed her again — slower now, deeper, hands framing Agatha’s face as if she were something precious. Agatha’s body pressed flush against hers, warmth meeting warmth, breath stuttering as Rio’s hands slid over her back, guiding her gently down onto the couch.</p><p>No rush.<br/> No frantic fumbling.<br/> Just two women finally giving in to a pull that had been drawing them together for weeks.</p><p>Rio settled above her, one hand braced beside Agatha’s head, the other smoothing along her waist, her hip, her thigh — mapping her slowly, carefully, like she was following the contours of something sacred.</p><p>Agatha arched into her touch instinctively, her breath breaking on a low, startled moan that Rio swallowed in a kiss so deep it made Agatha’s fingers tremble in her hair.</p><p>Rio murmured against her mouth, breathless, “Tell me if you want me to stop.”</p><p>Agatha’s answer was immediate — a soft, desperate whisper, “Don’t.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth traced a path along her jaw, her throat, her collarbone, while Agatha’s hands roamed over the muscles of Rio’s back, feeling each breath, each shiver, each moment of restraint and desire mingling between them.</p><p>Agatha’s leg slid around Rio’s waist, pulling her closer.</p><p>Rio groaned — a low, raw sound — and kissed her with a heat that made Agatha’s body light up.</p><p>Rio’s mouth was hot against Agatha’s throat, her teeth grazing skin that felt electric beneath her touch. Agatha arched into her, a sound escaping her that she’d never heard herself make before — needy, desperate, utterly undone.</p><p>“Rio,” she gasped, her fingers gripping Rio’s shoulders, pulling her closer. Rio's thigh pressed against Agatha's centre, sending a jolt of sensation throughout both of them.</p><p>Agatha reached for the waistband of Rio’s pants, her own fingers suddenly unsteady. “Off,” she murmured. “All of it. Now.”</p><p>Rio complied with a soft laugh, stepping out of her clothes and reaching for Agatha again. The press of their bare skin was almost too much — too good, too overwhelming. Agatha felt like she was drowning in sensation, in the heat of Rio’s body against hers.</p><p>Rio helped Agatha remove her own slacks, pulling down the smooth material over her long legs agonisingly slow.</p><p>They moved to the bed in a tangle of limbs, Rio pushing Agatha gently onto the soft sheets before following her down. The weight of her was perfect, grounding, exactly what Agatha needed. Rio’s mouth found hers again, kissing her with a hunger that matched Agatha’s own.</p><p>“Touch me,” Agatha pleaded against Rio’s lips. “Please, Rio. I need you.”</p><p>Rio’s hand slid between them, her touch gentle but sure as she palmed Agatha through her underwear. Agatha arched into the contact, a moan slipping out of her. “There,” she gasped. “Oh, God, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s fingers moved in slow, deliberate circles, each movement sending sparks of pleasure through Agatha. “Así, cariño?” she murmured, capturing Agatha’s moans with her mouth.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t form words, could only nod and cling to Rio as she worked a kind of magic with her hands that Agatha had never experienced before. Rio’s touch was reverent, worshipful, as if Agatha were something precious to be cherished.</p><p>When Rio’s fingers finally slipped inside her underwear, Agatha nearly came off the bed. “Fuck,” she breathed, her nails digging into Rio’s back. Rio's fingers circling her clit with just the right amount of pressure. Agatha could feel every nerve in her body react to Rio's touch.</p><p>“More. Please, more.”</p><p>Rio complied, her fingers sliding inside Agatha with a gentleness that belied the intensity of the moment. Agatha tightened around her, her breath hitching with each slow, perfect thrust of Rio’s hand.</p><p>“You’re so wet,” Rio murmured, her lips against Agatha’s ear. “So perfect. God, Agatha, you feel incredible.”</p><p>Agatha’s hips moved with Rio’s hand, desperate for more, for everything Rio was willing to give as her thumb added the slightest pressure on her clit. “I’m close,” she managed to say, her voice trembling. “Rio, I’m—”</p><p>Rio caught her cries with her mouth as Agatha came apart, her body shaking with the force of her orgasm.</p><p><br/> It startled her — the intensity, the sudden vulnerability, the way her body <em>trusted</em> someone else enough to let go like that. It had been years since she’d let anyone see her like this, years since anyone had touched her with such care. </p><p>She wasn’t used to being this open, this unguarded.</p><p>Rio held her through it, steadying her with warm hands and soft kisses, grounding her as her breath hitched and shivered. She didn’t rush Agatha’s trembling, didn’t pull away, didn’t let the moment dissolve into awkwardness or distance. She stayed right there, letting Agatha shake and gasp and come back to herself in her arms.</p><p>Her hand still moved inside Agatha until she begged her to stop, too sensitive to take any more.</p><p>They didn’t separate in the aftermath, their bodies still pressed together, skin to skin. Agatha felt weightless and heavy all at once, boneless against Rio, unable to remember the last time she’d felt this safe. Her legs were tangled with Rio’s, her face buried in the crook of Rio’s neck. She could feel Rio’s heartbeat against her chest — strong, steady, unhurried.</p><p>It anchored her. </p><p>It soothed her. </p><p>It terrified her in a beautiful way.</p><p>She hadn’t realised how much she’d missed being touched like this — not just physically, but with intention, with tenderness. With care. Rio’s warmth seeped into her like something she had been starved for, something she hadn’t let herself want for years.</p><p>The rest of the night unfolded in soft moans and whispered names, in tangled limbs and slow, unhurried exploration, in the kind of closeness that wasn’t about lust alone, but about trust — about choosing to be seen, to be held, to be loved.</p><p>Every time Rio touched her, Agatha felt something old inside her loosen.<br/> Every time Rio kissed her, she felt something bloom.<br/> Every time Rio whispered her name, she felt herself soften in ways she had forgotten were possible.</p><p>They didn’t rush.<br/> They didn’t hide.<br/> They let themselves feel everything.</p><p>And in the quiet between kisses, in Rio’s gentle hands and warm breath, Agatha felt a truth settle low and certain in her chest-<br/>She wasn’t just wanted. </p><p>She was cherished.</p><p> </p><p>The room was dark when Agatha stirred. The soft hum of the air conditioner filled the quiet, joined by the faint glow of a streetlight filtering through the blinds and the warmth of another body pressed along her back.</p><p>For a moment, she didn’t quite remember where she was.</p><p>Then she felt it.</p><p>Rio’s arm.</p><p>Heavy, strong, warm, draped around her waist with the instinctive protectiveness of someone who held without thinking. Rio’s palm rested over Agatha’s stomach, fingers curled loosely, her thumb brushing unconsciously against her skin with every slow breath.</p><p>Agatha went very still.</p><p>Not because she was afraid, but because something inside her reacted like a quiet burst of awe.<br/>She blinked into the dimness, letting her eyes adjust. Rio’s breath was soft against the back of her neck, warm and steady, grounding her in a way nothing else ever had. Agatha shifted a fraction, careful not to wake her. Rio didn’t stir. She only tucked her face closer into Agatha’s shoulder, tightening her hold in her sleep.</p><p>The movement made Agatha’s chest ache with a tenderness she wasn’t prepared for.</p><p>She looked down at the arm wrapped around her, familiar and warm. She traced Rio’s forearm lightly with her fingertips, memorising the shape of it. Muscle under softness. A faint scar on her bicep where Agatha had sutured her months ago. The sight made her breath catch.</p><p>She had never woken like this with anyone. Not this close. Not this held. Not this… safe.</p><p>A quiet exhale slipped from her lips.</p><p>She turned her head just enough to see Rio’s face in profile. Relaxed. Unguarded. Lips parted slightly in sleep. A curl had slipped loose across her cheek, and her usually expressive brow was peaceful and smooth.</p><p>She was beautiful like this. Soft in a way that made Agatha’s heart pull painfully.</p><p>Something shifted inside Agatha at the sight. Not sharp or frightening, but warm and gentle and somehow terrifying. Strange’s words from earlier drifted through her mind- <em>this person isn’t a crutch, she’s a connection.</em></p><p>Agatha thought of the way Rio held her earlier, the way she listened without asking for anything in return, the way she never pushed, only stayed. She thought of Nicky, the grief she had carried alone for years, and how for the first time since losing him she didn’t feel like she had to carry everything by herself.</p><p>Her chest tightened with a truth she didn’t know how to hold.</p><p>She whispered the thought to herself before she could pull it back.</p><p> </p><p>I think I could love her.</p><p> </p><p>The realisation hit her like a jolt. Not soft, not warm, but sharp enough to steal her breath.</p><p>Love.</p><p>The word alone made her pulse stumble. Her chest tightened under Rio’s sleeping arm, and suddenly the dark room didn’t feel peaceful anymore. It felt too open. Too exposed. Her heart began to race, pounding in her ribs.</p><p>Love.</p><p>She had loved before. And she had lost.</p><p>Her mind skipped, jagged and quick, to the tiny hand she had once held in the Boston OR. To Nicky’s frightened eyes. To the way he clung to her coat every time she walked down the paediatric corridor. To the dinosaur stickers he insisted on putting on her ID badge.</p><p>She had loved him.<br/> She hadn’t admitted it then.<br/> She could hardly say it now without choking on the grief.</p><p>And still, she <em>lost</em> him.</p><p>Her breath shallowed, speeding up.</p><p>The room seemed to shrink around her.</p><p>Rio’s arm, warm and steady around her, suddenly felt like a weight she hadn’t earned the right to keep. Her fingers twitched within Rio’s hold, panic rising like a tide.</p><p>What was she doing?</p><p>What was she thinking?</p><p>Rio was a <em>firefighter</em>. A first responder. Someone who ran into danger when everyone else ran out.</p><p>Every siren. </p><p>Every dispatch.</p><p> Every emergency call.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach lurched, a sickening twist deep inside her. She was back in the hallway at Westview in an instant, hearing the overhead call blare through the corridor, the sharp tone of the radio, her body freezing mid-step as those awful words echoed again and again.</p><p><strong><em>Firefighter down</em></strong>.</p><p>Her blood had gone cold in an instant. Her heart had clenched so tightly she thought it might stop. The memory washed over her now with crushing clarity.</p><p>How could she risk loving someone whose life carried that kind of danger?<br/> How could she let herself fall again when she knew exactly how it felt to lose someone she loved?</p><p>The thought made her press a shaking hand over her mouth, trying to muffle the harsh exhale that threatened to wake Rio.</p><p>Her eyes burned.</p><p>She stayed absolutely still against Rio’s chest, but her thoughts spiralled faster with each passing second.</p><p> She couldn’t do this. She couldn’t lose again. She had barely survived it once. She wasn’t strong enough or whole enough to open herself to that kind of vulnerability again.</p><p>Rio deserved someone steadier, someone braver, someone who wouldn’t break at the sound of a siren.<br/>A tear slipped down Agatha’s cheek before she could stop it.</p><p>Rio shifted in her sleep, unaware. Her arm tightened gently around Agatha in a protective hug, her face brushing closer to Agatha’s shoulder as if her body sensed something even in sleep. The warmth of the gesture made Agatha’s chest twist so sharply she almost gasped.</p><p>She closed her eyes and forced her breath to quiet, trying not to wake her, trying not to fall apart in the arms that held her so sweetly. She stayed silent, but inside she was fighting to stay above the rising tide of fear.</p><p>Because the truth was impossible to ignore now.</p><p>She could love Rio.</p><p>The thought was tender and terrifying and painfully real. And loving someone whose world could change with a single call felt like stepping toward a cliff she wasn’t sure she could survive.</p><p>She lay awake for a long time, trembling quietly while Rio held her close, completely unaware of the storm gathering under Agatha’s skin.</p><p>She blinked rapidly, drying her cheeks.</p><p>Then she told herself therapy would be enough. She told herself Dr. Strange could hold what Rio held now. She didn’t need this. She didn’t need her.</p><p>She repeated it because the alternative felt unbearable.</p><p>Agatha slowly began to peel herself away.</p><p>First, Rio’s fingers, slack in sleep around her hip.<br/> Then Rio’s arm, warm and heavy across her waist, which she lifted gently and eased down onto the mattress.</p><p>Rio murmured quietly in her sleep, shifting a little, and Agatha froze. Her breath caught. But Rio didn’t wake.</p><p>Agatha slipped carefully from the bed. She moved with the same silent precision she used in surgery, easing herself out from under Rio’s arm. The floor was cold under her feet, the shock of it grounding her just enough to keep going.</p><p>She gathered her clothes in silence, each movement deliberate and cautious. When she finished dressing, she stood in the doorway and looked back despite herself.</p><p>Rio lay curled in the sheets, peaceful and unaware, one hand reaching faintly toward the place where Agatha had been. Moonlight stretched across her bare shoulder, touching the soft lines of her sleeping face.</p><p>The sight made Agatha’s breath catch painfully.</p><p>She stepped closer without intending to and whispered, barely audible, “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio didn’t stir.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. “This is better,” she whispered to herself, though the words shook. “For both of us.”</p><p>But she didn’t believe it. Not really. </p><p>Fear was simply louder than truth tonight.</p><p>She turned and opened the bedroom door with excruciating care. The living room felt colder than before, the shadows stretched long across the floor. The warmth of earlier had faded from the air.</p><p>She picked up her coat, her bag, her shoes. At the front door, her hand hovered on the knob for a long moment.</p><p>She allowed herself one last look down the hall.</p><p>One last breath.</p><p> </p><p>I can’t love you. </p><p>I can’t lose you.</p><p>I can’t survive that again.</p><p> </p><p>The words stayed inside her, but they echoed like they had been spoken aloud.</p><p>Agatha stepped out into the hallway and pulled the door shut behind her. The quiet click sounded far too loud, too final.</p><p>She walked quickly down the hall, her pulse pounding, then down the stairs, her breath coming quicker as if distance alone might quiet the panic.</p><p>Outside, the night air was sharp and unforgiving. She wrapped her coat tighter around herself, trying to contain the trembling.</p><p>“It’s for the best,” she whispered.</p><p>But each step she took away from Rio felt like tearing out a stitch she hadn’t realised was keeping her together.</p><p>And Agatha Harkness, for all her brilliance, didn’t yet understand that running from this would hurt Rio.</p><p>And that it would hurt her even more.</p><p> </p>

<p>The week that followed blurred into something cold and grey.</p><p>Agatha threw herself into work with the kind of obsessive precision that left no room to breathe. She took extra shifts. Stayed past the end of every one. Reviewed charts until the words bled together. Shadowed other surgeons. Oversaw three appendectomies and a gallbladder removal she didn’t even have to be in the building for.</p><p>She kept moving, kept working, kept doing because the moment she stopped, she felt too much.<br/>Her phone buzzed constantly at first.</p><p>Rio: <em>Are you okay? </em></p><p>Rio: <em>Did I say something wrong?</em></p><p> Rio: <em>Please don’t shut me out.</em></p><p> Rio: <em>Agatha?</em></p><p>Agatha didn’t open a single one.<br/>By the third day, the messages slowed.<br/>By the fourth, they stopped entirely.<br/>Her call log showed fourteen missed calls.</p><p> Then twelve more the next day.</p><p> Then only two. </p><p>Then none.</p><p> </p><p>By day seven, Rio’s number stared from her screen in absolute silence.</p><p>Rio had stopped trying.</p><p>And that, more than anything, made Agatha’s chest constrict so sharply she had to sit down in the on-call room just to breathe.</p><p>She told herself this was safer.<br/> Protected.<br/> Necessary.</p><p>But her hands still shook every time she saw Rio’s name, and she still sturned her phone facedown on her desk like it was too bright to look at.</p><p>At home, she was barely there.</p><p>Lilia watched her with quiet worry. Agatha pretended not to see it.</p><p>“You’re never home anymore,” Lilia said softly one morning, still in her robe as Agatha grabbed her coat before the sun was fully up. “You’re working yourself into the ground.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha replied, too quickly.</p><p>“You’re not,” Lilia said gently. “Agatha, sweetheart… what happened?”</p><p>Agatha froze in the doorway, the question hitting exactly where she was weakest. Her throat tightened. Her skin felt too small for her body.</p><p>“I don’t want to talk about it,” she said, voice clipped.</p><p>“You haven’t spoken two full sentences to me in days,” Lilia continued, stepping closer. “You’re shutting me out. You’re shutting everyone out.”</p><p>Agatha straightened her coat collar. “I said I don’t want to talk about it.”</p><p>Lilia exhaled, almost flinching at how empty Agatha’s eyes looked. “Have you at least talked to Rio?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “Don’t.”</p><p>That was the end of that conversation.</p><p>Lilia didn’t push again.<br/> But she watched her.<br/> And Agatha felt every inch of that gaze like pressure on a cracked rib.</p><p>She went to Dr. Strange every two or three days.</p><p>She sat in his office with her arms folded tightly, spine rigid, answering his questions with clipped precision.</p><p>Strange would ask how she felt.</p><p>She would say, “Fine.”</p><p>He would say, “You’re not fine.”</p><p>She would stare at the floor until her eyes burned.</p><p>He was patient.<br/> Too patient.<br/> The kind of patient that made Agatha want to scream because it felt too much like the patience Rio had shown her.</p><p>Strange asked once, “Have you reached out to the person who made you feel safe?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath snagged.<br/> Her eyes flinched away.<br/> She shook her head.</p><p>He studied her carefully. “And does keeping your distance feel safer than admitting you care?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>She didn’t have to — he could read the war in her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>At the hospital, people noticed.</p><p>Billy mentioned once, “You know, you’re here so much I’m pretty sure you live in the on-call room.”</p><p>Agatha had simply stared at him until he backed away.</p><p>Wanda tried checking in during a shift change. “You look exhausted. You sleeping at all?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha said again, too sharp.</p><p>Jen raised an eyebrow at her in passing. “You’re pushing yourself too hard, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t slow down.<br/> She didn’t even pretend to.</p><p>She just kept burying herself deeper in work, letting the hospital swallow her whole.</p><p>Because it was easier to face complications in the OR than to face the empty space beside her in bed.<br/> Easier to scrub in than to confront the echo of Rio’s voice in her head.<br/> Easier to talk to Dr. Strange about grief than to admit she had created a new one herself.</p><p>After a particularly slow morning, EMTs rolled in a stretcher, voices clipped and efficient, and leading the handover was Alice.</p><p>Hair pulled back, uniform rumpled from a long shift, latex gloves snapped high on her wrists. She moved with the same calm competence Agatha had always admired. But the moment her eyes landed on Agatha, something tightened in her expression.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness,” Alice said, voice steady but cool.</p><p>Agatha nodded once. “What do we have?”</p><p>Alice gave a brisk report as they walked. “Fifty two year old male. Chest pain radiating to left arm, diaphoretic, pale. BP ninety over sixty. Possible MI.”</p><p>Agatha was already pulling on gloves, mind sharpening. “Get him on leads. Prepare for asrpirin and nitro. Page cardiology.”</p><p>They worked in sync without speaking.<br/> Alice handed over vitals.<br/> Agatha issued orders.<br/> The room hummed.</p><p>When the patient was stabilised and transferred to cardiology, Agatha pulled off her gloves and turned to step away—<br/>“Aga— Dr. Harkness. Wait.”</p><p>Alice’s voice stopped her cold.</p><p>Agatha froze, her spine stiffening. “Yes?”</p><p>Alice stepped closer, lowering her voice, careful to keep it between them. Her eyes searched Agatha’s face — not unkind, but unflinchingly direct.</p><p>“I’m going to be honest with you,” Alice said quietly. “You look awful.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched. “Well thanks, I’ve been working.”</p><p>“You’ve been hiding.” Alice folded her arms. “And Rio’s been… a mess.”</p><p>The words hit Agatha so hard she felt her balance shift.</p><p>“Alice,” she warned.</p><p>“No,” Alice said softly, shaking her head. “I’m not trying to pry. I don’t even know what happened. Rio won’t tell me.” She exhaled, the worry in her expression unmistakable. “All I know is she’s barely sleeping. She’s quieter. She’s… hurting.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched despite her best efforts to keep her face composed.</p><p>Alice softened, her tone losing its edge. “And you’re walking around here like a ghost. So whatever happened between you two? I hope you talk about it. Because this—” she gestured gently between them “—is clearly making you both miserable.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, vision blurring for a heartbeat. She kept her eyes on the chart in her hand, pretending the words didn’t land exactly where her chest already ached.</p><p>“Alice,” she said quietly, “I can’t—”</p><p>Alice held up a hand. “I’m not asking for details. I’m not choosing sides. I just… care about both of you. And it’s obvious this isn’t good for either of you.”</p><p>Agatha felt something crack — not open, but inward, a collapsing feeling she couldn’t breathe around.</p><p>Alice hesitated, then added gently, “You didn’t lose her on purpose. I get that. But maybe don’t pretend you don’t miss her. I can see it. Everyone can.”</p><p>Agatha forced her throat to work. “I have to get back to work.”</p><p>“I know,” Alice said, stepping back. “Just… think about what I said.”</p><p>Agatha turned, trying to walk steadily back toward the nurses’ station.</p><p>But her eyes burned.<br/> Her heart pounded.<br/> And for the first time all week, she felt the truth clawing up her throat like it wanted out.</p><p>She missed Rio.<br/> Every day.</p><p> Every night. </p><p>Every silence.</p><p>And pretending she didn’t wasn’t saving her.</p><p>It was breaking her.</p><p>Agatha didn’t remember walking to the on-call room.<br/> Her legs carried her there on instinct, the same way they did after difficult surgeries or panic attacks she refused to acknowledge.<br/> She shut the door behind her quietly, the soft click echoing much too loudly in the empty space.</p><p>The room was dim, lit only by a single fluorescent panel humming overhead. The cot in the corner was still rumpled from whoever slept there last. Someone had left a half-finished bottle of water on the desk. </p><p>The air felt stale. Claustrophobic.</p><p>Agatha leaned against the wall and closed her eyes.</p><p>Alice’s words replayed in her head like a heartbeat she could not escape.</p><p><em>Rio’s been a mess.</em><br/><em> You’re miserable too.</em><br/><em> This isn’t good for either of you.</em></p><p>Agatha pressed her fingers into her temples, forcing her breath steady.</p><p>It was for the best.<br/> She had to believe that. </p><p>She had to.</p><p>She walked toward the cot and sat down slowly, elbows on her knees, her hands clasped so tightly her knuckles ached. Her pulse raced in her throat.</p><p><em>Rio will be fine.</em></p><p><br/> Rio was strong. Resilient. Surrounded by people who loved her.<br/> Alice. The station crew. The community. Everyone adored her.</p><p>She didn’t need Agatha.</p><p>She would get over this quickly — she would.<br/> Rio was warm and good and brave. People gravitated toward her.</p><p>She deserved someone who didn’t flinch at sirens or freeze at the word<em> love</em>. Someone who wasn’t held together with old grief and freshly opened wounds.</p><p>Someone who didn’t run.</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily and pressed her palms into her eyes until stars burst behind them.</p><p>She told herself she was protecting Rio.<br/> Protecting both of them.</p><p>If she pulled away now — before she fell any further, before Rio saw the full extent of the cracks inside her, before the love blooming so painfully in her chest became something undeniable — maybe she could spare them both the inevitable loss.</p><p>Maybe she could save Rio from the parts of her that were still broken.</p><p>Maybe she could save herself from breaking again.</p><p>Her voice wavered into the quiet, barely audible.<br/> “It’s better this way.”</p><p>She said it again, firmer.<br/> “It’s for the best.”</p><p>But the words rang hollow.<br/> So hollow they echoed.</p><p>Agatha folded forward, her hands sliding into her hair, tugging slightly as if pain could anchor her. Her breath shook. She felt the pressure in her chest build and build until it hurt to inhale.</p><p>She tried to picture Rio moving on — smiling, laughing at the station, teasing Tony or Bucky, cooking for her crew, being soft with someone new someday.</p><p>The thought tore through her like something sharp and merciless.</p><p><em>She’ll be fine without me. </em></p><p><em>She will. </em></p><p>Agatha swallowed painfully.</p><p>But <em>she</em> wasn’t fine without Rio.</p><p>Every night she lay awake, reaching instinctively for warmth that wasn’t there.<br/> Every morning she woke aching, the bed cold and too big.<br/> Every shift she expected Rio to walk through the ER doors and flash that shy, crooked grin.</p><p>Every silence hurt.</p><p>Agatha pressed both hands to her face, willing the tears not to fall.</p><p>“Don’t do this,” she whispered to herself. “Don’t fall apart.”</p><p>Her voice cracked.</p><p>Because the truth was so much simpler, so much harder.</p><p>She missed Rio.<br/> More than she had any right to.</p><p>And no amount of work or distance or lies whispered into dim on-call rooms could protect her from that.</p><p>Agatha sat there for a long time, trembling quietly, holding herself together with sheer force of will, because if she let herself break, she wasn’t sure she would stop.</p><p>And still, the truth pulsed beneath every breath-<br/>Letting Rio go wasn’t protecting her.</p><p><br/>It was destroying her.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Later as she stood by the nurses’ station, it was too quiet.</p><p>Too full of the kind of silence that let thoughts creep in unnvited—thoughts with warm brown eyes and a voice Agatha kept hearing in empty hallways when she was tired enough.</p><p>She stared at a chart she wasn’t reading.</p><p>Wanda stood beside her with a coffee cup, observing her with that unnervingly perceptive tilt of the head she had perfected.</p><p>Before either could speak—</p><p>A blur of gold shot past the nurses’ station.</p><p>A therapy dog. </p><p>A golden retriever. </p><p>Off leash.</p><p>But Agatha didn’t register “therapy dog.”</p><p> She registered <em>memory</em>.</p><p>She had seen that same dog before—weeks ago.</p><p> On the afternoon Rio had crouched on the children’s ward floor, laughing as a toddler put stickers on her turnout jacket while the dog nudged at her elbow affectionately.</p><p>Her heart lurched.</p><p>“Wanda,” Agatha whispered, eyes wide. “That’s— that’s the dog.”</p><p>Wanda blinked. “A dog, yes.”</p><p>“No. <em>The</em> dog. The one Rio brought during her visit here.”</p><p>Wanda’s eyebrows climbed. “And what are you thinking?”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. “That she might be here.”</p><p>Wanda’s lips twitched. “Ah.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse began to race. She tried to mask it by standing straighter, smoothing her lab coat but her hands were trembling slightly.</p><p><strong>What if Rio was nearby? </strong></p><p><strong>What would she say?</strong></p><p><strong> What would she do?</strong></p><p>Wanda, of course, noticed everything.</p><p>“No reason to panic,” Wanda murmured. “It might just be a random patients dog.”</p><p>But Agatha was already spiralling inward.<br/>Then—<br/>“HEY—STOP—COME BACK—no, not that way, please—SHIT—!”</p><p>A young man in a navy firefighter uniform came skidding around the corner, chasing the retriever like his life depended on it.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Her heart dropped so fast it could’ve hit the floor.</p><p>Not Rio.</p><p>The disappointment was so sharp it caught her off guard.</p><p>Wanda saw <em>all of it</em>. </p><p>The flicker of hope. </p><p>The quick collapse. </p><p>The tight swallow. </p><p>The shift of her shoulders trying to hide the impact.</p><p>She raised a brow in quiet sympathy for the woman holding herself together with sheer willpower.</p><p>The firefighter stumbled to a stop in front of them, panting. “I—I’m—sorry—he got—out of the harness.”</p><p>Wanda hid her smile behind her coffee cup.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms, trying desperately to regain any sense of dignity. “Who are you and why is that animal running loose in my hospital?”</p><p>The firefighter snapped upright. “I—I’m Peter! Parker. Firefighter Parker. New recruit at Station 24!”</p><p>Station 24.</p><p> Rio’s station.</p><p>Agatha’s chest squeezed.</p><p>Peter suddenly noticed her ID badge. His eyes went <em>huge</em>.</p><p>“Oh no,” he whispered. “Oh no, no, no… you’re the Doctor ”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Is that a problem for you?”</p><p>Peter swallowed hard. “Um. Only because—Lieutenant Vidal—I mean, Rio, she’s kind of been…”</p><p>Wanda leaned in, eyes gleaming. “Go on.”</p><p>Peter winced. “Talking about you…A lot.”</p><p>Agatha went very still.</p><p>“I mean not like <em>a lot a lot</em>,” Peter rushed, panicked, “but Tony was making fun of her because she—uh—really respects you and—uh—she’s been kinda moping and—OH GOD PLEASE DON’T TELL HER I SAID THAT.”</p><p>Wanda outright snorted into her coffee.</p><p>Agatha’s face heated. “Peter. Enough.”</p><p>“Yes ma’am!”<br/> He scooped up the retriever—who happily licked his face—and sprinted away like he feared for his life.</p><p>When he was gone, Wanda turned to Agatha, arms crossed and smirk firmly in place.</p><p>“You nearly fainted when that dog ran by,” she observed.</p><p>“I did not faint.”</p><p>“I said <em>nearly</em>.”</p><p>Agatha glared at her chart. “You’re imagining things.”</p><p>Wanda sipped her coffee. “And you miss her.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened.</p><p>Her eyes flicked to where the dog had run, then back to the chart she still hadn’t read.</p><p>“I don’t,” she said quietly.</p><p>But Wanda only smiled that soft, knowing smile.</p><p>“Sure, Jan.”</p><p> </p><p><br/>Near the end of her shift, the trauma bay doors swung open just before sunset, EMT radios crackling, nurses sprinting to meet the stretchers.</p><p>Two ambulances arrived at once — the aftermath of a violent MVC.</p><p>Kate Bishop pushed the stretcher carrying a clearly inebriated man toward Agatha, her jaw tight, hair sticking to her forehead from the frantic ride in.</p><p>She caught Agatha’s eye and leaned in close enough that only she could hear.</p><p>“Ralph Bohner, small laceration to the head,” Kate murmured quietly. “He caused the whole crash. Blew a .19 on scene. Total asshole. Cops want to speak to him once you give the all clear. Good luck.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled sharply.</p><p>Perfect.</p><p>“Thanks, Kate,” she said, voice clipped.</p><p>Kate gave a sympathetic wince before peeling off to assist elsewhere.</p><p>Across the bay, nurses rushed the elderly couple—both in genuinely critical condition—to separate trauma rooms. Officers hovered near the doors, getting statements from rattled witnesses.</p><p>Jen powered toward the older woman, voice steady and commanding. Another Doctor took the elderly man. The room thrummed with urgency.</p><p>Agatha turned back to the patient, scanning the chart handed over by Kate-</p><p> Ralph Bohner.</p><p>Mid-forties. Drunk. Smirking. </p><p>Zero remorse.</p><p>Of course <em>he</em> was the one who walked away practically uninjured.</p><p>“Mr. Bohner,” Agatha said briskly, snapping into autopilot professionalism. “Let’s take a look.”</p><p>He grinned sloppily. “Hey, pretty lady. Lucky me getting your hands all over me.”</p><p>“Sit still,” Agatha said without missing a beat. “Your laceration needs cleaning.”</p><p>He winked. “I’m into that.”</p><p>Kate was right, he was a complete asshole.</p><p>Agatha bit back the urge to roll her eyes and began irrigating the wound.</p><p>Behind her, she heard movement — paramedics shifting gear, cops murmuring, the rustle of gurney sheets — and beneath all the chaos, she registered one familiar voice.</p><p>One heartbeat she wished she didn’t still know by instinct.</p><p>Rio was somewhere in the room.</p><p>Her pulse jittered, but she didn’t look.</p><p>She kept her attention on the wound.</p><p>“Hold still,” she said evenly. “You’re making this harder than it needs to be.”</p><p>He snorted. “Honey, I like it when a woman makes it hard.”</p><p>Billy muffled a laugh from across the bay.</p><p>Agatha reached for gauze on the counter behind her.</p><p>And that was when Ralph reached out.</p><p>A hand.</p><p> A full palm.</p><p> Blatantly grabbing her backside.</p><p>Agatha froze, breath catching sharp and fast in her throat.</p><p>Ralph chuckled. “Couldn’t help myself.”</p><p>It happened in less than a second.</p><p>Before Agatha even turned—</p><p>Rio moved.</p><p>She wasn’t just fast — she was <em>feral</em>.</p><p>One second Ralph was grinning.</p><p>The next, Rio had him by the shirt, ripped him forward so fast the bed creaked, and—<br/><strong><em>CRACK</em></strong>.</p><p>Her fist connected with his jaw.</p><p>Ralph flew backward onto the gurney, eyes rolling back, unconscious before his head hit the pillow.</p><p>The entire trauma bay went dead silent.</p><p>Even the monitors blipped quieter.</p><p>Kate froze mid-step, eyes wide.</p><p> Billy whispered, “Holy shit…”</p><p> Jen looked up from her patient and muttered, “Jesus Christ.”</p><p> The officer blinked like someone had just slapped <em>him</em>.</p><p>Rio stood over the bed, chest heaving, jaw tight, hand still curled from the punch.</p><p>Then she lifted her eyes.</p><p>Straight to Agatha.</p><p>Only Agatha.</p><p>Nothing in the world existed for her except the woman standing a few feet away, shaken, violated, and trying desperately not to show it.</p><p>Rio’s voice was low and ragged. “He touched you.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth parted, but she couldn’t speak.</p><p>Rio stepped closer, eyes flicking down Agatha’s body—checking for injury—then back up.</p><p>“You’re not okay,” Rio said quietly.</p><p>It wasn’t a question. </p><p>It wasn’t an accusation. </p><p>It was pain.</p><p> And protectiveness.</p><p> And everything Agatha had run from for a week.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“You’re not,” Rio said again.</p><p>An officer tentatively spoke up. “Lt. Vidal… technically that was assault.”</p><p>Rio didn’t look at him. “Then arrest me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>The officer shook his head quickly. “We’re not arresting you. He assaulted her.”</p><p>“Then we’re done here,” Rio said, still staring only at Agatha.</p><p>The trauma bay was silent again.</p><p>Utterly, painfully silent.</p><p>Rio didn’t move. </p><p>Agatha didn’t move.</p><p>They simply stood there — a few feet apart, but it felt like a chasm.</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell, still tight from adrenaline. Her jaw flexed once. Her eyes… God, her eyes were swimming with something raw.</p><p>Hurt.</p><p> Confusion.</p><p> A plea she wasn’t saying out loud.</p><p>Agatha felt it like a punch to the sternum.</p><p> She opened her mouth.</p><p>Say something. </p><p>Anything. </p><p>Explain. </p><p>Apologise. </p><p>Reach for her.</p><p>Her throat locked.</p><p>Nothing came out.</p><p>She could feel every eye in the room on them, but all she saw was Rio.</p><p> Rio, who looked like she had been drowning for days.</p><p>Rio’s gaze searched hers, desperate for even the smallest anchor — a word, a gesture, a sign that she hadn’t imagined everything between them.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted again…</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>Her tongue felt too heavy.</p><p> Her heart too loud.</p><p> Her fear too sharp.</p><p>Rio’s brows pulled together, the hurt deepening.</p><p> She swallowed hard, looking like someone had slipped a knife under her ribs.</p><p>Then — finally — she broke the stare.</p><p>It was subtle. </p><p>Barely a shift. </p><p>But to Agatha it felt like the ground giving way.</p><p>Rio looked away.</p><p>Her shoulders tensed, chin lifting as if bracing for impact she’d been waiting on all week.</p><p>And without another word, she turned.</p><p>She walked past the officers.</p><p> Past Kate. </p><p>Past Alice calling after her.</p><p> Past Billy, who stood frozen with a chart in his hands.</p><p>She didn’t look back.</p><p>The ER doors opened automatically as she approached, the fluorescent light washing her in pale blue before she disappeared through them.</p><p>They slid shut behind her with a soft hiss.</p><p>And Agatha stood rooted to the spot, breath stuck somewhere high in her chest, the echo of that door closing hitting her harder than any punch Ralph Bohner could have taken.</p><p>Because it sounded final.</p><p>It sounded like she had just lost something she hadn’t even given herself permission to keep.</p><p>And the worst part?</p><p>She had done it to herself.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>Agatha didn’t remember calling the number.</p><p>One moment she was standing in the on-call room, shaking, again, with Rio’s face etched in her memory, broken and morose.</p><p>The next, she was sitting in Dr. Strange’s office again — hours earlier than her usual appointment, the evening sun barely touching the blinds.</p><p>Strange looked up from his desk as she entered.</p><p>She didn’t bother with greetings.</p><p>She stood there—rigid, pale, her hands trembling at her sides—and said in a voice that was far too calm-<br/>“I need help.”</p><p>Strange didn’t blink. “Sit.”</p><p>She sat.</p><p>Her shoulders didn’t relax. Her spine stayed straight as a blade. She clasped her hands so tightly her knuckles went white.</p><p>Strange watched her for a long moment before speaking.</p><p>“What happened?”</p><p>Agatha stared ahead, not at him, not at anything. “I saw her today.”</p><p>Strange didn’t need clarification. “Rio.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, breath catching. “She was here. On a trauma call. She… intervened. And she—”</p><p>Her voice broke and she looked away sharply, as if humiliation alone could kill her.</p><p>Strange leaned back in his chair, expression neutral but attentive. “Agatha, slow down.”</p><p>“I can’t,” she said, too quickly. “If I slow down I will fall apart.”</p><p>Strange folded his hands on his knee. “Then fall apart. That’s why you’re here.”</p><p>She shot him a glare—defensive, brittle. “I don’t have time for that. I have a job. Responsibilities. I can’t just—”</p><p>“Break?” Strange offered.</p><p>“Yes,” she snapped.</p><p>Strange nodded. “And what did you do instead?”</p><p>Agatha stiffened. “I left.”</p><p>“Left her?”</p><p>Her eyes flashed. “Stop saying her name like—like—”</p><p>“Like she matters?” Strange countered.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>The room went quiet.</p><p>Strange lowered his voice. “Start from the beginning.”</p><p>She didn’t want to.</p><p>But something cracked.</p><p> She exhaled, slow and uneven.</p><p>“She was in the ER today,” she said quietly.</p><p>“Assisting a trauma case. The… the drunk driver grabbed me. Rio saw. She…” Her throat tightened. “She hit him.”</p><p>Strange raised an eyebrow but didn’t comment on the punch. “How did you feel when you saw her?”</p><p>Agatha laughed—a single, hollow sound. “Like someone had pulled all the air out of the room.”</p><p>Strange nodded. “Because you miss her.”</p><p>Her jaw tightened.</p><p>Strange was relentless. “You miss her, Agatha. You miss her terribly.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes burned. “I shouldn’t.”</p><p>“Why?” Strange asked softly.</p><p>“Because I left,” she whispered. “I ran. I abandoned her. I hurt her.”</p><p>“Why did you run?”</p><p>Agatha pressed a shaking hand to her mouth.</p><p>“Because I’m falling in love with her.”</p><p>The confession slipped out like a wound tearing open.</p><p>She blinked rapidly, ashamed of the tears collecting in her eyes.</p><p>Strange let the silence hold for a moment before speaking.</p><p>“And love scares you.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice trembled. “It destroys me.”</p><p>Strange’s expression softened—just barely.</p><p>“Love didn’t destroy you, Agatha. Loss did. Trauma did. And now you’re punishing yourself for wanting connection again.”</p><p>Agatha stared at him, breath shaking. “I thought staying away was protecting her.”</p><p>Strange raised an eyebrow. “Is she safer without you?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth—then closed it.</p><p>“Is she safer?” he repeated.</p><p>Agatha tried again. “She’s… she’s strong. She has people. She’ll be fine.”</p><p>“Is that why you’re avoiding her?” Strange asked. “Or is it because you’re terrified she won’t be fine?”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Because that was the truth.</p><p>She whispered, “I don’t want to lose her. And I don’t think I could… survive that.”</p><p>Strange nodded once. “There it is.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes filled completely this time.</p><p>Strange leaned forward, voice steady but piercing.</p><p>“Agatha, you are grieving a child. And now you are afraid to love anyone who could hurt you by leaving—through death, through danger, through rejection. You are letting fear decide for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath broke. “I thought I was protecting her.”</p><p>Strange shook his head. “No. You were protecting yourself.”</p><p>The words hit her with brutal clarity.<br/> She flinched.</p><p>Strange continued, unyielding. “Avoidance doesn’t stop pain, Agatha. It only delays it. You are hurting her. And you are hurting yourself. And for what?”</p><p>Agatha whispered, “To feel safe.”</p><p>“Does this feel safe?” Strange asked.</p><p>Her chin wobbled. “No.”</p><p>“Are you happier now than you were when she held you after your panic attack?”</p><p>“No,” she whispered.</p><p>“Do you sleep better without her?”</p><p>“…no.”</p><p>“Does the world feel steadier without her presence?”</p><p>A tear slipped down her cheek.</p><p>“No.”</p><p>Strange softened, just slightly. “Then tell me, Agatha—why are you running?”</p><p>Agatha wiped her face with shaking fingers. “Because I don’t know how to be loved without losing someone.”</p><p>Strange nodded. “Then learn. With her. Don’t throw away something real because of ghosts.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>Strange sat back, letting the words settle.</p><p>“You still have time to fix this,” he said quietly. “But not forever. Fear may convince you you’re doing the right thing. But it will cost you everything you want.”</p><p>Agatha stared at the floor.</p><p>“And, Agatha?” he added.</p><p>She looked up.</p><p>“Go talk to her.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered.</p><p>She nodded once—barely.</p><p>Her session ended.</p><p>When she stepped out of the office, the air felt too cold. The hallway too quiet. Her pulse too loud.</p><p>But one truth finally settled beneath her ribs-</p><p><em>She didn’t want to run anymore</em>.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The fire station sat in the early evening haze, its red doors catching the fading sunlight.</p><p>Agatha stood on the curb across the street for almost a full minute before she could make her legs move.</p><p>She felt exposed.<br/> Out of place.<br/> Too vulnerable in her black coat and hospital scrubs.</p><p>Strange’s voice echoed in her mind-<br/>“Go talk to her.”<br/>So she crossed the street.</p><p>Every step felt like walking through water.</p><p>She reached the station bay door just as it rolled open with a grinding mechanical groan. A blast of warm air and the smell of diesel washed over her. Crew members filtered in and out of her view — Tony pulling on his bunker pants, Bucky checking a hose line, Peter tightening his helmet strap.</p><p>The alarm had gone off moments before she arrived.</p><p>A call.</p><p>Bucky glanced up and spotted her first.</p><p> His eyes widened in surprise but softened with sympathy.</p><p>“Doc,” he murmured, stepping aside so she could see past him. “You picked a hell of a moment.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>Rio stood near the engine, half-dressed in her turnout gear.</p><p> Her jacket hung open. </p><p>Her face was tense and focused, curls shoved under her helmet. </p><p>She looked exhausted — but still heartbreakingly beautiful.</p><p>Agatha took a step forward.</p><p>Rio didn’t see her at first.</p><p>“Vidal!” Tony called. “You good on your tank?”</p><p>Rio grunted in acknowledgement, adjusting her air pack.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, throat tight.</p><p>Another step.</p><p>Then Rio turned.</p><p>Her whole body stilled.</p><p>They stared at each other — two people who had been pulled apart and snapped back into the same orbit too fast.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered with confusion, pain, hope… then carefully shuttered again.</p><p>Agatha felt it like physically being pushed back.</p><p>“Rio,” she managed, voice breaking on the name.</p><p>Rio didn’t move toward her, but she didn’t look away either.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, heart hammering. “I—I’m sorry.” Her voice shook. “I didn’t… I shouldn’t have disappeared. I was scared and I—”</p><p>Rio’s expression wavered for a split second, something like hurt cracking through her.</p><p>But before either of them could say another word—<br/>The alarm blared again.<br/> Louder.</p><p> Urgent.</p><p><br/>Dispatch crackled through the station speakers-<br/><strong>“All units, respond to reported factory fire. Multiple possible victims trapped. Heavy smoke. Potential structural collapse.”</strong></p><p>The room exploded into motion.</p><p>Bucky shoved his helmet on.<br/> Tony leapt into the truck.<br/> Steve shouted orders.</p><p>Rio took one step back toward the engine — instinct, training.</p><p>Agatha reached for her before she could stop herself. “Rio—wait.”</p><p>Rio’s chest rose sharply. She looked torn between duty and heartbreak.</p><p>Agatha whispered, “I’m sorry. I was wrong. I should’ve talked to you. I—” her voice cracked, “—I didn’t leave because I didn’t care. I left because it terrified me how much I do.”</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Something in her expression softened — only slightly, but Agatha felt it.</p><p>“Rio, I…I-“</p><p>Then Agatha’s phone rang.</p><p>Loud. </p><p>Shrill.</p><p> Invasive.</p><p><br/>She flinched and pulled it out with shaking fingers.<br/><strong>WESTVIEW GENERAL — PRIORITY CALL.</strong></p><p>Her stomach dropped.</p><p>She answered. “Harkness.”</p><p>“Dr. Harkness,” a nurse said breathlessly. “We’re getting multiple incoming from the factory fire. At least four confirmed victims with smoke inhalation and burns. We need you here now.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped up to Rio.</p><p>Rio heard every word.</p><p>They stood there, both called into danger in different uniforms.</p><p>The fire engine roared to life behind Rio.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened painfully. “I have to go.”</p><p>Rio nodded once, slow, her face unreadable. “I know.”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer. “When you get back—”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. “We’ll talk… after this. I promise.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest twisted.</p><p>She wanted to say more.</p><p>She wanted to grab Rio’s face and make her understand everything she had wanted to say for a week.</p><p> She wanted to tell her she didn’t want to run anymore.</p><p>That she was <em>in love with her</em>.</p><p>But Rio was already backing toward the truck, climbing into her seat, mask hanging around her neck.</p><p>Bucky slammed the door beside her.</p><p> Tony leaned out the window and shouted, “Watch your toes, Doc!”</p><p>Agatha stepped out of the bay just as the sirens ignited.</p><p>Rio’s eyes locked onto hers through the windshield.</p><p>One last look.</p><p>A promise. </p><p>A plea.</p><p> A heartbreak.</p><p>Then the truck peeled out of the station, lights blazing, sirens screaming into the night.</p><p>Agatha stood alone on the pavement, phone still clutched in her hand, heart pounding like it wanted to chase after the engine.</p><p>Then she turned and ran to her car— toward the hospital.</p><p>Toward the fire’s aftermath. Toward her own reckoning.<br/>Toward Rio, whether either of them knew it or not.</p>

<p>Agatha drove with one hand tight on the wheel, the other tapping anxiously against her thigh. The road blurred past in clean, dark lines, and she forced herself not to look at the clock again.</p><p>Ten minutes to the hospital.<br/>
 Maybe less if she didn’t stop overthinking.</p><p>The encounter at the station replayed in her mind in pieces — Rio turning, Rio’s eyes going wide, the way her face softened and hardened all at once. The way Agatha’s own voice cracked when she tried to speak.</p><p>She finally said something.<br/>
 Not enough, but something.</p><p>And Rio had listened.</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily, her pulse still unsteady.</p><p>She cursed herself under her breath, fingers tightening. “A week, Agatha. You avoided her for an entire week like a coward.”</p><p>She could still see the hurt in Rio’s face when she couldn’t finish her apology.</p><p>She hated that she put it there.<br/>
 Hated that Rio walked away thinking she didn’t care.</p><p>Rio deserved better than the emotional brick wall Agatha had become.</p><p>The fire truck roaring out moments later… that had only twisted the knife a little deeper.</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “She’s fine,” she muttered. “She’s been on dozens of calls worse than this.”</p><p>She wasn’t panicking — not really.</p><p> It was more like a small, persistent tightness in her chest she wished she could ignore. A quiet awareness that Rio was heading toward flames and smoke and collapsing ceilings while Agatha drove toward fluorescent lights and sterile hallways.</p><p>A normal night for both of them.<br/>
 Just… harder when she’d finally opened her mouth.</p><p>“Of all the timing,” she muttered.</p><p>Still, Rio’s last look — the softness in it, the confusion, the unspoken <em>we’re not finished</em> — settled somewhere warm beneath her ribs.</p><p>Tonight wasn’t the end.<br/>
 Not if she could help it.</p><p>The hospital came into view, its bright white lights stark against the early dusk. Ambulances were already backed up at the bay, EMTs moving briskly through the sliding doors.</p><p>Agatha parked crookedly, barely noticing.</p><p>She stepped out of the car, pulling her coat tight around her. The cold air hit her cheeks and cleared her head more than she expected.</p><p>She took one steadying breath.</p><p>Work first.<br/>
 Patients first.<br/>
 Her mess of a heart after.</p><p>But even as she walked toward the ER doors, one thought pulsed quietly beneath everything else:<br/>
When this is over… she has to try again. She owed Rio that much.</p><p>The ER felt like the air before a thunderclap.</p><p>Still, tense, humming with the static of anticipation.</p><p>Staff moved with quick, purposeful steps — clearing spaces, prepping bays, rolling equipment into position. The harsh fluorescent lights buzzed with an edge that made every shadow feel sharper.</p><p>Agatha walked in and immediately sensed it- The whole department was holding its breath.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness,” a nurse called from across the floor, “Trauma two and three are clear. Four’s almost done.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, already pulling on gloves, trying to let the familiar motion steady her pulse.</p><p>Wanda appeared at her elbow, soft-voiced but observant as ever. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. “Fine.”</p><p>Wanda made a quiet sound that translated to<em> I don’t believe you for a second,</em> but she didn’t push. She simply handed her another pair of gloves.</p><p>Before Agatha could retreat into her professional shell, the double doors opened again and in strode Chief Romanoff — Natasha, immaculate as always despite being on hour fourteen of her shift. She scanned the room like she was charting a battlefield.</p><p>“Status?” she asked.</p><p>“Preparing all available trauma bays,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Natasha nodded, then added quietly, “Okay people, brace yourselves. We have three critical en route. Two more likely. FD says the smoke is heavy.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach tightened, but she kept her face perfectly smooth. “We’re ready.”</p><p>Natasha’s gaze lingered on her a fraction of a second too long — perceptive, sharp, knowing.</p><p>Agatha pretended not to feel it.</p><p>Across the room, Jen pulled her trauma gown tight, snapping on gloves with practiced efficiency. She wore a focused expression, the kind she only had before major influxes.</p><p>Jen stepped to Agatha’s side. “I’m taking trauma three. If anything needs switching, shout.”</p><p>“Got it,” Agatha said.</p><p>Jen gave her a quick look — searching, a little concerned — but said nothing.</p><p>Yelena hovered beside Wanda, iPad in hand, double-checking the intake board. She bounced on the balls of her feet, antsy in that way she always got when something big was coming.</p><p>“Ambulance bay is cleared,” Wanda announced. “We have stretchers lined up in hall C, extra oxygen tanks loaded, and four nurses from peads on standby. Teen is on his way in.”</p><p>Natasha smirked. “Someone’s been very productive.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. “Someone has to be.”</p><p>Jen snorted beside them. “She means she doesn’t trust any of us to prepare correctly.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t deny it.</p><p>Agatha watched them — her people, her team — all poised, all ready, all waiting for what was about to hit them.</p><p>She felt an ache in her chest that wasn’t entirely related to the incoming disaster.</p><p>These were the people who had held her up without words.<br/>
 The same people who would know something was wrong if she let her mask slip even an inch.</p><p>She forced her shoulders straighter.</p><p>Focus. Work.<br/>
 Later — maybe — she’d have the courage to confront the mess she’d made with Rio.</p><p>Radio static crackled over the nurse’s station, breaking the silence.</p><p>A dispatcher’s voice came through, crisp and urgent:<br/>
“Ambulances en route. First victims arriving in three minutes.”</p><p>Yelena straightened like a soldier.</p><p>Jen exhaled and murmured, “Here we go.”</p><p>Wanda squeezed Agatha’s arm once — a gesture of solidarity, not sympathy.</p><p>Natasha lifted her chin, commanding the room with a single look. “Positions, everyone.”</p><p>Agatha stepped toward trauma bay two, her pulse steady but heavier than usual.</p><p>The calm was over.</p><p> The storm was coming.</p><p>And all she could do now was brace herself, for the patients, for the fire, for the conversation she hoped she might finally have once the smoke cleared.</p><p>The ambulance bay doors slammed open with a metallic bang.</p><p>Kate, Alice and two other paramedics burst inside, pushing two stretchers at a speed that bordered on a run. Both of them were streaked with soot, faces pale under the harsh ER lights. Their uniforms smelled of smoke — sharp, chemical, heavy.</p><p>Agatha snapped immediately into motion.</p><p>“Trauma two!” she called. “Bring that one to two!”</p><p>Kate angled her stretcher left while Alice veered right, bringing a badly burned man toward Jen.</p><p>Alice’s voice cracked slightly as she called out the report.</p><p>“Male, mid-fifties, found near a collapsed section of the south wall—he’s got partial-thickness burns over his arms and chest, possible inhalation injury, BP was tanking in the rig.”</p><p>Jen was already cutting away scorched clothing. “Got it. Trauma three, now!”</p><p>Agatha moved beside Kate, examining her patient—a woman in her thirties, coughing violently, face grey with soot.</p><p>“Severe smoke inhalation,” Kate said quickly, handing Agatha the vitals sheet. “Collapsed before extraction. Rio and Bucky got her out just before the flames rolled over the ceiling.”</p><p>Agatha froze for half a heartbeat at Rio’s name—but only half.</p><p>She pushed air into her lungs and nodded. “Let’s intubate.”</p><p>Kate stayed at her side, assisting without needing direction. But Agatha saw it—the tremble in Kate’s hands, the tightness in her jaw.</p><p>She wasn’t rattled often.</p><p>Yelena rushed to their side with a laryngoscope. “Tubing equipment ready!”</p><p>Behind them, Jen barked orders, Wanda prepped IV fluids, Natasha coordinated from the centre of the room like a general orchestrating a battlefield.</p><p>Everything was moving at high speed.</p><p>But Agatha noticed Alice.</p><p>Alice hovered near Jen, her face pale and eyes glassy, trying not to show how shaken she was. Her hands were steady—but barely.</p><p>Jen spared her a quick glance. “You okay?”</p><p>Alice swallowed. “Eastview dispatched their whole EMT division to assist,” she murmured. “And—” she lowered her voice further, “—Northbridge too. It’s… it’s big, Jen. Bigger than any of us expected.”</p><p>Jen’s jaw tightened. “How many still inside?”</p><p>“We don’t know,” Alice whispered. “But the heat signatures were… bad.”</p><p>Jen placed a steadying hand on Alice’s arm. “Go get water. Then get back on the rigs. We need you.”</p><p>Alice nodded, but her gaze flickered over to Agatha—just for a second—something unspoken passing between them.</p><p>Fear. </p><p>Uncertainty. </p><p>Something else.</p><p>Agatha didn’t let herself think about it.</p><p>She returned to her patient, fingers swift and sure as she stabilised the airway.</p><p>Kate steadied the tubing and whispered under her breath, almost too low to hear-<br/>
“I’ve never seen fire so devastating before.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse stuttered—but her hands never did.</p><p>She finished securing the tube and stepped back. “Ventilation ready.”</p><p>Yelena hooked up the bag valve mask. “Vitals dropping fast.”</p><p>Agatha moved closer, eyes focused, voice crisp. “Push a bolus. Prep for bronchoscopy.”</p><p>Around her, the ER buzzed—stretchers rolling, monitors beeping, staff shouting orders. Another ambulance siren wailed into the bay outside.</p><p>The storm had hit.</p><p>But beneath all the noise, one thought pressed against Agatha’s ribs with quiet, relentless weight-<br/>
<strong>Rio is still in that fire.</strong></p><p>She swallowed hard, pushing the thought away, burying it beneath layers of clinical focus.</p><p>There was work to do. Lives to save.<br/>
And she refused to fall apart now.</p><p>The first two patients weren’t even fully stabilised when the radio blared again from the nurse’s station.</p><p>“Second wave inbound. Multiple criticals. Two with suspected severe burns, one unresponsive. Repeat — one firefighter unresponsive.”</p><p>The ER went still for half a breath.</p><p>A firefighter down.</p><p>Yelena whispered, “Oh no…”</p><p>Natasha straightened, eyes sharpening. “Everyone ready. Trauma one, two, and four cleared and prepped. Move.”</p><p>The ambulance bay doors slammed open again.</p><p>This time, chaos spilled in.</p><p>Three stretchers.<br/>
 All of them bad.</p><p>One patient was barely conscious, skin blistered and peeling in places, coughing up soot. Another had a leg bent unnaturally, a tourniquet high on the thigh, the smell of burnt fabric clinging to him.</p><p>But the third—<br/>
The third made everyone flinch.</p><p>A firefighter.<br/>
 Turnout gear half-melted.<br/>
 Helmet cracked.<br/>
 Mask gone.<br/>
 Breathing weak and erratic.</p><p>Kate and a paramedic Agatha didn’t recognise barrelled the stretcher through the doors.</p><p>“Firefighter—Eastview FD—collapsed during extraction!” Kate shouted. Her voice broke on the last word. “Pulse weak, respirations shallow, possible flashover exposure!”</p><p>Natasha’s voice cut like a knife. “Trauma bay one. Now!”</p><p>Agatha’s heart thudded painfully.<br/>
 Not Rio.<br/>
 Not her crew.</p><p>But still— still— the sight made her blood run cold.</p><p>Yelena rushed to the unconscious firefighter’s side, pulling away charred gear, revealing blistered skin and soot-streaked features.</p><p>Alice hurried behind them from the bay, her eyes wide and glassy. “He went down right before we left. They’re still pulling others out.”</p><p>Others.<br/>
 Still inside.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>Jen moved quickly toward the firefighter, snapping on new gloves. “BP?”</p><p>“Fifty over thirty,” Kate said, voice shaking. “We almost lost him twice in the rig.”</p><p>“Get me fluids and airway support!” Jen barked.</p><p>Agatha turned just in time to see the patient on stretcher two—his burns deep, skin blackened in patches. </p><p>The faint smell of charred flesh hit her nose, and she forced her stomach tight.</p><p>Her patient.</p><p>She moved quickly, sliding into her role with frightening precision.</p><p>“Let’s get him into trauma two,” she said.</p><p>Yelena nodded, voice trembling but focused. “On it.”</p><p>Across the room, the unconscious firefighter began to seize.</p><p>“Seizing! Push benzos!” Jen shouted.</p><p>Alice froze for a half-second—not from lack of training, but fear. Agatha saw it plainly.</p><p>This wasn’t just another call.<br/>
 This was a disaster.</p><p>And it wasn’t ending anytime soon.</p><p>The ER filled with frantic voices:<br/>
“His airway’s closing—get me a scope!” “Pressure’s dropping!” “Move, move—clear the line!” “We need a burn surgeon down here now!”</p><p>Agatha’s patient started to crash too.</p><p>She heard the monitor scream as his oxygen plummeted, and she moved immediately.</p><p>“Intubate him now,” she ordered.</p><p>Her hands didn’t shake.<br/>
 Her voice didn’t falter.<br/>
 She shoved everything—her fear for Rio, her guilt, her longing—deep beneath her professional armour.</p><p>“Yelena, retract—good. Wanda, push another hundred of fluids. Natasha, page the burn unit.”</p><p>Wanda’s voice was steady beside her. “Breath sounds diminished on the left.”</p><p>“Damn it. Prep for needle decompression.”</p><p>Her chest tightened—but not from panic.</p><p><strong>This was her job. </strong></p><p><strong>This she could do.</strong></p><p><strong> Save lives.</strong></p><p><strong> Even if the one she wanted to save wasn’t in front of her.</strong></p><p>From the next trauma bay, Jen’s voice cut through the noise:<br/>
“Code blue!”</p><p>The firefighter.</p><p>The room froze.<br/>
 Terror—real terror—flashed through everyone’s eyes.</p><p>Natasha snapped, “Start compressions now!”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse thudded in her ears, but she forced herself to stay with her patient. She finished the decompression, inserted the tube, confirmed oxygen rising again.</p><p>But her mind—<br/>
Her mind kept flickering to the fire station.<br/>
 To the team still at the fire site.<br/>
 To Rio.</p><p>To the possibility that the next unconscious firefighter through the door could be—</p><p><em>Stop.</em></p><p><em> Focus.</em></p><p>She pushed the fear aside.</p><p>Jen’s voice rose from Trauma One, fierce and urgent. “Come on. Come on. Don’t you dare—”<br/>
There was a crackle from the radio system at the nurse’s station.</p><p>Dispatch:<br/>
“Be advised — Civilians evacuated. Westview crew still inside. Structural integrity unstable. Heavy fire on the south side.”</p><p>The room went dead silent.<br/>
 All eyes flickered toward Agatha.</p><p>But her face stayed perfectly still.</p><p>Her heart didn’t.</p><p>The unconscious Eastview firefighter was still coding when the next ambulance pulled into the bay.</p><p>The lights strobed across the ER entrance, and Agatha felt her pulse spike instantly.<br/>
 </p><p>Another firefighter.</p><p>This one wasn’t Eastview.</p><p>Her stomach flipped.</p><p>The turnout gear was unmistakable.</p><p><strong>WFD Station 24</strong>.</p><p>Wanda saw the shift in Agatha’s posture and moved closer, hovering just enough that she could grab her if her knees gave out.</p><p>Alice burst through the bay doors, helping push the stretcher, hair sticking to her forehead with sweat.</p><p>“Firefighter from Westview!” she shouted. “Severe burns to the shoulder and back, smoke inhalation, partial collapse—lost consciousness in the rig!”</p><p>Agatha’s heart stopped in her throat.</p><p>Not Rio.<br/>
 Please— <em>Not Rio</em>.</p><p>Her eyes darted to the stretcher.</p><p>The gear was smaller. Leaner.<br/>
 A familiar mop of soot-caked brown hair.</p><p>Peter Parker.</p><p>Barely twenty-three.</p><p>Sweet, awkward, eager to impress. The baby of the team.</p><p>Agatha’s knees nearly buckled.</p><p>Wanda stepped closer, shoulder brushing hers in a soft, grounding nudge.</p><p>Peter wheezed, coughing violently as Alice adjusted the oxygen mask.</p><p>“Collapsed beam clipped him,” Alice panted. “Rio and Tony pulled him out before the whole section went down. Tony’s okay. Peter went under—he inhaled a lot before they could drag him out.”</p><p>Not Rio.</p><p>But Peter was still one of theirs.</p><p>Alice flashed Agatha a worried look. “I—I don’t know where Rio is right now. They split the crew.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted as if someone had reached inside and wrung it out.</p><p>She moved on instinct.</p><p>“Trauma four,” she ordered. “Wanda, burn kit. Yelena, call respiratory for CO exposure. Alice, keep the O2 steady.”</p><p>Her voice was sharper than usual, clipped and too fast, but no one questioned her.</p><p>Peter blinked up at her, eyes watery and unfocused.<br/>
 “Doc…?” he rasped. “Didn’t… see it coming.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed his forearm. “You’re okay, Peter. We’ve got you.”</p><p>He coughed, voice shredded. “Rio… she—”</p><p>Agatha’s breath froze.</p><p>Peter wasn’t fully conscious. His eyes weren’t tracking. His voice was drifting.</p><p>But he still managed to get out, voice cracking:<br/>
“They said… can’t find her…”</p><p>The world narrowed to a pinpoint.</p><p>The air left her lungs like she’d been punched.</p><p>Wanda was beside her instantly, stepping into her line of sight like she could shield her from the words themselves.</p><p>“Agatha,” Wanda murmured, steady but firm. “Listen. He’s disoriented. He inhaled a ton of smoke. He doesn’t know what he’s saying.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw clenched, breath shaking.</p><p>“But—he said—”</p><p>“He <em>doesn’t know,</em>” Wanda repeated, eyes anchored to hers. “We don’t know anything yet.”</p><p>Agatha shut her eyes tight for one heartbeat.</p><p>The panic didn’t stop.<br/>
 But it softened enough that she could inhale again.</p><p>Wanda squeezed her wrist gently. “Stay with me, Agatha. You can fall apart later. Right now, he needs you.”</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes and nodded.</p><p>Barely.</p><p>But she nodded.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered. “Okay. Trauma four. Let’s go.”</p><p>Peter’s stretcher was wheeled away, nurses moving quickly, voices blending into a haze of orders and alarms.</p><p>Agatha stood perfectly still for a single, shaking breath.</p><p>Then she straightened her coat, forced her hands steady, and stepped back into the chaos.</p><p>“Back to work,” she murmured.</p><p>Wanda was right beside her. “I’m here.”</p><p>They moved together, bracing for whatever the fire would bring next.</p><p>Agatha had barely finished suturing the last laceration when the ER finally began to slow. The hallways were still crowded, alarms still chiming, but the frantic edge had dulled into a steady controlled chaos.</p><p>Patients were stabilised. Burn sheets in place. Fluids running.<br/>
 Peter was sedated and on oxygen, monitored closely.</p><p>For the first time in hours, Agatha let herself breathe.</p><p>She stepped out of trauma bay four, pressing a hand to her temples. The adrenaline was wearing off. </p><p>Fatigue seeped into her bones.</p><p>Across the hall, Natasha Romanoff was speaking low into a radio, her face strained. She turned away slightly, as if to shield the device from view.</p><p>Agatha caught movement.<br/>
 A flicker of Rio’s name.<br/>
 A tone that wasn’t right.</p><p>Natasha’s posture tightened.</p><p>Agatha froze mid-step.</p><p>“What was that?” she demanded.</p><p>Natasha immediately straightened, angling her body to block the radio. “Agatha—go take a break. You’ve been running nonstop.”</p><p>“Give me the radio.”</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>“Now.”</p><p>Natasha didn’t move. Her jaw flexed. “You don’t want to hear this.”</p><p>A cold ripple crawled down Agatha’s spine.</p><p>“I need to hear it,” she whispered.</p><p>Before Natasha could stop it, the radio hissed sharply, a burst of static followed by a frantic voice:<br/>
“—still searching for station 24 member, female —lost contact—visibility zero—structure unstable—”<br/>
Agatha’s blood went ice-cold.</p><p>Her heartbeat punched against her ribs.</p><p>Female firefighter. </p><p>Station 24.</p><p><strong>Rio</strong>.</p><p>Natasha snatched up the radio, lowering the volume quickly. “Agatha. Stop. You need to breathe.”</p><p>But Agatha couldn’t hear anything anymore. Everything inside her dropped into a sickening freefall.<br/>
The hospital lights blurred.<br/>
All she could see was Rio’s back as she climbed onto the truck hours earlier.<br/>
All she could hear in her head were the words she never said.<br/>
Her coat was in her fists before she realised she’d moved.</p><p>“Agatha!” Natasha called after her. “Stop—Agatha!”</p><p>But she was already running.</p><p>Down the hallway.<br/>
 Past the vending machines.<br/>
 Past the waiting room full of smoke-stained families.</p><p>Her feet barely touched the ground.</p><p>Her mind was a violent storm:<br/>
<em>She’s missing. She’s in there. I pushed her away. I left her alone. God—Rio—</em></p><p>She burst through the sliding ER doors and sprinted into the parking lot, hands shaking so badly she fumbled the keys twice before she hit the ignition.</p><p>The tires screched as she tore out of the lot.</p><p>She didn’t remember the turns she took.</p><p>She didn’t feel the seat beneath her.</p><p>Her entire world narrowed to one desperate, pounding thought-</p><p><strong>I can’t sit here and wait.</strong></p><p><strong> I can’t lose her. </strong></p><p><strong>I can’t—</strong></p><p>Her breath snagged painfully as she drove toward the orange glow blooming in the distant sky — a monstrous plume of smoke rising above the warehouses.</p><p>Sirens wailed in the distance.</p><p>Agatha pushed the accelerator harder.</p><p>She didn’t know what she was going to do when she got there.</p><p>She just knew she had to get to Rio.</p><p>Before it was too late.</p>

<p>The closer Agatha got to the warehouse district, the thicker the smoke became- a dark, choking plume rising into the night sky. The flashing red and blue lights reflected off the wet asphalt as she turned the final corner.</p><p>She slammed her car to a stop.</p><p>And froze.</p><p>The scene was hell.</p><p>Flames licked through broken windows.<br/> Hoses blasted arcs of water into the inferno.<br/> Firefighters moved like shadows against the orange glow.<br/> Police held back civilians and stragglers.</p><p>Agatha shoved her door open and ran.</p><p>Her heart was pounding so violently it hurt.</p><p>She didn’t see the fire.<br/> Didn’t see the bystanders.<br/> Didn’t see the police.</p><p>She saw the crew.</p><p>Rio’s crew.</p><p>Grouped near Engine 4, helmets in their shaking hands, soot streaking down their faces.<br/>And they were terrified.</p><p>Tony was crying openly, shoulders heaving, face smeared with ash.<br/> Bucky had his fists pressed against his forehead, pacing fast, jaw trembling as he muttered fragmented prayers under his breath.</p><p>Captain Rogers normally calm, steady, unshakable was barking orders into the radio, voice hoarse, desperation bleeding through every syllable.<br/> His hands were shaking. He kept trying to to hide them behind his turnout coat.</p><p>This wasn’t routine. This wasn’t manageable.<br/>This was bad.</p><p>Agatha’s lungs clenched. “Where is she?”</p><p>No one heard her.</p><p>She stepped closer, louder this time, voice cracking,<br/>“Where is Rio?!”</p><p>Tony’s head snapped up. His face broke when he saw her — relief and guilt and terror all at once.</p><p>“Doc…” His voice collapsed. “Doc, I—she—”</p><p>He couldn’t say it.<br/> He covered his face with both hands and sobbed.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>She turned to Bucky.</p><p>“What happened?” she demanded, her voice near shaking.</p><p>Bucky swallowed hard, eyes red, his throat bobbing as he tried to speak. “There was a partial collapse on the east side. A wall came down. Tony got out but—” His breath hitched. “She went back for Peter.”</p><p>Agatha’s blood turned to ice.</p><p>“She went back inside?” Her voice was barely a whisper.</p><p>“For the kid,” Bucky choked out. “He was trapped. She… she got him out, but the second beam fell before we could pull her back.”</p><p>Agatha felt her knees weaken. “No… Rio…”</p><p>“They called a MAYDAY,” Bucky continued, wiping his face with a shaky hand. “Then we lost radio contact. No sound. Nothing. She’s in there alone.”</p><p>Agatha pressed a fist to her mouth, nausea rising so fast she thought she might collapse.</p><p>She turned to Steve.</p><p>He was still shouting orders into the radio, voice breaking between commands.</p><p>“Sector 2, sweep again! No one rests until we find her!” His voice cracked. “No one!”</p><p>His grief was palpable — another sign that this wasn’t just a fallen firefighter.</p><p>This was one of their own.</p><p>This was Rio.</p><p>Agatha stumbled a step closer. “Steve—Steve, look at me.”</p><p>He turned, and Agatha had never seen Captain Rogers look like this — devastated, frantic, horrified.</p><p>“Agatha,” he rasped. “We’re trying. I swear to God, we’re trying.”</p><p>She grabbed his coat, her voice trembling, “Tell me she’s alive.”</p><p>Steve’s throat worked, but no words came.</p><p>And that silence was worse than antything.</p><p>Agatha felt the world tilt. Her vision blurred.</p><p>Her voice cracked open-<br/>“Please—someone—tell me she’s alive.”</p><p>Steve reached out instinctively, steadying her before she fell.</p><p>But he still couldn’t answer.</p><p>And the look in his eyes—<br/>The raw ache.<br/> The fear.<br/> The helplessness—<br/>It told her everything.</p><p>Agatha’s breath broke, a small, sharp sound that cut through the chaos around them.</p><p>Her world narrowed until it was just the fire. Just the smoke.<br/> Just the knowledge that Rio was somewhere in there.</p><p>Alone.</p><p>And maybe—</p><p>No.</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t let herself think it.</p><p>She stared at the burning building, tears blurring the flames into streaks of orange and gold.</p><p>She whispered one word into the smoky air, soft, broken, desperate-<br/>“Rio…”</p><p>Agatha barely had time to absorb the sight of the destruction when sirens wailed behind her. An ambulance screeched to a stop beside Engine 4, and Alice and Kate jumped out—still in uniform, still breathless from the call they had just cleared.</p><p>Alice took one look at the burning building, then another at Tony’s destroyed expression, and her face drained of all colour.</p><p>“Did you find her?” Alice gasped, voice already breaking. </p><p>Bucky tried to steady her, but Alice shoved past him, grabbing Steve’s turnout sleeve. “Tell me she’s out. Please—tell me she’s out.”</p><p>Steve didn’t answer fast enough, and panic flooded her eyes. </p><p>Kate stepped in, her voice shaky but grounded. “Alice—hey—focus. We’ll help however we can.”</p><p>But Alice shook her head, tears spilling as she looked back at the flames. “No. I’m not leaving without her. Not again.”</p><p>Kate wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright just as Agatha had arrived minutes earlier—two women completely undone by the same fear.</p><p>Steve finally lowered the radio, jaw tight as steel.</p><p>“We pinpointed her last location,” he said, voice raw. “Sector 3 — east interior.”<br/>The moment he said it, three firefighters stepped forward at once.</p><p>“I’m going.”</p><p> “Let me go.” </p><p>“She’d go for us.”</p><p>But Tony shoved past them.</p><p>“Fuck that,” he snapped. “I was with her. I lost sight of her. I’m going back in.”</p><p>Bucky grabbed his arm. “Tony—”</p><p>“Don’t try to stop me.” Tony’s eyes were fierce, wet, blazing with guilt. “She saved Pete. She saved me. I’m not letting her die in there.”</p><p>Agatha felt her heart slam against her ribs.</p><p>Tony was suiting up fast — gloves snapped on, helmet yanked down, mask clipped, movements jerky with panic.</p><p>Agatha stepped forward without thinking. “Tony—wait—”</p><p>He paused, just for a fraction of a second.</p><p>Agatha grabbed a fistful of his turnout gear, voice shaking so violently she barely recognised it.<br/> “Bring her back,” she whispered. “Don’t you dare come out without her.”</p><p>Tony’s face twisted, grief and determination warring in his eyes. He covered her hand with his.</p><p>“I’ll find her,” he rasped. </p><p>The second he broke away from Agatha, he sprinted through the smoke — disappearing into the broken entryway like a man running into his own grave.</p><p>Agatha stood frozen, breath shaking, watching the dark swallow him.</p><p>Every second he was inside stretched tighter and tighter around her ribs.</p><p>After 5 full minutes of silence Steve barked into the radio, “Engine 4 interior, report! Tony, give me something!”</p><p>Static.</p><p>Then—<br/>A crash somewhere deep inside the building.</p><p>Bucky cursed under his breath. “Come on, Stark. Come on…”</p><p>More static. <br/>“<strong>—copy—SHIT—I’m—coming out—floor’s going—MOVE</strong>!”</p><p>Agatha’s heart lurched.</p><p>Tony burst through the smoke a second later, stumbling, covered in soot, coughing so hard he nearly collapsed. Steve and Bucky caught him under each arm.</p><p>“Did you find her?” Steve shouted.</p><p>Tony shook his head violently, tears cutting through the soot on his cheeks. “No—no sign—the floors gone—I tried—I swear—”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach plummeted.</p><p>Her mind told her to run.</p><p>Run towards where Rio was lying, helpless, alone. </p><p>“She never called back,” Tony rasped. “She never—”</p><p>The building answered for him.</p><p>A deep groan tore through the night — the unmistakable death rattle of a structure about to fail.</p><p>Steve’s eyes snapped up. “Everyone BACK! BACK! MOVE!”</p><p>Agatha didn’t move.</p><p>She stared at the building as if staring hard enough could hold it up, keep it together, force it to return Rio to her.</p><p>But the warehouse didn’t care.</p><p>With a sound like the earth splitting open—<br/><strong>the building collapsed.</strong></p><p>Flames shot upward.<br/> Concrete folded inward.<br/> Metal shrieked as it tore apart.<br/> A wall crumbled in on itself, then another — the whole structure falling like a house of cards.</p><p>A wave of dust and smoke slammed into the ground, knocking Agatha backward onto the asphalt.</p><p>She hit hard but barely felt it.</p><p>Her ears rang.<br/> Her mouth tasted like ash.<br/> Her chest constricted as the cloud swallowed everything.</p><p>When it thinned—<br/>There was no building.</p><p>Just rubble.</p><p>Sparks.</p><p>Fire.</p><p>And silence.</p><p>Souls being broken in real time.</p><p>Alice screamed Rio’s name so loudly it ripped something inside Agatha’s chest.<br/> Kate pulled her into her arms as she sobbed.<br/> Tony collapsed onto his knees, fists slamming on the concrete.<br/> Bucky froze, face twisted, tears streaming down without him noticing.<br/> Steve covered his mouth, shoulders shaking, his entire body trembling with rage and grief.</p><p>And Agatha—<br/>Agatha felt her heart tear apart.</p><p>It was a physical sensation — a ripping, a hollowing, a pain so sharp she couldn’t breathe.</p><p>It was the pain of losing Nicky all over again.</p><p>“No…” she whispered. “No, please, no…”</p><p>Her voice cracked as she clutched her coat, collapsing forward onto her hands.</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>The name fell from her lips like a prayer already grieving its own answer.</p><p>Her world narrowed to the ruins before her.</p><p>She didn’t hear Tony sobbing beside her.<br/> Didn’t hear Steve ordering hose streams to cool the collapse zone.<br/> Didn’t hear Alice crying into Kate’s shoulder or Natasha’s voice yelling from a radio for updates.</p><p>She heard only her heartbeat.</p><p>Slowing.<br/> Breaking.<br/> Screaming inside her chest-<br/><em>I was too late.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center"><br/>↺↺↺↺↺↺↺↺↺↺↺↺↺↺↺↺</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Peter was almost clear of the doorway when Rio shoved him hard toward Tony.</p><p>“Go!” she barked.</p><p>Peter stumbled forward and Tony caught him, yelling her name—<br/>But the sound was drowned out by the shriek of bending metal overhead.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up.</p><p>Too late.</p><p>A massive beam tore free from the ceiling and slammed downward. She jumped back instinctively, boots skidding on fractured concrete—<br/>The floor split beneath her.</p><p>“RIO!” Tony’s scream tore through the smoke.</p><p>She reached for the edge—fingers grazing the surface—<br/>And then everything dropped.</p><p>Rio plunged into darkness.</p><p>The world smashed into her side, the air leaving her lungs in a violent expulsion. Concrete dust exploded around her, and then—<br/>Nothing.</p><p>No sound.<br/> No pain.<br/> No light.</p><p>Just blackness.</p><p>Rio lay crumpled on her side in the collapsed basement, chest barely rising, soot streaked across her face. </p><p>Blood trickled down her hairline and her arm lay twisted under a slab of concrete.</p><p>She didn’t move for what felt like hours. </p><p>After ten minutes of nothingness Rio’s eyes opened, swollen and stinging.<br/> The air tasted like ash and iron.<br/> Her ears rang like static.</p><p>For a moment, she couldn’t tell which way was up.</p><p>Then the pain hit.</p><p>A white-hot blast through her arm.<br/> A deep ache in her ribs.<br/> A pounding throb at her scalp.</p><p>She groaned.</p><p>The sound barely existed.</p><p>“Where…” she rasped, coughing violently.</p><p>Her hand slid across the ground until she found her radio.</p><p>Static crackled weakly, voices broken and frantic.</p><p>“—lost contact—”</p><p> “—possible firefighter down—”</p><p> “—no response from Vidal—”</p><p> “—get her out of there—”</p><p>Her heart lurched.</p><p>They think I'm gone.</p><p>She thumbed the transmit button.</p><p>“This… is Vidal… basement… trapped—need assist—”<br/> Her voice crumpled.<br/> The radio fizzled once.<br/> Then died in her hand.</p><p>Rio’s throat tightened.</p><p>“Shit… no… no…”</p><p>Panic clawed at her ribs but she swallowed it down, forcing breath after breath through tightening lungs.</p><p>Not the first time. </p><p>Not the last.</p><p>Move.</p><p>She braced her boots and shoved against the concrete trapping her arm.</p><p>Pain tore through her shoulder like lightning.<br/>“Fuck,” she hissed, teeth clenched.</p><p>She tried again. </p><p>And again.</p><p> And again.</p><p>The slab shifted—just barely.</p><p>She screamed through gritted teeth, pushing every ounce of strength she had left—<br/>And pulled her arm free.</p><p>The pain was blinding. </p><p>Sickening.</p><p> But she was out.</p><p>She sagged back onto the rubble, shaking.<br/>“Come on, Vidal,” she whispered. “Not today.”</p><p>Then another thought hit her — cutting deeper than the pain.<br/><strong>Agatha. </strong></p><p>Rio closed her eyes briefly, chest heaving.</p><p><em>I promised her.</em></p><p><em> I promised I’d come back.</em></p><p><em> I’m not dying down here. Not before I keep that promise.</em></p><p>She scanned the basement through the haze. A collapsed shelving unit. Broken crates. Fallen ducts. And behind them, an old maintenance door hanging crookedly on its hinges.</p><p>Rio pulled herself to her feet and staggered toward it. The tunnel beyond was narrow and uneven, carved long before the building had been updated. Most of the factory workers probably didn’t even know it existed.</p><p>Rio ran her fingers along the wall to steady herself. Her breath echoed strangely in the enclosed space.</p><p>Pain pulsed down her arm, but she kept going.</p><p>One step. Then another. She refused to stop.</p><p>I am not dying down here.<br/> I am getting out.</p><p>The tunnel stretched on for what felt like forever before it finally sloped upward.</p><p>Rio kept her hand on the rough concrete wall to steady herself, her breaths coming faster now. Smoke seeped through cracks overhead, drifting down in thin grey ribbons.</p><p>Then the entire world shifted.</p><p>A low groan echoed through the earth, deep enough to vibrate in her bones. Dust rained from the ceiling. <br/>The floor trembled beneath her boots.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>“No… no, no—”</p><p>A second rumble hit, louder this time. The sound of metal twisting, concrete splitting, beams snapping apart in a chain reaction of destruction.</p><p>The building was collapsing.</p><p>Rio threw herself against the tunnel wall as the ground shook violently. Chunks of ceiling crashed down behind her, sending a blast of debris forward like a wave. She shielded her head with her arms as dust exploded around her, choking the air and plunging everything into near-darkness.</p><p>The roar was deafening.<br/> A monster made of fire and steel.</p><p>Rio clenched her teeth, refusing to let panic win. She flattened herself to the wall and waited for the shaking to stop, her heart slamming against her ribs.</p><p>It took less than thirty seconds.</p><p>It felt like a lifetime.</p><p>Finally, the vibrations eased. The tunnel settled. Silence returned—heavy and terrible, broken only by the drip of water from somewhere deep in the darkness.</p><p>Rio coughed hard, lungs burning from the dust.</p><p>She knew what that collapse meant.</p><p>Above her… Everything was gone.</p><p>She imagined the structure pancaked into itself. Imagined the smoke rising higher. Imagined her crew staring at the wreckage in horror.</p><p>They'll think I’m dead.</p><p>Her throat tightened painfully.</p><p>Agatha. </p><p>God.</p><p>Rio pushed the thought away and forced her shaking legs to move.</p><p>She had one way out now.</p><p>Light filtered through the slits of a manhole cover ahead, weak and waevering but still there still hope.</p><p>Rio pushed against it. It barely budged at first.</p><p>The manhole cover was rusted into place, stubborn with years of disuse.</p><p>Rio braced both hands against it and pushed again, harder this time. Her shoulder screamed. Her trapped arm throbbed with each movement.</p><p>“Come on,” she muttered through clenched teeth. “Not dying down here. Not after all that.”</p><p>She thought of the promise she’d made to Agatha when they locked eyes before she’d climbed into the truck.</p><p>“<em>We’ll talk after</em>,” she’d said.</p><p>There was no way in hell she was breaking that promise.</p><p>With a final surge of strength, the manhole cover scraped open an inch, then another.</p><p>Cool night air rushed in, filling her lungs. Rio shoved it aside and pulled herself upward, gritting her teeth as her bruised ribs protested.</p><p>She emerged on shaky legs into the open air beside a row of dumpsters at the far edge of the warehouse lot.</p><p>For a moment, she just breathed.</p><p>The fire was still raging, lighting up the sky in violent orange. Engines roared. Water blasted. Voices shouted. </p><p>Her crew was clustered near the collapse zone—despair in their posture, devastation etched into the set of their shoulders.</p><p>They thought she was gone.</p><p>Rio stumbled forward, dusting concrete from her hair, leaving the manhole behind her.</p><p>Tony turned first.</p><p>His entire body jerked like he’d been electrocuted.</p><p>“Holy—” His voice cracked. “R-Rio?!”</p><p>Bucky spun so fast he nearly tripped. Kate dropped her medical gear. Steve’s radio slipped from his hand onto the asphalt.</p><p>They all stared.</p><p>Frozen.</p><p>Disbelieving.</p><p>Rio lifted a hand, managing the smallest, exhausted wave. “Hey.”</p><p>Tony let out a noise halfway between a sob and a laugh. Bucky swore loudly. Kate covered her mouth. </p><p>Steve looked like his knees might give out.</p><p>But Rio wasn’t looking at them.</p><p>Her eyes found the one person she least expected to see here.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>She was standing just past the engines, chest rising too fast, soot on her cheeks like war paint, staring at Rio as if looking at a ghost.</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>Agatha was <em>here</em>.<br/> Agatha had come.</p><p>Rio took one step toward her—<br/>And that was all it took.</p><p>*****************</p><p>Agatha didn’t process the scream first.</p><p>She processed the silence.</p><p>The breathless, impossible silence that fell over the crew.</p><p>Then Tony’s voice broke through, ragged and disbelieving-<br/>“Rio?!”</p><p>Agatha’s heart stopped.</p><p>She whipped around—and the world tilted.</p><p>Rio stood in the lot, battered, limping, covered in ash and dirt and blood. </p><p><br/>Alive. </p><p><br/>Alive.</p><p><br/>For a second Agatha couldn’t breathe.</p><p><br/>No thought. </p><p>No sound. </p><p>Just Rio—alive—and the brutal sound of her own heart crashing against her ribs.</p><p>Her legs moved before her mind caught up.</p><p>She ran.</p><p>Fast. Hard. Desperate.</p><p>Rio barely had time to brace before Agatha collided with her, arms wrapping around her neck, clutching her like she’d break apart if she let go.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha buried her face against her shoulder, shaking uncontrollably.</p><p>“Agatha—” Rio whispered, voice cracking. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Agatha couldn’t speak.</p><p>Her sob tore out of her, raw and muffled against Rio’s soot-covered turnout coat.</p><p>She felt Rio’s arms wrap around her, one slipping around her waist, the other cradling the back of her head, holding her as close as her battered body allowed.</p><p>“I thought—I thought—” Agatha choked, words broken, breath hitching. “God, Rio, I thought you were gone.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio murmured into her hair, her voice shaking. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.</p><p>“You’re alive,” Agatha whispered, pulling back just enough to touch Rio’s face with trembling hands, as if she needed proof. “You’re—you’re really—”</p><p>“I’m here,” Rio breathed, forehead falling gently against hers. “I’m okay.”</p><p>The world around them faded—the shouting, the engines, the fire, the chaos.</p><p>There was only this.</p><p>Only them.</p><p>Agatha’s hands cupped Rio’s cheeks, thumbs brushing the soot and dried blood, and despite everything—despite the wreckage looming behind them—Rio smiled.</p><p>Soft. </p><p>Relieved. </p><p>Devastated.</p><p><br/>Agatha’s breath trembled.</p><p><br/>“You promised we’d talk,” she whispered.</p><p><br/>Rio nodded, eyes shining. “Yeah. And I keep my promises.”</p><p>Behind them, a broken scream ripped across the lot:<br/>“RIO!”</p><p>Alice emerged from the back of the rig.</p><p>She was running full-speed, Kate right behind her. Alice threw her arms around Rio’s side, careful but frantic.</p><p>Rio winced, and Agatha’s doctor brain snapped into action.</p><p>Pain response—<em>moderate to severe.</em> </p><p>Guarding left side—<em>likely ribs, maybe lung.</em> </p><p>Her breathing too shallow—<em>dangerous</em>.</p><p>Alice pulled back, crying. “Don’t ever-ever do that again, do you hear me? I can’t—”</p><p>“I’m okay,” Rio tried.</p><p>“You’re <em>not</em> okay!” Alice sobbed. “Look at you!”</p><p>Kate reached them, wiping tears with the back of a shaking hand. </p><p>“Holy shit, Vidal-- you look like you crawled out of the earth.”</p><p>Rio shrugged weakly. “Not… far off.”</p><p>Agatha touched her forehead gently, feeling for heat and checking for concussion signs. “Rio, look at me.”</p><p>Rio did, breathing unevenly.</p><p>“How long were you trapped?” Agatha asked softly, still assessing. “Did you lose consciousness? Are you nauseous? Dizzy? Any chest tightness? Any—”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened. “Agatha… breathe.”</p><p>Agatha shut her eyes, a shaky exhale leaving her as her lips parted—as if to say more—but Rio swayed.</p><p>Her knees buckled.</p><p>“No—no, no, no—Rio—” Agatha caught her under the arms before she could collapse completely. </p><p>“Damn it—Tony! Bucky—!”</p><p>They rushed forward immediately, grabbing Rio’s weight as Agatha held her upright.</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, exhaustion hitting her like a wave.</p><p>“Sorry… guess adrenaline just ran out,” she whispered.</p><p>They lowered Rio onto the gurney.</p><p>Rio’s hand reached blindly and Agatha grabbed it immediately.</p><p>“Don’t go,” Rio whispered.</p><p>“I’m not leaving you,” Agatha breathed.</p><p>Alice leaned down and pressed a shaking kiss to Rio’s forehead. “You dumb, brave idiot.”</p><p>Kate squeezed her ankle. “We love you asshole. Don’t do that again.”</p><p>Rio blinked up at them all, dazed. “Love you too…”</p><p>But her eyes never left Agatha’s.</p><p>Not for a second.</p><p>As they rolled Rio toward the ambulance, Agatha walked beside her, still scanning—</p><p><em>Breathing stabilising. </em></p><p><em>Colour returning slowly. </em></p><p><em>Consciousness waxing and waning. </em></p><p><em>Pulse rapid but present.</em></p><p>Still alive.<br/>Still here.</p><p>Rio’s fingers tightened weakly around hers.</p><p>Agatha swallowed a sob and squeezed back.</p><p>She was not losing her.<br/> </p><p>Not tonight. </p><p>Not again.</p><p><br/>Not ever.</p><p> </p>

<p>The moment they lifted the gurney into the ambulance, Agatha climbed in after Rio without hesitation. </p><p>Alice slammed the driver’s door and shouted, “Hold on!” before throwing the ambulance into gear.</p><p>Kate stayed in the back with them, hands half-raised like she wanted to help but also knew better than to get between Agatha Harkness and her injured firefighter.</p><p>The doors closed.</p><p>And suddenly the world was nothing but the tight, white box of the ambulance and Rio lying half broken on the stretcher.</p><p>Agatha’s heartbeat pounded so loudly it drowned out the sirens.</p><p>She hovered over Rio, hands trembling but skilled as they moved—checking airway, chest rise, pupils. <br/>Her brain was fighting itself- doctor and terrified lover, both battling for space.</p><p>Her hands cupped Rio’s cheeks first, grounding herself. “Look at me. Can you focus? Are you short of breath? Any chest tightness? Dizzy? Rio, answer me.”</p><p>Rio blinked up at her slowly. “Agatha… I’m fine.”</p><p>Agatha let out something between a sob and a laugh. “You are<em> not</em> fine.”</p><p>Rio smiled weakly. “Okay. I’m… semi fine.”</p><p>Kate winced from the corner. “Yeah, no, she’s not fine.”</p><p>Agatha ignored her, eyes scanning the length of Rio’s body.</p><p>Her gaze landed on the arm Rio was guarding.</p><p>Swollen. Bent wrong. A deep, ugly bruise forming beneath the soot.</p><p>Agatha felt her stomach drop.</p><p>“Rio,” she whispered, voice breaking as she gently lifted the limb, assessing. “Your arm is broken. At least one fracture… maybe two.”</p><p>Rio hissed when she touched a tender spot but forced a smirk anyway. “Had worse.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare sharp enough to cut steel. “And I don’t care. You hear me? I don’t care how many times you’ve walked out of burning buildings or shrugged off injuries. This is <em>my</em> job now.”</p><p>Rio blinked, stunned.</p><p>Agatha’s voice wavered but stayed fierce. “Keeping you alive is my job.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>Her expression softened into something warm and unbearably gentle. “Agatha…”</p><p>But Agatha wasn’t done.</p><p>She checked Rio’s ribs—gently pressing two fingers along the side. Rio gasped, eyes squeezing shut, and Agatha’s heart clenched.</p><p>“Likely fractures,” Agatha murmured, tone sharp with worry. “Eight, maybe nine. Breathing’s shallow. Potential pneumothorax—Alice, step on it!”</p><p>“Already doing 80!” Alice shouted from the front.</p><p>Kate hovered closer, swallowing hard. “Anything you need, Agatha, I can—”</p><p>“Stay by the oxygen,” Agatha said without looking up. “If she declines, I’ll need you.”</p><p>Kate nodded quickly, stepping back again.</p><p>Agatha’s hand slid automatically to Rio’s throat, feeling for pulse. Too fast. Too thready.</p><p>Her voice shook. “Your heart rate’s elevated.”</p><p>Rio gave a cracked smile. “You’re touching me. Hard not to react.”</p><p>Agatha froze for one second—then leaned closer, breath shuddering. “Don’t flirt with me right now, Vidal. I’m hanging on by a thread.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened. “Okay. No flirting. Just… watching.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, brushing soot from Rio’s cheek with her thumb. “I thought I lost you.”</p><p>Rio lifted her uninjured hand, reaching for Agatha’s wrist. Agatha grabbed it immediately, clutching like she’d drown without the contact.</p><p>“You didn’t,” Rio whispered. “I kept thinking about you. That’s what got me out.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered. “Don’t—don’t say that. You’re barely holding on—”</p><p>Rio gave a faint laugh, eyes fluttering. “Hey. Don’t freak out. I promised we’d talk after… remember?”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. “You idiot,” she whispered softly. “You beautiful idiot.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes drifted for a second too long.</p><p>“No—no, stay awake,” Agatha said sharply, leaning closer. “Rio, look at me.”</p><p>Rio blinked back open slowly. “I’m here… just tired.”</p><p>“You can sleep when we’re at the hospital,” Agatha breathed. “Not before.”</p><p>Kate glanced between them, eyes glossy. “We’re almost there.”</p><p>Rio exhaled shakily. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes briefly, tears slipping free. “You had better be.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand faintly. “I'm safe.”</p><p>Alice shouted, “Thirty seconds out!”</p><p>Agatha held Rio’s hand tighter.</p><p>And the ambulance sped through the night—Agatha keeping Rio awake, anchored, alive—until the hospital lights came into view.</p><p>The moment the ambulance doors slammed open, Agatha was already halfway out, glued to Rio’s stretcher as they rushed her into the trauma bay. She didn’t let go of Rio’s hand—not once—not even when the gurney jerked over the threshold.</p><p>Alice hurried to the driver’s side of the rig, panting, hair a chaotic mess.</p><p>Kate hovered near the head of the stretcher, clearly trying to be helpful but unwilling to interfere with Agatha’s frantic fussing.</p><p>Inside, Jen’s head snapped up. The second her eyes landed on Rio- covered in soot, breathing fast, arm bent wrong, her entire posture shifted.</p><p>“Bay Two!” she shouted. “Move!”</p><p>The ER team descended instantly.</p><p>Gloves snapped. </p><p>Suction hissed. </p><p>Monitors chirped.</p><p>Someone cut away the remainder of Rio’s turnout coat with trauma shears.</p><p>Agatha hovered at the bedside, doctor instincts kicking in despite the panic tightening her throat.</p><p><em>Swelling along the ulna. </em></p><p><em>Deformity consistent with a fracture. </em></p><p><em>Left shoulder visibly displaced—an anterior dislocation. </em></p><p><em>Bruising across the ribs. </em></p><p><em>Second-degree burn over the deltoid. </em></p><p><em>Soot irritation around the mouth.</em></p><p>But her heart overrode all of it with a single truth-<br/>She’s alive. She’s talking. She’s here.</p><p>Rio grimaced as Jen palpated her shoulder.</p><p>“Yeah, fuck” Rio hissed through her teeth. “That feels… really not great.”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, her hands trembling but firm. “<em>Jesus</em> Jen, please—careful with her shoulder.”</p><p>Jen shot her a sharp look over her mask.</p><p>“Agatha. Back off. You know you can’t treat her.”</p><p>“I’m not treating,” Agatha muttered. “I’m supervising.”</p><p>Jen raised an eyebrow. “You’re hovering.”</p><p>Agatha ignored her.</p><p>She leaned in, brushing soot from Rio’s forehead with a gentleness she didn’t even recognise in herself. <br/>“I’m right here,” she whispered. “I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Rio gave her a tired, crooked smile. “I know. I can feel you vibrating.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed but didn’t answer.</p><p>Wanda approached, calm and efficient. “Vitals stabilising. Oxygen is helping. We’re sending her for X-rays—forearm and shoulder. CT for safety.”</p><p>Jen nodded. “Order it. Keep her here until transport is ready.”</p><p>Agatha tensed. “How long?”</p><p>“Ten minutes.”</p><p>Ten minutes felt like forever.</p><p>Jen continued her assessment, voice steady. “From what I’m seeing so far—broken forearm, likely ulna. Shoulder’s dislocated. Ribs are bruised, but I don’t hear collapse. Burns are superficial.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled shakily. Her vision blurred with sudden, overwhelming relief.</p><p>Not critical. </p><p>Not dying. </p><p>Not slipping away again.</p><p>Rio caught her hand with her good one. “Hey. Look at me.”</p><p>Agatha forced herself to meet her gaze.</p><p>Rio’s voice softened, barely more than a breath. “You came.”</p><p>The words hit her with a fierce, dizzying ache. Agatha gripped Rio’s fingers tighter, her voice unsteady.</p><p>“I wanted to run into that burning building for you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened—shock, fear, tenderness all flickering together.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her voice cracking. “I know I couldn’t. I know I wasn’t supposed to. But every part of me wanted to go in after you.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand, her body trembling faintly from pain and adrenaline.<br/> Her eyes—normally so steady, so warm—looked softer now, glassy at the edges from everything she’d just survived.</p><p>Agatha whispered against her temple, “I’m not leaving you again.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly, as if absorbing every word, her breath catching just slightly. She shifted her hand in Agatha’s grasp—seeking more contact, more reassurance—and her voice came out small, raw, achingly sincere.</p><p>“Promise?”</p><p>The single word undid something in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>She pulled back just enough to see Rio’s face, thumb brushing gently across the soot on her cheek. “I promise,” she said, steady in a way she hadn’t felt in days. “I’m here. No more running.”</p><p>Rio let out a fragile breath, some of the tension easing from her shoulders.<br/> “Okay,” she whispered, eyes fluttering shut for a moment. “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha pressed a brief, trembling kiss to Rio’s forehead, holding her hand like it was the only thing keeping her anchored.</p><p> </p><p><br/>Rio’s private room was dim when Agatha finally slipped inside.</p><p>She’d needed the time downstairs — checking in on her own patients, handing a case off to Jen, letting her hands stay busy so her heart didn’t crack open entirely. </p><p>But the moment her responsibilities were done, she was moving again, practically sprinting to the surgical wing.</p><p>Rio was propped up slightly in bed, left arm immobilised, shoulder wrapped, oxygen cannula in place. </p><p>Her curls were damp from the wipe down after imaging, soot mostly gone now.</p><p>She looked exhausted.<br/> And alive.</p><p>Wanda stood at the bedside, adjusting the IV pump with gentle efficiency. She glanced over her shoulder the second she sensed Agatha in the doorway.</p><p>“She’s doing good,” Wanda said quietly. “We gave her something for the pain — not strong enough to knock her out, but enough to take the edge off. Ortho wants to see her in the morning.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, unable to speak yet. </p><p>Wanda’s expression softened, slowly walking over and reaching out to squeeze Agatha’s arm once. “She kept asking if you were coming.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched, but Wanda slipped out without another word, pulling the door softly closed behind her.</p><p>Rio blinked toward the sound, her pupils slightly too large, her eyelids fighting gravity. When she recognised the silhouette in the doorway, her whole face fluttered into a sleepy, relieved smile.</p><p>“Agaathaaa…” she murmured, slow and warm.</p><p>Agatha’s heart faltered.</p><p>“You’re awake,” she said gently, stepping closer.</p><p>Rio nodded once, slow and wobbly. “Mmm. Got medicated.”</p><p>“I can see that.”</p><p>Rio’s little laugh was loose, unfocused. “Feel floaty.”</p><p>Agatha eased onto the edge of the bed, hands folded too tightly in her lap. “Does it help?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes drifted shut for a moment. “Yeah… hurts less. It’s… far away.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath of her own. “Good.”</p><p>Rio blinked back open, studying her through a haze that wasn’t strong enough to hide her sincerity. “You weren’t here… before.”</p><p>“X-ray and CT took time.” Agatha swallowed. “I had patients I needed to check on. But I came as soon as I could.”</p><p>Rio nodded, accepting it without hesitation. “I knew you would.”</p><p>The simplicity of that undid her.</p><p>Agatha brushed a curl from Rio’s forehead, fingertips trembling despite her effort to stay calm. Rio leaned into the touch instantly.</p><p>“You scared me,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>Rio’s good hand inched toward hers, searching blindly until Agatha caught it. “Scared myself too… Didn’t wanna think about… not seeing you again.”</p><p>Agatha froze, breath catching.</p><p>Rio frowned faintly, trying to chase a memory. “Did we talk? At the fire?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha’s voice was too soft, too thin. “But we’ll talk about that when you’re a little less… compromised.”</p><p>Rio smirked — crooked, sleepy. “I’m coherent.”</p><p>“You are not,” Agatha said flatly.</p><p>Rio considered this. “…maybe not.”</p><p>Her hand squeezed Agatha’s clumsily. “Still glad you’re here.”</p><p><br/>Agatha’s apology rose up again, heavy and urgent.</p><p><br/>“Rio… about that night. I shouldn’t have run. I was scared and—”</p><p><br/>Rio cut her off by squeezing her fingers again, eyes sliding half-shut. “Later. When my brain isn’t… soup.”</p><p><br/>Agatha exhaled shakily, relief and dread tangling. “All right.”</p><p><br/>Rio blinked up at her. “Sit closer?”</p><p><br/>Agatha shifted without thinking, moving right up against the mattress, letting Rio rest their joined hands against her side.</p><p><br/>Rio sighed — soft, content — eyes already drifting shut. “Better.”</p><p><br/>Agatha watched her for a long, quiet moment. “Do you want me to stay?”</p><p><br/>Rio didn’t open her eyes. She just whispered, “Please.”</p><p><br/>And that was enough.</p><p><br/>Agatha stayed.</p><p><br/>She stayed as Rio drifted off, stayed as her breathing evened out, stayed as the machines hummed softly in the dim room. </p><p>Rio’s hand remained tangled in hers the entire time.</p><p>The adrenaline crash was hitting her hard now — exhaustion creeping in at the edges, her body finally realising it wasn’t in fight-or-flight anymore. </p><p>Agatha's eyes grew heavy, head dipping forward once, twice…<br/>She nearly drifted off.</p><p>But then—<br/>A muffled commotion echoed from the hallway.</p><p>Low voices.<br/> Boots.<br/> And Wanda’s unmistakably stern “<em>No</em>.”</p><p>Agatha blinked awake, gently untangling her hand from Rio’s before easing off the bed. She cracked the door open quietly… and exhaled a tired, startled sigh.</p><p>Wanda was planted in the middle of the corridor, arms folded, jaw set — a small but immovable wall of red-haired determination.</p><p>And in front of her stood:<br/>Tony — eyes still puffy, holding a comically large bouquet of gas-station flowers. </p><p>Bucky — gripping a stuffed animal he clearly grabbed from the gift shop without looking (a yellow bear with a patch over its eye). </p><p>Steve — holding a casserole dish, because of course he was Steve.</p><p>All three of them looked like children being denied access to a theme park.</p><p>“Wanda,” Steve tried again, usng his Captain voice. “We just want to check on our teammate.”</p><p>“She needs rest,” Wanda said, unbothered. “You three will overstimulate her.”</p><p>Tony pointed at himself. “I am a picture of calm.”</p><p>“You punched a vending machine ten minutes ago,” Wanda replied.</p><p>“That machine <em>took my dollar</em>,” Tony snapped, offended.</p><p>Bucky gestured helplessly with the stuffed bear. “Can’t we at least give her this? She saved my ass twice last month.”</p><p>“No,” Wanda said firmly. “You can give it to her <em>tomorrow.</em>”</p><p>The three men groaned like middle schoolers denied recess.</p><p>Agatha stepped fully into the hall, rubbing a hand over her face. “What exactly is happening?”</p><p>Tony perked up the instant he saw her. “Doc! Great. You tell her. We need to see Rio.”</p><p>“No one is seeing Rio except her doctor and the woman holding her hand,” Wanda said, eyeing Agatha pointedly. “And even that was a gamble.”</p><p>Agatha flushed. “I wasn’t— I mean— I was just—”</p><p>Wanda smirked. “Relax. You’re allowed.”</p><p>Bucky cleared his throat. “So… can <em>we</em> see her now?”</p><p>“No,” Wanda said again.</p><p>Steve tried one last time. “Wanda, please. Just five minutes.”</p><p>Wanda didn’t move. “Captain Rogers, I have seen you go hysterical when Peggy went into labour. If you walk into that room and get emotional, Rio will try to sit up to comfort you, and she has a dislocated shoulder. Absolutely not.”</p><p>Steve deflated.</p><p>Tony dropped onto a chair dramatically. “This is emotional oppression.”</p><p>Wanda rolled her eyes. “This is called letting a patient recover.”</p><p>Agatha bit the inside of her cheek to keep from laughing.</p><p>“You can all come back tomorrow,” Wanda continued. “Preferably after coffee…And showers.”</p><p>Tony sniffed his turnout coat and winced. “Okay. That’s… fair.”</p><p>Bucky sighed. “Tell her we stopped by?”</p><p>Wanda nodded. “I will.”</p><p>Steve turned to Agatha, voice soft. “How’s she doing?”</p><p>Agatha’s chest warmed. “Resting. Safe.”</p><p>Tony’s shoulders dropped in palpable relief.</p><p>“Good,” he whispered.</p><p>Bucky left the bear gently on the counter. “Give her that when she wakes up.”</p><p>Steve placed the casserole beside it. “And this. It’s… Peggy’s recipe.”</p><p>Wanda blinked at the dish. “Steve, why did you bring a lasagna to a hospital?”</p><p>He shrugged solemnly. “It travels well.”</p><p>Agatha finally stepped forward and squeezed Steve’s arm. “Thank you. All of you.”</p><p>Tony, Bucky, and Steve nodded — each looking exhausted, relieved, and grateful.</p><p>“Go home,” Wanda ordered softly. “You’ve all done enough for tonight. And do <em>not</em> wake up Peter either.”</p><p>Agatha watched them walk down the hall together, quieter than she’d ever seen them.</p><p>Wanda turned back to her, expression gentler now. “Go sit with her. She’ll sleep better if you’re there.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, throat tightening. “I will.”</p><p>She slipped back into Rio’s room, closing the door quietly behind her — and Rio stirred just barely at the sound, murmuring something soft in her sleep.</p><p>Agatha moved to her side immediately.</p><p>“Shh,” she whispered, brushing a curl from her forehead. “I’m here.”</p><p>And she stayed, curled up beside her in the padded chair beside her bed, slowly letting her eyes close.</p><p> </p><p>She woke a couple of hours later. </p><p>Her neck hurt. Her lower back throbbed. Her right arm had gone numb where she’d fallen asleep curled awkwardly in the bedside chair.</p><p>But Rio was still there.</p><p>Breathing. <br/>Agatha sat up slowly, rubbing her eyes. The room was dim except for the soft glow of the monitor, its gentle beeps steady and reassuring. Rio lay on her side—well, as much as her immobilised arm and shoulder allowed—blankets tucked up to her collarbone, curls falling messily across her cheek.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>The apology she’d been rehearsing for days rose up again, thick and suffocating.</p><p><em>I’m sorry I ran.</em></p><p><em> I’m sorry I panicked. </em></p><p><em>I’m sorry I hurt you because I was afraid to love you. </em></p><p><em>Please don’t give up on me.</em></p><p>She wasn’t sure where to even begin.</p><p>Her eyes drifted over Rio’s face — the bruising along her cheekbone, the small burn dressing over her shoulder, the cut at her jawline. Every mark on her felt like a tally of how close they’d come to losing each other.</p><p>Agatha clenched her hands in her lap.</p><p><em>You deserve better than what I gave you. Better than my fear. Better than the way I left.</em></p><p><br/>A soft sound broke through her spiralling.</p><p>A sleepy inhale — then a low, rough whisper-<br/>“Aga’tha?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart flipped.</p><p>Rio blinked groggily, eyes unfocused at first… then clearing as she saw who was sitting beside her.</p><p>A slow smile spread across her face. Small. Tired. But real.</p><p>“Hey,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened with affection and guilt all tangled together. “Hi.”</p><p>Rio tried to shift, winced immediately, and sucked in a breath through her teeth.</p><p>“Don’t move,” Agatha said quickly, reaching out to steady her. “Here, let me get you something.”</p><p>She stood, crossed to the medication drawer, pulled out the prescribed pain med syringe, and connected it gently to Rio’s IV port.</p><p>Rio watched her through heavy lashes. “You look tired.”</p><p>“You look worse,” Agatha said softly.</p><p>Rio let out a rough chuckle. “Fair.”</p><p>Agatha injected the dose slowly, the monitor continuing its steady rhythm. When she was done, she set the syringe aside and sat back down beside her — closer this time.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were already growing heavier.</p><p>“Don’t pass out on me yet,” Agatha whispered, brushing a curl from her forehead. “I need you lucid for another minute.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly. “Mm. Talking time?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha’s voice wavered. “Talking time.”</p><p>Rio focused on her — as much as she could through the pain meds — and reached for Agatha’s hand with her good one.</p><p>Agatha took it, threading their fingers together.</p><p>“I need to apologise before these kick in,” she said quietly. “Before you start telling me the walls are made of cheese or that I’m glowing again.”</p><p>Rio smiled sleepily. “You do glow.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. Hard. “Rio… I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio blinked. </p><p>“For running,” Agatha whispered. Her voice cracked on the words. “For leaving that morning. For disappearing and shutting you out. For making you think it was you when it was me the whole time.”</p><p>Rio lay still, watching her.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened. “I was scared. I’m still scared. But that doesn’t excuse it. You deserved honesty — and I hurt you instead.”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak yet. She squeezed Agatha’s hand lightly, encouraging her to continue.</p><p>“I’m going to make it up to you,” Agatha said softly. “All of it. I just… needed you to hear that before the meds pull you under again.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened in a way that nearly undid her.</p><p>“Come closer,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha hesitated — then leaned in until their foreheads rested together, careful not to jostle anything injured.</p><p>Rio exhaled shakily, breath warm against Agatha’s lips. “Thank you. For saying it.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. “I mean every word.”</p><p>Rio smiled faintly, the meds finally tugging her down. “We’ll talk… proper… in the morning.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha breathed. “In the morning.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand once more before her eyes finally drifted closed.</p><p>Agatha stayed right there, their foreheads touching, their hands entwined, letting herself breathe for the first time in days.</p><p> </p>

<p>When Agatha was certain Rio had finally drifted into a deeper, steadier sleep, she slipped from the room. Her body was exhausted, but her mind wouldn’t quiet, not when it kept replaying the image of Rio hauling herself out of that manhole, alive against all odds.</p><p>A shower, she told herself. Just enough to pull herself together before her shift.</p><p>By the time she pushed through the front door, the sky outside was beginning its slow climb into morning. </p><p>Pale light bled across the windows, soft and hesitant, brushing the edges of the quiet house. The only sound was the low hum of the refrigerator and the faint creak of the floor settling in the cool dawn air.</p><p>Agatha shut the door behind her, her fingers shaky on the lock. </p><p>She leaned back against the wood, the breath she’d been holding finally breaking free in a ragged exhale.</p><p>Her hands were trembling.</p><p>And then the night hit her—hard—every moment returning with brutal clarity. Rio trapped beneath concrete. The collapse. The helpless waiting. The sound of Tony’s voice cracking over the radio.</p><p>And finally, Rio emerging from the shadows of that manhole.</p><p>She didn’t have time to compose herself.</p><p>Because Lilia was already there.</p><p>She appeared at the hallway entrance wearing a robe and holding a steaming mug, hair pulled back in a way that suggested she’d been up long before Agatha arrived.</p><p>And the moment she saw Agatha’s face, Lilia knew.</p><p>“Oh sweetheart.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t stand a chance.</p><p>Her face crumpled and she whispered, tiny and cracked, “Mom,” before collapsing straight into Lilia’s arms.</p><p>Lilia pulled her close, one hand in her hair, the other strong between her shoulder blades — a hold Agatha had known since she was twelve, when she showed up on Lilia’s doorstep with a backpack, a bruised heart, and nowhere else to go.</p><p>Lilia had been catching her like this ever since.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” Lilia murmured, guiding her toward her bedroom. “Come on, darling. Breathe.”</p><p>Agatha tried. The breath caught on a quiet sob anyway.</p><p>Lilia settled her onto the bed, placed the warm mug into her shaking hands, and sat beside her, brushing the hair from her face with a tenderness that dissolved Agatha’s last fragile bit of composure.</p><p>“You don’t have to fuss,” Agatha whispered weakly.</p><p>“Oh please,” Lilia scoffed softly. “I’ve been fussing over you since you tried to convince me you could look after yourself.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, a broken little laugh escaping.</p><p>Lilia gave her knee a pat. “Now. How is Rio?”</p><p>Agatha jerked her head up. “You—how did you—?”</p><p>Lilia lifted her phone. “Nat called me. She said half the staff was talking about the callout. Someone said Westview’s Engine 4 crew was hit hardest.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath stuttered.</p><p>“Then Wanda texted,” Lilia added gently. “She said Rio was hurt but alive. Not critical.”</p><p>Agatha pressed a hand to her eyes. “I’m sorry you found out like that.”</p><p>“You think I mind knowing if someone you love is in danger?” Lilia asked softly.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>The word echoed.</p><p>Lilia continued, brushing her thumb across Agatha’s cheek. “Sweetheart, I’ve been keeping track of you since you were practically a child. I don’t stop now just because you pretend you’re made of stone.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened painfully. “She’s okay,” she whispered. “Broken arm. Dislocated shoulder. Some bruising.”</p><p>Lilia’s shoulders relaxed. “Good. I was worried.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “…You were?”</p><p>“Please,” Lilia scoffed. “That girl is practically family at this point. She brings me empanadas. You don’t bring me empanadas unless you’re in it for the long haul.”</p><p>Agatha choked on a laugh. “Lilia…”</p><p>“Don’t ‘Lilia’ me,” she said, smirking. “I’ve lived on this planet far too long to not recognise the look on your face.”</p><p>Agatha rubbed at her eyes. “I almost messed everything up.”</p><p>“Of course you did,” Lilia said brightly. “You panic when things matter to you.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a wounded glare. “Not helpful.”</p><p>“Oh, but it is,” Lilia said, leaning in. “Because it means this matters. She matters.”</p><p>A soft, exhausted sound escaped Agatha.</p><p>“You love her,” Lilia said warmly.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was barely air. “I—I think so.”</p><p>Lilia raised an eyebrow. “You came home crying like I’ve just announced her obituary. And you haven’t cried like that since… well.” She stroked Agatha’s cheek. “Since Boston.”</p><p>The name hit softly, reverberating with years of quiet grief.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “It’s different.”</p><p>“It’s the same,” Lilia corrected gently. “You care. Deeply.”</p><p>Agatha looked down at her tea, voice thin. “I’m scared.”</p><p>“I know,” Lilia said. “But sweet girl… hiding won’t protect you. It never has.”</p><p>Agatha let out a shaky breath, shoulders slumping. “How do I fix it?”</p><p>“By showing up,” Lilia said simply. “By talking. By apologising. By letting her love you the way you deserve.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her. “Do you really think she…?”</p><p>“I think she made it back to you from a burning building,” Lilia said dryly. “Yes, dear. She cares.”</p><p>Agatha let out a weak, helpless laugh.</p><p>Lilia kissed her forehead. “Now go shower. You reek of smoke and look like you’ve aged about twenty years.”</p><p>Agatha groaned. “That’s rude.”</p><p>“It’s accurate,” Lilia said. “And tell Rio I send my love. And also that if she pulls another stunt like that, I’ll ground her.”</p><p>Agatha managed a real smile.</p><p>“Thanks mom,” she whispered. </p><p>“That’s my brave girl,” Lilia murmured as Agatha rose, steadier than she’d been in days.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha returned to the hospital—hair damp, clean scrubs on, exhaustion tucked beneath thin professionalism—she headed straight for Rio’s room.</p><p>The door was mostly closed.</p><p>Mostly.</p><p>And Agatha heard voices inside.</p><p>Rio’s voice, low and warm.</p><p> And Yelena’s… decidedly not professional voice.</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>Yelena: “You know, if you need someone to help you wash your hair with your arm like that… I am <em>very</em> good with my hands.”</p><p>Rio barked a surprised laugh. “Belova—”</p><p>Yelena snorted a laugh, “Relax, Im just messing with you.”</p><p>Rio was still laughing when she spotted something over Yelena’s shoulder.</p><p>She immediately sat up straighter.</p><p>Yelena followed her gaze.</p><p>The temperature in the room dropped ten degrees.</p><p>Agatha stood in the doorway, arms crossed, expression like cool steel dipped in subtle murder.</p><p>Yelena froze.</p><p>“Oh <em>shit</em>,” she squeaked. “Doctor Harkness. How… long have you been standing there?”</p><p>Agatha stepped inside slowly. “Long enough.”</p><p>Yelena gulped.</p><p>Rio bit her lip to keep from laughing.</p><p>Agatha moved toward the bed with measured steps, her gaze still pinned on Yelena.</p><p>“Belova,” she said sharply.</p><p>Yelena straightened like a soldier in front of a general. “Yes, Doctor?”</p><p>“If you are done offering to bathe my girlfriend—”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened slightly.</p><p> Yelena’s soul left her body.</p><p>Agatha continued calmly, “I’d appreciate it if you finished adjusting the IV without… the vulgar inuendos.”</p><p>Yelena nodded so fast her braid whipped. “Absolutely. Silent as grave—no, no, bad metaphor. I mean—quiet. I am quiet.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “Good.”</p><p>Yelena snapped the IV line into place with lightning speed, stepped away from Rio like she was radioactive, and plastered herself against the far wall.</p><p>“I will… go now,” she announced. </p><p>Rio couldn’t hold back her grin. “You okay, Yelena?”</p><p>“No!” Yelena squeaked, then caught herself. “I mean—yes. Fine. Wonderful. Goodbye!”</p><p>She practically <em>ran</em> out of the room.</p><p>As soon as the door shut, Rio burst into laughter.</p><p>“You scared the shit out of her,” Rio said.</p><p>“I did not,” Agatha sniffed.</p><p>“You absolutely did!” Rio teased, eyes sparkling. “You thought he was flirting and you looked at her like you were about to take her head clean off.”</p><p>Agatha sat on the edge of the bed and took Rio’s hand, thumb brushing over her knuckles. “I’m not… threatened.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly. “No?”</p><p>Agatha leaned down, kissed Rio’s temple, and murmured against her skin, “But she needed to know who you belong to.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught, her fingers tightening around Agatha’s hand.</p><p>For a moment she didn’t say anything.</p><p>Then, quietly-</p><p>“Agatha… did you just call me your girlfriend?”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Actually froze.</p><p>Her entire body went still, lips parted, eyes widening with a very un-Agatha-like flash of panic.</p><p>“I—well—yes, but—Rio, I didn’t mean to assume—”</p><p> She pulled back slightly, flustered in a way she never was with anyone else.</p><p> “Fuck Rio, I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said it like that. You deserve better than me blurting things out without talking first and I know I have <em>so much</em> to make up for and I know I hurt you when I left and I know—”</p><p>Rio cut her off with a soft, shaky laugh.</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard. “Yes?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, warm and certain.</p><p> “I would be happy to be your girlfriend.”</p><p>All the air left Agatha’s lungs at once.</p><p>She blinked, stunned, lips parting like she wasn’t sure she’d heard correctly.</p><p>“…You would?”</p><p>Rio nodded, brushing her thumb over the back of Agatha’s hand.</p><p> “Yeah. I mean—yes. Definitely yes.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders dropped, relief crashing through her so forcefully she had to steady herself on the mattress.</p><p>A quiet, unsteady laugh escaped her. “I don’t know why you’d want me after everything.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her fingers gently.</p><p> “Because you came back.”</p><p> Her voice trembled, barely holding steady.</p><p> “Because you were about to run straight into hell for me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught. She lowered her head until her forehead rested against Rio’s, the soft brush of their noses almost painful in its sweetness. Her voice came out raw and honest.</p><p>“I’d run into a thousand fires for you.”</p><p>Rio exhaled shakily, the air between them warm. “Guess that makes it official then.”</p><p>Agatha cupped Rio’s jaw gently, thumb tracing soot-smudged skin. This time she didn’t kiss her temple. She tilted Rio’s chin up and kissed her mouth—slow, soft, lingering. A kiss that wasn’t about urgency or fear, but about choosing her. About coming home.</p><p>Rio melted instantly, her good hand curling weakly into Agatha’s scrub top, pulling her closer. Their lips moved in small, careful motions—pain meds and bruises be damned—as if they were relearning each other in this new, gentler way.</p><p>When they finally parted, breath mingled, their foreheads still touching.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was barely a whisper.</p><p> “I’m… your girlfriend.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened into something warm and stunned and unbearably tender.</p><p> “Yeah,” she whispered back. “And I’m yours.”</p><p>Agatha smiled against Rio’s lips before kissing her once more—another soft, claiming brush—just because she could.</p><p>The door creaked ope, breaking the softness in the room.</p><p>Teen stepped inside, clipboard in hand… and stopped dead.</p><p>His eyes went comically wide.</p><p>“Oh—oh! Uh—Dr. Harkness! I—I didn’t mean to—uh—interrupt anything.”</p><p> He flailed backward a half-step, cheeks turning pink. “I swear I knocked. I think? Maybe? I probably did.”</p><p>Agatha straightened, smoothing her hair, trying to look like she hadn’t just been whispering romantic nonsense into her <em>girlfriend’s</em> ear.</p><p> Rio bit back a smile.</p><p>Teen cleared his throat, eyes darting anywhere except at them.</p><p> “Um. Right. So. I’m here because… uh… Ortho reviewed Rio’s scans.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “Yeah?”</p><p>“Yeah!” Teen said, still flustered. “And they, uh… they’ve scheduled you for surgery to set the fracture. Dr. Danvers is on for the morning list, so you’re first case.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, instantly slipping into serious mode. “Good. Earlier is better—the swelling will be manageable.”</p><p>Teen nodded rapidly. “Exactly. She’ll come talk to you before pre-op in about an hour.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Rio said gently, trying to ease the poor boy’s embarrassment.</p><p>“Yeah—yes—of course.”<br/> He backed toward the door, nearly hitting it with his heel. “And, um… I didn’t see anything.”</p><p>Agatha lifted an eyebrow. “Teen.”</p><p>He squeaked. “Yes ma’am?”</p><p>“Out.”</p><p>“Leaving,” he said, voice cracking adorably as he fled out the door.</p><p>The moment it clicked shut, Rio snorted.</p><p>Agatha sighed, pinching between her brows. “We’re never hearing the end of that.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand, smiling sleepily. “He looked happy for us.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart stuttered.</p><p>“…Yeah,” she murmured softly. “He did.”</p><p> </p><p>Pre-op was quieter than the rest of the surgical wing, curtains drawn around bays, soft beeping from monitors echoing through the dimly lit space. Rio sat propped in her wheelchair, sling secure, blanket over her legs, Agatha still behind her like a sentinel who refused to let go.</p><p>A soft voice came from the entrance.</p><p>“Um… excuse me? Is this… Rio Vidal’s pre-op bay?”</p><p>Agatha turned just enough to see Peter Parker standing there, face bruised, eyebrow stitched, and looking painfully sheepish. </p><p>Beside him stood a woman in her late forties with kind eyes and an expression of both exhaustion and fierce gratitude.</p><p>Rio blinked, surprised. “Peter?”</p><p>He stepped inside, biting his lip. “Hi. They’re, uh… letting me go home today. But I wanted to see you before your surgery. Oh uh, this is my aunt May.”</p><p>May nudged him gently. “Go on, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio smiled softly. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Like I got thrown by a giant,” Peter admitted, rubbing the back of his neck. “But also… like the luckiest idiot alive.” His eyes went shiny. “You saved me. You came back for me when you didn’t have to.”</p><p>Rio’s expression softened. “I would never leave you, kid. You know that.”</p><p>Peter swallowed hard.</p><p>May stepped forward, her voice thick with emotion. “I don’t know how to thank you. You ran into that building when everyone else was saying it was too unstable. You got my nephew out when… when you might not have made it out yourself.”</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, wincing at the movement. “He’s worth it.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand tightened around the wheelchair handle, her heart twisting painfully at the reminder.</p><p>Peter stepped closer and gently rested his good hand over Rio’s. “I thought you were right behind me. I didn’t know— I didn’t know you fell. If anything had happened—” His breath shook. “I’m really glad you’re okay.”</p><p>Rio squeezed his fingers. “Takes more than a basement and some bad architecture to finish me off.”<br/>Peter laughed wetly.</p><p>May finally stepped forward and surprised everyone by pulling Rio into a careful hug, mindful of her injured side. “You’re family now,” she whispered. “Like it or not. And that means we owe you dinner for life.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly. “Deal.”</p><p>Agatha blinked hard — because watching Rio be loved so openly by the people she’d nearly died protecting made warmth bloom behind her ribs.</p><p>Peter looked between them, his brows lifting in realisation. “Oh! Doctor Harkness, right?”</p><p>Agatha nodded politely. “Agatha.”</p><p>Peter’s smile turned sheepish and turned to aunt May. “Thats the one Rio talks about all the time.”</p><p>Agatha flushed scarlet.</p><p>Rio groaned. “Can someone sedate me early?”</p><p>The nurse passing by snorted.</p><p>Agatha moved to Rio’s side and gently brushed a curl from her forehead. “Don’t worry. You’ll be unconscious soon.”</p><p>Rio rolled her eyes but smiled.</p><p>Peter stepped back with May. “We should let you get ready,” he said. “But… thank you again. For everything.”</p><p>May added softly, “We’ll be sending every good thought your way.”</p><p>Agatha nodded gratefully. “Thank you both.”</p><p>Peter gave Rio one more shy wave before they left the bay.</p><p>When they were gone, Agatha looked down at Rio, voice quieter now.</p><p>“He cares about you,” she said.</p><p>Rio shrugged gently. “Hes a good kid.”</p><p>Agatha felt something settle in her chest — something warm and certain.</p><p>“You’re a good person,” she murmured.</p><p>Rio smiled up at her, tired but honest. “You say that like it surprises you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>She didn’t have to.</p><p>Her hand found Rio’s again — steady, protective - and neither of them let go.</p><p><br/>Rio had been wheeled through the double doors two hours and forty-five minutes ago.</p><p>Agatha had been pacing for two hours, forty-five minutes and one second.</p><p>Jen could personally confirm it.</p><p>Because Agatha’s nervous energy had started to vibrate the entire nurses’ station.</p><p>Agatha dropped into a chair, opened a patient chart, took one look at it… and began flipping through pages like she was trying to start a fire with friction alone.</p><p>Jen watched her for a full five seconds before saying, “Jesus Christ, Harkness, that chart didn’t kill your family. Calm down.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even blink. “I <em>am</em> calm.”</p><p>Jen blinked slowly, the way one does when witnessing a person lie directly to their face.</p><p>“You’re shaking,” she pointed out.</p><p>“I’m cold,” Agatha snapped.</p><p>“It’s 75 degrees in here,” Jen replied. “You’re sweating.”</p><p>Agatha aggressively turned a page.</p><p>Wanda, sitting at the other end of the desk, murmured, “She’s in coping mode. Let her spiral.”</p><p>Jen shot Wanda a glare. “No. Because <em>her</em> coping mode is giving <em>me</em> a migraine.”</p><p>Agatha scribbled something so viciously on a chart that the pen tip <em>snapped</em>. She stared at it, betrayed. </p><p>“Why do pens break when you need them?”</p><p>Jen pinched the bridge of her nose. “Because you’re giving it the death grip.”</p><p>Agatha grabbed another pen.</p><p>Jen snatched it out of her hand.</p><p>“HEY—”</p><p>“Nope,” Jen said, standing and planting her hand over the chart. “You’re charting wrong.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “I <em>invented</em> half the shortcuts in this department.”</p><p>“And you’re charting like a feral cat today. Go sit in a corner before you misfile someone’s appendectomy under neurology.”</p><p>Wanda snorted into her coffee.</p><p>Agatha scowled at both of them, stood, paced, sat, stood again, paced again…</p><p>Jen groaned into her palms. “Oh my God. You’re worse than Alice when she quit vaping.”</p><p>Agatha whirled on her. “Rio is in surgery.”</p><p>“Yes,” Jen said patiently. “On a non-emergent fracture. One Ortho has done a thousand times. She’s going to be fine.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, closed it, then whispered harshly: “What if—”</p><p>“Nope,” Jen cut in immediately. “I’m not letting you spiral in surround-sound. Sit. The fuck. Down.”</p><p>Agatha sat.</p><p>Three seconds later she popped back up.</p><p>“I need air.”</p><p>Wanda lifted a brow. “You need sedation.”</p><p>Agatha glared. “I’m going to check her chart in the system.”</p><p>Jen actually laughed. “You’re not allowed within ten feet of her chart. Romanoff locked it after you tried to override her access to get into Pre-op.”</p><p>Agatha froze mid-step. “She… what?”</p><p>Jen nodded. “Oh yeah. Full lockdown. Said, and I quote, ‘Harkness can look at it when Rio wakes up and she finally tells her she loves her.’”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked. “She said WHAT—”</p><p>Before Jen could continue torturing her, the OR doors finally opened.</p><p>Dr Carol Danvers stepped out, peeling off her cap.</p><p>Agatha stood so fast her chair skidded back.</p><p>Jen muttered, “Showtime,” under her breath and stepped aside.</p><p>Agatha stood rigid, pulse pounding in her ears, bracing for news that could either shatter her… or finally let her breathe.</p><p>Carol Danvers appeared at the end of the corridor, peeling off her surgical cap with practiced ease. She strode toward the desk, picked up a chart, and spoke with her usual cool efficiency.</p><p>“She’s in recovery. We set the ulnar and radial fractures and reduced the shoulder. Everything went smoothly.”</p><p>The air left Agatha’s lungs in a shaky rush.</p><p>“Oh… thank God.”</p><p>Carol’s eyebrow lifted as she flipped the chart open. “Did you doubt me, Harkness?” A smirk tugged at her mouth.</p><p>“Not for a second,” Agatha said, already stepping past her. “It’s just been a very long few days.”</p><p>Carol chuckled softly as Agatha hurried down the hall toward recovery, relief loosening every muscle in her body for the first time since the warehouse collapsed.</p><p>When Agatha stepped into the recovery suite, Rio was already propped up against the pillows, blinking sleepily as the last of the anaesthesia wore off. Her arm was immobilised in fresh plaster, secured neatly in a blue shoulder sling. </p><p>One of the surgical nurses was adjusting her IV line, checking the monitors with efficient, gentle movements.</p><p>Rio’s eyes found Agatha instantly.</p><p>They lit up—bright, warm, utterly unguarded—and a dopey, lopsided smile spread across her face.</p><p>“Oh hey, <em>Doctor girlfriend</em>,” she slurred happily. “I dreamed about you.”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks flamed.</p><p> She glanced sharply away, doing her best to hide behind her hair while the nurse gave her a look that balanced perfectly between amusement and <em>oh, honey, I’ve seen this a thousand times.</em></p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and marched to the foot of the bed, grabbing Rio’s chart with the intensity of someone clinging to professionalism by a thread.</p><p>“As you can see,” she said, very pointedly to the chart and not the idiotically radiant woman in the bed, “the surgery went well. We just need to keep you on your pain medication… which appears to be working extremely well.”</p><p>Rio beamed. “You’re so pretty.”</p><p>Agatha pretended not to hear that.</p><p>The nurse coughed lightly, trying not to smile. “Dr. Danvers administered morphine PCA post-op. She’s comfortable and stable. Vitals are good.” She paused, then added with a teasing tilt of her voice, “Very good.”</p><p>Agatha gave a stiff nod. “Thank you. I’ll… take it from here.”</p><p>The nurse excused herself, still smiling as she slipped out and gently pulled the door halfway closed behind her.</p><p>Only then did Agatha let out a long breath she didn’t realise she was holding.</p><p>She turned back to Rio—and her resolve cracked instantly.</p><p>Rio was smiling at her like she was sunlight.</p><p>Soft, dopey, utterly besotted.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, unable to stop the fond tug at her own lips. She stepped closer to the bed, her voice gentler, warmer, no longer pretending she was made of stone.</p><p>“You’re impossible,” she murmured.</p><p>Rio just kept staring at her, eyes soft and shining, like she’d woken up to everything she ever wanted.</p><p>Agatha perched carefully on the edge of the bed, turning to face Rio. The mattress dipped under her weight, and Rio’s eyes tracked the movement as if even that felt comforting. Agatha lifted a hand, brushing her thumb over the curve of Rio’s cheek.</p><p>“How are you feeling?” she asked softly.</p><p>Rio leaned into her palm with a dreamy sigh. “Better now.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a quiet laugh, shaking her head. “Stop being so adorable. You’re going to ruin my reputation in this hospital, Vidal.”</p><p>Rio’s smile grew slow and crooked. “Maybe it’s time everyone knew the real you.” She blinked lazily, the pain meds softening her voice. “My you.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, caught off guard by the gentle claim in those words. <em>My you.</em></p><p> Rio had always seen right past the armour—straight into the softer, quieter parts Agatha hid from the world. It unnerved her. It grounded her. It made her feel… known.</p><p>And she had never let anyone do that. Not since she was a teenager. Not in Boston. Not here.</p><p> But Rio walked in like she belonged in all the locked rooms Agatha had kept closed.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze softened as she searched Rio’s face.</p><p>“You undo me, Rio Vidal,” she whispered. “I don’t know how you do it… but you do.”</p><p>Rio blinked up at her, the fog of medication making her impossibly sincere. “You undo me too,” she murmured. “You showed up for me. You came back.” Her good hand lifted clumsily, trying to reach Agatha’s wrist. “You stayed.”</p><p>Agatha caught the hand gently and threaded their fingers together, lowering her forehead to rest against Rio’s. She felt Rio’s warmth, her breath, the steady beat of her life under Agatha’s fingers. It made her chest tighten in a way that was almost painful but entirely right.</p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” Agatha whispered. “Not again.”</p><p>Rio smiled against her cheek. “Good… ’cause I’m in love with you.”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Just for a heartbeat.</p><p>Then Rio’s eyelids fluttered, and she slurred, “Pretty sure. Maybe. Feels like it.”</p><p>Agatha felt her heart flip and settle and bloom all at once.</p><p>She brushed her fingers through Rio’s hair. “We’re going to revisit that statement when you’re not high as a kite, okay?”</p><p>Rio hummed happily. “Still true.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her forehead—soft, careful, lingering. “Rest, sweetheart.”</p><p>Rio melted into the pillows, still smiling, their hands loosely intertwined.</p><p>And Agatha stayed right where she was, watching her, protecting her, her heart slowly stitching itself back together in the quiet of that recovery room.</p>

<p>The next day dragged on with frustrating slowness.<br/> Agatha kept telling herself Rio probably didn’t remember the hazy “<em>I’m in love with you</em>,” whispered while drifting in and out of sedation.</p><p>Of course she didn’t. </p><p>It didn’t count. </p><p>It couldn’t.</p><p>Agatha repeated that to herself every hour.</p><p>And every hour, someone else was in Rio’s room when she tried to check on her.</p><p>Tony crying apologies into his hands, Bucky adjusting Rio’s pillows twenty-seven times, Alice bringing half her apartment in a tote bag.</p><p>By late afternoon, Agatha finally found a quiet moment.</p><p>Or so she thought.</p><p>She rounded the corner… and stopped dead.</p><p>Lilia was in the chair next to Rio’s bed.<br/> A tin of cookies sat open on the table.<br/> Rio was chewing happily, her mouth full, crumbs on her lip.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Lilia? What—what are you doing here?”</p><p>Lilia looked up, serene as a queen. “Well I came to visit Rio of course. She tells me she’s being discharged tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart lurched. “Tomorrow?!”</p><p>Rio swallowed quickly. “Apparently so.”</p><p>Lilia folded her hands primly in her lap. “So of course, I asked her how she expects to look after herself with a broken arm and fractured ribs.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes went slightly wide.</p><p>“Oh, I’ll be fine,” she said, too brightly. “Alice is around sometimes.”</p><p>Lilia scoffed so hard she nearly choked. “Sometimes? Darling, you can barely tie your hair with one hand. What exactly are you planning to do when she’s not there?”</p><p>Rio flushed. “I—well—I didn’t think—”</p><p>“No,” Lilia said decisively. “You didn’t.”</p><p>Then she smiled at Rio with all the kindness of a woman about to drop a bomb.<br/> “So I will suggest the obvious. You’re coming to stay with us until you’re more mobile.”</p><p>Both Rio and Agatha froze.</p><p>Rio’s cookie nearly fell out of her hand.<br/> Agatha’s mouth opened and closed like a startled goldfish.</p><p>“Lilia, I—I can’t just—<em>stay</em> with you,” Rio sputtered. “I don’t want to be a burden.”</p><p>“Nonsense,” Lilia waved off. “You need attentive care. Real care. Someone who won’t let you overdo it. Someone who knows what they’re doing.”</p><p>Agatha’s brain short-circuited.</p><p>Rio staying with Lilia. </p><p>Which meant she would be living with Rio.</p><p> Rio.</p><p>In her house. …Where Agatha could check on her, fuss over her, keep her safe—</p><p>She snapped herself out of it before she smiled too wide.</p><p>Instead, she cleared her throat, slipping on the white-coat tone like armour. </p><p>“Well, medically speaking, Lilia is correct. Trauma to the arm and shoulder severely limits day-to-day functioning, and early post-operative overuse can lead to setbacks, reinjury, or—”</p><p>Lilia turned slowly and pinned her with a knowing look.</p><p>Agatha’s professional veneer melted instantly.</p><p>Lilia smiled — warm, amused, victorious. “Sweetheart, you don’t need to justify it. I already know exactly why you want her close.”</p><p>Rio turned bright pink.</p><p>Agatha nearly combusted.</p><p>“I—I just meant—” Agatha stammered.</p><p>Lilia stood gracefully, gathering her cookie tin. “I’ll give you two a moment.”</p><p>She kissed Agatha’s cheek, then Rio’s forehead.</p><p>“And darling,” she told Rio sweetly, “start thinking about which room you’d like. The guest room is nice and all but the morning sun is a bit much. Agatha’s room however, has a lovely view <em>and</em> a kingsize bed.”</p><p>Rio made a soft choking sound.</p><p>Agatha quietly did the same.</p><p>Lilia swept out of the room with the confidence of a woman who just solved a problem no one had admitted aloud.</p><p>The door clicked shut.</p><p>Silence settled.</p><p>Rio stared at Agatha.</p><p>Agatha stared at Rio.</p><p>Rio whispered, “She’s serious, isn’t she?”</p><p>Agatha gave a tiny, resigned nod. “Oh, absolutely. That woman has never suggested anything in her life that she didn’t intend to enforce.”</p><p>Rio let out a breath, half laugh, half disbelief. “Wow.”</p><p>They looked at each other for a beat — long enough for the shock to soften into something gentler.</p><p>Agatha felt it happen before she could stop it, a small, helpless smile curled at her lips.</p><p>Rio caught it instantly, her own smile shy and warm, her ears flushing pink. “Would it… be alright with you?” she asked quietly. “Me staying there?”</p><p>Agatha searched her face — bruised, tired, but so undeniably Rio — and something inside her eased.</p><p>“It would be more than alright,” Agatha said softly. “If it means I get to keep a close eye on you… then yes.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders relaxed, a sheepish grin blooming. “Well. Okay then. Guess that’s settled.”</p><p> She paused, smirking lightly. “Wow. Moving in together already. What a lesbian cliché.”</p><p>Agatha snorted before she could help it and swatted her very gently on the uninjured arm. “Temporarily, Vidal. Don’t get too settled.”</p><p>Rio laughed — a quiet, breathy sound that slipped under Agatha’s ribs and lodged itself somewhere warm.</p><p>The moment lingered between them, soft and a little ridiculous. Agatha felt it—felt herself—teetering on the edge of something frighteningly tender. She tucked a loose curl behind her ear, needing an anchor, some kind of reset before she did something obvious like stare at Rio’s mouth again.</p><p>She cleared her throat lightly. “So… how are you feeling?”</p><p>Rio blinked and shifted her head toward her—slowly, carefully, because even that small motion tugged across bruised ribs. A wry smile curved at her lips.</p><p>“Besides the whole ‘Lilia adopting me against my will’ thing?”</p><p>A faint smile tugged at Agatha’s lips. “Physically, I meant.”</p><p>Rio shifted a little, wincing. “Arm hurts. Shoulder aches. Ribs feel like someone used them as a drum kit. But… manageable.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, falling gently into doctor mode. “Pain level?”</p><p>“Like a seven,” Rio admitted. “But I’m okay.”</p><p>“You don’t have to be okay all the time,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened.</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>This was the moment.<br/> Casual. Subtle. Gentle.</p><p>She could ask—just check—if Rio remembered last night’s confession.<br/> The one that had been echoing relentlessly in her own chest-<br/><em>I’m in love with you</em>.</p><p>Surely Rio didn’t mean it. </p><p>Surely it was the meds. </p><p>Surely feelings that big couldn’t happen after everything she’d put Rio through.</p><p>Agatha perched on the edge of the bed, fingers worrying at the hem of her sleeve. “Um… speaking of last night.”</p><p>Rio raised a brow. “Yeah?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed.<br/> God, this was ridiculous. She was a triple-board-certified surgeon, this shouldn’t be the hardest sentence she’d ever tried to form.</p><p>“Well, you were… medicated,” Agatha began carefully. “And sometimes people say things when they’re medicated that they might not… completely mean. Or remember.”</p><p>Rio blinked slowly. “Okay…”</p><p>“And sometimes they say things that sound… significant. Potentially. But perhaps aren’t actually…” She waved her hands vaguely.<br/> “…meant in a literal sense.”</p><p>Rio stared at her, confused but patient.</p><p>“So I just wanted to check how you’re feeling today,” Agatha continued, hating how breathless her voice sounded. “Emotionally. Mentally. You know. In case you, um… remember anything specific you said.”</p><p>Rio’s face shifted—slowly, subtly—from confusion to dawning amusement.</p><p>“Oh,” she said softly. “You mean… the part where I told you I was in love with you?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart stopped.</p><p>She froze. Completely. Absolutely.</p><p>Rio watched her reaction—every tiny flicker of panic and hope across her face—and then her own expression softened into something gentle and devastatingly sure.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio whispered. “I remember.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, but nothing came out.</p><p>“And I meant it,” Rio added quietly. “Every word.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath trembled.</p><p>She’d been prepared for denial.</p><p> For laughter. </p><p>For Rio chalking it up to morphine dreams and hazy edges.</p><p>But not this.<br/>Never this.</p><p>Agatha’s voice came out a whisper. “You… did?”</p><p>Rio nodded once. Slowly. “I did. And I do.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse skittered, wild and unsteady. “Rio…”</p><p>Rio reached for her hand—awkwardly, with her uninjured one—and brushed their fingers together.</p><p>“You don’t have to say anything back,” Rio murmured. “I just don’t want you thinking it was the drugs talking. It was me.”</p><p>Agatha felt something in her chest unfold—frail, terrified, unbelievably tender.</p><p>She didn’t respond yet.</p><p> She couldn’t.</p><p> But Rio’s honesty warmed the room, melted something sharp in Agatha’s ribs.</p><p>Rio gave her a small smile. “So… how are <em>you</em> feeling today?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, eyes shining just faintly. “Terrified,” she admitted. “But… in a way that feels a little less like drowning.”</p><p>Rio’s thumb traced a gentle line across her hand. “Good. I can work with that.”</p><p> </p><p>Later, Agatha was quietly reviewing labs at the nurses’ station when she became aware of it.</p><p>The feeling.</p><p>The unmistakable sensation of being watched.</p><p>She didn’t look up at first. She adjusted the chart. Scrolled once more. Pretended not to notice.</p><p>Then Jen cleared her throat.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Wanda shifted her weight.</p><p>Still nothing.</p><p>Agatha finally sighed and looked up, eyes sharp and already irritated. “If you’re both going to stare at me like that, you might as well spit it out.”</p><p>Jen and Wanda exchanged a look.</p><p>A long one.</p><p>Then Wanda tilted her head, voice light and entirely too curious. “So… you and Rio?”</p><p>Agatha felt the heat hit her face instantly. “No.”</p><p>Jen blinked. “That was very fast.”</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “That was very definitive.”</p><p>Wanda raised an eyebrow. “Was it, though?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth, closed it, and glared at the chart in front of her like it had betrayed her.</p><p>“This is not an interrogation,” she said stiffly. “And this isn’t high school.”</p><p>Jen smiled, unbothered. “No, but it <em>is</em> two people who almost count as your friends.”</p><p>“Almost,” Agatha muttered.</p><p>Wanda leaned on the counter. “And friends ask questions. Especially when someone starts hovering around a patient like they’re personally responsible for her continued existence.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “She nearly died.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Jen said gently. “That tends to …cause epiphanies.”</p><p>Agatha shifted, uncomfortable. “I don’t see how this is any of your business.”</p><p>Wanda smiled, soft this time. “Because you look happier. Terrified, exhausted, but… lighter.”</p><p>Jen nodded. “And because it’s okay to say it out loud sometimes. You don’t have to do everything alone.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, jaw tightening. For a moment, it looked like she might snap.</p><p>Instead, she exhaled sharply. “This is ridiculous.”</p><p>Jen grinned. “So… is that a yes?”</p><p>Agatha snatched up her tablet. “I have patients.”</p><p>Wanda called after her, amused, “We’ll take that as a ‘to be continued.’”</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn around.<br/>But she didn’t deny it either.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>By the next afternoon, Rio had officially been discharged.</p><p>The hospital doors slid shut behind them, and Agatha felt the weight of the last few days ease just a little. Relief settled in her chest, tangled with a nervous energy she hadn’t quite learned how to name yet. She stayed close as Rio eased into the passenger seat, one hand hovering at her back longer than necessary, just in case.</p><p>The drive home was quiet in the good way. Not awkward, not strained. Just two people sharing space, glancing at each other at red lights, small smiles passing between them like secrets.</p><p>When they pulled into the driveway, Agatha was out of the car immediately. She opened Rio’s door and offered her arm without thinking twice.</p><p>“Slow,” she murmured, gentle but firm.</p><p>Rio smiled up at her, soft and fond. “You’re very serious about this.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved. “I’m serious about <em>you</em>.”</p><p>The words surprised them both. Agatha felt her face warm but didn’t take them back. Rio’s fingers tightened around her arm, grounding, grateful.</p><p>Alice’s handiwork was obvious the moment Agatha opened the trunk. Rio’s backpack was overstuffed, clothes folded in a rush, a hoodie half-hanging out the zipper. Alice hadn’t needed much persuasion once she heard she and Jen would have the apartment to themselves. She’d hugged Rio carefully, winked at Agatha, and disappeared with impressive speed.</p><p>Agatha slung the backpack over her shoulder and guided Rio toward the house, their steps slow and synchronised.</p><p>The door opened before they knocked.</p><p>Lilia stood there, smiling warmly, eyes soft as she took in the sight of them together. “Welcome home,” she said simply.</p><p>Rio smiled, shy but sincere. “Thank you for letting me stay.”</p><p>Lilia waved them inside. “You’re always welcome here.”</p><p>Inside, the house felt calm and sunlit, a quiet contrast to the chaos they’d just come from. Agatha helped Rio out of her shoes, hands careful, fingers brushing Rio’s ankle just long enough to send a small thrill up her spine. She steadied Rio on the stairs, her palm warm at Rio’s back, her thumb making slow, absent circles as they climbed.</p><p>At the top of the stairs, Agatha paused.</p><p>Her room was just down the hall.</p><p>The thought of bringing Rio there tugged at her, tempting and terrifying. The idea of Rio in her bed, of waking up and reaching out to find her there, made her chest ache. She swallowed, reminding herself they were new, that going slow mattered.</p><p>She turned instead and opened the door to the guest room.</p><p>“This is for you,” Agatha said softly. “For now.”</p><p>Rio looked around, then back at Agatha, reading her easily. She reached out with her good hand and brushed her fingers over Agatha’s wrist, a quiet reassurance. “This is perfect,” she said. “Really.”</p><p>Agatha helped her sit, adjusted the pillows, smoothed the blanket. She noticed the way Rio’s shoulders sagged slightly once she was settled, the exhaustion finally catching up to her now that she was safe.</p><p>“Do you need anything?” Agatha asked quietly. “Water? Another pillow? Your pain meds?”</p><p>Rio smiled, tired but content. “Just… a minute to rest. The whole getting here took more out of me than I thought.”</p><p>Agatha nodded immediately. She reached out, brushing her thumb gently over Rio’s knuckles, a small, grounding touch. “I’ll let you sleep. I’ll be right downstairs.”</p><p>Rio’s gaze softened. “Okay.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, pressing a light kiss to Rio’s temple, careful and affectionate. “Call me if you need me.”</p><p>“I will,” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha lingered for one more heartbeat, taking her in, then quietly slipped out of the room, closing the door with care.</p><p><br/>She moved down the stairs slowly, still half caught in that strange, tender calm that had settled over her chest. It wasn’t until she reached the bottom step that she realised her face felt… different.</p><p>Soft.</p><p>Smiling.</p><p>The realisation barely had time to register before she looked up.</p><p>Lilia was sitting on the couch.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>Hands folded neatly in her lap. Posture relaxed. Expression unmistakably smug.</p><p>Agatha’s smile vanished instantly.</p><p>Her mouth flattened. Her shoulders straightened. Whatever warmth had been written across her face disappeared behind instinct and pride in the space of a heartbeat.</p><p>Lilia’s eyes flicked up to meet hers, bright with quiet triumph. The corner of her mouth curved just enough to say <em>I saw that</em>.</p><p>“Well,” Lilia said mildly.</p><p>Agatha cleared her throat and continued down the stairs with deliberate composure, as though nothing at all had happened upstairs. “She’s resting,” she said, tone clipped and professional. “The drive tired her out.”</p><p>“Mm,” Lilia hummed, clearly unconvinced.</p><p>Agatha busied herself with the coffee table, straightening a magazine that was already aligned. “Pain’s controlled. I told her to call if she needs anything.”</p><p>Lilia said nothing.</p><p>The silence stretched.</p><p>Finally, Lilia smiled openly now, warm and victorious. “You were smiling.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled softly. “Of course you don’t.”</p><p>Agatha lifted her chin. “I’m going to start dinner.”</p><p>She walked toward the kitchen with all the dignity she could summon, back straight, expression perfectly neutral.</p><p>Behind her, Lilia leaned back into the couch cushions, entirely satisfied.</p><p>Some things didn’t need to be said out loud to be understood.</p><p>Ten minutes later, Agatha stood in the kitchen, phone in hand, scrolling with a growing frown that had settled between her brows and refused to leave.</p><p>“Comfort food” was apparently an impossibly vague concept.</p><p>Everything she found felt wrong. Too heavy. Too bland. Too involved. Too performative. She didn’t want something flashy or indulgent. She wanted something that said rest and you’re safe and I care about you—and none of the recipes seemed to convey that.</p><p>She exhaled sharply and dropped the phone onto the counter like it had betrayed her.</p><p>“This is ridiculous,” she muttered. “I can remove a fucking kidney, but I can’t—”</p><p>She stopped mid-spiral, eyes flicking toward the living room.</p><p>Lilia was sitting on the couch, glasses perched on her nose, flipping through a book like she didn’t have a care in the world. She hadn’t said a word since Agatha came downstairs, but Agatha could feel her presence the way she always could. Steady. Observant. Waiting.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, her fingers drumming on the counter. </p><p>Then, quietly, a little begrudgingly, she said, “Lilia?”</p><p>Lilia looked up at once, already smiling. “Yes, darling?”</p><p>Agatha shifted her weight, suddenly aware of how absurd she must look standing there like a lost intern in her own kitchen. “I… need help.”</p><p>Lilia raised an eyebrow. “That’s new.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look. “I’m serious.”</p><p>“So am I,” Lilia replied mildly, closing her book and setting it aside. She rose and padded into the kitchen, stopping beside Agatha and glancing at the abandoned phone. “What are you trying to make?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth.<br/>Closed it.</p><p>Then tried again, slower. “Something …comforting. But not heavy. Something warm. Familiar. Something that doesn’t feel like I’m trying too hard.” She grimaced. “Something that says… I give a shit about you, without making a big deal out of it.”</p><p>Lilia studied her for a long moment.</p><p>Not the stove. </p><p>Not the ingredients. </p><p>Agatha.</p><p>“Oh,” Lilia said softly.</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders tensed. “Don’t.”</p><p>“I didn’t say anything,” Lilia replied serenely.</p><p>“You were about to.”</p><p>“I was about to help,” Lilia said, reaching for the pot on the stove and giving it a thoughtful tap. “You’re overthinking because this matters. That’s not a crime.”</p><p>Agatha looked away, jaw tight. “She’s been through enough. I don’t want to overwhelm her.”</p><p>“And you won’t,” Lilia said. “Because you’re not cooking to impress. You’re cooking to take care.”</p><p>She moved toward the pantry, already reaching for ingredients. “When you were sixteen and came home exhausted and pretending you weren’t scared of the world, what did I make?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even have to think. “Chicken soup.”</p><p>“With lemon,” Lilia added. “And rice. And plenty of garlic.”</p><p>Agatha huffed despite herself. “You always put too much garlic.”</p><p>“Blasphemy, there is no such thing. And you always finished the bowl,” Lilia said, glancing back at her. “Because it felt like home.”</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest softened, just a little.</p><p>“But we’ll adjust,” Lilia continued, practical now. “Less salt. Easy to eat. Gentle on the stomach. And we’ll make it together so you stop spiralling.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Together?”</p><p>Lilia smiled, knowing and warm. “Yes, together. You don’t have to do everything alone, Agatha. Even now.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, then nodded once. “Okay.”</p><p>They worked side by side, Lilia chopping with ease, Agatha stirring and tasting and asking questions she hadn’t asked anyone in years. </p><p>The kitchen filled with the scent of garlic and simmering broth, the quiet punctuated by small, easy instructions and the clink of utensils.</p><p>It felt… steady.</p><p>Halfway through, Agatha murmured, almost to herself, “I just want her to feel safe here.”</p><p>Lilia didn’t tease this time.</p><p>She simply said, “She already does.”</p><p>As Agatha stood at the stove, stirring slowly, for a moment she let herself really notice what her life felt like right now.</p><p>The kitchen was warm, the windows fogged slightly from the pot simmering on the stove. Lilia moved beside her with quiet confidence, passing her chopped vegetables without comment, humming under her breath like this was the most natural thing in the world. </p><p>She hadn’t cooked like this in years. Not with intention. Not with company. Meals had been fuel, something grabbed between shifts or forgotten entirely. But now she was here, sleeves rolled up, listening to Lilia explain—again—why you always add the rice later, not earlier, and she felt… lighter.</p><p>Not unburdened. Not healed. Just lighter.</p><p>It surprised her.</p><p>A few weeks ago her world had been rigid, controlled, narrowed to work and walls and survival. She’d been running on adrenaline and habit, telling herself that staying busy was the same thing as staying okay. And now—now she was standing in her kitchen humming, cooking soup with Lilia, thinking about the woman upstairs who would be eating it soon.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>The thought of her sent a quiet warmth through Agatha’s chest. Not the sharp, frantic kind she’d known before, but something steadier. </p><p>Rio was here. Not somewhere dangerous, not a text unanswered, not a presence she was trying not to want. </p><p>She was upstairs, resting, close enough that Agatha could hear her if she called out.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, Rio wasn’t going anywhere.</p><p>And neither was Agatha.</p><p>The realisation settled slowly, almost reverently. There was no running to the hospital, no retreat into work, no carefully constructed distance to hide behind. </p><p>Just this house. This kitchen. This moment. This choice to stay.</p><p>Agatha stirred the pot again, watching the steam rise, and felt a strange, unfamiliar ease in her chest. The urge to flee wasn’t there. The need to brace herself wasn’t there either.</p><p>She was allowed to pause.</p><p>She was allowed to be held in place by warmth and care and quiet routines.</p><p>Lilia glanced at her, catching the soft, faraway look on her face. “You’re thinking too much,” she said gently.</p><p>Agatha huffed a small laugh. “Probably.”</p><p>But she didn’t pull away from the feeling this time.</p><p>She let herself stand there, cooking and breathing and being exactly where she was, knowing that upstairs Rio was resting, healing, and that for once in her life, Agatha wasn’t planning her next escape.</p><p>She was just staying.</p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha and Lilia were just finishing up in the kitchen.</p><p>The soup was off the heat, the burner clicked low, and steam curled lazily toward the ceiling as Lilia reached for a lid. Agatha wiped her hands on a dish towel, feeling oddly content, grounded in the quiet rhythm of the moment.</p><p>Then—<br/><strong>Thump</strong>.</p><p>The sound came from upstairs.</p><p>It was solid. Heavy. Wrong.</p><p>Agatha’s heart leapt straight into her throat.</p><p>She and Lilia looked at each other in unison.</p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for comment or permission. The towel slipped from her fingers as she bolted for the stairs, panic flaring sharp and immediate.</p><p>“Rio?!”</p><p>She shoved the door open without knocking, breath coming fast, braced for something terrible.<br/>What she found stopped her short.</p><p>Rio was standing in the middle of the room, half twisted, one arm awkwardly trapped in the sleeve of a sweatshirt, the fabric bunched up around her shoulder and neck. Her sling was caught at an angle that clearly wasn’t helping, and her backpack lay abandoned on the floor by the bed like evidence of a poorly planned escape attempt.</p><p>She looked… mortified.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, cheeks pink, eyes flicking up guiltily. “Hey. Um. Sorry. I could maybe use a little help? I didn’t want to bother anyone.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her for a heartbeat.</p><p>Then relief crashed through her so hard her knees nearly buckled.</p><p>She let out a shaky breath and couldn’t help the small, fond smile that tugged at her mouth. The adrenaline drained, leaving behind something warm and dizzying as she took in the sight of Rio like this. Vulnerable. Flustered. Standing in her house, wearing her care like a badly fitted sweatshirt.</p><p>“You scared me,” Agatha said, voice softer than the words suggested.</p><p>“I know,” Rio winced. “I’m sorry. I thought I could manage.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head and stepped closer, already reaching for her. “You’re not bothering anyone,” she said gently. “That’s literally why you’re here. So you don’t try to do things like wrestle with gravity and clothing at the same time.”</p><p>Rio huffed a quiet laugh, eyes flicking down. “Fair.”</p><p>“Come here,” Agatha said, the command gentle but firm.</p><p>She moved into Rio’s space without hesitation, fingers brushing warm skin as she carefully untangled fabric from sling and shoulder. Her touch was practiced, attentive, but there was something else threaded through it now. </p><p>Awareness. Want.</p><p>Helping Rio this close made Agatha painfully conscious of everything. The warmth of her body. The way she smelled faintly of soap and antiseptic and something uniquely Rio. The way her breath hitched every time Agatha’s fingers skimmed a sensitive spot.</p><p>She slid the sweatshirt over Rio’s head slowly, mindful of the injury, murmuring soft instructions as she worked. Rio followed them easily, trusting her completely, even when she winced.</p><p>“Easy,” Agatha murmured, hands steady as she guided Rio’s arm into the sleeve. “Almost there.”</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath through her teeth but didn’t pull away. “Okay. Okay.”</p><p>The sweatshirt finally settled into place, and Agatha’s hands lingered longer than strictly necessary, smoothing the fabric over Rio’s shoulder, adjusting the sling properly. She noticed every flinch, every shallow breath, cataloguing them automatically.</p><p>“It’s almost time for your pain meds,” Agatha said quietly. “What’s your pain scale?”</p><p>She lifted her hand without thinking, cupping Rio’s cheek with careful tenderness. Her thumb brushed lightly along her jaw as she looked into her eyes, really looked.</p><p>Brown. Warm. Soft around the edges despite everything.</p><p>Rio melted into the touch like it was the most natural thing in the world. Her shoulders relaxed, her breathing slowed, and her gaze dropped—briefly—to Agatha’s lips before flicking back up again.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said softly, a lopsided smile breaking across her face. “Um. Maybe a… six? But it’s a better six now.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat went dry.</p><p>The proximity did something dangerous to her. Want pooled low and insistent, sharp and aching, tempered only by the careful way she kept herself still. She wanted Rio with an intensity that startled her, wanted to close the distance and kiss that stupid, beautiful smile right off her face.</p><p>Instead, she swallowed and smiled faintly, thumb still warm against Rio’s cheek. “Good,” she said, voice steadier than she felt. “We’ll keep it from climbing.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened, her voice quieter when she said, “I’m really glad I'm here.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t trust herself to answer right away.</p><p>Because the truth was loud in her chest.</p><p>She didn’t just want Rio safe.</p><p>She wanted her close. Wanted her here. Wanted this tenderness, this domestic stillness, this slow unfolding of care and desire, to stretch on as long as possible.</p><p>So she simply nodded, leaning just close enough that Rio could feel her warmth, and said, “Me too.”</p><p>Agatha closed the distance before she could overthink it.</p><p>Before the old instincts could rise up and tell her to be careful, to pull back, to protect herself from wanting too much.</p><p>She pushed past all of it.</p><p>Her hand was still warm against Rio’s cheek, thumb resting just beneath her ear, and she let herself lean in. Slowly. Deliberately. Giving Rio time to pull away if she wanted to.</p><p>Rio didn’t.</p><p>Agatha kissed her softly.</p><p>It wasn’t hurried or desperate. There was no sharp edge to it, no rush to take more than was being offered. It was gentle and lingering, the kind of kiss that came from choosing instead of reaching. From staying instead of running.</p><p>Agatha felt it everywhere.</p><p>In the way her chest loosened, like she’d been holding her breath for years and was only just now realising it. In the quiet hum under her skin, warmth spreading outward instead of burning too fast. In the steadiness of her hands, which didn’t shake the way she’d half expected them to.</p><p>This was what she wanted.</p><p>Not distraction. </p><p>Not escape. </p><p>Not something to numb the fear.</p><p>This.</p><p>Rio’s lips were warm and responsive, soft but sure, and when she breathed out quietly against Agatha’s mouth, something deep inside Agatha settled into place. </p><p>The kiss held everything she hadn’t known how to say.<em> I’m here. I choose this. I’m not leaving.</em></p><p>Her doubts tried to surface, faint and distant. The what-ifs. The fear of loving and losing. The instinct to retreat before it hurt.</p><p>But they didn’t win.</p><p>Because right now, Rio was here. Leaning into her with trust written into every breath. And Agatha was tried of living her life like she had to anticipate the ending instead of allowing herself the middle.</p><p>She let the kiss linger another heartbeat before pulling back just enough to rest her forehead against Rio’s, eyes still closed.</p><p>Her heart was racing, but it wasn’t panic.</p><p>It was relief.<br/>It was desire, slow and aching and safe.<br/>It was the quiet, steady certainty of finally doing what she wanted instead of what fear had trained her to do.</p><p>Agatha opened her eyes and met Rio’s gaze, breath a little unsteady but her voice calm when she finally spoke.</p><p>“God, I missed kissing you,” Agatha admitted quietly.</p><p>The words slipped out before she could second-guess them. Heat rushed to her cheeks the moment they landed, and she dropped her gaze for half a second before forcing herself to look back up. </p><p>Rio’s eyes were unfocused in that particular way that came from exhaustion and pain meds and affection all tangled together. She looked a little drunk on the moment, on Agatha, and it made Agatha’s chest tighten.</p><p>Rio didn’t say anything at first. She just smiled—slow, soft, unguarded.</p><p>Agatha snorted under her breath, unable to help herself, and leaned in, resting her head against Rio’s uninjured shoulder. The contact was immediate comfort. Rio shifted instinctively, her good arm sliding more securely around Agatha’s waist, pulling her closer like it was the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>Even with one arm in a sling, even bruised and broken, there was still that quiet strength in Rio’s body. <br/>Solid. Grounding. The kind that didn’t announce itself but held you anyway. Agatha felt it in the way Rio’s arm stayed steady at her back, in the warmth of her chest beneath Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>“I missed you,” Rio murmured, her voice low and earnest, pressed into Agatha’s hair.</p><p>The simplicity of it hit harder than anything else could have.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head up slowly, heart pounding hard enough it felt unsteady in her ribs. She met Rio’s gaze, close enough now to see every flicker of emotion in her eyes. There were a thousand things she wanted to say—apologies, explanations, confessions—but her mouth opened and nothing came out.</p><p>Before she could find the words, Rio’s stomach growled loudly.</p><p>They both froze.</p><p>Then Rio groaned. “Mierda.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, startled and genuine, the sound breaking through the tension like sunlight. “Wow,” she said, smiling despite herself. “Timing.”</p><p>Rio groaned again, covering her face with her good hand. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>“Don’t be,” Agatha said softly, still smiling. “It’s kind of adorable.”</p><p>She eased back just enough to give Rio space, though she kept her hand resting on Rio’s forearm, thumb brushing lightly over warm skin. She didn’t want to let go entirely.</p><p>“I made soup if you’re hungry?” Agatha offered, her voice gentle now, careful in the way that came from wanting to take care.</p><p>Rio blinked down at her. “You cooked?”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow in mock offence. “Yes, Vidal. I can actually make my way around a kitchen.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, something warm and fond settling into her expression. “Did Lilia help?”</p><p>Agatha chewed her lip, eyes flicking away for just a moment, the faintest blush creeping back into her cheeks.</p><p>Rio laughed quietly. “Thought so.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, but she was smiling too, heart light in a way that felt unfamiliar and dangerously welcome.</p><p>Agatha led Rio downstairs slowly, their fingers laced together in an easy, unspoken way that felt worlds away from the careful distance she used to keep between herself and everyone else. She was aware of Lilia’s presence in the kitchen, of the inevitable look that would follow, but for once she didn’t brace herself for it.</p><p>She didn’t care.</p><p>Rio’s hand was warm and steady in hers, grounding her with every step. The quiet pressure of her thumb brushing over Agatha’s knuckles sent a calm through her that nothing else ever had.<br/> <br/>This was all she wanted in this moment. This closeness. This simple, domestic tenderness. Everything else could wait.</p><p>When they reached the kitchen, Agatha pulled out a chair for Rio without thinking, guiding her gently into it. She moved with the ease of someone who had already decided this was her place to be. She tucked a pillow carefully behind Rio’s back, adjusting it until she was sure there was no strain on her ribs or shoulder. Rio watched her the whole time, eyes soft, lips curved in a small, grateful smile that made Agatha’s chest feel dangerously full.</p><p>“There,” Agatha murmured, hands lingering for a second too long at Rio’s back before she stepped away.</p><p>“How are you feeling, dear?” Lilia asked, her tone warm and genuinely curious.</p><p>Rio turned her head, clearly torn between answering Lilia and continuing to stare at Agatha like she was the only thing in the room. “Oh—uh,” she said, blinking once, then smiling sheepishly. “Better now, thanks, Lilia.”</p><p>Lilia hummed, a sound that held far too much meaning, and flicked her gaze briefly toward Agatha. “Mhm.”</p><p>Agatha caught the look and felt her ears warm, a familiar flush creeping up her neck. Instinct told her to step back, to smooth her expression into something neutral and untouchable. But she didn’t.</p><p>Instead, she moved closer to Rio’s side, resting a hand lightly on the back of her chair. The contact was casual, unclaimed, but it anchored her all the same. If Lilia was smug about it, so be it. Agatha had spent too long pretending not to want things.</p><p>Lilia busied herself at the stove, ladling soup into bowls with the ease of long practice. The kitchen filled with the comforting clink of ceramic and the warm, rich smell of garlic and lemon. Agatha sliced the bread into thick pieces, her movements steady, deliberate, the simple act oddly soothing.</p><p>She set a bowl in front of Rio first.</p><p>Rio lifted the spoon carefully, blew on it once out of habit, then took a bite.</p><p>She froze.</p><p>Then she let out a soft, entirely unfiltered sound that was dangerously close to a moan.</p><p>Agatha startled, then laughed under her breath. “Wow.”</p><p>Rio blinked, looking a little embarrassed but completely sincere. “I’m sorry, I just—this is incredible.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved into a pleased, almost shy smile. “Told you.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes sparkled as she glanced up at her. “You are full of surprises, Harkness.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t let her fool you,” Lilia said cheerfully as she sat down with her own bowl. “I’ve been trying to teach her how to cook since she was sixteen. She was never interested. Too busy with her head in a book.”</p><p>“That tracks,” Rio said easily, grinning.</p><p>Agatha groaned. “Let’s not do the trip down memory lane right now, please.”</p><p>“Oh no,” Rio said, immediately delighted. “Let’s. I want to hear about bookworm teenage Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a look. “You’re injured. Don’t push your luck.”</p><p>Lilia smiled like she’d been waiting for this exact moment for years. She set her spoon down, eyes twinkling. “She used to read under the covers with a flashlight,” she began. “Wouldn’t sleep unless she’d finished just one more chapter.”</p><p>“Lilia,” Agatha protested, already covering her face with both hands.</p><p>“And she wore the same oversized cardigan every day,” Lilia continued. “Refused to part with it. Said it made her look ‘serious.’”</p><p>Rio laughed, bright and warm, her shoulders shaking. “That is adorable.”</p><p>“It was not adorable,” Agatha muttered from behind her hands. “It was comfortable.”</p><p>Lilia waved her off gently. “You were awkward. Brilliant. So earnest it hurt.”</p><p>Rio leaned back slightly in her chair, turning just enough to look at Agatha, her smile softening. “I wish I’d known her.”</p><p>Agatha peeked through her fingers, heart doing something strange and tight. “You know her now.”</p><p>Lilia’s laughter faded into something fond as she watched them, the two of them bent toward each other over soup and stories and warmth. The kitchen felt fuller somehow, louder with life than it had in years.</p><p>Agatha dropped her hands at last, cheeks flushed but eyes bright. She reached for her spoon, finally sitting down.</p><p>And despite herself, she laughed along.</p><p>They finished the soup slowly, the moment stretching into something quiet and almost reverent. Rio ate with obvious enjoyment, every spoonful grounding Agatha further in the simple, astonishing truth that she was here with her.</p><p>Agatha watched her more than she meant to. The careful way Rio shifted in her chair. The tiny, restrained wince when she moved her arm. The fatigue she tried to hide behind humour. She looked smaller somehow, contained by injury and exhaustion, and it pulled something sharp and protective tight in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>When Rio finally leaned back with a soft sigh of satisfaction, Agatha was already reaching for the pill bottle she’d set aside, the motion automatic.</p><p>“Okay,” she said gently. “Pain meds. You’ve eaten enough.”</p><p>Rio took them without complaint, washing them down obediently. “You’re very… thorough,” she teased lightly.</p><p>Agatha met her eyes. <em>Because I almost lost you</em>, she thought, but didn’t say. Instead she nodded once. <br/>“You were nearly crushed by a building. I’m allowed to fuss.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened, something warm and open flickering there, and Agatha had to look away briefly just to steady herself. Being looked at like that still felt dangerous. Too much. Everything.</p><p>“The couch,” Agatha decided, already standing. “You’ll be more comfortable.”</p><p>Rio rose carefully, and Agatha hovered close without thinking, her hand settling at Rio’s elbow when she wobbled just slightly. The contact sent a quiet jolt through her—relief tangled with fear.</p><p>Agatha guided her to the couch, acutely aware of every step. She arranged pillows with almost surgical precision—one behind Rio’s back, one supporting her arm, another adjusted because it didn’t look right yet. She told herself it was practical. Necessary.</p><p>But it wasn’t just that.</p><p>Rio watched her with a fond, amused little smile. “You’re hovering.”</p><p>Agatha paused, hands stilling. Then she looked at Rio, really looked at her, and said quietly, “You once said you were trained to catch me.” A beat. “Now it’s my turn.”</p><p>For a moment, Rio just stared at her.</p><p>Not teasing. </p><p>Not joking. </p><p>Just… stunned.</p><p>Something in her expression shifted, eyes going wide and soft all at once, like the weight of that landed somewhere deep. “Wow,” she breathed, almost reverent. “Okay. Yeah. I—cant believe you remembered that.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, suddenly aware of how exposed that admission had been, but she didn’t take it back.</p><p>She simply sat beside Rio, not too close but close enough that their thighs brushed, close enough to feel Rio’s warmth, her steady breathing.</p><p>Rio leaned subtly toward her, voice low. “You’re very serious about this.”</p><p>Agatha turned to her, expression gentler than she was used to letting anyone see. “Someone has to be.”</p><p>Lilia appeared then with a bottle of red wine and three glasses, breaking the moment just enough.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said immediately. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>Lilia raised a brow. “Relax. It’s not for Rio.”</p><p>“You’re supposed to be resting,” Agatha shot back. “And alcohol—”</p><p>“Red wine is good for the heart,” Lilia replied serenely, pouring anyway.</p><p>Agatha crossed her arms. “In moderation.”</p><p>Lilia smiled like she’d won. “Exactly.”</p><p>She handed Agatha a glass and sat down, entirely unbothered.</p><p>Agatha accepted it on reflex, then immediately froze, the stem cool between her fingers. She glanced sideways at Rio, guilt flashing across her face like she’d been caught doing something terribly unprofessional.</p><p>Rio noticed, of course. She always did.</p><p>“Oh no,” Rio murmured, lips twtching. “Don’t give me that look.”</p><p>Agatha lowered her voice. “You’re on pain meds.”</p><p>“And you’ve been awake for… what, twenty-eight hours?” Rio countered gently. “Indulge a little. God knows you need it.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated, still unconvinced.</p><p>Rio leaned in closer, voice dropping conspiratorially. “Besides,” she added, eyes sparkling, “give it twenty minutes and these meds are going to have me on the same level of buzz anyway. We’ll be even.”</p><p>Agatha snorted despite herself, tension loosening in her shoulders. She lifted the glass and took a careful sip, the warmth of the wine spreading through her chest in a way that felt almost medicinal.</p><p>Lilia watched the exchange with open satisfaction.</p><p>She took a slow sip of her wine, eyes flicking between them before she spoke, voice warm and entirely too knowing. “It’s nice,” she said, almost casually, “seeing the two of you like this. Getting along. Settled.”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on her sip.</p><p>“Lilia” she muttered, cheeks heating instantly.</p><p>Rio, on the other hand, ducked her head with a shy smile, the tips of her ears pinking in a way Agatha found deeply unfair. She glanced up at Agatha through her lashes, clearly pleased, clearly trying not to show it.</p><p>Lilia smiled wider, utterly unrepentant. “What? I have eyes.”</p><p>Agatha pressed her lips together, resolutely staring into her glass. Rio shifted slightly closer, her good shoulder brushing Agatha’s arm in quiet solidarity.</p><p>After a beat, Lilia’s expression softened. The teasing gave way to something gentler, more earnest. She turned her full attention to Rio.</p><p>“You don’t have to answer this if you don’t want to,” she said to Rio, voice warm and sincere. “But… what was it like? Being trapped in there? You must have been terrified.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched before she could stop it.</p><p>Her fingers curled instinctively against the couch cushion, knuckles whitening. She hadn’t realised how tightly she’d been holding herself together until that moment. Part of her wanted to shut the conversation down immediately, to protect Rio from having to relive it, and maybe to protect herself from hearing it spoken aloud.</p><p>Rio went quiet.</p><p>Agatha watched her closely now, every muscle in her body tuned to Rio’s slightest shift. She saw the way Rio inhaled slowly, the way her jaw tightened just a bit, as if bracing herself. Agatha’s chest ached with a helpless, useless need to fix something that had already happened.</p><p>“It was loud,” Rio said finally, eyes fixed somewhere ahead. “At first. Everything’s just noise and heat and adrenaline. You don’t really feel scared right away. You’re trained not to.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. She hated that training had taught Rio to push fear aside. Hated that it was necessary.<br/>“But when the comms went dead,” Rio continued, voice quieter now, “and I couldn’t hear anyone anymore… that’s when it hit.”</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened painfully. She remembered standing outside that burning building, the radio silent, the look on Steve’s face when no one replied through the radio. The memory slammed into her with brutal clarity.</p><p>“That part,” Rio admitted, “was terrifying.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, sharp and silent.</p><p>Rio felt it. She turned her head slightly, meeting Agatha’s eyes, her expression gentling. “But I also knew I wasn’t alone,” she added. “Even down there.”</p><p>Agatha felt the words like a physical blow. Her eyes burned, and she blinked fast, refusing to let tears spill in front of either of them. She told herself, fiercely, that Rio was here. That she was alive. That this was not the same as Boston. Not the same as Nicky. Not another loss.</p><p>But fear didn’t listen to reason.</p><p>She frowned faintly. “You didn’t know where we were,” she said, unable to help herself.</p><p>Rio turned toward her then, fully, brown eyes softening. “I didn’t need to. I knew you’d be pacing a hole in the ground somewhere,” she said with a faint smile.</p><p>The words landed gently and devastatingly all at once. Agatha’s chest tightened, something warm and fragile blooming behind her ribs. She felt suddenly, overwhelmingly exposed. Seen in a way that didn’t feel dangerous, just… true.</p><p>Lilia hummed fondly. “That sounds about right.”</p><p>Agatha huffed weakly, but she couldn’t look away from Rio now.</p><p>Rio leaned back carefully against the couch, exhaustion evident but her voice steady. “I kept telling myself I wasn’t done yet. That I still had things to come back to.”</p><p>Her gaze flicked back to Agatha, lingering this time.</p><p>Agatha’s heart stuttered.</p><p>“And,” Rio added softly, “turns out I was right.”</p><p>Something inside Agatha cracked open.</p><p>She didn’t trust her voice. Instead, she reached out and took Rio’s hand, her grip firm, grounding, a silent promise she hadn’t yet found the courage to say aloud. Her thumb brushed gently over Rio’s knuckles, as if reassuring herself that she was real, that she was here.</p><p>Rio squeezed back.</p><p>Lilia noticed, of course. She always did. But she didn’t say a word.</p><p>Agatha sat there, holding Rio’s hand, her chest full and aching and terrifyingly alive, realising with quiet certainty that this was what staying felt like.</p><p>A couple of hours later, the house had settled into a softer, quieter rhythm.</p><p>The wine was half gone. The soup bowls had been cleared. The living room lights were dimmed low, casting warm pools of amber across the floor. Rio was slumped comfortably into the couch cushions, head tipped back, eyes heavy-lidded and unfocused, her good hand loosely curled in the blanket Agatha had draped over her without thinking.</p><p>She yawned, long and unguarded, blinking slowly afterward like the world was lagging half a second behind her.</p><p>Agatha noticed immediately.</p><p>She always did.</p><p>“You’re fading,” Agatha said gently, setting her glass aside. There was fondness in her voice, but also the familiar clinical awareness humming just beneath it. Pain meds plus adrenaline crash plus trauma equaled exhaustion. Her brain ticked through it automatically.</p><p>Rio smiled lazily at her. “Am not,” she murmured, even as her eyes slid closed for a beat too long.</p><p>Lilia watched the exchange with quiet amusement before standing. “Alright,” she declared kindly. “That’s my cue. Bedtime for the injured one.”</p><p>Rio sighed, but she didn’t argue. She shifted carefully, wincing just slightly as she stood, and Agatha was instantly there, one hand steadying her elbow, the other hovering near her back without quite touching, ready in case she faltered.</p><p>The closeness made Agatha acutely aware of everything. Rio’s warmth. The faint scent of earth and soap clinging to her skin. The way she leaned into Agatha without even thinking about it.</p><p>They moved slowly up the stairs, step by careful step. Agatha kept her pace deliberately measured, murmuring soft reminders—“Easy,” “I’ve got you,” “Tell me if anything hurts”—even though Rio was mostly just humming tiredly in response.</p><p>Inside the guest room, Agatha switched on the bedside lamp, bathing the space in soft light. She helped Rio shrug out of her hoodie, careful around the sling, then hesitated for half a second before asking, “Do you want help changing, or…?”</p><p>Rio smiled sleepily. “Help. Please.”</p><p>The word please did something unfair to Agatha’s resolve.</p><p>She turned away just enough to give Rio space, handing her a soft t-shirt and a pair of boxers from her discarded backpack, then stepped back in when Rio struggled, fingers clumsy and slow with fatigue. Agatha moved carefully, methodically, her hands gentle as she helped guide the fabric over Rio’s shoulders, down her arms.</p><p>When Rio stepped out of her sweats, Agatha’s breath caught before she could stop it.</p><p>Her gaze lingered, traitorously, on the strong line of Rio’s thigh. The muscle there was lean and defined, still marked faintly with scratches and a blooming bruise. Proof of strength. Proof of survival.</p><p>Heat curled low in Agatha’s stomach, sharp and unexpected, and she had to look away before it showed. She swallowed, steadying herself, reminding her brain that this was not the time. That Rio was injured. </p><p>That Rio needed care, not want.</p><p>God, she wanted her anyway.</p><p>Once Rio was changed, Agatha guided her gently to the bed, helping her sit, then easing her back against the pillows. She tugged the duvet up around her with practiced tenderness, tucking the edges in just so.</p><p>“There,” Agatha murmured. “Try to sleep.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes were already half-closed. “You’re very… bossy,” she said again, voice thick and drowsy.</p><p>Agatha smiled despite herself. “You’ll live.”</p><p>“Didn't say I didn't like it,” Rio mumbled.</p><p>Agatha brushed a curl off Rio’s forehead, her touch lingering for just a heartbeat longer than necessary. </p><p>“I’ll probably be gone by the time you wake up,” she said quietly. “I have an early shift.”</p><p>Rio frowned faintly, as much as her tired face would allow. “Don’t want you to go.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened. “I know.”</p><p>She straightened, preparing to step back—<br/>And then Rio reached out with her good hand, fingers curling weakly into the sleeve of Agatha’s shirt.</p><p>“Stay,” she murmured. Her eyes fluttered open just enough to look at Agatha properly, brown and soft and devastatingly earnest. “Please? Just… lie with me.”</p><p>Agatha hesitated.</p><p>Her mind filled instantly with a dozen concerns. Rio’s injuries. The sling. The risk of jostling her shoulder or arm. The fact that Agatha wasn’t sure she trusted herself this close to her, not when her body was still humming with want and relief and something dangerously close to love.</p><p>“I don’t want to hurt you,” Agatha said softly, even as her resolve wavered.</p><p>Rio’s grip tightened just a fraction. She looked up at Agatha through her lashes, eyes warm and pleading in a way that should have been illegal. “You won’t.”</p><p>That look broke her.</p><p>Agatha bit her lip, exhaled slowly, then nodded. “Alright. But I’m not moving.”</p><p>“Deal,” Rio murmured, already drifting.</p><p>Agatha slipped out of her shoes and carefully climbed onto the bed, easing herself under the duvet beside Rio. She lay on her side, careful to keep her movements controlled, one arm hovering uncertainly before Rio shifted closer on her own, tucking her head against Agatha’s shoulder with a quiet sigh.</p><p>Agatha froze for a heartbeat.</p><p>Then she wrapped her arm around Rio, light but protective, her hand resting between Rio’s shoulder blades. Rio’s breathing evened out almost immediately.</p><p>Agatha lay there for a long moment, listening to the quiet rhythm of Rio’s breathing deepen and slow. Each inhale, each exhale, was steady and warm against her side, a small miracle she still didn’t quite trust. Her arm stayed where it was, protective without pressure, as if some part of her believed that if she loosened her hold even slightly, the world might find a way to take Rio back.</p><p>Her heart refused to calm. It beat hard and fast, thudding in her chest like it had something urgent to say.</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p>She had faced operating rooms filled with blood, held lives in her hands, made decisions that carried permanent consequences. And yet this—this felt bigger. More dangerous. More honest.</p><p>Her gaze drifted to Rio’s face, softened in sleep. No guarded smile. No teasing warmth. Just Rio, unarmored, trusting her enough to sleep like this.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened.</p><p>She told herself she didn’t need to say it. That Rio couldn’t hear her anyway, dulled by pain medication and exhaustion. That it could stay tucked safely inside, unnamed and contained, like she’d done for so long.</p><p>But the words pressed against her ribs, insistent.</p><p>And for once, Agatha didn’t push them back.</p><p>“I love you,” she whispered into the quiet, her voice barely more than breath.</p><p>Saying it out loud felt like stepping off a ledge she’d been circling her whole life. </p><p>Terrifying. <br/>Exhilarating. <br/>Real. </p><p>Her chest ached immediately after, like something long-held had finally been released and didn’t know where to go next.</p><p>She let out a shaky breath and rested her cheek lightly against Rio’s hair.</p><p>“I don’t know how to do this perfectly,” she murmured, softer still. “But I want to try. I want… you.”</p><p>Rio didn’t stir. Her breathing stayed even, peaceful, utterly unaware of the seismic shift that had just taken place inches away.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, the tension slowly bleeding from her shoulders. Whatever tomorrow brought—work, fear, healing, conversations she’d been avoiding—she would face it differently now.</p><p>She had said the words.</p><p>And for the first time, instead of fear tightening around her heart, Agatha felt something like hope settle there instead.</p><p> </p>

<p>Rio woke slowly, the way she always did now, surfacing through layers of warmth and ache and fog. For a few seconds she lay still, blinking at the ceiling, letting her mind catch up with her body. The room wasn’t hers. The light felt different. Softer.</p><p>Then it clicked.<br/>Lilia’s house.<br/>Which meant—Agatha.</p><p>The realisation settled gently in her chest, warm and grounding. She turned her head instinctively, careful of her arm, half-expecting to find Agatha there beside her like she had been when Rio finally drifted off the night before.</p><p>The space was empty.</p><p>Rio’s smile tugged at her lips anyway. Of course it was. Agatha would have already left for the hospital, probably before dawn, trying not to wake her, trying to do everything right. That thought alone made something fond and achy bloom in Rio’s chest.</p><p>She shifted just enough to slide her hand over the sheets where Agatha had been. The fabric was cool now, but not entirely. There was still the faintest impression of warmth, and beneath it, the lingering scent of lavender.</p><p>Rio inhaled softly.</p><p>Agatha’s shampoo.</p><p>It clung to the pillow, subtle but unmistakable, and Rio let her eyes close for a moment as she breathed it in. Somewhere along the way, it had become her favourite smell without her even realising it. Comforting. Familiar. Safe.</p><p>She’d noticed it every time Agatha moved, every time her hair brushed past Rio’s shoulder, that soft hint of lavender followed. It always soothed her, right down to her bones, like her body recognised Agatha before her mind could catch up.</p><p>Rio smiled to herself, slow and content.</p><p>Agatha had been here. Had chosen to be here.</p><p>And even in her absence, she still felt close.</p><p>Rio had known from the very first moment she met Agatha that something inside her had shifted, quietly but irrevocably. It wasn’t dramatic or loud, no thunderbolt or cinematic pause, just a subtle sense of something to come.</p><p>Rio had always been a romantic at heart. She believed in big feelings, in devotion, in the kind of love that settled deep and stayed. But she had never truly experienced it herself. She loved Alice, loved the guys at the firehouse with a fierce, loyal affection that came from shared danger and long nights and unspoken trust. That love was real and solid and necessary.</p><p>But it wasn’t <em>that</em> love.</p><p>What Rio had always wanted, what she had quietly carried with her since childhood, was the kind of love her parents had shared. The kind that made the world feel brighter just because the other person was in it. The kind that stole your breath and made your palms sweat and your heart race for no good reason at all. A fairytale love, she used to think, half-embarrassed by the word but unwilling to let go of it.</p><p>She had never found it.<br/>Not until Agatha.</p><p>The first time Agatha smiled at her—really smiled, not the sharp, guarded thing she wore like armour—Rio had felt it land squarely in her chest. Warm. Disarming. Dangerous in the best way. It wasn’t flirtation exactly. It was recognition. As if Agatha had looked at her and seen her, and in doing so, invited Rio closer without saying a word.</p><p>That was the moment Rio knew.</p><p>She was going to fall for this woman.<br/>Hard.<br/>Fast.<br/>And without any chance of stopping herself.</p><p>She could also tell almost immediately that Agatha was closed off, not in a cold or unkind way, but in the careful, deliberate way of someone who had learned that vulnerability came at a cost. Agatha carried herself with sharp edges and impeccable control, every word measured, every expression curated just enough to keep people at a distance. To most, it probably read as intimidating.</p><p>To Rio, it read as pain.</p><p>Beneath the precision and the biting wit, Rio could see something softer, something bruised and beautiful. A woman who had loved deeply once and paid dearly for it. A soul that ached in quiet, private ways, that kept moving forward because stopping would mean feeling too much all at once. And somehow, that didn’t scare Rio away.</p><p>If anything, it drew her closer.</p><p>There was something profoundly endearing about the way Agatha tried so hard to be unbreakable. About the way her guard slipped in small moments she didn’t even seem to notice. The warmth that peeked through when she thought no one was looking. The care she gave so freely to others while denying herself the same grace.</p><p>Rio understood that kind of hurt. She respected it.</p><p>So she didn’t push.<br/>She waited.</p><p>Rio knew that trust, real trust, couldn’t be demanded or rushed. It had to be earned, built slowly through consistency and presence. Through showing up. Through staying when things were uncomfortable. Through proving, again and again, that she wasn’t going anywhere.</p><p>And Rio was good at that.</p><p>She stayed. She listened. She learned the rhythm of Agatha’s silences, the way her shoulders tensed before she deflected with humour, the moments when her eyes softened just a fraction. She let Agatha set the pace, even when it meant waiting longer than she wanted to.</p><p>Because Rio was patient.</p><p>And because something deep in her knew that when Agatha finally did open her heart, it would be worth every moment of waiting.</p><p>A soft knock at the door pulled Rio from her thoughts.</p><p>“Rio, dear,” Lilia’s voice called through the heavy oak. “Are you awake?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat, shifting carefully against the pillows before answering, “Yeah, Lilia. Come on in.”</p><p>The door opened slowly, Lilia peeking in first before stepping fully into the room, her presence instantly calming. </p><p>“Good morning, sweetheart,” she said warmly. “I just wanted to check in and see if you needed help with anything.”</p><p>Rio pushed herself up a little more, wincing faintly as she adjusted. Her hair was a mess, eyes still heavy with sleep as she scrubbed at them with her good hand. “Thanks, Lilia,” she said honestly. “I think I’m okay. Just… moving slow.”</p><p>Lilia hummed, clearly unconvinced but not pressing. She raised an eyebrow, amusement dancing in her eyes. </p><p>“Well,” she added casually, “Agatha already called. Very clear instructions. You’re to eat something before taking your pain meds, and I’m to make sure you actually take them. And,” she paused, smiling wider, “she’ll likely call again to confirm I’ve done my job properly.”</p><p>The sound of Agatha’s name alone was enough to soften something in Rio’s chest. A small, unguarded smile tugged at her lips before she could stop it. The idea that Agatha had thought about her first thing in the morning, even in the middle of a busy hospital shift, wrapped around her like warmth.</p><p>Lilia noticed immediately.</p><p>She tilted her head, that knowing look settling comfortably into place. “Don’t look so surprised, kid,” she said gently. “When that girl cares about someone, she cares deeply.”</p><p>Rio’s smile lingered, a little shy now, a little awed. She looked down at her sheets, feeling that warmth spread, steady and reassuring.</p><p>“Yeah,” she murmured softly. “I’m starting to see that.”</p><p> </p><p>Once they made it downstairs, Rio barely had time to sit before negotiations began.</p><p>“Honestly Lilia,” she said, trying for earnest and reasonable as she eyed the kitchen counter, “toast is totally fine. One slice. Maybe two. Dry. I don’t usually even eat breakfast anywy.”</p><p>Lilia gave her a look that suggested Rio had just said something deeply foolish.</p><p>“Toast,” Lilia repeated slowly, already cracking eggs into a bowl, “is what you eat <em>with</em> breakfast, not instead of it.”</p><p>Rio opened her mouth to argue, then closed it again as Lilia moved with swift, decisive confidence—pan heating, bacon sizzling, hash browns sliding into the skillet. </p><p>The kitchen filled with the kind of smells that made resistance feel not only pointless, but cruel.</p><p>“This feels excessive,” Rio muttered, though her stomach betrayed her with a low, enthusiastic growl.</p><p>“Mhm,” Lilia hummed, not looking at her. “You need your strength if your going to heal.”</p><p>When the plate was finally set in front of her, Rio stared at it in awe. Thick slices of toast, eggs cooked just right, bacon crisp and glistening, hash browns golden and perfect. It was a <em>feast</em>.</p><p>She laughed softly, shaking her head. “I’m going to leave here with a bigger waistline and a deep emotional attachment to your kitchen.”</p><p>Lilia smiled serenely. “Good. That means I’m doing my job.”</p><p>Rio took a bite and nearly sighed. Warmth spread through her chest that had nothing to do with the food itself. This—being fed, being fussed over without expectation or debt—hit something tender in her.</p><p>It reminded her of her abuela.</p><p>Her abuela had been exactly like this. Food as care. Food as comfort. Food as a quiet insistence that you mattered, that you were worth the effort. If you were hurt, you ate. If you were tired, you ate. If life had been unkind, you ate, and she sat with you until the world felt a little less sharp.</p><p>Rio swallowed, blinking past the sudden sting behind her eyes.</p><p>“Yeah,” she murmured, more to herself than to Lilia. “Food was abuela’s love language too.”</p><p>Lilia glanced up, something gentle and knowing in her expression. “The best kind,” she said simply.</p><p>Rio nodded and took another bite, letting the warmth settle in her bones, thinking that maybe healing wasn’t just about rest and medication.</p><p>Maybe it was also about being fed.</p><p>Lilia looked at Rio with a quiet fondness that felt earned, not intrusive. She had a way of seeing straight through people without making them feel exposed.</p><p>“You miss her dearly,” Lilia said gently.</p><p>Rio’s smile tugged at one corner of her mouth, soft and a little sad. “Yeah,” she admitted. “She was the best.”</p><p>Lilia nodded, humming in acknowledgment, letting the weight of that truth settle between them. Then, after a moment, she tilted her head and asked, “Tell me something. What would your abuela do when you were sick or hurt as a child?”</p><p>Rio let out a small, breathy laugh, the kind that carried memory with it. “Oh,” she said, eyes drifting somewhere far away. “She made it an event.”</p><p>Lilia smiled, already knowing this would be good.</p><p>“She’d drag every duvet in the apartment into the living room and pile them on the couch like we were building a nest,” Rio continued, her voice warming as she spoke. “Didn’t matter if it was summer or winter. You were buried under blankets either way.”</p><p>She shifted slightly in her chair, careful of her arm, but her expression had softened completely now. “Then she’d make sancocho. Always sancocho. She swore it cured everything. Fever, flu, heartbreak. Probably broken bones too, if she’d had the chance.”</p><p>Lilia chuckled. “I believe it.”</p><p>“And while it simmered,” Rio went on, smiling to herself, “she’d put on these absolutely terrible telenovelas. I mean, truly unhinged. Dramatic gasps every thirty seconds, people coming back from the dead, secret twins. I didn’t understand half of it when I was little, but she’d narrate the important parts like it was a sporting event.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly, the sound fond and full. “We’d sit there all day, wrapped up together, me half asleep, her shushing me anytime I tried to complain. She’d say, ‘If you’re sick, you rest. That’s the rule.’”</p><p>Her smile dimmed just a touch, but it didn’t disappear. “It always made everything feel less scary. Like… as long as she was there, nothing bad could really happen.”</p><p>Lilia watched her carefully, her expression tender. </p><p>“That kind of love stays with you,” she said. “It doesn’t disappear when the person is gone. It becomes a blueprint. For what you look for. For what you give.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, the word settling deep in her chest. A pause stretched between them, weighted but not uncomfortable. Then Rio hesitated, clearly debating with herself, before finally speaking.</p><p>“Agatha didn’t really get that growing up, did she?” she asked carefully. “Not before you.”</p><p>Lilia’s breath caught—just slightly—but Rio noticed. Her eyes shimmered, the warmth in them edged now with something old and painful.</p><p>“No,” Lilia said softly. “She didn’t.”</p><p>She looked away for a moment, gathering herself, fingers pressing into the counter as if to anchor herself. When she spoke again, her voice was steadier, but the emotion beneath it was unmistakable.</p><p>“When she came to me, she was… a shell of a person,” Lilia said. “So quiet. So careful. A timid little thing who flinched at raised voices, at doors closing too hard. Always watching, always braced for something to go wrong.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened.</p><p>“I don’t know the full extent of what Evanora did,” Lilia continued, her jaw tightening at the name. “But I know enough to say she didn’t treat her well. Not at all.” She paused, swallowing hard. “That woman…”</p><p>Lilia fell silent for a beat, clearly working to steady her breathing, to school her expression into something manageable before continuing.</p><p>“I lived across the street from them for years,” she said. “I remember the first time I really met Agatha. She was ten. Standing on the front porch, shaking, hugging her backpack to her chest like it was the only thing keeping her upright.”</p><p>Rio felt something ache low and heavy in her ribs.</p><p>“She’d come home from school and the house was locked,” Lilia said quietly. “No note. No warning. Just… locked.” A faint, bitter smile touched her lips. “I invited her to wait at my place. Gave her a snack. Turned on the television. She sat so straight on the couch, like she was afraid to take up too much space.”</p><p>Lilia shook her head slowly. “After that, Evanora started asking me to watch her every now and then. ‘A few hours,’ she’d say. While she went out, God knows where.” Her voice wavered. “And I told myself I was helping. That it was enough.”</p><p>Her eyes were bright now, unshed tears pooling despite her efforts. “I wish I’d been braver,” she admitted. “I wish I’d seen it for what it was sooner. I wish I’d stepped in before that child was left on my doorstep with nothing but a suitcase and a look that said she’d already learned not to expect anyone to stay.”</p><p>Silence settled between them, heavy and reverent.</p><p>Rio didn’t speak right away. She couldn’t—not without risking her voice breaking. Instead, she reached out with her good hand and rested it gently over Lilia’s on the counter. It wasn’t dramatic. Just there. Steady.</p><p>“She found you,” Rio said softly at last. “And you stayed.”</p><p>Lilia’s eyes met hers, something raw and grateful flickering through them.<br/>“Yes,” she whispered. “I did.”</p><p>“I’ve known that girl most of her life,” Lilia said softly. “Long enough to recognise the smallest changes in her. The day she met you—” She paused, a faint, knowing smile touching her lips. “—that was the first time I noticed the spark.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>“It was subtle,” Lilia went on. “So small I might’ve missed it if I hadn’t been looking for it. But it was there. In her eyes. In the way she lingered just a second longer when your name came up. In the way she pretended not to care and then cared anyway.”</p><p>She shook her head fondly. “Agatha doesn’t give her love easily, Rio. She never has. For her, love has always come with risk, with loss. So she learned to keep it tightly controlled, carefully rationed. To offer pieces of herself only when she was sure they couldn’t be taken away.”</p><p>Lilia met Rio’s gaze fully now, her expression open and earnest. “But with you… it’s different. I can see her wanting. Wanting in a way she hasn’t let herself want in a very long time.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth fell open slightly at the admission, the words landing harder than she’d expected. For a moment, she could only stare, heart pounding, something fierce and protective rising in her chest.</p><p>Then her jaw set.</p><p>A quiet, determined resolve settled over her features—not loud, not dramatic, but steady. Certain.</p><p>“I know she’s scared,” Rio said finally, her voice low but unwavering. “I know she’s been hurt in ways she doesn’t talk about. And I don’t expect her to hand herself over to me.” She swallowed. “I don’t want her to.”</p><p>Lilia’s brow lifted slightly, intrigued.</p><p>“I just want her to know she doesn’t have to be alone anymore,” Rio continued. “That she doesn’t have to be perfect or controlled or unbreakable with me. I want to be someone she can rest with. Someone she can come apart around and still feel safe.”</p><p>She exhaled slowly, grounding herself. “I’m not in a hurry. I don’t need promises or grand gestures. I just—” Her voice softened. “I want to stay. However long it takes.”</p><p>Lilia studied her for a long moment, the way one does when weighing something precious. Then she smiled—small, satisfied, and deeply moved.</p><p>“That,” she said gently, “is exactly how you love someone like Agatha.”</p><p>Rio’s throat tightened. “I don’t want to be another thing she has to survive,” she admitted. “I want to be something she can keep.”</p><p>Lilia reached out then, resting her hand over Rio’s with quiet affection. “You already are,” she said simply. “She just hasn’t let herself say it yet.”</p><p>The words settled between them, heavy and hopeful all at once.</p><p>Rio nodded, blinking back emotion, a soft, almost reverent smile touching her lips. Somewhere deep inside her, the choice had already been made—but now it felt named, solidified.</p><p>“I won’t run,” Rio said quietly. “No matter how hard it gets.”</p><p>Lilia didn’t answer right away.</p><p>Instead, she reached out, her movements unhurried, deliberate. Her fingers brushed gently along Rio’s jaw before her palm settled against Rio’s cheek, warm and steady. The touch was maternal without being possessive, grounding without expectation—an echo of the kind of care that had shaped both of them in different ways.</p><p>Lilia’s thumb stroked lightly beneath Rio’s eye, a simple, tender gesture that made Rio’s chest tighten.<br/>“Good,” Lilia said softly. “Because neither will she. Not this time.”</p><p>Her hand lingered for a moment longer, as if committing the truth of it to memory, before she let it fall away.</p><p>Rio swallowed, blinking back the sudden sting of tears, her resolve only deepening under that quiet blessing. She nodded once, a small but absolute promise settling into place.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio had been trying very hard to be still.</p><p>It didn’t come naturally to her. It never had. Her body was used to motion, to purpose, to doing something—anything—that justified the space she took up in the world.</p><p>Lying low, resting, being waited on all felt wrong in a way she couldn’t quite articulate. Worse, it made her feel guilty. Like she was an imposition.</p><p>Especially here.</p><p>Especially with Lilia, who was still recovering herself and yet somehow insisted on fussing over Rio as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>So when Rio noticed the small trash bag sitting by the back door, tied neatly and clearly waiting to be taken out, it felt like a gift. A task. Something small enough to be safe, useful enough to matter.</p><p>She could do that.</p><p>Easing herself carefully off the chair, she moved slowly across the kitchen, conscious of every shift in her body. She reached for the bag, already bracing herself as she bent—just a little—<br/>A sharp voice cut through the room.</p><p>“And what do you think you’re doing?”</p><p>Rio froze mid-motion.</p><p>She glanced over her shoulder, caught red-handed. “Um,” she said, straightening slightly. “I was just going to take this outside. I can manage it.”</p><p>Lilia turned fully now, arms crossing, eyes narrowing in a way that would have been intimidating if it weren’t so clearly laced with concern.</p><p>“I see one flinch, Vidal,” Lilia said evenly, “and you are not leaving the couch for the rest of the day. Kapísh?”</p><p>Rio swallowed a smile. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>With exaggerated care, she lifted the bag with her good arm, keeping her movements slow and deliberate. She nudged the back door open with her shoulder and stepped outside, the late autumn air cool against her skin. It felt good—fresh, grounding.</p><p>She dropped the bag into the bin and paused, surveying the backyard. Fallen leaves littered the grass in gold and rust, and she found herself mentally cataloguing what would need to be done once she felt a little stronger. Raking. Tidying. Helping.</p><p><em>Soon</em>, she promised herself.</p><p>She turned back inside—and caught movement out of the corner of her eye.</p><p>Rio stilled.</p><p>Something small darted beneath the kitchen table.</p><p>Frowning slightly, she bent carefully and crouched, peering underneath.</p><p>A tiny black kitten stared back at her.</p><p>Wide-eyed. Perfectly still. Like it had been waiting to be discovered.</p><p>“…Uh,” Rio said slowly. “Lilia?”</p><p>“Yes, dear?” Lilia replied from the counter, the kettle already warming.</p><p>“I didn’t know you had a cat.”</p><p>Lilia turned at that, brows knitting in confusion. “What are you talking about? I don’t have a cat.”</p><p>Rio straightened, glancing between Lilia and the space beneath the table. “Then,” she said carefully, “why is there a cat under your table?”</p><p>Lilia turned, following Rio’s line of sight.</p><p>She blinked.</p><p>Then laughed softly. “Well, would you look at that,” she said, already lowering herself to the floor with surprising ease. “Aren’t you just a sweetheart?”</p><p>The kitten didn’t move as Lilia crouched, cooing gently, reaching out with practiced softness. It allowed itself to be scooped up without protest, a warm little bundle of black fur and curious eyes.</p><p>“It must’ve followed me in from outside,” Rio said, watching in mild disbelief.</p><p>Lilia cradled the kitten against her chest and peered down at it fondly. “Where’s your mama, hmm?”</p><p>They stepped back outside together, Lilia holding the kitten securely while Rio scanned the yard, calling softly, listening for any answering sound. They waited. Watched. Looked along the fence line, beneath the bushes.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>After a while, Lilia sighed, the sound resigned but not unhappy. “Well,” she said as they went back inside, “I suppose that settles it.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head. “Settles what?”</p><p>Lilia smiled, glancing down at the kitten. “I seem to have a habit of collecting strays.” She chuckled. </p><p>Rio smiled too, something warm and familiar blooming in her chest.</p><p>She had a feeling she’d just been added to that very list.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>Agatha had survived the day.</p><p>That, in itself, felt like a victory—small, hard-won, and more fragile than she cared to admit.</p><p>She moved through her hours on discipline and instinct alone, guided by muscle memory honed over years in trauma bays and operating rooms. Her hands were steady, precise. Her voice calm and authoritative. To anyone watching, she was exactly who she had always been- composed, brilliant, unshakeable.</p><p>But beneath the surface, her focus kept slipping.</p><p>Again and again, her thoughts drifted back to the woman she had left curled in bed that morning. Rio— warm, drowsy, hair a mess against the pillow, breathing slow and even in the way that finally told Agatha she was resting. Really resting. Safe.</p><p>The image followed her all day. In the quiet moments between cases. In the sterile hush before scrubbing in. In hallways she’d walked a thousand times before, now softened by the memory of Rio’s weight beside her, the careful way Agatha had eased out of bed before dawn because she couldn’t bring herself to wake her.</p><p>Each time her phone pinged with an update from Lilia, relief bloomed, followed by a soft, inconvenient ache in her chest. She checked it more often than necessary. Once or twice, she caught herself smiling at nothing at all.</p><p>She corrected it quickly.</p><p>Not quickly enough.</p><p>“So,” Jen said mid-afternoon, leaning against the nurses’ station with an unmistakable grin, “how’s life at home with your new live-in patient?”</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up.</p><p>“That,” she said coldly, “is none of your business.”</p><p>Jen blinked, then laughed. “Wow. Touchy.”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. She turned back to her chart, fingers resuming their steady rhythm on the keyboard, through her shoulders had gone rigid.</p><p>“Oh, relax,” Jen continued lightly. “Alice mentioned something interesting. Apparently Rio called you her girlfriend.”</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>Just for a fraction of a second.</p><p>Jen saw it and pounced. “I mean, I <em>was</em> going to ask if that was—”</p><p>“Yes, Jennifer.”</p><p>The interruption was calm. Clear. Unmistakable.</p><p>Jen stopped talking.</p><p>Agatha turned in her chair, meeting Jen’s gaze directly. There was no defensiveness in her expression now. No edge. Just certainty.</p><p>“Rio and I are… together,” she said evenly. “We care about one another very much.” Her voice didn’t waver. “And I would appreciate it if you kept out of our relationship.”</p><p>The nurses’ station went very, very quiet.</p><p>Jen stared at her.</p><p>Agatha waited.</p><p>“Well,” Jen said finally, clearly stunned, “that’s… new.”</p><p>Agatha inclined her head once. “It is.”</p><p>From a few steps away, Wanda—who had been pretending very hard not to listen—let a small, proud smile curve across her mouth. She didn’t say anything. She didn’t need to.</p><p>Agatha turned back to her screen, heart pounding now, not with fear but with something steadier. <br/>Something earned.</p><p>For the first time, she hadn’t deflected. Hadn’t hidden behind sharpness or silence.</p><p>She’d simply told the truth.</p><p>By the time Agatha signed off her last chart and shut down her workstation, the tension in her shoulders felt bone-deep. Relief washed over her as she slipped into her sleek black Mercedes, the familiar scent of leather and quiet enclosing her like armour.</p><p>The drive was a blur of streetlights and low music, her thoughts already three steps ahead—checking Rio, asking Lilia how the day had gone, making sure no one had let the other overdo it.</p><p>When she pulled into the drive, the house was dark but not silent. Porch light glowing warm. Curtains drawn.</p><p>Agatha stepped inside, bracing for the calm she associated with Lilia’s home—the soft hush, the lingering scent of herbs or tea, the kind of quiet that invited you to exhale.</p><p>Instead she heard laughter.<br/>Bright, unrestrained laughter, ringing through the house.</p><p>Agatha froze just inside the door.</p><p>It wasn’t just laughter. There were squeals too—high, delighted sounds, punctuated by the faint thud of something small and energetic hitting the floor.</p><p>Her heart lurched.</p><p>She moved quickly toward the living room, confusion sharpening into concern before stopping dead in the doorway.</p><p>Lilia was kneeling on the rug, sleeves rolled up, laughing outright as she waved a large blue feather through the air with surprising agility.</p><p>A small black bundle of fur launched itself after it, skidding across the hardwood, back legs scrambling as it leapt and pounced with single-minded joy.</p><p>On the couch, Rio sat propped comfortably among pillows, arm in its sling, head thrown back in laughter so full and unguarded it stole the breath from Agatha’s lungs.</p><p>Rio pointed, thrilled. “Oh my god, did you see that one?”</p><p>Lilia cackled. “This one’s got ambition!”</p><p>The kitten leapt again, missing the feather entirely and rolling onto its back, paws flailing in a tangle of black fur and enthusiasm.</p><p>Rio laughed harder, the sound bright and unrestrained, head tipped back against the couch cushions and slapping her knee in delighted encouragement.</p><p>Agatha just stood there.</p><p>For a long moment, she couldn’t move.</p><p>Because the sight in front of her—this chaos, this joy, this utterly domestic absurdity—hit her harder than any near-miss or long shift ever had.</p><p>She took it in slowly, like she was afraid the moment might disappear if she blinked.</p><p>Lilia, kneeling on the floor, laughter softening the lines of her face, moving with an ease that came only when she felt completely at home. Rio, relaxed and radiant despite the sling, eyes bright, cheeks flushed with laughter—alive in a way that still felt miraculous to Agatha. The two of them together, so different and yet so perfectly aligned, bound by care and warmth and the easy rhythm of shared affection.</p><p>Her two favourite people.</p><p>Happy.</p><p>Truly, unmistakably happy.</p><p>Something tight and aching in Agatha’s chest loosened at last. The tension she carried every day, the vigilance, the fear that joy was temporary or dangerous had eased its grip. This wasn’t fragile. This wasn’t borrowed time. </p><p>This was real, unfolding right in front of her.<br/>And no one was taking it away from her.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, slow and steady, letting herself stand there in the doorway just a moment longer, memorising the scene, the laughter, the warmth, the small black blur of a kitten batting at a feather like it had always belonged there.</p><p>Lilia finally noticed her.</p><p>“Well,” she said, grinning, not even a little apologetic. “You’re back early.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, voice coming out rougher than she intended. “Why,” she asked carefully, “is there a cat.”</p><p>Rio looked over, eyes lighting up instantly. “You’re home!”</p><p>The kitten chose that moment to launch itself at the feather again, sliding into Agatha’s shoe.</p><p>Agatha looked down.</p><p>Then back up.</p><p>Lilia smiled serenely. “She followed Rio in from the back porch.”</p><p>“It probably has fleas,” Agatha said, eyeing the small black kitten with deep suspicion, as if it might launch itself at her at any moment.</p><p>The kitten, in response, sat down and began grooming one paw with meticulous care.</p><p>“Oh hush,” Lilia said dismissively, waving a hand. “I’ve already checked her over. Ears, paws, belly. She’s perfectly clean.”</p><p>Agatha made a noncommittal sound, still unconvinced, and deliberately shifted her focus away from the kitten and onto Rio.</p><p>Which was a mistake.</p><p>Rio was looking at her with that soft, open smile—the one that made Agatha’s chest go warm and unsteady all at once. Brown eyes bright, crinkling slightly at the corners, full of unspoken affection.</p><p>Agatha felt herself soften immediately, her carefully assembled composure slipping like it always did under that gaze.</p><p>She cleared her throat, grasping for sternness. “I hope <em>you’ve</em> been resting.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, unabashed. “Haven’t broken a sweat all day.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a quiet laugh despite herself. “That’s not what I meant.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said gently.</p><p>For a brief moment, the world seemed to narrow to just the two of them. They held each other’s gaze, neither speaking, but everything said all the same—<em>I missed you. I’m glad you’re here. You’re safe. So am I.</em></p><p>Agatha felt the tension of the day finally ease out of her shoulders.</p><p>Then something tugged at her shoe.</p><p>She looked down to find the kitten batting enthusiastically at her laces, tiny paws determined, claws catching just enough to be annoying.</p><p>Agatha sighed. “Traitor.”</p><p>The kitten responded by pouncing harder.</p><p>“And what exactly are we going to do with this one?” Agatha asked, straightening and turning back to Lilia. “Have you called a shelter?”</p><p>Lilia didn’t answer right away. Instead, she looked at Rio.</p><p>Rio immediately lifted her good hand as if to say,<em> don’t look at me</em>.</p><p>Lilia’s lips twitched. “Actually,” she said slowly, “I was thinking of keeping her.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “You’re joking.”</p><p>“I am not,” Lilia replied serenely. “I’m getting old. I could use the company.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Lilia, this house is never empty. You have more visitors than the ER does. Frankly, I’m surprised Sharon isn’t here right now.”</p><p>“She just left ten minutes ago,” Rio said quickly, far too pleased with herself.</p><p>Agatha stared at the ceiling. “See? Why must I be the adult in this family?”</p><p>The kitten chose that moment to crawl onto Agatha’s shoe and curl up, purring like it had won something.</p><p>Rio bit her lip to keep from laughing.</p><p>Lilia smiled, victorious.</p><p>And Agatha—despite herself—did not move the kitten.</p>

<p>Agatha had always believed she was good at discipline.</p><p>She’d built a life on it. Precision. Control. The ability to want something and not reach for it if the cost was too high. It was how she survived medicine. How she survived grief.</p><p>How she was surviving this.</p><p>Sleeping beside Rio night after night was a particular kind of torture she hadn’t anticipated.</p><p>Not because Rio tried to tempt her. If anything, Rio was gentle, careful, endlessly considerate. It was Agatha’s own body that betrayed her. The way it reacted to closeness. To warmth. To the steady, grounding presence of someone who felt too good to be real.</p><p>Agatha lay awake more often than she cared to admit, tucked into Rio’s good side, acutely aware of every place they touched. The solid line of Rio’s torso beneath her palm. The subtle rise and fall of muscle under skin. The quiet strength there, coiled and contained.</p><p>Sometimes, without thinking, her hand would drift.</p><p>Not boldly. Not greedily.</p><p>Just a slow slide of fingers across Rio’s stomach as they kissed goodnight, her touch skimming warm skin, mapping familiar territory she was deliberately not exploring. Rio’s body was firm there, toned from years of work and motion, and Agatha had to bite back the instinct to press closer, to feel more, to forget herself entirely. But she knew Rio's body was still healing, and she would never forgive herself for causing her any more pain. </p><p>It drove her wild.</p><p>The kisses were the worst part.</p><p>Because they were never hurried. Never careless.</p><p>Rio kissed her like she had all the time in the world, like there was nowhere else she needed to be, no urgency pressing at her back. Her mouth was warm and unassuming at first, soft against Agatha’s, then lingering just long enough to make Agatha’s breath hitch before easing away again. Not retreating. Just… pausing. Waiting.</p><p>It felt almost cruel in its patience.</p><p>Agatha could feel everything in those moments. The press of Rio’s body beneath her hands. The solid heat of her, steady and alive. When Agatha’s fingers skimmed over the smooth plane of Rio’s lower stomach, just barely tracing the definition there, Rio would inhale sharply, a quiet sound that went straight through Agatha’s chest.</p><p>And still, Rio never pushed.</p><p>She trusted Agatha completely.</p><p>Trusted her to lead, or to stop. Trusted her not to take advantage of the way Rio melted into her touch, the way her mouth softened and parted so easily. Trusted her restraint in a way that made Agatha ache more fiercely than want ever could.</p><p>Agatha could feel how close she was to losing herself. How easily the careful balance could tip if she let her hands linger a second longer, if she deepened the kiss just a fraction more, if she allowed herself to follow the instinct burning low in her body instead of the discipline she clung to.</p><p>Every nerve felt lit, buzzing with awareness. Her pulse thudded loud in her ears. She had to concentrate on keeping her touch reverent rather than hungry, grounding rather than claiming.</p><p>Sometimes she broke the kiss herself, breath uneven, resting her forehead against Rio’s while her hands stayed exactly where they were. Not because she wanted to stop kissing her, but because she didn’t trust herself not to want more.</p><p>Rio never complained.</p><p>She would just smile, soft and knowing, and brush her thumb along Agatha’s jaw as if to say <em>I’m here. I understand</em>.</p><p>That trust—that quiet, unspoken permission coupled with absolute patience—was what made it unbearable.</p><p>Agatha had faced trauma and blood and loss without flinching.</p><p>But this?</p><p>This slow, deliberate closeness, this wanting held carefully in check, this intimacy that stopped just short of relief—<br/>It undid her.</p><p>And every night, she chose it anyway.</p><p>Later, alone with her thoughts, Agatha would lie there staring at the dark, pulse loud in her ears, frustrated and aching and profoundly grateful all at once. She hated how much she wanted. Hated how easily Rio undid her. Hated most of all how willingly she chose restraint.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>There was something almost unbearable in how right it felt to want like this and still stop. To know she could take more and choose not to. To let care outweigh desire without resentment.</p><p>It was new. Dangerous. Intimate in its own way.</p><p>Some nights, Rio would shift slightly, half asleep, and murmur her name under her breath. Agatha would tighten her arm around her, press a kiss into her hair, and whisper nothing back. She didn’t trust her voice in those moments.</p><p>Because loving Rio like this meant learning a different kind of control.</p><p>Not the kind that locked things away.</p><p>The kind that stayed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>The cast came off on a Thursday.</p><p>It was nothing like Rio had expected. No fanfare, no pause to mark the end of something difficult. Just a curt explanation from the tech, a warning about the noise, and then the whirr of the saw filling the small exam room. Rio startled at the sound, shoulders tensing on instinct, but she didn’t flinch. Not really.</p><p>Agatha noticed anyway.</p><p>She stood near the wall with her arms crossed, posture rigid, eyes fixed on the careful line of the blade as it cut through plaster and padding. Her jaw was tight, every muscle in her body braced as if she were the one under the blade. She didn’t look away. She didn’t blink.</p><p>The cast split cleanly and was lifted away in two pale halves, exposing skin that looked almost unreal in its paleness. Rio stared at her arm for a second like she didn’t quite recognise it, then laughed softly under her breath.</p><p>“Well,” she said, flexing her fingers tentatively. “That’s… gross.”</p><p>She rotated her wrist, slow at first, then a little more confidently, testing the movement. Her grin spread, bright and boyish, edged with disbelief and something like triumph.</p><p>Agatha only allowed herself to breathe once Rio rolled her shoulder experimentally, careful but unafraid, and smiled again. This one was different. Less tentative. More certain.</p><p>“Ribs feel okay,” Rio said lightly, as if she weren’t reporting on something Agatha had been tracking obsessively for weeks. “Little stiff. Not painful.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, filing the information away, already recalibrating every boundary she’d been living by for weeks. Her voice came out even, controlled. “Still. Desk duty for at least a week,” she said automatically. </p><p>“No heroics.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yes, doctor.”</p><p>It should have marked a return to normal.</p><p>Technically, Rio was due to move back to her own place now. The cast was gone, mobility returning, work easing her back in gently. On paper, there was no longer any reason for her to be staying at Lilia’s.</p><p>However, Lilia kept finding reasons.</p><p>Give Alice and Jen “some more privacy for a while.” The weather “wasn’t great for moving things.” The kitten would “need more time to say goodbye,” and wouldn’t it be easier if Rio stayed just a few more days? Just until the weekend. Just until she felt fully steady.</p><p>Rio accepted every excuse with an indulgent smile, clearly aware of what was happening and choosing not to argue.</p><p>Agatha noticed that too.</p><p>She didn’t comment on it. She didn’t need to. But something warm and quietly grateful settled in her chest at the way Lilia folded Rio into the house as if it were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>As if staying wasn’t an imposition.<br/>As if Rio already belonged there.<br/>And maybe, Agatha thought as she followed Rio out of the exam room, that was the most dangerous shift of all.</p><p> </p><p>That night, Lilia barely made it through dinner before she checked the clock and hummed to herself.</p><p>“Well,” she said brightly, pushing back from the table with an energy that felt just a little too deliberate, “I’m off to bingo with Sharon.”</p><p>Agatha looked up from where she was stacking plates, the words taking a moment to register.</p><p>“Bingo?” Rio echoed from the couch, brows lifting.</p><p>“Yes,” Lilia said, already shrugging into her coat. “She’s been on a winning streak and insists it’s because I bring her luck.” She reached for her keys, then added lightly, “I’ll be late. Don’t wait up.”</p><p>Agatha froze mid-step.</p><p>It was subtle. Anyone else might have missed it. The way her hand stilled against the counter. The fractional pause in her breathing, like her body had reached the conclusion before her mind caught up.</p><p>Rio caught it immediately.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio said, trying — and failing — to sound casual. “Okay.”</p><p>Lilia turned then, eyes flicking between the two of them. There it was. That small, knowing smile that lived just at the corner of her mouth. Not smug. Not teasing. Simply aware.</p><p>“Well,” she said, patting Rio’s shoulder as she passed, “behave yourselves.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. “Lilia—”</p><p>“I said don’t wait up,” Lilia repeated cheerfully, already opening the door. She paused just long enough to glance back at them, warmth softening her expression. “Enjoy the quiet.”</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>The door closed behind her with a soft, definitive click that echoed through the house far louder than it had any right to.</p><p>The silence that followed was different.</p><p>Not awkward. Just… charged.</p><p>Agatha stood very still, acutely aware of the space Lilia had left behind. Of Rio, warm and solid only a few feet away. Of the fact that for the first time in weeks, there was no one else in the house to hear them breathe.</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, rolling her shoulders as if she, too, were adjusting to the change. “She did that on purpose,” she said quietly.</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “She absolutely did.”</p><p>Agatha stood in the quiet of the hallway and realised something had finally tipped.</p><p>Rio was alone with her now. Truly alone. No cast. No careful choreography. No fragile caution threading through every thought. She was still healing, yes—but she was strong, steady on her feet, shoulders loose, body no longer guarded in that instinctive way Agatha had memorised.</p><p>Ninety percent healed.</p><p>And Agatha was done pretending she wasn’t counting the percentage.</p><p>She watched Rio move through the living room, barefoot, comfortable, reaching for a glass of water like this was already her home. The sight hit Agatha low and sharp, a rush of want she didn’t bother suppressing this time.</p><p>She had waited. God, she had waited.</p><p>With discipline. With restraint that had burned her raw.</p><p>Enough.</p><p>Rio turned and caught her staring.</p><p>There it was. That flicker. That shared recognition that landed between them like a struck match.</p><p>Agatha didn’t think anymore.</p><p>She moved.</p><p>Rio met her halfway, just as decisive, hands fisting in Agatha’s shirt and pulling her close. The impact of it drove them both back, shoulders hitting the wall with a soft, startled thud that knocked the breath from Agatha’s lungs in the best possible way.</p><p>Their mouths crashed together.</p><p>Not slow. Not careful.</p><p>Hungry. Heated. Weeks of restraint breaking open in a single, unguarded kiss.</p><p>Rio’s hands came up instinctively, bracketing Agatha against the wall, not pinning her, just there—present, grounding, desperate to feel her beneath her palms. Agata kissed her back with equal force, lips warm and insistent, body pressing forward without hesitation.</p><p>Agatha felt it everywhere. The heat. The strength. The certainty.</p><p>She dragged her mouth away just long enough to breathe, forehead resting against Rio’s, pulse roaring in her ears. “Tell me if—”</p><p>“I will,” Rio said immediately, breathless but sure, Agatha's hands already sliding up her back. “I’m good. I want this.”</p><p>That was all it took.</p><p>Agatha kissed her again, slower this time but deeper, pouring everything she’d held back into the press of her mouth, the way her body curved in close. Rio responded with a soft sound that went straight through Agatha, her fingers tightening, grounding her there like she’d been waiting for this moment just as fiercely.</p><p>They stayed like that for a long moment—breathing hard, foreheads touching, bodies pressed close enough to feel every shift and tremor.</p><p>Agatha laughed quietly, incredulous, her control finally set down rather than shattered. “I waited,” she murmured. “I really fucking did. It was so hard not to...”</p><p>Rio smiled, flushed and radiant, thumbs brushing along Agatha’s jaw. “I know,” she said. “I felt it.”</p><p>The heat between them built steadily, unhurried but undeniable. It wasn’t frantic. It was focused. Every movement chosen, every pause charged. Agatha felt her control loosening, not slipping away, but being set down carefully, piece by piece.</p><p>Rio guided her gently, small shifts, quiet breaths against her neck. Agatha followed, attentive to every response, every subtle change. The world narrowed to warmth and closeness and the way Rio fit against her like this had always been inevitable.</p><p>At some point they ended up in the bedroom without either of them remembering who led the way.</p><p>Their mouths connected like magnets, breath mingling, teeth nipping with an urgency that had been building for far too long. Agatha’s hands moved with a purpose she hadn’t allowed them in weeks, sliding under Rio’s shirt to find warm skin, tracing the lines of muscle she’d been trying not to think about for weeks. Rio’s response was immediate, a low sound in her throat that sent a jolt straight to Agatha’s core.</p><p>Agatha braced herself above Rio just long enough to assess, to gauge what she needed. The answer was written across her face — flushed skin, eyes dark with want, mouth already kiss-swollen.</p><p>“Agatha…please.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her again without hesitation, all the hunger she’d been suppressing finally unleashed. Rio arched into her, no longer holding back, no longer guarding herself against what they both knew was inevitable.</p><p>Rio responded to each touch with a soft gasp or a quiet murmur of pleasure that only fuelled Agatha’s desire.</p><p>She broke the kiss just long enough to pull Rio’s shirt over her head, tossing it aside without a glance. Her bra followed, and then it was just skin against skin, heat meeting heat, heartbeats racing together.</p><p>“Beautiful,” Agatha murmured against Rio’s throat, her lips tracing patterns along the sensitive skin there. She felt Rio swallow hard, her pulse quickening under Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>“You too,” Rio managed, her hands finding Agatha’s shoulders, tugging insistently. Agatha obliged, shedding her own clothes between frantic kisses, never wanting to be away from Rio’s touch for more than a second.</p><p>When they were both bare, skin to skin from chest to toes, Agatha paused for just a moment, drinking in the sight of Rio beneath her. The street lights filtering through the curtains painted her in soft golds and blues, accentuating every curve, every line of her.</p><p>She was breathtaking.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, reaching for her. Agatha lowered herself back down, their bodies aligning perfectly as they moved together, seeking friction and connection, giving and taking in equal measure.</p><p>Weeks of denial were culminating in a collision of limbs and breathless kisses, hands gripping too tight, bodies moving with an urgency that bordered on ferocious.</p><p>Agatha found herself mesmerised by the wet heat between Rio’s thighs, her fingers gliding easily through slick folds, finding the spot that made Rio’s breath catch and hold.</p><p>Her mind fractured into sharp, brilliant pieces.</p><p>She’s here.</p><p> Not fragile. Not breakable. Warm and solid beneath her hands, moving with her, meeting her without hesitation. Every part of Agatha that had been braced for weeks loosened all at once, and the release was dizzying.</p><p>The sounds Rio made when Agatha touched her like this were intoxicating — soft whimpers, little gasps, her hips moving instinctively to meet Agatha’s hand. Watching her fall apart was addictive, and Agatha found herself wanting to push Rio just a little further each time, wanting to see how much she could take before she couldn’t hold back anymore.</p><p>In turn, Rio’s touch was electric. The way her fingers moved over Agatha’s skin was reverent, like every inch of her was something to be appreciated. When she finally, finally moved lower, her touch was sure, her intent clear. Agatha felt her own breath quicken, her heart rate spike as Rio’s fingers pressed into her, filling her, the sensation almost overwhelming.</p><p>They fit together in a way that felt impossibly right, their bodies moving as one, each seeking their own pleasure while simultaneously wanting to give the other everything. It was a feedback loop of sensation, each moment building on the last, pushing them both closer and closer to that inevitable release.</p><p>Agatha had the strange, disorienting sense that the world had gone quiet.</p><p>Not faded.<br/> Stopped.</p><p>Rio was beneath her hands, warm and real, and when Agatha lifted her head and met her gaze, everything else fell away. The room. The house. Time itself. It was just the two of them, suspended in that charged, breathless space where nothing existed beyond what they were choosing.</p><p>Rio was watching her.</p><p>Not passively. Not waiting.</p><p>Actively holding her gaze, eyes dark and intent, pupils blown wide with want and trust and something that made Agatha’s chest ache. There was no hesitation there. No doubt. Just a steady, unflinching presence that said <em>I am here with you. All the way</em>.</p><p>Agatha felt it like a physical blow.</p><p>Her hands tightened instinctively, not to restrain but to anchor herself, palms memorising the heat and solidity of Rio’s body as if she were afraid it might vanish if she blinked. Her breath stuttered, her heart thudding so loudly she was sure Rio could feel it.</p><p><em>This is it</em>, she thought, dizzy. </p><p><em>This is what it feels like</em>.</p><p>She had never been able to hold eye contact like this before. Not when things mattered. Not when vulnerability crept too close. But now, she couldn’t look away even if she wanted to. Rio’s gaze held her, steady and unwavering, and Agatha realised with a sharp, almost painful clarity that she was seen.</p><p>Completely.</p><p>Loved in real time.</p><p>Her thoughts scattered, fragmented under the weight of it. <em>I love you</em> pulsed through her, wordless but absolute, settling deep in her chest until it felt too big to contain. The feeling was overwhelming, heady, almost frightening in its intensity. She felt lightheaded, unmoored, like the ground had dropped out from under her and she was falling straight into Rio’s eyes.</p><p>When she moved, it was instinctive, driven by that pull.</p><p>Her touch deepened, her presence sharpened, but she never broke eye contact. Neither did Rio. They stayed locked there, breathing each other in, the connection between them loud and undeniable.</p><p>Agatha felt it cresting in her lower belly first, a swelling warmth that left her dizzy and unsteady, like standing too close to the edge of something vast. The love hit her again then, overwhelming in its clarity. </p><p><em>I love her</em>. The thought was so sharp and sudden it nearly undid her.</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened, deepened, as if she felt it too.</p><p>They stayed locked together as their orgasm peaked, breath hitching in unison, bodies tightening instinctively as the sensation surged through them. </p><p>There was no single movement that caused it.</p><p>No act to point to. Just the culmination of touch and gaze and weeks of held-back want finally breaking open.</p><p>Agatha’s grip tightened as the feeling swept through her, stealing the air from her lungs. She opened her mouth in a silent scream as the pleasure rippled through her, vibrating from her spine to her toes.</p><p>Rio made a soft, breathless sound, her hands anchoring Agatha there as the intensity washed over them both, shared and undeniable.</p><p>And then it eased.</p><p>Not abruptly. Not cleanly.</p><p>But slowly, like a tide pulling back, leaving warmth and closeness in its wake.</p><p>Agatha rested her forehead against Rio’s, eyes closed now, breath trembling as she came back to herself. </p><p>Her hands stayed exactly where they were, unwilling to let go.</p><p>When she finally opened her eyes again, Rio was still watching her.</p><p>Still here.</p><p>Still smiling like the world had just tilted and somehow landed exactly right.</p><p>Agatha stayed there, forehead resting against Rio’s, both of them panting, still catching up to their own bodies. Her hands hadn’t moved. She wasn’t ready for them to. The warmth lingered everywhere, a soft, echoing hum that made her feel lightheaded and strangely anchored all at once.</p><p>For a few seconds, neither of them spoke.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were still on her, unfocused and tender, dark with aftershock and something softer underneath. The world felt distant, muffled, as if it had stepped politely aside to give them this moment.</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p>Her chest felt too full, her heart still racing, the truth pressing insistently at the back of her throat. She hadn’t planned to say it. Hadn’t rehearsed it or weighed the consequences the way she usually did. It simply existed now, undeniable.</p><p>She leaned in just enough that her lips brushed Rio’s ear.</p><p>“I love you,” she whispered.</p><p>The words left her softly, almost reverently, like a confession she’d been holding in far longer than she realised. Saying them didn’t feel frightening. It felt grounding. Like setting something precious down exactly where it belonged.</p><p>Rio stilled.</p><p>Then her arms tightened around Agatha, solid and sure, pulling her closer without urgency, just presence. She didn’t rush to respond. She didn’t need to. Her hand slid up Agatha’s back, warm and anchoring, her breath steadying against her skin.</p><p>They didn’t stop.</p><p>Not after the first time. Not after the second.</p><p>Each time blurred into the next, urgency giving way to laughter, then back again, the volume rising with every round as restraint slipped further and further out of reach. Agatha was dimly aware that the house had thin walls. She was also dimly aware that she no longer cared. The thought surfaced once, flickered, and vanished under the pull of Rio’s hands and mouth and the dizzying sense of finally not holding herself back.</p><p>By the time Rio laughed breathlessly and pressed her forehead to Agatha’s shoulder, Agatha felt loose in a way she hadn’t in years.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said, still smiling, still too close. “I think I need water before I fall over.”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a quiet laugh. “Come downstairs with me.”</p><p>Rio barely managed to shove on boxers and an old T-shirt. Agatha grabbed her robe, tying it with far less care than she usually applied to anything, cheeks still warm, pulse still loud. They didn’t make it more than a few steps without colliding again, hands roaming automatically, mouths meeting between half-whispered laughter.</p><p>They were a mess.</p><p>They kissed on the stairs. Nearly missed a step. Rio giggled when Agatha bumped her hip into the banister, and Agatha hissed a warning that carried absolutely no authority.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered, grinning.</p><p>“Keep moving,” Agatha muttered, though she was the one who stopped to kiss her again.</p><p>They turned the corner into the kitchen—<br/>And froze.</p><p>“Oh,” Sharon said.</p><p>Agatha felt the blood drain from her face.</p><p>Lilia and Sharon were standing at the table, bingo cards spread out, coats half-off. </p><p>Sharon stared very intently at the wall. The counter. The ceiling. Anything but the two of them tangled together in the doorway.</p><p>Lilia, meanwhile, looked pleased.</p><p>Deeply. Unmistakably. <em>Smugly</em> pleased.</p><p>Agatha’s hand dropped from Rio’s waist like it had been burned. She straightened too fast, robe clutched closed, posture snapping back into something stiff and defensive that fooled absolutely no one.</p><p>“You’re—” Agatha stopped. Cleared her throat. Tried again. “You’re home.”</p><p>“Yes,” Lilia said serenely, eyes sparkling. “Earlier than planned.”</p><p>Agatha nodded too many times. “I— we—” She gestured vaguely toward the fridge. “Water.”</p><p>Sharon coughed loudly. “Thirst work.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>Just briefly. Just long enough to regret every life choice that had led her here.</p><p>Rio, traitor that she was, pressed her face into Agatha’s shoulder, shoulders shaking with barely-contained laughter.</p><p>Lilia glanced between them, taking in the flushed cheeks, the rumpled clothes, the way Agatha couldn’t quite meet her eye. Her smile softened, though it never lost its knowing edge.</p><p>“I told you I’d be late,” Lilia said gently.</p><p>Agatha muttered, “You absolutely did not specify <em>how</em> late.”</p><p>Sharon was still very committed to not looking at either of them. “I’m just going to… make tea,” she announced, already moving.</p><p>Agatha nodded stiffly. “Excellent. Tea. Great.”</p><p>Rio finally looked up, still grinning, entirely unashamed. “Hi,” she offered.</p><p>Lilia smiled warmly at her. “Hello, sweetheart. Glad you’re feeling better.”</p><p>Agatha remained rooted to the spot, mortified, ears burning, very aware that this was the least dignified she had felt in years.</p><p>And, irritatingly—<br/>Also the happiest.</p><p> </p>

<p>Rio eventually moved back into her apartment.</p><p>Lilia took the news personally.</p><p>She tried not to, truly she did, but it showed anyway—in the way she sighed dramatically while helping Rio pack, in the way she found reasons to press leftovers into her hands, in the way she lingered at the door just a little too long on the day.</p><p>“I suppose I’ll just rattle around the house by myself now,” Lilia said mournfully, patting Ebony the kitten as if she, too, were being abandoned.</p><p>Agatha glanced up from where she was carrying a box toward the door, eyebrow lifting.</p><p>“I still live here,” she said evenly.</p><p>Lilia sniffed. “You’re hardly ever home.”</p><p>Agatha paused, considering that. Then, with absolutely no apology in her tone, she replied, “Yes. I wonder why.”</p><p>Rio hugged her tight, murmuring reassurances and promises to visit often, to come for dinner, to call. Agatha watched the exchange with fond amusement—and a quiet, selfish relief.</p><p>Because while she loved Lilia dearly, she was grateful for the shift.</p><p>Grateful for the privacy.</p><p>For the fact that when she and Rio crossed the threshold of Rio’s apartment, there would be no knowing smiles, no carefully timed exits, no one pretending not to hear them laugh or move or exist together. The space was smaller, messier, undeniably Rio’s—and Agatha found she adored it.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t get enough of her.</p><p>When she wasn’t at the hospital, she was finding excuses to be where Rio was. Stopping by the firehouse with coffee she absolutely did not need to bring. Leaning against lockers while Rio joked with her crew, watching her move through that world with easy confidence and affection. The firefighters clocked it immediately—the way Agatha’s sharp edges softened around Rio, the way her eyes followed her without apology.</p><p>And when they weren’t there, they were tangled together in Rio’s bed, limbs overlapping, laughter muffled by pillows, the windows cracked open to noise of the streets and night air. Sometimes it was all heat and hunger, weeks of waiting still echoing in their bones. Sometimes it was quiet—Agatha tracing absent lines along Rio’s ribs, Rio’s fingers carding through Agatha’s hair while they talked about nothing at all.</p><p>It startled Agatha, how natural it felt.</p><p>How easy.</p><p>Since the night she’d whispered <em>I love you</em> without planning to, without bracing for impact, something fundamental had shifted inside her. </p><p>The fear she’d expected never came. </p><p>Instead, the words settled into her, warm and solid, like they’d been waiting for her all along.</p><p>She found herself saying it often.</p><p>Softly, when Rio handed her a mug of coffee in the morning. Casually, when she was halfway out the door to work. Quietly, into the curve of her shoulder when they were pressed together in the dark.</p><p>Sometimes Rio would laugh and say it back, bright and easy. Sometimes she’d go still for a heartbeat, like the words still surprised her, before smiling and pulling Agatha closer.</p><p>Agatha said it because she could.</p><p>For both of them, it became a matter of quiet coordination. </p><p>They learned each other’s schedules the way some people learned tides or seasons, with instinct and attention rather than effort. Shifts overlapped imperfectly, nights ran long, sleep came in fragments—but somehow, they always found each other in the margins. A shared hour before dawn. Dinner at midnight. </p><p>Time bent around them.</p><p>One evening, as if it were nothing at all, Rio handed Agatha a spare key.</p><p>They were standing in the narrow kitchen of the apartment, the city humming faintly through the open window. Rio had dropped it into Agatha’s palm with a casual flick of her wrist, not even looking at her.</p><p>“For when you finish work late,” Rio said lightly. “And don’t want to wake Lilia.”</p><p>Agatha had closed her fingers around it slowly, understanding immediately what it actually meant.</p><p><em>Please come back to me. </em></p><p><em>Please don’t go anywhere else.</em></p><p><em> Please let this be your place too.</em></p><p>She hadn’t teased. Hadn’t deflected. She’d simply nodded and slipped the key onto her keyring like it had always belonged there.</p><p> </p><p>At the hospital, the shift in Agatha hadn’t gone unnoticed.</p><p>She was still formidable. Still precise. Still devastatingly sharp when incompetence crossed her path. But the edge had softened just enough that it startled people who knew her well.</p><p>Wanda noticed first—the way Agatha’s shoulders were less tense between cases, the way she lingered a fraction longer at the end of conversations.</p><p>Jen noticed second.</p><p>“She’s… nicer,” Jen said one afternoon, squinting at Agatha like this was a diagnosis she didn’t quite trust.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up from her chart. “I assure you, I am exactly the same.”</p><p>“Mm,” Jen hummed. “You didn’t threaten anyone today.”</p><p>“No one pissed me off enough.”</p><p>Wanda just smiled to herself.</p><p>Even Teen, against all odds, had managed not to irritate Agatha lately. Or perhaps Agatha had simply stopped taking the bait. Either way, it had been noted.</p><p>So when Jen caught up to her at the end of a long shift, charts tucked under her arm, the grin she wore was sharp with intention.</p><p>“Hey, Harkness,” she said. “Scheduling says we miraculously have Saturday night off. Wanda and Alice are free too. Kate’s working but finishes at nine.”</p><p>Agatha accepted the charts automatically, already suspicious.</p><p>“We’re going to the Witches Road,” Jen continued, entirely too pleased with herself. “If you and Rio can leave the bedroom long enough to join us?”</p><p>Agatha stopped walking.</p><p>She turned slowly, fixing Jen with a look that would have once ended the conversation entirely. Now, it only made Jen grin wider.</p><p>“We’ve all noticed,” Jen added cheerfully. “You’ve been… busy.”</p><p>Jen sighed dramatically, adjusting the charts under her arm. “I am sick to death of hearing Alice mope around the apartment saying she misses her best friend.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed despite herself.</p><p>“She keeps standing in the kitchen like a sad little lamb,” Jen went on. “Staring into the fridge. Sighing. Saying things like, ‘<em>Rio used to text me memes</em>,’ or ‘<em>Rio and I haven’t had a proper hangout in weeks</em>.’..It's depressing me Agatha. Give Alice her friend back.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled through her nose, equal parts irritated and caught. She couldn’t deny it. The last few weeks had been a bubble. Rio’s bedroom had become a world unto itself—warm, insular, safe. They rarely ventured out when they weren’t working, content to stay wrapped in each other, talking, touching, existing without audience. They heard Alice and Jen come and go but rarely saw them or interacted outside of the hospital. </p><p>The idea of giving up one of their precious evenings—of sharing Rio with the noise and presence of other people—felt like an intrusion she wasn’t eager to welcome.</p><p>Agatha glanced down at the charts in her hands, then back at Jen.</p><p>“I’ll speak to Rio,” she said carefully.</p><p>Jen laughed. “I’ll take that as a yes.”</p><p>Agatha watched her walk away, already pulling her phone from her pocket, thumb hovering over Rio’s name.</p><p>She felt it first — a subtle shift in her attention, a quiet pull low in her chest that made her pause.</p><p>She looked up.</p><p>Rio was standing at the end of the corridor.</p><p>For a second, Agatha genuinely thought she might be hallucinating. Long shift. Low blood sugar. Wishful thinking. But then Rio smiled—small and fond, like she’d been caught doing something sweet and slightly indulgent—and lifted the Tupperware container in her hands.</p><p>Agatha smiled before she realised she was doing it.</p><p>Rio crossed the floor easily now, no hesitation in her step, no guarded movements. She looked good—comfortable, a little flushed, hair pulled back messily like she hadn’t planned on being seen. The sight of her there, in this place, in the middle of Agatha’s world, hit harder than it had any right to.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio said softly, like this was the most normal thing in the world.</p><p>Agatha stared at her. Then at the container. Then back at Rio.<br/> “You—” She stopped. Restarted. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>Rio shrugged, entirely too casual for someone dismantling Agatha’s composure cell by cell. “I was at the firehouse. We had downtime. I made empanadas.”</p><p>Agatha’s knees actually went weak.</p><p>“I knew you had a long shift,” Rio continued, opening the container just enough for the smell to escape. </p><p>Warm. Savoury. Comforting. “And I figured hospital food is… whatever crime against humanity they’re committing this week.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>She was still getting used to how fucking adorable Rio could be.</p><p>This woman had come to her hospital, during a long shift, with homemade food, because she<em> thought of her</em>. The thought hit her square in the chest, dizzying and almost painful in its tenderness.</p><p>She wanted—very suddenly, very intensely—to kiss Rio senseless.</p><p>To pull her in by the collar and forget where they were. To press her mouth to Rio’s cheek, her jaw, her smile. To show her exactly what this meant.</p><p>She did none of those things.</p><p>Because Jen was three steps away, watching with the sharp, feral interest of someone about to collect evidence.</p><p>Agatha glanced sideways and caught Jen’s eye.</p><p>Jen raised an eyebrow.<br/>Slowly.<br/>Deliberately.</p><p>Agatha turned back to Rio and lowered her voice. “You realise,” she said, carefully, “that if I so much as touch you right now, Jennifer will never let me hear the end of it.”</p><p>Rio’s smile widened, delighted. “Oh? Why’s that?”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a quiet laugh, fighting the urge to reach for her anyway. “She just lectured me about how I have kidnapped you from Alice and we need to start socialising more.”</p><p>“Mm,” Rio agreed. She nudged the container closer. “I wouldn’t mind being kidnapped by you.”</p><p>Agatha felt that land somewhere low and dangerous.</p><p>She accepted the container with exaggerated care, like it was something sacred, something earned. “I was actually just about to text you,” she admitted, glancing down at her phone as if to prove it.</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Rio said, leaning in closer now, voice soft, curious, teasing. “What were you going to say?”<br/>Agatha paused.</p><p>Her hand itched again, to grab Rio by the collar and close the distance properly. Instead, she curled her fingers around the Tupperware a little tighter and sighed.</p><p>“Jen has invited us to the Witches Road on Saturday night,” she said, rolling her eyes. “Apparently to prove that we aren’t living in some sort of… bubble.”</p><p>Rio’s face did something criminal.</p><p>She pouted. Properly. Lower lip out, brows drawing together in exaggerated disappointment. “But we are in a bubble,” she said, entirely sincere. “I love the bubble.”</p><p>And god help her, Agatha did too.</p><p>The quiet mornings. The late nights. The way the world narrowed down to just the two of them and whatever space they happened to be occupying. It was warm and safe and indulgent, and Agatha had no desire to give it up.</p><p>“So,” Agatha said, a little too quickly, hope sneaking into her voice despite herself, “I’ll tell her no?”</p><p><br/>She could already picture it. Saturday night, uninterrupted. Rio’s bed. No obligations. No commentary.</p><p>Rio hummed, considering it, eyes flicking briefly to Agatha’s mouth before she smiled. “Nah,” she said gently. “We’ll go.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart sank.</p><p>“We haven’t actually hung out with others as a couple yet,” Rio continued, soft but certain. “Not properly. It could be fun.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed, trying not to look as disappointed as she felt. The image she’d been clinging to—of them tangled together, the rest of the world politely excluded—faded a little more with each word.</p><p>“Fun,” she repeated, flatly.</p><p>Rio laughed, clearly catching it, and leaned in just enough to bump her shoulder against Agatha’s. “Hey,” she said. “We’ll still come back to the bubble after.”</p><p>Agatha glanced at her, lips twitching despite herself.</p><p>“…Fine,” she conceded. “But if Jen makes one comment—”</p><p>“I’ll save you,” Rio promised cheerfully.</p><p>Agatha shook her head, resigned and fond all at once.</p><p>She lifted the container slightly, protective instinct kicking in immediately, her mouth tilting into a faint scowl.<br/> “I’m not sharing these.”</p><p>Rio’s smile softened, something warm and indulgent lighting her eyes. She stepped closer without hesitation, close enough that Agatha could feel the heat of her, the familiar comfort of her presence cutting straight through the irritation still clinging to her mood.</p><p>Before Agatha could say another word, Rio leaned in and pressed a soft, unhurried kiss to her lips.</p><p>Not rushed. </p><p>Not hidden. </p><p>Just… there.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught, reflexively, her fingers tightening around the container as if that was the only thing keeping her upright.</p><p>“All yours, <em>mi amor</em>,” Rio murmured, the words wrapped in a teasing warmth that felt entirely unfair.<br/>She winked—actually winked—before turning smoothly and heading back down the corridor, utterly unaware of the devastation she’d just left in her wake.</p><p>Agatha stared after her.</p><p>The name echoed in her head, low and intimate in a way nothing else ever had. Mi amor. My love. The translation landed fully formed and devastatingly effective.</p><p>Her knees very nearly buckled.</p><p>She let out a small, involuntary sigh, shoulders dropping as if her body had decided it was done pretending to be composed. Any lingering irritation evaporated instantly, replaced with something buoyant and ridiculous and deeply inconvenient.</p><p>God help her, she was fucking smiling again.</p><p>She was still smiling when a voice cut in from her left.</p><p>“You guys are so adorable.”</p><p>Agatha stiffened.</p><p>Slowly, she turned her head to find Wanda leaning against the nurses’ station, chin propped in her hand, watching her with open amusement and far too much fondness.</p><p>The smile vanished.<br/>Mood ruined.</p><p>Agatha straightened, spine snapping back into place, face carefully neutral once more. “You saw nothing.”</p><p>Wanda grinned. “I saw everything.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, clutching the Tupperware like a shield. “If you tell Jennifer—”<br/>“Oh, I’m absolutely telling Jennifer,” Wanda said cheerfully.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for just a second.</p><p>So much for dignity.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>Rio was working Friday night.</p><p>Agatha told herself she’d be fine.</p><p>She drove back to Lilia’s after her shift and went through the motions on autopilot. Showered. Changed. Slid into the familiar bed that had been hers for years. The house was quiet in the way it always was at night, old and settled and safe.</p><p>Too quiet.</p><p>Ebony jumped up beside her as soon as Agatha lay down, a small, warm weight curling against her hip. Agatha absently stroked her fingers through the kitten’s soft black fur, the repetitive motion meant to soothe them both. </p><p>Ebony purred immediately, loud and insistent, pressing her head into Agatha’s hand.</p><p>Agatha stared at the ceiling, hand moving on instinct, listening to the steady tick of the clock down the hall. She tried reading. Tried scrolling aimlessly on her phone. Tried reminding herself that this was normal, that couples didn’t need to spend every night together.</p><p>Her bed felt wrong.</p><p>Too wide. Too still. The space behind her felt conspicuously empty, like something essential had been removed and her body hadn’t been informed yet.</p><p>Ebony shifted, pausing mid-purr. She lifted her head, ears flicking, as if she could feel the tension radiating off Agatha’s rigid frame. Agatha’s hand slowed, then stilled altogether.</p><p>After a moment, the kitten wriggled free, hopped lightly off the bed, and padded toward the door without looking back.</p><p>Agatha watched her go, chest tightening at the quiet betrayal.</p><p>“Well,” she murmured to the empty room, voice barely audible. “Fair enough.”</p><p>The door clicked softly as Ebony slipped out, undoubtedly headed for Lilia’s room, drawn to calmer waters.</p><p>At one in the morning, she turned onto her side.</p><p>At two, she sighed for the third time in as many minutes.</p><p>By three, she gave up.</p><p>She dressed quietly, grabbed her keys, and slipped out of the house without waking Lilia. The drive across town felt automatic, muscle memory taking over as the streets blurred past.</p><p>She didn’t overthink it. Didn’t justify it.</p><p>She just knew where she needed to be.</p><p>Agatha parked outside Rio’s apartment and let herself in with the spare key, the soft click of the lock echoing louder than it should have in the stillness. </p><p>Inside, the apartment was dark and quiet, Alice and Jen’s shoe’s lined up beside the door indicating they were both home, likely asleep in Alice’s room.</p><p>Agatha kicked off her shoes and padded into Rio’s bedroom.</p><p>She curled into Rio’s bed like it had been made for her, pulling the covers up and turning onto her side, facing the door. Sleep didn’t come immediately, but the tension eased. Being there was enough. She drifted in and out, aware of time passing without really tracking it.</p><p>At six in the morning, the door opened softly.</p><p>Agatha stirred, consciousness surfacing slowly as the mattress dipped behind her. Familiar warmth pressed in close, careful and practiced. Arms slid around her waist, drawing her back until she was flush against a solid chest.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>The recognition settled before Agatha fully woke, relief washing through her in a quiet wave. Rio’s breathing was slow and tired, her nose nudging gently at the back of Agatha’s neck as she tucked herself in, seeking contact like it was instinct.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, tension she hadn’t realised she was holding finally letting go.</p><p>She shifted just enough to settle more comfortably, a small sound leaving her throat without thought. <br/>Rio’s arms tightened reflexively, a soft hum vibrating against her skin.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha murmured, voice rough with sleep.</p><p>Rio pressed a brief, sleepy kiss to her neck. “You’re here,” she whispered. “Thought you were staying at Lilia’s tonight.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand reached back, fingers curling around Rio’s forearm, grounding herself in the solid reality of her. “I couldn’t sleep,” she admitted quietly. “So I came here.”</p><p>Rio smiled into her neck, warm and unguarded. “Good,” she said simply.</p><p>They lay there like that, bodies aligned, breaths slowly syncing. Outside, the town was beginning to wake, but inside the room everything felt still and contained, like time had paused just for them.</p><p>By ten a.m., Agatha finally woke.</p><p>It was later than she ever slept, even on days off, and the realisation drifted in slowly, cushioned by warmth and weight. Rio was still wrapped around her from behind, arm slung heavy and protective across her waist, breath warm and even against the back of Agatha’s neck. There was a solidity to it that made moving feel not just inconvenient, but wrong.</p><p>Agatha lay there for a few moments longer than necessary, eyes open, staring at nothing in particular while her body stubbornly refused to cooperate with the idea of getting up. Something about Rio’s hold did that to her—made her softer, slower, less inclined to pull herself away from comfort. It was deeply inconvenient.</p><p>And entirely Rio’s fault.</p><p>She shifted just slightly, testing the waters. Rio made a small sound in her sleep and tightened her arm reflexively, nose nudging closer like she was seeking heat even unconsciously.</p><p>Agatha smiled despite herself.</p><p>She knew Rio would need the sleep. Night shifts always took more out of her than she admitted, and Agatha had no intention of being the one to wake her. So, reluctantly, she extricated herself inch by careful inch, peeling Rio’s arm away and replacing it with a pillow like a peace offering.</p><p>Rio barely stirred.</p><p>Agatha paused at the edge of the bed, watching her for a moment—hair a mess, face soft in sleep, utterly unguarded. The sight tugged at her chest in that quiet, familiar way.</p><p>Coffee, she reminded herself.</p><p>She dressed quietly, pulling on jeans and her tank top, then hesitated at the doorway before reaching for the nearest thing on the chair. One of Rio’s WVFD hoodies. It was oversized and smelled faintly like laundry soap and Rio herself. Agatha tugged it on without overthinking it, sleeves swallowing her hands.</p><p>Down the hall, she could already hear movement. The low murmur of voices. A laugh that sounded suspiciously like Alice. Possibly Jen. Definitely too awake.</p><p>Agatha sighed softly.</p><p>She debated retreating. Considered the option of simply lying back down and pretending she didn’t exist until noon. But her body was already staging a rebellion—head dull, shoulders tight, that familiar ache that only caffeine ever truly fixed.</p><p>Resigned, she padded into the kitchen.</p><p>The floor was cool beneath her feet, the apartment bright with late-morning light and the sound of life already in progress. Agatha squared her shoulders, hoodie sleeves pushed up just enough to free her hands, and headed straight for the coffee machine like it was a lifeline.</p><p>She could survive anything.</p><p>But not without coffee.</p><p>When Agatha stepped into the living area, she stopped short.</p><p>Alice and Jen were sprawled on the floor amid a half-dozen cardboard boxes, their contents spilling out in careful disarray. Tangled strings of fairy lights lay coiled like sleeping snakes. Tissue paper rustled softly as Alice lifted ornaments one by one, turning each between her fingers with quiet concentration. Some were chipped. Some mismatched. All of them unmistakably old.</p><p>Jen held one up to the light, squinting at the faded paint and dulled glitter.<br/> “Where did you even get these from,” she said, snorting, “1950?”</p><p>Alice’s mouth curved into a small, fond smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes.<br/> “Probably,” she said. “They were Mom’s.”</p><p>The word settled between them, heavier than the ornaments in Alice’s hands.</p><p>Jen’s expression changed immediately. The humour drained from it, replaced by something sheepish and regretful. “Ah,” she said softly. “I—sorry. That was… not my best moment.”</p><p>She shifted closer without making a big deal of it, bumping her shoulder gently against Alice’s. Her hand hovered for half a second before settling on Alice’s knee, grounding and apologetic all at once.</p><p>“They’re kind of amazing, actually,” Jen added, quieter now. “Very… witchy chic.”</p><p>Alice laughed under her breath, the sound warm despite the sadness threading through it. “That’s her, yeah.”</p><p>Agatha watched the exchange from the doorway, unseen for a moment longer than she intended.</p><p> Something in her chest eased at the sight of it—this small, unguarded tenderness between them.</p><p>Then one of the floorboards creaked beneath her weight.</p><p>Alice looked up first, surprise flickering into recognition. “Oh—hey.”</p><p>Jen followed her gaze, eyebrows lifting as she took in Agatha in Rio’s oversized hoodie, hair still sleep-tousled, eyes not quite fully awake yet.</p><p>“Well,” Jen said, a slow, infuriatingly pleased grin spreading across her face, “if it isn’t Agatha Harkness, out of the bedroom for a change.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look at her. She moved straight toward the coffee machine like it was a lifeline, shoulders still a little stiff with sleep, Rio’s oversized hoodie hanging loose around her frame.<br/>“Fuck off, Jennifer,” she said flatly.</p><p>“Charming as always,” Jen replied, rolling her eyes. “Never change.”</p><p>Agatha poured herself a mug of black coffee, the smell alone making her feel marginally more human. She took a careful sip, letting the bitterness ground her before she trusted herself to say anything else.</p><p>Behind her, Alice was kneeling among the boxes, holding up a string of lights like she’d just uncovered buried treasure.</p><p>“I usually wait for Rio to decorate,” Alice said brightly, trying to inject cheer back into the room, “but she’s been a bit… busy lately.” She shot Agatha a look that was equal parts teasing and fond. “So I thought I’d make a start on the Christmas stuff. Wanna help?”</p><p>Agatha stared into her mug for a second too long.</p><p>Christmas.</p><p>She took another sip, buying herself time. The caffeine hadn’t quite hit yet, and she knew better than to answer before it did. When she finally spoke, her voice was measured, deliberately neutral.</p><p>“Thanks,” she said, “but I’ve never really been the festive type.”</p><p>The reaction was immediate.</p><p>Alice’s hand slipped, the delicate glass bobble wobbling dangerously before she caught it with a sharp inhale. She froze, eyes wide, like Agatha had just said something deeply alarming.</p><p>Jen, meanwhile, huffed under her breath as if this confirmed a long-held suspicion.</p><p>Agatha noticed both reactions at once and frowned. She turned back toward them, mug still warm in her hands. “What?”</p><p>Alice cleared her throat, clearly choosing her words carefully. “Does… Rio know that?”</p><p>Agatha blinked. The question caught her off guard.</p><p>She thought about it—really thought about it. About the conversations they’d had, the nights they’d spent tangled together, the way time had blurred into warmth and closeness and sleep. Christmas hadn’t come up. Thanksgiving barely had. They’d both worked, eaten leftovers, collapsed into bed like gravity demanded it.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said slowly. “The topic hasn’t come up.” She hesitated, then added, genuinely puzzled, “Why is that a problem?”</p><p>Jen snorted, already opening her mouth.</p><p>But Alice cut her off with a sharp whisper, urgent and emphatic. “Rio <em>loves</em> Christmas.”</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>“Like,” Alice continued, eyes wide, hands gesturing helplessly at the boxes around her, “loves it. It’s her favourite time of year. She usually has this stuff up the second Thanksgiving is over. Sometimes before.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed. That didn’t match the Rio she’d been living with the past few weeks. Rio hadn’t mentioned decorating. Hadn’t mentioned plans. Hadn’t even complained about missing it.</p><p>They hadn’t done much for Thanksgiving either. Both of them on shift, both exhausted. They’d eaten something quick, curled up together afterward, content enough not to notice what they were skipping.</p><p>At the time, it had felt natural.</p><p>Now, it felt… off.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Jen said, seizing the opening with glee. “You broke her.”</p><p>Agatha shot her a glare sharp enough to cut. “Do not finish that sentence.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m finishing it,” Jen said cheerfully. “Your icy little heart has rubbed off on her. You turned her. She’s gone full Grinch.”</p><p>Agatha ignored her, but the words stuck anyway, needling at something deeper.</p><p>Because if Rio loved Christmas—<em>really</em> loved it—then why hadn’t she said anything?</p><p>Why hadn’t she insisted? Decorated anyway? Pulled Agatha into it with that easy enthusiasm she brought to everything else she cared about?</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, unease curling low and unwelcome.</p><p>She looked back at the boxes scattered across the floor. The lights. The ornaments. The history embedded in them.</p><p>Something didn’t sit right.</p><p>And for the first time, Agatha wondered if, without meaning to, she’d made herself too comfortable being the centre of Rio’s world—without noticing what Rio might have quietly set aside to stay there with her.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha made a point of helping with the decorations.</p><p>Not hovering. Not standing off to the side with folded arms and dry commentary. She knelt on the floor with Alice and Jen, untangling lights, holding boxes steady, passing ornaments without complaint. It was deliberate, even if she didn’t say so out loud. She needed to understand why Rio hadn’t mentioned Christmas at all. Needed to know whether this was coincidence, or something she had missed.</p><p>Or something Rio had chosen to bury.</p><p>Agatha had always had an aversion to this time of year. Not the lights themselves, or the music, or even the forced cheer. It was deeper than that, rooted somewhere old and raw. Lilia had discovered it early on, back when Agatha was still a teenager with too many sharp edges and not enough language for them.</p><p>She remembered Lilia trying. Gently at first. Decorating the house. Putting on music. Baking things that smelled warm and sweet and hopeful. Inviting Agatha to join in, coaxing her with patience rather than pressure.</p><p>Agatha had tolerated it.</p><p>But the season itself had never softened for her.</p><p>Because every December dragged Evanora back into sharper focus.</p><p>Christmas in that house hadn’t been magical. It hadn’t been special. It had been indistinguishable from any other day, except louder in its absence. No excitement. No warmth. No ritual. Just the same cold indifference wrapped in winter light.</p><p>Agatha remembered watching other children at school in the days leading up to the holidays, vibrating with anticipation. Trading stories about presents and traditions, about trees and baking and family. She’d listened silently, already knowing she would return home to a house where nothing changed.</p><p>No tree. </p><p>No gifts.</p><p> No celebration.</p><p>Just neglect dressed up as normalcy.</p><p>The contrast had been unbearable. The knowledge that something was happening everywhere else that she wasn’t allowed to touch. That joy was real, but not for her.</p><p>So she learned early not to want it.</p><p>Now, sitting on the floor with a coil of lights in her hands, Agatha paused.</p><p>Her thoughts drifted, unbidden, to Rio.</p><p>To Rio’s abuela.</p><p>She imagined a small apartment filled with colour and noise. Music playing too loudly. A tree decorated with mismatched ornaments collected over years. Food simmering on the stove. A younger Rio bouncing on her heels, unable to sit still, face lit up with the uncomplicated joy Agatha had only ever observed from the outside.</p><p>Rio had grown up with warmth.<br/> With rituals.<br/> With someone who showed love loudly and often.</p><p>Agatha had always known that in an abstract way. She’d seen it in how Rio moved through the world—open, generous, unguarded. In the way she loved with her whole chest, never rationing affection, never holding joy at arm’s length the way Agatha had learned to do.</p><p>But standing there with the lights biting faintly into her palms, the truth of it settled deeper.</p><p>Of course Christmas mattered to Rio. </p><p>Of course it did.</p><p>And suddenly, the silence around it made sense.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened, a slow, uncomfortable ache spreading behind her ribs. Not anger. Not quite guilt. Something quieter and heavier than both.</p><p>That was when Rio appeared in the doorway.</p><p>She looked half-asleep, hair still rumpled, one hand rubbing at her eyes as she took in the scene. Boxes on the floor. Alice and Jen mid-sort. And Agatha, sitting among the decorations with a coil of lights tangled in her hands.</p><p>Rio froze.<br/>Her eyes went wide.</p><p>“Shit,” she said immediately, voice thick with sleep and panic. “Agatha, I’m sorry, I didn’t realise Alice would be doing this today.”</p><p>She shot Alice a look that was pure accusation. <em>What the fuck dude?</em></p><p>Agatha watched her carefully.</p><p>Noticed the way Rio’s shoulders had gone tense. The way she was hovering, uncertain, like she’d just walked in on something fragile and wrong. The guilt was written all over her face, and it twisted something sharp and painful in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>She set the lights down slowly.</p><p>“Rio,” she said, steady but direct, “why haven’t you put the decorations up yet?”</p><p>Rio blinked. “What?”</p><p>“Alice said you usually do it straight away,” Agatha continued, cutting cleanly to the point. “Why didn’t you this year?”</p><p>Alice and Jen exchanged a look—one of those silent, mutual decisions—before Jen cleared her throat loudly.</p><p>“Wow, would you look at the time,” she said. “Alice, we should—uh—check the other box.”</p><p>“Yes,” Alice agreed far too quickly. “Very important box. Somewhere else.”</p><p>They disappeared down the hall, giving them the space without ceremony.</p><p>Rio shifted her weight, suddenly very interested in the floor.</p><p>“It’s not a big deal,” she said lightly, too lightly. “We don’t have to decorate <em>every</em> year.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss the tell. The way Rio bit her lip. The way her hands fidgeted at her sides.</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow.<br/>“Rio.”</p><p>The single word carried everything—patience, expectation, and the quiet certainty that Agatha would not be lied to.</p><p>Rio exhaled, shoulders slumping as the fight went out of her. “Okay,” she admitted. “Fine.”</p><p>She hesitated, then said it all in one breath, like ripping off a bandage. “Lilia said you hate Christmas. That it kind of… triggers you. So I didn’t want to put anything up this year.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth fell open.</p><p>Of course Lilia would meddle. With the best intentions. With love and protectiveness and just enough missing context to cause damage anyway.</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio properly then.<br/>At the way she was avoiding eye contact. At the careful distance she’d put between herself and the decorations. At the way she’d quietly folded something she loved away for Agatha’s comfort without ever mentioning it.</p><p>Her heart ached.</p><p>This woman—this beautiful, ridiculous, generous woman—had willingly given up something that brought her joy just to avoid hurting Agatha. Not out of obligation. Not out of fear. Out of love.</p><p>Agatha stood abruptly, the movement decisive.</p><p>“Come here,” she said.</p><p>Rio looked up, startled, then crossed the space between them without hesitation. She wrapped her arms around Agatha’s waist automatically, like this was muscle memory now. Agatha slid her hands up Rio’s back, settling them at her shoulders, grounding herself in the familiar solidity of her.</p><p>She tipped her head back to meet Rio’s eyes.</p><p>“I don’t ever want you to hide or change anything for me,” Agatha said, voice firm despite the emotion tightening her throat. “Ever.”</p><p>Rio frowned slightly. “Agatha, I just—”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha interrupted gently. “And I love that you thought about my feelings. I do.” She swallowed, thumb brushing unconsciously along Rio’s collarbone. “But I don’t want to be the reason you make yourself smaller. Or quieter. Or less joyful.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes softened.</p><p>“If Christmas makes you happy,” Agatha continued, her voice dropping, more vulnerable now, “then that makes me happy. Even if it’s… complicated for me.”</p><p>She let out a breath she hadn’t realised she’d been holding. “I love you. And I want <em>all of you.</em> The parts I understand and the parts I’m still learning.”</p><p>Rio stared at her for a long second.<br/>Then she smiled.<br/>Not the teasing grin. Not the easy charm. Something gentler. Something touched.</p><p>“You sure?” she asked softly.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “I’m sure.”</p><p>Rio leaned down and pressed her forehead to Agatha’s, arms tightening around her waist.</p><p>“Okay,” she whispered.</p><p>“Now help me untangle these fucking lights before I lose my shit,” Agatha said, laughing as she looked back down at the impossible snarl of wires and bulbs abandoned on the floor.</p><p>Rio laughed too, the sound bright and relieved, and dropped back down beside her without hesitation. “Okay, but if this turns into a break-up level argument, that’s on you.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, but she shifted closer anyway, knees bumping, shoulders touching as they worked side by side. Their hands brushed repeatedly, small sparks of familiarity and ease passing between them.</p><p>From the doorway, Alice peeked back in, watched them for a beat, then smiled to herself and quietly retreated.</p><p>As the lights slowly began to cooperate, Rio leaned over and pressed a quick kiss to Agatha’s temple. </p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. She just let her shoulder rest against Rio’s. “You’re welcome.”</p><p>And for the first time in a long while, the idea of Christmas didn’t feel so unbearable.</p><p>It felt… nice.</p>

<p>Agatha and Rio walked into the Witches Road hand in hand, trailing just behind Jen and Alice.<br/>
Agatha was acutely aware of it. Of the way their fingers were laced together, solid and intentional. Of how easily Rio walked beside her, shoulders relaxed, posture open, like she belonged anywhere she decided to stand. They looked—Agatha realised with a faint jolt—exactly like what they were.</p><p>A couple.</p><p>The kind people noticed without meaning to.</p><p>Agatha barely registered the whoops and clapping coming from the far table where Wanda and Yelena were already seated. Her attention was caught entirely by Rio—by the way she scanned the room with easy confidence, the way she smiled at the bartender without hesitation, the way she seemed to take up space without apology.</p><p>Agatha had spent most of her life entering rooms like this braced for impact. Measuring exits. Preparing for scrutiny. But tonight, she felt oddly… shielded. Anchored by the warm weight of Rio’s hand in hers.</p><p>“Do my eyes deceive me?” Wanda called out, grinning as she leaned back in her chair. “Dr. Harkness out in the wild?”</p><p>Agatha’s instinctive response was immediate and sharp. Her shoulders tightened. Her grip on Rio’s hand firmed.</p><p>She shot Wanda a glare that could curdle spirits and turned halfway toward the door, already calculating how quickly she could retreat without it <em>looking</em> like a retreat.</p><p>And then Rio squeezed her hand.</p><p>Just once. Gentle. Deliberate.</p><p>Agatha looked at her.</p><p>Rio smiled back, soft and grounding, brown eyes warm with understanding. Not teasing. Not coaxing. Just there. A quiet reminder: <em>I'm right here with you.</em></p><p>The tension in Agatha’s chest eased, fraction by fraction.</p><p>She exhaled, squared her shoulders, and turned back toward the table.</p><p>“For the record,” Agatha said dryly, forcing a smile as she approached, “I do, in fact, leave the house.”</p><p>“It's a Christmas miracle. God bless us, everyone” Yelena said, lifting her glass in mock salute. </p><p>Agatha snorted despite herself.</p><p>Since she and Rio had made things official, something in Agatha had shifted—subtly, but undeniably. <br/>
Knowing Yelena was no threat had loosened a knot she hadn’t even realised she’d been carrying. She tolerated her now. Occasionally even enjoyed her presence.</p><p>That didn’t mean she’d stopped paying attention.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked, unbidden, to anyone who lingered too close to Rio. Anyone whose gaze lingered a second too long. Her posture shifted instinctively, angling herself just enough to claim space without making a scene.</p><p>Protective. </p><p>Possessive. </p><p>Unashamed.</p><p>Rio noticed, of course. She always did.</p><p>She bumped her hip lightly against Agatha’s, a quiet reassurance, her thumb brushing over Agatha’s knuckles in that absent, affectionate way that made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>She was here. </p><p>She was choosing this. </p><p>She was choosing <em>Agatha</em>.</p><p>Agatha softened visibly, though she doubted anyone else noticed.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Kate finally joined them, breathless and apologetic with her coat still half on, Agatha realised—somewhat to her own surprise—that she was actually enjoying herself.</p><p>The table was loud but not overwhelming, the kind of noise that blended into warmth rather than chaos. Laughter came easily. Conversation flowed without effort. And being seated beside Rio helped more than Agatha would ever admit out loud. Rio’s knee pressed against hers under the table, grounding and constant. Her hand found Agatha’s thigh absentmindedly when she laughed, thumb tracing small, idle circles that kept Agatha tethered to the moment whenever the room threatened to feel too big.</p><p>They’d endured some teasing earlier, of course.</p><p>Jen had made at least three comments about them “emerging from captivity,” each one met with Agatha’s sharp, perfectly timed retorts that shut her down to the table’s delight. Even Alice had laughed, shaking her head fondly as Rio hid her face in Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Somehow, without Agatha noticing when it happened, the attention had shifted.</p><p>They weren’t the spectacle anymore.</p><p>Agatha found that she liked that.</p><p>She’d even allowed herself to be talked into one of the festive cocktails Rio had insisted on ordering for her—something involving cranberry and rosemary and candy cane garnish. She’d rolled her eyes, taken a cautious sip… and then finished the whole thing.</p><p>Now she was halfway through her third drink, warmth humming pleasantly through her veins, edges softened just enough to be dangerous.</p><p>“So, Wanda,” Agatha said suddenly, leaning back in her chair with an ease that surprised even her, “do tell us—how <em>is</em> the Chief doing these days?”</p><p>The words landed with surgical precision.</p><p>Wanda choked mid-sip, coughing hard enough that Yelena had to pat her on the back while the rest of the table went abruptly, gloriously silent.</p><p>Agatha watched it all with open fascination.</p><p>It was common knowledge, really. Unspoken but universally understood. Natasha Romanoff—Chief Romanoff—recently divorced, visibly shaken, and suddenly spending an awful lot of time with Wanda Maximoff. The rumour mill had been working overtime, but no one had dared poke the subject directly.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>“She’s—” Wanda spluttered, wiping at her mouth, eyes darting around the table like she was searching for an escape route. “She’s fine. I mean. As far as I’m aware.”</p><p>The effect was immediate.</p><p>Smirks appeared. Brows lifted. Yelena leaned back in her chair, grinning like she’d just been handed a gift.</p><p>“Oh come <em>on</em>,” Alice said, delighted, leaning forward. “Spill it. We all know there’s something going on.”<br/>
Wanda groaned, dropping her face into her hands. “There is <em>not</em>—”</p><p>“Wanda,” Jen said sweetly, “you’ve been smiling at your phone like a teenager for weeks.”</p><p>Kate nodded. “It’s kinda obvious.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back further, utterly at ease now, a smug little smile tugging at her mouth. For once, the spotlight wasn’t on her. She wasn’t the subject of speculation or whispered commentary. She got to watch someone else squirm.</p><p>It was deeply satisfying.</p><p>Beside her, Rio leaned in close, lips brushing Agatha’s ear as she whispered, “You’re a menace.”<br/>
Agatha didn’t look away from Wanda. She just lifted her glass slightly in a silent toast, eyes bright with mischief.</p><p>“I learned from the best,” she murmured back.</p><p>And as laughter broke out around the table and Wanda tried valiantly to change the subject, Agatha felt something settle comfortably in her chest.</p><p>She belonged here.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>It started subtly.</p><p>One song ended, the low murmur of conversation filling the bar for a beat — and then the opening notes of a Christmas song slid in, unmistakable and unapologetic. Groans rippled through the room, followed immediately by laughter.</p><p>“Oh God,” Jen said, already grinning. “Here we go.”</p><p>The bartender turned it up anyway. Someone near the dartboard whooped. Another table started singing loudly and badly, arms slung around each other’s shoulders. Soon the whole bar tipped into something communal and ridiculous, voices overlapping, lyrics half-remembered but enthusiastic.</p><p> </p><p>"<strong>Who's got a beard thats long and white</strong>?" The bar tender sang loudly.</p><p>"<strong>Santa's got a beard thats long and white</strong>!", the crowd sang back.</p><p>Agatha watched it all with cautious neutrality.</p><p>She didn’t join in. Didn’t retreat either. She stayed where she was, Rio warm and steady at her side, glass loose in her hand. The noise pressed in, festive and earnest in a way that usually made her itch.</p><p>Then she noticed Rio wasn’t singing.</p><p>She laughed when Alice butchered a line. Smiled when Jen leaned into it theatrically. But her mouth stayed closed, teeth worrying gently at her lower lip like she was holding something back.</p><p>Agatha felt it immediately.</p><p>That familiar restraint. That instinct to dim herself.</p><p>Agatha glanced at her again, really looked — at the soft light catching in her eyes, at the way joy hovered just under the surface, waiting for permission.</p><p>So she took a breath.</p><p>And then she sang.</p><p>"<strong>Must be Santa, must be Santa, must be Santa, Santa Claus</strong>"</p><p>Not loudly. Not to the room. Just enough to be heard by the person beside her. Her voice was low, a little rough from disuse, but steady. She didn’t look anywhere else. Just at Rio.</p><p>Rio froze.</p><p>Her eyes snapped to Agatha’s face, surprise flashing — and then melting into something bright and unguarded. Her shoulders relaxed. Her smile bloomed, sudden and radiant.</p><p>Agatha kept singing, mouth tilting into a small, deliberate smile that said <em>you’re allowed</em>.</p><p>Rio swallowed, then joined in.</p><p>"<strong>Who's got boots and a suit of red? Santa's got boots and a suit of red</strong>"</p><p>Her voice slid in beside Agatha’s like it had always belonged there — warm, confident, joyful. She leaned closer as they sang, shoulders brushing, hands finding each other without thought. The bar swelled around them, but Agatha barely noticed.</p><p>For once, she wasn’t watching joy from the outside.</p><p>She was inside it.</p><p>When the song ended, the room erupted into applause and whistles. Someone clapped off-beat. Someone else shouted for an encore.</p><p>Agatha laughed softly, breathless in a way that surprised her.</p><p>She turned toward Rio—<br/>
And Rio leaned in and kissed her.</p><p>It was unhurried and sure, right there in the glow of Christmas lights and noise and approval. A kiss that felt like gratitude. Like pride. Like <em>thank you for seeing me</em>.</p><p>Agatha’s hand came up instinctively, fingers curling into the back of Rio’s jacket as she kissed her back, unselfconscious and present in a way she rarely allowed herself to be.</p><p>When they pulled apart, Rio’s forehead rested briefly against hers, smile warm and unmistakably happy.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, heart full in a way that felt new and fragile and wonderful. “I love you too.”</p><p>As the night wore on, the table descended into a kind of cheerful disarray.</p><p>Kate and Yelena had vanished to the bathroom together once without comment. Twice with raised eyebrows. By the third disappearance, Agatha stopped pretending there was any plausible deniability left. </p><p>Kate returned flushed to the tips of her ears, laughing a little too loudly at absolutely nothing, while Yelena’s hair was decidedly more disheveled than when she’d left, her expression smug and unapologetic.</p><p>Agatha took a slow sip of her drink and leaned toward Rio. “If they go back a fourth time, I’m calling it.”</p><p>“Calling what?” Rio asked innocently.</p><p>“A hotel to book them a fucking room.” Agatha replied. </p><p>Rio snorted.</p><p>At the other end of the table, Jen had somehow cornered Wanda and was offering advice with the confidence of someone who had absolutely not been asked.</p><p>“No, listen,” Jen said, gesturing vaguely with her glass. “It’s all about angles. People underestimate the importance of leverage when it comes to scissoring.”</p><p>Wanda stared into her drink like it might save her.</p><p>Across from them, Alice had lost the battle entirely. Her head had tipped sideways, resting against the back of the booth, mouth slightly open, breathing slow and even. Every so often she twitched, like she was still trying to participate in the conversation from another plane of existence.</p><p>Agatha surveyed the scene with detached fondness.</p><p>This chaos, this unfiltered mess of people who cared about one another wasn’t something she would have chosen once. Wouldn’t have tolerated for long. And yet, here she was, content enough not to leave, amused enough to stay.</p><p>Beside her, Rio leaned in, warm and close, her voice low and conspiratorial.</p><p>“Can we go back to the bubble yet?”</p><p>Agatha turned to look at her properly.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were a little glassy, her smile loose and affectionate, the festive lights reflecting softly in her gaze. She looked happy. Comfortable. Entirely at ease.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate.</p><p>She nodded, emphatically. “Oh, thank god.”</p><p>She was already reaching for her bag when she added, “Grab my coat before Jen starts a PowerPoint.”</p><p>Rio laughed, sliding out of the booth and snagging it from the back of the chair. “You don’t want to hear about her top five—”</p><p>“Not even a little,” Agatha said firmly, standing and looping an arm around Rio’s waist.</p><p>They made their excuses quickly—gentle nudges, fond goodbyes, Alice barely stirring as Rio kissed her temple and promised breakfast. Wanda mouthed <em>thank you</em> at Agatha like she’d been rescued.</p><p>Outside, the cold air hit them both at once, sharp and sobering.</p><p>Rio tucked her arm through Agatha’s, pressing close as they walked. “Bubble time,” she said happily.</p><p>Agatha smiled, genuine and unguarded, and leaned into her. “Bubble time.”</p><p><br/>
They walked home together hand in hand, the cold biting pleasantly at their cheeks, breath puffing white in the glow of the streetlights. The city felt quieter at this hour, like it was winding down with them. Rio swung their joined hands back and forth as she hummed the tune that had been playing earlier in the bar, soft and a little off-key, completely unselfconscious.</p><p>Agatha let herself listen.</p><p>“I had a really good time,” she said after a moment, the words surprising even her as they left her mouth. She glanced sideways at Rio, then back to the pavement. “I didn’t think I would.”</p><p>Rio slowed just slightly, giving her attention without interrupting.</p><p>“It isn’t easy for me to make friends,” Agatha continued, voice quieter now, more thoughtful. “Or… to let people in. I usually feel like I’m performing something when I’m around groups. Like I’m waiting for the moment it gets exhausting and I have to leave.”</p><p>She squeezed Rio’s hand, grounding herself in the warmth of it. “But tonight didn’t feel like that.”<br/>
Rio didn’t rush to respond. She just walked with her, close enough that their coats brushed, listening in that steady way she had. When she finally spoke, her voice was warm and sure.</p><p>“You didn’t have to be anything tonight,” Rio said. “You were just… you.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a small, disbelieving laugh. “That’s usually the part people don’t enjoy.”</p><p>Rio stopped walking.</p><p>Agatha turned, startled, and found Rio looking at her with that open, earnest expression that always disarmed her. The streetlight above them cast a soft halo around Rio’s hair, made her eyes look impossibly warm.</p><p>“I enjoy it,” Rio said simply. “All of it. The sharp bits. The quiet bits. The parts you think you need to apologise for.”</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest loosened, a slow unravelling she hadn’t realised she was holding tight.</p><p>She swallowed. “I liked… singing with you,” she admitted, the confession softer now. “I don’t usually do things like that.”</p><p>Rio smiled, thumb brushing over Agatha’s knuckles. “I noticed.”</p><p>“And you didn’t laugh.”</p><p>“I wanted to kiss you,” Rio said, grinning. “But I waited.”</p><p>Agatha snorted, warmth blooming in her cheeks that had nothing to do with the cold. “I’m glad you did. You would have threw off my timing.”</p><p>They started walking again, closer now, shoulders bumping lightly with each step. Rio leaned her head briefly against Agatha’s shoulder, still humming, the sound grounding and familiar.</p><p>By the time they reached the apartment building, Agatha felt pleasantly tired in a way she rarely did. Not drained. Not wrung out. Just… content.</p><p>As they climbed the stairs, Rio glanced back at her. “Same time next year?”</p><p>Agatha pretended to consider it, lips quirking. “Let’s not get ahead of ourselves.”</p><p>But she didn’t pull her hand away.</p><p>And when they approached the front door, shedding coats and cold and noise, Agatha knew—with a quiet certainty that settled deep—that nights like this didn’t scare her anymore.</p><p>Not when she got to walk home like this.</p><p>With Rio.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
They barely made it through the door.</p><p>The moment the lock clicked behind them, the night seemed to collapse inward, the quiet of the apartment swallowing the town whole. Coats were shrugged off hastily, keys abandoned somewhere near the door, neither of them particularly concerned with where anything landed.</p><p>Rio turned first.</p><p>It was instinctive. Like her body had been waiting for the threshold to be crossed.</p><p>Her hands found Agatha’s waist, firm and familiar, pulling her close without hesitation. Agatha went willingly, breath leaving her in a soft, surprised sound as she was backed gently but decisively against the door.</p><p>They kissed like they’d been holding it in all evening.</p><p>Not tentative. Not careful.</p><p>Agatha’s hands came up to cradle Rio’s face, thumbs brushing warm skin as if she needed to feel her properly, to reassure herself that this was real, that the laughter and singing and warmth of the night hadn’t evaporated the moment they stepped inside.</p><p>Rio tasted like winter air and wine and something unmistakably hers.</p><p>They were still kissing when Rio’s hands slid down Agatha’s sides, firm and decisive.</p><p>Agatha barely had time to register the shift before Rio bent slightly, hands hooking securely behind the backs of her thighs. There was a brief, surprised laugh against Rio’s mouth — and then Agatha was lifted effortlessly, back pressing to the door as her legs instinctively wrapped around Rio’s waist.</p><p>“Oh,” Agatha breathed, pulse spiking.</p><p>Rio grinned against her lips, pleased and unapologetic. “Bedroom,” she murmured again, like a promise this time.</p><p>She carried her without hesitation, steady and sure, Agatha’s arms tightening around her shoulders as the world tilted just enough to make her dizzy. The apartment blurred past them — the hallway, the soft glow of a lamp, the quiet hum of the night — all of it secondary to the warmth of Rio’s body and the way she moved like this was exactly where Agatha belonged.</p><p>She buried her face against Rio’s neck, her breath shaky, the scent of her filling Agatha’s senses. She could feel Rio’s steady heartbeat, the solid strength of her arms, the way she held Agatha without effort, without hesitation.</p><p>The bedroom door nudged open when Rio shouldered it. Two long steps later, she was lowering Agatha to the bed, her movements slow and careful, her hands lingering on Agatha’s legs as if reluctant to release her.</p><p>For a heartbeat they just looked at each other.</p><p>Agatha’s own heart was pounding now, her chest rising and falling too quickly beneath Rio’s gaze. She felt caught, exposed in a way she hadn’t experienced in years, maybe ever. Rio’s expression was soft but intent, her eyes dark and warm in the low light, her hair falling forward just enough to shadow her face.</p><p>When Rio spoke, her voice was low, almost a rumble. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. “More than,” she answered, finally finding her voice. Her hands were still resting on Rio’s shoulders, her fingers twisting slightly in the fabric of her shirt. “Don’t stop.”</p><p>Something in Rio’s expression shifted then, softened further, became impossibly tender. She leaned in slowly, deliberately, and pressed her lips to Agatha’s forehead — a touch so gentle it made Agatha’s breath catch.</p><p>“Not planning on it,” Rio murmured against her skin. Then she shifted, moving to kiss Agatha properly, thoroughly, like she meant to pour every intention, every unspoken word into it.</p><p>The bed creaked softly as Rio climbed over Agatha, her knees pressing into the mattress on either side of Agatha’s hips. Agatha’s fingers threaded through Rio’s hair, pulling her just a little bit closer, deepening the kiss without thinking.</p><p>She could feel the tension in Rio’s frame, the restraint she was exercising. Agatha arched up into her, her teeth catching Rio’s bottom lip with just enough pressure to make her groan, low and approving.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed, pulling back just enough to look at her again, her expression a clear question.</p><p>“Please,” Agatha answered without hesitation, her own voice uncharacteristically rough. She shifted under Rio, her legs spreading wider, one foot hooking behind Rio’s knee to pull her closer. “Need you.”</p><p>Something sparked in Rio’s eyes then, something that made Agatha’s pulse spike all over again. Rio lowered herself slowly, pressing Agatha back into the mattress, her weight warm and grounding and exactly what Agatha had been craving without fully realising it.</p><p>They moved together like that for long minutes, lost in sensation, in the taste and feel of each other. It was maddening and intoxicating all at once, the buildup too slow, too careful, too everything. Agatha felt like she was burning up from the inside, her skin overheated, her nerves alight, her entire body strung tight and desperate for release.</p><p>“Rio,” she managed finally, pulling back enough to speak, her fingers gripping Rio’s shirt, her voice rough with need. “Off. Now.”</p><p>Rio’s laugh was warm, amused, but she obliged, sitting back on her heels to pull her shirt over her head in one smooth movement. The light from the hallway caught the defined muscle of her arms, her stomach, her shoulders, and for a moment, Agatha could only stare.</p><p>When Rio leaned down again, bracing herself over Agatha, it took all of Agatha’s self-control not to pull her down and grind up into her immediately. Instead, she watched Rio’s slow approach, the warm gaze, the unhurried way she took in every detail of Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha felt exposed again, vulnerable in a way she didn’t recognise, wasn’t accustomed to. It was disconcerting and terrifying — and yet, beneath that, she felt safe. Safe in a way she couldn’t fully articulate.</p><p>It was that realisation, that bone-deep certainty, that finally loosened the last of her tension, allowed her to relax back into the bed, to let her eyes flutter closed as Rio lowered her head to kiss her again.</p><p>This kiss was different. Slower. Deeper. It felt less frantic somehow, less desperate. It felt like an exploration, a promise.</p><p>Agatha lost track of time then, her awareness narrowing to the sensation of Rio’s mouth, the weight of her body, the calloused warmth of her hands. She felt herself growing wetter, her underwear clinging to her skin, and the knowledge just made her more desperate, more eager, for everything Rio was willing to give.</p><p>When Rio finally sat back, her eyes were dark, her lips kiss-swollen and pink. “You have no idea how crazy you make me, I wanted to do this since we walked into that bar,” she murmured, her gaze tracking down Agatha’s body.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, lifting her head to watch as Rio’s fingers toyed with the button of her jeans. “Then maybe you should actually do it,” she said, hearing the faint waver in her own voice.</p><p>Rio’s gaze snapped back up to meet hers, something sparking in her eyes, a hint of challenge. “Tell me what you want, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha held her gaze without flinching. “I want your mouth on me.”</p><p>Something in Rio’s expression softened then, warmed. She moved without hesitation, her hands sliding to Agatha’s zipper, the sound loud in the stillness of the room.</p><p>The air was cool against Agatha’s skin as Rio peeled her jeans down her legs, her gaze never leaving Agatha’s face. Agatha lifted her hips to help, her breath catching when Rio finally had to look away to tug her jeans past her knees, to drop them unceremoniously to the floor.</p><p>She was naked now except for her underwear and the shirt she still wore, unbuttoned and hanging open. The room was warm but she felt goosebumps rise along her skin anyway, shivered at the feel of Rio’s gaze.</p><p>“So fucking beautiful,” Rio murmured. She was still kneeling between Agatha’s legs, her hands running up the outside of Agatha’s thighs, her thumbs brushing the sensitive skin of Agatha’s inner thighs.</p><p>Agatha sucked in a sharp breath. She was a live wire of sensation, every touch, every look making her pulse spike.</p><p>When Rio lowered her head, pressing her lips to the inside of Agatha’s knee, Agatha bit her lip, her fingers curling into the sheets. She kept her eyes open, watching Rio’s every movement, every reaction. Rio’s hands slid higher, spreading Agatha’s legs wider, and then Rio was kissing her way up the inside of her thigh, her mouth warm, her breath hot against increasingly sensitive skin.</p><p>Agatha nearly jumped when Rio’s lips reached the edge of her underwear. She could feel how wet she was, how desperate, and she knew Rio could feel it too, the evidence of her arousal pressing insistently against Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“God,” Agatha breathed, her hips arching up of their own volition.</p><p>Rio’s hands were firm on her legs, holding her in place easily. She didn’t say a word, just moved her lips to the other thigh, starting the torture all over again, making Agatha shake and burn and ache with every deliberate caress.</p><p>“You’re killing me, Rio,” Agatha finally managed, her voice a rough plea, her hands fisting in the sheets above her head.</p><p>Rio’s laugh was quiet, amused. She pressed a final kiss to the inside of Agatha's thigh and then sat back slightly, her fingers hooking into the waistband of Agatha’s underwear.</p><p>Agatha lifted her hips without prompting, helping Rio slide the wet fabric down her legs. The air was cool on her overheated skin, the anticipation nearly unbearable.</p><p>For a moment, Rio just looked at her. The heat in her gaze was almost palpable.</p><p>Then, finally, she lowered her head again.</p><p>Agatha’s back arched off the bed at the first touch of Rio’s tongue, the cry that escaped her entirely involuntary. Rio’s hands held her hips in place, keeping her pinned to the mattress as she licked and sucked and tasted, her tongue working Agatha with a focus and determination that made her mindless.</p><p>Agatha’s world narrowed to the feel of Rio’s mouth on her, the wet slide of her tongue, the perfect pressure of each caress. She heard herself make noises she didn’t recognise — sounds of need, of pleasure, of desperation. Her fingers were in Rio’s hair again, alternately pulling her closer and clutching desperately, her entire body trembling, her nerve endings alight.</p><p>When Rio’s lips closed over her clit, sucking gently, Agatha cried out, her voice uncharacteristically loud in the quiet room. She felt her muscles start to shake, the familiar tightening beginning to build.</p><p>“Fuck,” she breathed, unable to form more coherent words.</p><p>Rio made a low noise of approval, her lips and tongue still working Agatha relentlessly. Her hands slid from Agatha’s hips, moving underneath her to palm her ass, holding her at the perfect angle to continue the sweet torture.</p><p>Agatha was shaking all over now, her legs tensing, her hips straining. She couldn’t think, couldn’t do anything but feel, the pressure building and building until she thought she might break apart from it.</p><p>When Rio slid two fingers inside her, curling them to press against that perfect spot, Agatha did break apart.</p><p>Her orgasm crashed over her, a wave of blinding sensation. She shook through it, her cries coming in helpless succession, her body clenching around Rio’s fingers.</p><p>It seemed to go on forever, an endless ebb and flow of pleasure. Rio stayed with her the whole time, her tongue gentler now, her fingers still moving, drawing out the sensations, keeping them going even as they started to subside.</p><p>Agatha finally sagged back into the mattress, fully boneless, her breathing ragged, her hair stuck to her forehead. She was covered in a fine layer of sweat, overheated and shaking and sated, her entire body pulsing with pleasure, her mind blissfully blank.</p><p>It was a moment before she realised Rio was still touching her, her lips pressing soft kisses to Agatha’s stomach now, her hands gentle on Agatha’s hips and thighs.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha managed, her hand lifting to run through Rio’s hair.</p><p>Rio lifted her head, her lips shiny and swollen, her eyes warm with a mix of affection and satisfaction and lingering desire. She kissed Agatha’s hip, her thumb brushing across Agatha’s clit in a gentle caress. “You okay?” she asked.</p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh, her body still thrumming pleasantly. “I think you know the answer to that.”</p><p>Rio grinned, lowering her head to press a kiss to the top of Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>For a long moment, Agatha just caught her breath</p><p>“Come here,” she said finally, her voice still rough with pleasure. “And take your pants off.”</p><p>Rio sat back immediately, her gaze meeting Agatha’s, something sparking in her eyes. Without looking away, she undid her jeans, lifting her hips to push them down.</p><p>Agatha propped herself up on her elbows, watching with blatant appreciation as Rio’s underwear came into view. Black boxer briefs, tight enough to hint at the muscles of her thighs. “Jesus,” Agatha said appreciatively, her eyes dragging up the rest of Rio’s body. She was still wearing her bra, her nipples visible through the black cotton.</p><p>Rio’s cheeks were pink, but she didn’t look away, didn’t try to cover herself. She hooked her fingers into her boxer briefs, lowering them enough that Agatha could see the trail of dark hair leading down from her belly button.</p><p>Agatha groaned, dropping back onto the bed. “If you don’t get up here in the next three seconds, I might actually die.”</p><p>Rio laughed, kicking free of the last of her clothing. She crawled up Agatha’s body, stopping to press kisses to her skin as she went, until she was braced over Agatha again, her gaze warm on Agatha’s face. “You look pretty satisfied for someone who was just threatening me,” she teased, brushing Agatha’s hair away from her forehead.</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to respond, but the sight of Rio above her, naked, made her mind go blank. Rio was beautiful — lean, toned muscle, smooth skin, small breasts. There was a small birthmark on her ribs, another low on her abdomen, and a thin white scar on the side of one thigh.</p><p>Agatha wanted to touch every part of her.</p><p>“Where’s your strap?” she asked, her voice rough again.</p><p>Rio’s eyes went dark with something Agatha couldn’t quite read, but she nodded, ducking her head to kiss Agatha gently before sitting up. She reached for the bedside table, opening the drawer to pull out a leather black harness and dark green dildo.</p><p>Agatha watched as Rio slid the harness up her legs, securing the strap around her hips and between her legs.</p><p>“What?” Rio asked when she realised Agatha was just watching her, a smile tugging at her lips.</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “Nothing,” she said. She’d never seen anyone look so comfortable in their own skin, never met anyone so unselfconscious, so at ease with who they were. She found she couldn’t look away from the sight of Rio in the harness, the toy she’d chosen nestled firmly against her.</p><p>When Rio was settled, she braced herself over Agatha again. She leaned down to kiss her, slow and deep and thorough, the feel of her bare skin against Agatha’s making Agatha moan against her mouth.</p><p>Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck, holding her close as they kissed, her thighs spreading wider to accommodate Rio’s hips between them.</p><p>Rio was touching her everywhere, running her hands over Agatha’s ribs, palming her breasts, running her fingertips over Agatha’s collarbone. She didn’t stop kissing her, either, her mouth gentle and unhurried and devastatingly thorough. Agatha felt like she might be melting, every cell of her body warm, every nerve ending lit up with sensation. Rio’s skin was smooth against hers, soft but for the lean muscle underneath.</p><p>When Rio finally slid inside her, it was so, so slow, so careful. Her hips pressed firmly against Agatha’s, and Agatha gasped against Rio’s mouth, breaking their kiss.</p><p>“Okay?” Rio murmured, her lips pressed to Agatha’s cheek.</p><p>Agatha nodded, her fingers curling against the back of Rio’s neck. She felt full and overwhelmed and completely consumed, her pulse racing at the feeling of Rio inside her.</p><p>“Fuck, you feel amazing mi amor,” Rio told her, dropping another kiss on Agatha’s cheek, then her jaw, then her neck.</p><p>Agatha moaned, shifting her hips slightly. She could feel the base of the toy snug against her, could feel Rio’s hips against hers. When she wrapped her legs around Rio’s waist, Rio groaned softly, dropping her head so her forehead rested against Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>“God,” she breathed. She moved her hips slightly, grinding against Agatha, and Agatha saw stars.</p><p>“Fuck, Rio,” she managed, tightening her grip on Rio’s shoulders, her heels digging into the back of Rio’s thighs. She felt surrounded by Rio, consumed by her — the feel of her skin and the smell of her and the soft sounds she was making. Her heart was racing, her skin hot and hypersensitive.</p><p>Slowly, Rio began to move.</p><p>Agatha gasped, her fingers digging into Rio’s skin. Rio kept her eyes on Agatha’s face as she rocked her hips, sliding in and out of Agatha with perfect control. It was a slow, steady rhythm, a relentless build of pressure and pleasure.</p><p>It didn’t take long for Agatha to feel like she was losing her mind.</p><p>Her thighs were starting to shake again, her breath coming in short gasps. She could feel herself clenching around the toy with every thrust, her back arching off the mattress.</p><p>“Fuck, you’re perfect,” Rio said, her voice low and rough. Her eyes were warm on Agatha’s skin, her hands firm on Agatha’s waist.</p><p>Agatha just moaned in response, tightening her legs around Rio, lifting her hips to meet every thrust.</p><p>When Rio shifted her hips slightly, changing the angle, Agatha came completely undone.</p><p>She cried out as pleasure spiked through her, sharp and overwhelming, making her shake and clench and lose herself completely. She could feel her body pulsing around the toy, could feel her hips straining up against Rio’s, her fingers clutching at her shoulders. She was dimly aware that she was saying Rio’s name over and over, the word like a mantra, a prayer, a plea.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop, didn’t let up for even a second, her thrusts steady and controlled as Agatha shook apart beneath her.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t sure how long it lasted. She was lost in the sensation, lost in the blinding pleasure, lost in Rio.</p><p>Eventually, though, the sensations started to ease, the pleasure becoming a warm hum of sensation, an overwhelming feeling of fullness. Agatha sagged back into the bed, her grip on Rio loosening.</p><p>When Rio came, it was with Agatha’s name on her lips. Agatha could feel the muscles in Rio’s arms flexing, her grip tightening on Agatha’s hip. “Agatha,” she said again, and there was so much raw honesty in the way she said it, so much naked emotion, that it made Agatha’s heart seize in her chest.</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to Rio’s breast, to her sternum, to the base of her throat, holding her gaze the whole time.</p><p>“Holy shit,” she managed, her eyes closed, her chest rising and falling rapidly as she caught her breath. Her entire body was tingling, her nerves alight, her mind quiet and sated.</p><p>Rio shifted, gently sliding out of her. Agatha made a low noise at the loss, her muscles clenching at the sensation. “Okay?” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha nodded without opening her eyes.</p><p>Rio pressed a soft kiss to her shoulder, then another to her collarbone, then her sternum. “I’m going to take this off. Is that okay?” Her fingers brushed over the harness.</p><p>Agatha made a noise of agreement, her eyes still closed. She heard Rio moving, heard the soft clink of the buckles being undone. When Rio came back, she slid her arms beneath Agatha, pulling the sheet up over her and rolling her into the cradle of Rio’s body.</p><p>Agatha felt wrung out and sated and deliciously warm, her whole body humming with pleasure. She turned her head to nuzzle her face against Rio’s neck and breathed her in — something about Rio’s scent instantly soothed her.</p><p>She could feel Rio’s arms around her, holding her securely, Rio’s breath on her shoulder. She could feel Rio’s legs tangled with hers, her chest pressed against Rio’s, skin to skin.</p><p>Agatha had never felt so safe, so comforted, so completely taken care of. It scared her how much she didn’t want Rio to let go.</p><p>“I love you so much,” Agatha said finally, breaking the silence between them. Her voice was still rough from pleasure.</p><p>Rio was quiet for a moment, her fingertips running in soothing lines up and down Agatha’s spine. When she spoke, her voice was soft, sincere. “And I’ll love you forever.”</p><p>Agatha just sighed, unable to put words to what she was feeling. She tightened her grip on Rio, pulling her closer, holding her like she might slip away.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
Sunday put Agatha on the late shift, which she’d greeted with muted relief when she first saw the schedule. It felt safer than an early start, easier to recover from the faint throb behind her eyes that suggested the last Christmas cocktail the night before had been one too many.</p><p>Still, the feeling followed her.</p><p>It settled low in her chest as soon as she stepped through the hospital doors — a subtle, unwelcome tightness that made her slow half a step without knowing why. The air felt heavier than usual. Charged. Agatha shook it off immediately, irritation flaring at herself. Lack of sleep. Residual alcohol. Nothing more.</p><p>She was not someone given to superstition.</p><p>The surgical floor was already awake when she arrived, fluorescent lights buzzing faintly overhead, the familiar scent of antiseptic and stale coffee grounding her in routine. The unease lingered anyway, threading through her as she walked, like her body had registered something her mind hadn’t caught up to yet.</p><p>Teen was at the nurses’ station, animated as ever, hands moving as he spoke. Wanda stood opposite him, posture slack with exhaustion, coffee clasped in both hands like a lifeline.</p><p>“And then she starts yelling that we’re all incompetent,” Teen was saying. “Full volume. Security had to come up at one point because she was threatening staff.”</p><p>Agatha approached, eyes already scanning the board, trying to settle into the familiar rhythm of work. The dread eased just a fraction. This, she understood.</p><p>“Mmm,” she hummed in acknowledgement, barely listening. Difficult patients were nothing new.</p><p>Teen noticed her then and straightened. “Oh — morning, Dr. Harkness.”</p><p>“Morning,” Agatha replied automatically, fingers already reaching for her tablet.</p><p>“She’s been… a lot,” Teen continued, emboldened by the audience. “Honestly, some people are just mean for sport. Especially with that last name.”</p><p>Something inside Agatha went cold.</p><p>Not sharply. Not all at once. Just enough to make her still.</p><p>Wanda noticed immediately, eyes flicking to Agatha’s face.</p><p>Teen, meanwhile, realised his mistake far too late. Colour rushed to his cheeks. “I—I didn’t mean— I mean not <em>you</em>, obviously, I just—”</p><p>Agatha turned slowly.</p><p>“What do you mean,” she asked, voice calm to the point of being dangerous, “<em>that last name</em>?”</p><p>Teen swallowed. “I—well—it’s just—”</p><p>“Teen,” Agatha said gently, firmly. “Tell me.”</p><p>He hesitated, then gestured weakly toward the chart rack. “The patient in ninety-eight. She’s been causing a scene all night. Screaming at staff. Refusing treatment.” He winced. “Ms. Harkness.”</p><p>The dread snapped into focus.</p><p>Agatha felt it hit her like a physical blow, air leaving her lungs in a sharp, involuntary breath. She reached out without thinking, fingers closing around the chart Teen was holding.</p><p>Wanda stepped closer at once. “Agatha?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>She flipped the chart open, eyes moving fast, clinical instinct overriding shock for just long enough to process the words. Oncology consult. Behavioural flags. History of noncompliance.</p><p>Then the name.</p><p>EVANORA HARKNESS</p><p>For a second, the noise of the ward receded entirely. Agatha’s vision narrowed, the letters on the page blurring at the edges as if they were burning straight through her.</p><p>She dropped the chart.</p><p>It hit the counter with a sharp crack before sliding to the floor, pages splaying open like something exposed.</p><p>Wanda’s hand hovered near Agatha’s arm, not quite touching. “Agatha,” she said softly. “What’s going on?”</p><p>Agatha stared at the fallen chart, chest tight, pulse pounding in her ears. Memories surged unbidden — cold rooms, sharp words, absence dressed up as discipline.</p><p>She forced herself to breathe.</p><p>“Room ninety-eight,” she said at last, voice low and stripped of warmth. “Who’s covering her?”</p><p>Teen shook his head slowly. “No one permanent. She’s… difficult.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once.</p><p>“I’ll take it,” she said.</p><p>Wanda’s eyes widened. “Agatha—”</p><p>“I’ll take it,” Agatha repeated, bending to retrieve the chart, fingers gripping it too tightly.</p><p>She straightened, her composure snapping back into place with practiced precision. Spine straight. <br/>
Expression neutral. Mask firmly locked on.</p><p>But Wanda saw it — the tension beneath the surface, the way Agatha’s jaw was set too tight, her eyes too sharp.</p><p>Agatha turned toward the corridor without another word, Evanora’s name echoing in her head with every step.</p><p>The dread she’d felt upon entering the hospital finally made sense.</p><p>Some ghosts didn’t stay buried.</p><p>And this one had just checked herself in.</p>

<p>The walk to room ninety-eight felt interminable.</p><p>Agatha had made the journey down that corridor hundreds of times, could have navigated it blindfolded, but tonight every step stretched, heavy and deliberate, like she was wading through something viscous. </p><p>Her badge brushed soft against her coat with each movement, a small, grounding sound she clung to more than she liked.</p><p>In the space between the nurses’ station and the door, she cycled through emotions so quickly it was almost dizzying.</p><p>Anger came first—hot and immediate. A sharp flare at the audacity of Evanora’s presence here, in <em>her</em> hospital, demanding attention, mistreating staff, wearing the same last name like a provocation.</p><p>Confusion followed close behind. The dissonance of it all. The fact that Evanora was here at all. Sick. <br/>Mortal. Reduced to a patient in a bed instead of the omnipotent force Agatha’s memories insisted she was.</p><p>Annoyance crept in next, brittle and defensive. At fate. At herself. For agreeing to take the case instead of doing the sensible thing and handing it off, putting as much professional and emotional distance between herself and that woman as possible.</p><p>Then fear.</p><p>It arrived quietly, insidiously, coiling low in her chest. Not fear of Evanora as she was now, but fear of what she had been. Of how easily her presence could still drag Agatha backward into old patterns, old wounds. Fear that no amount of titles or authority could fully protect her from becoming that smaller, quieter version of herself again.</p><p>And finally—numbness.</p><p>By the time she reached the door, something inside her had gone very still.</p><p>Agatha paused, hand hovering just short of the handle, and leaned slightly to peer through the narrow window set into the door.</p><p>The room was dim, lit mostly by the weak glow of the city beyond the rain-streaked glass. Evanora sat upright in the bed, turned away, her profile sharp against the grey light. Rain lashed the window in uneven sheets, the sound faint but persistent even through the thick hospital glass.</p><p>From this angle, Agatha could see it clearly.</p><p>Evanora was smaller.</p><p>Her shoulders sloped inward now, no longer squared with authority. Her neck looked thinner, her skin almost translucent beneath the harsh lighting. The woman who had once seemed to loom over Agatha’s entire world now looked… diminished. Frail, even, in a way that felt both unsettling and deeply disorienting.</p><p>Agatha’s memories had never allowed for this version of her.</p><p>In her mind, Evanora was always towering. A looming presence that filled rooms and silences alike. <br/>Hands that could grip an arm too tightly, fingers that could twist painfully into hair to enforce obedience.</p><p>A voice that cut and controlled with precision, leaving no room for resistance.</p><p>Seeing her like this made Agatha’s stomach twist.</p><p>She straightened, drawing in a slow, measured breath, feeling it expand her chest, anchor her where she stood. The professional mask slid into place almost automatically, years of practice making the motion seamless.</p><p><em>What are you doing?</em> she thought, not unkindly, but honestly. <em>You should have handed this off.</em></p><p>She knew that. Had known it the moment she’d read the name on the chart. Distance was safer. Distance was cleaner. Distance was what she would have advised anyone else in her position to take.</p><p>Instead, here she was.</p><p>Standing outside the room of the woman who had destroyed her childhood, about to step back into her orbit of her own free will.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a brief moment, then opened them again, resolve settling in where fear had been.</p><p>Whatever happened next, she would<em> not</em> be that child again.</p><p>She placed her hand on the door.</p><p>Her fingers barely brushed the handle when a hand landed on her shoulder.</p><p>Firm. Grounding. Unmistakably real.</p><p>Agatha startled, breath hitching sharply as her body reacted before her mind caught up. She hadn’t heard anyone approach — she’d been too deep inside her own head, too focused on the battle she was bracing herself for.</p><p>She turned slowly.</p><p>Chief Romanoff stood behind her, expression set with calm determination, posture squared in a way that brooked no argument. Wanda was beside her, eyes wide and slightly out of breath, her concern so naked it almost hurt to look at.</p><p>“Agatha,” Natasha said gently, but with an authority that left no room for misinterpretation, “I think it’s best you give me the patient’s chart and step away from the door.”</p><p>Her voice was even. Careful. The kind of tone used when someone was standing too close to the edge.<br/>Agatha stared at her as if through water.</p><p>She didn’t move.<br/> Didn’t speak.</p><p>Her hand remained curled around the door handle, knuckles whitening as if letting go might send her tumbling.</p><p>“Agatha, <em>please</em>,” Wanda said softly.</p><p>That did it.</p><p>Something in Agatha’s gaze shifted — awareness flooding back in all at once, like surfacing too quickly. She blinked, chest rising sharply as she took in the scene properly this time: the two women in front of her, the quiet hallway, the door she had been seconds away from opening.</p><p>The reality of it landed all at once.</p><p>What she had almost done.</p><p>She loosened her grip on the handle slowly, fingers trembling as they fell away. Her arm dropped to her side, suddenly heavy.</p><p>“I—” Her voice faltered. She cleared her throat, trying again. “I can handle it.”</p><p>Natasha didn’t argue. She simply held Agatha’s gaze, steady and unflinching. “I know you think you can,” she said quietly. “That doesn’t mean you should.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>If they hadn’t stopped her — if she had gone in there alone — would she really have been able to keep her composure? Would she have stood her ground against the woman who had made her childhood a battlefield? Against the woman who had abandoned her without looking back?</p><p>Or would she have crumbled the moment Evanora opened her mouth?</p><p>The thought made her stomach twist.</p><p>Wanda stepped closer, her voice barely above a whisper. “You don’t have to do this.”</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders sagged, just a fraction, the fight draining out of her all at once. The certainty she’d felt moments ago dissolved into something shakier, more honest.</p><p>“No,” she admitted quietly. “I don’t.”</p><p>Natasha extended her hand. “Give me the chart.”</p><p>After a beat — one last, lingering glance at the door — Agatha did.</p><p>As the folder left her hands, it felt like relinquishing something dangerous. Not responsibility. Protection.</p><p>Natasha nodded once, decisive. “I’ll reassign the case.”</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realised she’d been holding, her legs suddenly unsteady beneath her.</p><p>The door to room ninety-eight remained closed and Agatha felt the memories crash over her once again.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Rio didn’t think much of the lack of replies at first.</p><p>Agatha had long shifts. Impossible ones. There were days when she disappeared into surgery and emerged hours later with a single apologetic text and a heart emoji, like a breadcrumb left behind to say <em>I’m still here</em>. Rio trusted that. Trusted <em>her</em>.</p><p>So when her first message went unanswered, Rio shrugged it off, slid her phone back into her pocket, and got on with her shift.</p><p>The second one, too.</p><p>By the third hour, she’d started checking her phone a little more often than necessary, thumb hovering over Agatha’s name before she caught herself and forced it down. <em>She’s busy</em>, Rio told herself. She’s fine.</p><p>But five hours in, the silence stopped feeling neutral.</p><p>It sat wrong in her chest, a low, persistent pressure that didn’t ease no matter how much she tried to distract herself. Even on Agatha’s worst days, even when she was slammed and exhausted and running on fumes, she always found a second to check in. A single emoji. A <em>sorry my love, it’s been hectic. </em><br/>Something.</p><p>This was nothing.</p><p>By the time Rio clocked out, she didn’t hesitate.</p><p>She didn’t go home. Didn’t sit in her truck to think it through. She turned the key and drove straight toward the hospital, hands tight on the steering wheel, jaw clenched as the sky began to lighten at the edges.</p><p>The sun was just starting to rise when she pulled into the hospital parking lot, the early morning light pale and unfotgiving. Agatha was due to finish in about an hour. Rio told herself she was just stopping by. Just checking in. Maybe surprising her with coffee. Maybe walking her out when her shift ended.</p><p>That was the story she stuck to as she shut off the engine.</p><p>But her chest still felt tight as she crossed toward the entrance.</p><p>The emergency department was quieter than usual. No line spilling out into the waiting area. No agitated pacing. No raised voices. If anything, it felt oddly subdued, like the building itself was holding something in.</p><p>That made it worse.</p><p><em>So why haven’t I heard from you?</em> Rio thought, unease sharpening into something colder.</p><p>She was almost inside when she spotted Wanda near the exit, jacket half on, shoulders slumped with exhaustion as she rummaged through her bag. Rio slowed, relief flaring briefly at the familiar sight.</p><p>“Hey, Wands,” Rio called gently. “Have you seen Agatha anywhere?”</p><p>Wanda looked up, surprised, a tired smile flickering across her face before it faded just as quickly.</p><p>“Oh—hey, Rio.”</p><p>Something in her expression tightened.</p><p>Wanda glanced around the department, then reached out, guiding Rio by the arm around the corner, away from the nurses’ station and the few lingering staff. That small, deliberate movement set off every alarm Rio had.</p><p>“Actually,” Wanda said quietly, “she went home a couple of hours ago.”</p><p>Rio stopped short. “She did?”</p><p>Wanda nodded, her mouth pressing into a thin line. “There was… an incident.”</p><p>Rio felt her stomach drop.</p><p>“A patient came in last night,” Wanda continued, choosing her words carefully. “She caused a bit of a scene. Security got involved. At first I thought the name was just a coincidence.”</p><p>She hesitated, then looked Rio square in the eyes.</p><p>“It wasn’t.”</p><p>Rio’s breath left her in a rush. “What do you mean?”</p><p>Wanda swallowed. “It’s her birth mother. She’s here.”</p><p>The world seemed to tilt.</p><p>Rio felt the colour drain from her face, her mind racing to keep up. She knew pieces of Agatha’s past — enough to understand how catastrophic this was. Enough to know this wasn’t just <em>difficult</em>.</p><p>It was devastating.</p><p>“Oh shit,” Rio whispered.</p><p>“Agatha tried to brush it off,” Wanda said. “Tried to take the case herself. Nat stopped her. Thank god she did.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes briefly, jaw tightening.<em> Of course she tried to handle it alone</em>.</p><p>“She took off not long after that,” Wanda finished. “Didn’t really say where she was going.”</p><p>Rio nodded slowly, heart pounding now, worry tipping into something sharper and more urgent.</p><p>“Did she… did she seem okay?” Rio asked, though she already knew the answer.</p><p>Wanda’s expression softened, sad and knowing. “You know how she is. She said she was fine.”</p><p>That answer told Rio everything.</p><p>“But,” Wanda added quietly, “she was shaken. More than she wanted to admit.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, forcing herself to stay upright, to stay steady. “Thanks, Wanda.”</p><p>“Of course,” Wanda said, squeezing her arm gently. “Let me know how she is, yeah?”</p><p>“I will,” Rio promised.</p><p>She turned back toward the exit, already pulling her phone out again, thumb hovering over Agatha’s name as her thoughts raced.</p><p><em>Where did you go? </em></p><p><em>Are you alone? </em></p><p><em>Why didn’t you call me?</em></p><p>One thing was painfully clear now.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t just left work early.</p><p>She’d run.</p><p>And Rio was going to find her.</p><p>Rio headed straight for Lilia’s.</p><p>There was no real debate in her mind about it. If Agatha was hurting — if she was shaken enough to leave work without a word — she would gravitate toward the place that had always meant safety. Toward Lilia. <br/>Toward familiarity and quiet and someone who loved her without conditions.</p><p>The drive felt longer than it should have.</p><p>Rio’s thoughts spiralled despite her best efforts to keep them in check. Images rose unbidden — Agatha as she’d described her childhood in fragments and half-sentences, the careful way she avoided certain memories, the way she brushed off pain with humour or silence. Rio knew that pattern too well now. <br/>Knew how quickly Agatha folded inward when old wounds were touched.</p><p><em>She’ll say she’s fine</em>, Rio thought grimly. <em>She always does.</em></p><p>She bit her lip hard enough to sting, grounding herself as the house came into view.</p><p>By the time she pulled up outside Lilia’s, her heart sank further. Agatha’s sleek black Mercedes wasn’t there. The driveway was empty save for Lilia’s car. But the kitchen lights were on, warm and steady, and Rio could see Lilia’s silhouette moving inside, familiar and comforting in a way that only made the absence sharper.</p><p>Rio climbed out of the truck slowly, dread pooling heavier with each step toward the door.</p><p>She knocked softly.</p><p>A moment later, the door opened and Lilia smiled, the same warm, welcoming expression she always wore when Rio came by.</p><p>“Rio, dear, what—” Lilia began.</p><p>Then she really looked at her.</p><p>The smile faded instantly.</p><p>Lilia’s eyes softened with concern, her posture shifting as she took in Rio’s tense shoulders, the worry etched plainly across her face.</p><p>“Oh,” Lilia said quietly. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>“She’s not here, is she?” Rio asked, her voice tight. She already knew the answer.</p><p>Lilia shook her head slowly. “No,” she said. “What’s happened?”</p><p>She stepped aside without another word, ushering Rio into the house. The familiar scent of coffee and herbs wrapped around her, but it did little to ease the knot in her chest.</p><p>Rio didn’t bother sitting.</p><p>“She hasn’t answered any of my texts since last night,” Rio said, words spilling out now that she’d started. “I thought she was just busy, but it kept going. I went to the hospital this morning. Wanda was there.”</p><p>Lilia’s expression grew more serious, her attention sharpening.</p><p>“She said Agatha left early,” Rio continued. “There was a patient admitted. Someone with her last name. I guess they thought it was a coincidence at first.”</p><p>Lilia went very still.</p><p>“But,” Rio said, swallowing hard, “it wasn’t.”</p><p>Silence fell heavy between them.</p><p>“It’s Evanora,” Rio finished. “She’s here. In the hospital.”</p><p>Lilia’s face fell.</p><p>For a heartbeat, she looked older somehow — lines deepening, shoulders stiffening as if bracing against something long-buried. Then anger flared across her features, raw and unmistakable.</p><p>“Oh,” Lilia said, her voice low and dangerous. “That woman.”</p><p>She turned away abruptly and began to pace, movements sharp and restless. The calm, measured presence Rio knew so well fractured completely, replaced by something fierce and incandescent. Twenty years of restraint snapped all at once.</p><p>Ebony lifted her head from her spot on the floor, ears flicking in confusion as she watched Lilia stride back and forth.</p><p>“She has no right,” Lilia muttered. “No right to show her face again. Not after—”</p><p>She stopped herself, dragging a hand through her hair, breath coming faster now.</p><p>Rio watched, startled. She had never seen Lilia like this — never seen her lose her composure, never seen such unfiltered rage aimed at anyone.</p><p>“She tried to take the case herself,” Rio said quietly. “Nat stopped her.”</p><p>“Thank god,” Lilia snapped. “Thank god someone did.”</p><p>She turned back to Rio, eyes blazing. “Agatha always thinks she has to face things alone. Always. She learned that from<em> her</em>.”</p><p>The word her dripped with contempt.</p><p>Rio nodded, chest aching. “I don’t know where she went,” she said. </p><p>Lilia’s anger softened into something like fear then, worry cutting through the fury.</p><p>“No,” she said slowly. “If she didn’t come here… then she doesn’t want to be seen like this.”</p><p>Rio’s stomach dropped.</p><p>They stood there together in the quiet kitchen, the weight of Agatha’s absence pressing down on them both.</p><p>“We’ll find her,” Lilia said at last, resolve settling in her voice even as her hands trembled faintly. “We will.”</p><p>Rio nodded, jaw set, determination burning hot beneath the fear pooling in her chest.</p><p>“I’m going to check my apartment,” she said. “Maybe she went there. I just figured you’d be the first place she came to, considering…”</p><p>She trailed off, not quite able to articulate the weight of what Agatha was carrying.</p><p>Lilia’s expression softened in a way that felt almost unbearably tender. She stepped closer and cupped Rio’s cheek, her thumb brushing gently along her jaw.</p><p>“My dear,” Lilia said quietly, “<em>you</em> are her safe place now.”</p><p>The words settled deep, heavy and affirming all at once.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard and nodded once, leaning briefly into the touch before pulling away. “I’ll call you,” <br/>she promised, already backing toward the door.</p><p>The drive back to her apartment was shorter, but no less frantic. Her thoughts churned relentlessly — please be there, please be there — even as another part of her knew better. Agatha didn’t hide where she might be found easily.</p><p>When Rio burst into the apartment, she nearly collided with Alice in the kitchen. Alice was standing in front of the counter in socks and an oversized hoodie, pouring cereal with the bleary focus of someone barely conscious.</p><p>“Oh—hey,” Alice mumbled. “You’re up early.”</p><p>“Have you seen Agatha?” Rio asked, already moving past her.</p><p>Alice blinked, processing. “Nah, dude. Haven’t seen her since—” She yawned. “—whenever you left last.”</p><p>Rio was already halfway down the hall.</p><p>She checked the bedroom. Empty. The bed untouched. The room cold in that unmistakable way that meant no one had slept there.</p><p>Her chest tightened.</p><p>She tried calling again as she stood in the doorway, thumb pressing the button with more force than necessary.</p><p>Straight to voicemail.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio murmured under her breath, frustration and fear bleeding together. “Where are you?”</p><p>She lowered the phone, pacing once, then stopping abruptly.</p><p><em>Think</em>, she told herself. <em>Where would she go if she didn’t want to be seen?</em></p><p>Not Lilia’s. </p><p>Not here.</p><p>Somewhere familiar. Somewhere quiet. Somewhere she could disappear without being alone.</p><p>The answer hit her all at once.</p><p>“Oh,” Rio breathed. “I’m an idiot.”</p><p>She spun on her heel and bolted for the door.</p><p>“Hey—where are you going?” Alice called after her, spoon halfway to her mouth.</p><p>“Out,” Rio said, already gone.</p><p>The irony twisted sharply in her chest as she drove — that the place she’d left was the place she’d needed to come back to all along.</p><p>The firehouse.</p><p><em>“This is where I go when the noise gets too loud.” </em><br/><em>“You can come up here whenever you want,”</em></p><p>Rio had told Agatha about the firehouse roof months ago, recommended it as a quiet place to escape.</p><p>Somewhere she didn’t have to explain herself.</p><p>Rio pulled up out back and didn’t bother parking properly. </p><p>She jumped out of the truck, heart pounding, and ran toward the rear entrance. The metal stairs rattled beneath her boots as she took them two at a time, breath burning in her lungs.</p><p>Please, please, please.<br/>At the top, she stopped short.</p><p>Agatha was there.</p><p>Curled into one of the old chairs they kept for overnight shifts, a thin blanket pulled tight around her shoulders. Her posture was folded inward, knees drawn up slightly, chin tucked down like she was trying to take up as little space as possible.</p><p>She looked impossibly small.</p><p>Not the brilliant surgeon.<br/> Not the sharp-witted woman who commanded rooms.</p><p>Just someone exhausted. Hurt. Trying to hold herself together.</p><p>Rio’s chest ailed with it.</p><p>She crossed the room quietly, as if loud movement might scare her off, every instinct screaming to gather her up, to shield her, to undo whatever damage had been done.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said softly.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up at first.</p><p>But when she did, Rio saw it immediately — the emptiness behind her eyes, the fragile, fractured composure she rarely let anyone witness.</p><p>Rio knelt in front of her without hesitation, hands gentle as they came to rest on Agatha’s knees.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” she said, voice steady even as her heart threatened to split open. “I’m here. Mi amor, look at me,” she coaxed softly, her thumb brushing beneath Agatha’s chin as she lifted her face.</p><p>Agatha’s skin felt cold.</p><p>That alone sent a sharp ache through Rio’s chest. Agatha always ran warm, always grounded in her body even when her mind raced. This—this distant stillness—was different.</p><p>When Agatha’s eyes finally met hers, Rio felt her breath catch.</p><p>They were unfocused, glassy, like she was looking through Rio instead of at her. Somewhere far away. </p><p>Somewhere Rio couldn’t follow without permission.</p><p>“Oh, baby,” Rio murmured, voice breaking just a little despite her best effort to keep it steady. “You’re not here, are you?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>Her lips parted as if she meant to speak, then closed again. Her shoulders curled inward instinctively, the blanket tightening around her like armour. She looked small. Not physically—Agatha was still all sharp lines and presence—but emotionally, folded in on herself, trying to survive the moment instead of live inside it.</p><p>Rio’s heart fractured at the sight.</p><p>She shifted closer, careful not to crowd her, one knee pressing gently against the chair, anchoring herself where Agatha could feel her. Rio kept one hand under Agatha’s chin, the other resting lightly on her knee, a constant, grounding point.</p><p>“You don’t have to talk,” Rio said quietly. “You don’t have to explain anything. I just need you here with me, okay?”</p><p>Agatha’s throat worked.</p><p>“I—” she started, then stopped. Her jaw trembled faintly, the tiniest betrayal of how hard she was holding herself together.</p><p>Rio leaned in until their foreheads touched, breathing slowly on purpose, deep and even. She knew this—knew how dissociation felt, how the body retreated when the past became too loud.</p><p>“Breathe with me,” Rio whispered. “Just for a second.”</p><p>She inhaled deliberately.</p><p>Agatha didn’t follow at first.</p><p>So Rio stayed. Didn’t rush. Didn’t fill the silence with reassurances that Agatha wasn’t ready to believe. She just breathed again, steady and patient, until finally—barely—Agatha’s chest rose in a shallow imitation.</p><p>“There you go,” Rio said softly. “That’s it.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered, focus sharpening by degrees. The faraway look receded just enough for recognition to take hold.</p><p>“Rio,” she whispered, voice hoarse.</p><p>The sound of her name nearly undid Rio entirely.</p><p>“I’m here,” Rio replied instantly. “I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>Agatha’s composure cracked then—not dramatically, not all at once—but in a quiet collapse that felt somehow worse. Her shoulders sagged, the tension draining out of her body like she’d finally run out of strength to keep standing.</p><p>“She—” Agatha swallowed hard. “She’s here.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio said gently. “Wanda told me.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head weakly. “I wasn’t ready. I thought I was. I thought—” Her breath hitched. “I thought I could be… someone else.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened, anger flaring briefly on Agatha’s behalf before she forced it down. This wasn’t about rage. This was about holding her.</p><p>“You don’t have to be anyone else,” Rio said firmly, but softly. “Not with me.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes filled, finally, tears clinging stubbornly to her lashes. She looked ashamed of them, like they were another failure she hadn’t planned for.</p><p>Rio cupped her face fully now, thumbs brushing beneath her eyes without wiping them away. “Hey,” she murmured. “None of that. Don’t apologise for being hurt.”</p><p>Agatha let out a broken breath that sounded suspiciously like a sob.</p><p>“She —” Agatha’s voice faltered completely this time. “She did such awful things Rio”</p><p>Rio pressed her forehead more firmly against Agatha’s, grounding them both. “You don’t have to tell me everything,” she replied. “But you can. Whenever you’re ready.”</p><p>Agatha leaned into her then, finally giving up the fight to stay upright. Her head tipped forward until it rested against Rio’s shoulder, fingers clutching weakly at the fabric of Rio’s jacket like she was afraid she might vanish.</p><p>Rio wrapped her arms around her fully, slow and certain, pulling Agatha close enough that she could feel her heartbeat.</p><p>“You’re safe,” Rio whispered into her hair. “You’re with me. I’ve got you.”</p><p>Rio stayed exactly where she was.</p><p>She didn’t loosen her hold when Agatha’s fingers curled tighter into her jacket. Didn’t flinch when Agatha’s breath broke again, sharper this time, the sound of someone who had been holding herself together for far too long and had finally reached the limit of that strength.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio murmured, the words steady even as her own chest ached. “I’ve got you. I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha shook against her, a small, involuntary movement, like her body was trying to decide whether it was safe to fall apart. Rio shifted carefully, angling herself so Agatha could lean more fully into her. One arm wrapped around Agatha’s shoulders, the other cradled the back of her head, fingers threading gently through her hair.</p><p>Agatha let out a sound that wasn’t quite a sob, but close enough that it made Rio’s throat tighten painfully.</p><p>“I didn’t even go in,” Agatha whispered finally, her voice muffled against Rio’s shoulder. “I thought I could. I told myself I was ready and then—” She swallowed hard. “I froze.”</p><p>Rio closed her eyes briefly, relief and heartbreak crashing together. “That doesn’t mean you failed,” she said immediately. “That means you listened to yourself.”</p><p>Agatha gave a humourless huff. “I ran.”</p><p>“No,” Rio said, firmer now, though still gentle. She leaned back just enough to look at Agatha’s face again, making sure she had her attention. “You protected yourself. There’s a difference.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes were red-rimmed now, unfocused but present. She looked unconvinced. “She still… wins,” she said quietly. “Just by existing.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. She brushed her thumb slowly along Agatha’s cheek, grounding, deliberate. “No,” she said. “She hurt you. That’s not winning. And it doesn’t erase who you are today, who you have become.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze dropped again, shame flickering across her face like a reflex she couldn’t quite control. “She knows exactly what to say,” she admitted. “Even without seeing me. Just knowing she’s there… it’s like I’m twelve again.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Yeah,” she said softly. “Trauma doesn’t care how old you are now.”</p><p>That seemed to land.</p><p>Agatha sagged slightly, some of the fight leaving her shoulders. “I didn’t want you to see me like this,” she said. “I didn’t want… to bring this into us.”</p><p>Rio felt something fierce and protective rise in her chest.</p><p>“Hey,” she said, tilting Agatha’s face gently until she had to look at her. “This is part of you. That means it’s part of us whether we name it or not.” Her voice softened again. “And I don’t scare that easily.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips trembled. “You should.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No. I love you. That includes the mess. Especially the mess.”</p><p>Agatha stared at her, like she was trying to decide whether to believe it. Then, finally, she exhaled—a long, shaky breath that felt like surrender.</p><p>“I don’t think I can go home yet,” she admitted.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said immediately. No hesitation. “Then we don’t.”</p><p>She glanced around the quiet room, the early morning light creeping in through the high windows. “We can stay here a minute longer. Or we can go somewhere else. Your call.”</p><p>Agatha considered it, then nodded faintly. “I don’t want to be alone.”</p><p>Rio tightened her arms around her. “You won’t be.”</p><p>She shifted carefully, easing Agatha up just enough that she could sit more comfortably, still tucked close, still supported. Agatha leaned into her again without resistance this time, her weight trusting, heavy in a way that spoke of exhaustion rather than fear.</p><p>Rio pressed a soft kiss into Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“We’ll take this one step at a time,” she said quietly. “You don’t have to be strong today. I’ll do that part.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes, forehead resting against Rio’s collarbone.</p><p>For the first time since disappearing, her breathing evened out.</p><p>And Rio stayed there with her, holding the space steady, until the worst of the storm passed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>Back at the hospital, Lilia arrived with purpose.</p><p>She wore her softest cardigan, the one staff always commented on, and carried a canvas tote filled with neatly folded, freshly knitted hats in pastel colours. A gift for the neonatal unit — something she’d planned to do in a few weeks’ time, but today felt… appropriate. Necessary. It gave her a reason to be here that no one would question.</p><p>She smiled. </p><p>She thanked people. </p><p>She accepted gratitude with gracious nods and warm words.</p><p>No one noticed that the tote wasnt empty when she left the unit.</p><p>By the time she reached the surgical wing, Lilia moved differently.</p><p>Her steps were quiet. Measured. Her posture loose in a way that suggested calm, but her eyes were sharp now, scanning room numbers with surgical precision. She wasn’t angry in a loud way. She was focused.</p><p>There was only one destination.</p><p>Room 98.</p><p>Lilia stopped outside the door for half a second — not to hesitate, but to listen. The room was quiet save for the steady beep of monitors and the faint sound of wind against glass.</p><p>She entered without knocking.</p><p>Evanora lay propped up in the bed, thinner than Lilia remembered, her skin sallow under the hospital lights. She turned her head as the door closed, irritation already forming before she could place the visitor.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.<br/>She studied Lilia’s face, searching memory.<br/>Then something clicked.</p><p>“…Lilia?” Evanora said, surprise threading through the word.</p><p>Lilia smiled.</p><p>It was polite. Controlled. Entirely devoid of warmth.</p><p>“Yes,” she said softly. “Hello, Evanora.”</p><p>Before Evanora could speak again, Lilia’s hand dipped into her tote with a smooth, practiced motion. In one fluid movement, she stepped forward and pressed a long, sharp knitting needle beneath Evanora’s chin — not enough to pierce skin, but enough that the pressure was unmistakable.</p><p>Enough that Evanora froze.</p><p>Lilia leaned down, bringing her face level with Evanora’s, her voice dropping to a near whisper.</p><p>“If you raise your voice,” Lilia said calmly, “or call for help, or so much as flinch, I<em> will</em> hurt you.”</p><p>Evanora’s breath hitched.</p><p>Lilia continued, eyes burning now. “I won’t kill you. That would be far too easy.”</p><p>She adjusted the pressure slightly — just enough to make the point crystal clear.</p><p>“But I will make myself unforgettable.”</p><p>Evanora swallowed hard, her bravado evaporating under the weight of Lilia’s gaze.</p><p>“You left a <em>child</em>,” Lilia said, every word measured. “A twelve-year-old girl. On my doorstep. With no explanation and no intention of ever coming back.”</p><p>Evanora scoffed weakly. “She was difficult—”</p><p>The needle pressed closer.</p><p>“She was <em>brilliant</em>,” Lilia snapped quietly. “And terrified. And still desperate for you.”</p><p>Her voice trembled now, but she didn’t pull away.</p><p>“You do not get to come back into her life,” Lilia said, “and you do not get to harm her again. Not with words. Not with looks. Not with your existence.”</p><p>Evanora’s eyes darted around the room, searching for an escape that didn’t exist.</p><p>“If I hear,” Lilia continued, “that you asked for her by name, or complained about her, or so much as acknowledged her presence again—”</p><p>She smiled then. Not kindly.</p><p>“I will make sure every single person who matters knows exactly who you are.”</p><p>She leaned closer still. “And believe me, Evanora, I have<em> a lot</em> of friends in this town”</p><p>Slowly, deliberately, Lilia removed the needle and slipped it back into her tote.</p><p>She straightened, smoothing her cardigan as if nothing had happened.</p><p>Evanora lay rigid, breathing shallowly, eyes wide with fear and fury.</p><p>Lilia looked down at her one last time.</p><p>“You don’t get to ruin her,” she said softly. “That privilege is gone.”</p><p>Then she turned and left the room, footsteps once again light and unhurried.</p><p>Outside, she paused only long enough to steady herself.</p><p>For Agatha.</p><p>Always.</p>

<p>The rooftop had changed while they sat there.</p><p>What had started as a pale, grey morning had slowly bled into late afternoon, the light thinning and cooling until the town below looked washed in steel and shadow. One by one, small points of warmth began to glow beneath them — strings of Christmas lights flickering on along shopfronts, windows, and lampposts, tentative at first, then steady. Soft colour crept back into the streets, red and gold and green pushing gently against the cold. The wind had picked up too, sneaking through the gaps between buildings, curling around exposed skin with quiet persistence.</p><p>Rio noticed long before Agatha did.</p><p>She noticed the way the cold crept in, the way Agatha’s shoulders tensed almost imperceptibly, the way her fingers curled tighter into the fabric of Rio’s sleeve as if her body was bracing for something even her mind hadn’t caught up to yet. Rio had learned, over the last few months, to read those signs the same way she read smoke patterns or strutctural shifts, like small warnings that mattered.</p><p>She didn’t say anything at first.</p><p>Agatha was still pressed close to her side, gaze unfocused, breathing steady but shallow, like she was conserving energy just to stay present. Like every breath was a deliberate choice. Rio felt the weight of her there, not heavy, but real, and something protective settled deep in her chest. This wasn’t a moment to fill with words. </p><p>This was a moment to just be present for Agatha.</p><p>She shifted subtly, angling her body so she took the brunt of the wind, her arm firm around Agatha’s shoulders. She could feel the chill seeping in anyway, could feel how Agatha leaned into her without even realising she was doing it. The trust in that—unthinking, instinctive—made Rio’s throat tighten.</p><p>Eventually, quietly, Rio stood.</p><p>“I’ll be right back,” she murmured, already shrugging off her jacket and tucking it more securely around Agatha’s shoulders. The motion felt almost reverent. As if she were wrapping something fragile instead of a woman who had survived more than most people ever knew.</p><p>Agatha nodded faintly, trusting, eyes never leaving the skyline.</p><p>Rio moved fast, the cold biting sharper now that she’d stepped away. She slipped back inside the firehouse, heart still tethered to the spot she’d left, and returned a minute later with a thick station blanket tucked under one arm and two mismatched mugs in the other. Steam curled up immediately, fragrant and sweet.</p><p>Hot cocoa. Extra sugar. A small comfort against the December chill. Something her abuela would have done.</p><p>As she crossed back toward Agatha, Rio felt a strange mix of things swirl together, relief that she could do something useful, fear that it wouldn’t be enough, and a quiet, steady resolve that surprised even her.</p><p>She couldn’t fix what had been done.</p><p>But she could be there for her.</p><p>Which, right now, felt like everything.</p><p>She draped the blanket around Agatha first, careful and deliberate, wrapping it snugly like she was sealing warmth into her bones. Agatha made a small sound of surprise, then leaned into it instinctively, fingers clutching the edge.</p><p>“M’lady,” Rio smiled, pressing the mug of hot cocoa into Agatha’s hands. “Careful. It’s hot.”</p><p>Agatha blinked down at it like she’d forgotten warmth could be held. She nodded once, fingers curling around the ceramic, absorbing the heat slowly.</p><p>Rio took her place beside her again, close enough that their shoulders and hips touched beneath the blanket. She didn’t suggest leaving. Didn’t comment on the cold or the time or the way Agatha’s nose was starting to pink.</p><p>She waited.</p><p>Minutes passed in companionable silence. The town hummed below them, distant sirens and traffic softened by height and air. Agatha sipped the cocoa absently, eyes still far away, but the tension in her body had eased just a little more.</p><p>Then something shifted.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head upward, brow furrowing faintly as she felt something cold brush her cheek.<br/>She blinked.</p><p>Another followed. Then another.</p><p>Snow.</p><p>Not the heavy kind, not yet. Just small flurries, soft, tentative flakes drifting lazily out of the sky like they were testing the idea of landing.</p><p>Agatha lifted her face fully now, watching them fall.</p><p>And then, finally she smiled.</p><p>It was small. Almost shy. But it was real.</p><p>It broke across her face like dawn, softening the hard lines grief and fear had etched there all day. Her shoulders relaxed, breath leaving her in a slow, awed exhale.</p><p>“Oh,” she murmured. “It’s snowing.”</p><p>Rio watched her, something warm blooming in her chest that had nothing to do with the blanket or the cocoa. </p><p>She took in the way Agatha’s eyes followed the flakes, the way the tension drained from her posture, the way the world seemed to narrow down to this quiet, beautiful moment. This was what she wanted to protect. This quiet, rare softness that Agatha gave so sparingly.</p><p>“It’s beautiful.” Agatha whispered.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said softly, her eyes not leaving Agatha’s now soft features. “It really is.”</p><p>Agatha held her mug closer, tilting her head back, letting the snow dust her lashes and melt against her skin. For the first time since Rio had found her, she looked <em>present</em>. Not braced. Not retreating.<br/>Just… here.</p><p>The love Rio felt in that moment was steady and consuming, the kind that didn’t demand or overwhelm but rooted itself quietly and refused to be shaken. She loved Agatha not for her strength alone, but for this too, for the vulnerability she trusted Rio enough to show.</p><p>Rio shifted closer, tucking the blanket tighter around them both, her arm warm and solid at Agatha’s side.<br/> She didn’t interrupt. Didn’t name the moment.</p><p>She waited until Agatha’s breathing had settled again, until the snow seemed to soften the edges of the city and the quiet felt earned.</p><p>Then, gently, “Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer right away.</p><p>She watched the snow fall for a long moment, lashes blinking slowly as flakes melted against them. </p><p>Rio followed her gaze, letting the silence stretch, reminding herself that this wasn’t something to hurry. This was Agatha choosing to speak at all. Rio felt a familiar, fierce protectiveness rise in her chest, not loud, not angry, but solid. </p><p>When Agatha  finally spoke, her voice was steady, but distant, like she was narrating something she’d lived with for years.</p><p>“I’ve thought about that moment for… twenty years,” she said.</p><p>Rio turned slightly toward her, attention narrowing completely.</p><p>“Every version of it,” Agatha continued. “What I’d say. How I’d stand. Whether I’d be calm or cruel or clinical.” A faint, humourless smile touched her mouth. “I had entire speeches prepared.”</p><p>Rio nodded, encouraging but silent.</p><p>“I imagined telling her she ruined me,” Agatha said quietly. “Or that I didn’t need her anymore. Or that I’d succeeded in spite of her.” She swallowed. “Sometimes I imagined saying nothing at all. Just… looking at her and letting her see what she walked away from.”</p><p>Her grip tightened on the mug.</p><p>“I thought if I planned it enough, it wouldn’t hurt,” she admitted. “Like preparation could make it barable.”</p><p>Rio felt her chest ache, but she didn’t interrupt.</p><p>“But when I saw her through the window,” Agatha said, her voice faltering for the first time, “my mind went completely blank.”</p><p>She shook her head slightly, as if still confused by it.</p><p>“There was no anger. No strength. Just this… awful, hollow recognition.” Her breath hitched. “Like my body remembered her before my mind could catch up.”</p><p>Rio’s hand tightened around her shoulder.</p><p>“She didn’t look like the monster I remembered,” Agatha went on. “She looked small. Frail. And somehow that made it worse.” Her jaw clenched. “Because it didn’t erase anything she did. It just… stripped away the excuse that I needed to hate her.”</p><p>She exhaled shakily.</p><p>“She used to leave me alone for days,” Agatha said softly. “Food on the counter if I was lucky. Notes telling me not to touch anything. Not to bother her.” Her voice stayed even, but her eyes burned. “I learned how to be quiet because noise annoyed her. I learned how to disappear because that was easier for her.”</p><p>Rio’s heart broke a little more with every word.</p><p>“I spent years thinking that if I was good enough, smart enough, useful enough, she’d come back,” Agatha whispered. “And when she didn’t… I decided it must have been my fault.”</p><p>She finally turned to look at Rio then, eyes raw and searching.</p><p>“So when I stood there today,” she said, “all I could think was — what if she looks at me and still doesn’t care?”</p><p>The snow fell softly between them.</p><p>Rio lifted Agatha’s hand, fingers threading together deliberately, anchoring her to the present. “She doesn’t get to define you,” Rio said gently. “She lost that right the moment she walked away.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, but her voice wavered. “I know that. Intellectually. But the child part of me still wants… something. An apology. A reason. Proof that I mattered.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her hand, grounding, certain. “I think that’s a reasonable thing to want,” she said quietly.</p><p>Agatha leaned into her, resting her forehead against Rio’s shoulder, the weight of the day finally pressing in now that she wasn’t holding herself upright alone. “I hate that she still has that power over me,” she admitted.</p><p>Rio pressed a soft kiss into Agatha’s hair, lingering there. “She doesn’t,” she said gently. “Not anymore.” She pulled back just enough to look at her. “Agatha, I think you’re the bravest person I’ve ever known.”</p><p>Agatha let out a small, sad laugh. “Rio, you risk your life every day. You’re surrounded by brave people.” She shook her head. “I’m not one of them.”</p><p>Rio turned fully toward her then, cupping her cheek so Agatha couldn’t look away. Her thumb brushed beneath Agatha’s eye, tender and deliberate. “Don’t do that,” she said softly. “Don’t shrink yourself because of what she did to you.”</p><p>Her voice warmed as she went on. “I love you. I love your strength. I love your stubborn determination.” A smile tugged at her mouth. “Hell, I even love when you’re mean.”</p><p>Agatha huffed, a wet chuckle breaking free as she wiped at her eyes. “Even though my nose is all snotty?”</p><p>Rio laughed, genuine and unrestrained, the sound cutting clean through the heaviness. “Especially your snotty, disgusting nose.”</p><p>Agatha laughed with her then, the sound fragile but real, and for a moment the weight of Evanora — of the past — loosened its grip just a little more.</p><p>Around them, the snow had stopped being tentative.</p><p>It gathered quietly now, settling into the folds of the blanket pooled across their laps, dusting Agatha’s knees and the toe of Rio’s boot in soft white. Every so often, a flake caught in Agatha’s hair and melted there, cold and fleeting, like the last remnants of something finally beginning to pass.</p><p>Agatha noticed it absently, brushing at the fabric once before letting her hand fall back into Rio’s. She took a slow breath, one that felt deliberate instead of reactive.</p><p>“I think…” she began, then paused, as if checking in with herself before continuing. “I think I’m ready to go.”</p><p>Rio turned her head slightly, searching Agatha’s face for any sign of hesitation. There wasn’t any. Just exhaustion. And resolve.</p><p>“Okay,” Rio said gently. </p><p>Agatha glanced down at the snow collecting on them and huffed out a quiet, almost fond laugh. “Before I turn into an icicle.”</p><p>Rio smiled. “Yeah, I didn’t wanna say anything but I lost sensation in my fingers ten minutes ago.”</p><p>She shifted carefully, brushing snow from the blanket and helping Agatha stand, keeping one hand at her back as they moved. Agatha swayed slightly, not from weakness so much as the weight of the day finally settling into her bones, and Rio steadied her without comment.</p><p>As they gathered their things, Rio spoke again, softly. “We should head to Lilia’s,” she suggested. “She’s probably been freaking out that I haven’t called her yet.”</p><p>Agatha considered it for only a moment before nodding. “Yeah,” she said. “I don’t want her worrying.”</p><p>Something eased in Rio’s chest at the agreement. She squeezed Agatha’s hand once, warm and reassuring. </p><p>“She’ll be really glad to see you.”</p><p>Agatha glanced back at the rooftop one last time, the quiet, the snow, the strange pocket of peace it had given her — then turned away without regret.</p><p>“Thank you,” she said quietly as they headed for the stairs. “For being here with me.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. “Always.”</p><p>She leaned in then, unable to resist, pressing a gentle kiss to Agatha’s lips, soft, unhurried, meant more as reassurance than anything else.</p><p>It lasted all of two seconds.</p><p>Agatha pulled back with a startled laugh, wiping at her nose. “Oh my god—sorry—”</p><p>Rio froze, then burst out laughing, the sound bright and unrestrained. “Hey,” she said between laughs, “I said always. That includes snotty kisses.”</p><p>Agatha laughed too, the tension dissolving completely now, embarrassment warming her cheeks. “You’re disgusting Vidal. Sweet, but disgusting.”</p><p>They descended together after that, still smiling, snow drifting lazily above the town as Rio helped Agatha into the truck.</p><p>As they drove through the quiet streets toward Lilia’s house, the cab of the truck still held a weight of unspoken things but it had shifted.</p><p>Agatha sat back in the passenger seat now, no longer quite so tightly curled in on herself. Her shoulders were still drawn forward, but her hands rested looser in her lap, fingers unclenched, the rigid tension from earlier softened by the small, shared laughter they’d left behind on the rooftop.</p><p>She hadn’t said much since they’d left the firehouse, but the silence felt different now. Less brittle. Less like she was holding herself together by sheer force of will.</p><p>Rio kept one hand on the wheel and the other resting lightly on Agatha’s thigh, a steady, reassuring presence rather than a demand. Agatha didn’t pull away. If anything, she leaned subtly into the touch, her knee angling closer, as if she’d finally given herself permission to accept the comfort being offered.</p><p>“Have you eaten yet?” Rio asked gently. “I can pick something up on the way?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, a little tired but genuine, and shook her head. “I’m not really hungry.”</p><p>Rio squeezed her thigh, the pressure affectionate but firm. “You still have to eat, <em>mi amor</em>.”</p><p>Agatha huffed softly. “I’m sure Lilia will force something on me the moment I walk through the door.”</p><p>Rio just hummed in response, eyes still on the road but Agatha knew that hum well enough to recognise it for what it was.</p><p>Rio wouldn’t truly relax until she’d seen Agatha eat something herself.</p><p>When they turned onto Lilia’s street, Rio slowed instinctively.</p><p>A maroon car sat parked along the curb.</p><p>Rio frowned, eyes flicking to it. “Huh,” she murmured. “Wonder who—”</p><p>“Shit. Why is Natasha here?” Agatha said quietly beside her.</p><p>Rio glanced over just in time to see Agatha’s face drain of colour.</p><p>“Oh God,” Agatha added, breath hitching. “I bet I’m fired, aren’t I?”</p><p>The words landed sharp and panicked.</p><p>“No,” Rio said immediately, squeezing Agatha’s thigh firmly. “No. Look at me. You’re not fired.”<br/>Agatha didn’t look convinced.</p><p>Rio pulled the truck into the driveway and turned off the engine. “You didn’t do anything wrong,” she said again, softer now but no less certain. “And if anyone has a problem with how today went, they’ll have to go through me.”</p><p>That earned a weak huff of a laugh from Agatha, but the tension didn’t leave her shoulders.</p><p>They were barely inside the house when Agatha heard her name.</p><p>Not spoken directly but <em>contained</em>.</p><p>“…I’m serious, Lilia,” Natasha was saying, her voice low, controlled, edged with authority. “You need to stay away from Evanora. Whatever happened today, whatever you said — it cannot happen again.”</p><p>Agatha stopped in the entryway.</p><p>Rio’s hand tightened around hers immediately, instinctive, grounding.</p><p>Lilia stood near the living room window, posture composed, hands folded neatly in front of her as if she were discussing the weather. Natasha faced her, coat still on, expression tight with concern and something sharper underneath.</p><p>“Oh come on Natasha, I didn’t do anything illegal,” Lilia replied calmly. “I simply just spoke to her.”</p><p>“You threatened a patient,” Natasha said evenly. “Enough that she’s made noise about feeling unsafe im my hospital.”</p><p>Lilia’s mouth curved into a polite smile that did not reach her eyes. “She has spent a lifetime making other people feel unsafe. I find it difficult to be moved by her discomfort.”</p><p>“Lilia,” Natasha warned.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened.</p><p>Natasha turned then — and saw them.</p><p>Her expression shifted instantly. “Agatha. Rio. I didn’t realise you were back.”</p><p>“It’s fine,” Agatha said quietly. Too quietly. “I heard.”</p><p>Lilia turned at once, all sharp edges softening. “My girl.”</p><p>Agatha stepped forward this time. “Am I in trouble?” she asked, voice level but thin.</p><p>Natasha shook her head immediately. “No. Absolutely not. You did nothing wrong.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, but the tension didn’t leave her shoulders. “Then why does it feel like everyone’s talking around me?”</p><p>Natasha hesitated, then chose honesty. “Because I’m now aware of the situation and history with you and our new patient, I just wanted to check in.”</p><p>Something cold settled in Agatha’s stomach.</p><p>Rio felt it and slid her arm more securely around Agatha’s waist.</p><p>“She’s made it very clear,” Natasha continued, “that she wants nothing to do with you medically. I’ve assigned Dr Kale to her care.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Okay”</p><p>“But,” Natasha added, gaze flicking briefly to Lilia, “she has complained. Vaguely. About feeling threatened.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes snapped to Lilia.</p><p>Lilia met her gaze steadily. “I reminded her of boundaries,” she said simply.</p><p>Natasha sighed. “Those boundaries need to be maintained from a distance.”</p><p>“Lilia will stay away from her” Agatha said immediately. “We both will.”</p><p>“I know,” Natasha said gently. “This isn’t about your restraint. It’s about preventing escalation.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice cooled. “You’re asking me to do nothing.”</p><p>“I’m asking you,” Natasha replied carefully, “to let the hospital handle her. To let <em>me</em> handle her.”</p><p>A beat.</p><p>Lilia studied her for a long moment and then nodded, slowly. “Very well.”</p><p>Natasha let out a breath she’d clearly been holding. “That’s all I needed to hear.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice softened. “She stays, but she stays <em>away</em> from me.”</p><p>“Yes,” Natasha said. “That’s the plan.”</p><p>Lilia placed a warm hand at Agatha’s back. “You are safe in this town,” she said firmly. “No matter who decides to pass through.”</p><p>Natasha tightened her coat. “I’ll check in tomorrow,” she said to Agatha. “As your colleague. Not your boss.”</p><p>Agatha met her eyes and nodded. “Thank you.”</p><p>Natasha returned the nod, already halfway to the door. Her hand was on the handle when Lilia spoke again, entirely too casually.</p><p>“Oh,” she added sweetly, “give Wanda my love, dear.”</p><p>The effect was immediate.</p><p>Rio made a strangled sound that she quickly turned into a cough, ducking her head. Agatha clapped a hand over her mouth, shoulders shaking as she very nearly lost the battle to stay quiet.</p><p>Natasha froze.</p><p>Slowly, she turned back around, colour blooming unmistakably across her cheeks. “I—” she began, then stopped, clearly realising there was no dignified recovery here.</p><p>Lilia just smiled at her, serene and mischievous all at once.</p><p>Natasha let out a breath, shook her head with a helpless, incredulous huff, and opened the door. “Goodnight, Lilia,” she said, pointed but fond.</p><p>“Goodnight, Chief,” Lilia replied, utterly pleased with herself.</p><p>The door closed softly behind Natasha, and for half a second the house was silent.</p><p>Then Rio burst out laughing, Agatha following a beat later, pressing her face briefly into Rio’s shoulder as she tried — and failed — to contain it.</p><p>Lilia turned back to them, smoothing her cardigan as if she hadn’t just dropped a conversational grenade. “What?” she asked innocently.</p><p>Agatha wiped at her eyes, still smiling. “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>Lilia’s smile only widened as she straightened, clasping her hands together as if resetting herself. “Well,” she said briskly, “I’ll get started on something to eat. Something tells me none of you have eaten in a while.” Her gaze flicked pointedly to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha shot Rio a brief I<em> told you so</em> look before following Lilia into the kitchen.</p><p>“Lilia,” she said, unable to help the edge in her voice, “are you going to tell me what happened at the hospital?”</p><p>Lilia waved a dismissive hand as she began pulling pots from the cupboard. “I merely told that old, decrepit cunt to stay away from you. That’s all.”</p><p>Agatha nearly choked on thin air.</p><p>In the twenty years she’d known Lilia, she could count on one hand the number of times she’d heard the woman swear. And now she’d dropped the <em>c-word</em> without so much as blinking.</p><p>Lilia turned when Agatha stayed silent, taking in the look of pure shock on her face. “Oh, sweetheart,” she said mildly, “do you really think that’s the worst thing I could call her? You’d be appalled if I told you what I actually think.”</p><p>Agatha barked out a laugh, the last of the tension loosening in her chest. “Who are you and what have you done with Lilia?”</p><p>“Oh hush,” Lilia replied, already moving on. “Go ask Rio if she wants that carbonara I made her last time.”</p><p>Agatha sighed, recognising a deliberate subject change when she heard one, and accepted that Lilia wasn’t going to elaborate. She headed back into the living room.</p><p>She stopped short.</p><p>Rio was fast asleep on the couch, still sitting upright, head tipped back slightly, mouth parted. A soft, almost inaudible snore escaped her.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened.</p><p>Rio had worked the night before. Had come straight to find her. Had stayed steady and present and uncomplaining, setting her own exhaustion aside without a second thought just to make sure Agatha was okay.</p><p>The sight undid her.</p><p>Agatha moved quietly, pulling a throw from the armchair and draping it gently over Rio’s shoulders. She crouched, brushing her thumb once along Rio’s cheek before pressing a light kiss to her temple.</p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured, too softly to wake her.</p><p>Rio didn’t stir.</p><p>Agatha walked back into the kitchen with a soft smile on her face.</p><p>“She’s out cold,” Agatha said softly, glancing back toward the living room.</p><p>Lilia hummed in quiet acknowledgment, hands moving with practiced ease as she continued preparing food, the rhythm of it as familiar and grounding as ever.</p><p>“And you,” Lilia added without looking up, “will be just as exhausted once all this finally settles.” She finally turned, fixing Agatha with a gentle but unmistakably firm look. “Go put on something comfortable. After you eat, you’re getting some rest.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to argue, then thought better of it.</p><p>She nodded instead and made her way upstairs, moving on autopilot. She peeled off her damp clothes, dropping them in an untidy heap, and stepped into the shower. Warm water spilled over her shoulders, steam blooming around her, loosening muscles she hadn’t realised she’d been holding tight all day.<br/>She tilted her head forward, letting the water run down her back, and only then did she look down at herself.</p><p>Her gaze caught on the scar just above her knee.</p><p>It was thin and pale now, a white line against her skin, easy to miss if you weren’t looking for it. But Agatha had always known exactly where it was. Her fingers drifted there without conscious thought, tracing the familiar shape.</p><p>She remembered the moment it happened with uncomfortable clarity.</p><p>She’d been ten. Walking home from school, backpack heavy, shoes scuffing the pavement, when one of the neighbour’s dogs had gotten loose. It had chased her down the street, barking and snarling, and she’d run harder than she ever had before. She’d almost made it home.</p><p>Almost.</p><p>She’d tripped just short of the front gate, her knee slamming into the concrete, fabric tearing, skin splitting open. She remembered the shock more than the pain at first — the wet warmth spreading down her leg as blood soaked through her trousers.</p><p>She remembered limping inside.</p><p>And she remembered Evanora’s scream.</p><p>Not fear. Not concern. Rage.</p><p>Agatha could still hear it, sharp and shrill, cutting straight through her. <em>What have you done now</em>? Evanora had shouted, furious about the mess, about the interruption, about the inconvenience. She hadn’t looked at the wound once.</p><p>“Clean yourself up,” she’d snapped.</p><p>So Agatha had. Alone. Sitting on the bathroom floor, hands shaking as she tore at cheap toilet paper, wincing as she pressed it to the cut. She remembered watching the paper dissolve too quickly, streaked red, and the panic that followed- not about the injury, but about using too much paper.</p><p>What if Evanora noticed?<br/> What if she got angry again?</p><p>The water from the shower blurred her vision as the memory pressed in, her throat tightening.<br/>Looking at the scar now, decades later, Agatha traced the line once more. It wasn’t just a mark on her body. It was proof. Another small reminder of a childhood lived in the dark, where pain was an inconvenience and comfort didn’t exist.</p><p>She let her hand fall away and straightened slowly, forcing herself to breathe.</p><p>Unbidden, another image rose up — Lilia kneeling in front of her years later, gently cleaning a scraped knuckle, pressing a bandage into place, kissing it like it mattered. Like <em>she</em> mattered. Lilia had done it again and again over the years, tending not just to cuts and bruises, but to all the quiet injuries Agatha never learned how to name.</p><p>She smiled faintly to herself.</p><p>Lilia was still doing it.</p><p>Not with bandages now but with food, with shelter, with fierce protection and steady love. With insisting she rest. With standing guard when the past tried to reach for her again.</p><p>Agatha’s thoughts drifted then, as they so often did, to Nicky.</p><p>To the way she had flinched, for years, from the idea of adoption and how quickly she’d shut it down whenever it crept too close. She’d told herself it was practical, responsible, that her life was too demanding. But beneath that, there had always been the deeper fear: that whatever had shaped Evanora lived somewhere inside her too. That cruelty, neglect, emotional absence might be something inherited rather than learned.</p><p>The idea of passing that on had terrified her.</p><p>She could never imagine making Nicky feel the way she had felt as a child, so small, unwanted, like an inconvenience. She couldn’t imagine looking at someone who depended on her and feeling nothing but irritation or resentment.</p><p>She couldn’t imagine hating someone that much.</p><p>Least of all a child.</p><p>Agatha had loved Nicky. Fiercely. Completely. In ways that had surprised her with their intensity and scared her with their permanence. That love had come so easily it had dismantled every lie she’d told herself about being incapable of it.</p><p>Which was what made the truth hurt the most.</p><p>The knowledge that her own mother had never been capable of loving her — not in any way that mattered — was something Agatha knew would never fully stop aching. It wasn’t a wound that healed. It was one she carried.</p><p>But standing there now, under the steady warmth of the shower, Agatha reminded herself of the truth she was still learning to hold onto.</p><p>She was not unlovable.</p><p>She never had been.</p><p>What mattered, and what she had to keep choosing to focus on, were the people who had loved her. Who continued to love her. Who had seen her at her worst and stayed anyway.</p><p>Lilia, with her quiet constancy and fierce protection.</p><p>Rio, with her warmth, patience, and unwavering presence.</p><p>Agatha shut off the water and reached for a towel, the steam curling around her like a gentle cocoon. As she wrapped it around herself, she felt something settle — not peace, not yet, but something sturdier.</p><p>Hope.</p><p>And this time, she didn’t push it away.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The week before Christmas arrived with unnerving speed.</p><p>As far as Agatha was aware, Evanora was still a patient at the hospital. She didn’t ask for updates. She didn’t check the board. She didn’t look at the census longer than necessary. But she noticed other things — the way Jen’s eye twitched almost imperceptibly after certain consults, the way her jaw tightened when she came back from that end of the floor. Whatever was happening in room ninety-eight, it wasn’t pleasant.</p><p>Jen never commented on it. Not to Agatha, anyway. And Agatha was grateful for that restraint.<br/>
She had made her peace — or something close enough to pass for it. She went about her days with the same efficiency and precision she always had. She rounded. She operated. She taught. She corrected Teen with her usual sharpness. If she occasionally took the longer route to radiology or adjusted her schedule to avoid a certain hallway, that was simply logistics. Nothing more.</p><p>Room ninety-eight did not exist for her.</p><p>Natasha checked in regularly, always under some professional pretext or another — a question about scheduling, a clarification about a case, a casual “while I’ve got you” in passing. Agatha appreciated the concern, even as she bristled against it. She didn’t want to be handled gently. She didn’t want the careful phrasing or the sympathetic looks that crept into conversations when people thought she might break.</p><p>She wasn’t fragile.</p><p>What she wanted was normalcy. Distance. Time.</p><p>The sooner Evanora was discharged, the better.</p><p>And, to her credit, Lilia stayed away from the hospital exactly as promised. No surprise visits. No pointed comments delivered in sharp tones. Agatha suspected it wasn’t from lack of temptation — but from respect.</p><p>Things in life were… good for Agatha.</p><p>The realisation still caught her off guard sometimes, arriving quietly in the middle of ordinary moments — pouring coffee, walking through the hospital corridors, waking up tangled in Rio’s sheets — and leaving her briefly disoriented. Good was not a state she had ever trusted for long. But lately, it seemed to hold.</p><p>And it was almost entirely because of the people around her.</p><p>She’d grown closer to Jen and Alice in a way that felt accidental but inevitable, the kind of intimacy that came from proximity and shared routines rather than grand gestures. Between Agatha staying over at Rio’s most nights and Jen crashing at Alice’s more often than not, they’d fallen into an easy rhythm — late-night takeout, half-watched movies, arguments over music, and the quiet solidarity of people who saw each other at their worst and didn’t flinch.</p><p>It was… strange. Comforting. A little surreal.</p><p>Wanda hovered at the edges of it all, and Agatha knew exactly why. Natasha’s influence was obvious — the subtle check-ins, the casual “how are you holding up” slipped into conversation like it was nothing. </p><p>But Wanda never pushed. She didn’t prod or psychoanalyse. She gave Agatha space, met her sharp banter with dry, perfectly timed comebacks, and stayed when things got quiet instead of filling the silence.<br/>
For the first time in her life, Agatha had friends.</p><p>Real ones. Not colleagues. Not people bound by convenience or obligation. People who chose her.</p><p>And then there was Rio.</p><p>Rio, who slept warm and solid beside her, who made space for her without ever making her feel like a burden. Who noticed without interrogating. Who loved her with an ease that still made Agatha’s chest ache in disbelief.</p><p>Agatha thanked the universe every morning she woke up next to her — not dramatically, not aloud, but with a quiet, reverent gratitude that settled deep in her bones. Other than Lilia, no one had ever made Agatha their first choice. Their priority. Their <em>person.</em></p><p>Rio did it without hesitation.<br/>
Without conditions.<br/>
Without asking Agatha to be anything other than exactly who she was.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness, Debbie Jenkins was admitted again.”</p><p>Teen’s voice cut cleanly through Agatha’s thoughts, sharp enough to pull her fully back into the present. She looked up from the chart she’d been half-staring at, blinking once as her mind recalibrated.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly. “Shit,” she muttered. “Again?”<br/>
 She straightened. “Symptoms?”</p><p>Teen fell into step beside her as they started down the corridor, tablet already in hand. “Severe abdominal pain, intermittent but escalating. Nausea, vomiting. She’s had episodes of dizziness, occasional shortness of breath, tachycardia without a clear trigger. Low-grade fevers that come and go.” He scrolled as he spoke. “Labs are clean. CT, MRI, ultrasound — all unremarkable. Autoimmune panel negative. Infectious disease cleared her. Cardiology cleared her.”</p><p>Agatha frowned. “And yet she looks like hell every time she comes in.”</p><p>“Exactly,” Teen said. “She’s not faking it.”</p><p>“I know,” Agatha replied without hesitation.</p><p>They moved briskly, Agatha’s mind already working through possibilities — rare conditions, atypical presentations, things that slipped through diagnostic cracks because medicine didn’t like uncertainty. </p><p>Patients like Debbie Jenkins haunted her. People who were clearly, undeniably ill but didn’t fit neatly into any algorithm.</p><p>They reached the room and paused briefly outside the door.</p><p>“Let me lead,” Agatha said quietly. “Watch her baseline. Watch what she <em>doesn’t</em> say. She's spreading herself too thin.”</p><p>Teen nodded.</p><p>When they stepped inside, the scene immediately softened something in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Debbie Jenkins lay propped up in the hospital bed, pale to the point of translucence, dark circles etched beneath her eyes. One hand pressed protectively against her abdomen, the other resting on the rail. She looked exhausted — not just tired, but worn thin by pain that never fully relented.</p><p>Perched beside her was a little girl no older than three.</p><p>Her daughter Gabby.</p><p>She sat cross-legged on the bed, clutching a stuffed rabbit that had clearly seen better days, babbling happily to no one in particular as she bounced the toy against the mattress. She looked utterly unconcerned by IV poles and monitors, delighting instead in the echo her voice made in the room.</p><p>Debbie looked up as they entered, immediate embarrassment flashing across her face. “Oh— Dr Harkness, I’m so sorry,” she said quickly. “I know she’s not supposed to be here. Her daycare’s closed because of the snow and I— I didn’t have anyone else.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha said at once, her voice gentle but assured. “You did the right thing coming in.” She glanced at Gabby, then smiled faintly. “Hi there.”</p><p>Gabby stared at her solemnly for half a second before offering, “Teddy,” and holding the toy up like an introduction.</p><p>Agatha nodded gravely. “He is very cute.”</p><p>Teen hid a smile.</p><p>Agatha turned her attention back to Debbie. “We’re going to run a few more tests today,” she said calmly. <br/>
“Some repeat labs, maybe a more targeted imaging study. Depending on how long things take, it might be best to have someone come pick Gabby up so she’s not stuck here all day.”</p><p>Debbie’s expression faltered. She looked down, fingers tightening around the blanket. “I… I don’t really have anyone.”</p><p>Agatha waited.</p><p>“My family doesn’t speak to me anymore,” Debbie continued quietly. “They’re very religious. Having a baby out of wedlock was… unforgivable.” Her mouth tightened. “And her father left when I told him I was pregnant. So it’s just us.”</p><p>The words landed heavier than they should have.</p><p>Agatha felt something sharp twist in her chest — an echo she didn’t invite. Evanora’s rigid rules. </p><p>Conditional love. Punishment disguised as religous morality.</p><p>She softened instantly.</p><p>“That’s not something you need to be embarrassed about,” Agatha said firmly. “You’re doing this alone, and that takes strength.” She glanced at Gabby again, then back to Debbie. “We’ll figure something out, I'll see if the staff daycare has any openings for today.”</p><p>Debbie’s eyes filled just slightly, relief flickering through the pain. “Thank you,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha nodded once, professional but warm. “Let’s focus on you. We’ll take care of the rest.”</p><p>She slipped back into work mode easily, the familiar focus settling over her as she reviewed Debbie’s vitals and lab history. She adjusted the IV rate, tapped notes into the chart, and rattled off additional tests — repeats, targeted panels, a few less obvious studies that required persistence rather than protocol.</p><p>Teen hovered beside her, nodding quickly, fingers poised to input orders.</p><p>“I’ll go put these in,” he said, already turning toward the door.</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, glancing up.</p><p>Teen froze.</p><p>She met his eyes, a deliberate pause stretching just long enough to make him nervous. “I have a special job for you today.”</p><p>His face lit up instantly. “Seriously?” he breathed. “Oh my god, thank you. I won’t let you do—”</p><p>“You,” Agatha cut in smoothly, “will be taking care of our sweet little Gabby while we run tests.”</p><p>The smile fell from his face as if someone had pulled a plug.</p><p>“…I’m sorry?” Teen said faintly.</p><p>Agatha gestured toward the bed, where Gabby was now happily attempting to feed her stuffed teddy a hospital wristband. </p><p>“Hospital day care is full for the next few hours. In the meantime, Gabby cannot go with her mother to imaging.”</p><p>Teen swallowed. Hard. “But I don’t know anything about kids.”</p><p>Agatha arched an eyebrow. “You know how to keep a human alive, don’t you?”</p><p>“That feels like a different category.”</p><p>“Think of it as a peads rotation,” Agatha said pleasantly, a hint of amusement in her eyes.</p><p>Teen stared at Gabby, who looked back at him with complete confidence.</p><p>“This feels like a trap,” he muttered.</p><p>Agatha smiled, entirely innocent.</p><p><br/>
Later, after what felt like hours, Agatha finally stepped out of Debbie’s room.</p><p>Debbie had been put through the wringer — blood draws, imaging, contrast studies, exams that required patience and cooperation she was clearly running out of. By the end of it she looked utterly spent, eyes glassy with exhaustion, voice hoarse from answering the same questions again and again. Agatha had promised her a break, pain management, and answers — even if those answers took time.</p><p>As Agatha turned toward the nurses’ station, already mentally reviewing next steps, something felt… off.</p><p>She scanned the ER floor out of habit.</p><p>Monitors beeped steadily. A trauma bay curtain swayed as someone passed behind it. At one of the beds, Teen stood hunched over a grown man, carefully suturing a small cut on his finger. The man was whimpering theatrically, clutching his hand like he’d narrowly survived an amputation.</p><p>Three stitches. Maybe.</p><p>Agatha did not see Gabby.</p><p>The blood drained from her face so quickly it made her dizzy.</p><p>She forced herself to keep moving, expression smoothing into professional neutrality as she approached. She gave the patient a polite, tight smile. “Almost done,” she said evenly, resisting the urge to roll her eyes at the volume of his complaints.</p><p>Then she turned her attention to Teen.</p><p>“Dr. Caplan,” she said calmly. “A moment, please.”</p><p>Teen flinched.</p><p>He finished the suture with hurried precision, murmured something apologetic to the patient, and straightened. The tension in his shoulders was immediate and unmistakable. He followed Agatha a few steps away before she stopped abruptly and grabbed his elbow, steering him aside with controlled force.</p><p>Her voice dropped.</p><p>“Where the fuck is the kid?”</p><p>Teen swallowed. “I— I’m sorry, Dr. Harkness. The ER got slammed, and I was technically free so I thought—”</p><p>Agatha’s face went pale in a way that had nothing to do with anger and everything to do with fear.</p><p>“William,” she said quietly.</p><p>That made his eyes widen. She almost never used his real name.</p><p>“Where. Is. She?”</p><p>Before he could answer — before he could even stutter an excuse — a small, high-pitched squeal echoed through the ER.</p><p>Agatha whipped around.</p><p>And stopped dead.</p><p>Rio was walking toward them from the far end of the department, still in her WVFD hoodie, hair a little mussed, face bright with laughter. Perched confidently on her shoulders was three-year-old Gabby, gripping a pink <em>Get Well Soon! </em>balloon with both hands like it was the most important thing in the world.</p><p>Gabby squealed again, delighted by her height, one small mittened hand tangled in Rio’s hair.</p><p>Rio looked up — and caught Agatha staring.</p><p>She grinned.</p><p>Agatha’s heart did something strange and unrecognisable in her chest. It flipped, stuttered, and then expanded so suddenly she had to inhale sharply to steady herself.</p><p>Or maybe that was something else entirely.</p><p>She took in the sight in front of her — Rio steady and sure, hands instinctively braced at Gabby’s ankles, murmuring something that made the little girl giggle again — and felt something warm and dangerous bloom low in her abdomen.</p><p>Love. Awe. Biology. Heat. She wasn’t sure which.</p><p>“Teen,” Agatha said faintly, eyes still locked on Rio, “you’re on paeds again tomorrow.”</p><p>Teen didn’t even argue.</p><p>Rio finally reached them, lowering Gabby carefully to the floor. “Hey,” she said softly, eyes never leaving Agatha’s face. “Billy said he needed a hand. Figured I’d help.”</p><p>Gabby waved her balloon proudly. “Up!”</p><p>Agatha blinked, swallowed, and forced herself to breathe.</p><p>She had saved lives before.</p><p>But nothing — <em>nothing</em> — had prepared her for this.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” was all Agatha managed, the words coming out far less composed than she would have liked.</p><p>Her brain lagged behind the moment, still scrambling to make sense of it, while her heart fluttered wildly in her chest. Heat pooled low in her abdomen in a way that made her briefly curse her own body, and she was acutely aware of how difficult it was not to reach out and grab Rio by the front of her hoodie — decorum, professionalism, and the presence of a three-year-old being the only things restraining her.</p><p>“I was just dropping off some gifts to the burn unit,” Rio said easily. “The fire station does it every year.”</p><p>Of course they did. Of course<em> she</em> did.</p><p>Agatha smiled, something soft and a little stunned tugging at her mouth. “A real-life Santa, huh?”</p><p>Rio’s grin widened, unassuming and warm.</p><p>Agatha looked at Rio and felt the familiar swell of disbelief and gratitude rise in her chest. She couldn’t quite believe how lucky she was.</p><p>Rio was, without question, the kindest person she had ever known.</p><p>Rio laughed, lifting a hand to scratch thoughtfully at her chin. “Is that a subtle way of telling me I have chin hairs?”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth to reply, already armed with something dry and devastating — but she never got the chance.</p><p>“Santa?!” Gabby suddenly squealed, the word detonating with pure delight. She bounced on her feet, eyes wide, spinning in a tiny circle as if Santa himself might materialise behind a curtain. “Mommy with Santa?” she asked earnestly, craning her neck to look around.</p><p>Rio and Agatha both burst out laughing.</p><p>Agatha dropped into a crouch in front of her, her expression softening instinctively. “Mommy’s very tired right now,” she said gently, “so she’s getting some rest. But”—she lowered her voice conspiratorially—“I <em>did</em> tell Santa that you’ve been a very good girl while Mommy’s been resting.”</p><p>She winked.</p><p>Gabby’s face lit up like she’d just been handed the secret of the universe.</p><p>Agatha straightened, glancing between Rio and the balloon bobbing happily in Gabby’s grip. “I’m sorry,” she added, a hint of guilt creeping in. “I thought someone from daycare would have come by to pick her up by now.”</p><p>“It’s okay,” Rio said easily, waving it off. “Don’t worry about it.” She looked down at Gabby with a grin. “We were just about to go get something to eat anyway, right?”</p><p>Gabby nodded enthusiastically, already scanning the hallway for whatever adventure came next.</p><p>Rio looked back at Agatha, eyes warm and inviting. “Wanna join us? I hear the cafeteria’s doing macaroni today.”</p><p>She said it like it was the most enticing offer in the world.</p><p>Agatha huffed a laugh, shaking her head. God help her — if Rio was there, she’d probably eat anything.</p><p><br/>
They ended up in the cafeteria, tucked into a corner table away from most of the noise. Agatha found herself watching more than eating as Rio helped Gabby navigate a bowl of macaroni, blowing gently on each forkful before offering it up, praising her like it was the most important job in the world.</p><p>It was effortless. Natural.</p><p>“You’re really good with her,” Agatha said quietly.</p><p>Rio glanced up, a faint blush creeping into her cheeks. “She’s easy,” she said with a soft laugh. “You should meet Steve and Peggy’s kids sometime. Absolute chaos. Feral, the lot of them.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, but her gaze lingered on Rio — on the way she leaned in close, patient and warm, on how Gabby clearly trusted her without question.</p><p>Her thoughts drifted, uninvited and heavy.</p><p>She wondered, not for the first time, what Rio would have been like with Nicky. What that might have looked like — mornings, bedtime stories, scraped knees soothed by steady hands. She wondered who she herself might have been if things had gone differently. If Nicky had lived. If she’d followed through with adoption.</p><p>And then the thought twisted further.</p><p>If he had survived… would she have ever left Boston? Would she have rebuilt herself here? Would she have met Rio at all?</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>Rio’s voice cut gently through the spiral.</p><p>Agatha blinked, realising she’d gone still, fork hovering uselessly in her hand. She shook her head slightly, grounding herself. “Yeah. Sorry. Just… thinking.”</p><p>Rio studied her for a moment longer, concern flickering across her face — then softening. She always knew. It was uncanny sometimes, the way she seemed to read Agatha without needing words.</p><p>She didn’t push. Didn’t demand explanations.</p><p>She just reached out, brushing her fingers briefly against Agatha’s hand — a silent reminder that she was here, that this moment was real, and that Agatha didn’t have to carry every thought alone.</p><p>Just as they were finishing up, a daycare worker Agatha had spoken to earlier approached their table, a little out of breath, apologetic already written across her face.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness, I’m so sorry for the delay,” she said. “I tried to free up space sooner, but one of the nurses was stuck in surgery and couldn’t pick up their little one until later. I can take Gabby down now, if you still need me to?”</p><p>She softened the last part, crouching slightly, her tone bright and inviting as she directed it toward Gabby.</p><p>Agatha nodded. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught the brief flicker on Rio’s face — disappointment, gone almost as quickly as it appeared — before Rio schooled her expression into something warm and encouraging when Gabby turned to her, clearly seeking approval.</p><p>“That sounds fun, right, Gabs?” Rio said easily, pitching her voice light, reassuring. “You’ll get to hang out with some friends.”</p><p>That was all it took. Gabby beamed, hopped down from the chair, and slipped her small hand into the daycare worker’s without hesitation.</p><p>Rio watched them go with a soft, lingering smile.</p><p>Agatha watched Rio.</p><p>There was something achingly tender about her like this — hands tucked into the pocket of her hoodie, shoulders relaxed, eyes following Gabby until she disappeared around the corner. It wasn’t performative. It wasn’t effortful. It was instinctive, quiet, and deeply grounding.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened.</p><p>God, she loved her. Fiercely. In a way that startled her anew every day. Everything about Rio, her steadiness, her warmth, the way she showed up without ever being asked made Agatha fall harder, deeper, more irrevocably.</p><p>And then the thought hit her.</p><p>Not gentle. Not abstract.</p><p>A sharp, visceral flash of complete want.</p><p>The sudden, overwhelming image of herself pregnant, of Rio putting <em>a baby into her</em>, fucking her so hard that they miraculously conceived a baby of their own. With tanned skin, brown eyes and Agatha’s mane of curly hair. </p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>Her body reacted before her mind could catch up.</p><p>She choked on the last bite of macaroni she hadn’t realised she was still chewing.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>Rio spun instantly, concern snapping into place. “You okay, mi amor?”</p><p>Agatha grabbed her water, downing it far too quickly, eyes wide, pulse racing. She cleared her throat, face flushed hot with shock and something dangerously close to desire.</p><p>“Yep,” she said too fast. “Yeah. Totally fine. Just—wrong pipe.”</p><p>Rio eyed her, suspicious but smiling. “You sure?”</p><p>Agatha nodded emphatically. “Absolutely. Never better.”</p><p>Rio laughed, shaking her head, and turned back toward the exit.</p><p>Agatha sat there for a beat longer, staring down at her tray, heart still pounding.</p><p><em>Where the fuck did that come from?</em></p><p>She didn’t have an answer.</p><p>“I should probably head back,” Rio said casually, already leaning in to press a soft, familiar kiss to Agatha’s lips. “You coming over later?”</p><p>“Um— yeah,” Agatha replied, blinking once as her brain caught up. “I’ve got a couple of things to finish up first.”</p><p>“Alright,” Rio said easily. “I’ll see you back home then.”</p><p>She leaned in again, stealing another gentle kiss before stepping away.</p><p>It struck Agatha, not for the first time, how little she reacted to it now. The same woman who used to bristle at even the suggestion of public affection — especially at work, of all places — hadn’t hesitated for a second. Rio had done that to her. Somewhere along the way, the instinct to flinch had disappeared. </p><p>Agatha no longer cared who saw when Rio showed her love, or when Agatha accepted it openly.</p><p>She watched Rio walk away down the corridor, waving at familiar faces, completely at ease.</p><p>And then the thought she’d been avoiding crept back in.</p><p>Agatha’s brow furrowed as she replayed the sudden urge to have Rio impregnate her. The thought once again making her thighs clench and heat creep up her neck. The image hadn’t been romantic or abstract. It had been animalistic and <em>hot</em>.</p><p>Did she… have some kind of <em>breeding kink</em>?</p><p>The thought landed with equal parts disbelief and alarm.</p><p>Agatha had never thought about pregnancy in her life. Not seriously. Her career had been too consuming, too central, for the idea to ever gain traction. Children had existed only at the periphery of her world. They were patients, not possibilities.</p><p>But seeing Rio with Gabby had cracked something open. Something instinctive. Something deep and undeniably real.</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly, rubbing a hand over her face.</p><p><em>Jesus</em>, she thought. <em>What the fuck is wrong with me?</em></p><p>Whatever it was, she knew one thing for certain.</p><p>She didn’t hate it.</p><p> </p><p><br/>
When Agatha eventually walked into Rio’s apartment after her shift, she stopped just inside the door.</p><p>The lights were low, warm rather than dim, and the slow, unmistakable hum of <em><strong>Sade’s By Your Side</strong></em> drifted through the space, wrapping the room in something intimate and unhurried.</p><p>Rio was in the kitchen, fresh from the shower, hair twisted into a messy knot that left her neck bare and still damp. She wore a loose tank top and boxers, the fabric clinging in places it had no right to. The hem of the tank rode up as she worked the cork free from a bottle of red wine, exposing toned stomach and the sharp, elegant cut of her hip bones. Her arms were faintly flushed from the heat of the water, muscles relaxed but powerful, familiar and devastating all at once.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>For a split second, she wasn’t <em>here.</em></p><p>She was back in the cafeteria, watching Rio with Gabby — watching the ease with which Rio stepped into care and patience and quiet joy, like it had always belonged to her. And then the thought surged up again, uninvited and overwhelming.</p><p><em>Rio giving her a family.</em></p><p>Not just loving her. Not just staying. But something deeper, more physical and irrevocable — Rio knocking her up, binding their lives together in a way that couldn’t be undone, a future written into Agatha’s body as surely as into her heart.</p><p>The intensity of it made her dizzy.</p><p>Agatha swallowed, pulse roaring in her ears. She had no idea where the thought had come from, only that it landed heavy and undeniable, settling low in her abdomen with startling clarity.</p><p>The cork came free with a soft pop.</p><p>Rio glanced up, catching Agatha frozen in the doorway, and smiled — warm, open, entirely hers.<br/>
“Hey,” she said, setting the bottle down. “You’re home.”</p><p>That was it.</p><p>Agatha crossed the space between them in three long strides and kissed her.</p><p>Hard.</p><p>Rio startled, a surprised sound leaving her before setting the wine down blindly, her arms came up instinctively, wrapping around Agatha’s waist and pulling her closer. The kiss was urgent, pent-up, fuelled by everything Agatha hadn’t said and hadn’t yet learned how to name. Her hands slid to Rio’s sides, grounding herself in the solid reality of her.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio murmured when she finally pulled back just enough to breathe, smiling softly, thumb brushing Agatha’s jaw. “Long day?”</p><p>Agatha huffed out a breath, forehead resting briefly against Rio’s. “You have no idea.”</p><p>Rio kissed her again — slower this time, deeper — Sade crooning softly behind them, wine forgotten on the counter.</p><p>And with unnerving certainty, Agatha knew the thought from earlier hadn’t been a fluke.</p><p>It was her heart catching up to something her body had already decided.</p><p>“Wine?” Rio managed, pulling back slightly, her fingers already working at the buttons on Agatha’s shirt. “Food?”</p><p>“Later,” Agatha told her.</p><p>Rio’s eyes were warm as they ran over Agatha’s face, checking for signs of any stress or unease. She nodded, kissing Agatha again as she finished unbuttoning her shirt. Agatha shrugged out of it, letting it fall to the floor. Then her hands were slipping into Rio’s boxers, palming her ass, squeezing with one hand and bringing her other hand round to spread her fingers through coarse hair.</p><p>Rio groaned against Agatha’s mouth, her hips pressing forward. She was already wet, arching into Agatha’s touch, and the knowledge of that — of how much Rio wanted her — went straight to Agatha’s core. She could feel herself getting wet already, could feel the ache building between her thighs.</p><p>“Bedroom?” Rio murmured, her mouth hot against Agatha’s jaw.</p><p>Agatha just shook her head, kissing Rio again, tugging at her boxers. “Here,” she said against Rio’s mouth.</p><p>Rio made a low noise, breaking the kiss to strip off Agatha’s pants and underwear. Her eyes were dark, her cheeks flushed. “Here?” she asked again, but she was already tugging Agatha’s pants down her hips, her eyes running over Agatha’s body appreciatively. “Fuck, Agatha. You’re insatiable.”</p><p>Agatha shivered at the look in Rio’s eyes, at the feel of Rio’s hands on her skin. She kissed her again, letting Rio walk her back until her hips hit the kitchen counter. Rio broke the kiss, reaching out to brush her thumb over Agatha’s lower lip. “Someone’s a little worked up” she smiled.</p><p>Agatha kissed her thumb, then took it into her mouth, sucking gently. Rio groaned, her eyes fixed on Agatha’s mouth. She was breathing heavily, her other hand gripping Agatha’s hip tightly.</p><p>“Did you miss me that much, mi amor?” Rio asked, her thumb tracing Agatha’s bottom lip. Her eyes were dark and warm on Agatha’s, and Agatha couldn’t look away.</p><p>Agatha didn’t trust herself to speak, so she just nodded, reaching out to run her fingertips up Rio’s side, watching the way Rio’s muscles twitched at the touch.</p><p>Rio’s hand was warm on Agatha’s thigh, her touch gentle. “I thought about you all day, seeing you in that white coat…” she said softly. “Yelling at people, so much fucking power... it must be tiring. Do you want me to take control mi Corazon?”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. She’d never been asked that before — never been cared for like that before.</p><p>She nodded, her eyes on Rio’s as Rio’s fingers brushed against the gusset of her underwear. She could feel how wet she was already, how ready, and she knew Rio could feel it too. Rio’s eyes were darker, her expression soft and intent.</p><p>She pressed a kiss to the corner of Agatha’s mouth and then, slowly, slid her hand into Agatha’s underwear. Agatha’s breath caught at the feel of Rio’s long fingers sliding through her slick folds.</p><p>Rio’s breath was warm against Agatha’s cheek as she kissed her way down the line of Agatha’s jaw. “So wet,” she murmured. “Is this all for me?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, her heart beating wildly, her breath coming short and sharp. She could feel her whole body throbbing with want, with need. “Rio,” she breathed, pressing closer, trying to get friction, trying to get Rio’s fingers where she needed them.</p><p>Rio bit gently at Agatha’s earlobe, her fingers still sliding through Agatha’s slick folds. “Tell me, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha let out a low, desperate sound, her hips rolling against Rio’s hand. “Yes,” she managed. “It’s for you.”</p><p>Rio made a low noise and then, finally, slid two fingers inside her. Agatha moaned at the feeling, at the relief of finally being filled. She was so wet that Rio slid inside easily, the drag of her fingers sending sparks of pleasure up Agatha’s spine.</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha breathed, her hands gripping Rio’s shoulders, her hips rocking down into the sensation. “Fuck.”</p><p>“Is this what you wanted?” Rio asked, pressing a kiss to Agatha’s chest. Her fingers were motionless inside Agatha, her thumb pressed against Agatha’s clit.</p><p>Agatha whined at the sensation, rolling her hips against Rio’s hand, trying to get her to move. “Yes,” she said, her voice low and rough. “Yes. Don’t stop.”</p><p>Rio nodded, pulling her fingers almost all the way out before pushing them back in slowly. She was staring at Agatha like she wanted to memorise her, like she wanted to remember every expression that crossed Agatha’s face as she fucked her.</p><p>Agatha kept her eyes open, watching Rio, pleasure building low in her belly at the tenderness in Rio’s expression, at the heat in her eyes. “More,” she said, rolling her hips to meet Rio’s thrusts. “Harder.”</p><p>Rio made a low, needy noise, picking up the pace, her hand rocking Agatha roughly. Agatha tightened her grip on Rio’s shoulders, holding on, her breath catching every time Rio’s fingers pushed inside her. She could feel pleasure building, could feel that delicious edge approaching.</p><p>She pressed closer to Rio, her mouth finding Rio’s, kissing her deeply. Rio groaned against her mouth and broke the kiss to trail her mouth down Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Agatha tipped her head back, moaning as Rio sucked a bruise into the skin just above her collarbone. She rolled her hips down against Rio’s hand, fucking herself on Rio’s fingers, the tension in her core winding tighter with every thrust.</p><p><em>Fuck a baby into me.</em><br/>
<em>Fuck a baby into me.</em><br/>
<em>Fuck a baby into me.</em></p><p>The thoughts in Agathas mind repeated with each rhythmic thrust. She bit her lip almost hard enough to draw blood to prevent herself from screaming the words aloud.</p><p>Rio was watching her with dark, heated eyes. “Fuck,” she murmured, pressing a kiss to the base of Agatha’s throat. “Such a good girl for me.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered at the praise, at the way Rio was looking at her, her hips moving faster, pleasure rising inside her. Rio’s thumb found her clit, stroking gently, and that was enough to tip Agatha over the edge, to send her tumbling over into pleasure. She let out a rough cry, her hips jerking against Rio’s hand as she rode out her orgasm.</p><p>Rio kept her fingers moving through the waves of Agatha’s pleasure, pressing soft kisses to her jaw, her throat, the curve of her shoulder. </p><p>Agatha’s breathing eased as her grip loosened, the crescent moon marks visible on Rio’s shoulders.</p><p> Rio wrapped her in a hug, pressing a kiss to her forehead, but Agatha pushed her back, turning them so that Rio was the one pressed against the counter. She dropped to her knees, pulling Rio’s boxers down with her.</p><p>Rio let out a surprised sound, her hands coming up to tangle in Agatha’s hair as Agatha trailed soft kisses up the inside of her thigh. She could see the muscles in Rio’s stomach twitching, could see the way Rio’s breath caught as Agatha got closer to where she wanted to be.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathed, her fingers tightening in Agatha’s hair. “You don’t have to—”</p><p>Agatha looked up at her, pressing a kiss just above Rio’s centre. “I want to,” she said, watching the way Rio’s throat moved as she swallowed.</p><p>Rio nodded, her expression shifting into something softer, something almost reverent. Agatha had to look away for a moment, had to press a kiss to Rio’s thigh as she tried to steady herself. Rio made her feel off balance in ways she hadn’t experienced in a long time. Ways she wasn’t sure how to handle.</p><p>She took a breath and then turned her head, licking a long stripe up Rio’s centre. Rio’s whole body jerked, her hips canting forward, a low groan slipping out of her. Agatha could feel the way her body was already responding to the taste of Rio on her tongue. She licked again, slower this time, paying close attention to the way Rio’s breathing hitched, the way her hips shifted.</p><p>Then she was sucking Rio’s clit gently, using her fingers to open her up more, to make it easier to reach every part of her she wanted to taste. Rio let out a low whine, her hips working, trying to get closer to Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>Agatha slid two fingers of her free hand inside her, groaning at the feeling. She kept them still as she licked and sucked at Rio’s clit, as she lost herself in the taste and smell of her.</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha,” Rio breathed. She was watching Agatha with dark eyes, her fingers tight in Agatha’s hair, her hips rolling. “That feels so good.”</p><p>Agatha groaned at the praise, picking up the pace. She curled her fingers inside Rio, searching for that spot she knew would feel good. She found it after a moment, pressing her fingers more firmly against it as she sucked at Rio’s clit.</p><p>“Shit,” Rio gasped, her hips moving faster. “Agatha, I’m close.”</p><p>Agatha made a low noise of encouragement, pressing her fingers more tightly against the spot she’d found. Rio cried out, her whole body shaking with the force of her orgasm. Agatha gentled her movements, letting Rio ride out her pleasure, her tongue soft against Rio’s overstimulated clit.</p><p>After a moment, Rio’s hand slid gently into Agatha’s hair, a quiet question rather than a demand. Agatha pulled back reluctantly, lips tingling, watching as Rio’s breathing slowly steadied, her eyes still dark and warm.</p><p>Rio smiled at her, something affectionate and fond in it, and helped her fully upright. She leaned in to kiss Agatha again — slower this time, unhurried, the kind of kiss meant to linger rather than consume.</p><p>“Bedroom?” Rio asked when she pulled away, her voice low and easy, eyes searching Agatha’s face.</p><p>Agatha smiled, the tension easing out of her shoulders as she pressed close again, brushing one last gentle kiss against Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“Yes,” she murmured softly. “Bedroom.”</p><p>Hand in hand, they turned away from the kitchen, grabbed the wine and giggled as they stumbled into the bedroom, the music still playing quietly behind them.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The snowfall over the past few days had been heavy and unyielding, blanketing roads faster than the town could keep up. Plows struggled to keep secondary streets clear, black ice forming in deceptive patches overnight. Rio had barely seen a structure fire lately- instead, her shifts were filled with car stalls and spin-outs, drivers stranded on shoulders with frozen engines and white-knuckled fear. Tow trucks were backed up for hours. Everyone was tired and cold.</p><p>Inside the ER, it showed.</p><p>Slips and falls filled the board. Wrist fractures, concussions, torn ligaments from missed steps on icy sidewalks. Elderly patients brought in bundled in coats still dusted with snow, apologising for taking up space. It was the kind of winter that wore people down quietly, piling small emergencies on top of one another until everything felt precarious.</p><p>By the time Christmas Eve arrived, the snow had blocked most main roads and most people were confined to their homes. Unless of course, you worked for emergency services. </p><p>Agatha had told Rio and Lilia days earlier that she had volunteered for the double shift, carrying her through the night and into Christmas evening. Rio was also scheduled to work, neither of them particularly surprised by it, and both quietly relieved to have purpose threaded through a day that still carried complicated edges.</p><p>Lilia had insisted on one thing.</p><p>Dinner. The day after Christmas. No arguments.</p><p>She framed it as a new tradition, as something special to mark the day, her eyes bright with meaning. Agatha, to her own surprise, had not bristled. The resentment that once clung to the season had loosened its grip, softened by love, and the thought of sitting down at Lilia’s table no longer filled her with dread.</p><p>It filled her with something close to gratitude.</p><p>When Agatha clocked in that morning, she did not head for the board or the nurses’ station first.</p><p>She went straight to Debbie.</p><p>Debbie had been admitted over a week ago now, and the decline had been gradual but unmistakable. Each day seemed to take a little more from her. By Christmas Eve, she struggled to sit upright without assistance, her limbs heavy and uncooperative. Even lifting her arms long enough to wrap them around Gabby often left her breathless.</p><p>Gabby had began to notice.</p><p>She hovered closer now, quieter, her small hands clutching at her mother’s sleeve as if afraid that letting go might make something worse. Debbie tried to smile for her, tried to be strong, but the effort showed in the tremor of her hands and the way exhaustion settled into her bones.</p><p>By the third day after her being admitted, social services had begun to circle.</p><p>Agatha intercepted them personally.</p><p>The suggestion of a temporary foster placement was framed as protocol, as procedure. Reasonable, even. Agatha heard the words and felt something cold and familiar settle in her chest. She remembered Nicky. Remembered the reports, the visits, the quiet devastation of watching a child passed from place to place under the guise of care.</p><p>She would not allow it to happen again.</p><p>Debbie, pale and shaking, spent what little strength she had left begging Agatha to keep her baby safe. The desperation in her voice was raw and unmistakable.</p><p>Agatha listened.</p><p>Then she acted.</p><p>Under strict conditions, all carefully documented and defensible, Gabby was placed in the hospital’s day care between the hours of nine in the morning and six in the evening, with scheduled visits to Debbie woven throughout the day. There would be no sudden removals. No unnecessary separations. The foster parent who would take her in the evenings was interviewed by Agatha herself before approval was given, every detail scrutinised.</p><p>The justification was clinical.</p><p>Any additional stress, Agatha argued, posed a significant risk to Debbie’s already fragile health.</p><p>It was irrefutable.</p><p>Debbie looked at her like she had hung the moon.</p><p>Like she was something close to an angel.</p><p>Agatha, standing at the foot of the bed, felt the familiar ache of grief and resolve twist together in her chest. She was not doing this to be kind.</p><p>She was doing it because she saw a mother who wanted to fight for her daughter.</p><p>Rio had become a familiar presence in the hospital in a way no one had quite anticipated.</p><p>On days when her lunch break stretched long enough, or when she had time to spare before a night shift, she would skid through the snow in her truck and slip through the side entrance headed straight for the daycare. She never made a fuss about it. No grand announcements. Just a quiet check-in at the desk and a grin that had the staff waving her through without question.</p><p>Gabby spotted her every time.</p><p>“Riiiii-oooo!” she would squeal, abandoning whatever puzzle or crayon she’d been given, barreling toward her with uncoordinated enthusiasm.</p><p>Rio always met her at eye level, dropping into a crouch with her arms wide open. “There she is,” she’d laugh, catching Gabby mid-run and scooping her up just long enough to spin her once before setting her back down. “What’s up, tiny human?”</p><p>High fives and fist bumps were mandatory each time. On particularly energetic days, Gabby insisted on jumping into Rio’s arms so she could be lifted up high, giggling uncontrollably while Rio exaggerated the effort, grunting theatrically.</p><p>“Whoa, you’re getting heavier,” Rio would say, earning an small gasp.</p><p>“I am not!” Gabby protested.</p><p>“Oh yeah?” Rio would grin. “Then how come my arms are <em>this</em> tired?”</p><p>The daycare staff watched fondly from the sidelines as Rio sprawled on the floor with Gabby, building block towers only to knock them down with dramatic sound effects, or sitting cross-legged while Gabby carefully applied stickers to Rio’s sleeves like medals of honour.</p><p>Before night shifts when Gabby had to go back to her foster placement, Rio would keep things quieter.</p><p>She’d sit with Gabby in a small reading nook, Gabby tucked against her side as Rio read picture books in exaggerated voices, making up sound effects that earned snorts of laughter. When Gabby’s attention drifted toward the hallway that led back to her mother’s room, Rio would gently redirect it.</p><p>“Hey,” she’d say softly, tapping the page. “What do you think happens next?”</p><p>It wasn’t about replacing anything. Rio knew that.</p><p>It was about distraction. About giving a three-year-old permission to laugh in a place that often swallowed joy whole. About making the hours feel lighter, even if just for a little while.</p><p>And every time Agatha passed the daycare and caught sight of Rio sitting on the floor, hair mussed, jacket discarded, Gabby perched proudly beside her, something warm and unsteady bloomed in her chest.</p><p>It wasn’t just that Rio was good with children.<br/>It was that she showed up.<br/>Every time.</p><p>As Agatha rounded the corner after checking in on Debbie, she slowed instinctively.</p><p>The tone of the voices ahead of her made something in her chest tighten. They were low, controlled, pitched deliberately so they wouldn’t carry. The kind of voices people used when they didn’t want to be overheard.</p><p>Natasha and Jen stood just outside the corridor that led to room ninety-eight.</p><p>Agatha stopped short, heart sinking.</p><p>“She’s demanding discharge,” Jen was saying quietly, irritation threaded with unease. “Tonight. Says we’re holding her against her will.” Jen scrubbed a hand over her face. “I’ve paged psych, but Chief… I have a horrible feeling, what do we do if they discharge her? Medically she’s stable enough, and mentally—” She shook her head. “She’s delusional but she’s very good at manipulating. And I don’t know what she’ll do in this state.”</p><p>Natasha’s expression was grave, jaw set in a way Agatha had learned meant she was already thinking several steps ahead. “I agree,” she said. “As soon as psych makes their evaluation, loop me in. If she discharges, I want it documented immediately.”</p><p>Jen swallowed. “And then?”</p><p>“Then I’ll alert the police,” Natasha said without hesitation. “Nothing dramatic. Just eyes open. Welfare checks if needed.” Her gaze flicked briefly down the corridor, toward the room they were both carefully avoiding naming. “We don’t take chances with someone like her. Get me her last known address.”</p><p>Agatha stood frozen just out of sight, every word landing like a weight in her stomach.</p><p>Discharge.</p><p>Tonight.</p><p><em>I don’t know what she’ll do in this state</em></p><p>Her fingers curled slowly at her sides, nails biting into her palms as she tried to steady her breathing. Evanora loose in the world again, unconfined, unmonitored, felt like the ground shifting beneath her feet.</p><p>She took a quiet step back before either of them could notice her, retreating the way she’d learned to as a child.</p><p>Silent. Careful.</p><p>Already bracing for possibility of Evanora no longer contained to room ninety-eight. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>Psych arrived with paperwork and calm voices, the kind designed to soothe without pronising anything.</p><p>The attending psychiatrist walked beside Natasha, tablet tucked against her chest, while Jen followed a half-step behind, jaw tight. An orderly waited with them as they made their way down the corridor toward room ninety-eight.</p><p>“After reviewing the case notes we’re recommending transfer,” the psychiatrist said quietly as they walked. “Inpatient psychiatric facility. Secure transport.”</p><p>Natasha nodded once, visibly relieved. “Approved.”</p><p>Jen let out a slow breath. “She’s been escalating. She’s been making comments, like she’s in another time one minute then here the next.”</p><p>“That seems consistent with your assessment,” the psychiatrist replied. “She’s lucid enough to argue, but not enough to self-regulate. There’s fixation, emotional regression, and increasing hostility when she feels challenged.”</p><p>“And the cognitive decline?” Natasha asked.</p><p>“Most likely early Alzheimer’s,” the psychiatrist confirmed. “Memory fragmentation. Confabulation. But I still want to see her to confirm your casenotes Dr Kale. If she is as threatening as you stated in fluctuation, I will need to implement certain security measures. Someone like this can be very deceiving when they’re lucid. ”</p><p>Jen swallowed. “Which makes her unpredictable.”</p><p>“Yes,” the psychiatrist said simply. “And dangerous.”</p><p>They reached the door.</p><p>The orderly stepped forward and pushed it open.</p><p>The room was empty.</p><p>The bed was stripped down to a flat sheet. The IV pole stood abandoned, tubing coiled loosely where it had been disconnected. The heart monitor was dark. Evanora’s coat was gone.</p><p>For a moment, no one spoke.</p><p>Jen was the first to move, stepping fully inside and scanning the room like she expected Evanora to be hiding behind the curtain. “What the fuck?” she muttered.</p><p>Natasha’s expression hardened instantly. “When was she last seen?”</p><p>The orderly checked the hallway, then his pager. “She was documented in bed less than twenty minutes ago.”</p><p>The psychiatrist’s face drained of colour. “She shouldn’t have been left alone.”</p><p>Jen’s stomach dropped. “I gave her a sedative.”</p><p>Natasha was already pulling out her phone. “Lock down the unit. Security now.”</p><p>“She could be anywhere,” the psychiatrist said, voice tight.</p><p>Natasha looked back at the empty bed, the abandoned IV line swaying slightly in the disturbed air.</p><p>“I dont think she planned to leave the hospital,” Natasha said quietly.</p><p>Jen’s blood went cold, her gaze snapping to Natasha. “Agatha.”</p><p>The psychiatrist swallowed. “We have to find her.”</p><p>Silence slammed down between them.</p><p>Natasha didn’t hesitate. “Hospital-wide alert. Missing patient. I want eyes on every exit, every stairwell, every unit.”</p><p>Jen felt her pulse thunder in her ears. “God.”</p><p>Evanora Harkness was no longer contained to room ninety-eight.</p><p> </p><p><br/>Agatha was adjusting Debbie’s IV when the daycare worker knocked softly and stepped inside.</p><p>“Hi Debbie,” she said gently. “I’m here to take Gabby back downstairs.”</p><p>Debbie frowned, confusion flickering across her tired face. “Oh… she already went.”</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>“Went?” she repeated carefully. “Went where?”</p><p>Debbie shifted against the pillows, clearly uneasy now that she was saying it out loud. “A woman from the hospital came to get her. She said there’d been a delay and that Gabby should’ve been downstairs already.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tightened around the bedrail. “What woman?”</p><p>“Older,” Debbie said slowly. “Grey hair. Very stiff. She had a badge clipped to her coat.” Debbie hesitated, then added, “She didn’t seem happy about being here.”</p><p>The daycare worker exchanged a look with Agatha. “Did she say anything else?”</p><p>Debbie swallowed. “She said, ‘Children make everybody late.’” Debbie’s brow furrowed. “She said it like it was… a rule. Like she was annoyed it needed explaining.”</p><p>The room went still.</p><p>Agatha felt the words hit her square in the chest.</p><p><em>Children make everybody late</em>.</p><p>Evanora’s voice echoed in her head with horrifying clarity, precise and cutting, the kind of sentence delivered as judgment rather than observation.</p><p>She could see it. Evanora standing by the door when Agatha was small, coat already on, keys in hand, eyes sharp with irritation.</p><p><em>‘Children make everybody late’.</em><br/><em> You are an inconvenience Agatha.</em></p><p>Agatha’s breath left her in a quiet rush. Her vision blurred at the edges as her body reacted before her mind could catch up. </p><p>No. It wasn’t possible. </p><p>“That’s all she said?” Agatha asked, her voice carefully neutral.</p><p>Debbie nodded. “She whispered something to Gabby, I…I couldn't make it out but it sounded like she called her a name. It sounded like… Agatha? I’m sorry Dr Harkness, I was so tired I could have just imagined it..”</p><p>The words barely left Debbie’s mouth when Agatha’s phone vibrated violently against her hip.</p><p>Once.</p><p> Then again.</p><p>The sound felt deafening in the quiet room.</p><p>Agatha pulled it out with fingers that suddenly felt numb. Her eyes skimmed the notification, and the world seemed to tilt beneath her feet.</p><p><strong>HOSPITAL ALERT: CODE GREY. LOCKDOWN. MISSING PATIENT.  ALL STAFF REMAIN VIGILANT. REPORT SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY IMMEDIATELY.</strong></p><p>Her breath left her in a sharp, silent rush.</p><p>There it was.</p><p>Confirmation.</p><p>Evanora.</p><p>Agatha’s hand tightened around the phone until her knuckles ached. Her heart was pounding so hard she could feel it in her throat, each beat louder than the last.</p><p>“She had a badge,” Debbie said weakly, watching Agatha’s face with dawning fear. “She said she worked here.”</p><p>Agatha looked up slowly.</p><p>Her expression had changed completely.</p><p>“I have to report this,” she said, voice low and deadly calm. “Don’t worry Debbie, everything will be alright.”</p><p>The daycare worker nodded immediately, already reaching for the door. Debbie’s eyes widened as tears began to fall and her breathing quickened. </p><p>“Dr Harkness,” Debbie whispered. “What’s happening? Where is my daughter?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t answer.</p><p>She was already moving, already calling security, already running through floor plans in her head. </p><p>Stairwells. Exits. Elevators. Blind spots.</p><p>She had to find her. </p><p>Find them both.</p><p>As she rounded the corner just outside the ER, she saw Natasha mid-conversation with two security guards. Their postures were tight, shoulders squared, voices low but urgent.</p><p>Natasha looked up.</p><p>The moment her eyes met Agatha’s, the colour drained from her face.</p><p>“Is it her?” Agatha shouted, the words tearing out of her before she could stop them. She didn’t slow down. Didn’t lower her voice. “Is it Evanora?”</p><p>“Yes,” Natasha said quickly, hands lifting in a reflexive attempt to calm her. “But listen to me. The hospital is in lockdown. Security has confirmed she hasn’t left the building. We will find her.”</p><p>Agatha let out a sharp, broken laugh that held no humour at all. “She kidnapped my patient’s <em>child</em>, Nat.”</p><p>Natasha froze.</p><p>“What?” she said, the word barely audible.</p><p>“She impersonated daycare staff,” Agatha snapped, rage and terror colliding in her chest. “She took a three-year-old girl and walked her out of a patient’s room like she belonged to her. No one knows where she took her.”</p><p>For a split second, Natasha looked genuinely shaken.</p><p>“Oh my God.”</p><p>She turned sharply to the security guards still standing there, their expressions pale now, the weight of it finally landing.</p><p>“Notify the police,” Natasha ordered, voice iron-hard. “Now! This is a child abduction.”</p><p>One of the guards was already moving, hand to his radio.</p><p>Agatha exhaled, the breath unsteady, panic written plainly across her features as she raked a hand through her hair and turned in a slow circle, the corridor suddenly too long, too quiet.</p><p><em>Where are you, Evanora?</em></p>

<p>“Agatha, I need you to go to the attending locker rooms and stay there until I tell you to come out,” Natasha said firmly.</p><p>Agatha stared at her like she’d misheard.</p><p>“Are you insane?” she snapped, the words tearing out of her as panic finally broke through whatever restraint she’d been clinging to. “I’m not sitting on my ass while that psycho has Gabby.”</p><p>Her heart was hammering now, loud enough she could feel it in her throat. Every instinct in her body was screaming <em>move, find her, do something</em>. Standing still felt impossible and wrong.</p><p>“Agatha,” Natasha said, lowering her voice, forcing calm into every syllable, “we will find her. The police are on their way. Security is sweeping the building.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, fury and terror tangling in her chest until she couldn’t tell one from the other. Images kept flashing through her mind unbidden- Gabby’s small hand in someone else’s grip, Evanora’s voice dripping with contempt, that phrase echoing like a bruise.</p><p><em>Children make everybody late.</em></p><p>“The last thing I need,” Natasha continued, just as evenly, “is Evanora getting her claws into you too.”</p><p>That landed harder than Agatha expected.</p><p>Because it was true.</p><p>Because some small, traitorous part of her knew that if Evanora saw her now—raw, exposed, desperate—it would be like blood in the water.</p><p>Wanda jogged up then, breathless, eyes wide with alarm. “What’s going on?” she asked quickly. <br/>
“Someone said a child is missing too?”</p><p>Natasha closed her eyes briefly and rubbed at her temple, the strain finally cracking through her composed exterior. “Yes,” she said quietly. “A three-year-old. And it’s connected.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed, her throat tight, her hands trembling at her sides. She hated this. Hated being sidelined. Hated that the one time she wanted to act, to protect, to stay and fight, she was being told to step back.</p><p>“Please,” Natasha said again, this time softer, almost raw. She met Agatha’s eyes. “Just… please. Stay in the staff room until we’ve secured her. I can’t do this if I’m also worrying about you too.”</p><p>For a moment, Agatha looked like she might argue anyway. Her jaw clenched. Her shoulders were rigid, every line of her body screaming defiance.</p><p>Then she turned sharply on her heel.</p><p>“I’m not hiding,” she said flatly as she stalked toward the staff room. “I’m waiting.”</p><p>The distinction mattered to her, even if no one else heard it.</p><p><br/>
The door to the staff room shut behind her with a dull, final thud.</p><p>Agatha ripped her white coat off like it was strangling her, the weight of it suddenly unbearable. She flung it to the floor without looking and collapsed into one of the padded chairs, the vinyl creaking under her. Her elbows came down hard on her knees as she buried her face in her hands, fingers threading into her hair and gripping tight at the roots like she could anchor herself there.</p><p>She squeezed her eyes shut.</p><p><em>You can’t just sit here.</em></p><p>The thought pulsed in time with her heartbeat, loud and insistent. The room felt too small, too still, like it was mocking her. Every second stretched thin and sharp.</p><p>Gabby needed her.</p><p>The image of the little girl’s face rose unbidden, all wide eyes and unfiltered trust, the way she’d wrapped her arms around her mother’s neck earlier that day. Agatha’s chest constricted painfully.</p><p>Debbie couldn’t do anything in the state she was in. Too weak to sit up, too exhausted to fight, trapped in a hospital bed while someone else walked away with her child.</p><p>And Agatha was here.</p><p>Waiting.</p><p>Useless.</p><p>Her breath stuttered as anger surged, hot and bitter. She pushed her palms harder into her eyes, as if pressure alone could force the panic back into order.</p><p>She had to do something.</p><p>Standing still went against everything she was. She had built her entire life around action, around fixing, cutting, saving. <em>Doing</em> was how she survived. Doing was how she stayed ahead of the fear.</p><p>And Evanora—<br/>
Agatha’s jaw clenched.</p><p>She knew firsthand how cruel her mother could be. Not the loud, chaotic cruelty people expected, but the quiet, precise kind. Words chosen to cut. Neglect disguised as indifference. Punishment delivered with a smile.</p><p>And now Evanora was sick. Confused. Slipping.</p><p>The thought chilled her more than anything else.</p><p>If that cruelty had survived intact while everything else fractured… if Evanora’s mind was blurring past and present, mistaking a child for the daughter she’d once discarded…</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted.</p><p>She pressed her forehead to her knees and drew in a shaky breath.</p><p><em>I will not let her do this again.</em></p><p>Not to another child.</p><p>Not on her watch.</p><p>Agatha made it exactly five minutes.</p><p>Five long, miserable minutes of staring at the same scuffed tile, of listening to the hum of the vents and the distant echo of raised voices down the hall, before the need to <em>move</em> became unbearable.</p><p>She pushed up out of the chair and crossed the room in three strides, easing the door open just enough to peer into the corridor. Her pulse spiked immediately, instinct flaring. She scanned left, then right.</p><p>No Natasha.</p><p>Good.</p><p>She was just about to slip out when the sound of hurried footsteps and sharp voices carried toward her. Agatha froze. Without thinking, she pulled the door almost shut again, leaving it open the barest crack.</p><p>“This just keeps getting better, fuck,” Natasha snapped as she strode down the corridor, her voice tight with frustration. Agatha could hear the anger underneath it now, the strain finally bleeding through the professional calm.</p><p>Wanda hurried alongside her, breathless. “Babe, slow down. What now?”</p><p>Agatha leaned closer to the door, heart hammering.</p><p>“Security just called,” Natasha said, dragging a hand through her hair. “The police are struggling to get here because of the fucking snow. Roads are a mess. They’re stuck.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>Of course they were. She pictured the roads outside, buried under weeks of snowfall, cars stalled, sirens muted by snowfall and ice.</p><p>Wanda reached out suddenly, grabbing Natasha by the arm and pulling her to a stop. The abruptness of it startled Agatha, even through the crack in the door.</p><p>“Nat. Look at me,” Wanda said firmly.</p><p>Agatha watched as Wanda cupped Natasha’s face with both hands, grounding her the way Agatha knew Rio would have done. Natasha’s shoulders were rigid, her jaw clenched so tightly it looked like it hurt.</p><p>“You need to calm down,” Wanda continued, softer now but no less steady. “Panicking won’t help. Take a breath. Think. What do we do?”</p><p>Natasha took a steadying breath, leaning into Wanda’s touch as if drawing strength from it. When she spoke again, her voice was calmer, more controlled.</p><p>“We split up,” she said. “We know this hospital better than anyone. I’ve left Kale in charge of the ER. Security is sweeping the basement levels first. You take the paeds wing. I’ll search the surgical floor.” Her jaw tightened. “She can’t have gone far.”</p><p>Wanda’s mouth curved into a small, resolute smile. She nodded and began to turn away, already shifting into motion beforeNatasha caught her by the waist, pulling her back without hesitation.</p><p>The kiss was brief but unmistakable. A silent promise pressed into a single moment.<br/>
Agatha’s eyes widened behind the door. She’d known, of course. Everyone had. But seeing it actually happen was different.</p><p>Natasha rested her forehead against Wanda’s for a heartbeat.</p><p>“Thank you,” she murmured.</p><p>Then she was gone, turning sharply and striding down the corridor toward the surgical floor, every inch of her all business again.</p><p>Wanda stayed where she was for just a second longer, watching Natasha disappear around the corner. <br/>
Then she straightened, squared her shoulders, and headed toward the paeds wing.</p><p>Once both of them disappeared in opposite directions down the corridor, Agatha waited.</p><p>She counted her breaths. One. Two. Three.</p><p>Then she slipped out of the staff room, closing the door behind her with deliberate care. Her senses sharpened instantly, every sound magnified, every flicker of movement registering as potential threat. She stayed close to the walls, moving with the quiet efficiency of someone who knew exactly how to exist unnoticed in hostile spaces.</p><p>Now she knew the search pattern.</p><p>Basement. Paeds. Surgical.</p><p>Which meant there were places no one was looking.</p><p>Her jaw set.</p><p>Agatha turned toward the stairwell and took it two steps at a time, heart pounding, lungs burning as she climbed toward the radiology floor. Her thoughts narrowed, laser-focused as she realised this wasn’t panic anymore. This was instinct. The same instinct that guided her hands in surgery, that told her when something was wrong before the monitors ever did.</p><p>Halfway up the next flight, she slowed.</p><p>Something was wrong.</p><p>She reached the landing and stopped dead.</p><p>At the top of the stairs leading higher, just barely visible against the dull concrete, was a small arm of plush fur, limp and unmistakable.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>She climbed the remaining steps slowly now, dread coiling tighter with every movement, until the object came fully into view.</p><p>Teddy.</p><p>The stuffed bear Gabby never went anywhere without. The one she’d proudly introduced to Agatha on their first meeting, held up like a sacred thing. The bear’s button eye stared back at her, one ear bent, abandoned on the stairwell like a breadcrumb.</p><p>Agatha crouched and picked it up with shaking hands.</p><p>Her chest constricted violently.</p><p>She looked up.</p><p>The stairwell didn’t continue past the next landing.</p><p>There was no floor above radiology.</p><p>Only the roof.</p><p>“Oh God,” she whispered.</p><p>Adrenaline flooded her system, cold and electric. Every fear she’d been holding back slammed into place with brutal clarity.</p><p>Agatha surged to her feet and sprinted up the final flight of stairs, Teddy clenched tight in her fist, the echo of her footsteps pounding like a countdown.</p><p>Because she knew.</p><p>This was worse than she first thought.</p><p>And she was done being afraid.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>
Rio hadn’t thought much of the callout at first. Snow-related assists had become routine over the last few weeks, the firehouse working in tandem with the local plow crews as storms stacked on top of storms and the roads grew more treacherous by the day. Stalled patrol cars. Jackknifed sedans. The quiet, unglamorous work of winter.</p><p>She was used to it.</p><p>Still, as she climbed into the fire truck, tugging her gloves on and settling into the familiar hum of the engine, her thoughts drifted easily and instinctively to Agatha. They always did when her hands were busy and her mind had room to wander.</p><p>She wondered how Agatha was holding up on shift. Whether she’d eaten. Whether she’d remembered to sleep. Whether she had time to visit Gabby that day.</p><p>“So, Vidal,” Bucky called from the driver’s seat, the snow plow at the front of the truck clanking softly as he pulled out of the fire house. “You and Doc spending the day together tomorrow?”</p><p>Rio smiled without meaning to, the kind that started somewhere in her chest and spread outward. It was automatic now, unguarded. The guys had noticed months ago. Teased her relentlessly at first. Then, when it became clear this wasn’t just a fling, they’d stopped.</p><p>“Nah,” Rio said easily. “She’s working tomorrow. Double shift.”</p><p>She felt a familiar flicker of pride mixed with worry. Agatha never did anything halfway. It was part of what Rio loved about her, even when it scared her a little.</p><p>“But,” Rio added, glancing out the window as snow drifted past, “we’ll do our own thing on the twenty-sixth.”</p><p>Tony perked up immediately from the passenger seat, eyebrows waggling. “Oh, I bet you will.”</p><p>Rio leaned forward and smacked the back of his head without hesitation. “Shut up, Stark.”</p><p>Tony laughed, rubbing at the spot. “Hey, watch the hair.”</p><p>“I meant,” Rio said, grinning now despite herself, “we’re going to Lilia’s for dinner. A very normal, very wholesome dinner.”</p><p>Bucky snorted as he eased the truck into gear. “Sure it is.”</p><p>It didn’t take long to find the stranded patrol cars. They hadn’t made it far from the station at all, two cruisers half-buried in snow at the edge of the road, hazard lights blinking uselessly against the white.</p><p>Rio jumped down from the truck as soon as it rolled to a stop, boots crunching hard into packed snow. </p><p>Tony was already grabbing the cable, and together they moved on instinct, muscle memory taking over as they worked to secure the first patrol car to the back of the engine. Ahead of them, Bucky was manoeuvring the truck, lining it up to plow a clean path forward.</p><p>“Hey, Jimmy,” Tony called out with a grin as he approached Deputy Jimmy Woo, cable slung over his shoulder. “Need a hand, or you wanna sit there and enjoy the weather?”</p><p>“Fuck off, Stark, and move it,” Jimmy shot back, though there was no real heat in it. His gaze shifted. <br/>
“Hey, Rio.”</p><p>“Hey, Jimmy,” Rio replied easily, crouching to help Tony fasten the cable. “How’s Mrs. Woo?”</p><p>Jimmy snorted. “Pissed I’m out here on Christmas Eve, no doubt. I was five minutes from clocking off when we got the call from the hospital.”</p><p>Rio stilled.</p><p>“What?” she asked, straightening slowly.</p><p>Jimmy shrugged, tapping snow from his gloves. “Some wacko patient from Westview General went AWOL. Kidnapped a little girl.”</p><p>The words hit Rio like a punch to the chest.</p><p>Her breath caught, sharp and sudden.</p><p>“Hey, Woo, less chatting, more driving!” another officer yelled from the second cruiser, still stuck farther back.</p><p>Tony finished securing the cable and gestured for Jimmy to get back in the car. “All set. Hop in.”</p><p>“Wait,” Rio said, her voice cutting through the noise.</p><p>She followed Jimmy to the driver’s side, her heart already racing. “What was the patient’s name?”</p><p>Jimmy paused, frowning slightly as he climbed into the seat. He typed into the computer mounted on the dash, the glow reflecting faintly off the windshield.</p><p>“Uh… Evanora Harkness,” he said. “And the kid’s Gabriella Jenkins. Why?”</p><p>The world tilted.</p><p>Rio felt the blood drain from her face so fast she had to brace herself against the door.</p><p>“Buckle your seatbelt, Jimmy,” she said flatly.</p><p>“What—?” he started.</p><p>She shut the door firmly before he could finish and turned on her heel, sprinting back toward the fire truck. She hauled herself into the cab, hands shaking as she slammed the door shut.</p><p>“Bucky,” she said, already yanking her seatbelt on, “get us to the hospital. Now.”</p><p>Bucky stared at her, confused. “Rio, what—”</p><p>“MOVE. GO!” she shouted, voice cracking like a whip.</p><p>That snapped him out of it.</p><p>“Jesus—okay, okay!” Bucky swore, slamming his foot on the gas. The engine roared to life as the truck lurched forward, snow spraying up around them. In the side mirror, Rio saw the patrol car finally ease free of the embankment, still tethered behind them.</p><p>“BUCKY!” Tony shouted from the road, hands thrown in the air as his figure shrank rapidly in the distance. “What the fuck, man?”</p><p>Rio didn’t look back.</p><p>All she could see was Agatha’s face.</p><p>And all she could think was that somewhere in that hospital, Gabby was alone with the worst person Agatha had ever known.</p><p>She fumbled with her phone, nearly dropping it as the truck jolted over uneven ice. She dialled Agatha’s contact, thumb hovering anxiously as the call rang out, each tone stretching longer than the last.</p><p>“Come on, baby,” she muttered under her breath, voice tight. “Answer the damn phone.”</p><p>No answer.</p><p>Her knee bounced uncontrollably as she tried again, eyes fixed on the road ahead even though she wasn’t the one driving.</p><p>“You wanna tell me what the hell’s going on?” Bucky asked, knuckles white on the steering wheel as the fire truck barrelled toward the hospital, Jimmy’s patrol car fishtailing behind them on the cable.</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. “Agatha’s mother,” she said finally. “She took a kid from the hospital.”</p><p>Bucky’s expression darkened instantly. “Jesus.”</p><p> </p><p>At the same time—<br/>
Agatha slowed as she reached the door leading up to the rooftop, heart pounding so hard it drowned out everything else. Instinctively, she patted down her scrub pockets, already forming the words she needed to say to Natasha.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Her hands stilled.</p><p>She checked again. Thigh pocket. Waistband. Chest.</p><p>Nothing.</p><p>Her stomach dropped.</p><p>“Shit,” she whispered, panic flaring as the realisation hit. Her phone was still in her white coat. The coat she’d torn off and left crumpled on the staff room floor.</p><p>She closed her eyes for half a second, forced herself to breathe, then pushed the door open anyway.</p><p> </p>

<p>The rooftop door creaked as Agatha pushed it open.</p><p>Cold air rushed in immediately, sharp and biting, carrying the faint hiss of falling snow and the distant hum of the town below. The roof lights cast long, harsh shadows across the concrete, turning every vent and railing into something vaguely threatening.</p><p>“Gabby?” Agatha called, keeping her voice low, controlled. Not wanting to startle. Not wanting to provoke.</p><p>Her heart was hammering so hard it felt like it might bruise her ribs.</p><p>She scanned the roof quickly. HVAC units. A maintenance shed. Snow piled unevenly along the edges. No small footprints that she could see immediately, but the wind was already covering the ground again, erasing evidence as fast as it appeared.</p><p>“Evanora,” she said next, more firmly.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Agatha moved forward slowly, Teddy clutched in her hand like a talisman, the cold wind chilling her bare arms. Every instinct she had was screaming now, her body buzzing with adrenaline, fear sharpening her senses into something almost painful.</p><p>Then she heard it.</p><p>A small, sniffling sound. Soft. Unmistakably childlike.</p><p>Agatha froze.</p><p>“Gabby,” she said again, gentler now. “It’s okay. I’m right here.”</p><p>She followed the sound toward the far corner of the roof, near the low wall that overlooked the street below. And that’s when she saw her.</p><p>Gabby was sitting on the ground, knees pulled up to her chest, small hands fisted into her jacket. Snow clung to her curls and the shoulders of her coat. Her face was blotchy with tears.</p><p>And standing over her—<br/>Evanora.</p><p>She looked smaller than Agatha remembered, bundled in an oversized coat that swallowed her frame, her hair wild and unkempt. But her eyes were sharp. Focused in the wrong way.</p><p>In her right hand, she held something that made Agatha’s breath stop entirely.</p><p>A No.10 blade scalpel.</p><p>It caught the rooftop light as Evanora shifted, the blade glinting dully, her fingers wrapped around it with careless familiarity.</p><p>“Stand up,” Evanora said without turning around. “You always slouch. Always making a fool out of me.”</p><p>Agatha’s blood ran cold.</p><p>“Evanora,” she said carefully, each word measured. “Step away from her.”</p><p>Evanora turned then, her expression shifting, confusion flickering briefly across her face before settling into something disturbingly familiar.</p><p>She looked at Gabby.</p><p>Then at Agatha.</p><p>Her lips curled, not quite a smile. Not quite a sneer.</p><p>“I know you,” Evanora said slowly. Then, suspicion crept into her voice. “Who are you?”</p><p>Agatha forced a steady breath into her lungs, even as her pulse roared in her ears. “It’s me, Evanora,” she said gently. “Agatha. Your daughter.”</p><p>Evanora’s brow furrowed. Her gaze flicked sharply to Gabby, then back to Agatha, as if she were trying to line two mismatched pictures up in her mind. The confusion was visible now, creeping in around the edges of her expression, unsettling and volatile.</p><p>Then she laughed.</p><p>It was short. Harsh. Cutting.</p><p>“Don’t lie to me,” Evanora snapped. “You people always lie.” She lifted the scalpel slightly, the blade glinting as she punctuated each word. “You think I don’t recognise your interference? You’re from social services, aren’t you? Always sniffing around. Always trying to take what isn’t yours.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach twisted.</p><p>Without breaking eye contact, Evanora reached back and grabbed a long metal pole leaning against the maintenance shed. With a sudden, alarming burst of strength, she rammed it through the handles of the rooftop door, jamming it tight. The metal rang out sharply as it wedged into place, echoing across the roof.</p><p>Agatha felt her heart drop straight through her chest.</p><p>The door wasn’t opening now.</p><p>Not from either side.</p><p>“There,” Evanora said, breath coming fast, eyes bright with something close to triumph. “Now you can’t run off and spread your lies to the world.” Her gaze snapped back to Gabby, possessive and sharp.</p><p>“This is between me and my daughter.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, fighting the urge to lunge forward and grab Gabby outright. She could see it now, the fracture in Evanora’s mind, past and present bleeding together.</p><p>“She’s not me,” Agatha said, voice steady through sheer force of will. “She’s a little girl. And she’s scared.”</p><p>Evanora frowned, eyes narrowing as if the world wasn’t aligning the way it should. “She’s always scared,” she said. “She’s always been a coward!”</p><p>Agatha took one slow step closer.</p><p>“You’re hurting her,” she said quietly. “And you don’t want to do that.”</p><p>For a moment, something wavered in Evanora’s expression.</p><p>And far below—</p><p>Sirens.</p><p>The sound cut through the cold air like a blade.</p><p>Evanora jerked toward the edge of the roof, peering down as flashing red and blue lights spilled across the snow-covered street. A fire truck crawled into view, hauling a police cruiser behind it, lights strobing wildly against the surrounding buildings.</p><p>Her breath hitched.</p><p>She spun back toward Agatha, fury igniting across her features. “You!” she screamed, arm snapping up as she pointed the scalpel straight at her. “You called the police!”</p><p>Gabby’s sobs escalated instantly, the sirens and shouting overwhelming her. She cried harder now, small hands shielding her ears, body shaking.</p><p>Agatha lifted her hands slowly, palms open, forcing herself to stay calm even as fear clawed up her spine.</p><p>“No,” she said firmly. “Evanora, listen to me. I didn’t call anyone.”</p><p>Even as the words left her mouth, Agatha could feel how thin the line was beneath her feet. One wrong tone, one hint of accusation, and everything could fracture. She forced her shoulders to stay relaxed, forced her breath to slow, even as her pulse thundered in her ears.</p><p>Evanora didn’t lower the blade.</p><p>Agatha felt the flash of terror then, sharp and bright. Not for herself. For the way the scalpel trembled in Evanora’s hand, for how close Gabby was to her, for how easily this could tip into something irreversible. </p><p>She took a careful step forward instead, keeping her movements deliberate and as non-threatening as possible.</p><p>Every instinct screamed at her to grab Gabby and run. To end this by force. But she knew better. She had lived through Evanora’s cruelty once already. She knew how the woman reacted when she felt challenged or cornered. Fear made Evanora vicious. Control made her reckless.</p><p>“You’re not well,” Agatha continued, her voice steady despite the storm raging inside her. “And that little girl is not your daughter. Her name is Gabriella Jenkins. She’s three years old. Her mother—Debbie—is my patient. And right now, she’s terrified.”</p><p>She watched Evanora closely as she spoke, cataloguing every flicker of reaction the way she would a patient on the brink. The tightening jaw. The narrowing eyes. The way Evanora’s fingers flexed around the handle of the scalpel.</p><p>Evanora’s grip tightened.</p><p>Agatha felt her chest constrict painfully at the sight. She thought of Debbie, pale and helpless in a hospital bed, begging her to keep her baby safe. She thought of Gabby’s trust, the way she had reached for Agatha’s hand without hesitation earlier that day. She could not fail them.</p><p>“You took her from her mother,” Agatha said gently but clearly. “But this doesn’t have to get worse. It can end here.”</p><p>The words were chosen carefully. No blame. No condemnation. Just truth, wrapped in an offer of an exit.<br/>She swallowed hard, shoving down the old rage, the years of hurt, the instinct to recoil. This wasn’t about her. It couldn’t be.</p><p>Not about the little girl she had been. Not about the scars Evanora had left behind. If she let any of that surface now, Evanora would sense it. Exploit it. Twist it.</p><p>“If you put the scalpel down,” Agatha said, “and let Gabby come with me, we’ll get you help. Real help. You don’t have to do this.”</p><p>As she said it, Agatha locked her gaze onto Gabby for just a second, letting the child see her calm, her certainty. A silent promise passed between them.</p><p><em>It's okay, I’ve got you.</em></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>The hospital loomed out of the snow as the fire truck rolled into the emergency bay, tires crunching hard against ice.</p><p>Rio barely registered the building at first. Her focus was on getting there, on movement, on the tight, coiled urgency that had been riding her chest since Jimmy said the names out loud. She jumped down from the cab before the truck fully stopped, boots hitting pavement, breath fogging sharply in front of her.</p><p>Then something tugged at her attention.</p><p>A ripple of motion at the edge of her vision.</p><p>Rio slowed, frowning, and followed the instinct upward.</p><p>At first, she saw nothing but the roofline swallowed in snowfall and grey light. Then she saw movement again. </p><p>Her heart dropped.</p><p>Three figures could just be made out on the rooftop.</p><p>One impossibly small.</p><p>“No,” she whispered, dread detonating all at once. “No, no—”</p><p>She was already moving, panic sharpening every edge of her awareness. Natasha and two security guards burst through the ER doors at the same moment, radios crackling, faces tight with alarm.</p><p>“Fucking finally! We haven’t found them yet,” Natasha snapped to Jimmy as she rushed forward. “No sign on any floor—”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate.</p><p>“Nat, look,” she said, cutting in sharply, pointing up at the roof, her voice raw. “There’s people up there. That <em>has</em> to be them.”</p><p>Natasha followed her line of sight, her breath catching as her gaze snapped upward. Her expression blanched instantly.</p><p>“Security—move!” she barked.</p><p>The guards were already running, disappearing back inside toward the stairwells, boots pounding against tile.</p><p>Jimmy radio'd back to the station requesting more back up while Rio stood frozen for half a second, eyes locked on the roof, watching the figures shift against the snow. </p><p>One of them moved too erratically. Too close to the edge.</p><p>Nats radio crackled.</p><p>“Chief, stairwell access is blocked,” a guard reported, breathless. “Rooftop door’s jammed. We can’t open it from inside.”</p><p>Rio exhaled sharply, something feral flashing through her chest.</p><p>“Shit.”</p><p>She spun toward Bucky, already knowing what she was going to say.</p><p>“Get me up there.”</p><p>Bucky stared at her. “Rio—”</p><p>“Now,” she snapped, already climbing onto the side of the truck and grabbing the ladder rungs. Her hands were steady despite the storm ripping through her chest. Snow stung her face as the ladder began to whine, metal shifting as it extended upward.</p><p>“Vidal!” Jimmy shouted, hurrying toward the truck, one hand raised. “Don't even think about it! You need to wait. We’ve got backup coming—this isn’t protocol.”</p><p>Rio shot him a look over her shoulder, eyes blazing.</p><p>“Fuck that!” she barked. “That’s my girlfriend up there. You can write me up later.”</p><p>“Rio—” Jimmy tried again.</p><p>Bucky didn’t even look at him. He swore under his breath and slammed his hand down on the controls. </p><p>“Jesus, Vidal. Hold on.”</p><p>The ladder surged higher.</p><p><br/>Back on the rooftop, Agatha’s concern sharpened into something close to panic.</p><p>Gabby had gone quiet.</p><p>The small, broken whimpers had faded, replaced by a frightening stillness. Her head lolled against her shoulder, eyes fluttering, lashes heavy with snow and exhaustion. The cold was sinking into her tiny body faster than Agatha could stop it.</p><p><em>No. No, no.</em></p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened painfully.</p><p>She was running out of time.</p><p>“Evanora,” Agatha said, voice cutting through the wind, “listen to me. That little girl is not your daughter.” She took another careful step forward. “I am. Your issue is with me, not her.”</p><p>“Stop lying!” Evanora shrieked, screwing her eyes shut as if the truth itself offended her.</p><p>Something in Agatha snapped.</p><p>“If I were lying,” Agatha shouted, her composure finally cracking, “then how would I know that for my tenth birthday you left me alone to go on a fucking date with the local <em>pastor</em> and didn’t come home for two days?”</p><p>Her voice broke, rage and grief colliding as tears burned behind her eyes.</p><p>“Or the time the school called because I was sick,” she went on, chest heaving now, “and you left me on the back porch in the rain to teach me a lesson for interrupting your day! I was <em>seven</em> years old!”</p><p>The words tore out of her, years of silence collapsing all at once.</p><p>Evanora’s eyes flew open.</p><p>She stared at Agatha, really looked at her, the confusion draining away as recognition finally locked into place. The moment stretched unbearably long.</p><p>Then Evanora’s mouth twisted into a familiar sneer.</p><p>“You’re still evil,” she said coldly. “Just like you were back then.”</p><p>Agatha laughed sharply, the sound broken and incredulous. “I’m not the one who kidnapped a little girl at knifepoint.”</p><p>“I was correcting a mistake!” Evanora barked, her voice rising as she took a slow step toward Agatha.</p><p>Another.</p><p>Her attention had shifted completely now. Gabby was no longer the focus. The child sagged limply against the wall, eyes slipping closed, fingers barely twitching.</p><p>All of Evanora’s fury was fixed on Agatha.</p><p>And Agatha understood with chilling clarity what that meant.</p><p>If she didn’t end this right now, Gabby wouldn’t make it.</p><p>Agatha moved without thinking.</p><p>She lunged, reaching for Evanora’s wrist, aiming to knock the scalpel from her grasp before she could register what was happening. For a split second, she almost had it.</p><p>Then Evanora reacted.</p><p>Faster than Agatha expected, the older woman twisted sharply, her free hand clamping down around Agatha’s forearm with surprising strength. At the same time, the hand holding the scalpel swung downward in a wild, reflexive arc.</p><p>Agatha felt the impact before the pain.</p><p>A sharp, tearing sensation flared just above her hip as the blade caught her side, slicing through the thin fabric of her scrubs. She gasped, breath hitching violently as she stumbled back, instinctively clutching at the wound.</p><p>Cold air hit exposed skin.</p><p>Agatha looked down in detached disbelief as small drops of red began to dot the snow at her feet, stark against the white.</p><p>Her mind snapped into motion immediately, the surgeon in her taking over even as her heart hammered.<br/><em>Soft tissue,</em> she assessed automatically. <em>Shallow. Not arterial. Not deep enough to be catastrophic.</em></p><p>A flesh wound.</p><p>Painful. Bleeding.</p><p>But survivable.</p><p>She tightened her jaw, forcing herself upright despite the burn radiating through her side, eyes never leaving Evanora.</p><p>Because if she let herself focus on the pain for even a second—</p><p>Gabby would be lost.</p><p>“Agatha!”</p><p><br/>The sound of Rio’s voice cut through the wind, raw and broken.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up just in time to see Rio vault from the ladder onto the roof, boots skidding slightly on the snow as she landed. For a split second, she looked feral—eyes wide, chest heaving, every line of her body pulled taut between terror and rage.</p><p>Evanora reacted instantly.</p><p>The moment Rio appeared, Evanora’s attention snapped back to Agatha, her face twisting with alarm and fury. She stepped closer, shoes slipping slightly in the snow, the scalpel lifting higher in her grip.</p><p>And then Rio saw it.</p><p>The dark stain spreading along Agatha’s side. The way her hand was pressed there, fingers slick, shoulders held rigid through sheer will.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched violently, a strangled sound tearing out of her before she could stop it.</p><p>“Oh my god—”</p><p>Her gaze darted wildly, taking everything in at once- Evanora standing rigid and wild-eyed, the scalpel flashing in her hand, the metal pole jamming the door and the small red spots of blood on the snow beside Agatha.</p><p>“No,” Rio whispered. “No, no, no…”</p><p>She moved instinctively toward Agatha, panic overriding everything else—</p><p>“Rio.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice cut through it. Calm. Grounded. Commanding in a way that left no room for argument.</p><p>“Rio, I need you to take Gabby to safety right now,” Agatha said, each word measured despite the pain burning through her side. “She’s showing signs of hypothermia. She needs to get warm. Now.”</p><p>Rio’s head snapped toward Gabby, and whatever was left of her composure shattered at the sight.</p><p>The little girl was curled into herself on the snow, too still, her breath shallow and uneven. Her cheeks were pale beneath tear tracks already freezing cold.</p><p>“Oh—God,” Rio whispered.</p><p>She dropped to her knees immediately, heedless of the snow soaking through her pants, one gloved hand hovering over Gabby’s small shoulder before finally settling there. Even through layers, the cold of her body shocked her. She was freezing cold.</p><p>Rio moved without thinking about it.</p><p>Her jacket was off in seconds, shrugged from her shoulders and wrapped tightly around Gabby, cocooning her small frame, pressing every scrap of warmth she had into the child. She pulled Gabby close, tucking her chin protectively, rocking slightly as if that alone could fix this.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” she murmured desperately. “I’ve got you, sweetheart. Stay with me.”</p><p>She looked up then—back to Agatha.</p><p>Her eyes were shining, panic spilling over, her voice breaking around the truth she didn’t want to say.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio whispered. “I can’t leave you here with her.”</p><p>The thought felt unbearable. Like being asked to tear herself in half and choose which part to abandon.</p><p>Agatha met her gaze.</p><p>Blood soaked through the side of her scrubs, dark and stark against the white, but her eyes were steady. Fierce. Anchored entirely on Rio.</p><p>“Rio, please,” Agatha said softly now, the edge gone from her voice. “She doesn’t have much time.”</p><p>The words landed like a physical blow.</p><p>“Leave her, with me.” Evanora sneered.</p><p>Rio’s throat closed. Tears blurred her vision as she looked down at Gabby, then back at Agatha—at the woman she loved, standing alone with a blade between her and safety.</p><p>For a long, agonising moment, she looked utterly torn—caught between instinct and duty, between Agatha and Gabby.</p><p>Then she swallowed hard.</p><p>Her jaw set.</p><p>She nodded once, sharp and decisive, even as tears spilled freely down her face.</p><p>“I’m coming back,” Rio said fiercely, the promise trembling but unbreakable. “I swear to you.”</p><p>Agatha gave her the faintest nod. Enough.</p><p>Rio’s gaze shifted then—just for a moment—from Agatha to Evanora.</p><p>The look in her eyes was no longer panicked.</p><p>It was cold.</p><p>Deliberate.</p><p>“You touch her again,” Rio said, her voice low and deadly over the wind, “and I will end you. I don’t care who the fuck you are, or what’s wrong with you. I <em>will</em> kill you.”</p><p>Evanora sneered, lifting the scalpel a fraction higher, but there was something uncertain in her eyes now. </p><p>Something that recognised a predator.</p><p>Rio didn’t wait for a response.</p><p>She clutched Gabby close, pressing her face briefly into the child’s hair as if stealing strength from the moment. Then she backed toward the ladder, every step reluctant, every instinct screaming—<br/>Her eyes never left Agatha.</p><p>Not for a second.</p><p>Even as she turned to descend, even as the ladder waited below, Rio watched her—burning the image into herself like a vow.</p><p>Hold on.</p><p>I’m coming back.</p><p> </p><p><strong>(Authors Note- I did consider leaving this here for another cliffhanger... but decided to show some mercy instead.)</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>“I always knew you had <em>that</em> perversion,” Evanora hissed, her voice sharp with disgust. “You were rotten from the start. <em>Evil</em>. I should have killed you the moment you left my body.”</p><p>Her eyes locked onto Agatha with frightening clarity, as if the fog in her mind had parted just enough to sharpen the blade of her tongue.</p><p>Agatha felt the words hit her like a physical blow. Her breath stuttered, pain flaring hot in her side, but something else burned hotter still.</p><p>“Well why didn’t you?” she cried, the words tearing out of her before she could stop them. “Why didn’t you just kill me back then and get it over with?”</p><p>The snow whipped between them, clinging to Agatha’s lashes, melting against her flushed skin. For a moment, the roof felt impossibly small. Trapped. Like her childhood all over again.</p><p>Evanora didn’t answer right away.</p><p>Instead, her mouth curled into a slow, wicked smile.</p><p>“I suppose I lacked imagination,” she said lightly. “But I’ve been given another chance now, haven’t I?”</p><p> Her grip tightened around the scalpel. “To fix that mistake. To correct what I left behind with that… that woman.”</p><p>Her lip curled in pure venom.</p><p>“That <em>witch </em>Calderu.”</p><p>Something in Agatha snapped.</p><p>“Don’t you dare talk about her,” Agatha said, her voice shaking with fury. “Leaving me with Lilia was the only good thing ever did for me.”</p><p>Evanora laughed, a harsh, broken sound.</p><p>“She filled your head with nonsense,” she spat. “Made you weak. Made you think you deserved love.”</p><p>Agatha straightened despite the pain, despite the blood soaking through her scrubs, despite the fear clawing at her chest.</p><p>“She saved me,” Agatha said, each word steady and absolute. “She fed me. She held me. She taught me what love actually looks like. Everything good in me exists because you weren’t there to destroy it.”</p><p>Evanora’s smile faltered.</p><p>Just for a second.</p><p>Then her face hardened, eyes bright and unhinged.</p><p>“You were my biggest mistake” she said fiercely. “You always were.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head slowly, tears slipping free now, freezing cold against her skin.</p><p>“No,” she said. “I stopped being yours the day you walked away.”</p><p>The wind howled across the rooftop, sirens echoing faintly below, the city holding its breath.</p><p>Evanora took a step forward, scalpel catching the light.</p><p>Agatha didn’t retreat.</p><p>Not this time.</p><p>She planted her feet in the snow, heart pounding, mind razor-sharp despite the fear screaming through her veins.</p><p>“You don’t get to hurt anyone else,” Agatha said quietly. “Not me. Not Gabby. Not ever again.”</p><p>The ladder rattled against the edge of the roof.</p><p>Agatha heard it before she saw them, the metallic scrape followed by the thud of boots. She lifted her head just in time to see Rio haul herself up first, snow clinging to her navy t-shirt, breath coming fast and hard. </p><p>Jimmy followed a second later, gun already drawn, boots skidding slightly as he cleared the ladder and took in the scene.</p><p>They were still too far away.</p><p>Evanora stood with the scalpel raised, her body angled possessively toward Agatha, eyes sharp and unblinking.</p><p>Rio froze for half a second before she moved slowly and carefully.</p><p>She kept her hands visible, palms open, her voice low and steady despite the violent pounding in her chest.</p><p>“This stops now,” Rio said. “You’ve done enough damage Evanora.”</p><p>Evanora’s head snapped toward her.</p><p>Good.</p><p>Rio took another step, then another, angling her body so she stood squarely in Evanora’s line of sight. She wasn’t charging or making any sudden movements. </p><p>She was drawing attention, pulling it away from Agatha bit by but.</p><p>Jimmy stayed back, gun raised, trying to match Rio’s pace without escalating the situation.</p><p>“Ma’am,” he called, measured. “I need you to put the blade down. We’re here to help you.”</p><p>Evanora sneered, her gaze flicking briefly to the gun before locking back onto Rio.</p><p>“And who are <em>you</em> supposed to be?” she demanded.</p><p>Rio stopped walking.</p><p>She could sense Agatha behind her now, close enough to sense the subtle sway in her stance and the uneven rhythm of her breathing. Out of the corner of her eye, Rio caught the dark smear still spreading along Agatha’s side.</p><p>Too much blood.</p><p>Her chest tightened.</p><p>“I’m nobody,” Rio said evenly. “Just someone who wants to make sure nobody else gets hurt tonight.”</p><p>Evanora laughed, sharp and brittle.</p><p>“Another one,” she scoffed. “Always someone sticking their nose where it doesn’t belong.”</p><p>“Maybe,” Rio replied, taking another careful step, boots crunching softly in the snow. “But I’d rather die than let you anywhere near her again.”</p><p>Evanora hesitated.</p><p>Just for a fraction of a second.</p><p>Rio seized it by subtly positioning herself closer to Agatha, her body now almost fully between Evanora and the woman she loved. She didn’t touch Agatha yet, but she wanted to put as much of a barrier between her and Evanora as possible.</p><p>Jimmy swallowed and adjusted his grip on the gun. He looked nervous, but he held steady.</p><p>“Ma’am,” he said again, voice firmer now. “We can do this the easy way.”</p><p>Evanora’s attention flicked back to Agatha, then snapped to Rio as she noticed the movement.</p><p>“No,” Evanora hissed. “You stay where you are.”</p><p>Rio stopped instantly.</p><p>Hands still open.</p><p>“Okay,” she said softly. “I’ll stop.”</p><p>But her eyes never left the weapon in Evanora’s hand.</p><p>And her body stayed angled protectively toward Agatha.</p><p>Behind her, Agatha swallowed and forced herself upright as another wave of dizziness hit. She could feel the cold settling deeper now, the ache at her side burning and numb all at once.</p><p>Rio sensed the shift, her jaw tightening. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio said quietly, without turning. “Talk to me.”</p><p>“I’m here,” Agatha answered, though her voice wavered. “I’m okay”</p><p>Evanora smiled.</p><p>Cruel. Knowing.</p><p>“She’s fading,” Evanora said. “She’s weak.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes darkened.</p><p>She took one more step forward just asAgatha swayed.</p><p>Just once.</p><p>Then her knees buckled.</p><p>“Agatha—!”</p><p>Rio moved on pure instinct. She lunged, arms wrapping around Agatha’s torso just in time to keep her from hitting the ground. Agatha’s weight sagged fully into her, breath leaving her in a soft, broken sound as her head tipped forward.</p><p>“I’ve got you,” Rio murmured urgently, panic clawing up her throat as she tightened her grip. “I’ve got you, my love.”</p><p>Behind them, Evanora let out a sound that wasn’t quite human.</p><p>A roar of fury.</p><p>“No!” Evanora screamed, her face twisting with rage as she surged forward, scalpel raised high. “Leave her!”</p><p>Rio felt it before she saw it. The rush of air behind her. The sharp instinctive certainty that she was about to be hit. She shifted her body without thinking, turning just enough to shield Agatha, bracing for pain she never questioned taking while cradling Agatha in her arms. </p><p>The gunshot cracked through the air.</p><p>Loud and Final.</p><p>Evanora jerked mid-step, the scalpel slipping from her fingers as her body arched violently. A choked sound tore from her throat before she crumpled forward, hitting the snow-covered concrete with a heavy, wet thud.</p><p>She groaned, clutching at her back, fury dissolving into shock and pain.</p><p>For a heartbeat, no one moved.</p><p>Then chaos exploded.</p><p>“Police! Don’t move!”</p><p>The rooftop door burst open as Bucky and Tony slammed through it, muscles straining as they forced the jammed pole aside. Two uniformed officers surged in behind them, weapons drawn, boots pounding against the snow covered concrete.</p><p>“Weapon down!” one officer shouted, though Evanora was already writhing on the ground, hands empty, breath ragged.</p><p>Jimmy lowered his gun slowly, hands shaking now that the moment had passed. His chest heaved as he stared at Evanora, disbelief and adrenaline written across his face.</p><p>“I—I had a clear shot,” he said hoarsely. “She was about to—”</p><p>“You did good,” Rio snapped at Jimmy, though her voice shook and she still couldn’t bring herself to look at him. </p><p>Her entire world had narrowed to the woman sagging in her arms.</p><p>Agatha was conscious, but only just. Her skin was pale beneath the falling snow, her breath uneven and her pupils slightly unfocused. She blinked slowly, like the effort of keeping her eyes open cost her something.</p><p>Rio felt it immediately.</p><p>“Baby—,” Rio said, panic spilling over now, no longer contained. She dropped to her knees with her, arms tightening instinctively as if she could physically hold her together. Her hands trembled as they pressed at Agatha’s side, warm blood soaking through her gloves. “Hey. Hey, look at me. Stay with me. Please.”</p><p>Agatha winced, her head lolling slightly before she forced it upright again, stubborn even now. She squinted at Rio, trying to focus, her words coming out slow and slurred.</p><p>“Ri… you’re—” She swallowed. “You’re freaking out. It's fine”</p><p>Rio let out a broken laugh that sounded dangerously close to a sob. “Yeah,” she breathed. “Yeah, because you’re bleeding and pale and this is not fine.”</p><p>Agatha lifted a shaky hand, fingers brushing weakly against Rio’s t-shirt like she was grounding her instead.</p><p>“I’m okay,” Agatha murmured, the words thick on her tongue. “Just… dizzy. Lost a bit of blood. It could be worse.”</p><p>Rio shook her head violently, tears blurring her vision. “You do not get to say that right now. You do not get to downplay this.”</p><p>Agatha managed the faintest crooked smile. “Now who’s the bossy one?”</p><p>Rio pressed her forehead against Agatha’s, breath hitching, her voice dropping into something raw and pleading. “Don’t scare me like that. Don’t ever do that again.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered but stayed open. “Still here,” she whispered. “Promise.”</p><p>Rio exhaled shakily, gripping her tighter. “Good,” she said fiercely. “Because I’m not letting you go.”</p><p>Natasha moved in with calm, decisive speed, her voice cutting cleanly through the chaos.</p><p>“Alright,” she said firmly, already shrugging out of her coat. “I’ve got her.”</p><p>Wanda, Kate, and Alice were their in an instant, the four of them moving with the kind of coordination that only came from years of shared emergencies. Wanda slid in at Agatha’s shoulders, Kate took her legs, Alice steadied her hips. The stretcher was already waiting, snow dusting the metal frame.</p><p>“Agatha,” Natasha said, dropping into Agatha’s line of sight, her tone gentler now. “We're here, we're going to move you onto the stretcher, okay?”</p><p>Agatha blinked, slow but present, her eyes finding Natasha’s face.</p><p>“I’m fine,” she slurred faintly, stubborn even now. “Just… dizzy.”</p><p>Natasha gave her a look that managed to be both fond and no-nonsense. “You’re bleeding and hypothermic. I’ll decide if you’re fine.”</p><p>They lifted her carefully, smoothly, lowering her onto the stretcher. Agatha hissed softly at the movement, fingers tightening reflexively in the fabric of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>Rio didn’t let go.</p><p>She clung to Agatha like the world would end if she loosened her grip, one hand fisted in Agatha’s sleeve, the other cupping her face. Tears streamed freely now, unchecked, her breath coming in broken pulls.</p><p>“I’m here,” Rio kept saying, over and over, like a mantra. “I’m right here mi amor. I’ve got you.”</p><p>“Rio,” Natasha said quietly, resting a steady hand on her arm. “We need to move her.”</p><p>Rio shook her head, lips trembling, panic raw and unfiltered. “I can’t—Nat, I can’t let go. Please.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head weakly on the pillow, eyes finding Rio through the blur. She lifted her hand with effort, fingers brushing Rio’s cheek, smearing tears with her thumb.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha murmured, words thick but deliberate. “I’m… not going anywhere.”</p><p>Rio let out a strangled sound, pressing her forehead to Agatha’s for just a second before Natasha gently but firmly eased her back.</p><p>“You can walk with us,” Natasha said. “But you have to give them space to work.”</p><p>Reluctantly, shaking, Rio loosened her hold. Her hand lingered until the very last moment, fingertips trailing against Agatha’s wrist as the stretcher began to roll.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio said hoarsely.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved into the faintest smile, eyes never leaving her. “I know,” she whispered. “I can hear you crying from here.”</p><p>It wasn’t enough to make Rio laugh.</p><p>But it was enough to keep her moving, tears still falling as she followed close behind, refusing to be more than a step away as they rushed Agatha toward the stairwell and safety.</p>

<p>Agatha would have liked to say she took the pain like a champ. That she didn’t flinch, didn’t curse, didn’t instinctively try to smack Jen’s hand away when the first stitch went in.</p><p>That would have been a lie.</p><p>They’d started with a local anaesthetic, Jen warning her gently before the needle went in. Agatha braced herself, jaw clenched, reminding herself she could handle this. She was a surgeon. She had done this to other people a thousand times over.</p><p>It was different when it was her.</p><p>The anaesthetic dulled the sharpest edge of the pain, but it didn’t erase it. There was still pressure. Still the awful awareness of tugging and pulling at skin that was already too tender. She inhaled sharply, fingers curling into the mattress.</p><p>Across from her, Rio went rigid.</p><p>She flinched at the sight of the needle, at the faint pull of thread, her shoulders tensing like she was bracing for impact. Her eyes were glossy, rimmed red, lashes clumped together where tears had gathered. <br/>She kept swallowing hard, jaw clenched tight, clearly trying to keep it together.</p><p>Agatha noticed it right away.</p><p>Rio wasn’t sobbing. She wasn’t making a scene. She was doing that thing she always did when she was scared out of her mind, standing too still, breathing too carefully, like if she didn’t move the world might not notice how close she was to breaking.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha murmured, voice tight. “Why dont you go check on Gabby.”</p><p>Rio shook her head immediately, a sharp, almost angry motion. “I’m not leaving you again.”</p><p>Her voice wobbled despite the firmness of her words. She took a half step closer, hands hovering uselessly at her sides, fingers twitching like she was resisting the urge to grab Agatha and pull her away from all of it.</p><p>The room kept moving. Bodies in. Bodies out. Blood on gloves. A nurse stepped over something slick near the doorway.</p><p>Then Wanda appeared.</p><p>Agatha saw her through the haze—Wanda stopping short just inside the room. Saw the way her face drained of colour as her eyes landed on the blood soaked into Agatha’s scrubs. On the dried smear at her side. </p><p>On Rio, openly breaking.</p><p>Wanda’s hand flew to her mouth. Her eyes flicked from Agatha to Rio and back again, horror dawning fast and sharp.</p><p>“Oh my God,” Wanda breathed.</p><p>The first stitch drew a broken sound from Agatha’s throat.</p><p>Rio sucked in a breath like she’d been punched. Her eyes filled instantly, tears spilling over despite her best efforts. She scrubbed at her face quickly, turning her head just enough to hide it, but Agatha caught the way her shoulders shook once, just once, before she forced them still again.</p><p>“Oh God,” Rio whispered, barely audible. “Cant you give her something for the pain?”</p><p>The second stitch made Agatha gasp despite herself. Rio’s breath hitched sharply, her hands curling into fists at her sides.</p><p>Agatha hated this part more than the pain.</p><p>She hated watching Rio worry.</p><p>“I’m okay,” Agatha said, though the words came out strained. She tried to soften her voice, to make it believable. “Look at me. I’m fine.”</p><p>Rio looked back at her then, eyes swimming, face tight with restraint. She nodded quickly, too quickly, like she was afraid if she didn’t agree she might fall apart completely.</p><p>“I know,” Rio said, voice thick. “I know you are.”</p><p>But she didn’t sound convinced.</p><p>By the third stitch, Agatha was gripping the edge of the gurney hard enough that her knuckles ached. Her breathing stuttered despite her best attempts to control it.</p><p>Natasha sighed, sharp and decisive. “That’s enough.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha protested automatically, the words slurring together.</p><p>Natasha didn’t look at her. “You’re getting morphine.”</p><p>Agatha barely registered the IV being adjusted before the world softened. The pain ebbed, sliding away into something distant and manageable. Her body grew warm and heavy, her thoughts slow and loose.</p><p>“Oh,” she murmured faintly. “That’s… better.”</p><p>Through the haze, she became aware of Rio again, closer now, her composure finally cracking. Rio’s tears fell freely, silent but unstoppable, her hand clutching the bed near Agatha’s shoulder like she needed something solid to hold onto.</p><p>Rio’s face was turned slightly away, like she was still trying to spare Agatha the sight of her breaking.<br/>Agatha lifted her head a fraction, effortful.</p><p>“Hey,” she murmured softly. “Breathe.”</p><p>Rio’s breath shuddered. She turned back then, pressing her forehead gently against Agatha’s arm, tears soaking into the fabric.</p><p>“I almost lost you,” Rio whispered. “I can’t— I can’t lose you, mi amor.”</p><p>The words sank in slowly, settling somewhere deep in Agatha’s chest. Even through the haze, she understood this wasn’t just about tonight. It wasn’t just the blood, or the stitches, or the way everything had nearly gone wrong.</p><p>This fear was older than that.</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly, unfocused but sincere, and lifted her hand with effort, brushing her fingers along Rio’s cheek. </p><p>“I’m not going anywhere,” she said quietly. “I promise.”</p><p>Rio’s breath broke, a soft, wrecked sound, and she leaned into the touch like she’d been holding herself together by force alone.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, thoughts drifting and sharpening all at once. She’d seen this kind of fear before. In her own fears. The way love turned fragile when too much of it had already been taken away.</p><p>She thought about Rio’s past experience of loss. Parents gone too soon. An abuela who had been everything, and then wasn’t.</p><p> It sat there in Rio’s panic, in the way she clung to Agatha’s hand, the way her eyes tracked every flinch in her face.</p><p>Agatha’s thumb moved slowly, grounding them both.</p><p>“I’m still here,” she murmured, more for Rio than herself. “I’m not leaving.”</p><p>Rio nodded, small and shaky, pressing their joined hands to her lips. </p><p>When Jen tied off the final stitch, she sat back and looked at Agatha properly for the first time. </p><p>“Well,” she said, tugging off her gloves. “Not exactly a badass scar. But definitely a badass reputation.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a weak laugh.</p><p>Jen’s mouth twitched, then flattened again. “That was… brave. Going after her like that.” A beat. “And incredibly stupid, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, slow and loose, the morphine finally settling in fully. “Aw, Jenny,” she murmured. “Don’t tell me you were worried about me.”</p><p>Jen scoffed immediately, like the word offended her. “Please. I was annoyed.”</p><p>She turned away to dispose of the sharps, shoulders tense.</p><p>“…when I heard you hurt.”</p><p>Agatha caught it anyway. The hesitation. The way Jen didn’t look back. She felt something warm bloom in her chest that had nothing to do with the drugs.</p><p>“Mmh,” Agatha said sleepily. “That sounds like concern.”</p><p>Jen shot her a glare over her shoulder. “As if.”</p><p>Rio let out a shaky breath that might have been a laugh, her hand tightening just slightly around Agatha’s.</p><p>Alice chose that moment to reappear, leaning against the doorway with a knowing look and a grin she didn’t even try to hide.</p><p>“Right,” she said casually. “That’s why you started tearing up the second Nat told you to prep for a stab wound. Specifically Agatha’s stab wound.”</p><p>Jen shot her a glare sharp enough to cut glass. “I did not.”</p><p>Alice just raised a brow.</p><p>Jen’s eyes went wide. She busied herself with gathering supplies that absolutely did not need gathering. </p><p>“I’m… getting more saline,” she muttered, already halfway to the door.</p><p>Alice laughed softly as Jen made her escape.</p><p>Rio snorted, the sound surprised out of her, and she met Alice’s eyes. They shared a quiet, conspiratorial grin.</p><p>Natasha reentered a moment later, her expression all business but her tone gentler than before.</p><p>“The cops wanted to talk to both of you,” she said. “I told them now isn’t the time. They’ll be back later for statements.”</p><p>“Thank you, Nat,” Rio said, relief clear in her voice.</p><p>Natasha nodded, then turned her attention to Agatha, adjusting the IV with practiced ease. “I’m going to give you a little time to rest. You lost a fair amount of blood, so the fluids will help. Jen will be back shortly to check your levels. We’ll decide then if you need a transfusion, but for now I think we can avoid it.”</p><p>Agatha hummed faintly, eyes already drifting shut.</p><p>Natasha’s gaze softened for just a moment before she stepped back.<br/> “Try to sleep,” she said gently. “You’ve earned it.”</p><p>Agatha heard the door close. Felt the room settle.</p><p>Then the soft brush of Rio’s fingers against her forehead.</p><p>She cracked one eye open.</p><p>Rio was still there, still wrecked, her gaze fixed on the stitches at Agatha’s side like they might vanish if she watched closely enough.</p><p>“My love?” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped up to meet the one blue eye searching for her. Whatever fragile control she’d been holding onto shattered.</p><p>“I couldn’t protect you,” Rio said, the words tumbling out. “I— I thought… when I went down that ladder, I thought I’d never see you again.”</p><p>Her voice broke completely then, sobs racking her as the wall she’d kept upright since they’d entered the room finally collapsed.</p><p>Agatha opened both eyes now, vision still hazy with morphine, her body instinctively trying to move toward Rio despite the ache in her side. Every part of her wanted to reach out and soothe her.</p><p>She had never had someone care for her like this.</p><p>She’d known love from Lilia, steady and constant, shown in warm meals and safe spaces and quiet reassurance. But <em>this</em>—this raw, unguarded grief at the thought of losing her—was something else entirely.</p><p>Agatha had spent her life thinking of herself as self-contained. Singular. Someone whose absence would register, perhaps, but never devastate.</p><p>And yet here was Rio, breaking apart at the idea of a world without her.</p><p>The thought settled heavy and strange in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>For the first time, she understood that her existence mattered to someone in a way she had never allowed herself to imagine.</p><p>The irony wasn’t lost on her. For the past year, Agatha had kept her heart carefully guarded, afraid that if she let herself love Rio fully, she would only lose her.</p><p>Now here was that same woman—the one who had been unshakable in Agatha’s darkest moments—standing in front of her, breaking under the very same fear.</p><p>It struck Agatha with startling clarity that strength had never meant fearlessness.</p><p>It meant loving anyway.</p><p>And if Rio had carried her through despair with such patience and empathy, then Agatha would have to learn how to do the same. To meet her where she was. To hold her steady now, the way Rio had held her so many times before.</p><p>She owed her that.</p><p>But... Agatha was still Agatha. And not even a morphine-softened brain could stop the words from slipping out.</p><p>“You’re getting snot on me.”</p><p>For a split second, Rio froze—then her sobs broke apart into wet, breathless laughter. She scrubbed at her face, shaking her head as that familiar gap-toothed smile finally made its way back, the one Agatha had learned by heart, the one she found herself thinking about when she closed her eyes.</p><p>Agatha studied her through half-lidded eyes. The fear was still there, tucked beneath the surface, but it wasn’t swallowing her whole anymore. Agatha felt something steady settle in her own chest in response.</p><p>“Hey,” she murmured. “Come here.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then leaned closer, careful of Agatha’s side, perching awkwardly on the edge of the bed. Agatha lifted her hand, slow and deliberate, and rested it over Rio’s heart.</p><p>It was racing.</p><p>“See?” Agatha said quietly. “Still here. Both of us.”</p><p>Rio swallowed, nodding, and covered Agatha’s hand with her own. Her pulse slowly began to steady beneath their palms.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fluttered, exhaustion pulling her under again.</p><p>“I love you,” she murmured, barely louder than a breath.</p><p>Rio bent down and pressed a gentle kiss to Agatha’s forehead, lingering there.</p><p>“I love you too,” she whispered. “Sleep. I’ll be right here.”</p><p>And this time, when Agatha let her eyes close, she didn’t fight it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>When Agatha woke, it was to the sound of hushed voices.</p><p>She kept her eyes closed at first, not ready to let the light in, letting herself orient by sound alone. The room felt calmer than before. Quieter. The chaos had moved on without her.</p><p>“Just… please let her rest a little longer,” Rio murmured nearby. “She’s been through enough.”</p><p>“Rio,” Natasha said gently. “She needs to know.”</p><p><em>Needs to know what?</em></p><p>Agatha’s throat felt dry as sandpaper when she spoke. “Needs to know… what?”</p><p>Her voice came out rough, the effort of it pulling sharply at her side as she tried to sit up. She hissed under her breath, immediately regretting it.</p><p>Rio was there instantly, hands steady as she helped ease Agatha back into a better position. “Easy, carino,” she murmured.</p><p>Agatha lifted a hand, palm out, insisting she was fine despite the grimace she couldn’t quite hide.</p><p>Only then did she open her eyes.</p><p>Natasha and Wanda stood in the doorway. Their expressions were somber, heavy with the kind of news Agatha had delivered herself far too many times.</p><p>Her stomach sank.</p><p>“Debbie Jenkins passed away this morning,” Natasha said quietly.</p><p>The words settled into the room, final and irrevocable.</p><p>Agatha went still.</p><p>“Oh,” she said quietly.</p><p>It was the most she had in her.</p><p>Rio’s hand tightened around hers. Agatha didn’t look at her yet. She could already feel the guilt forming, familiar and sharp, even before it found language.</p><p>“She wasn’t alone,” Wanda said gently. “Gabby was asleep beside her.”</p><p>That landed harder.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes briefly. Catalogued the sensations out of habit—the hollow behind her ribs, the weight pressing down on her chest, the sharp pull of responsibility. She had intervened. She had delayed social services. She had hoped.</p><p>Hope was dangerous.</p><p>“When?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Just after sunrise,” Natasha replied. “She went peacefully.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once. Accepted it. Peacefully was as much mercy as this world ever allowed.</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“And Gabby?” she asked, already bracing.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught. “She’s with child services for now. Temporary. They said she was very quiet.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed.</p><p>“She asked for you,” Rio added softly. “Both of us.”</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest tightened painfully.</p><p>“I need to see her,” Agatha said.</p><p>Natasha hesitated. “Agatha—”</p><p>“I need to,” she repeated, steady now. Not as a surgeon. Not as a doctor. As something else entirely.</p><p>Rio met her eyes. She didn’t argue. Just nodded. “We will.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back against the pillow, exhaustion pressing in again, heavier than before. Her gaze drifted, unfocused, until it caught on something small taped to the wall across from her bed.</p><p>A crooked paper snowflake. </p><p>A handwritten sign that read Merry Christmas in uneven marker.</p><p>Morning light filtered weakly through the window. <br/>Christmas morning.<br/>Agatha closed her eyes.</p><p>And she hated Christmas again.</p><p> </p>

<p>Agatha’s usual instinct in moments like this was to disappear into work. To stay busy. To keep moving until the weight of it all dulled enough to be manageable.</p><p>With the current situation, she was unable to run. </p><p>When the police arrived, they seemed to sense the heaviness in the room immediately, the grief that hadn’t yet settled but hung thick in the air. They approached carefully, keeping their voices low and notebooks already in hand.</p><p>“Miss Harkness,” one of them began, measured and formal. “I’m very sorry for the loss of your mother, Evanora Har—”</p><p>He didn’t get any further.</p><p>“That fucking cunt was <strong><em>not</em></strong> my mother,” Agatha snapped, the words cutting sharp and fast. “Dont waste your breath on condolences.”</p><p>The room went still.</p><p>Even Agatha was faintly surprised by the venom in her own voice but she didn’t take it back.</p><p>Some losses deserved mourning. Others didn’t.</p><p>By the time the officers finally left, offering a slightly too cheerful “Merry Christmas” on their way out, Agatha had reached the end of her patience.</p><p>“I need to get out of here,” she said flatly.</p><p>Before Rio could react, she tore the IV from her arm and swung her legs over the side of the bed. Pain flared immediately as the stitches pulled, sharp and punishing, and she sucked in a breath through her teeth.</p><p>Rio went pale. Her hands came up, hovering in front of her, caught between the instinct to stop Agatha and the fear of making things worse.</p><p>“Mi amor,” she said carefully, forcing calm into her voice. “Slow down. You’re still recovering.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Agatha snapped. “I’m a doctor. I don’t need help.”</p><p>“Agatha, stop!”<br/>Rio’s voice cut through the room, echoing off the walls.</p><p>Agatha froze instantly, one foot barely touching the floor, her breath catching in her chest. The pain in her side throbbed, her body reminding her all at once that she was injured, that she was tired, that she was not as steady as she wanted to be. For a split second, embarrassment flared hot and defensive, followed quickly by something more uncomfortable. Fear. Not of the injury, but of what would happen if she stopped moving and let everything catch up to her.</p><p>“You are not running from this,” Rio said, her voice lower now but no less firm. “You will lie back down and rest until Jen says you are cleared to go home.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. Every instinct she had was screaming to push back, to reclaim control, to insist she was fine because that had always been safer than admitting she was not. If she kept moving, she would not have to feel the weight of Debbie’s death, or relive the events of last night.</p><p>She turned to look at Rio.</p><p>The trembling woman who had cried into her shoulder hours ago was gone. In her place stood someone solid and immovable, grief sharpened into resolve. Rio’s jaw was set, her eyes dark with determination and love, the kind that did not bend simply because Agatha wanted to disappear into motion.</p><p>“Please,” Rio said softly. “I know you’re upset, but you nee— <em>I</em> need you to rest.”</p><p>The last part came out barely above a whisper, like she was afraid asking too much might break something between them.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, the familiar urge to argue rising automatically. To insist she was fine. To insist she could keep going.</p><p>Instead, she sat back against the bed.</p><p>“Fine,” she said quietly. “But only because it’s you.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curved into a sad, relieved smile. “Thank you.”</p><p>Only then did Agatha really look at her.</p><p>Rio looked exhausted in a way that went beyond physical fatigue. Her shoulders sagged now that the adrenaline had drained away. There were dark shadows beneath her eyes and her movements slower, less precise. It dawned on Agatha that Rio probably had not slept at all. Had been running on fear and love and stubborn determination for hours.</p><p>Rio pulled the chair closer again and sat, her hand returning to Agatha’s like it belonged there.</p><p>For a while, neither of them spoke. The room was quiet except for the steady beeping of a monitor and the distant sounds of a hospital settling into early morning.</p><p>Eventually, Rio’s grip loosened.</p><p>Her breathing evened out, deepened. Her head tipped forward slightly, then back, mouth falling open as sleep claimed her without ceremony. A soft snore escaped her, barely audible but unmistakable.</p><p>Agatha blinked, then smiled despite herself.</p><p>She turned her head to look at Rio properly, fondness swelling in her chest. This was new. Not being alone with her thoughts. Not spiralling unchecked. Rio was here now, anchoring her without even trying, simply by existing in the same space.</p><p>Life was different because of<em> her</em>.</p><p>Safer. Fuller. Harder in ways Agatha had never expected, because now there was someone who could pull her back from the edge.</p><p>But the guilt still lingered.</p><p>It sat heavy and insistent beneath the warmth. Debbie’s face. The undiagnosed symptoms. The chart Agatha had read and reread. The nagging sense that something had been there, buried in lab values or progress notes, something she had missed.</p><p>She closed her eyes briefly, then opened them again.</p><p>Carefully, quietly, Agatha slid her hand from Rio’s slack fingers. Rio did not stir, only snored softly again, completely out now. Agatha eased herself to the edge of the bed, moving slowly to avoid pulling at her stitches. Pain flared, but she welcomed it. It kept her focused.</p><p>She stood, steadying herself, and glanced back once more.</p><p>Rio slept on, vulnerable and trusting, utterly unaware.</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightened.</p><p>“I’ll be right back,” she murmured, though Rio could not hear her.</p><p>Then she slipped out of the room, sock clad and determined, already turning over Debbie Jenkins’ case in her mind as she headed toward the room she no longer occupied.</p><p>Because if she had missed something, Agatha needed to know.</p><p>She moved through the corridors with practiced ease, keeping her head down and her steps measured. The hospital was quieter now and it was easy enough to slip by without drawing attention. Her side ached with every step, but she ignored it. </p><p>She reached the staff room without incident.</p><p>Inside, she changed quickly, peeling out of the torn, bloodstained scrubs and pulling on a clean set from her locker. The routine steadied her more than she cared to admit. When she turned, she spotted her white coat folded neatly over the back of a chair, exactly where someone must have left it for her.</p><p>Her phone was still in the pocket where she left it.</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet breath, slipped the coat on, and made her way towards where she knew she would be obsessing over medical notes for the next few hours.</p><p> </p><p><br/>When Rio woke and found Agatha gone, she didn’t panic.</p><p>She knew Agatha too well for that.</p><p>It was in her nature to look for answers, to chase certainty until her body or mind forced her to stop. Rest, for Agatha, only came after understanding. Rio also knew the guilt would be there already, heavy and insistent. The quiet belief that she should have seen something sooner. Done something differently. </p><p>Saved Debbie.</p><p>Rio checked her watch and frowned slightly. Nearly three hours had passed.</p><p>She sighed as she stood, muscles stiff from the cramped, barely padded chair. Stretching carefully, she rolled her shoulders and headed out into the corridor, already knowing where she would find Agatha.</p><p>The hospital was unusually quiet. Christmas morning had thinned the foot traffic, and the snowfall outside had kept most visitors away. The halls felt hushed, almost deserted.</p><p>When Rio reached the floor where Debbie’s room had been, she spotted Wanda standing near the door, peering through the small window with a worried expression.</p><p>Wanda noticed her immediately and offered a sad smile.</p><p>“I came to get you earlier,” she said softly. “But Agatha asked me not to wake you.”</p><p>Rio nodded, understanding.</p><p>She stepped closer and looked through the window, expecting to see Agatha bent over charts, searching relentlessly for something she might have missed.</p><p>Instead, Agatha stood with her back to them, utterly still, staring out at the snowfall beyond the glass. The white outside fell endlessly, quiet and indifferent.</p><p>“Jen already checked on her,” Wanda added. “She’s medically fine to be up and about. She’s just been standing there for about twenty minutes.”</p><p>Rio watched her for a moment longer, her chest tightening.</p><p>That, she realised, was worse.</p><p>Rio had never seen Agatha like this.</p><p>Agatha was always in motion, always doing, always finding something to fix or outrun. Stillness did not suit her. The only time Rio had ever seen her truly at ease was when they were tangled together in bed, the world kept at a distance by shared warmth and quiet.</p><p>This was different.</p><p>“We’re snowed in,” Wanda said softly behind her. “If you manage to get her to move, come by the nurses’ station.”</p><p>Wanda squeezed Rio’s arm gently, her gaze flicking once more through the window to where Agatha stood unmoving, before she turned and walked away.</p><p>Rio waited until Wanda disappeared down the corridor before pushing the door open.</p><p>It creaked softly, the sound barely noticeable over the low hum of the hospital. Agatha didn’t turn. She stood exactly where Rio had seen her through the window, arms folded across her chest, shoulders squared, gaze fixed on the slow, relentless fall of snow outside.</p><p>For a moment, Rio stayed by the door.</p><p>Then she crossed the room and stopped beside her.</p><p>She didn’t speak. She didn’t reach out. She simply stood there, close enough that their sleeves brushed, sharing the same quiet.</p><p>Minutes passed that way.</p><p>Agatha finally exhaled, long and slow, as if she’d been holding her breath without realising it.</p><p>“Is Wanda gone?,” she asked softly.</p><p>Rio nodded, even though Agatha wasn’t looking at her. </p><p>“You should have woke me up.” Rio said after a beat. </p><p>“I needed you to sleep,” Agatha answered. “At least one of us should.”</p><p>Rio shifted closer. “You don’t have to do this alone.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head then, just enough to look at Rio from the corner of her eye. There was no sharpness in her expression now. Just fatigue. And something heavier.</p><p>“I know,” she said.</p><p>Rio swallowed. “Agatha… you did everything you could. I know you did.”</p><p>Agatha nodded immediately without hesitation.</p><p>“I know,” she repeated.</p><p>Rio blinked, surprised. “You do?”</p><p>“Yes.” Agatha’s gaze returned to the window. “Because there was nothing else to do.”</p><p>Silence settled again, denser this time.</p><p>“I went through her chart,” Agatha continued calmly. “Every note. Every lab. I wasn’t missing anything obvious. It was always there, just buried. A constellation of things that looked manageable on their own.”</p><p>Rio listened, heart heavy, eyes fixed on Agatha’s profile.</p><p>“She had an undiagnosed cardiomyopathy,” Agatha said. “Subtle. No family history flagged. Her heart muscle was gradually weakening, but not enough to trip alarms. The shortness of breath, the fatigue, even the arrhythmias could all be explained away by stress, infection, pain.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed once.</p><p>“Then her electrolytes crashed overnight. Potassium dropped just enough, calcium followed. That was the trigger. It pushed an already fragile heart into a lethal rhythm.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened.</p><p>“By the time it declared itself, it was catastrophic,” Agatha went on. “No warning signs you’d catch in time. No intervention that would have changed the outcome. Even if she’d been on telemetry. Even if I had been standing right there.”</p><p>She finally turned to Rio then, eyes steady, certain.</p><p>“It was fast,” she said quietly. “And it was unavoidable.”</p><p>The words were steady. Certain. Final.</p><p>Rio let out a breath she hadn’t realised she’d been holding. Relief and grief tangled painfully in her chest.</p><p>Agatha finally turned fully toward her.</p><p>“I needed to know that,” she said. “Not just for me but for Gabby.”</p><p>Rio reached out then, resting her hand against Agatha’s arm. “You didn’t fail her.”</p><p>Agatha covered Rio’s hand with her own. “No,” she said softly. “She died. Those aren’t the same thing.”<br/>Rio leaned in, placing a soft kiss on Agatha’s shoulder, grounding them both.</p><p>“Come on, my love,” she murmured. “Let’s go home.”</p><p>Agatha let out a quiet scoff and gestured toward the window, where the snow continued to fall thick and unrelenting. “And how, exactly, do you propose we get home in <em>that</em>?”</p><p>Rio smiled, stepped closer, and wrapped her arms carefully around Agatha’s waist, mindful of the stitches. She buried her face briefly in Agatha’s hair, breathing her in.</p><p>“I can carry you,” she said simply. “I still have my snow boots on.”</p><p>That earned a soft, startled laugh from Agatha. She turned fully toward Rio, looping her arms around her shoulders, their foreheads brushing together.</p><p>“Show-off,” she murmured, the word fond, threaded with relief.</p><p>Rio’s grin turned mischievous.</p><p>Before Agatha could protest, Rio bent and carefully scooped her up, one arm firm beneath her knees, the other steady at her back.</p><p>“Rio!” Agatha yelped, laughter bubbling out of her as she instinctively clutched at Rio’s shoulders.</p><p>Rio smirked, rolling her tongue against her cheek like she was barely holding back a laugh. “Just doing my part to keep you off your feet, m’lady.”</p><p>Agatha shook her head, breathless and amused. “You’re a fool, Vidal.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio said easily, adjusting her grip, eyes warm. “But I’m your fool.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile softened.</p><p>She leaned in, careful of her side, and kissed Rio gently. It was unhurried and sweet, a quiet promise wrapped in warmth, before the heaviness of the day seeped back in.</p><p>Rio carried Agatha down the hall toward the nurses’ station like it was the most natural thing in the world, careful with her steps, unbothered by the attention they were drawing.</p><p>The nurses’ station was unusually lively. Jen, Alice, Wanda, Kate, and Natasha were all gathered around the desk, mid-laughter, the tension of the night before finally cracked just enough to let something lighter through.</p><p>They all looked up at once.</p><p>Jen’s eyebrow arched immediately, lips curling into a familiar smirk. “When I said limit movement,” she drawled, “this is <em>exactly</em> what I meant.”</p><p>Then she glanced at Alice. “Why don’t you ever lift me like that?”</p><p>The laughter came fast and loud.</p><p>Alice’s grin vanished as she looked from Jen to Rio, then down at herself, doing the math. She opened her mouth, shut it again, then huffed. “I’m not built for… whatever that is.”</p><p>Alice was at least a foot shorter than Jen, and while she was undeniably fit, the mental image of her attempting to hoist Jen bridal-style was absurd enough to make even Agatha snort.</p><p>Rio tightened her hold just slightly, grinning unabashedly. “For the record,” she said, “I offer this service selectively.”</p><p>“Isn’t your style more of an over-the-shoulder situation?” Kate said, tilting her head thoughtfully.</p><p>Wanda blinked. “What does that even mean?”</p><p>Kate grinned. “You know. Like—”</p><p>She didn’t finish the sentence. Instead, she stepped forward, hooked an arm around Alice’s legs, and hoisted her effortlessly over her shoulder.<br/>“—this.”</p><p>Kate grunted with the effort, adjusting her grip.</p><p>The room erupted.</p><p>“Dude, what the fuck?” Alice groaned, now upside down, hair hanging toward the floor. “Why is everyone picking on me today?”</p><p>Jen laughed so hard she had to grab the desk for support. Agatha wheezed against Rio’s shoulder, and Rio just shook her head, smiling like she’d walked into the best possible version of chaos.</p><p>Kate patted Alice’s leg. “Purely educational.”</p><p>Rio eased Agatha down onto one of the chairs with exaggerated care, as if she were made of glass. Agatha barely had time to settle before Natasha leaned in, close enough that only she could hear.</p><p>“You should call Lilia,” Natasha murmured. “I told everyone to keep what happened last night quiet, but she’ll know something’s off. She always does.”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft sigh. She’d known this moment was coming. The missed calls had been sitting heavy in her pocket ever since she’d found her phone tucked safely in her coat, impossible to ignore forever.</p><p>“I know,” she said quietly.</p><p>Her gaze drifted back to the group, and despite herself, she smiled. Rio was now attempting something frankly unhinged, positioning herself between Wanda and Kate and testing the feasibility of lifting both of them at once, laughing as they protested.</p><p>Agatha shook her head fondly.</p><p>She nodded once to Natasha, then pulled her phone from her pocket and rose carefully, moving a few steps away to give herself some privacy. The laughter behind her followed, warm and alive, as she braced herself to make the call she’d been avoiding.</p><p>The call rang only once before Lilia’s voice came through the line.</p><p>“There you are, my girl,” she said warmly. “I was starting to worry. Are you all right?”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes briefly at the sound of her. In the background, she could hear Sharon asking who was on the phone, followed by Lilia’s gentle but unmistakable hush. The faint clink of glass gave it away. <br/>They had already started on the festive drinks.</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said. “I’m fine. I’m sorry I didn’t call sooner. Things have been a little… chaotic here.”</p><p>The pause on the other end was brief, but telling.</p><p>“Agatha,” Lilia said softly, the warmth sharpening into focus. “What happened, dear?”</p><p>Agatha took a steadying breath. There was no point easing into it. She told her everything. Evanora taking Gabby. The rooftop. The cold. Jimmy pulling the trigger… and Debbie.</p><p>She glossed over the stab wound, downplayed it deliberately, framing it as a superficial scratch rather than what it had been. She told herself it was kinder that way.</p><p>Even so, she could hear the change immediately. The background noise faded. The easy cadence of Lilia’s voice steadied, sobering as the weight of it all settled in. Agatha pictured her sitting down, glass set aside, listening with full attention now.</p><p>When Agatha finally finished, the line was quiet.</p><p>Too quiet.</p><p>And Agatha knew, with absolute certainty, that no matter how carefully she had edited the truth, Lilia had heard everything that mattered.</p><p>“Oh, Agatha,” Lilia said softly, the words wrapped in care. “I’m so sorry, sweetheart. Do you want me to come get you?”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for a moment, letting the warmth of the offer settle in her chest. It mattered, knowing she was wanted, that someone would drop everything to be there for her.</p><p>When she opened them again, her gaze found Rio.</p><p>She was moving through the nurses’ station with Wanda and Kate draped over her shoulders like trophies, laughing as the others doubled over, breathless with amusement. The sight was absurd and perfect all at once. Alive, loud…safe.</p><p>Agatha smiled, something soft and steady blooning in her chest.</p><p>Those were her people.<br/> And she was exactly where she was meant to be.</p><p>“No, thanks, Lils,” she said gently. “I’ll be all right.”</p><p>And for the first time, she knew it was true.</p><p>"Merry Christmas my girl"</p><p>"Merry Christmas mom."</p>

<p> </p><p>It had been five days since Debbie passed away, and Agatha had already returned to work.</p><p>She’d ignored Lilia’s concern. Sidestepped Rio’s protests. Slipped back into the familiar rhythm of the hospital like it was muscle memory, because standing still had never been her strength. Work was easier than grief. Easier than thinking too long about the things she couldn't fix.</p><p>Gabby had been returned to the same temporary foster placement she’d stayed in while Debbie was hospitalised, and Agatha had done her best to push thoughts of the little girl to the back of her mind. It was simple enough, in theory. The placement was safe. Vetted. One Agatha herself had reviewed while Debbie was still alive. </p><p>Gabby was cared for. Protected.</p><p>What more could she reasonably ask for?</p><p>What Agatha hadn’t anticipated was how hard it would be to watch Rio accept the same information.</p><p>When social services told them it would be best not to maintain contact for now, citing the trauma of the rooftop and the importance of letting Gabby “settle,” Rio had gone quiet in a way that felt worse than anger. She nodded. She listened. She agreed.</p><p>And then she sulked.</p><p>It wasn’t dramatic. Just a heaviness that followed her home. A sadness she didn’t bother trying to hide. Rio wore her heart openly, and the absence of Gabby had left a visible mark.</p><p>Agatha took the news hard too. She just swallowed it better.</p><p>Where Agatha buried the ache and kept moving, Rio carried it with her, every thought written plainly across her face. And watching that—watching Rio hurt over someone Agatha had tried so carefully not to think about—made it harder to pretend she’d left it all behind.</p><p>“I was thinking,” Wanda said lightly, leaning against the counter, “that we should all do the Witches’ Road for New Year’s. Now that you’re feeling better.”</p><p>Agatha barely looked up. She was hunched over a chart, pen moving steadily, chewing at her lip as she made another note in the margin.</p><p>“Nothing wild,” Wanda continued, undeterred. “Just a couple of drinks. Watch the ball drop. Pretend we’re normal people for a night.”</p><p>“Yeah, sure,” Agatha said absently.</p><p>Wanda paused.</p><p>She tilted her head, studying Agatha for a beat. “Wow. Careful. Your enthusiasm might knock someone over.”</p><p>Agatha blinked, realising too late that she’d answered on autopilot. She capped the pen and slid the chart back into the pile on the counter, forcing her shoulders to relax.</p><p>“Sorry,” she said, managing a small smile. “That actually does sound like fun. I think I could use the change of scenery to be honest.”</p><p>Wanda lifted an eyebrow, studying her. “Okay,” she said carefully. “What’s wrong?”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, the sound quiet but heavy. “I can’t stop thinking about her,” she admitted. “That little girl. Debbie was her whole world. And now…” She trailed off, jaw tightening. “Now she doesn’t have anyone.”</p><p>Wanda nodded slowly. “Didn’t she get placed with that foster family in Eastview? The one you found before Debbie passed?”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said. “But that was only meant to be temporary. Just until Debbie recovered.” She shook her head. “Now she’s there while they look for something more permanent, and I don’t have any say in where she ends up. No influence. No oversight.”</p><p>Wanda leaned back against the counter. “Have you asked about visiting her? Just to check in.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth twisted. “Social services think seeing me would bring too much of that night back for her. Too many associations.” A beat. “And maybe they’re right.”</p><p>She hesitated, fingers tapping once against the chart in front of her.</p><p>“But something’s bothering me,” she added quietly. “I can’t shake the feeling that there’s more to this. Not medically. Just… instinctively.”</p><p>Wanda watched her for a long moment. “You trust those instincts for a reason.”</p><p>Agatha let out a faint, humourless breath. “Yeah. And they’re rarely this loud unless they want something from me.”</p><p>Wanda softened. “Or someone.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond right away.</p><p>Jen appeared behind Agatha just in time to catch the tail end of the conversation.</p><p>“Well, hello, lesbians,” she said brightly. “What petty gossip are we sharing today without me?”</p><p>Agatha shot her a withering look, then scoffed and turned on her heel, stalking off down the corridor without a word.</p><p>Behind her, Jen’s voice followed, genuinely confused. “What? What did I say?”</p><p>Wanda winced and shook her head. “Jen.”</p><p>“What?” Jen repeated, baffled. “That was inclusive.”</p><p>As Agatha rounded the corner into the emergency department, she scanned the board out of habit. Nothing critical. Teen was already helping a patient who’d slipped on the ice, demonstrating how to properly test weight-bearing with earnest concentration. The snow had finally begun to recede over the past few days, but black ice still plauged the sidewalks, catching people out when they least expected it.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness,” Yelena said, appearing at her side. “There’s a woman in reception asking to see you.”</p><p>Agatha frowned slightly. “Me? What’s wrong with her?”</p><p>“Other than the blue eyeshadow?” Yelena replied dryly. “Nothing obvious.”</p><p>She smirked and walked off before Agatha could ask another question.</p><p>Agatha huffed out a quiet laugh. Blue eyeshadow <em>was</em> a crime. Unless you were a clown. Or performing in community theatre.</p><p>As she approached reception, she spotted the woman immediately. Elderly, neatly dressed, with just enough pale blue eyeshadow to suggest effort rather than confidence. She was chewing her lip, hands folded tightly in front of her, posture tense with nerves.</p><p>Agatha softened her approach.</p><p>“I’m Dr. Harkness,” she said gently. “How can I help you?”</p><p>The woman looked up, relief flooding her features. “Oh, Dr. Harkness, thank you for seeing me. I know you must be terribly busy, being a doctor and all—”</p><p>Agatha waited, eyebrow lifting slightly when the rambling continued without direction.</p><p>“Oh—sorry,” the woman said quickly. “My name is Susan. My husband and I are fostering Gabriella Jenkins. Her mother was—”</p><p>“Is everything okay?” Agatha cut in, her pulse spiking. “Is Gabby all right?”</p><p>Susan’s eyes widened. “Oh goodness, yes. She’s fine. Physically, at least.” She hesitated, then sighed. </p><p>“I’m actually here because, well,  she keeps asking about you.”</p><p>Agatha went very still.</p><p>“She cries for her mother,” Susan continued softly. “All the time. But she also says she misses you. And someone named Rio.” She gave a small, apologetic smile. “I knew Debbie was a patient here, and I thought… this seemed like the best place to start looking for a Dr. Harkness.”</p><p>The noise of the department seemed to fade around them.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, her chest tightening as Gabby’s face flashed in her mind. “She’s been asking for us?” she asked quietly.</p><p>Susan nodded. “Every day.”</p><p>And suddenly, the quiet nagging feeling Agatha had been carrying all week had a name.</p><p>“Yes,” she said quietly. “She knows us.”</p><p>Susan nodded, relief and worry tangled together in her expression. “That’s what I thought. She talks about you like you’re… safe.” She hesitated. “I wasn’t sure if that was appropriate, but she’s three. She doesn’t really understand why some people disappear and others don’t.”</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes for half a second, steadying herself. When she opened them again, her voice was controlled, professional, but there was something raw underneath it.</p><p>“Has she been having nightmares?” she asked.</p><p>Susan blinked, surprised. “Yes. She wakes up crying most nights.”</p><p>“And does she settle when someone stays with her?” Agatha continued.</p><p>“Yes,” Susan said slowly. “If I sit with her. Or if I tell her stories.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. That tracked. Gabby had usually needed presence more than words.</p><p>“I’m not here to cause trouble,” Susan added quickly. “Social services advised against contact, and I understand that. Truly. But I didn’t feel right ignoring her when she keeps asking. She asked me this morning if you were both mad at her.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>“No,” she said immediately, a note of fierceness slipping through. “Absolutely not.”</p><p>Susan’s shoulders eased a little. “I thought you might say that.”</p><p>Agatha glanced toward the emergency bay, then back at Susan. “Did you come alone?”</p><p>“Yes. My husband is with her.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once, decision crystallising even as her heart raced. “Okay. Thank you for coming to me. That was the right thing to do.”</p><p>Susan studied her carefully. “I don’t want to overstep. I just… I think she needs continuity. Something familiar.”</p><p>“So do I,” Agatha said before she could stop herself.</p><p>A beat passed. Then Susan smiled, small and hopeful and handed Agatha a piece of paper with an Eastview address scribbled down.</p><p> “I think that would mean the world to her if you both came to visit.”</p><p>Agatha reached for the piece of paper then pulled out her phone from her pocket, fingers already moving on instinct.</p><p>“I'll arrange it with Rio now. And Susan?” she added.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Please tell Gabby that we both asked about her.” Her voice gentled despite herself. “And that she hasn’t been forgotten.”</p><p>Susan nodded, visibly moved. “I will.”</p><p>As she turned to leave, Agatha stood there for a moment longer, the noise of the emergency department rushing back in around her. Then she lifted the phone to her ear and made the one call she’d been trying not to make all week.</p><p>Rio answered on the second ring.</p><p>“Hey,” she said softly.</p><p>Agatha closed her eyes. “She’s been asking for us.”</p><p>The line went quiet.</p><p>Then Rio sucked in a sharp breath. She didn't need to ask who Agatha was referring to. “Is she okay?” she asked immediately. “What happened?”</p><p>The worry in her voice was unmistakable. They’d both been careful lately, skirting around Gabby’s name like it might shatter something fragile if spoken too often.</p><p>Agatha didn’t waste time. She told her about Susan. About the visit. About the way Gabby kept asking for them, how she cried for her mother but still looked for familiar faces.</p><p>“She misses us. I knew that fucking social worker was wrong, I had a gut feeling all week, I should have told her to go fuck herself.”</p><p>“Im sure they had their reasons.” Rio said, not unkindly.</p><p>A beat passed.</p><p>“So what do we do?” Rio asked, grounding herself the way she always did.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “We go see her. Tonight. You’re still off at six, right?”</p><p>There was a pause. Then Rio tried, and failed, to sound casual. “Yeah! I mean—yes. That sounds good.”</p><p>Agatha smiled to herself as she ended the call, a quiet warmth settling in her chest. She was relieved at the thought of seeing Gabby again, but just as much at the sound of something lighter in Rio’s voice. Joy had crept back in, tentative but unmistakable, and it felt like a small victory.</p><p>By the time her shift finally ended, Agatha was practically sprinting out of the hospital. The cold hit her immediately, sharp and biting, and she had to steady herself when her heel skidded slightly on the icy tarmac on the way to her car.</p><p>She made it to the firehouse in record time.</p><p>The red engine was still parked neatly inside the bay, shutters half-lowered, and Agatha felt a flicker of relief. No late call-out. No delays.</p><p>She climbed out of her black Mercedes and followed the sound of voices upstairs to the living quarters.</p><p>The space looked exactly as she expected. Tony was sprawled across the couch, talking animatedly at Peter, who looked deeply unimpressed. Bucky and Steve were at the kitchen counter, cleaning up what was clearly the aftermath of dinner.</p><p>Steve noticed her first.</p><p>“Hey, Dr. Harkness,” he called easily. “Good to see you. How’re you feeling?”</p><p>Agatha smiled politely, opening her mouth to answer—<br/>“Doc,” Tony cut in, already vaulting over the back of the couch, “you’re officially a badass. Come on, let’s see the war wound.”</p><p>“Fuck off, Stark,” Agatha said flatly. “Don’t be a creep.”</p><p>She didn’t have to move.</p><p>Rio appeared at her side instantly, stepping just slightly in front of her, body angled in a way that made her intent clear. Protective. Unyielding. Agatha could swear she almost heard her girlfriend growl in the process.</p><p>Hot.</p><p>Tony froze, then lifted both hands in surrender. “Hey, hey. I’m just saying, Vidal—your girl’s a hero.”</p><p>Rio didn’t soften, but Agatha felt her relax a fraction beside her.</p><p>“Yes well,” Agatha said dryly. “I prefer to stay a hero who is fully clothed thanks.”</p><p>That earned a laugh from Steve and Bucky in the kitchen.</p><p>Rio turned to face her fully, the edge in her posture melting away the moment her eyes met Agatha’s. A soft smile spread across her face, the familiar one she always wore when long days finally ended and they found their way back to each other.</p><p>“You ready to go?” Rio asked quietly.</p><p>Agatha smiled in return, the noise of the room falling away until it felt like it was just the two of them. <br/>She nodded once, sure and unguarded, and lifted her hand to cup Rio’s cheek, thumb brushing gently along her jaw.</p><p>Rio had a way of doing that to her. Making the world smaller. Making everything else feel less urgent.<br/>For a moment, Agatha forgot about charts and foster placements and everything waiting beyond the doors.</p><p>She leaned in just enough to rest her forehead against Rio’s, breathing her in, grounding herself in the familiar warmth.</p><p>“More than ready,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>They were halfway to the door when Rio suddenly stopped. “Wait,” she said, already turning and jogging back into the firehouse.</p><p>Agatha watched, puzzled, as Rio disappeared and then reappeared moments later, something clutched carefully in her hands, her expression uncharacteristically shy.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught.</p><p>“Teddy?” she asked softly. “Where on earth did you get that?”</p><p>It was Gabby’s stuffed bear. The same one she’d dropped on the rooftop in the chaos, small and forgotten in the aftermath.</p><p>Rio shifted her weight. “Tony grabbed it that night,” she admitted. “I had it cleaned. I was going to bring it to her, but then they said we shouldn’t see her, so I…” She trailed off, rubbing the back of her neck.</p><p>Agatha felt her chest tighten. She could see it now, how deeply that week had settled into Rio’s heart, how the little girl had carved out a space there without either of them noticing.</p><p>“She’s going to be so happy to have him back,” Agatha said gently.</p><p>Rio smiled, hopeful and a little nervous, clutching the bear like it was something precious.</p><p>The drive to Eastview passed too quickly.</p><p>Agatha kept one hand steady on the wheel, eyes on the road, while the other part of her attention stayed fixed on Rio.</p><p>Rio hadn’t stopped fidgeting with the stuffed bear since they’d pulled out of the firehouse lot. She smoothed Teddy’s fur, adjusted the bow at his neck, then did it all over again, her grip tightening and loosening like she couldn’t quite get comfortable.</p><p>Agatha reached over at the next red light, leaving one hand on the wheel as she threaded her fingers through Rio’s. She squeezed gently, grounding, familiar.</p><p>“Hey,” she said softly. “Relax, baby. She’s going to be happy to see you.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, but the tension didn’t fully leave her shoulders. “What if she’s upset we took so long?” she asked quietly. “She’s so small, Agatha. She won’t understand why we weren’t there.”</p><p>Agatha glanced over at her, heart aching at the naked worry in her voice. “She understands more than you think,” she said. “And what she’ll understand most is that you came back.”</p><p>Rio swallowed. “I just keep thinking about her asking for us. About her waiting on us.”</p><p>Agatha squeezed her hand again. “And now she doesn’t have to.”</p><p>The light changed. Agatha pulled the car forward, the tires crunching softly over leftover ice as Eastview came into view. A modest neighbourhood. Warm porch lights. Decorations still hanging from gutters, half-forgotten but glowing.</p><p>They turned onto a quiet residential street and slowed.</p><p>Rio straightened in her seat, clutching Teddy to her chest like armour. Agatha felt her own nerves flare then, sharp and sudden. Seeing Gabby again meant letting herself feel everything she’d been holding at bay all week.</p><p>Agatha parked, cut the engine, and turned toward Rio.</p><p>“Whatever happens,” she said gently, lifting Rio’s chin so she had to meet her eyes, “we show up calm. We show up kind. That’s what she needs.”</p><p>Rio nodded, eyes shining. “Okay.”</p><p>They sat there for a moment longer, breathing in sync, before opening the doors and stepping out into the cold together.</p><p>And as Agatha locked the car, Teddy tucked carefully under Rio’s arm, she had the strangest, clearest thought-</p><p>Some moments don’t feel like beginnings until you’re already standing in them.</p>

<p>Agatha paused on the porch, drawing in a slow breath. She could feel Rio beside her, practically vibrating with nervous energy, which was oddly disarming. Rio was usually the calm one, the steady presence. </p><p>Seeing her wound this tight made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>She squeezed Rio’s hand, a quiet reassurance, then lifted her other hand and knocked.</p><p>The door opened almost immediately.</p><p>Susan stood there, looking more tired than Agatha remembered, the strain of the past few days etched into her face. Still, she smiled when she saw them, genuine and warm.</p><p>“Oh, Dr. Harkness,” she said. Her gaze flicked to Rio. “And you must be Rio.”</p><p>“Please,” Agatha said gently. “Call me Agatha. And yes—this is my partner, Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Susan’s smile softened further. “It’s lovely to meet you properly. Please, come in. You’ve actually picked a very good time.” She stepped aside, lowering her voice just a little. “She was asking about you both again, she got a little upset.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio exchanged a look, something unspoken passing between them, before following Susan inside.</p><p>The house was large but unmistakably lived in. Family photographs lined the walls, framed moments of holidays, graduations, children frozen mid-laugh. The air smelled faintly of something warm and familiar, like soup or baked bread.</p><p>It felt like a home.</p><p>As they stepped farther into the house, Agatha heard it first.</p><p>Soft sniffles. The uneven sound of someone trying, and failing, to be quiet about crying.</p><p>Susan led them into the living room, and the sight stopped Agatha cold.</p><p>Gabby was curled in on herself at one end of the couch, knees tucked up, arms wrapped tightly around a cushion like it was the only thing keeping her anchored. She looked impossibly small, smaller than Agatha remembered, swallowed by the furniture and the space around her.</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest cracked open.</p><p>For a split second, the room blurred and she wasn’t standing in a stranger’s living room anymore. She was a child again. Too quiet. Too aware. Sitting with the same tight, folded posture, trying to take up less space in a world that had already decided she was on her own.</p><p>Alone.</p><p> Scared.</p><p> Waiting for someone who might not come back.</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard, forcing herself to stay present.</p><p>Gabby heard them then. Her head lifted slowly, cautiously, like she wasn’t sure she wanted to see who had come in. Her eyes found the doorway, and then they widened when she noticed them.</p><p>Gabby froze.</p><p>She didn’t smile right away. She didn’t move. She just stared at them, as if afraid this might disappear if she blinked. Agatha felt Rio inhale sharply beside her, felt the tension ripple through her body as she braced herself for rejection, for confusion, for anything that might hurt this child further.</p><p>Agatha didn’t step forward. She knew better than to rush a moment like this.</p><p>A heartbeat passed.</p><p>Then another.</p><p>Rio moved first.</p><p>She crouched down slowly, deliberately, bringing herself to Gabby’s level. She held out the stuffed bear in both hands, offering it like something sacred.</p><p>“He’s missed you, cariño,” Rio said softly.</p><p>That was all it took.</p><p>Gabby’s face crumpled and brightened all at once. She slid off the couch in a rush, padding across the room with sudden urgency. She snatched Teddy from Rio’s hands and flung her arms around Rio’s neck with all the force her small body could muster.</p><p>Rio caught her instantly, steady and sure, one hand supporting her back, the other cradling her head as Gabby pressed her tear-streaked face into Rio’s shoulder.</p><p>Agatha felt tears sting her eyes before she could stop them.</p><p>She turned her head slightly, breathing through it, overwhelmed by the sight of Gabby clinging to Rio like she’d been holding that hug inside her all week. By the sound of Gabby’s small sobs easing into hiccupped breaths, Agatha knew this was something she’d needed far more than words.</p><p>Susan seemed to sense the intimacy in the moment, her eyes also glassing over as she pressed a hand to her chest. Rio was still crouched on the floor, Gabby wrapped around her like she might disappear if she loosened her grip, and Susan looked at the three of them like she’d accidentally stepped into something sacred.</p><p>“I’ll give you three a moment,” Susan said softly. “Can I get you something to drink? Tea, coffee?”</p><p>Agatha sniffed, not wanting to give away that she too was overwhelmed by the scene unfolding in front of her. She glanced briefly at Rio, at the way her arms were wrapped securely around Gabby, her chin resting protectively atop the child’s curls.</p><p>“Two teas would be lovely.”</p><p>Susan smiled, wiping at her eyes as she moved through to the kitchen, giving them space without needing to be asked twice.</p><p>Agatha crouched down level with Rio and Gabby, her movements slow and careful, like she was approaching something fragile. Her hand came up to smooth the curls on the little girl’s head, fingers brushing briefly against Rio’s wrist in the process. Rio glanced up at her, eyes shining, and shifted just enough to make room for Agatha beside them.</p><p>“We’re so happy to see you, Gabby. We missed you very much,” Agatha said, her voice breaking just slightly despite her efforts to keep it steady.</p><p>Rio nodded along, murmuring softly, “So, so much,” her thumb rubbing small, soothing circles into Gabby’s back.</p><p>Gabby pulled her face from Rio’s neck and turned to look at Agatha, still clutching Teddy tightly in one hand. Rio kept an arm around her, anchoring, present, letting Gabby choose where to lean.</p><p>“Susie says mommy went to heaven and I can’t see her anymore,” Gabby said in as serious a voice as a three-year-old could manage.</p><p>Agatha felt the words settle heavy in her chest and wondered, briefly and painfully, how much of that statement Gabby actually understood. How much was just repetition, and how much was already grief taking root.</p><p>Rio inhaled softly beside her, steady but tight, her hand finding Agatha’s knee for just a second, grounding them both.</p><p>“But she said Doctor Haknest and Rio didn’t… but you couldn’t come see me. But you’re here.”<br/>
Agatha’s heart clenched.</p><p>“Yes, sweetheart, we are right here. We’re not going anywhere,” Agatha said, her voice gentle but certain, as she twirled one of Gabby’s curls around her finger. She felt Rio’s hand slide over hers then, covering it, reinforcing the promise without a word.</p><p>Rio gave the girl a small squeeze. “We’re here now,” she added softly. “And we’re really glad to see you.”</p><p>Agatha kept her expression calm for Gabby’s sake, but somewhere deep inside, she was mentally murdering the social worker who had decided absence was the kinder option. Some children didn’t need distance. They needed continuity. Familiar faces. Faces that stayed.</p><p>For the next hour, Gabby came back to life.</p><p>Agatha watched from the edge of the room as Rio settled onto the floor with her, sneakers kicked aside, jacket forgotten. Gabby dragged toy after toy over, narrating each one with solemn importance. Rio listened like every detail mattered, asking questions, letting Gabby correct her, laughing when the rules changed halfway through the game.</p><p>Every so often, Rio would glance up and catch Agatha watching.</p><p>She’d smile softly, that familiar warmth returning to her eyes, the kind Agatha hadn’t seen all week. The tightness in Rio’s shoulders had eased. Her laughter came easier now. Seeing it loosened something in Agatha’s chest she hadn’t realised she’d been holding closed.</p><p>This, she thought, was what they both had needed just as much as Gabby did.</p><p>Susan excused herself partway through the visit, murmuring something about a phone call. Agatha barely noticed at first, too absorbed in the sight of Gabby curled happily against Rio’s side, chattering about Teddy like he’d been on a long journey of his own.</p><p>When Susan returned, something was off.</p><p>Her smile didn’t quite reach her eyes, and she hovered near the doorway for a moment before approaching Agatha. Agatha stood immediately, instincts flaring.</p><p>“Is everything all right?” she asked quietly.</p><p>Susan lowered her voice, careful. “That was Geraldine. Gabby's social worker.” She hesitated. “She said they’ve been trying to reach Deborah’s parents. To inform them about… the situation.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>“She said they’re coming for the funeral,” Susan continued, glancing toward the living room where Gabby was laughing softly. “And they’d like to meet Gabby.”</p><p>Agatha felt the shift immediately, like a cold draft through an otherwise warm room.</p><p>She forced her expression into something neutral, professional, schooling her features the way she’d learned to do long ago. Inside, anger sparked sharp and immediate.</p><p>Debbie had told her about them. The way her parents had turned their backs the moment they found out she was pregnant. The silence that followed. The years of absence. Where had they been when Debbie was exhausted and scared and sick? Where were they when she was alive?</p><p>And now, suddenly, they wanted to meet Gabby.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze drifted back to the living room, to Gabby leaning into Rio’s side, safe and laughing, unaware of the complication quietly approaching her small world.</p><p>Once gabby had tired, Susan thanked them both for visiting and they promised Gabby they would come back again soon.</p><p>As they got into the car, Agatha immediately felt the change in Rio.</p><p>The tension she’d carried all week had melted away, replaced by an easy lightness that showed in the way she buckled her seatbelt and leaned back with a quiet, satisfied sigh. The visit had done something to her. Given her back a piece of herself Agatha hadn’t even realised was missing.</p><p>Agatha felt it too, but hers came with restraint.</p><p>She kept her eyes on the road as she pulled away from the curb, Susan’s words echoing faintly in the back of her mind. Gabby’s grandparents. The funeral. The request to meet. The conversation she knew was coming.</p><p>She didn’t say any of it.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Rio deserved this moment. The uncomplicated joy of knowing Gabby was safe, that she still remembered them, that the bond hadn’t been imagined. Agatha swallowed the words and let the quiet stretch, choosing instead to listen to Rio hum softly to herself, content in a way she hadn’t been all week.</p><p>The drive back passed quickly. By the time they reached Rio’s apartment building, night had settled in fully, the town quieter than usual.</p><p>Inside, the apartment was empty.</p><p>No familiar voices. No sign of Alice or Jen. The space felt unusually still.</p><p>Agatha realised, a little absently, that she hadn’t even checked the schedule earlier that day. Hadn’t noticed who was working late or staying elsewhere. She’d been too consumed with the anticipation of seeing Gabby again to think about anything beyond the visit.</p><p>Rio toed off her boots and glanced around, smiling. “Guess it’s just us.”</p><p>Agatha watched her for a moment, the quiet settling between them, the unspoken weight of everything waiting to be said pressing softly at the edges.</p><p><em>Just us</em>, she thought.</p><p>The quiet felt heavier now, thick with everything they had been holding back all day. Rio was still standing there, jacket half on, eyes bright and a little unsteady, like she didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.</p><p>Agatha crossed the room without saying a word.</p><p>She took Rio’s face in both hands, thumbs brushing warm against her cheeks. “Hey,” she murmured. “Look at me.”</p><p>Rio did. Her breath caught.</p><p>“You’re shaking,” Agatha said softly.</p><p>“I know,” Rio whispered. “I just… today. Seeing her. Thinking we weren’t allowed to. Thinking I might never—”</p><p>Agatha didn’t let her finish.</p><p>She kissed her.</p><p>It wasn’t tentative. It wasn’t careful. It was full and deep and desperate in the way only relief could be. Rio made a small sound of surprise before melting into it, hands grabbing at Agatha’s sweater like she needed something solid to hold onto.</p><p>Agatha pulled her closer, careful of her side but not gentle in the way that held back. This was a kiss meant to say <em>you’re here, I’m here, we made it</em>.</p><p>When they broke apart, Rio was breathing hard, forehead resting against Agatha’s.</p><p>“Hmm, what was that for?” she murmured, half laughing, half wrecked.</p><p>Agatha smiled, eyes dark and warm. “You needed it.”</p><p>“So did you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t deny it. Rio had been more than careful around her while she was healing, afraid that she would hurt her.</p><p>She leaned in again, slower this time, kissing her with a heat that lingered. Rio’s hands slid to Agatha’s back, pressing her closer, like she was afraid any space between them might let the fear creep back in.</p><p>They moved together without thinking, backing toward the couch, bumping into it awkwardly before sinking down in a tangled heap of limbs and soft laughter. Rio ended up half in Agatha’s lap, their faces still close, breath mingling.</p><p>The kiss finally slowed, though neither of them really pulled away. Rio stayed close, hands still gripping Agatha’s sweater, forehead resting against hers as she tried to catch her breath.</p><p>“You know what the worst part of this week was?” Rio murmured.</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly. “The part where I got stabbed?”</p><p>Rio snorted softly. “That was a strong contender. But no.” She hesitated, cheeks warming just a little. “It was trying not to touch you.”</p><p>Agatha lifted a brow, amused. “Excuse me?”</p><p>“I’m serious,” Rio said, laughing quietly. “Every time I saw you, all patched up and stubborn and pretending you were fine, I had to physically remind myself you were healing and not… available.” She shook her head. “It was torture.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile turned slow and dangerous. “Poor you.”</p><p>“You have no idea,” Rio said. “You kept looking at me like you always do. And I couldn’t even pull you close without worrying I’d hurt you.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands slid to Rio’s waist, warm and steady. “You could have still touched me baby.”</p><p>“Not like I wanted to,” Rio admitted, eyes dark with something affectionate and hungry all at once.</p><p>Agatha leaned in, brushing her nose against Rio’s. “Well,” she murmured, “I’m cleared for light activity.”</p><p>Rio’s laugh came out low and breathless. “Doctor, you’re very bad for my health.”</p><p>“Well then” Agatha said softly, kissing her again, “I think you deserve a reward for your resilience.”</p><p>Rio kissed her like she had been waiting all week for permission.</p><p>Agatha broke the kiss, trailing her lips along Rio’s jaw. Then down to her throat, pressing kisses to her skin, feeling the thrum of Rio’s pulse beneath her lips.</p><p>She could hear the soft sounds Rio was making, the quiet breaths, the whispered moans, and she could feel her chest rising and falling, faster and faster, and it made Agatha want more, want to give her more.</p><p>Agatha wanted to memorise this, every single second, every touch, every sound, every breath.</p><p>She slid her hand down Rio’s toned stomach, her fingers dancing along her abs as she slipped her them under Rio’s sweater and pulled it up, breaking contact just long enough to pull it over Rio’s head.</p><p>Agatha dropped the sweater on the floor, her eyes flicking up to Rio’s, heat pooling in her core at the way Rio was looking at her. At the way she was waiting for her, her cheeks flushed, her lips parted and her eyes so dark.</p><p>Agatha reached out, her fingers brushing across the seam of Rio’s sports bra, sliding across the swell of her breast.</p><p>Then down, trailing across her ribs, her stomach, the small happy trail, down to the waistband of her sweatpants.</p><p>She hooked her finger under the elastic and tugged, and Rio lifted her hips, letting Agatha pull the fabric down.</p><p>Agatha dropped to her knees in front of her, pressing a kiss to Rio’s hipbone and then lower, following the edge of her boxers down her thigh and nipping lightly with her teeth..</p><p>Rio was breathing faster now, and Agatha looked up at her, watching her chest rise and fall, watching the way her lips were parted, the way she was looking down at Agatha like she wanted her just as much as Agatha wanted her.</p><p>Agatha pressed another kiss to the inside of Rio’s thigh, her fingers trailing up, her touch so light. Then she leaned in and pressed her mouth to her centre, still over the soft fabric of Rio’s underwear, and Rio made the softest sound, something between a moan and a whimper.</p><p>Agatha pulled at the fabric with her fingers, and Rio stepped out of them, her breath catching in her throat.</p><p>“I bet you’ve been so pent up all week baby, I hope you haven’t been a bad boy and done anything without me?” Agatha teased with a smirk.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “No mi amor,” she breathed. “Ive been good, so good.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed her again, this time without the fabric between them, and Rio’s fingers slid into her hair, her back arching, her breath leaving her lungs.</p><p> “ay dios mío.”</p><p>Agatha dragged her tongue up, parting Rio’s folds, circling her clit. She could feel Rio trembling under her touch, could hear every soft sound, every quiet moan, and it just made her want to do this more, give her more, make her feel everything Agatha wanted her to feel.</p><p>She looked up, watching Rio as she touched her, as she tasted her. And she felt that jolt of heat between her own thighs as she started to feel her own underwear become ruined. </p><p>She flicked her tongue across Rio’s clit and felt her gasp, felt her grip tighten in Agatha’s hair.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio breathed. Her voice was low, shaky.</p><p>Agatha did it again. And again. And again, circling her tongue, feeling Rio shake against her, feeling her arch into her touch.</p><p>Agatha slid her hands up Rio’s thighs, her fingers digging into her flesh, holding her where she wanted her, and then she slid one hand between Rio’s legs, her fingers dipping into her, just barely.</p><p>Rio moaned, her hips shifting, seeking more of her touch.</p><p>“Fuck,” she whispered.</p><p>Agatha crooked her finger, pressing up, and she felt Rio shake again. She did it once more, and then she pulled back just enough to look at Rio, to watch her, to see what she was doing to her.</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio gasped. </p><p>Agatha smiled hovering just above where Rio wanted her.</p><p>"Use your words baby."</p><p>"Please, mi vida, I need you inside."</p><p>Agatha leaned back in, licking up through her centre again, sucking her clit, and Rio cried out, her fingers twisting tighter in Agatha’s hair. Agatha then slid her fingers deeper, pressing up again, again, again, and Rio was shaking against her, her moans filling the room, her hips rocking into Agatha’s touch.</p><p>Agatha kept going, kept touching, kept tasting, and it was so good, so fucking good, to give Rio this, to feel her come undone, to feel her let go. Agatha kept her fingers moving, kept her tongue circling, until Rio cried out again, until she shook and trembled and came against Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>And then Agatha slowed, her touch growing softer, gentler, easing her through it until Rio went limp against the couch cushions.</p><p>“ Mierda,” she murmured. She sounded dazed.</p><p>Agatha pressed a kiss to the inside of her thigh and then climbed up to straddle Rio's hips, her hands coming to Rio’s cheeks.</p><p>She kissed her, soft and slow. “I love you” she whispered against her lips.</p><p>Rio opened her eyes slowly, her hand coming up to cup Agatha’s face.</p><p>“I love you too,” Rio said quietly. Then she shook her head, smiling a little, like she needed to say it better. “But not in a small way. Not in a careful way.”</p><p>She lifted her other hand, cupping Agatha’s face the way Agatha had done to her.</p><p>“I love you in the way that makes a place feel like home,” Rio continued softly. “In the way that makes everything before you feel like it was just leading me here. I love you in the way that means I’m not afraid of tomorrow anymore, because I get to face it with you.”</p><p>Her forehead rested against Agatha’s.</p><p>“So yeah,” she murmured, breath warm between them. “I love you. All of you. Always.”</p><p>Agatha felt it land somewhere deep and unguarded.</p><p>Not like a spark. Like a settling.</p><p>For a split second, her mind went blank, every sharp thought she usually reached for just… gone. All that was left was the weight of it. Of being seen. Chosen. Claimed without hesitation.</p><p><em>This is what safe feels like,</em> she realized, startled by the thought.</p><p>Her chest tightened, eyes burning, and she leaned into Rio without thinking, like her body knew before she did that this was where she belonged. Not bracing. Not waiting for the catch.</p><p>Just held.</p><p><em>Don’t lose this,</em> she thought fiercely.<br/>
<em>Don’t ever forget how this feels.</em></p>

<p>Agatha woke slowly, body heavy and warm, the kind of deep, lingering tired that came from being thoroughly undone the night before.</p><p>For a moment she lay still, eyes half-lidded, letting the memories surface in fragments. Rio’s hands, sure and insistent. The way her voice had softened when she said her name. The way everything had blurred into heat and laughter and breathless closeness until time stopped meaning anything at all.</p><p>Her muscles ached in a way that made her smile.</p><p>Not the sharp pain of injury or exhaustion, but the dull, intimate soreness that came from being worshipped. </p><p>She shifted slightly and felt it again, a reminder written into her body. Rio’s weight over her. Rio’s mouth on her skin. The way they had moved together like they were discovering something new and inevitable all at once.</p><p>Agatha turned her head and found Rio still asleep beside her.</p><p>She took a slow breath, eyes tracing the smooth line of muscle along Rio’s back and arms, the way strength sat so naturally in her body. Even at rest, Rio looked powerful, solid in a way that felt both grounding and impossibly attractive.</p><p>Agatha’s mind again, drifted back to the night before, to the way those same arms had held her, lifted her, shifted her with an ease that had left her breathless and laughing in equal measure. Rio had moved her like she was something precious, not fragile, guiding her with confidence and care, always checking in, always aware of every reaction.</p><p>It struck her then how much trust was wrapped up in that. Letting someone else take control. Letting herself be moved, held, wanted so openly.</p><p>She smiled softly to herself as reached out, barely brushing her fingers along Rio’s arm. It was enough to make her stir.</p><p>Honey-brown eyes blinked open, meeting blue.</p><p>“G’morning, princesa,” Rio murmured, voice thick with sleep and a lazy smile tugging at her mouth.</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes, but there was no real heat in it. “What did I say about calling me that?”</p><p>Rio’s smile only widened as she shifted closer, sliding an arm around Agatha and burying her face into the warm curve of her neck.</p><p>“Lo siento, mi reina.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, soft and helpless, like she’d forgotten how to be anything but this, and pushed at Rio’s shoulder in half-hearted protest.</p><p>“Much better,” Agatha murmured, smiling as she threaded her fingers through Rio’s hair. Rio was still nuzzling into her neck, lips brushing soft, lazy kisses along her throat.</p><p>“Mmm. As much as I’d love to stay in bed all day,” she said, “I promised Lilia I’d help with her New Year’s rituals.”</p><p>That made Rio finally pull back, brows knitting in confusion.</p><p>“Her… what?”</p><p>Agatha snorted quietly at the expression on her face. “Honey, you are aware Lilia’s a witch, right?” she said with exaggerated seriousness.</p><p>Rio blinked. “Well, yeah, but I thought it was more like a… kooky hobby?”</p><p>“Oh, she takes it very seriously. And I’m absolutely telling her you called her kooky.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened, properly alarmed now. “You wouldn’t dare.”</p><p>Agatha hummed as she rolled onto her back, hands laced behind her head. “Maybe she’ll turn you into a frog.”</p><p>“Well, lucky for me,” Rio grinned, leaning in, “I have a beautiful princess to kiss me and break the spell.”</p><p>Agatha stopped her with a finger to her lips, one eyebrow arching.</p><p>“Of course,” Rio corrected smoothly, smirk softening. “A queen.”</p><p>Agatha hummed contently as Rio kissed her. </p><p>They spent a little longer than planned tangled in the bedsheets, the morning stretching soft and unhurried around them.</p><p>Eventually, reality intruded in the form of sunlight creeping higher up the wall and the distant awareness of time ticking on without them. Rio groaned dramatically when Agatha finally rolled away to sit on the edge of the bed.</p><p>“You’re mean,” Rio said, rubbing her face into the pillow. “You lure me into happiness and then abandon me for witch duties.”</p><p>Agatha glanced back over her shoulder, already reaching for her clothes, lips curved in a fond smile. </p><p>“You’re coming with me.”</p><p>Rio peeked up at her. “I am?”</p><p>“Absolutely. If I have to endure Lilia’s incense and chanting, you can suffer too.”</p><p>Rio considered this, then flopped back onto the mattress. “Fine. But if I get hexed, I’m coming for you.”</p><p>Agatha leaned down to steal one last kiss, slow and lingering, before finally, reluctantly, pulling them both out of bed.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The drive to Lilia’s was filled with gentle touches. Agatha drove with one hand on the wheel, the other drifting across the console to rub Rio’s thigh absentmindedly, her thumb tracing slow, familiar circles. </p><p>Rio, half-turned in her seat, threaded her fingers through Agatha’s hair, lightly scratching at her scalp whenever she stopped at a red light.</p><p>It felt easy. Natural. Like something they’d been doing for years instead of months.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t remember the last time she’d felt this carefree, this quietly happy, without the usual edge of tension sitting beneath it. For once, she wasn’t bracing herself for loss or waiting for something to fracture. She was just… here, in a car, being touched by someone who loved her.</p><p>When they stepped into the familiar home she shared with Lilia, she was immediately met with the strong, earthy scent of sage and frankincense, smoke lingering in the air like a memory.</p><p>Beside her, she noticed the subtle scrunch of Rio’s nose, the way she bit her lip to suppress a smile—trying very hard to be respectful, and failing in the most endearing way.</p><p>“Oh, there are my girls,” Lilia said warmly as she opened the door, already ushering them inside. “Have you eaten yet? No, of course you haven’t. Sit down, I’ll make you both some pasta.”</p><p>They barely had time to protest before they were being herded into the kitchen. Ebony appeared almost instantly, slipping soundlessly from the hallway like a shadow, her black tail flicking once before she made a beeline straight for Agatha. She wound herself around Agatha’s ankles with clear purpose, brushing insistently until Agatha sighed and bent to scoop her up.</p><p>Agatha and Rio shuffled in together, Agatha balancing the cat easily on her hip as Ebony settled in like she belonged there, stealing soft touches and exchanging quiet laughs at Lilia’s frantic energy. Even once they sat at the table, Ebony claimed Agatha’s lap instantly, her paws kneading contentedly as their chairs were angled close, their hands finding each other under the edge without thinking.</p><p>Rio glanced around, eyebrows lifting slowly.</p><p>The kitchen looked like a cross between a witch’s apothecary and a Bath and Bodyworks—bundles of herbs hung from the cabinets, candles and soaps crowded every surface, tarot cards fanned across the table, and strangely… a lone bongo drum sat between a bowl of oranges and a stack of notebooks.</p><p>“…What’s all this, Lilia?” she asked.</p><p>Lilia, already filling a pot with water, replied without turning. “My coven and I are preparing for the New Year, of course.”</p><p>Rio straightened slightly. Agatha’s mouth twitched, sensing an oppertunity.</p><p>“Yes, Lilia,” Agatha said mildly, voice carrying a peculiar edge, “please do tell Rio what kind of rituals you’ll be doing tonight.”</p><p>Rio shot her a look, but missed the subtle wink Agatha threw Lilia as she finally turned around.</p><p>Lilia smiled sweetly—then carefully arranged her face into something deliberately casual. “Oh, just the usual. A few spells, a small sacrificial ceremony, and then right before midnight, we all strip naked and dance around the yard chanting our manifestations to the moon.”</p><p>Agatha deserved an award for how perfectly neutral she kept her expression.</p><p>Rio’s face, on the other hand, went through several stages—shock, horror, and finally deep suspicion.</p><p>“…You’re fucking with me, right?”</p><p>She looked between them, clearly waiting for one of them to crack.</p><p>“You girls should join us, Oh, Sharon’s bringing the animal bones again,” Lilia added offhandedly. “Last year she tried reading the future in a goat skull. Bit messy, but very accurate.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widened. “A goat skull?”</p><p>Her gaze flicked instinctively to Ebony, who was still curled comfortably in Agatha’s lap, utterly unbothered by the conversation. The cat merely blinked slow and languid, tail giving a lazy flick, as if animal bones were the least interesting thing she’d heard all day.</p><p>Lilia turned back to the stove, dropping the pasta into the boiling water like she hadn’t just said something unhinged. “You know what, you girls should come, we need someone for the possession.”</p><p>Rio’s face paled even more, “Possession?”</p><p>“Last year Sharon got a little carried away,” Lilia said thoughtfully. “Started speaking in tongues, and I swear I’ve seen her wandering the yard since at night, in a trance, just staring at her flowerbeds. So this year we’ll need someone else. Someone with a stronger spirit.”</p><p>Agatha nearly lost it.</p><p>She pushed back from the table and stood abruptly as Ebony leaped onto the floor, turning away from Rio just in time. She buried her face in the open fridge, shoulders shaking as she pretended to study the contents, laughter muffled by the hum of the appliance.</p><p>Before Rio could manage more than a strangled noise, the front door opened.</p><p>“Sorry I’m late, Lilia!” Sharon called brightly as she stepped inside, floral-print shirt cheerful as ever, grocery bag looped over her arm. “Traffic at Walgreens was a nightmare. I swear I could’ve cursed that checkout boy for moving so slow—”</p><p>She stopped short, spotting Rio.</p><p>“—Rio, dear, are you alright?”</p><p>Rio hadn’t blinked. Her face had gone chalk-white, eyes tracking Sharon’s every movement like she might start floating off the ground at any second.</p><p>That did it.</p><p>Agatha snorted loudly from inside the fridge, clapping a hand over her mouth as laughter finally broke free. Lilia followed suit immediately, her booming laugh filling the kitchen.</p><p>Sharon jumped, startled, looking between the three of them in utter confusion. “What did I miss?”</p><p>Rio dragged her hands down her face, breathing deeply, trying and failing not to laugh herself.</p><p>“Just these two,” she muttered, shooting Agatha and Lilia a glare softened by a smile, “being an absolute menace.”</p><p>Agatha crossed the room and cupped Rio’s face in both hands, squishing her cheeks just enough to draw out an exaggerated pout.</p><p>“I’m sorry, baby,” she said, utterly unapologetic. “It was too easy. You should’ve seen your face.”</p><p>She stole a quick kiss from Rio’s pursed lips before letting her go and turning to help Sharon unload the groceries.</p><p>Rio scowled after her. “You’re mean. And I expected better from <em>you</em>, Lilia. Now I see where Agatha gets it from.”</p><p>Lilia waved a dismissive hand. “You love me. Don’t lie.” She paused, then added casually, “Oh—and Dottie the realtor mentioned a couple of two- and three-bedroom places, like you asked. I wrote them down somewhere…”</p><p>She shuffled through a stack of papers before producing a small slip with a few addresses scribbled on it.</p><p>Agatha’s smile faded instantly.</p><p>Beside her, Rio’s spine went rigid.</p><p>“You’re moving?” Agatha asked quietly. “You didn’t say anything.”</p><p>Rio scratched the back of her neck, eyes flicking everywhere but Agatha. “I—uh. I was just… checking some stuff out.”</p><p>Lilia, sensing the shift, glanced between them. “Sharon, dear, why don’t you come help me finish up in the living room?”</p><p>Once they were alone, Rio turned back to Agatha, shoulders tense.</p><p>“After you called yesterday,” she said, voice lower now, more careful, “and said Gabby wanted to see us… I asked Lilia if she knew of anything available.”</p><p>She swallowed.</p><p>“I know it’s probably silly and might never happen, but I figured if Gabby ever wanted to you know, come stay with us, she’d need a place that didn’t feel like a college dorm. And—” her face flushed a deep red, “—if you… maybe wanted to live with me, we’d need our own space.”</p><p>Her gaze stayed fixed anywhere but on Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s throat tightened as she took in the sheepish look on Rio’s face. This incredible woman—already planning ahead, already thinking in what ifs—was considering how to care for a little girl who needed help. Who needed love.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t thought her heart had room for more, but somehow it made space anyway.</p><p>Then one thought pushed sharply to the front of her mind.</p><p>She hadn’t told Rio about Gabby’s grandparents. That they might take her. That this fragile hope could be temporary.</p><p>Her chest twisted with the weight of it. On one hand, Rio was offering to take on an orphaned child she’d bonded with. In the same breath, she was asking Agatha to move in—to build something together, to be part of that future.</p><p>And Agatha stood there, caught between the love being offered to her and the truth she was still holding back.</p><p>Just as Agatha opened her mouth to speak, her phone rang.</p><p>The sound shattering the moment entirely.</p><p>She glanced down at the screen—Westview General—and her chest sank even as her spine straightened out of habit. Duty sliding back into place.</p><p>She answered quickly, voice shifting without effort as she listened, asked two sharp questions, then closed her eyes briefly.</p><p>“I’m on my way,” she said, already reaching for her coat.</p><p>When she hung up, Rio was watching her with quiet understanding.</p><p>“Go,” Rio said softly. “I’ll meet you at the bar later?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, relief and regret tangling together. She leaned in, kissed Rio quickly but deeply, forehead resting against hers for a beat longer than necessary.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she murmured. “Try not to fall into any cauldrons while I’m gone.”</p><p>Rio huffed a laugh, squeezing her hand. “Oh, ha ha.”</p><p>Agatha smiled, just a little, before turning toward the door— promising herself she would tell Rio about Gabby’s grandparents tomorrow.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>When Agatha arrived at the hospital, Wanda was waiting for her, already apologetic as Agatha pulled her white coat from its hook and shrugged it over her purple sweater and dark jeans.</p><p>“I’m sorry to drag you in,” Wanda said quietly as they walked. “They insisted on speaking to you directly. Jen tried to give them as much information as she could, but they wouldn’t hear it. Kept saying they needed her doctor.”</p><p>Agatha scoffed under her breath. “Funny how they suddenly give a damn now that their daughter is dead.”</p><p>When Wanda had called earlier to explain that Debbie’s parents had shown up demanding answers, Agatha had forced her expression into something neutral in front of Rio. She hadn’t wanted to open that door without enough time to deal with the fallout. Part of her had also wanted to see them first. To look them in the eye.<br/> She had questions of her own.</p><p>“They seem… pretty upset,” Wanda offered carefully.</p><p>“I’ve seen plenty of crocodile tears,” Agatha replied flatly.</p><p>Wanda led her to the waiting room.</p><p>An older man and woman sat hunched together in a row of plastic chairs, hands clasped, shoulders bowed. They looked small, defeated. Everything a grieving parent should look like. </p><p>Agatha squared her shoulders and walked in, professionalism settling over her like armour, even as irritation simmered beneath it.</p><p>“Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins?” she said evenly. “I’m Dr. Harkness. I was Deborah’s physician while she was here at Westview General. I understand you have some questions about her passing.”</p><p>Mrs. Jenkins looked up first.</p><p>Agatha immediately noticed the signs—red-rimmed eyes, swollen lids, the deep, exhausted lines of someone who hadn’t slept. The grief on her face was raw, unpolished. Real.</p><p>It caught Agatha off guard.</p><p>“Thank you for seeing us,” Mrs. Jenkins said, voice unsteady. “My husband and I… we’re still in shock. You’ll have to forgive us. We just—we just want to understand what happened to our—”</p><p>Her voice broke, the word lodging painfully in her throat.</p><p>Mr. Jenkins reached for her hand, enveloping it in both of his, pressing a gentle kiss to her temple as tears slipped freely down his own face.</p><p>Mrs. Jenkins drew in a shaky breath, wiped at her cheeks, and straightened as best she could.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she said, clearing her throat. “She was our little girl. I just can’t believe she’s… she’s really gone.”</p><p>Agatha stood there, the practiced responses she’d prepared dissolving one by one.</p><p>This wasn’t the reaction she’d imagined. Not from the parents Debbie had told her about, the parents who had turned their backs when she needed them most.</p><p>Agatha drew a slow breath and began.</p><p>She explained Debbie’s symptoms as clearly as she could—how she’d come in short of breath, how he vitals had initially been stable, how the early imaging hadn’t shown anything that raised immediate alarm. She walked them through the tests that had been ordered, the labs that had been run, the treatments they’d started the moment Debbie was admitted.</p><p>She chose her words carefully. Not the clipped precision she used in consults, but something softer, steadier. She made space for pauses, for questions, for the way grief bent logic and time to most people experiencing it.</p><p>“The complication that caused her collapse was sudden,” Agatha said gently. “Rare. Even in hindsight, there were no warning signs that would’ve allowed us to predict it.”</p><p>Mrs. Jenkins pressed a hand to her mouth, nodding slowly as tears welled again. Mr. Jenkins asked questions in a low, measured voice about timelines, about protocols, about whether anything could have been done differently.</p><p>Agatha answered every one of them without defensiveness. She didn’t rush. She didn’t deflect. When there were uncertainties, she named them honestly. When there were limits, she acknowledged them.</p><p>“I’m so sorry,” she said, not as a formality, but as a fact. “We did everything we could for her.”</p><p>The room was quiet when she finished.</p><p>Mrs. Jenkins reached for a tissue, dabbing at her eyes. Mr. Jenkins squeezed her hand. There was grief there still—heavy and unmistakable—but the sharp edge of anger Agatha had braced for never came.</p><p>“I can see you cared for her,” Mrs. Jenkins said finally, voice hoarse. “She wasn’t alone, was she?”</p><p>Agatha shook her head. “No. She wasn’t.”</p><p>Something eased, just slightly, in the set of their shoulders. They exchanged a look—shared, silent—and then Mr. Jenkins nodded once.</p><p>“Thank you for explaining it to us,” he said. “We… we appreciate your honesty.”</p><p>Agatha inclined her head, professionalism holding, even as something complicated settled in her chest.</p><p>“Forgive me,” Agatha said carefully, “but when I asked Debbie if there was anyone we could contact, she told me her parents had cut off all communication. That you hadn’t approved of her pregnancy.”</p><p>Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins both looked up at that, confusion crossing their faces almost in unison.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness,” Mrs. Jenkins said quietly, shaking her head, “Debbie wasn’t estranged. She ran away.”</p><p>Mr. Jenkins tightened his grip on her hand as she continued.</p><p>“We’d been looking for her for almost six years. We didn’t know she was pregnant—we didn’t even know where she was. We argued when she was seventeen. She was going through a rebellious phase, and I found drugs in her pocket. I confronted her about it, and the next morning… she was gone.”</p><p>Her voice wavered, but she pressed on.</p><p>“We went to the police. They didn’t care. They treated her like just another junkie who’d chosen to disappear.” A sharp breath. “We searched for her every day. And now—now we finally have answers, and it’s… it’s too late.”</p><p>Agatha listened, something cold and heavy settling in her chest.</p><p>The grief in Mrs. Jenkins’s voice wasn’t performative or convenient. It was threaded through every word, every pause. This was a mother who had been missing her child for years—and had only just found her again in the worst possible way.</p><p>Shame crept in suddenly, sharp and unwelcome.</p><p>Agatha felt it settle heavy in her chest as she thought about the assumptions she had made, the judgments she had been so ready to pass on the two grieving parents sitting across from her. Guilt followed close behind, tangled with an instinct she had not wanted to examine. </p><p>“I’m very sorry for your loss,” Agatha said quietly as she stood and turned toward the door.</p><p>“Our granddaughter. Gabriella,” Mrs. Jenkins said, stopping her. “You’ve met her?”</p><p>Agatha paused.</p><p>She drew in a slow breath, her back still to them, eyes closing despite herself.</p><p>Images came unbidden.</p><p>Rio with Gabby perched on her shoulders.</p><p>Gabby holding out Teddy to Agatha with her dimpled cheeks and radiant smile. </p><p>The fragile, foolish fantasy of the three of them building something that looked like a future.</p><p>She opened her eyes and turned back.</p><p>“Yes,” she said, steadying her voice. “She is a beautiful, remarkable little girl. She lights up every room she’s in. She likes chocolate milk but not strawberry. Her favourite colour is yellow because she says it looks like the sun. And she needs to hold onto someone when she falls asleep. That part is important.”</p><p>She stopped to swallow the lump in her throat.</p><p>“I hope you take very good care of her.”</p><p>Agatha did not wait for a response. She turned and walked away before she could lose her composure, heading back toward the staff room with her breath tight in her chest.</p><p><em>It’s for the best. They can give her the life she deserves. They are her family.</em></p><p>“There you are,” Jen said as she came in, tossing her scrub cap into her locker. “I hope they didn’t give you too hard a time. Nat’s been sweating, convinced they were about to try some kind of negligence suit.”</p><p>She turned and took one look at Agatha’s face.</p><p>“Oh shit. They <em>did</em>?”</p><p>Agatha wiped at her cheeks, only then realising tears were falling. She huffed out a weak attempt at a laugh.</p><p>“No. Just… they weren’t what I was expecting.”</p><p>Jen frowned. “Douchebags?”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said quietly. “Decent people.”</p><p>Jen studied her. “Then why do you look like someone punched you in the stomach?”</p><p><em>Because that’s exactly what it feels like.</em></p>

<p>Agatha would never have called herself a style icon. She preferred clothes that were comfortable, practical, and quietly flattering. Things that signalled competence first, with just enough femininity to soften the edges. When Jen asked what she planned to wear to the bar that night, Agatha had described the maroon slacks and white silk button-up she owned, the one that skimmed her figure just enough to feel dressy without trying too hard.</p><p>Jen had scoffed.</p><p>“Predictable,” she’d said.<br/>Something about that had lodged under Agatha’s skin. Was she really that predictable?</p><p>“Well, at least you know Rio’s already in love with you,” Jen had added, not unkindly. “God knows why, but I’m sure she’s used to those outfits.”</p><p>That was what really got under her skin.</p><p>Because what if Rio had noticed? Not in a critical way, but in the quiet, observant way she noticed everything else. What if Rio had clocked how little effort Agatha made sometimes, how she’d never really dressed to be seen, only to be appropriate?</p><p>Agatha told herself it didn’t matter. Rio loved her. She’d said so. But the thought lingered anyway, sharp and uncomfortable. Love wasn’t supposed to mean complacency.</p><p>And so Agatha found herself standing in Jen’s apartment, tugging at hemlines and smoothing unfamiliar fabrics, trying on outfit after outfit that felt bold, revealing, almost unrecognisable. Each one a small rebellion against the version of herself that had learned to never ask for more attention than necessary.</p><p>She caught her reflection in the mirror and felt a strange mix of nerves and resolve, this was definitely …different but she didn’t hate it. </p><p>They had ultimately settled on what Jen called her “old faithful” little black dress.</p><p>It was fitted enough to trace the natural curve of Agatha’s hips, the shape she secretly admired in the mirror when no one was looking. The hem fell just above her knee, revealing a careful, deliberate amount of skin without tipping into anything excessive. The short sleeves skimmed her shoulders, leaving her pale, toned arms exposed in a way that felt both elegant and faintly daring.</p><p>It wasn’t outrageous.</p><p><br/>But it was intentional.</p><p>They hadn’t needed to do much to her hair. Jen worked in a few products, coaxing Agatha’s natural curls into something softer, fuller, letting them spill past her shoulders in glossy waves that felt effortless but undeniably styled.</p><p>“I am like fucking Michelangelo,” Jen declared as she finished applying a deep red lipstick, steady-handed and precise. She stepped back, eyeing her work critically. “Honestly, it’s annoying how good your skin is. You barely need makeup.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, but the faint flush in her cheeks betrayed her.</p><p>The final touch was a classic pair of black stiletto heels. Jen crouched to adjust the straps, then stood back slowly, arms crossed, taking in the full picture like a curator admiring a prized exhibit.</p><p>“Rio’s going to have a heart attack when you walk in there,” she said with satisfaction.</p><p>Agatha glanced at herself in the mirror again, this time lingering a little longer. The woman staring back at her looked polished, composed… but also softer somehow. There was a quiet confidence in the set of her shoulders, in the curve of her mouth.</p><p>“Hmm,” she said lightly, tilting her head. “I suppose this will do.”</p><p>Jen barked out a laugh. “Oh, admit it, Harkness. You look damn good and you know it.”</p><p>Agatha tried for indifference, but she couldn’t quite suppress the small, satisfied flicker in her chest. It wasn’t vanity. It was something closer to surprise. She wasn’t used to seeing herself framed like this—styled for desire instead of authority. It felt… vulnerable. But not in a bad way.</p><p>Her attention shifted when she turned and caught sight of Jen, who was mid-conversation and entirely unbothered by the fact that she was standing in nothing but her underwear. Jen gestured animatedly while stepping into a bright pink dress, chatting as if this were the most natural thing in the world.</p><p>“Zip me?” Jen said, turning her back without ceremony.</p><p>Agatha blinked once before stepping forward, fingers carefully pulling the zipper up along the smooth line of Jen’s spine.</p><p>It struck her then, how foreign this all felt.</p><p>She had never had this growing up. No sleepovers. No shared mirrors or whispered conversations about crushes. No easy laughter while getting ready for a night out. She had always chosen study over socialising, privacy over people. There hadn’t been time—or maybe she hadn’t allowed there to be.</p><p>Standing here now, in a friend’s apartment, helping zip up a dress while trading mild insults and talking about the women they loved, she felt something loosen quietly inside her.</p><p>This was ordinary. Almost embarrassingly so.</p><p>And yet it felt extraordinary.</p><p>Agatha caught herself laughing—actually laughing—at something Jen said about Rio’s inevitable reaction. The sound surprised her. It wasn’t restrained or polite. It was warm.</p><p>She hadn’t realised how much she’d missed out on until she was standing in the middle of it.</p><p>“All right, Sandy,” Jen said brightly, tossing Agatha a black coat and grabbing her purse. “Let’s go get your Danny Zuko.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes as she caught the coat, even as a smile betrayed her. “Oh god, not the<em> Grease</em> reference.”</p><p>But she didn’t correct her. And she didn’t miss the way her chest warmed at the implication. It was ridiculous, and a little embarrassing, and strangely comforting all at once. Being teased like this felt… exciting.</p><p>The Witch’s Road was busier than Agatha had ever seen it, the low hum of voices and music spilling out into the street. She felt a flicker of gratitude that Wanda had pre-ordered them tickets. No waiting, no uncertainty. One less thing for Agatha’s mind to catalogue as a potential problem.</p><p>Inside, the familiar chaos wrapped around her.</p><p>Jen led the way, weaving confidently through the crowd toward the booth they always claimed, her hand briefly brushing Agatha’s elbow as if to keep her anchored.</p><p>Wanda and Nat were already there, seated closer than Agatha had ever seen them in public. Nat looked relaxed, loose in a way that only came with a couple of drinks, her knee angled toward Wanda without hesitation. Across from them, Kate sat with her chin propped on her hand, looking bored out of her mind as Billy talked animatedly, his hands moving almost faster than his words.</p><p>Kate clocked them and shot upright. “Finally! What took you guys so—”</p><p>Jen and Agatha shrugged out of their coats.</p><p>Kate stopped mid-sentence.</p><p>Her eyes widened as they landed on Agatha. “Holy shit Agatha, you look amazing. Rio is going to freak the fuck out.”</p><p>Heat crept up Agatha’s neck, a reflexive response to being seen like this. She straightened instinctively, chin lifting, professionalism trying to reassert itself.</p><p>“I don’t know what you’re referring to, Bishop,” she said coolly.</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes, smiling fondly.</p><p>“And where are Alice and Rio?” She asked, making Agatha grateful for the change in focus.</p><p>Kate pointed toward the bar. “Drinks run.”</p><p>Agatha followed the line of her finger and found them immediately. Two familiar silhouettes with their backs turned, laughing about something she couldn’t hear.</p><p>Her pulse picked up.</p><p>She didn’t know exactly what she was bracing for. Maybe Rio’s reaction. Maybe her own. Either way, she knew she was about to find out as Rio and Alice turned from the bar and started toward them, drinks balanced carefully on a tray.</p><p>Rio’s focus was entirely on not spilling anything. Agatha could tell by the way her face was scrunched in concentration, tongue caught just slightly between her teeth as she navigated the crowd. It was endearing in a way that made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>It also gave her time.</p><p>Time to take in Rio properly.</p><p>She’d chosen tight black jeans that showed off the powerful lines of her thighs with every step, muscle shifting beneath denim in a way Agatha had always admired. The cropped green silk button-up sat open just enough to flash a teasing glimpse of Rio’s stomach, the defined planes of her abs appearing and disappearing with each careful shuffle forward. And, of course, there were the Doc Martens. </p><p>Unmistakably Rio.</p><p>Agatha felt a flicker of something low and warm curl through her, quickly followed by a quieter thought she hadn’t expected. Pride. This woman was with her. Chose her.</p><p>Rio was about five feet away when she finally lifted her gaze from the tray, clearly satisfied she’d made it through the worst of the crowd. </p><p>Her eyes found Agatha.</p><p>And everything stopped.</p><p>Agatha watched Rio’s expression fracture and reform all at once. Happiness gave way to surprise, then something softer and almost hungry. Her mouth parted, her eyes roaming openly from Agatha’s hair to her dress to the heels she almost never wore.</p><p>For one suspended moment, Agatha wondered if she might actually be able to hear her heart over the music.</p><p>Alice stepped in beside Rio just in time, steadying the tray as Rio nearly forgot she was holding it at all.</p><p>Jen barked out a laugh from the booth. Kate muttered something under her breath that sounded suspiciously like, “Called it.”</p><p>Alice reached the booth first, slipping past a visibly stunned Rio.</p><p>“Looking good, Harkness,” she said easily, setting the tray down and handing out the drinks before leaning in to press a quick kiss to Jen’s lips.</p><p>Rio followed a second later, slower now, like the air had thickened around her.</p><p>She set the tray down carefully, almost mechanically, and then stepped into Agatha’s space without hesitation, hands coming to rest on either side of her waist.</p><p>“Mi amor…” Rio breathed.</p><p>Agatha’s pulse spiked.</p><p>“You look… you look…”</p><p>For one fragile second, doubt crept in.</p><p>She imagined Rio laughing softly and saying it wasn’t her. That it was too much. Too showy. Too different from the woman she’d fallen in love with. Agatha felt absurd for even thinking it, but the fear flared anyway. She wasn’t used to stepping outside her armour. She wasn’t used to dressing to be desired.</p><p>Rio’s thumbs pressed gently into her hips, grounding her.</p><p>“You look,” Rio said again, voice thick with something deeper now, “incredible.”</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>Rio shook her head slightly, as if words were failing her. “You were already beautiful this morning. You’re beautiful in scrubs. In that purple sweater you pretend isn’t your favourite. But this…” Her eyes dragged slowly from Agatha’s curls down to the curve of the dress. “This feels unfair. You didn’t give me a heads up.”</p><p>A soft laugh rippled through the booth, but Rio didn’t look away.</p><p>“You look like you walked in here knowing exactly what you do to me,” she murmured, quieter now, just for her. “And I swear to God, if anyone else stares for more than two seconds, I’m throwing hands.”</p><p>Agatha felt the tension in her shoulders melt into something warmer. Rio wasn’t pulling away. She wasn’t confused.</p><p>She was undone.</p><p>“You like it?” Agatha asked, softer than she meant to.</p><p>Rio leaned in, brushing her lips just barely against Agatha’s ear.</p><p>“I love it,” she whispered. “But not as much as I'm gonna love tearing it off you.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in and kissed her, warm and certain, hands sliding up around Rio’s shoulders. The heels brought them nearly eye to eye for once, and the closeness felt grounding instead of strange. Rio’s hands tightened at her waist as the kiss deepened, unhurried and sure.</p><p>“Alright, lovebirds,” Wanda called out with a laugh. “Save it for midnight, huh?”</p><p>Rio pulled back just enough to rest her forehead against Agatha’s, smiling softly.</p><p>They slid into the booth beside Wanda and Nat, knees brushing under the table as everyone shuffled to make space.</p><p>Billy’s eyes widened the moment he realised who was now sitting across from him.</p><p>“Dr. Harkness! It’s good to see you. You look amazing. I mean, you always look good, I just mean you look extra good. Not that I mean that like I’m attracted to you because, you know, I’m gay, but—”</p><p>“Teen,” Agatha cut in smoothly. “Be cool man. And I suppose you can call me Agatha since we’re not in the hospital.”</p><p>Billy’s face lit up like she’d handed him an award. “Oh. Okay. Sure. Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha paused.</p><p>Her expression shifted immediately. “Actually, no. That feels weird. Dr. Harkness is fine.”</p><p>The table burst into laughter as Billy’s excitement deflated just as quickly.</p><p>Agatha leaned closer to Rio, brushing her nose lightly against her hair.</p><p>“So. I take it running sage through Lilia’s house went well?” she murmured, smoothing the collar of Rio’s shirt as if it needed adjusting.</p><p>Rio sniffed at herself, frowning. “I took two showers and I still smell like a spiritual bonfire. I swear that woman is walking fire hazard, I had to confiscate two of those weird ass looking candles.” She laughed shaking her head fondly, “did everything go okay at the hospital?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers stilled.</p><p>She looked into Rio’s eyes, bright and relaxed from the music and company. Happy. Carefree. </p><p>For a split second, the truth pressed at the back of her throat. She should tell her. She should mention Debbie’s parents, the conversation, the likelihood that Gabby would be leaving.</p><p>But she couldn’t bring herself to dim that light right now.</p><p>She forced a small smile. “Yes. All good.”</p><p>As the drinks flowed, the mood shifted into something looser, warmer. When <em>Pink Pony Club</em> came on, Wanda and Jen dragged Agatha onto the dance floor before she could protest. Rio stayed back with Nat, but Agatha could feel her watching.</p><p>And she let herself be watched.</p><p>She swayed her hips more boldly than usual, exaggerating a turn when she caught Rio’s eye. The answering look she received sent a thrill through her. For once, she wasn’t the composed surgeon. She wasn’t the guarded one. She was just a woman dancing, laughing, letting the music carry her.</p><p>Three songs passed before she realised how breathless she was. She couldn’t remember the last time she had let herself go like this. Maybe she never had.</p><p>Grinning, she signalled to Jen and Wanda that she needed a drink and made her way back toward the booth, slowing as she caught the tail end of Rio and Nat’s conversation.</p><p>“Her grandparents seem really nice,” Nat was saying. “I’m glad she’s going to have someone to look after her more permanently now.”</p><p>Agatha stopped.</p><p>She saw it the moment the words landed. The flicker of something breaking across Rio’s face. Shock first. Then hurt. Then the careful, practiced smoothing over.</p><p>“That’s great news,” Rio said evenly. “I’m glad she has family that can take care of her.”</p><p>Agatha’s stomach dropped.</p><p>Time seemed to slow as Agatha watched Rio murmur something polite, excuse herself from the booth, and slip away without looking back. The door closed behind her, quiet but final.</p><p>Agatha’s chest seized.</p><p>Rio had left.</p><p>The thought hit fast and sharp, blooming into something worse before she could stop it. Her mind filled in the gaps immediately, cruel and efficient. Of course she’d left. Agatha had lied by omission. She had hidden something that mattered. She had let Rio hope for a future she hadn’t been honest about.</p><p><em>This is what happens</em>, a familiar voice whispered. <em>This is what always happens when you get comfortable</em>.<br/>Her pulse roared in her ears. The music, the laughter, the warmth of the bar all fell away, replaced by the cold certainty she knew too well. </p><p>Love given. Love withdrawn. </p><p>Punishment for wanting too much.</p><p>She was already moving.</p><p>Heels slipping slightly as she pushed through the crowd, breath coming too fast, too shallow. Her hands felt numb as she shoved past bodies, barely registering the startled looks she earned. She needed to get outside. She needed to see Rio. </p><p>The door flew open and the cold night air hit her like a slap, sharp and unforgiving.</p><p>Her eyes darted wildly, panic tightening her vision, heart hammering so hard it hurt. For one terrifying second, she didn’t see her.</p><p><em>She’s gone</em>.</p><p>Then—there.</p><p>Rio was leaning against the brick wall just outside the bar, eyes closed, face tilted up toward the night sky as if she were trying to steady herself.</p><p>Agatha’s knees nearly buckled with relief and fear colliding all at once.</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>Rio’s eyes snapped open as she turned. “Agatha? What are you doing out—”</p><p>Agatha didn’t let her finish.</p><p>She crossed the distance in a few frantic steps, breath uneven, hands coming up helplessly, hovering between Rio’s face and the front of her shirt. She grabbed at both, grounding herself however she could.</p><p>“Baby, I’m so sorry,” she rushed out, words tumbling over each other. “I didn’t tell you about Gabby’s grandparents. I swear I was going to tell you tomorrow. I just didn’t want to ruin your evening. Please forgive me, my love. Please don’t leave me.”</p><p>The last words broke something open in her.</p><p>Rio froze, eyes widening as she took in Agatha properly. The panic etched into her face. The tears she hadn’t even realised were falling. The way her hands trembled like she was bracing for impact.</p><p>Rio understood immediately.</p><p>This wasn’t about tonight. Or Gabby. Or even the omission.</p><p>This was about loss. About being left.</p><p>Without hesitation, Rio cupped Agatha’s face, thumbs brushing gently beneath her eyes, wiping away the tears.</p><p>“Hey,” she said softly. “Hey. It’s okay, mi amor. I understand why you didn’t tell me. I’m not mad. I’m not going anywhere.”</p><p>“But you—you left,” Agatha hiccupped. “I thought—”</p><p>Rio leaned in, hands firm and steady, forcing Agatha to look at her. “Agatha. I promise you, I’m not going anywhere. I just needed some air. I’m sorry if I scared you.”</p><p>Then she pulled Agatha into her arms, holding her close, one hand cradling the back of her head as Agatha collapsed into her. Rio stayed there, solid and umwavering, until she felt Agatha’s breathing slow, her body easing back from the edge.</p><p>After a long moment, Rio pulled back slightly, her hands sliding down Agatha’s arms. She noticed the faint goosebumps rising along her skin, the way Agatha was rubbing her own arms in a small, unconscious attempt to warm herself.</p><p>“Come on,” Rio said gently. “Let’s get back inside before Kate actually punches Billy in the face.”</p><p>Agatha let out a soft, watery laugh, though her arms looped back around Rio’s waist as if she wasn’t quite ready to let go. She looked up into those warm brown eyes and saw it clearly now—the hurt Rio was trying so hard to tuck away. The brave face. The careful composure.</p><p>“I’m so sorry, Rio,” she said quietly. “I know how much you adore that little girl.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curved into a half-smile, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. She glanced down between them, nodding faintly.</p><p>“Yeah,” she admitted. “I do. But at least she has someone looking out for her. Someone who can give her a good life.” She swallowed. “I just hope we get to say goodbye before they leave.”</p><p>Agatha leaned in, pressing a soft, deliberate kiss to Rio’s mouth.</p><p>“I’ll make sure of it,” she promised.</p><p>They walked back inside together, fingers loosely intertwined, the warmth of the bar wrapping around them again. </p><p>At the booth, Wanda had migrated fully onto Natasha’s lap, arms draped around her shoulders. Jen and Alice were nowhere to be seen.</p><p>“There you are, Agatha Doctor Harknesssss,” Billy slurred dramatically as they slid into their seats opposite him and Kate, who made an exaggerated circling motion near her temple to indicate he was well past tipsy.</p><p>“This is why teenagers aren’t allowed to drink,” Agatha said dryly.</p><p>“I’m twenty four—no wait—I’m twenty five!” Billy protested, swaying slightly.</p><p>“Hmm. Are we sure about that?” Agatha arched a brow.</p><p>“Billy, water. Now,” Nat said firmly, sliding his drink away with practiced authority.</p><p>Wanda leaned in close to her ear. “Mmm, I love it when you act all mommy” she murmured—except not quietly enough.</p><p>The entire table heard.</p><p>Kate’s eyes went wide as she looked between Agatha and Rio, biting her lip to contain her laughter. </p><p>Agatha wasn’t so successful, a snort escaped before she could stop it, her hand flying to her mouth.</p><p>“Wanda, dear,” Nat said quickly, already standing. “Bathroom. Now.”</p><p>Agatha and Rio shuffled out of the booth to let them pass.</p><p>“Are you guys going to—<em>hiccup</em>—have sex in the bathroom?” Billy asked innocently, one eye half-closed.</p><p>The table erupted. Natasha’s face turned an impressive shade of red as she dragged Wanda away from the cackling trio behind them.</p><p>Alice and Jen returned just then, arms full of fresh drinks and a tray of shots.</p><p>“Where’d they go?” Alice asked, setting everything down.</p><p>“They’re going to fuck in the bathroom,” Rio said casually, accepting a beer.</p><p>“But it’s almost midnight?” Jen replied, not even looking up as she distributed the shots.</p><p>Kate stared at her. “That’s your reaction to them basically getting caught out?”</p><p>Jen snorted. “Please. I’ve walked in on those two way too many times in an on-call room to be shocked anymore.” She placed a glass of ice water firmly in front of Billy. “Hydrate.”</p><p>Wanda and Nat eventually reappeared a few minutes later, greeted by a chorus of knowing looks and a handful of shameless teasing about quick triggers and suspiciously flushed faces. Before anyone could linger on it too long, the DJ’s voice cut through the noise, announcing the countdown to midnight.</p><p>Agatha turned slightly toward Rio, the hum of the bar fading at the edges.</p><p>“You know,” she said softly, “earlier, when you talked about living together… did you really mean it?” She hesitated, then added, “Even if things didn’t work out with Gabby?”</p><p>The countdown began.</p><p><em>Ten.</em></p><p>Rio turned fully to face her, the world narrowing to the space between them. Her eyes shone, hopeful and careful all at once. “You’d still want that?” she asked. “Just… me? Us? Our own place?”</p><p>Agatha smiled, lifting a hand to tuck a loose strand of hair behind Rio’s ear, her thumb lingering there like it belonged. “More than anything.”</p><p><em>Five.</em></p><p>Rio’s face lit up, a full, unguarded smile breaking free. “Then yes. I absolutely meant it. I want to build a home with you, Agatha. Wherever that is.” Her voice softened. “You’re my everything.”</p><p>Agatha felt the weight of that settle warmly in her chest. “Then let’s find us a home.”</p><p>The crowd erupted.</p><p>“Happy New Year!”<br/> <br/>The crowd surged around them, voices rising, glasses clinking, laughter spilling into the air as midnight hit. Agatha barely registered any of it. Her focus stayed fixed on Rio, on the warmth of her hands, on the certainty in her smile.</p><p>They leaned into each other as the bar erupted, a kiss shared amid the noise and confetti, unhurried and sure. Agatha felt something settle quietly inside her as she held Rio there, solid and real and choosing her back.</p><p>The world didn’t feel so sharp anymore.</p><p>She wasn’t bracing herself. She wasn’t waiting for something to fall apart.</p><p>She was standing exactly where she wanted to be, with the woman she loved, already imagining a door they would open together.</p><p> </p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Debbie’s funeral was held on a Friday.</p><p>The sky had been a dull, undecided grey all morning, not quite raining but threatening to. Agatha stood beside Yelena near the back of the small chapel, both of them dressed in black, their presence professional but respectful. They had each played a part in Debbie’s final days. It felt wrong not to come.</p><p>The service was modest. A handful of family friends. A few distant relatives. Mr. and Mrs. Jenkins sat in the front row, shoulders touching, hands clasped so tightly their knuckles had gone pale. Grief hung thick in the air, heavy and unmoving.</p><p>A decision had been made not to bring Gabby.</p><p>She was too young, Susan had said gently. The noise, the finality of it, the lowered voices and tearful embraces. It would be confusing at best. Frightening at worst.</p><p>Agatha had agreed outwardly.</p><p>Inside, it had felt like another small, quiet ending.</p><p>Earlier that week, Susan had called her directly.</p><p>“I was wondering,” she had said carefully, “if Rio might like to sit with us while the service is going on. Just in one of the side rooms. Gabriella’s been asking about her.”</p><p>Agatha had closed her eyes at that.</p><p>Susan had continued, voice warm but practical. “Her grandparents plan to take her home with them after the funeral. We thought… it might be good for her to say goodbye in her own way. Somewhere calmer.”</p><p>Not a formal goodbye. Not something dramatic.</p><p>Just Rio sitting on the carpet with her. Maybe holding Teddy. Maybe explaining, in the steady way she did, that sometimes goodbye didn’t mean forgotten.</p><p>Agatha had relayed the message to Rio that night.</p><p>Rio hadn’t hesitated.</p><p>“Of course,” she had said immediately. No discussion. </p><p>Now, as the priest’s voice echoed gently through the chapel, Agatha found herself glancing toward the small side hallway where Susan and Rio were waiting with Gabby. She imagined Rio crouched down to Gabby’s height, speaking softly, letting the little girl cling to her if she needed to.</p><p>She imagined Gabby’s small hands wrapped in Rio’s shirt.</p><p>It struck Agatha then how strange it was, the shape of love. How it had grown so quickly around a child who was never meant to be theirs.</p><p>At the front of the chapel, Mrs. Jenkins stood to speak, her voice trembling as she described Debbie’s stubbornness as a child, her laugh, the way she used to insist on yellow birthday cakes because they “looked like sunshine.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed hard.</p><p>Yellow.</p><p>She could picture Gabby’s little face as she’d declared it her favourite colour for the same reason.</p><p>When the service ended and people began to file outside toward the cemetery, Agatha lingered near the aisle, watching as Debbie’s parents were embraced by relatives.</p><p>In a few minutes, they would walk down that side hallway.</p><p>In a few minutes, a small girl would be placed in their arms.</p><p>And Rio would have to let go.</p><p>After saying goodbye to Yelena, Agatha slipped away from the main chapel and made her way down the quiet side hallway. The murmur of voices faded with each step, replaced by something softer.</p><p>The door to the small sitting room was slightly ajar.</p><p>She paused when she heard Rio’s voice.</p><p>It was low, steady, the same tone she used as if calming someone at a scene. But gentler. Softer around the edges.</p><p>Agatha stepped inside quietly.</p><p>Gabby was curled into Rio’s side on a small upholstered chair, Teddy tucked under her chin. Rio had one arm wrapped securely around her, the other smoothing slow circles over her back.</p><p>“Your mommy’s body stopped working,” Rio was saying carefully. “Sometimes that happens, even when nobody wants it to. It’s not because she didn’t love you. And it’s not because you did anything wrong.”</p><p>Gabby’s small fingers twisted into the fabric of Rio’s shirt.</p><p>“But where is she?” she whispered.</p><p>Rio swallowed once before answering.</p><p>“She’s not somewhere you can visit,” she said gently. “But that doesn’t mean she’s gone from you. When someone we love dies, the part of them that loved us doesn’t disappear. It stays with us. In the stories we remember. In the things they taught us. In the way they made us feel safe.”</p><p>She brushed a curl away from Gabby’s forehead.</p><p>“When my mamá and papá died, I was little too,” Rio continued softly. “And I thought that meant I was alone. But my abuela told me something important. She said love doesn’t stop just because someone’s body does. It just changes shape.”</p><p>Gabby blinked up at her, wide-eyed.</p><p>“What shape?” she asked.</p><p>Rio smiled faintly. “Sometimes it’s the voice in your head that sounds like them when you’re trying to be brave. Sometimes it’s remembering what they liked. Or how they laughed. Sometimes it’s just knowing that if they could choose anything, they’d choose for you to be happy.”</p><p>Gabby was quiet for a moment.</p><p>“Mommy likes yellow too,” she said finally.</p><p>Rio’s expression softened. “Oh yeah?”</p><p>“Like the sun.”</p><p>Rio nodded. “Then maybe when you see something yellow, you can think of her. Like she’s sending you a little hello.”</p><p>Gabby pressed her face into Rio’s chest then, small shoulders trembling.</p><p>“I no want to forget her,” she murmured.</p><p>“You won’t,” Rio promised immediately. “And your grandma and grandpa won’t let you.”</p><p>Agatha felt her throat tighten in the doorway.</p><p>Rio didn’t look nervous. She didn’t stumble over her words. She spoke with the quiet certainty of someone who had lived this kind of loss and come out the other side still capable of love.</p><p>Gabby’s fingers were still tangled in her shirt, holding on.</p><p>And Rio was letting her.</p><p>Agatha heard footsteps in the hallway before she saw them.</p><p>The low murmur of voices. The careful clearing of a throat. She knew, even before she turned, that this was the moment she had been quietly bracing for all afternoon.</p><p>Debbie’s parents approached with Susan beside them. Mrs. Jenkins’ eyes were swollen from crying, a tissue clutched tightly in her hand. Mr. Jenkins carried himself with a kind of brittle composure, grief barely contained beneath it.</p><p>“Thank you for coming today, Dr. Harkness,” he said solemnly.</p><p>Agatha inclined her head. “Of course.”</p><p>The door opened wider.</p><p>Inside the room, Rio and Gabby both looked up.</p><p>For a second, no one moved.</p><p>Then Susan stepped forward gently. “Okay, Gabby sweetie. It’s time to go with Grandma and Grandpa.”</p><p>Gabby’s small face crumpled just slightly before she caught herself. She turned back to Rio, offering a brave, wobbly smile.</p><p>Agatha watched Rio carefully.</p><p>From the outside, she looked steady. Strong. She knelt down so she was eye-level with Gabby, hands resting lightly on the little girl’s shoulders. But Agatha saw it—the faint glassiness in her eyes, the way she blinked a little too hard before smiling.</p><p>“Will you come visit me?” Gabby asked, looking up at Rio, then flicking her gaze to Agatha as if making sure the promise would hold.</p><p>Rio’s expression softened in a way that made Agatha’s chest ache.</p><p>“Sure, kiddo,” she said gently. “Maybe not all the time. But I promise we’ll come visit you soon, okay?”</p><p>Agatha knew what Rio wasn’t saying.</p><p>That New Jersey to Chicago was more than twelve hours by car. That life had a way of getting complicated. That sometimes promises were harder to keep than they sounded.</p><p>But Rio didn’t let any of that touch her voice.</p><p>Gabby stepped forward and wrapped her arms around Rio’s neck. Rio hugged her back tightly, eyes closing for a moment longer than necessary.</p><p>When they pulled apart, Gabby turned to Agatha.</p><p>“Bye, Doctor Agatha,” she said solemnly.</p><p>Agatha crouched down, brushing a hand over the little girl’s hair. “Goodbye, Gabriella. Be brave. And remember what we talked about.”</p><p>Gabby nodded once, clutching Teddy to her chest.</p><p>Then she slipped her small hand into her grandmother’s.</p><p>Agatha stood beside Rio as they watched the family walk down the hallway. Neither of them spoke. They simply stood there, shoulders nearly touching, until the sound of footsteps faded and the door at the end of the corridor closed.</p><p>Without turning, Agatha reached down and hooked her fingers through Rio’s beside her.</p><p>Their hands fit together instinctively, familiar and grounding.</p><p>She kept her gaze fixed on the now-empty hallway, on the place where Gabby had disappeared from view, because she knew the second she looked at Rio—really looked at her—the careful composure would fracture.</p><p>Rio’s grip tightened in response, just once.</p><p>They stood there in the quiet aftermath, grief shared but unspoken. Neither of them trusted their voice. Neither of them wanted to be the first to let it crack.</p><p>So they didn’t look at each other.</p><p>They just held on.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>Over the next few weeks, they threw themselves into the promise they had made on New Year's Eve.</p><p>They would build a home. Together.</p><p>It wasn’t just talk. Between shifts and long nights, they toured houses, argued gently over kitchens and closet space, and sent each other listings at ridiculous hours.</p><p>Thanks to Lilia’s connections, they eventually found it—a spacious three-bedroom house tucked into a quiet street not far from Lilia’s place. </p><p>Close enough to the hospital. Close enough to the fire station.</p><p>The day finally arrived when they would move in.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t slept.</p><p>She had lain awake the entire night, staring at the ceiling, her mind running through worst-case scenarios with clinical precision. What if this was too fast? What if living together changed things? What if she ruined it? What if Rio realised she was too difficult, too guarded, too much?</p><p>Happiness always came with a warning label in Agatha’s experience. She had learned to look for the crack before the fall.</p><p>Rio had been on shift, unable to curl around her and quiet the spiral the way she usually did. She’d called before dawn instead, voice warm and steady.</p><p>“I’ll meet you at the house later, okay? We’re doing this.”</p><p><em>We’re doing this</em>.</p><p>With an overly emotional farewell to Lilia the next morning, Agatha loaded her modest collection of belongings into her black Mercedes. A few boxes. Books. Clothes. The essentials of a life that had always felt temporary.</p><p>“Lilia, I’m literally two streets away,” Agatha said dryly as Lilia pulled her into a crushing hug. “Why are you crying?”</p><p>“I’m just so proud of how far you’ve come, my girl,” Lilia replied, brushing at her eyes. “I’m happy for you.”</p><p>The words lodged somewhere tender.</p><p>When Agatha pulled into the driveway of the new house, Rio’s truck was already there.</p><p>Agatha turned off the engine and sat still for a moment, hands resting on the steering wheel.</p><p><em>Their driveway</em>.</p><p>She stepped out slowly, gaze sweeping over the small front garden, the porch, the windows that would soon hold their things.</p><p><em>Their house</em>.</p><p>The word felt foreign and enormous.</p><p>She had never been part of a<em> their</em> before.</p><p>Their kitchen. Their couch. Their mornings.</p><p>Their bed.</p><p>The thought sent something equal parts fear and longing through her chest. </p><p>The front door opened.</p><p>Rio stepped out onto the porch, grinning, sleeves rolled up, already looking like she’d claimed the place.</p><p>“There you are,” she called.</p><p>Agatha closed the car door gently and let herself smile back.</p><p>“Welcome home.” Rio said, wrapping her arms around her waist. </p><p>And suddenly, any doubt and fear Agatha had was gone. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><br/>Agatha would have loved to claim she had taken a leading role in the decorating and logistics of moving.</p><p>In reality, she hadn’t.</p><p>Rio was good at it. Naturally good. She could look at an empty room and immediately see where the couch should go, where the light would hit best in the mornings, which wall needed colour and which needed to breathe.</p><p>She moved through the house with a kind of quiet certainty, sleeves rolled up, measuring tape clipped to her jeans like she’d been waiting her whole life for this.</p><p>And she worked.</p><p>Lifting. Carrying. Repositioning heavy furniture with a grunt and a laugh when Agatha inevitably offered “helpful direction.” A faint sheen of sweat gathered at her temples, darkening the collar of her T-shirt. </p><p>At one point she dragged the couch a full foot to the left, stepped back, squinted at it, then dragged it right back again without complaint.</p><p>Agatha mostly stood back and watched.</p><p>She told herself it was because Rio clearly had a vision. Because too many opinions would only complicate things. But the truth was, she liked watching her.</p><p>The flex of muscle beneath fabric when she lifted a box. The way she pushed her hair back with the back of her wrist, leaving a faint streak of paint near her temple. The soft hitch in her breath when she set something heavy down and rolled her shoulders.</p><p>And Agatha found herself appreciating every single second of it.</p><p>They hadn’t done it alone. Tony had arrived first with a rented truck and an unnecessary amount of commentary. Bucky had carried furniture like it weighed nothing, Peter trailing after him with wide-eyed enthusiasm and too many questions about load-bearing walls.</p><p>Alice, Kate, and Yelena had claimed the painting as their territory, turning it into a chaotic, paint-splattered event complete with loud music and increasingly questionable straight lines. Yelena insisted she had “excellent artistic instincts.” Kate disagreed loudly.</p><p>Jen didn’t even pretend she would be participating in the heavy lifting.</p><p>“Oh absolutely not,” she had said, stepping neatly around a box labeled kitchen. “My talents are intellectual.”</p><p>Instead, she stationed herself beside Agatha on the floor of the living room with a stack of home-style magazines, legs crossed, glasses perched low on her nose as she flipped through pages with dramatic seriousness.</p><p>“This is a warm neutral,” she’d announce, tapping a page. “You two are a warm neutral couple. No millennial greys. And we are absolutely not doing farmhouse chic.”</p><p>Agatha had rolled her eyes, but she hadn’t moved away.</p><p>They debated colour swatches. Argued over throw pillows. Googled the proper pronunciation of feng shui three separate times.</p><p>And somewhere between the laughter, the paint fimes, and the steady thud of furniture being placed into position, Agatha felt it settle in her bones.</p><p>At some point, Lilia and Sharon arrived like a well-organised storm, arms full of trays and foil-covered dishes that could have fed half the neighbourhood. </p><p>Within minutes, they had transformed the still half-unpacked kitchen into something warm and lived-in, pushing boxes aside to create a makeshift buffet along the counter.</p><p>The house, which had echoed that morning, now hummed.</p><p>Cold beers were passed around. Someone put music on through a phone speaker. Laughter bounced off freshly painted walls that still smelled faintly of drying paint and new beginnings.</p><p>Agatha stood in the doorway to the kitchen, a beer cradled loosely in one hand, her other arm folded across her waist as if holding something steady inside herself. She watched the chaos unfold.</p><p>Jen and Tony were bickering over whether the couch was technically mid-century modern or just “expensive-looking.” Lilia’s laugh rang out, full and unapologetic, at something Alice had muttered under her breath. Sharon was insisting everyone take seconds before they had even finished their first plate.</p><p>The house was loud, alive and full.</p><p>Agatha felt something unfamiliar settle in her chest. She had finally found <em>her people. </em></p><p>Warm arms slipped around her from behind, solid and certain, and Rio’s chin rested gently on her shoulder.</p><p>“You okay, mi amor?” Rio murmured, voice low and private against her ear.</p><p>Agatha’s smile deepened. She placed her hand over Rio’s forearm, leaning her head back so it rested against Rio’s collarbone, letting herself sink into the contact without hesitation.</p><p>She took in the scene one more time—the people, the noise, the life already blooming inside these walls.</p><p>“Better than okay,” she said softly, turning her head and capturing Rio’s lips in a soft kiss.</p><p>Someone wolf-whistled from the kitchen.</p><p>“Alright, we get it,” Tony called out. “New homeowners, very romantic. Now tell me—what are you two doing with the two spare rooms? Home gym? Office? Sex dungeon?” Lilia smacked him upside the head.</p><p>Sharon perked up immediately. “It’s a good size for a family home, actually.”</p><p>There was a beat.</p><p>Agatha felt Rio’s arms tighten slightly around her waist.</p><p>“A family-sized home?” Jen echoed lightly, arching a brow as she sipped her beer. “Three bedrooms <em>is</em> ambitious for just the two of you.”</p><p>The room didn’t go silent, exactly—but it shifted. The energy softened into something curious and warm.</p><p>Agatha felt heat rise up her neck.</p><p>They hadn’t really talked about it. Not properly. Not beyond the edges of the Gabby conversation, which had been wrapped in grief and what-ifs. </p><p>They had talked about space. About light. About proximity to work.</p><p>Not specifically about children.</p><p>Rio cleared her throat.</p><p>“Yeah,” she said simply. “Eventually. I want kids.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skipped.</p><p>Not whispered. Not hedged. Not a joke.</p><p>Just stated.</p><p>She turned in Rio’s arms, blinking up at her. “You want kids… plural?”</p><p>Rio smiled, almost shy but not embarrassed. “Yeah. I do.”</p><p>Agatha swallowed. “H-how many?”</p><p>Rio shrugged like it was the most natural thing in the world. “Two.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes widened. “Two?”</p><p>Rio laughed softly. “Yeah. So they always have someone. Someone to build forts with. Someone to blame when they piss us off.” Her voice warmed. “I always wished I had a sibling.”</p><p>The simplicity of it hit Agatha square in the chest.</p><p>It wasn’t about numbers. It was about feeling like you belonged.</p><p>Rio dipped her head slightly, brushing her nose against Agatha’s. “I just… I’d like a house that’s loud. Full. A little chaotic. With you in it.”</p><p>There was a collective, unashamed chorus of “Aww” from the kitchen.</p><p>Jen clutched her chest dramatically. “Oh my god.”</p><p>Kate actually wiped an imaginary tear.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hear most of it.</p><p>She was too busy staring at the woman in front of her, heart melting in real time, realising that the future Rio imagined—messy, noisy, shared—had her at the centre of it.</p><p>"Sounds like a good plan."</p>
