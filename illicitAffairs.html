     Chapter Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      She leaned against the door to remove her heels, watching as Agatha did the same from across the room. Her fingers twitched slightly. She couldn't believe she was actually doing this.
     </p>
     <p>
      Or well, actually, she did. She had, somehow, known from the second she met Agatha that she'd end up in bed with her. She just didn't want to admit it. Call it lesbian intuition or whatever.

     Chapter Notes

    <blockquote>
     <p>
      sooooo, this came to me in a dream after i got in a situationship with a married woman twice my age. hooray!
     </p>
     <p>
      a big part of this chapter was written with one hand because i got in an accident and ended up with 7 (seven) second degree burns in my right hand (and i'm right handed so) and then the pain stressed me out so much that i got an endometriosis flareup that landed me in the hospital (i'm fine btw, when you deal with endometriosis for 10 years it's just another day in your life nothing to worry about lmao). HOORAY²! so not to brag but i think i deserve a A+ for the effort.
     </p>
     <p>
      and last but not least, english isn't my first language so apologies for any mistakes ♡ enjoy!

     When Rio Vidal submitted her application for the recently opened position as Agatha Harkness' stylist, she wasn't really expecting to get an interview. Despite her great credentials, Agatha Harkness was still the best actress of her generation. Not only that, but she was always being featured in fashion magazines for her red carpet looks — so much so that Rio was shocked to see the position suddenly open. So, when she got an email back, she figured it was just a courtesy rejection. Instead, a week later, she was being led through her house for a personal interview with Agatha herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's assistant knocked once and pushed the two big wooden doors that led to Agatha's home office open. “Mrs. Harkness, your appointment is here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was sitting comfortably on a leather chair behind her desk, flipping absentmindedly through a thick script. She looked up as Rio was led in and dropped the script onto the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good luck,” her assistant mumbled, before leaving the room, closing the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio Vidal,” she mused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed thickly. “Yes, Mrs. Harkness, it's an honor to—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tsked. “None of that. It's Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze dragged over her. “Well, aren't you something?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head. “Thank you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “That was a compliment, darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sit,” Agatha said, pointing lazily to the chair across from hers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, you're a FIT girl,” she said as soon as Rio sat down, looking at the resume in front of her. “Graduated at the very top of your class. That's not an easy feat.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It wasn't. I worked really hard.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled approvingly. “Can I see your portfolio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, of course.” Rio took a thick folder out of her bag and handed it over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flipped through it for a while, stopping to analyze a page every now and then. She looked back up at Rio. “Your work is impressive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I mean it. This is one of the best portfolios I've seen in a while.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I work really hard,” Rio said again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You minored in… fashion theory?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “I studied how you can style someone to shape the public perception of them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha propped her chin on her hand. “So, what you're saying is that you can use outfits to manipulate someone?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's more of a control thing.” Rio cleared her throat. “It's, like, if you want to be in control, you can be.”
    </p>
    <p>
     An amused smirk spread through Agatha's lips. “I like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hated how much her stomach flipped at that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     like control, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” she blurted. Agatha's smirk widened, and Rio cleared her throat. “I mean, it's useful. In fashion.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze dropped to her mouth for a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I see your references?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Of course,” she said simply, pulling a thick envelope out of her bag.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed and opened the envelope. She raised an eyebrow as she began to read. “One of the most promising stylists I've mentored,” she murmured. “Talent beyond her years.” She looked up at Rio and smiled. “That's quite a reputation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't know how to react to compliments, do you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I just—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you have your sketchbook with you?” Agatha interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My—my sketchbook?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded. “Your resume also mentions that you designed a lot in the past. I'd like to see it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hesitated, but still looked through her bag for her sketchbook, handing it out. Agatha's fingers brushed hers for a second too long. Rio inhaled sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's more of a side thing now. I still do it sometimes, just for myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed before getting up and circling the desk, perching herself on the edge closest to Rio and opening the sketchbook across her legs. Rio couldn't help but stare at her legs for a little too long before looking back up, her breath hitching slightly, and Agatha obviously noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're nervous,” Agatha pointed out, meeting her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to pretend she hadn't noticed how Agatha's gaze flickered to the lesbian bracelet she was wearing, and then up to her mouth again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not,” Rio replied. Too quickly. Agatha smirked, still looking at her lips. “I just wasn't expecting you to want to see my sketches.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm.” Agatha turned her gaze back to the sketchbook and flipped through it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stopped at a rough sketch of a sparkling dark green dress with a high slit and tapped her fingernail against it. “This one is especially beautiful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's not even finished.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignored that. “It's stunning.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know, I usually have someone do the interviews for me. I'm glad I decided to interview you myself. Your work is exceptional.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're hired,” she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “Wait, what? Just like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Would you rather I make you beg?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's breath hitched.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No!” she blurted. “I just thought—I didn't think it'd be this quick.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “I know what I want when I see it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio could respond, she was startled by two knocks at the door. The door burst open and a little boy ran in. Agatha's son, she presumed. He almost tripped on the bunny plushie he was dragging by the ears as he ran toward Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mama!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed. “Nicky, love, what are you doing out of bed?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He ignored her, turning toward Rio instead. “Who's this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha picked him up and sat him on her lap. “This is Rio. She's going to be my new stylist.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about Miss Wanda?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda isn't coming back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because she doesn't want to,” she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
     He pouted. “I liked her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” she said, softly now, stroking his hair. “But you'll like Miss Rio too. Won't he?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was caught off-guard by that, but she still nodded. “Of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He clutched his plushie tighter. “Are you good?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “At my job?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I guess I am, for your mom to hire me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He squinted at her. “Do you like bunnies?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “Uh—yes. Bunnies are cool.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He beamed. “What's your favorite breed of bunnies?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio froze, and Agatha caught her hesitation. She made a mental note to research bunny breeds later.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, Nicky, that's enough for today. Go back to bed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now, Nicholas.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, okay,” he muttered quietly, sliding off her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     He paused as he walked past Rio. “Can you fix him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Señor Scratchy,” he said, holding up his plushie so that Rio could see the small rip in one of its ears.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can stitch him up for you, yeah,” she replied. “Wouldn't even take long.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at Agatha, who shrugged, before nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky tilted his head, analyzing her for a few more seconds. “I guess you're cool.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched him as he padded out of the room before turning her gaze back to Rio. “Do you like children?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “I helped raise my younger siblings. I'm pretty good with kids.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled. “He can be a lot sometimes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head. “I don't mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you tell him that, he'll latch onto you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled weakly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,” she drawled. “Do you need time to think?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head again. “No. I'm in.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great. You'll start on Monday,” she said. “I'll arrange for you to meet Wanda Maximoff today. She's my former stylist and will brief you on my preferences. My assistant will send you the details later.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio exhaled. “Thank you. For hiring me. It's really going to be an honor to work for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed and extended her hand. Rio hesitated for a bit before taking it. Agatha shook it lightly before sliding off the desk and walking toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, and Rio?” she said, glancing over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't have to be that nervous around me. I don't bite.” A pause. “Unless you ask me to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “My assistant will see you out shortly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Until then, Rio wondered what the fuck she had just gotten herself into.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She met Wanda Maximoff in a small café downtown a few hours later. She was already sitting in a corner booth and scrolling absentmindedly through her phone when Rio arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda Maximoff? I'm Rio Vidal, Agatha Harkness' new stylist,” she said, extending her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Took you long enough,” Wanda said, not bothering to look up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled her hand back and checked her watch. She was five minutes early, but she decided not to argue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you for meeting me,” she said as she sat down across from Wanda.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's not like I had a choice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cleared her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright. Let's make this quick,” Wanda said dryly, placing a thick folder on the table. “This is a collection of past looks, notes in general, her favorite designers…”
    </p>
    <p>
     She explained a few things as she flipped through the folder. Agatha loves purple, except when it has patterns. Patterns are only acceptable in green, actually — except for florals, she hates them no matter what. Allergic to wool. She had so many peculiarities that Rio was dizzy by the time Wanda flipped to the last page.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you have any other questions, or am I free to go?” she asked when she was done.
    </p>
    <p>
     A beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know it's none of my business, but why did you quit?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Another beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean, you quit, right? She said that—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Harkness says a lot of things,” she replied flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda sighed. “Look. There's one more thing you have to know about Agatha Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There's nothing in this world that she enjoys more than fucking her stylists. She always has, and always will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio burst out laughing. Wanda's expression didn't change.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're joking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda held her gaze. She stopped laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She has a husband.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda raised an eyebrow and scoffed. “And she also has an assistant who's an expert in booking hotel rooms under different names and the money to sue the life out of whoever threatens to expose her little scheme.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He doesn't know. Frankly, he's an idiot. And he travels for work all the time, so it's not like he's around to keep her in check. When he's around, she's the perfect wife and mother. People don't question it because she doesn't give anyone any reason to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, but that’s not why she hired me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda smirked. “I don't doubt that she liked your portfolio, but I think that she liked your face even more. Young, pretty and talented. You're exactly her type.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence stretched between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda exhaled sharply. “She won't ever make you do anything you don't want to do, if that's what you're worried about. She's not like that. But she knows how to make you want her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't even know why you're telling me all this. You don't know if I'm into women or—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda scoffed and pointed at Rio's bracelet. “Well, you're not exactly subtle about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Right.
    </p>
    <p>
     A beat. Then, Rio asked, “How long did you two—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Two years, on and off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And before you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let's just say I wasn't the first, Rio. And I certainly won't be the last.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stiffened. “Did anyone know about the two of you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda shrugged. “Some of my friends, yes. I wouldn't tell them everything, but they knew that it was happening. I'd imagine her assistant knows to some extent. Her driver definitely knows. As long as they don't say anything to the media, which they have no reason to, Harkness doesn't really give a shit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed thickly. She hesitated before asking, “Did you love her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda looked down at her cup and sighed. That was the only answer she needed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She makes you feel special. And when she looks at you the way that she does, you'll be convinced that you're different and that she actually cares about you and not about the sex.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And why did you finally decide to leave?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Has anyone ever told you that you ask a lot of questions?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry, I just—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Wanda exhaled sharply and got up. “If you want some advice, just keep your head down and do your job. And don't think that you're any different, because you aren't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at Rio's bracelet again and pointed at it. “And if I were you, I wouldn't wear that around Ralph.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed her bag and swung it over her shoulder without waiting for an answer. “Anyways. Good luck to you. You'll need it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks, I guess,” she said quietly, but Wanda had already left.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kicked off her heels as she walked into the apartment that she shared with her childhood best friends. She met Alice Gulliver and Jennifer Kale in first grade, and they had been inseparable ever since, having moved in together during college.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice jumped up from the couch as soon as she saw her. “And? How did it go?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Which part? The one where Agatha Harkness hired me on the spot or—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Not surprisingly, she was interrupted by Alice and Jen shrieking and jumping around her. She exhaled sharply and held up her hand, which somehow worked and made them stop yelling.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Or the part where her former stylist told me that I just signed up to be Agatha Harkness' next fucktoy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence. Then, in unison, “Wait, what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sunk into the couch with a groan. She spent the next half an hour telling them about the interview and about her meeting with Wanda. She only left out the less important parts, such as Agatha saying she could bite her if Rio asked. It'd undoubtedly have been so much quicker if Alice and Jen wouldn't have kept interrupting her to either gasp dramatically or to ask a random question.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, pause,” Alice eventually said. “You're telling us that your insanely hot and rich boss is actively looking to cheat on her unsuspecting husband with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not what I said at all. Listen, I'm not even sure if I believe it. It might all be an elaborate prank to mess with her new stylist, for all I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And if it isn't a prank, what's your plan?” Jen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at her like she had just asked the most obvious question in the world. “To do my job and not fuck my married boss.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen exchanged glances and burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. “What? This isn't funny.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You expect us to believe that you, Rio Vidal, will turn down a chance to get laid?” Alice said, still laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do have some self-control, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Must I remind you of your body count in college?” Jen pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “First of all, fuck you. Second, it doesn't mean I'll fuck my married boss.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen shrugged. “It's not our fault that you have a track record.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Okay, I had some fun in college, what's the problem with that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I had some fun in college,” Jen echoed, chuckling. “You fucked over half of the women in your class.
     <em>
      And
     </em>
     a professor.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice gasped. “Oh my god, I had forgotten about the professor.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The professor was a one time thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You still ended up on her desk.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I didn't.” She paused. “Okay, one time was on her desk.” Another pause. She cleared her throat. “A few times were on her desk. It doesn't matter, okay? None of these women were married, which was my whole point.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So,” Alice drawled. “What you're saying is that if your insanely hot, insanely rich boss wasn't married, you'd let her rail you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed. “No. Even if I was interested, which I'm not—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen raised an eyebrow. “You're not?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned. “Okay, she's, like, insanely hot. If she wasn't married, maybe I'd fuck her.
     <em>
      Maybe
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not a no,” Alice said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, it is. I'm not a homewrecker. That's a line I won't ever cross.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen exchanged a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wouldn't blame you if you did,” Jen said. “I'd totally fuck Agatha Harkness if she thought that I was hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She doesn't think that I'm hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course not. She was just staring at your mouth because she was interested in what shade of lipstick you were wearing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Seriously now, I know that you two are finding this really funny, but it has to stay between us. No one can know that this is going on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So there is something going on,” Alice said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shot her a glare. “With her past stylists, yeah. I'm not falling for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean it. I need you two to promise me that you'll keep your mouths shut.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen snorted. “Do you think I'd risk getting sued by Agatha Harkness for telling someone that she likes to have some fun outside of her marriage?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed and ran her hands through her face. “I need some sleep. Today was insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She left before they could come up with yet another way to tease her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Hours later, she was still awake. She only slept after she finished the sketch Agatha had liked, much later that night.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had a slight feeling that she was fucked. And that she'd be fucking Agatha Harkness sooner than later. She shook that last thought off. Agatha was one of the hottest women had ever come across, sure, but she was also married. Rio would never risk ruining a family for some obviously casual sex. Or at least she was fairly certain about that.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Monday came by way too fast. Before Rio knew it, she was being led through Agatha's house and into her office again. Agatha's assistant knocked twice before opening the door and waving her in.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, Agatha was in the company of a man. Rio recognized him as Ralph Bohner. She didn't know much about him other than the fact that he was Agatha's
     <em>
      idiot
     </em>
     husband who was rarely around. That and the fact that he had a major investments company, according to LinkedIn. She hadn't stalked his profile, of course. She just spent a good half an hour looking at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked up as soon as she stepped into the room. Agatha smirked and leaned back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio quickly pulled her sleeves down, covering her bracelet. She cursed herself for forgetting that she wasn't supposed to be wearing it here. Agatha caught the movement and tilted her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph, this is Rio Vidal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard and forced herself to smile. “Mr. Bohner.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph,” he said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cleared her throat. “Ralph.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He smiled as he walked up to her. “So you're the new girl my wife hasn't stopped talking about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “I—she hasn't?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha has been obsessed with you,” he said. “At one point, I had to ask myself if I should be worried.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled nervously and looked at Agatha, who winked at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously. She hasn't stopped talking about you. It's always ‘
     <em>
      Ralph, you have to see her work
     </em>
     ’, ‘
     <em>
      Ralph, she'll be the best stylist I ever had
     </em>
     ’,” he said with a low chuckle. “And she's had a lot of stylists, so that's quite the compliment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “That's really nice of her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph studied her for a while longer before checking his watch. He turned to Agatha. “Well, I have to go. I have a flight to catch and Jeff asked for a ride to the airport.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed and got up. “I can't believe you're already leaving again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph didn't seem to notice how the movement made the silk robe Agatha was wearing slide a little down her shoulder. Rio hoped that he also didn't notice the way that she was staring at his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll be back before you know it,” Ralph said softly, walking toward her and cradling her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Friday?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Saturday,” he corrected. “Jeff arranged a last minute meeting with some investors on Friday night, so we had to change our flight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted. “I hate it when you leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You love the money, though,” he pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Touché.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph leaned in to press a lingering kiss to her lips, which made Rio scan the floor until she found a particularly interesting stain to stare at. She shifted uncomfortably when they exchanged I love you's.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll call you when I land.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha simply nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph walked toward the door, stopping by Rio on his way out. “Nice meeting you, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Likewise.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And take care of my wife. Make sure she behaves herself while I'm gone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stiffened slightly. “Yes, of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze shifted to Agatha, who rolled her eyes and waved a hand dismissively.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhaled dramatically as soon as the door clicked shut behind him. “God, I thought he'd never leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. “You make it sound like he's a burden.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Men are always a burden.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Even the one you married?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Especially
     </em>
     the one I married.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know what to say to that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who does he think he is to tell me that I love the money? For fuck's sake. I can make more money with two interviews than what his company makes in a whole year.”
    </p>
    <p>
     ‘I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held up a hand. “Don't even get me started on that Jeff guy. He's Ralph's best friend. They're never apart because of the stupid company they founded together. And then when Ralph comes home, it's always ‘
     <em>
      we should go over to the Kaplans. Me and Jeff have so much catching up to do
     </em>
     ’.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held up her hand again. “And then they'll disappear for hours to do God knows what, and I have to deal with Jessica Kaplan, who somehow manages to be more unbearable than her husband.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't try to say anything this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She thinks she's a saint for running a charity for… God, I don't even remember what. Something about kids, I think. It's not even her money. And if I don't look absolutely thrilled when he finally comes back, he'll be like, ‘
     <em>
      you could at least pretend to like my friends
     </em>
     ’.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed. “I'm sorry. I'm dumping all my shit on you, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can dump shit on me,” Rio blurted.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha met her gaze and smirked. “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean—you can talk to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's smirk widened. “Good to know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shifted uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You covered your bracelet,” Agatha pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wanda said—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know what she said.” Agatha reached for her wrist and pulled Rio's sleeve back up. “You don't really have to worry about it. He's not smart enough to know what it means.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cleared her throat. “Anyways. So. Work?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Eager, darling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? No. I just—I assume that we have a lot to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha studied for a second and chuckled. “Right. Follow me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard before obeying.
    </p>
    <p>
     She barely held back a gasp when they finally reached Agatha's closet. It had to be almost the size of Rio's apartment, and it was filled with designer clothes, shoes and purses that Rio knew cost more than she'd make in a year. Maybe two, for some of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I believe the word you're looking for is impressive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Insanely impressive, yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Well, as you know, I have a reputation to maintain. And now it's your job to help me do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her first day started simple enough and mostly consisted of planning outfits for Agatha's next appearances. She quickly learned that the peculiarities Wanda had told her about only added up to one percent of the real deal.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, she was adjusting a silk blouse over Agatha's shoulder, trying to make sure her fingers wouldn't linger too long anywhere. That seemed to be the hardest part of the job.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cleared her throat. She didn't know why, but she still asked, “Is it true what Ralph said about you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned her head, her mouth dangerously close to Rio's. “Which part?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio almost stumbled as she took a step back. “That you couldn't stop talking about me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She smirked. “Why do you want to know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hesitated. “Just curious.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do think you're fascinating, darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow and scoffed. “Should I be worried?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignored that question. “What else did Wanda tell you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's breath hitched. “A lot about your styling preferences.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing else.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed. “I don't believe that for a second. Wanda has quite the mouth on her when she wants to. I imagine that she has a few opinions about me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up. “I don't know what you're talking about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha obviously wasn't convinced. “Would you care if anything that she said was true?
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stilled her movements for a few seconds. “Honestly, Agatha, I do care that you seem to think I'd ever be a homewrecker.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow and stayed quiet for the rest of the session. Good.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was exhausted by the time they were done. All she wanted was to go home, take a warm shower, and scream into her pillow. Maybe submit her two-week notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Before you go,” Agatha said. “Nicky hasn't stopped talking about how you promised to fix his plushie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Right. Agatha had a kid.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “You could do it yourself, you know. Or is operating a sewing needle too much for you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry. I didn't mean—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. You're bold. I like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anyways. He wants you to fix it. I'll call him over for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha left before Rio could even nod. She took the chance to Google bunny breeds while Agatha was gone, just in case Nicky asked her about it again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She came back a while later, holding Nicky's hand. He clutched Señor Scratchy tightly with his other hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on, Nicky. Tell Miss Rio what you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He walked toward her, dragging the plushie behind him. “You said you'd fix him. So fix him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nicholas, say please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head. “Agatha, it's fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     His gaze shifted between the two of them. “Please?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ran a hand through his hair. “See? Not hard.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held out her hand and Nicky carefully handed Señor Scratchy over, watching as she got up and fished her bag for her sewing kit. As promised, she fixed the tear in a matter of minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky gasped when she handed the plushie back over. “How did you fix him that fast?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled. “I went to school for this sort of thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They don't teach me this sort of thing at my school!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put a hand on his shoulder. “Say thank you, Nicky.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kneeled next to him. “And Nicky?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I really like Holland Lops.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He beamed. “Me too! I like you a lot already, Miss Rio!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked at Agatha, who simply shrugged. She watched as Nicky ran out of the room without another word.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wow. Impressing me, impressing my son… congratulations. Not an easy feat.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thanks, I guess?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'll really have to learn how to take compliments, though,” she teased.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you're free to go. I'll see you tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't need to be told twice. She grabbed her bag and headed straight to the door. “See you tomorrow, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Back at her apartment, she barely managed to get two steps in before Jen's voice sounded from the kitchen. She could also hear Alice cackling, which meant that they had been talking about her and how she was undoubtedly going to fuck her boss while she was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      And
     </em>
     that woman is fucking weird,” Rio said, collapsing onto the couch. “She—first, she's acting all sweet around her husband, then—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait, wait, wait,” Alice interrupted. “You met her husband?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, he's as much of an idiot as Wanda had said, if that's what you want to know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Read my mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Anyways. Then he left for some work trip, and she started to complain about him and their marriage and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen snorted. “She so wants to fuck you. Making you hate her husband so you don't feel bad—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shot her a glare. “If you two keep interrupting me to be assholes about it, I'm not going to tell you anything about her. Ever.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That shut them up really fast, and Rio managed to give them a rundown of the rest of her day without any interruptions. She retreated to her room once she was done, finally being able to scream into her pillow a couple of times. That would quickly become part of her routine.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      . . .
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     The job itself was simple enough once she got used to the workload. Dealing with Agatha, however, wasn't getting any easier.
    </p>
    <p>
     It started out “innocently” enough. Some lingering looks and touches here and there. Subtle enough that Rio could almost convince herself that she was imagining things.
    </p>
    <p>
     One evening, however, she was shifting through some swatches while Agatha looked at herself in the mirror, adjusting the strap of the dress Rio had picked for her next event. When she looked back up, the dress that Agatha had been wearing was now pooled at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked when she caught Rio staring with an open mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, I'm so sorry,” Rio finally blurted. “I didn't—I'm so sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha still hadn't made an effort to cover herself up, so Rio looked down. She stole a few more discreet glances before turning around completely to try and regain control of her brain.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My fault, darling. You're so quiet that I forgot you were even there,” Agatha purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio heard the rustling of fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can look now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't, keeping her head low as she left the room without another word. She probably contributed a lot to the water crisis with the amount of water she had to splash on her face in the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Later that night, Rio was sketching in bed when her phone buzzed.

     <em>
      Good night, Vidal.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio threw her phone onto the bed and groaned into her pillow. She was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     fucked.
    </p>
    <p>
     The following evening, she was smoothing out her dark green dress. She had finished it a few weeks ago and figured that this was the perfect opportunity to wear it, since Agatha had liked the sketch. Not that she was wearing it for her or anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sighed as she finished touching up her makeup. She had chosen to do something simple. Not because she was hoping Agatha would ruin it, obviously. She just wasn't good with makeup. She'd just have to tell herself that a few more times in order to convince herself of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     After she finished putting on her heels, her gaze shifted to a hair tie on her nightstand. She briefly considered picking it up. No. She
     <em>
      was not
     </em>
     going to have sex with her very hot and very married boss. She practiced putting her hair up in a bun, just in case.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took one last look in the mirror before heading out of her room. The apartment was quiet, which either meant that Alice and Jen were still at work or that they were in their rooms. Rio was thankful either way, because she wasn't in the mood for the interrogation they'd put her through if they saw her leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was halfway through the living room when someone cleared her throat behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where are you going dressed like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio screamed. Alice screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alice, what the fuck? Why are you standing there in the dark?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice crossed her arms. “Why are you sneaking out in the dark?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not sneaking out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice's eyes narrowed. “Sure you aren't. Where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Uh—I'm going to visit Jen,” she blurted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jen… as in our roommate? The one who's in her room right now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     A beat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice gasped. “Oh my god. You’re going to see Agatha Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I'm not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “HEY JEN, COME HERE!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned. “Alice—”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pointed at Rio as soon as Jen walked into the living room. “Where do you think she's going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen didn't hesitate. “To see Agatha Harkness.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice suddenly grabbed her hand. “Oh my god, you clipped your nails.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They shrieked again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I didn't!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen's gaze shifted to Rio's chest. “You're not even wearing a bra,” she said, pointing at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Because it wouldn't look good with this dress.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice squinted. “And why didn't you pick another dress?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because Agatha liked—” A pause. She briefly considered jumping out of the window. “Because I like this one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice groaned and grabbed her purse from the hook next to the door. She took a ten dollar bill out of her wallet and handed it to Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio narrowed her eyes. “What was that about?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We may or may not have placed bets on how long it'd take for you to fuck her,” Jen said with a smirk. “I said a month. Alice was a little more hopeful in you and said three.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're placing bets on my sex life now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen and Alice grinned and nodded excitedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She snatched the bill from Jen's hand, lifting her arm when she tried to take it back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And to be clear, I haven't fucked her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “It's just dinner.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, a date.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A
     <em>
      professional
     </em>
     dinner.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her phone buzzed in her hand. Alice tried to take it from her, but she held it up and took a few steps back before looking at the screen.

     “As much as I've been enjoying discussing my sex life with you, my driver is here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice gasped dramatically. “She got you a
     <em>
      driver
     </em>
     ?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, yeah? Unless you wanted me to show up to a fancy ass restaurant in a taxi—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen exchanged a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Since when do you have money for a
     <em>
      fancy ass restaurant
     </em>
     ?” Jen asked, squinting.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? I don't. She's paying. Isn't that obvious?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Apparently it wasn't obvious, and admitting to it was a bad choice. They shrieked again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned and flung the door open, taking advantage of the fact that they were too busy still screeching. She flipped them off before slamming the door behind her. Freaks. She wondered if asking Agatha to buy her an apartment was a favor within reason.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her legs trembled slightly as she stepped into the elevator. They were trembling harder by the time she stepped out of her building.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's driver greeted her with a simple nod and opened the door for her. The drive to the restaurant was quiet save for Rio's heavy breathing and the hum of the engine.
    </p>
    <p>
     He stepped out of the car as soon as he parked in front of the restaurant and opened the door for her again. She swallowed hard before stepping out herself and prayed to a few different gods as she walked inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was already waiting at a corner booth as an employee led Rio through the restaurant.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I remember that dress,” Agatha said as Rio slid into the seat in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “You do?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm. It's that unfinished one from your sketchbook. Looks even better now that you're wearing it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's brain short-circuited, and the only thing that she could come up with was, “You promised me we'd discuss you giving me a raise.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “I did, didn't I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed. “You sound like you're about to tell me that you only agreed to it so that I'd come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's smirk widened. She shook her head. “Not at all, darling. I just think it'd be smart to save your favor for later.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “Convenient.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A waiter approached their table and handed them menus before taking a few steps back.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flipped through it a few times, frowning. Everything was ridiculously expensive.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha caught her hesitation. “Pick whatever you want, darling. Don't look at the numbers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't even know what these things are. Don't they have something normal? Like pasta?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled. “You're adorable.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head and turned her attention back to the menu, studying it for a while longer before sighing. “I'll just have whatever you're having.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Smart girl.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't going to reply to that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you drink?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Only on special occasions,” she lied. Drinking wine when she was already having to control herself not to drag Agatha to the bathroom probably wasn't a good idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good. We're drinking, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “I didn't say that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignored her. She called the waiter over and ordered a wine that sounded ridiculously expensive along with two dishes that Rio had never even heard of. The waiter promptly nodded, took their menus and left.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't have to do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head and smirked again. “Do what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Try to impress me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. Fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chewed on her freshly clipped nails.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is it working?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's working?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Impressing you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard and looked down to avoid eye contact. That was when she noticed that Agatha's blouse was open just enough to reveal the curve of her breasts. Not that she was staring at them. She just had a very good knowledge of female anatomy, and that's where the curve of one's breasts would be.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cleared her throat. “My eyes are up here, darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio looked back up, Agatha was smirking.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wasn't—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you like what you see?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was looking at your necklace.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. Rio looked back down, only to realize she wasn't wearing a necklace.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You
     <em>
      can
     </em>
     stare. I don't mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was saved by the waiter, who showed up carrying a bottle of wine. He served their glasses and left the bottle on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a hesitant sip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tastes expensive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio froze when she felt Agatha's foot slide up her leg through the slit of her dress.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I?” she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snorted. “You're asking if you can play footsie with me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well? Can I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was probably going to regret this, but she still shrugged and mumbled, “Suit yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and ran her foot further up. Rio's fingers trembled slightly around the stem of her glass, and Agatha looked like she was about to open her mouth to comment on it, but Rio was once again saved by their waiter. He placed their dishes in front of them and left without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had no idea what the fuck she was about to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha seemed to catch the hesitation, because she leaned forward slightly and pointed at the items on her plate.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is duck confit. The sauce over there is a mix of cherry and wine. And those are just regular baked potatoes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio still wasn't sure if she knew what it was, but she nodded just so Agatha would stop breathing so close to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a small bite and nodded approvingly. “It's good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Good? That's all I'm getting?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit back a smirk. “I'm not going to give you the satisfaction.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They ate the first half of their meals in a rather comfortable silence. Rio would occasionally catch Agatha stealing glances at her, and she could only hope that she was being more discreet than that when she did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So. Tell me more about yourself,” Agatha eventually said, propping her chin on her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You already know plenty. What else do you want to know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know about your career. I want to know about the basics. Where did you grow up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Salem, Massachusetts.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Witch country,” Agatha pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed. “Don't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Don't what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't ask stupid questions,” Rio said flatly. “No, we don't sacrifice goats. No, we don't learn witchcraft in school. And no, we definitely don't burn people at the stake. That's actually a European thing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Come on. I'm sure you indulged in some spooky bullshit at least once.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Some seancés here and there,” Rio admitted. “They didn't work, obviously.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tsked. “A shame. I would've had a few requests.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snorted. “Such as?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “My mother. Mostly to tell her to go fuck herself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio choked on her wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you alright, darling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just didn't expect you to have—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mommy issues?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded carefully. “Something like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha studied her for a while before leaning back in her chair. “Well, back to you. What made you get into fashion?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I always liked it. I'd shop at thrift stores a lot and alter the things I got there. We had, like, zero money growing up, so I had to work with whatever I could get,” Rio said quietly, poking at her food.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “By high school I was designing my own pieces from scratch. I used to consider it just a hobby, but then I started selling some of them at fairs around town and it became a full-time thing. Eventually, I started making so much money with it that it helped me pay my tuition.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why did you stop designing, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean, I didn't stop. It's just not my full-time thing anymore. I like styling just as much. It pays the bills.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What about your family?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed. “My dad died when I was seven. Work accident.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's gaze lingered, like she wanted to ask a question, but she didn't press further. Rio appreciated that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My mom had to work a lot to raise me and my siblings after that. I remember her working three jobs at once at some points. She wasn't around much, so I learned how to take care of myself and of my siblings very early.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Must've been hard for you,” Agatha said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was harder for her,” Rio said simply. “She sacrificed a lot for us. Wouldn't sleep. Wouldn't eat if we ran low on food. I'd just help my siblings with their homework and do some chores around the house.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And look at you now. Styling for Agatha Harkness. She must be really proud of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “Respectfully, Agatha, I really doubt that my mother knows who you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wow. I'm a little offended.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio laughed and shook her head. “She just doesn't care about Hollywood. She's more interested in the botanics channel.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed, amused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio quickly finished the rest of her meal and leaned back in her chair. “Can we discuss my raise now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Agatha said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Unbelievable,” Rio muttered under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned forward. “How about this? You keep working the way you've been working, and I'll revisit that request in a few months.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Why did you agree to discuss it, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We
     <em>
      are
     </em>
     discussing it, aren't we?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, yeah, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And because I wanted your company.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That was another thing Rio wasn't going to reply to.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “I'll even make the deal better. If you survive those few months without quitting, I'll take you to Paris.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She blinked. “Paris?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm. Fashion Week. Front row seats. The fanciest hotel you can think of. First class tickets. The works.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're joking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm dead serious.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you really that desperate to keep me around?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Darling, you have no idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That made Rio down the rest of her wine and stand up. She didn't trust herself not to bend Agatha over that table if she said anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cleared her throat. “Thanks for dinner.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reached for her hand. “My hotel is five minutes away.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you staying at a hotel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head. “You ask too many questions.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. “That's the first thing I asked all night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Second. You asked whose spirit I'd like to talk to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, enjoy your stay,” she said, her fingers twitching against Agatha's before she finally pulled her hand away.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha got up. “Does it change anything if I tell you that Ralph is out of the country and Nicky is at a friend's house?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed. She should go back home. This was a terrible idea.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and asked for the check. She paid without even looking at the total.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You could at least pretend to see how much it cost,” Rio muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have better things in my mind at the moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio mumbled something under her breath and walked past her. Agatha's driver was waiting outside of the car and immediately opened a door for them.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha signaled at her to get in first, which Rio was extremely grateful for, because she had no idea how much longer she could go without her knees buckling.
    </p>
    <p>
     The short drive to the hotel was a blur. The next thing she knew, Agatha's driver was already opening the door for them. Agatha slipped out first and extended her hand, and Rio hesitated briefly before taking it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her. “You know you don't have to come with me, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you want to go home, just tell me. My driver will take you there anytime.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and led Rio to the elevator, still holding onto her hand. She only let go of it to open her purse and fish for the keycard once they reached her room.
    </p>
    <p>
     The suite was unlike anything Rio had ever stayed in. She imagined that a one night stay there cost more than her rent. Maybe two months worth of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned against the door to remove her heels, watching as Agatha did the same from across the room. Her fingers twitched slightly. She couldn't believe she was actually doing this.
    </p>
    <p>
     Or well, actually, she did. She had, somehow, known from the second she met Agatha that she'd end up in bed with her. She just didn't want to admit it. Call it lesbian intuition or whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio walked further into the room and looked around. It was twice the size of her apartment, she guessed. She placed her phone on the table and turned to look at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My driver is still downstairs if you want to go home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean it,” Agatha said, walking over to her. “If you don't actually want to do anything, you can just tell me and he will take you home. If you want to stay here, we can just talk, drink, whatever you want. And if we end up, you know,” she said, gesturing vaguely, “and you change your mind, we'll stop any time. We're not going to do anything you don't want to—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cut her off by stepping forward and yanking her by the wrist, pulling her in for a rough, desperate kiss. Agatha gasped in surprise before melting into it, pushing Rio against the table, her fingers threading in her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     She smirked against her lips and pulled away just enough to murmur, “I knew you wanted this just as much as I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shut up,” Rio panted, wrapping her arms around Agatha's shoulder and pulling her in even closer, deepening the kiss further.
    </p>
    <p>
     But then, Rio's phone buzzed. And then again. And again. She groaned as she reluctantly attempted to pull away, breathless, but Agatha chased her, nipping at her bottom lip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just give me a second.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned against her skin, but refused to move away, choosing to trail wet, open-mouthed kisses down her neck instead. Rio tilted her head instinctively and reached for the phone behind her, almost dropping it when Agatha's hands slid around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Darling, I'm right here, and you're on your phone?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard when Agatha sucked on her pulse point.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha licked over the fresh bruise.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just give me a second, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed her neck one last time before pulling away with a dramatic sigh.

    <p>
     Rio swallowed when she looked up at her. Agatha smirked. For a second, she forgot what she was even supposed to be doing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Am I distracting you?” she teased.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her smirk widened when Rio gave her an unconvincing shake of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nosy friends,” Rio eventually managed. “Are you planning on me spending the night, or—”
    </p>

     “Do you want to spend the night?”

    <p>
     Rio licked her lips before nodding.

    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha plucked the phone from her hand, silenced it and threw it onto the chair next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do I have your undivided attention now?” she purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled Agatha closer again, kissing her even rougher than before, undoing the rest of the buttons and pushing the blouse off her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hands moved quickly to unclasp Agatha's bra, and she moaned at the sight of Agatha's bare chest when the fabric fell to the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Eager, darling?” Agatha asked, nipping at Rio's jaw, sighing softly when she tilted her head slightly to give her better access. “You were playing so hard to get a few minutes ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio responded by pushing Agatha's slacks down as quickly as she could. Agatha kicked them off to the corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached for the zipper of her own dress, but Agatha stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me,” she said, circling around Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushed her hair over one shoulder and trailed soft, warm kisses down her neck before pulling the zipper down, letting the dress fall and pool at Rio's feet.
    </p>
    <p>
     She circled back around and took a few steps back. “God, you're beautiful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't give Rio time to respond before she spun them around and kissed her again, walking her backwards toward the bed until the back of Rio's knees hit the mattress. Her breath hitched when Agatha climbed over her, and the tiny part of her brain that made her feel guilty almost made her push Agatha off of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you still sure?” Agatha asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio managed a weak nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll need more than that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio squeezed her eyes shut. “Yes, Agatha, I still want you to fuck me. Even more than I did five minutes ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That answer more than satisfied her, and Agatha leaned down to kiss her hard. Rio moaned into her mouth when Agatha slotted a knee between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can't believe you made me wait this long. You've been driving me insane for a whole month,” Agatha muttered against her skin, her lips trailing down to the swell of Rio's breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gasped when Agatha took a nipple into her mouth. “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed around it, swirling her tongue in slow circles, before releasing it and moving to her other breast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was already panting heavily by the time Agatha finally moved lower. She inhaled sharply when she felt Agatha cup her through her panties.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so fucking wet. Have you been like this all night, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard and nodded when Agatha looked up at her. Agatha nuzzled into her inner thighs, smirking against her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hold my hair back for me,” she purred, spreading Rio's legs wider and pressing her hands down on her thighs to keep her still.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio reached for it with trembling hands and fisted it. Agatha hummed and pulled her underwear off, tossing it somewhere behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha split her soaked folds with her nose, inhaling deep enough to make Rio whine above her. “Fuck, you smell so good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushed against Agatha's hands and tilted her hips up slightly. “Agatha, please, will you just—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took advantage of the new angle to lick a slow stripe up Rio's slit. She moaned at the taste and tightened her grip on Rio's thighs when her hips bucked hard against her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gasped, digging her nails into Agatha's scalp so hard that it had to hurt. Agatha didn't seem to care.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You taste so much better than I imagined,” she purred. “And I've imagined it a lot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You—you have?” Rio managed, attempting to roll her hips against Agatha's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed, the vibration making Rio shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, fuck, you—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, yes. Say my name like that again,” Agatha rasped between licks.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha—” she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned. “Fuck, I love how you sound.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She flattened her tongue against Rio's clit before taking it into her mouth. Rio fisted Agatha's hair tighter in response, but she didn't pull. Agatha leaned against her touch and gave her a small nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tugged lightly, pulling Agatha's head back a little before pushing her back into her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can pull harder than that, darling,” Agatha murmured. She licked back down to Rio's entrance and pressed her tongue firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whimpered, tugging harder this time, pulling Agatha where she wanted her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned at the pull, her nails digging into Rio's thighs. “Fuck, yes, just like that. Do it again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obeyed, and Agatha rewarded her by sucking harder on her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha—please, please, please, I'm so fucking close, please don't stop,” Rio whined, her breath having turned into short and frantic gasps.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled away just enough to whisper, “I got you, darling. Come for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned back in, her tongue splitting Rio's folds with a firm swipe, dragging back up to her clit and flicking it relentlessly, and Rio came harder than she had in a few years, or maybe in her whole life. Most likely the latter. Her grip on Agatha's hair tightened hard enough to make her whine into her, the vibration making Rio jolt hard against her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept licking her through it, groaning at the feeling of Rio pulsing under her tongue, only pulling away when even the smallest, lightest pass of her tongue made Rio whimper in overstimulation. She pressed one last wet, open-mouthed kiss to her clit before kissing softly along Rio's trembling thighs. Rio's grip on her hair eventually loosened, and she surged up, kissing her roughly, letting Rio taste herself on her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're even prettier when you come,” Agatha purred against her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     It only took her a few seconds to slip a hand between them and begin to rub slow, tight circles over Rio's clit, groaning when Rio moaned into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swallowed hard before managing a whiny, “Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me be on top.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled away to take a better look at her, smirking when Rio chased her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed Rio one last time before climbing off of her and settling against the headboard, spreading her legs slightly. “Come here. Take what you need, darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio crawled up to her immediately and straddled her thigh, grinding down a few times, testing the friction. Agatha grabbed her face and kissed her hard as she flexed her thigh, making Rio moan into her mouth and grind down harder before blindly reaching for her wrist. She lifted her hips just enough to guide Agatha's hand between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let Agatha regain control then, exhaling shakily when she dragged her fingers from her entrance to her clit, rubbing it in small, light circles. Rio instinctively rolled her hips against her hand, and Agatha rewarded her by pushing two fingers deep into her, groaning at how tight and wet and hot Rio was around her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, you're squeezing me so tight already,” Agatha rasped. “You feel so fucking good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio buried her face in Agatha's shoulder, gasping against her skin as Agatha began to pick up her pace slightly. She moaned something unintelligible, and Agatha tugged at her hair, pulling her head back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard. “I said, please, Agatha—harder, faster, I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pressed an open-mouthed kiss to her jaw. “That's all you had to say, darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She twisted her wrist slightly a few times, curling her fingers each time, searching, until she found a spot that made Rio practically scream into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and pumped her fingers into that spot relentlessly. “Right here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio responded by yanking hard at Agatha's hair, and Agatha rewarded her by fucking her fingers faster into her. Rio pulled harder, and Agatha pressed her palm against Rio's clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She buried her face in the crook of Agatha's neck as she came, planting wet, open-mouthed kisses there in between pants. Agatha kept moving her fingers slowly, helping Rio ride it out until Rio swatted weakly at her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once her breathing had evened out a little, Rio looked up at Agatha. “Let me make you come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You want to fuck me, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded frantically. “So bad.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and brushed a wet strand of hair out of Rio's face. “Where do you want me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I owe you a favor. I'll do whatever you want, darling. Just tell me where you want me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard. She wasn't expecting Agatha to just give her control like that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “So?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sit at the edge of the bed,” Rio finally said, climbing off of her and sitting back on her heels.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha obeyed, moving toward the edge and parting her legs just enough. She looked over her shoulder. “Like this?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips and nodded. “Yeah. Just like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And are you just going to sit there?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at her for a while longer before shaking her head and sliding off the bed. She quickly put her hair up into a bun and kneeled between Agatha's legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's mouth watered when she saw the dark patch in Agatha's panties. She leaned in and moaned as she licked a stripe over Agatha's damp underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck,” Rio whined. “You're so wet. All for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed and spread her legs a little wider.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hooked her fingers into the waistband of her panties, but Agatha grabbed her wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah-ah,” she tutted.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked up at her, confused. “But I thought—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Ask nicely.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She whined and leaned in again, nuzzling into Agatha's inner thigh, trailing wet, open-mouthed kisses up to the ruined fabric, moaning softly between each one. “Can I
     <em>
      please
     </em>
     take these off?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignored her question and ran her thumb over Rio's lower lip. “Fuck, you're literally drooling. God, that's so fucking hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head slightly and pressed a kiss to Agatha's thumb before taking it into her mouth, keeping her eyes firm on Agatha's as she sucked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed contentedly, her nails scraping lightly against Rio's scalp. She let Rio suck on her thumb for a while longer before pulling it free with a wet pop, smirking at how Rio whined at the loss. She tilted Rio's chin up with two fingers before lifting her own hips slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on, darling,” she purred. “Take them off. I'm all yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't hesitate, immediately pulling the fabric down in one quick motion, watching as Agatha kicked it off to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned so loud that it made Agatha shiver. She licked another long stripe, now over bare skin, and whimpered against Agatha's cunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck,” she gasped. “You taste so fucking good, I could stay here forever, I
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to stay here forever—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha almost came from the desperation in Rio's voice alone. She tightened her grip on Rio's hair and pushed her further into her. Rio moaned loudly into her in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, Rio, I can feel you moaning into me,” Agatha groaned, grinding harder against her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned even louder at that and slid her tongue from Agatha's entrance up to her clit before taking it into her mouth and sucking hard. Agatha tightened her grip on her hair again, making her whine softly against her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She slid a hand from Agatha's thigh to her entrance and pulled away to look up at her. “Can I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's breath stuttered. “Fuck, do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned and pressed two fingers inside, immediately down to the last knuckle. She groaned when she felt Agatha clench around her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, I need to make you come so fucking bad—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushed her back between her legs and held her there as she began to grind down hard into her mouth. Rio began to thrust faster in response, curling her fingers every time she pumped them back in until Agatha came hard around her fingers, pushing Rio further into her and holding her there as she rode it out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gasped for air when Agatha finally eased her grip on her hair. She pressed her forehead to Agatha's knee, panting heavily, her lips slick and swollen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a breathless chuckle, her thighs still twitching slightly. “Well, fuck. You're—
     <em>
      wow
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rested her head for a while longer before kissing the inside of Agatha's knee and pulling away just enough to murmur, “Can I clean you up? Please?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She tilted her head and ran a thumb over Rio's dripping chin. “Since you're asking so nicely…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed contentedly as Rio dove back in, kissing a trail up her inner thigh before lapping up the slickness with her tongue, still hot and wet.
    </p>
    <p>
     She threaded her fingers lazily through Rio's hair. “You'd do this all night if I let you, wouldn't you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and licked a long stripe up her thigh, moaning at the taste of the wetness she found there. “Mm-hmm. Please. You taste so fucking good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed Agatha's thigh one last time, whining softly against it, before running her tongue through Agatha's soaked folds again. She hissed from the overstimulation, her grip on Rio's hair tightening again, pulling her head away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't know when to stop, do you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips and shook her head. “I want to make you come again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed, considering. “Mm. And why is that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because you made me come twice,” she breathed. “It's only fair if I return the favor.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She dragged her nails lightly against Rio's scalp. “Get up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Up,” Agatha repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whined softly before trailing wet kisses up Agatha's inner thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now, Rio,” Agatha ordered, punctuated by another tug in her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pouted but finally relented, standing up on shaky legs, her thighs slick.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Come here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio immediately climbed onto Agatha's lap and straddled her thigh, moaning at the friction against her swollen clit when she rolled her hips in small circles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you trying to start something again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio buried her face in Agatha's shoulder and chuckled. “Maybe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed the side of her head and slid her hands down to Rio's ass, squeezing it before she began to guide her movements.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you like it?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did I
     <em>
      like
     </em>
     it? I was about to ask if you're sure you're not some kind of sex witch.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled between moans. “Do I have you under my spell, Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Completely,” Agatha purred, guiding Rio down harder.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time they both collapsed onto the mattress hours later, their bodies soaked with sweat and their thighs coated in slick, Rio was surprised by how the bed hadn't broken under them. If she were to keep fucking Agatha, and were to one day have her come to her apartment, it'd probably be smart to invest in a bed that durable. She quickly shook that thought off. Not happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, Agatha, that was—” She closed her eyes as she tried to remember how to breathe. “Holy shit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled onto her side and propped herself up on her elbow. “Are you alright, darling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a breathless laugh. “Yeah. Just—fuck, I haven't gone non-stop like this since college.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and ran her nails lightly over Rio's stomach. “Mm. So what you're saying is that I fucked you better than anyone has in years?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “Don't flatter yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed her shoulder. “Do you need anything? Food? Water?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Water.
     <em>
      Desperately
     </em>
     . Jesus Christ, I feel like I just ran three marathons.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed and pressed a lingering kiss to her lips before getting up and padding to the minifridge.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How the fuck are you even standing right now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Magic.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned her head slightly and licked her lips at the sight of Agatha's bare body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Admiring the view?” Agatha asked, glancing over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and smirked lazily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha walked back to the bed and sat next to Rio, twisting open the cap. “Here. Sit up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's arms twitched as she pushed herself up. Agatha held the bottle to her lips, and she drank greedily, the freezing cold water making her sigh contentedly. A few stray drops dribbled down her chin, and Agatha was quick to wipe them away with her thumb. She gently pushed at Agatha's hand once she was satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Holy shit, that felt good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and took a few sips before setting the bottle down on the nightstand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I run you a shower?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snorted. “What's this? Aftercare?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If that's what you want to call it. But you look like you need it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flopped back onto the pillows. “No. Too tired.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ran a hand through Rio's damp hair. “Can I at least clean you up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked up at her before nodding slowly. “Yeah. That'd be nice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She slipped out of bed again and returned from the bathroom carrying a damp towel.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hissed as soon as Agatha touched her with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so sensitive,” Agatha cooed, softening her touch, though it didn't do much.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah, no shit,” Rio snapped. “Fuck, I hate this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I remember you being the one who begged for another round. Like five times.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It was a joint decision!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed the corner of her mouth and tossed the towel aside when she finished.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll take a quick shower. Unlike you, I have standards.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio huffed a laugh and buried herself into her pillow. She was passed out before Agatha could even close the bathroom door.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio woke up, she felt like she had fallen down a hundred flights of stairs and then proceeded to be run over by a gang of elephants driving monster trucks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was already awake, nursing a cup of coffee at the table by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning, darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stretched weakly and winced. “What time is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Late.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grumbled something under her breath. She didn't even want to think about looking at the messages Alice and Jen had undoubtedly sent her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come here. I ordered us breakfast.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stalled in bed for a while longer, too sore to move a muscle, before finally getting up. Agatha threw a robe in her direction and she put it on without much thought, tying it lightly around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat down in front of Agatha, her eyes widening at the amount of food she had ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cleared her throat and took a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and slid it across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's that?” Rio asked as she chewed on a croissant.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rules.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow as she took it. “Is this some Fifty Shades of Grey shit?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned back in her chair and smirked. “Only if you want it to be.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed and unfolded it.
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      No sex at my house.
     </li>
     <li>
      No marking me anywhere.
     </li>
     <li>
      Around other people, you're just my stylist.
     </li>
     <li>
      No asking me to leave my husband for you. I won't.
     </li>
     <li>
      No unplanned visits.
     </li>
     <li>
      If this reaches the media, you're going down with me.
     </li>
     <li>
      No asking what this is.
     </li>
     <li>
      No jealousy.
     </li>
     <li>
      No falling in love.
     </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
     These were all pretty obvious, Rio thought. The last rule, however, was circled and underlined in bright red.
     <em>
      Multiple times
     </em>
     . Right.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled and gave the paper back to her. “Cute. But it won't happen again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact Agatha had her bent over that table ten minutes didn't count, Rio told herself. The quickie in the shower also
     <em>
      absolutely
     </em>
     didn't count.
    </p>
    <p>
     Almost an hour later, Rio was finally getting dressed. Every little movement made her wince, her body sore in places she didn't even know existed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can I be medically excused from work today?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “I guess I can make an exception. I'll need you tomorrow, though.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and sat at the edge of the bed to put on her heels. Agatha sat next to her and held out the piece of paper again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need you to take this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because we both know that this will keep happening, and I need you to be able to follow the rules.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled under her breath. “It won't—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slid a foot up Rio's calf, and she froze. “You don't seem so sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed and reluctantly took the piece of paper. “This doesn't mean it will happen again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course it doesn't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She finished adjusting the strap of her heels and stood up, wincing when she put her full weight on her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha watched as she walked toward the door. She got up as soon as Rio reached for the handle and crossed the room in quick strides.
    </p>
    <p>
     She spun Rio around. “Aren't you going to give me a goodbye kiss?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow and chuckled. “Didn't know you wanted it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She rolled her eyes and pressed a lingering kiss to her lips. Agatha was quick to thread her fingers into her hair and deepen it, smirking when Rio sighed contentedly into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     She let Agatha push her against the door for a few seconds before pulling away. “I should go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded and stepped away, watching as Rio opened the door just enough to be able to slip into the hallway.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Te veo.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She waited until she was a safe distance away from the door to bury her face in her hands and scream. She was definitely fucked.
    </p>
    <p>
     As was to be expected, Alice and Jen pounced like two rabid vultures the second she stepped into the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen immediately held out her hand. “I want my ten dollars back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Absolutely not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She padded into the kitchen and grabbed a bottle of water from the fridge, downing half of it in a few gulps.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. Spill,” Alice said. “How good was it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio dropped onto the couch. “It was the best sex of my life good, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Better than—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on. Details,” Jen demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     She'd normally be a little freaked out about how interested they were in her sex life, but she was admittedly still a little too dazed to care.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's, like, insanely good at non-stop. Don't even get me started on her mouth. I don't even know how many times I came, I just—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We've heard enough, thank you,” Alice cut in. “The important question is, when are you seeing her again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen scoffed. “Right. You just had the best sex of your life, and you're never doing it with her again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Exactly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Riiiiight
     </em>
     ,” they said in unison.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'd really appreciate it if you could be more supportive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We are being supportive of your rights to get fucked by an insanely hot woman.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not what I meant,” Rio groaned. “Can you please have some faith in me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Again, in unison, “Nope.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean it. I feel guilty as fuck already.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice snorted. “For what? Not making her come enough times?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen burst out laughing and punched Alice lightly in the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “GOD, FUCK YOU GUYS!”
    </p>
    <p>
     She flipped them off and stormed toward her room, slamming the door behind her for good measure. She loved them more than anything in the world (well, maybe a little less than she loved getting fucked by Agatha and fucking Agatha), but sometimes they made her wish she had dropped out of school during kindergarten.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Work the following day was absolute hell. Her mind was ruined. She could no longer look at Agatha Harkness without thinking of her mouth and her hands and the way she made Rio come and the way Rio made her come. Maybe this was the perfect time to finally send in her two-week notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead, by the time she was finished with her work for the day, she had forgotten all about wanting to quit, and all she wanted was for Ralph to get lost at sea so that Agatha could marry her instead without having to go through the process of divorce.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you free tonight?” Agatha asked as Rio was packing her things.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “And what will a busy girl like you be doing on a Wednesday night?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A busy girl like me will hopefully be doing her boss.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “When can my driver pick you up?”
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha no longer held back from touching and flirting with her. Not like she ever did. Rio didn't either. Obviously, things were different whenever Ralph was around. Just like rule three said, she was just her stylist then. Rio didn't really mind at first — the sex was really good, and she didn't hide the fact that she counted down the hours to meet Agatha outside of work whenever Ralph was out of town, but that was all it was.
    </p>
    <p>
     She found all the rules pretty simple to follow. As time went on, however, their meetings became more frequent, and by the second month, Agatha began evading Ralph when he was home so that she could spend a few hours with Rio at a hotel. By the third month, she'd occasionally spend the night even when Ralph wasn't traveling. She never told Rio what she'd tell him, and Rio didn't care enough to ask.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the fourth month, however, Rio felt like she was starting to break the most important rule. It was really hard not to fall in love with Agatha Harkness when she fucked Rio the way that she did and took care of her afterwards the way that she did. It wasn't like Agatha ever had to find out, though. Rio knew that it wouldn't change anything — or worse, it'd get her fired. She just had to tell herself a few dozen times a day that she didn't want Agatha to leave Ralph for her, and she'd be fine. Mostly.

    <p>
     When month five rolled around, Agatha crossed a line.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      12:53pm

    </p>

     <em>
      Great. Will be there in 5.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's stomach flipped. She spent a few minutes pacing around her room and screamed into her pillow before replying.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      12:57pm
     </strong>

      12:57pm
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      okay
     </em>
    </p>

     <strong>
      12:57pm
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I'm going to your place to fuck you and all you have to say is “okay”?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't have time to reply before her doorbell rang. She tossed her phone onto the nightstand and took a quick glance at herself in the mirror. She was only wearing an oversized Snoopy shirt that barely covered her black lace panties. She considered changing, but then again, Agatha would have them off the second she walked through the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha walked in as soon as she opened the door, barely glancing around Rio's apartment before she turned her gaze back to her and smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that what my stylist wears when I'm not around?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio crossed her arms. “Well, I wasn't really expecting company, but you invited yourself over, so—”
    </p>
    <p>
     That made Agatha trap her against the wall and kiss her hard. She smirked against her lips when Rio gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Missed your mouth,” Agatha murmured between kisses.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled against her lips. “You had my mouth two nights ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Exactly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slotted a thigh between Rio's legs and lifted it just enough to make Rio moan into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio whined, already shifting her hips slightly to get more pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slid a hand down and squeezed Rio's ass under her shirt and pressed her thigh a little harder. “I love when you say my name like that. Say it again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, not here,” she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignored her and kissed her harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled away and whimpered. “Agatha—bedroom. My roommates—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “They're not here,” Agatha countered, biting down on her jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lowered her thigh and pressed a hand between Rio's legs instead, and she moaned way too loud for someone who was saying no to being fucked right here, right now.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want me to stop?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes.
     <em>
      No
     </em>
     . Fuck, Agatha, bedroom.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned. “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Apartment rules,” Rio panted. “I mean it, Agatha. Bedroom.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You just made that up,” Agatha said, pulling Rio's panties a little to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swatted at her hand and nodded toward a board on the wall. Agatha scanned it. There were multiple rules, but the first one, written in bright red ink and surrounded by exclamation marks, said “
     <strong>
      NO SEX IN SHARED SPACES (THIS MEANS YOU, RIO!!!)
     </strong>
     ”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scoffed. “This is ridiculous.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn't make the rules.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and bent down to lift her effortlessly. Rio yelped, her legs instinctively wrapping around Agatha's waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, you're strong,” Rio purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm. Do you like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio responded by rolling her hips against Agatha's stomach. She smirked when Agatha groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where's your room?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Second door to the left,” Rio rasped, tilting Agatha's head up to kiss her deeply, moaning into her mouth when she rolled her hips onto her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     They knocked a few things over on their way to Rio's bedroom, but she'd take care of that later. Agatha kicked the door closed behind them and set Rio down on the bed before crawling over her, caging her under her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You love driving me crazy, don't you?” she rasped, leaning down and trailing wet, open-mouthed kisses along her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” Rio panted, tilting her head slightly to give Agatha better access to her pulse point.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm. I love it when you lose control. When you get like this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned and sat up just enough to yank her own shirt over her head and to unclasp her bra, tossing both behind her. Before she could lean back down, however, her eyes caught a small movement on the corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the fuck is that?” Agatha growled, climbing off of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned at the loss. “What are you talking about?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That thing.” Agatha pointed at the glass enclosure at the corner of the room. “Is that a fucking spider?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio propped herself up on her elbows. “Don't call her a
     <em>
      thing
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, what the fuck? Why do you have a spider in your room?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. “She's my pet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not a pet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A pet is like… a dog. Or a cat. Or a bunny. That's a demon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “When God sings with his creations, will a spider not be part of the choir?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you even going on about?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled and rolled out of bed. “Fuck, I forgot that you're like, ancient. It's a meme. Have you ever even heard of those?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is that supposed to mean?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes before she walked to the enclosure and tapped on the glass, smiling when the spider immediately moved toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It
     <em>
      knows
     </em>
     you. What the fuck?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes narrowed. “Yeah? Because she's my tarantula and I take care of her every day?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do not like that. At all.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio ignored her. “Her name is Victoria. Wanna hold her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? No. And why the fuck does your spider have a name?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned. “Did you come here to fuck me or to bully my pet?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     going to fuck you with four pairs of eyes staring at me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can assure you that she's very used to women in my bed and doesn't mind—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     mind,” Agatha said flatly. “Cover the cage or I'm leaving.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cover. The. Fucking. Cage.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Okay, okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She tugged her shirt off and draped it over the enclosure before pulling her panties down and stepping out of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Happy now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked as Agatha tugged her back toward the bed and pushed her onto it, immediately climbing over her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Off,” Rio breathed, pushing blindly at Agatha's slacks.
    </p>
    <p>
     She smirked into Rio's mouth and pulled them down along with her panties, kicking them both aside.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where were we?” she asked, running a hand down Rio's stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip and tilted her hips up slightly. “I think you were about to fuck me with your fingers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is that so?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm. And with your mouth, too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm, that sounds about right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pushed two fingers down to the last knuckle and pressed her thumb to Rio's clit, circling it tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is this what you wanted?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded frantically and kissed her hard before moving a hand down to Agatha's wrist and clawing at it, coaxing her to fuck her faster, already clenching hard around her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you going to come for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whimpered. “Fuck, yes, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow and slowed her movements a little. “But?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want your mouth too. I need your mouth. Please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Greedy,” Agatha purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded frantically. “Always.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned. She kept her fingers pumping steadily into her as she slid down her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     She quickly replaced her thumb with her tongue and sucked hard on Rio's clit, sending her almost immediately over the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed her jaw as soon as Agatha climbed back up her body and licked a slow, hot stripe from her chin to her lips, gathering her own slickness and moaning at the taste.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, you're so hot,” Agatha groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled against her lips before kissing her hard again. She pressed one last wet kiss to Agatha's jaw before pulling away just enough to murmur, “Second drawer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?” Agatha asked, chasing her lips. She groaned in frustration when Rio turned her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Second drawer,” she said again, pointing lazily to the nightstand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tilted her head, but her breath caught when the realization dawned on her a second later. Rio smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck,” she groaned, scrambling off of her and yanking the drawer open.
    </p>
    <p>
     She moaned low in her throat as she grabbed the vibrator that sat on the back of the drawer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip and twirled a strand of hair around her finger. “What do you think of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha immediately climbed over Rio again and flicked the toy on. She trailed it down Rio's stomach and kissed her hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you think about me when you fuck yourself with this, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio barely had time to register her door swinging open.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, did you see my texts—OH MY FUCKING GOD.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio screamed and yanked the blanket over them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “ALICE, WHAT THE FUCK? GET OUT!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shrieked and slapped her hands over her eyes. “OH MY GOD, WHY ME?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “GET OUT, GET OUT, GET OUT!”
    </p>
    <p>
     The door slammed shut again. Rio's room was quiet for a while, until Agatha began shaking with laughter under the covers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, that's a nice introduction to your friend,” Agatha snorted, pulling the blanket off of them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This isn't funny,” Rio snapped. “I live with her. She's never going to let me forget about this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed her neck. “Well, I'd hope you won't forget about the first time you let me fuck you with your vibrator.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She groaned and swatted at her weakly before taking the vibrator from her hand and flicking it off, tossing it beside her. “That ruined the mood.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clicked her tongue. “I disagree,” she said as she got up and went to lock the door. “Now, where were we?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a breathless laugh. “Are you serious?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very,” Agatha purred, already climbing on top of her again and grabbing the vibrator. “You still haven't answered my question.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's breath hitched when Agatha flicked the toy back on.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swallowed hard. “What question?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you think about me when you fuck yourself with this?” Agatha asked, running the toy over Rio's thighs and pressing down just enough to make her breath hitch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “When?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned and tried to push at Agatha's hand to lead her where she wanted her. “Many times. Will you just fuck me already?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clicked her tongue and pulled the toy away completely. “Not what I want to hear.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, fuck, will you
     <em>
      please
     </em>
     just fuck me already?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not that. Tell me when.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told you. Multiple times. Stop teasing me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head. “Multiple times, such as?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, Rio. You started this. Finish it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard. “The night after my interview.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow and pressed the toy lightly against Rio's clit, groaning when she shuddered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on,” she coaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I made myself come twice just from thinking about what your fingers would feel like inside me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pressed the toy down harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio choked out a moan. “After watching one of your movies once.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Which one?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't even know what movie it was. It's just—fuck, just watching you made me so fucking wet that I had to pause it and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned and began to move the vibrator in small circles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “After the first time we fucked. God, Agatha, I was so fucking sore, but I couldn't stop thinking about you, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha set the toy to a higher setting. “Only after the first time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head frantically, rolling her hips into the toy. “Every time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you moan my name while you fuck yourself, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could only manage another frantic nod, and Agatha flicked the toy up to a higher setting again and pressed it down harder against her clit. Her moans mixed with Rio's as she came hard, her entire body shuddering under Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clicked the vibrator off and tossed it aside before climbing up Rio's body and kissing her roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sit up,” Agatha growled. “Fingers inside me. Now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't normally tease, but she figured that a little teasing would be enough punishment for Agatha having laughed at her for getting walked in on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked, pushing herself up. “Did you get that worked up just from fucking me with my vibrator?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio. Fingers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say please,” she cooed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please—” She cut herself off with a groan. “No, fuck that. I'm not begging. You're going to fuck me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed as she ran her fingers through Agatha's folds. “That still sounds a little bit like begging.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please, you fucking asshole—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled her hand away and raised an eyebrow. “Now that's not very nice, is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I swear to God, if you don't fuck me right now, I'll tie you to this bed and ride your face until you pass out and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned. Now those were two things that they hadn't tried yet. Or three, depending on how you look at it. She pushed two fingers down to the last knuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, finally,” Agatha moaned, her nails digging deep into Rio's shoulders as she ground down shamelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm, I think I'd actually be into that, though,” she purred, sliding her free hand up to Agatha's hips to guide her in sync with her slow thrusts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned down to kiss her hard, gasping into her mouth when Rio curled her fingers. “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled against her lips. “Mm-hmm. I wouldn't mind you fucking me unconscious.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned and moved a hand to Rio's wrist, digging her nails hard into her skin. Rio started to fuck her faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip. “Do you have any idea how hot you look right now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grinned and kissed her again. “And do you have any idea what making you come does to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew, but she wanted to hear Agatha say it, so she shook her head. “Mm, no idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It drives me fucking insane, Rio. The way you moan my name, the way you squeeze around my fingers, the way you come. Fuck, Rio, I can never get enough of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned so pathetically that she knew that if Alice and Jen heard it, which they probably did, they'd never let her forget about it. Whatever. A part of her hoped that Agatha would be divorcing Ralph soon enough and Rio would be able to move in with her. She pressed her thumb against Agatha's clit and rubbed it in small circles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think about you all the time, you know that?” Agatha panted, fighting against Rio's grip and rolling her hips faster. “When I'm supposed to be focusing on a script, when I'm having dinner with my fucking husband—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned and curled her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It gets me so worked up that I have to fuck myself pretending it's you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whimpered. “How?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “My fingers. Toys. I just—fuck, I just keep thinking about your fingers, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Only my fingers?” she asked, punctuated by a few harder thrusts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And your fucking mouth. You know that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned at that and replaced her thumb with her palm, grinding hard against Agatha's clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha could no longer think clearly enough to form words anymore. Rio twisted her wrist slightly and curled her fingers into Agatha's favorite spot and added a third finger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sobbed into Rio's shoulder as she came hard around her fingers, her breathless moans muffled by Rio's warm skin. Rio kept fucking her through it until Agatha weakly pushed at her hand, her face still buried in Rio's shoulder as she panted heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, Rio, you're something else,” she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip and ran a hand over Agatha's spine as her breathing began to even out a little. “So… about tying me up…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let out a breathless chuckle and finally raised her head just enough to look at her. “What about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'd love to try that. Right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cursed under her breath and nipped at her jaw. “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm.” Rio grinned and tilted her head slightly to give Agatha more access. She nodded toward her wardrobe. “I keep my belts in the fourth drawer. Left door.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned low in her throat before she got out of bed. “Slut.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yours,” Rio admitted, licking her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Maybe it was too early for that, but Rio was way too turned on for her brain to function properly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha glanced over her shoulder and raised an eyebrow. “Is that so?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, smirking when Agatha climbed over her again, now carrying two belts. “Haven't fucked anyone else since the day I met you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze. For a second, Rio thought she might have gone too far.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swallowed hard and grabbed Rio's wrists. “Say that again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips. “I haven't fucked anyone else since the day I met you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha growled and kissed her hard, fumbling blindly with the belt as she tied one of Rio's wrists to the headboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're mine,” Agatha snarled against her lips. “You belong to me, you understand?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded frantically, moaning as Agatha quickly tied her other wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yours, Agatha,” she whimpered. “All yours. Only yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sucked hard on her lower lip one last time before moving one hand to the headboard to support herself. Her thighs trembled as she shifted to straddle Rio's face, her free hand fisting her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pressed her tongue against her the second that Agatha lowered herself into her mouth, sucking her clit greedily, making Agatha's head slump forward against the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, Rio, your fucking mouth, you—” She cut herself off with a sharp gasp, her thighs trembling hard around Rio's head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her grip on the headboard tightened until her knuckles turned white and she began to grind down harder into Rio's mouth, her moans turning into helpless sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio doubled down at the feeling, flicking her clit relentlessly, her own ragged moans vibrating into her, until Agatha came hard, soaking her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     They quickly lost track of time after that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I tap—fuck, I tap out,” Rio eventually gasped, tugging at the restraints. “Fuck. Enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was panting so heavily that she coughed a little. “Jesus Christ. If I knew that giving you my vibrator would make you fuck me like that, I would've invited you over sooner.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slid down her body and laughed breathlessly against her skin and kissed her collarbone before sitting up just enough to undo the belts tying Rio's wrists to the headboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio winced and flexed her fingers as soon as she was freed from the restraints.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyebrows furrowed when she saw the marks on Rio's wrists. Some of them would surely bruise.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Shit, Rio, I'm so sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked up at her. She still felt a little lightheaded. “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She cradled Rio's wrists carefully. “I didn't mean to hurt you. I shouldn't have tied you this tightly. I'm sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled. “Agatha, it's fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, it's not. Why didn't you tell me that this was hurting you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You didn't hurt me. I liked it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure it doesn't hurt?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded lazily. “Mm-hmm. You took care of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, Agatha kissed her wrists a few times. “You're such a good girl for me, Rio. I can't believe you let me do that to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed contentedly and sunk further into the mattress.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want me to get you some water?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head. “Can you just stay with me for a while?” she asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course I can,” Agatha replied, pulling Rio closer to her and letting her nuzzle into her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's “little while” turned into a few hours. She was passed out next to Agatha, having completely forgotten that Ralph existed, when she was awoken by the sound of Agatha's alarm ringing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned as she reached over to turn it off. “I have to go. Ralph will be home with Nicky soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her stomach twisted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay,” Rio whispered, barely audible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed and ran her hands through her face before getting up to gather her clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're awfully quiet,” Agatha said, glancing over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know that I'm not much of a talker after sex.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not what this is, though.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't reply. She pulled the blanket over her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha walked up to her and pulled the blanket down just enough to look her in the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You knew what this was,” Agatha said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed and shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have the day off tomorrow, by the way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I had the day off today, you don't have to give me another one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed. “Ralph wants to take me somewhere to make up for how much he's been traveling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's stomach twisted even worse than before.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Great.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's okay, Agatha. You don't have to explain yourself to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha brushed a strand of hair out of Rio's face. “I don't really want to go, but you know how it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't bite back a small smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     just cancel and spend the day with me instead.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted. “Yeah, I'm going to tell my husband that I can't go out with him because I'd rather be fucking my stylist senseless.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked lazily. “You
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     tell him that. Just soften the wording a little bit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Or,” Rio mused. “You could just lie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll think about it, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio knew that that meant no, but she didn't press further. Agatha kissed her one last time before heading toward the door and unlocking it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait,” Rio said, slipping out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, I really have to go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just one last thing before you go.” She uncovered Victoria's enclosure and slipped her shirt back on. “Hold her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No fucking way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio batted her eyelashes. “Please. She's harmless.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you make every woman that you get in your bed hold your creepy pet?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed as she opened the enclosure. “She's not creepy. And no, that's restricted to my insanely hot boss.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Flattery won't make me hold her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You will hold her, though. Unless you don't want to fuck me again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grumbled under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sit,” Rio said, pointing to her bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why do I have a feeling this is some scheme to convince me to go for another round?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Would you complain if it was?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't dignify that with a response. She grumbled again as she sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio coaxed Victoria into her hand and walked up to her, who reluctantly held up her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “See? There you go,” she cooed, placing Victoria on Agatha's trembling palm.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's… very still. I don't like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's watching you,” Rio pointed out, sitting next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's very comforting, Rio. Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Talk to her. Say something nice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're making me question why I fuck you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, that's not very nice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned. “She has… nice legs. And eyes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned and nodded excitedly. “I know!”
    </p>
    <p>
     She rolled her eyes and attempted to hand Victoria back, but Rio scooted away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. You still have to apologize.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For calling her a thing. And for making me cover her home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “Covering her home was clearly doing her a favor.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed. “Fine. Sorry for calling you a thing. And for making Rio cover your creepy, spidery home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gasped dramatically. “Apologize again. Her home isn't creepy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry for calling your
     <em>
      lovely
     </em>
     home creepy. Are you happy now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Very,” Rio said, finally scooping Victoria out of her hand. She kissed the corner of Agatha's mouth before getting up and placing Victoria back in her enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so lucky you're hot,” Agatha said as she got up. She walked toward Rio and wrapped her arms around her waist before spinning her around and kissing her hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pressed one last kiss to Rio's lips before pulling away completely. “I'll see you on Wednesday, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio forced a smile as she nodded. “Te veo.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She collapsed back onto her bed as soon as the door clicked shut behind Agatha. She was so,
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     fucked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed her phone from the nightstand and lazily checked her notifications. Alice had texted her multiple times a few hours earlier. Those were the texts that she was talking about when she traumatized herself forever, Rio guessed. She chuckled under her breath and put her phone aside. She fell back asleep before she could even think about doing anything else. The soft buzz of her phone next to her woke her up a while later.

     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     A few hours, a long shower and a box of frozen pizza later, Rio still hadn't slept. Her fingers hovered over her phone for a long while before she typed,
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      12:32am
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha read the message immediately, but didn't text back. A few more minutes passed in agonizing silence. Just as Rio was about to send another message apologizing for it, a reply came through.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>

     <em>
      good night, agatha

     <em>
      good night, cariño
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She fell asleep quickly after that.
    </p>
    <p>
     The following morning, Rio was awoken by the dull thud of something hitting her in the back. And then another.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mail for you, pornstar,” Alice said flatly. “I'm not getting anywhere near that bed again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed and sat up. “You act like that was my first time having sex in this bed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sex is one thing. Whatever I walked in on is another.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's not my fault you can't get a proper fucking, Alice,” Rio said flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're lucky I didn't aim for your head, asshole,” Alice groaned, slamming the door behind her before Rio could flip her off.
    </p>
    <p>
     She groaned when she heard Jen cackle from the living room, and grabbed one of the boxes from where it had landed, quickly unwrapping the packaging. There wasn't a sender name anywhere in the box, but the note attached to it spoke for itself.
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      A gift for your little choir girl.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio prayed that Jen and Alice couldn't hear her pathetic mewl.
    </p>
    <p>
     Inside the box was a climbing log for Victoria's enclosure. Extremely high-quality by the looks and feel of it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
     She smiled as she walked toward the enclosure and opened the lid, placing the log in a corner. Victoria immediately scuttled over and climbed onto it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed her phone from the nightstand and crouched down to take a photo of Victoria enjoying her gift. She tilted her head when she saw her own reflection in the glass. Rio imagined that Agatha would surely appreciate some softcore porn more than she'd appreciate a photo of her spider, so she might as well use her reflection to her advantage.
    </p>
    <p>
     She licked her lips and padded to her door and locked it. Yesterday had been embarrassing enough. She gently picked Victoria up and turned her back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry, Vicky,” she muttered as she took off her shirt. “It's for scientific purposes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed her chair from her desk and dragged it toward the enclosure before sitting down and crossing her legs. She moved a hand dangerously close to the waistband of her panties and adjusted the angle perfectly before snapping a photo.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip as she pressed send.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
     <em>
      Victoria says thanks.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned back to the second box as she waited for Agatha to reply. The note under the wrapping said,
     <em>
      A gift for my girl
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     Her breath hitched when she opened the box. Inside were two sparkling handcuffs. One dark green, the other dark purple. She whimpered and slammed the box shut before shoving it under her bed. Partly because if either Alice or Jen found it they'd never stop teasing her about it, partly because she had a feeling she'd come untouched just from thinking about Agatha using them on her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She jumped when a loud knock sounded at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, breakfast!” Jen called from outside her door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned. “Just a second!”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled her shirt back on and unlocked the door. Jen was still standing there and leaned against the door frame.
    </p>
    <p>
     She squinted. “Why did you lock your door?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because,” Rio said flatly, pushing past her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen snorted behind her. “Did you know that Alice called me begging me to bribe a doctor to remove her eyes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “JEN, NOT FUNNY!” Alice called out from the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “Jesus, big deal. I had Agatha over and forgot to lock my door. Not my fault she doesn't know how to knock.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice kicked her heel as Rio walked past her to grab a bowl of cereal from the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And it's not my fault that you don't know how to lock your door!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was actually a very nice roommate yesterday, because she wanted to fuck me in the hallway and I was very respectful of your rules and didn't let her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She chuckled under her breath when Alice made a gagging sound and carried her bowl of cereal to the dining table. Alice and Jen sat across from her, their gazes sweeping over her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice gasped. “Jesus, what the hell? What the fuck did she do to you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She fucked me, Alice. You should try and have someone do that to you sometime.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen cackled, and Alice threw a used napkin at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen gasped even louder when she saw the marks on Rio's wrists. “Since when are you into BDSM?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn't know you guys were interested in what kinks I have.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We are,” Jen said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, we are not! Keep them to yourself, pornstar.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Will you stop calling me that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, you did sound like one,” Jen mumbled. Alice punched her lightly on the shoulder and they both burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned and buried her face in her hands. “God, how old are you two? You're acting like two teenagers who just learned what sex is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They perked up when Rio's phone buzzed from where it lay face down on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      09:02am
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Congratulations, you've just earned yourself a good reason for me to put those cuffs to good use later.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio choked on her cereal, and Alice made a move for her phone. Rio took it back before she could see anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That was totally a text from Agatha,” Alice pointed out with a chuckle. “What did she give you, by the way?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How do you know the gifts were from her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I didn't
     <em>
      actually
     </em>
     know, but I just got you to confirm it,” she said smugly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio flipped Jen off when she cackled from across the table.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Speaking of Agatha…” Jen said, propping her chin on her hand. “How is your totally casual fuck buddies situationship with a married woman going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hesitated. She took a few spoonfuls of her cereal and swallowed hard. “About that…”
    </p>
    <p>
     She hesitated again. Alice and Jen were insufferable, but they were still her best friends, and they had always told each other everything. It didn't feel right to hide this from them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think I'm in love with her. Like, really,
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     in love with her.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen and Alice exchanged a glance before turning back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, Rio.”

     Rio never told her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not when they ditched hotels completely, always staying at Rio's apartment instead, not when she gave Agatha keys to her apartment, not when Agatha began staying the night so often that Rio feared it'd be only a matter of time until Ralph found out, and not when Agatha got into the habit of going through Rio's sketchbook while Rio slept next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was hard not to keep falling even harder for Agatha Harkness when Rio began waking up to some of her sketches scattered around the floor and praise written in Agatha's lipstick on the mirror when she had to leave before Rio woke up. She eventually stopped wiping them and started using the bathroom mirror to get ready instead. If this continued, though, she'd soon need a second mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was scratching Rio's scalp with one hand and flipping through her sketchbook with the other. Rio was half asleep, resting her head on Agatha's shoulder, with one arm draped over her chest.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You've been working a lot,” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grunted. “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled and kissed the top of her head. “Your sketchbook. You're filling this one up really fast.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She poked Rio's side. “Hey.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grunted again and buried herself further into Agatha's shoulder. “No. Stop it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She poked her again. “Rio, darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whined.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just want to ask you something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned and swatted at her hand. “You just fucked the absolute living shit out of me. Can you let me sleep?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Have you ever considered doing costume designs for movies?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her eyes just enough to blink at her. “What? No. I'm a stylist, not a designer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what are these?” Agatha asked, tilting the sketchbook toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sketches. That I do for fun. Can you stop talking now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and got out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Noooo,” she whined, trying to reach for Agatha. “It's cold. You're warm. Don't leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignored her protests and opened her wardrobe. She took some of Rio's pieces out and spread them across the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And what are these?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Pieces. That I do for fun.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, these are better than some of the ones I've seen by world class designers. You're insanely talented.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ugh. I don't care about those. I care about sleeping and about you sleeping next to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “And I care about you knowing how talented you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled over on her back and groaned. “I don't even know why you're asking me all this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put the pieces back in the wardrobe before she got back in bed and straddled Rio's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was planning on keeping it a surprise for longer, but since you're going to be this stubborn…”
    </p>
    <p>
     She trailed a few wet kisses up Rio's neck, and she sighed contentedly before sliding her hands up Agatha's sides.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm going to be in a new project soon. I asked around and they still need some people on the costume design team. You'd still have to do the interview, of course, but there's no fucking way they wouldn't hire you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Think about it. Just us in a hotel room for months, going to sleep together, waking up together…” she purred, nuzzling into Rio's neck. “Me fucking the stress out of you before and after work…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her and pouted. “You're so—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Obsessed with you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was going to say unfair, but that also works.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Maybe,” Agatha purred, brushing her lips against Rio's. “But is that a yes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you really think I would say no to having you all to myself whenever I want for months?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and rolled her hips slightly. “Mm, no.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned down and kissed Rio roughly, and Rio dug her nails into her sides when Agatha began to roll her hips a little harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is this what you want?” Agatha asked, nipping at Rio's jaw. “Me waking you up like this every day?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, yes,” Rio breathed. She gasped into Agatha's mouth when her rhythm became a little more erratic.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good to know,” she purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed Rio one last time and rolled off of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, what the fuck?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I thought you said you were tired.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That was before you started humping my legs.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled and kissed along Rio's jaw before pulling her into her arms. “Sleep, future superstar.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grumbled under her breath before sinking into Agatha's touch.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A week later, Rio was being led into Lilia Calderu's office in a huge building in central New York. Agatha had kept the name of the director a secret until the last minute, and Rio almost passed out when she finally revealed it. Lilia was one of her favorite directors of all time, and back when she was still considering going into designing full time before settling for styling, Rio's biggest dream was to one day be part of her team of costume designers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had arranged for her to get some photos taken wearing her own pieces, despite her multiple protests about not being a model, which Agatha didn't care about, because according to her, Rio was still the hottest woman she had ever seen. They turned out better than she had expected, and she was now carrying a huge folder filled with the photos, as well as multiple of her sketchbooks and some of her pieces on garment bags.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her legs trembled slightly as she walked into the room. Lilia looked up from her laptop and smiled as Rio sat down across from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio Vidal,” Lilia said, holding out her hand. “It's very nice to finally meet you. Agatha spoke very highly of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course she had. Rio shook her hand and hoped that she wouldn't notice how her fingers were trembling slightly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me more about yourself,” she said, already flipping through Rio's sketchbook. “Your resume says you've been styling for a while. What made you want to go back to designing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cleared her throat. “I never stopped designing, actually. It just became a side thing. Fashion school made me love styling just as much,” she said. “And, to be honest, I had to go with what paid the bills better.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia nodded. “I see.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But Agatha has always known about my sketches, and she's always told me that she thinks I have the talent for it, so—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     have the talent.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's stomach did a little flip. “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha mentioned she took you to get some photos done. Can I see them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and pushed the thick folder across the table. “The ones that I brought for you to see are marked with an X.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia flipped through the folder. “How did you choose which pieces you were going to bring?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She chose them based on what Agatha liked the most, but she wasn't going to say that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “They're my favorites and the ones I spent the most time on,” she said instead. “So I think they're ones that best reflect the type of effort I'd put on the pieces I'd design for a movie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia smiled and nodded. “Good answer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She finished flipping through the folder in silence before motioning for Rio to hand her the garment bags. She inspected each piece thoroughly, her smile never fading.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I have to say, you have a rare talent.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt like she was going to pass out. Before she could answer, Lilia cleared her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know, it's not exactly a secret that Agatha has had many stylists throughout her career. But I've known her for a few years, and she's never spoken this highly about any of them. You're different.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. She tried not to think about how Wanda Maximoff had warned her about not thinking that she was different all those months ago, but if Lilia Calderu was telling her that she was different, who was she to argue? She briefly wondered if Lilia knew about Agatha's habits.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to come up with a proper answer, but all that she could manage was a small nod.
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia smiled again. “It's a good thing that I trust her intuition.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled faintly and nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Filming begins in two months, but you'd start working in location next month already. I suppose Agatha has told you we'll be filming in Greece. Are you okay with that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She hadn't, but whatever. Rio briefly wondered if Agatha would be down to have some sex on the beach before replying, “Yes, absolutely.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia smiled and shook her hand. “Very well, then. Welcome to the team, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     If there was any competition for best head, Agatha had just earned herself what would've been a multiple championship winning one.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you so much. It will truly be an honor to work with your team. I promise I won't disappoint you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know you won't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed her phone as soon as Lilia's assistant saw her out of the building.

    </p>
    <p>
     A few hours later, she was getting ready to go see Agatha. Her head was still aching a little from the amount of screeching she had to endure from Alice and Jen when she told them the news. It had somehow been worse than when she had gotten hired by Agatha, though she suspected they were mostly celebrating the fact they wouldn't have to hear her and Agatha for a few months, and not the fact she had gotten a job with Lilia Calderu. They weren't the smartest people when it came to cinema, anyways.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha never needed an excuse to have mind-blowing sex, but experience had shown Rio that it was somehow even better when she wore one of her own designs, so that was what she'd be doing tonight. Per Agatha's request, she picked the shortest dress she had.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was already at the bar when Rio arrived. Rio thought that she deserved a prize for somehow being able to hold back a moan at the sight. Agatha was wearing a short dress Rio had selected for her a few weeks ago and that she was still to see her wearing. There was nothing in the world that she wanted more than to sit on Agatha's lap right then and there. Maybe she wanted to fuck Agatha right then and there a little more than just to sit on her lap, but getting arrested for public indencency wasn't on her list of goals for the year.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What's up, superstar?” Agatha said as Rio took a seat next to her. “How does it feel to be the newest member of the costume design team for Lilia Calderu's newest movie?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Insane.” She paused and smirked. “But that's not what I'm most excited about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled and took a sip of her drink. “What is it that you're more excited about, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know the answer to that,” Rio replied, motioning to the bartender to order herself a drink.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course I do. But I want to hear you say it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio leaned closer and whispered, “What I'm really looking forward to is having you in a hotel bed every morning and every night for months.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pressed a quick kiss to Agatha's jaw before sitting up straight again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was the one who leaned closer this time. “Just the bed?” she purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled and took a long sip of her drink. Not choking on it was quite an achievement. “Or wherever you want me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slid a hand under the table and squeezed Rio's thigh. She kept her hand there afterwards, which Rio wasn't going to complain about.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were both a few drinks in when Rio asked, “What did you tell Ralph this time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That I had dinner with a director and breakfast with another, both on the other side of town, too late and too early to justify coming home,” Agatha said, swirling her glass.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, that's hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Does me lying to my husband turn you on?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a sip of her drink. “Mostly because you lied to him so you can spend the night fucking me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She smirked. “I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say that again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and whispered, “I lied to my husband so I could spend the night fucking my insanely hot stylist.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stole a quick kiss and downed the rest of her drink. Agatha smirked and took a slow sip of hers, so Rio grabbed it and finished it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Someone's in a hurry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed Agatha's wrist under the table and guided her hand between her legs. Agatha's breath audibly hitched when she pressed down on Rio's soaked underwear. Unsurprisingly, that made her immediately ask for the check. As per usual, she paid without looking at the numbers and dragged Rio out of the bar and toward the parking lot, where her driver was already waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had her pressed against the door the second they got to Rio's apartment, and she fumbled blindly with the lock behind her, cursing against Agatha's lips when she failed to get it open for the fifth time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Poor baby,” Agatha cooed, trailing wet, open-mouthed kisses all over Rio's jaw. “Are you so turned on you can't unlock a door?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes,” Rio breathed. “Fuck. Just give me some space for a second—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't mean that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She really didn't. Agatha kissed right below her ear, making her gasp softly. Agatha slid her hands around her waist, and she finally managed to get the door open. They stumbled inside as Agatha's lips returned to hers, kissing her roughly and kicking the door shut behind them. Agatha spun them around and pressed Rio against the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me have you right here,” Agatha purred, trailing a hand up her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio vaguely remembered a rule against this kind of thing. Might've been a fever dream though, so whatever. She hooked a leg around Agatha's waist and moaned into her mouth when Agatha's fingers slipped past the waistband of her panties.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two coughs sounded from across the living room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus Christ, you two are animals,” Jen groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice scowled and pointed at the board on the wall before tapping her fingers against the first rule. Not a fever dream, then.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio slipped from between Agatha and the door with a growl and grabbed her wrist, dragging her down the hallway. “We'll be in my room.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pushed Agatha against the door as soon as she locked it and kissed her roughly as she blindly reached for the waistband of Agatha's panties to pull it down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Eager, eager, eager,” Agatha tsked, but she helped Rio pull it down anyway, kicking it to the corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have no idea,” Rio breathed against her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took Agatha's bottom lip between her teeth and soothed the bite with her tongue before kicking off her heels and getting on her knees. She didn't bother removing Agatha's dress, choosing to just bunch it up around her waist instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned softly at the sight of Agatha's dripping folds before diving in eagerly, latching onto her clit and flicking it mercilessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's head hit the door behind her with a dull thud. She grabbed Rio's hair and yanked at it before pushing her head deeper into her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, Rio,” she gasped. “God, your tongue is so fucking warm. Feels so fucking good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned at the praise and moved her tongue lower, pressing into Agatha's entrance and immediately feeling her clench hard around her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's grip on her hair tightened, making Rio whine into her. “You're going to make me come so fast—so fucking fast,” she panted, her heels slipping on the hardwood floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moved a hand up to her thigh to keep her in place. She moaned at the feeling of Agatha pulsing around her tongue, and the vibration only made her clench harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you dare stop,” she growled. “Fuck, your tongue is so deep, I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio curled her tongue and Agatha came hard, her orgasm flooding Rio's mouth and dripping down her chin. She kept Rio's head still as she ground down against her tongue, riding it out until her whole body began to jolt from the lightest touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha yanked Rio's head back by the hair hard enough to make her gasp. She was panting heavily, her chin and lips dripping with Agatha's release.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take your clothes off and get on the bed,” Agatha ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. She was still trying to catch her breath when she replied, “Yes, ma'am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both quickly peeled off their dresses, and Rio tossed her panties somewhere in the room before climbing onto the bed. Agatha pushed her down onto the mattress and kissed her roughly before suddenly climbing off of her to settle against the headboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't have to be told what to do. She crawled over to her and straddled her lap, keeping her hips raised slightly to allow Agatha to push her fingers into her, which she did without warning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned loudly as she immediately began to grind down onto Agatha's fingers, already clenching hard around them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love how you squeeze me when I fuck you like this,” she whispered, crooking her fingers slightly to thrust hard into Rio's favorite spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't stop,” Rio gasped. “God, I love how you fuck me, how deep you get—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pressed her thumb against Rio's clit and started to fuck her faster and rougher. “You're all mine, you hear me? No one else gets to have you like this. You're mine, Rio. Mine to fuck, mine to ruin. All mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded frantically. “All yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With a few targeted thrusts at her G-spot, Rio came hard, shaking above Agatha and gasping into the crook of her neck. Agatha kept her fingers buried deep inside her, groaning when Rio began to roll her hips into them again. Agatha responded by fucking into her again and using her free hand to pull Rio into a rough kiss, letting her moan and gasp into her mouth as she came again.
    </p>
    <p>
     It'd be a few hours until they tapped out. Rio had an arm draped over Agatha's stomach and was trailing lazy kisses over her shoulder when Agatha said, “I need to take a shower before bed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, you don't. You smell like me. It's hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I smell like sex. I'm not going to sleep covered in sweat and cum.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think that's even hotter.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled and kissed her softly before getting up and throwing on one of Rio's oversized shirts, ignoring her whines and grumbles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was already sleeping when she came back a few minutes later. She got into bed quietly and pulled Rio closer as gently as possible to avoid waking her up. Half-asleep, Rio nuzzled closer and sighed contentedly when she felt Agatha's fingers gently thread into her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     She downloaded a day counter app the following morning so she could keep track of how long it'd be until they were sharing a hotel room. She was so madly and stupidly in love with Agatha Harkness that it was almost embarassing.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      . . .
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's “last” day at work as Agatha's stylist came too fast. She was now sitting in Agatha's living room, nursing a cup of coffee. She'd need the energy to pack her bags later.
    </p>
    <p>
     Unfortunately, Ralph was sitting across from her. He had been making small talk for a while, and Rio was mostly responding with polite nods. He smiled when Agatha suddenly walked into the room, and Rio hoped that he hadn't noticed how she had smiled at the sight of his wife too.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha must have a lot of faith in your designs, Rio. Sacrificing having a stylist around all the time to let you do costume designs for a movie is a big deal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I might have to call her every now and then to show her what I'm wearing,” Agatha said with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip to stifle a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     She finished her coffee and was about to get up and leave when Nicky padded into the living room, holding Señor Scratchy tightly under his armpit. She had grown quite close to Nicky over the last few months, and having to leave him was stinging more than she'd like to admit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Miss Rio!” he said, running up to her and climbing up onto the couch next to her. “Mommy told me you're leaving.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just for a little while, buddy. I'll be back before you know it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked up at her, unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll even try to find you some bunny plushies. What do you think of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He seemed to consider her offer for a while before saying, quite bluntly, “Okay. You can leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled and ruffled his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked up at her again. “Are you going to take care of mommy when she leaves too?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a quick glance at Agatha, who gave her a knowing smirk. Asshole.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't worry, baby,” Agatha said softly. “Rio always takes really good care of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could swear Ralph tilted his head a little at that, but naybe she was imagining things. She cleared her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Give me a hug, buddy,” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nicky didn't hesitate before he wrapped her arms tightly around her. He nuzzled into her when she hugged him back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll miss you,” he said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll miss you too. But I promise I'll be back soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded before letting go of her. He got down from the couch and said, “Don't forget about my plushie.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He didn't wait for a reply before he bolted off the room. That was one of his habits, Rio had come to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
     A tiny part of her brain kept screaming about how badly she wanted to be his other mother so that she could bring him plushies all the time and surprise him with a giant bunny plushie for every Christmas until he grew out of his bunny phase. Maybe one day.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I should get going,” she said as she got up. “I still need to pack my bags.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph made a joke about that, though she didn't really pay attention as she was too busy trying not to roll her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Safe travels,” he said as she walked past him. “I'll see you when you get back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She hoped that he would no longer be living here by the time she came back, but whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll see you out,” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha put a hand on Rio's lower back as soon as they were out of Ralph's sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll see you in a month, darling,” Agatha said as they walked out of her house. “I'll miss you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pouted. “I'll miss you too. Terribly. I wish you could come with me already.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her into a hug and Rio hummed into the crook of her neck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I better not find out you've been dragging some random woman to your bed while I'm not there,” Agatha whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Possessiveness looks good on you, but I still haven't fucked anyone since the day I met you and it's going to stay that way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Good answer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She let Rio go and she left before her brain could convince her to turn around and make her fuck Agatha in a bush.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     The following morning, Rio's bed was a mess of suitcases and discarded clothing that she decided against taking at the last minute. And she was a mess herself. As much as she was looking forward to being with Agatha for these three months, leaving her best friends and Victoria behind for the first time ever was harder than she thought it would be.
    </p>
    <p>
     She held out the book that she had gotten printed out. The cover was a glittery pink with “Vicky's care guide” in a cursive, twirly font in the middle, along with a photo collage of Victoria.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright, what are your tasks?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen exchanged a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Feed the demon. Mist the demon's lair. Don't piss off the demon,” Jen said, rolling her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shot her a glare. “And for the love of God, do not let her die. I will know if you replace her with another tarantula.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened the enclosure, now filled with decorations Agatha had bought over the last few months, and reached for Victoria, who stayed perfectly on top of her favorite rock.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm so sorry, bebé,” she cooed. “I know you don't like it when I wake you up this early.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Victoria tapped her legs angrily against the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't be like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's so fucking weird,” Alice whispered. Jen chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're not helping,” Rio snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice shrugged.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wiggled her fingers slightly and Victoria finally scuttled up into her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “See? There you go. I'm going to miss you so much, but Alice and Jen will take good care of you.” She snapped her head toward them. “Right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     They both rolled their eyes before nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Be a good girl for them, okay?” She kissed the air above Victoria's head and carefully placed her back into her enclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
     Victoria immediately climbed onto the glass and tapped her legs against it. Rio was seriously about to cry, but her phone buzzed and snapped her out of it.

    <p>
     “Are you two seriously sexting right now?” Jen asked, standing behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio quickly locked her phone and stuffed it in her back pocket. “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice gagged. “I feel horrible for the cleaning crew at the hotel.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio rolled her eyes. “And I feel horrible for you who hasn't gotten laid in the past year.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen cackled, which earned her a hard kick to the heel.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Must I remind you that the fate of your spider will be in my hands?” Alice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't bring her into this! She's an innocent child, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice snorted. “Yeah, an innocent child who has had to watch her owner get railed by a woman twice her age every other night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We cover the enclosure.” She paused. “Most times.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't mean to ruin the mood,” Jen cut in, “but you'll miss your flight if we don't leave soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pouted as she turned back to face Victoria's enclosure. She ran her fingers through the glass where Victoria's legs sat and kissed it. She rolled her eyes when both Alice and Jen gagged behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll see you soon, Vicky. I promise. Behave.”

     She grabbed a suitcase and her handbag and left the room before she could start crying. Alice and Jen each grabbed a suitcase as well before following her out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cursed under her breath when the elevator almost closed on her foot as they struggled to fit everything in the tiny space.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you really need all of these things?” Jen asked as they made their way down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course I do. You never know when there's going to be an emergency and I want to be prepared.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice rolled her eyes. “You can just say that you want to look pretty for your girlfriend. No harm done.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's not my girlfriend,” Rio groaned as they got out of their building.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You wish she was, though,” Jen pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I don't!”
    </p>
    <p>
     That was just because she wished Agatha was her wife instead, but she was never going to tell Alice and Jen that. They probably knew, though.
    </p>
    <p>
     Fitting all of her luggage into the trunk of the Uber was one of the hardest things Rio had ever done. She was slightly breathless when she slid into the backseat next to Alice and Jen.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip as the Uber drove off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you okay?” Jen asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Yeah. It just feels weird. I have never been away from you guys for this long.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice rested her head on Rio's shoulder. “You'll survive. You got your scary rich girlfriend to take care of you while you do your fancy Hollywood job.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's. Not. My. Girlfriend,” Rio snapped. “She's just—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Insanely hot. And extremely good in bed, from what we hear,” Jen added with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Uber driver coughed, and Rio shot her a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was a pretty short drive to the airport, so they were there before they could say anything else. The driver helped them unpack and pile Rio's suitcases onto a cart before leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed as they approached the boarding area. She turned back around to face Alice and Jen, and immediately felt tears drip down her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Jen soothed, though she too was getting teary eyed. “Don't cry. You're going to kill it, Rio. This will be insanely good for your career, and we're so happy for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice nodded and pulled Rio into a tight hug. Jen immediately joined.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll miss you guys. So much.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We'll miss you more,” Alice said, her voice a little hoarse already. “Whore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kicked her heel playfully. “I mean it. You guys annoy the shit out of me most of the time, but you're my sisters.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen sniffled. “You're our girl. Always.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio Vidal, all grown up,” Alice added, wiping Rio's tears with her thumb. “Going to her grown woman job and to get fucked by an older woman at a five-star hotel in Greece. I'm so proud.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Yeah. Rio didn't know why she was going to miss them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The last call for boarding for Rio's flight snapped them out of it. Rio began crying a little harder as they all let go.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you. So much. Both of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice ruffled her hair a little.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We love you so much too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They shared one last quick hug before Rio turned toward the departure gate and began to walk off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go get them, pornstar!” Alice called out from behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio growled and flipped her off.
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed her phone as she settled onto her first class seat. Because of course Agatha had made sure she'd fly first class.

    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to scream, giggle and kick up her feet. But considering that would probably land her in a mental institution instead of on a plane, she settled for very quietly screaming into her palms.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the fact she was flying first class for the first time in her life, the flight was absolute hell. She had to sit extremely close to a mother with a screaming kid, and said mother wouldn't do anything about it because she was too busy snoring.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time she arrived at the hotel, she was so exhausted she could barely walk. She had to hold back a gasp as she walked into the lobby. Never in a million years she thought she'd be living in a place like that for a few months.
    </p>
    <p>
     She almost dropped her handbag when she opened the door to her room. It was absolutely massive. Way fancier than the rooms Agatha would book when they first started seeing each other, and those were already unreal.
    </p>
    <p>
     A bellboy helped with taking all of her suitcases to the corner of the room before nodding and leaving her by herself. She took off her jacket and draped it over one of them before heading into the bathroom. Unsurprisingly, it was also insane, complete with a huge bathtub. Rio bit her lip to stifle the moan that came out from the thought of riding Agatha's fingers in it. Agatha wasn't there yet, of course, so she'd have to use the bathtub the way it's meant to be used.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed a change of clothes from her suitcase and headed back to the bathroom. She filled the bathtub with warm water and some bath bombs that she found in one of the drawers and sighed as she sank into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat there for a while before grabbing her phone.

    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked when a FaceTime request immediately popped up. She bit her lip as she took the call, sitting up a little straighter to give Agatha a better view of her breasts.
    </p>
    <p>
     She recognized the shirt Agatha was wearing as one of her own.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, pretty girl,” Agatha purred. “God, you look good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just good?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “You're absolutely gorgeous. You know that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm. But I like it when you remind me.” She sighed. “I miss you already.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I miss you too, cariño. I'll be there soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A month isn't soon,” Rio argued. “I don't know why you can't just come early.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know I want to,” Agatha said softly. “But I still have obligations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pouted. “I hate your obligations.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Trust me, I hate them too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you have any idea how hard it is to be sitting in this giant bathtub all by myself?” She sighed dramatically. “My first thought when I saw it was how good you'd feel inside me, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     She trailed off when she saw one of Agatha's hands drift lower. “What are you doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “What do you think I'm doing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whined. “God, I want you so fucking bad,” she groaned. “I swear, the second you walk through this door, I'm not letting you leave the bed for a whole day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm, you do look like you need a good fucking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Desperately,” Rio breathed, her own hand starting to drift lower.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha went off screen for a second and cursed under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph just got home. I have to go, but I'll call you tomorrow, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wondered if she'd be the most obvious suspect if Ralph and a toaster somehow ended up in the same bathtub. Hypothetically, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pouted. “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kissed the tip of her fingers and pressed them to the screen. Agatha chuckled before doing the same and hanging up.
    </p>
    <p>
     She stayed there for a while longer before getting out and lazily drying herself and throwing on the shirt and panties she had picked. She headed straight to bed after that, and was asleep before she could even register herself closing her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     The following morning, she was awoken by a knock at the door. She got up and opened it with a sleepy groan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Delivery for Rio Vidal,” said the guy waiting outside. He was holding a small package.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyebrows furrowed. She hadn't ordered anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you,” she said, taking the package anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shook it lightly before setting it down on the bed, staring at it suspiciously. She asked herself if there was any real possibility of Ralph having sent her a bomb or if she was being too paranoid.
    </p>
    <p>
     Still, she tore open the wrapping paper around it. Her breath hitched, because she was now staring at the package of an expensive looking dark purple rabbit vibrator.
    </p>
    <p>
     The note attached to the box said,
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Sorry I can't be there to take care of you.
     </em>
     <em>
      I hope you'll make good use of this. Loudly, preferably. And while thinking about me.
     </em>
     <em>
      Enjoy, darling.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She immediately grabbed her phone. There was a high possibility she was going to be the first person in the world to die from Agatha Harkness-itis.

    </p>
    <p>
     Rio considered breaking a bone to get medically excused from work.
    </p>
    <p>
     That being said, her first day at work was a nightmare. There was so much to do, so many meetings to attend, and all she could think about was Agatha. She was so wet she feared it'd seep through her jeans. There were many times she seriously considered locking herself in the bathroom to get herself off. It got worse when Agatha started trying to initiate sexting. Rio turned her phone off after the seventh attempt.
    </p>
    <p>
     She wasn't allowed to say no to a costume design team dinner after work. This time, she considered faking food poisoning.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was late when she finally went back to her hotel room. She took a quick shower to clean up the embarrassing amount of slick between her legs and threw on a random shirt and panties before collapsing onto the bed and grabbing her phone.

    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's phone rang immediately after that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you alone?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Obviously.” A pause. “Are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm. Ralph went on a ridiculous camping trip with Jeff. Won't be back until tomorrow evening.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio prayed that he'd get eaten by a bear. Or by a wolf. Or by whatever extremely violent creature that might live in the woods.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You haven't answered my question. What are you wearing?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Another one of your shirts. Purple lace panties. Nothing else. You?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “A random shirt. The black panties that you love.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm. Do me a favor, darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard. ”Anything you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go get your new gift.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed the toy from the nightstand, her breath already wavering. She took the opportunity to yank her already ruined panties off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Put the phone on speaker,” Agatha commanded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did and placed it next to her. “Done.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good girl. Now touch yourself for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned low in her throat and flicked the toy on. She was just a few inches away from her throbbing center when Agatha interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah-ah,” she chided. “Use your fingers first.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whined, but obeyed. She whimpered the second her fingers touched her swollen clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, Agatha, I'm so fucking wet,” she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio heard the rustling of sheets and Agatha's breath hitching.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wish I was there to feel it,” Agatha breathed. “Fuck, Rio, I need to have my mouth on you. And my fingers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pushed two fingers deep inside of herself, moaning at how she pulsed around them. She pressed her thumb against her clit and rubbed it relentlessly in sync with her thrusts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, I can hear how wet you are,” Agatha moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio managed to hold back her gasps and moans long enough to be able to notice she could also hear obscene, wet sounds coming from Agatha's end.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, please—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasped sharply. “Fuck yourself with your new toy. Just the way you know I'd do it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio immediately reached for it and flicked it on before pressing it inside of herself and against her throbbing clit. She let out a moan so loud that Agatha probably would've been able to hear her even if her phone was across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How does it feel?” Agatha asked between pants, her fingers working faster into herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's voice wavered when she gasped out, “So fucking good. Fuck, Agatha, I'm so close—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned low in her throat. “Me too,” she managed. “Come with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With one last perfect press of the toy, Rio came hard, clenching around it and dripping down onto the sheets beneath her. She could hear Agatha's own orgasm following shortly after.
    </p>
    <p>
     For a while, they both stayed silent save for their heavy breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually, Agatha chuckled out a, “Fuck. You have no idea how hard you just made me come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Still catching her breath, she looked down at the sheets. Room cleaning service tomorrow would probably be a bit embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think I have a pretty good idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They were silent for a while longer.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Agatha eventually said. “Do you want to stay on the phone while we sleep?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Huh?” Rio asked, still a little dazed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I like listening to your breathing,” Agatha said. “Knowing you're there helps me sleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to cry. How could she not fall in love when Agatha talked to her like that?
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah,” she replied. “Of course. Your breathing helps me sleep too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good,” Agatha hummed, already half-asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good night, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sweet dreams, cariño.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glued her phone to her ear and fell asleep in a matter of seconds to the sound of Agatha's calm breathing.

    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had already hung up when Rio woke up. She checked her notifications to find two texts from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      06:45am
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Something came up. Won't be able to text much today.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Have a good day at work.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That was extremely weird and it made Rio just want to sleep all day and only wake up when Agatha was available again.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      07:00am
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      okay. hope everything's alright
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      💚
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Work without being able to talk to Agatha was almost unbearable. After texting Agatha a few times but getting no reply, she was starting to think that this was all a scheme to get rid of her. She missed the previous day's feeling of praying she wasn't seeping slickness through her pants. The day seemed to go by even slower than what it had then.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got into the bathtub as soon as she got back to the hotel. Agatha still hadn't replied. Hadn't even read her messages, last she checked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever had kept Agatha so busy that she couldn't reply to her all day probably had been exhausting. Rio figured that she deserved a little treat for it. Rio actually hoped that it'd make Agatha hop on a plane and come be with her a month in advance. Worst case scenario, it'd just end in phone sex again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sat up straighter so that her breasts were only barely covered by a few bubbles and angled her phone perfectly. She smirked as she took the photo and pressed send.
    </p>
    <p>

     <em>

    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     to reply to this, right? Rio had sent her an embarrassing amount of nudes over the last few months and they had never gone ignored. A few minutes later, Agatha still hadn't even read her texts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio spent a while longer soaking in the bathtub, checking her phone every few minutes to see if Agatha had replied. Nothing. She tried to stop thinking about it that much, because she was only a few thoughts away from grabbing her hair dryer and tossing it into the bathtub.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she got out, she quickly dried herself and put on just a pair of panties and a robe, which she tied loosely around her waist. She padded into her room and closed the blinds before taking her robe off and tossing it onto an armchair nearby.
    </p>
    <p>
     She selected a random movie Agatha was in and pressed play before grabbing the toy from the nightstand. If Agatha wasn't going to give her any actual attention today, she might as well try to solve her chronic horny-ness by herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     A knock sounded at the door just as she was about to pull her panties down. She groaned as she turned the TV off and tossed the toy back inside the drawer before she got up and grabbed her robe from the armchair, tying it tightly around her waist. Another knock sounded at the door, louder this time. Rio grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm coming, for fuck's sake—”
    </p>
    <p>
     With another groan, she yanked the door open.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her stomach did an Olympic level flip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Miss me?” Agatha purred, leaning against the doorframe.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio responded by yanking her into her room and locking the door behind them. She pressed Agatha against it and kissed her hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How?” she asked when they pulled apart for air.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and kissed her again, her fingers digging into Rio's hips. She kissed the tip of Rio's nose when they pulled apart again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Managed to reschedule all of my obligations. Said I had more important things to tend to out of the country,” she said smugly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And Ralph?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Told him something came up and I'd have to start filming earlier. Got Lilia to cover for me in case he decides to be nosy and ask.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait. Does Lilia know about—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She knows that I can't stand my husband,” Agatha said smugly. She walked further into the room and shrugged off her jacket, draping it over an armchair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned, already undoing the buttons on Agatha's blouse. “That's not the only reason why you're here, though, is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let her push the blouse off her shoulders. “Someone's eager.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Answer my question,” she said, moving to unclasp Agatha's bra.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “That and the fact I can't stand being that far away from you. Especially after last night.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You spent the whole day ignoring me,” Rio growled. “Could've at least sent me something to get off to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was on a plane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You say that like sending me a nude from the bathroom wouldn't be hot as fuck.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhaled shakily. “Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop complaining and fuck me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked. “Gladly.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed Agatha roughly as she backed her toward the bed until the back of her knees hit the mattress. Rio was quick to get on her knees and pull Agatha's pants down along with her panties, giggling when Agatha kicked them aside.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned and licked her lips at the sight of Agatha's glistening folds. She leaned in and inhaled softly before kissing the inside of her thigh and hummed against the warm skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't tease,” Agatha warned. She grabbed a fistful of Rio's hair and pushed her forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked against her and licked a slow, firm stripe through Agatha's slit, moaning at the taste and at how she pulsed under her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love how you taste,” she moaned between licks.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned loudly and dug her nails into Rio's scalp when she sucked Agatha's clit into her mouth, flicking it relentlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, just like that,” she groaned, pushing Rio further into her and grinding hard against her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her through her eyelashes as she licked a stripe down Agatha's slit and pressed her tongue inside, curling it against Agatha's favorite spot over and over until she felt her orgasm soak her tongue. She fucked her through it until Agatha tugged at her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, you're a literal goddess,” Agatha panted, her grip on Rio's hair finally loosening. “I love your mouth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hummed contentedly and ran her fingers through the slick on Agatha's thigh before taking them into her mouth and sucking them clean with a filthy moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked up at her and batted her eyelashes. “You made such a mess.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled breathlessly and ran her fingers through Rio's hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I could clean you up,” Rio mused, dragging her nails down Agatha's thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't wait for permission before she dove back in, her warm tongue flicking out to lap up the slick dripping from Agatha's inner thighs. Agatha let her have it for a few seconds before she tugged her back by the hair hard enough to make Rio gasp.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was about to beg in every language that she knew (which weren't many, admittedly) when Agatha tilted her chin up with two shaky fingers and breathed, “Keep your eyes on me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned at the command and leaned back in, looking at Agatha through her eyelashes as she lapped up the wetness from the crease of her other thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This is my favorite taste in the world,” Rio purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     She dragged her tongue back to Agatha’s folds and teased them with kitten licks. Agatha's grip on her hair tightened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled. “You're sensitive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't give Agatha time to respond before she pressed her tongue against her again, firmer this time, humming at the taste.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, you're going to make me come again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked against her skin and sucked her clit into her mouth, groaning when Agatha's nails dug into her scalp. She pushed two fingers down to the last knuckle and curled them against Agatha's favorite spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tugged on Rio's hair to remind her to keep her eyes on her, and Rio immediately looked back up as she kept sucking and fucking into her relentlessly until Agatha came again with a broken moan. She rode her through it until Agatha yanked her head back.
    </p>
    <p>
     She rested her forehead on Agatha's knee as she caught her breath, kissing it every now and then and sighing contentedly as Agatha ran her fingers through her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips with a hum as she looked back up at her. “Better?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get up here,” Agatha growled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't have to be told twice. She stood up on shaky legs and straddled Agatha's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why are you still dressed?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled. “That's on you for not ripping them off of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Strip for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her bottom lip. “Are you seriously not going to rip my—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I told you to strip, didn't I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She let out an exaggerated sigh and climbed off of her, rolling her eyes as she stood up. “Okay, okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's smirk widened as she scooted over to rest against the headboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio untied her robe slowly and let it hang loosely around her body before sliding it off her shoulders, revealing her bare chest as she put her hair up in a bun to give Agatha a clearer view.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pouted as she ran a hand over her soaked underwear. “Fuck, you should see how wet I am. I don't know why you won't rip them off of me already.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're going awfully slow for someone who's desperate to get fucked.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled and hooked her fingers under the waistband of her panties.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cocked her head. “Last chance. Are you sure—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Take them off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed dramatically again, but pushed them down. As she did, a thin line of slick connected the fabric to her soaked folds, snapping when they slid further down her legs. She looked up at Agatha and smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Cat got your tongue?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She picked her panties from the floor and dangled them from her fingers before climbing back onto bed and straddling Agatha's lap again. “Do you want them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snatched it from her hand and tossed it across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pouted. “That was very ungrateful of you. I made them all wet for you and you just discard them?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha lifted Rio's hips and thrust two fingers inside of her without warning, groaning when she was met with no resistance whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, I missed this,” Rio moaned, her lips brushing against Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Missed what, exactly?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked against her lips. “You. Your fingers. How good you fuck me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Was me making you come through the phone last night not enough?” Agatha asked, curling her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head. “Never is. And—” She cut herself off with a gasp when Agatha pressed her thumb against her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a deep breath before continuing, “And my fingers don't feel the same way yours do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted. “I bet you were so frustrated.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Fuck, I was. And then you left me all alone today—” She cut herself off with a shaky gasp. “I was about to fuck myself with the toy you gave me while watching one of your movies before, fuck—before you got here, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, I want to watch you do that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and buried her face on Agatha's shoulder when she began to fuck her faster. “Fuck, I'm so fucking close already.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tugged her back by the hair. “Look at me when you come.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She replaced her thumb with her palm and Rio came hard, dripping down Agatha's wrist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha let her roll her hips in small circles as she rode it out, sighing contentedly as she felt her pulse around her fingers, her free hand stroking Rio's back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is this what you were picturing when you told me I'd have to make up for lost time when I got here?” she asked, keeping her fingers buried inside of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned against her pulse point and kissed her jaw. “I don't know. Might have to go again to make sure.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha curled her fingers. “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm. Fuck. Could use your mouth too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and withdrew her fingers, making Rio whimper at the sudden loss, before flipping them over, pinning Rio under her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She pressed her slick fingers to Rio's lips. “Open.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obeyed immediately, taking her fingers into her mouth and sucking greedily, moaning at the taste of herself on them. She nipped at Agatha's jaw as soon as she pulled her fingers out of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Make me come again,” Rio whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Insatiable slut,” Agatha purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked. “All yours to fuck, though.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned and sucked a bruise onto one of her breasts. “God, I love when you say that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “All yours, all yours, all yours, all yours, all yours, all yours—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cut her off by sliding down her body and pressing a wet kiss to her clit before she flattened her tongue, humming at the wetness, the vibration making Rio shudder and buck her hips into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fucking—fuck, please, please, please—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her clit between her lips and rolled it with her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want your fingers too,” Rio whined. “Please?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled away just enough to click her tongue and purr, “Needy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She still obeyed, crooking her fingers as she pushed them back in. She took Rio's clit back into her mouth and she moaned so loud that they'd both be surprised if they didn't get a noise complaint in the next five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio almost wanted to tell her to slow down. She was going to come so fast it was embarrassing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't hold back on me,” Agatha purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sped up her thrusts until the bed was creaking slightly beneath them, her free hand moving to hold Rio in place when she thrashed wildly as she came. She kissed her trembling thighs a few times in between pants before she slid back up her body.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tapped her fingers against Rio's lips again. “Here. Open.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sucked on them greedily again, moaning obscenely at the taste of herself as she kept firm eye contact with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha finally pulled them free with a wet pop, Rio reached for her chin and ran her own fingers over the slick that was still there before taking them into her mouth, keeping eye contact with Agatha as she sucked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned low in her throat and tugged at Rio's wrist, making her take her fingers out of her mouth, before she leaned down and kissed her roughly. She slid her own hand back down between Rio's legs, smirking against her lips when Rio instinctively parted them, and brushed her fingers lightly against Rio's clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let out a choked sob and grabbed Agatha's wrist when she pushed them back inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Too much?” Agatha asked, pulling out a little.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip and nodded, tears pricking her eyes. “Feels so fucking good, though,” she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good answer,” Agatha purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed Rio roughly, swallowing the near scream she let out when Agatha twisted her wrist slightly and began to thrust relentlessly into her G-spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio instinctively clawed at her wrist. “Agatha, I can't—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can. You've got it, Rio. I know you do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha had made her come hard about a thousand times at this point, but this time felt different. It was all too much, too fast, leaving Rio gasping against Agatha's lips, her hand shaking around her wrist. Agatha must have felt it too, because she pressed her thumb to Rio's clit and rubbed it in firm circles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so close, Rio,” she coaxed. “Just let go for me. Let me have it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, her hips bucking against Agatha's hand despite the overstimulation that was making her entire body shudder, every trust making her jolt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, please, please, please—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha thrust her fingers into her one more time, and Rio came hard, her orgasm gushing out of her and soaking Agatha's hand and the sheets beneath them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, Rio, that's it,” Agatha groaned. “That's what I wanted to see.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kept moving her fingers slowly until Rio weakly pushed at her hand with a low whimper. She withdrew her fingers slowly and wiped them on the already ruined sheets before she gently pulled Rio into her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, okay, you're done. You're okay. I got you,” Agatha soothed, stroking Rio's hair. “You're safe. Just breathe for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio buried her face in Agatha's shoulder, panting. “Fuck, fuck, fuck, Agatha—that was—holy shit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her closer and kissed the top of her head. “I know, darling. I know. You did so fucking good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn't know I could do that,” she rasped, burying her face deeper, her thighs still twitching.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now you do,” Agatha whispered. She kissed the top of her head again. “You're a dream.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her close until her breathing evened out and her thighs stopped twitching.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Water?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded weakly, whimpering when Agatha easened her grip around her and set her back down onto the bed. She moved quickly and came back with a bottle of water she took from the minifridge.
    </p>
    <p>
     She helped Rio sit up and held the bottle to her lips, making sure she drank slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “How are you feeling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled breathlessly. “Better than ever. Just really, really tired.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed Rio's temple. “You were so fucking good for me. That was the hottest thing I've ever seen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm, I like being good for you,” Rio hummed, tilting her head up slightly so that Agatha could kiss her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me give you a bath,” Agatha said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She chuckled. “Just wait here, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pouted when Agatha got out of the bed, watching as she padded into the bathroom. It wasn't long until a faint scent of vanilla filled the air, and Agatha walked back into the bedroom shortly after that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on,” she said, helping Rio up. “Let me take care of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She walked Rio toward the bathroom and put her hands over her eyes when they neared the door, only taking them off when they reached the bathtub. It was overflowing with bubbles and surrounded by scented candles. Rio had no idea where those had come from.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was so in love with Agatha Harkness that it hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha helped her into the tub and slid in behind her. “Comfortable?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm.” She sunk further into Agatha's chest with a content sigh. “I love when you take care of me like this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I love taking care of you. You're something else, you know that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed the top of Rio's head and grabbed the bar of soap from the edge of the tub and slowly, gently, dragged it over Rio's body, massaging her with her free hand as she went. She smiled when Rio hummed contentedly and leaned into her touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm so proud of you,” Agatha said when she was done. “My superstar.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled and spun around to face her fully and kiss her lips softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Proud of you for getting this job,” Agatha continued. “Proud of you for what you just did in that bed. You're out of this world.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nuzzled into her neck. She never knew what to say when Agatha praised her like that. Agatha didn't mind.
    </p>
    <p>
     They stayed like that for a while. Eventually, when the water started getting cold, Agatha shifted a little and said, “Wait here. I'm going to change those sheets. I remember there being some spare ones the last time I stayed in this hotel.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nooo,” Rio whined, pouting. “Stay with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll be quick.” She kept kissing the tip of Rio's nose and caressing her cheeks with her thumbs until she stopped pouting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio still whined a little more when Agatha got out of the bathtub and wrapped herself in a towel. It felt like an eternity had passed when Agatha came back, though it hadn't been more than just a few minutes. Agatha was now wearing Rio's oversized Snoopy shirt and was holding the button-up blouse she had been wearing when she arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled softly at the sight of Agatha wearing her shirt. “That shirt brings back good memories.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does it now?” Agatha asked with a knowing smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She let Agatha help her out of the tub and wrap her in another towel. She reached down to dry herself, but Agatha tutted and did it herself, kissing the damp skin as she went. When she was done, she helped Rio onto her shirt, and Rio inhaled deeply, humming at how the scent of Agatha's perfume clung onto it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha walked her back into the bedroom and onto the freshly made bed. She gave her some more water before adjusting the blankets over her and kissing her cheek, making sure she was comfortable before slipping under the covers next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you work tomorrow?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, thank God.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled. “How about we sleep in and I take you for a walk around town when we wake up?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm, that's romantic,” Rio said, nuzzling into Agatha's chest. “Sounds nice.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled and pulled her even closer. She ran a hand soothingly over Rio's back until her breathing evened out.
    </p>
    <p>
     These months together would be a good warmup for when Agatha left Ralph for her and they moved in together, Rio thought. And then they'd live together forever and ever and ever and ever.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     As promised, they spent the following day walking around town. Agatha bought her dozens of things just because she judged Rio looked at them for a second too long, even though Rio would tell her over and over that she didn't have to spend money on her. Mostly because it was making her imagine Agatha buying her the best, most expensive custom made wedding ring that money could buy if Rio succeeded in making Agatha fall in love with her. Maybe one day, she mused.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio also took the opportunity to visit a toy store and buy Nicky the plushie that she had promised him. She managed to convince Agatha to let her pay for this one.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later that night, they were laying in bed together, a half-empty bottle of wine between them. An empty one sat on the floor. They had been there for a little over an hour, alternating between kissing and talking about the randomest of things.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were both a little past tipsy by now.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I never told you why I hate Evanora so much,” Agatha said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. Agatha would rarely bring up her mother, and when she did, it was to talk about how she wished she was burning in hell. Rio never pressed further.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a sip of her wine and exhaled sharply. “She used to say that I was born evil. That she knew from the second I was born that there was something wrong with me and that her biggest regret was not killing me right then and there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha…”
    </p>
    <p>
     “When I was sixteen, I fell in love with this girl. There had been others before her, but she was the first one I was serious with, if you can call exchanging stupid love letters and holding hands behind school serious. We thought we were being so careful. We never let anyone see us. I'd hide the letters under my mattress.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She exhaled shakily. Rio decided to just let her talk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “One day, I came home from school and she was sitting in the living room holding a piece of paper. I immediately knew what it was.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt sick. She set her glass aside.
    </p>
    <p>
     “She told me to sit down and she read the whole thing out loud. I remember she’d stop reading just to laugh at it every now and then.” She paused. “It was so stupid. Just filled with things like ‘
     <em>
      you're the best thing that ever happened to me
     </em>
     ’, ‘
     <em>
      you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen
     </em>
     ’ and plans to run away together.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Another pause, longer this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When she was done reading, she called me sick. Said I disgusted her and she didn't know why God chose to punish her by making me her daughter. And then she slapped my face so hard that I fell to the floor. And then she dragged me to my bedroom and locked me there without food or water for three days. I was only allowed out when the pastor came to pray for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “Three—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The pastor then told her that I was too evil for him to handle and recommended a camp. You know what kind. Said the people there would rip the evil off of me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio reached for her hand. Agatha let her take it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't remember much. Now I know it was a trauma response. I also know that some of the girls who were there with me never got out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How did
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     get out?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I acted the way they wanted me to act. Didn't complain, didn't fight them. I thanked them for saving me. Made them think they had healed me.” She shrugged. “Not that there was anything to heal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She paused. “By the time I ‘graduated’ from their program, I had spent so much time pretending to be someone I wasn't that I started believing it too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't realize she was crying until Agatha reached over and wiped a few tears from her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It never made her a better mother, though. She'd still punish me whenever she thought she had to remind me how I should act.” She sighed. “I ran away the night I turned eighteen. I crushed sleeping pills into her glass of water and left. By the time she woke up, I had probably already crossed state borders.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She exhaled shakily and took a long sip of her wine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But she kept making my life a living hell for months. I don't know how she kept finding me. I used fake names, only took cash jobs, never stayed at the same address for long. But she'd always be there. Waiting outside of my apartment. Calling me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What did she even want from you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugged. “To keep terrorizing me, I suppose.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She sighed. “Until one day she stopped. I never saw or heard from her again. That was somehow worse, because I kept dreading the day she'd show up again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio squeezed her hand a little harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I eventually found out that she had died. Car crash coming home from church. Ironic, isn't it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to learn a resurrection spell and bring that woman back to life just to give her a more painful death.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I found out a year later. I just happened to run into one of our old neighbors. She asked if I'd at least come to the church event they were organizing for the first anniversary of her passing. She assumed that I knew she had died and had chosen not to go to her funeral because I was an ungrateful, terrible kid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “How did knowing that she had died make you feel?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Like I was free,” she said simply. “But at first I thought it was one of Evanora's schemes. I thought she had sent that woman there to see what I was doing with my life. I was so far away from my hometown that it just didn't make sense for her to be there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The answer seemed obvious, but Rio still asked, “Would you have gone to her funeral if you had known about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Surprisingly, Agatha nodded. “To spit on her casket, yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She sighed. “After that, I managed to settle down. Got into acting. It turned out that the years of pretending to be someone I was not ended up paying off, because everyone would tell me that my talent was unmatched. It was easy for me to climb up the ranks.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She poured herself another glass. “I've never told anyone about this, you know. Other than my therapist a few years ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And Ralph.” It wasn't really a question. Rio thought that it was so obvious that Agatha didn't even have to mention it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head. “If I ever told him, he'd want to visit her grave to thank her for saving his wife.”
    </p>
    <p>
     So that's what Wanda meant when she warned her against wearing the bracelet around him.
    </p>
    <p>
     “When I met him, a small part of me still thought that I had to be fixed. By the time I realized that that was a lie, it was too late. We were married. Trying for a baby. Everything was so frustrating. That was when I started… you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and hesitated before asking, “Why don't you divorce him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because I can't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's not that simple with him. Especially if I did it to publicly be with another woman. He'd find a way to destroy me. I wouldn't be surprised if he dug up my childhood and used it to claim the trauma made me unfit to be a mother so that he could take Nicky away from me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted him to be eaten by wild dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And Nicky loves Ralph. I can't take that away from him. So I just stay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A pause. And before Rio could say anything, Agatha muttered, “He isn't Ralph's.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nicky.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's frown deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled lightly. “It's not what you think.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Another pause. Then, “Ralph is completely infertile.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted his useless balls to be ripped off by wild dogs. Slowly, preferably.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We used a sperm donor. Looked for someone who matched his appearance, because he thought it'd be embarrassing for him if the media found out about his infertility.” She paused and chuckled. “As if the media gives a shit about him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does Nicky know?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head. “Ralph is still his father anyways. He doesn't have to know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, and they were both silent for a while.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What was your mother like?” Agatha eventually asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. “My mother is alive.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “No. What was she like when you came out to her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing like yours,” Rio said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head. “It doesn't feel fair. After everything you've told me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scooted slightly and set her glass down onto the floor so that Rio could rest her head on her lap. “Come here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She ran her hands through Rio's hair as soon as Rio laid down. “I want you to tell me. It's not about being fair or not. You have happy memories with your mom and I want you to tell me about them. You don't have to keep anything for yourself just because you had them easier than I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She just didn't care. At all. I thought it'd be this big moment, and she just nodded. Later she told me it was because she had always known.” She chuckled. “Said she never believed that the ‘
     <em>
      friends
     </em>
     ’ I brought home were just my friends. But it didn't matter to her. She just wanted me to be safe and happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned down and kissed her forehead. “I'm really happy that that was how it went for you.” She paused. “And your mother sounds like the type of mom I try to be for Nicky.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smiled. “She'd love you, by the way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A beat. And then, Agatha asked, “When can I meet her?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. She couldn't tell if Agatha was being serious or not. And Agatha didn't elaborate further either. Maybe it was better that way.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's getting late,” she said instead. “We should go to sleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and sat up. She followed Agatha into the bathroom when she went there to brush her teeth and wrapped her arms around her waist and kissed her shoulder. She wanted to say something about Agatha's past. Try to comfort her. But it was also the type of thing that her words wouldn't be able to heal, and Agatha didn't seem to be expecting her to try to. She leaned into Rio's touch and ran a hand through her hair before turning around and kissing her softly. Agatha grabbed her hand and gently took her back to bed, and she kept Rio glued to her own body the whole night.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      . . .
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     The next two months flew by. Agatha's hotel room went mostly forgotten, only being used as a storage for her clothes and for when she had to call Ralph at night and couldn't risk him hearing or seeing Rio. And between stolen kisses in Agatha's trailer and the absolute insane sex they had day and night at Rio's hotel room, Rio was almost certain that Agatha would dump Ralph for her the second they were back home.
    </p>
    <p>
     It was now the last day of filming.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was shifting through a rack when an assistant walked into the room. She could never remember his name. Timmy? Tommy? Toby? Something like that, she was pretty sure.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Excuse me. Mrs. Harkness wants to see you in her trailer,” he said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. “Did she say what she wanted?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He shook his head. “Just said it was urgent.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Thank you,” she said, already moving past him.
    </p>
    <p>
     She arrived at Agatha's trailer in record time, and knocked once before entering.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is everything okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Lock the door,” Agatha ordered from where she sat at the edge of the couch, her legs spread just enough.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obeyed without question.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's our last day. I thought we could do something fun.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow and walked toward her. “Define fun.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you trust me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Without hesitation, Rio replied, “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and opened her hand to reveal a small wireless toy.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You want me to wear this?” she asked, already slightly breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's lips twitched as she unbuttoned her jeans.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Aren't you even going to question it?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.” She pulled her jeans down along with her panties. “Put it on for me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and kneeled in front of Rio. She made quick work of adjusting the toy, making sure it was exactly where she wanted it before tugging Rio's underwear and pants back up. She grabbed her phone and synced the app to the toy with a satisfied hum.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Still trust me?” she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Al—” She cut herself off with a sharp gasp when Agatha flicked the toy on, her knees buckling. “Oh, fuck.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Too much?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She let out a breathless laugh. “No. Perfect.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and pulled her into a rough kiss. She blindly thumbed at her phone and raised the intensity a bit just to feel Rio gasp into her mouth before turning it back down.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you going to be a good girl for me, Rio?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't sure. Maybe it'd be safer if she ripped out her vocal chords. Still, she nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Go on, then,” Agatha purred. “I'll see you on set.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She smacked Rio's ass when she turned to leave.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Behave, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio replied with a very unconvincing, “Yes, ma'am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The first stronger buzz hit her the second she stepped back inside the building. She cursed under her breath and bit her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
     The second one came when she was adjusting the hemline of a dress. She gasped audibly, her grip on the pin faltering.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is everything alright?” the actress asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded quickly. “Muscle cramps. You know how it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She finished her adjustments and glanced across the room to find Agatha smirking at her before looking down at her phone. Rio's phone buzzed a few seconds later.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      12:31pm
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Do you need to excuse yourself, pretty girl?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shot her a warning glare. Agatha responded by raising the intensity for a few seconds, and Rio had to brace herself against a nearby chair. She should've known it was going to go like this.
    </p>
    <p>
     By the time they were finally done taking the wrap-up photos hours later, Rio was pretty sure that this toy was ths modern equivalent of some medieval torture device. She had no idea how she managed to get through the day without moaning once.
    </p>
    <p>
     Her legs were trembling when the same assistant from before came up behind her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mrs. Harkness asked if you could go back to her trailer. Said she had some personal matters to discuss with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The only reason why Rio didn't sprint there was that she was afraid Agatha would suddenly raise the intensity and she'd fall flat on her face. She entered the trailer without knocking and locked the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha was laying on the couch and smirked when she walked in. “Come here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't hesitate. She fumbled with her jeans and panties, kicking them off on her way to Agatha. Her inner thighs were glistening when she straddled Agatha's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You did so good,” Agatha praised, running her hands up Rio's thighs. “God, watching you act like nothing was happening made me so wet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio threw her head back when Agatha upped the intensity again and began to guide her against her thigh.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You were driving me insane. Do you know how hard it was to not drag you into a bathroom to make you fuck me properly?” Rio groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm, maybe that's what I wanted you to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whined when she took a hand off of her hips to up the intensity again. She was so close, teetering on the edge, desperately gasping for air.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were interrupted by a knock at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha? Are you in there?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned, and Rio cursed under her breath and scrambled off of Agatha before she could do anything about it. She grabbed Agatha's phone and turned the toy off, whining at the loss.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I’ll be right there!” she called out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio quickly grabbed her clothes off the floor and scrambled to put them on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Relax,” Agatha whispered. “Just act normal.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard and nodded. She sat back down on the couch as Agatha went to unlock the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sorry,” Agatha said as Lilia walked into the trailer. “Didn't realize I had locked it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia's gaze flickered to Rio before she could respond to that. Her eyebrows furrowed. “Is everything okay here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her mouth to respond, but Agatha intervened quickly. “I called her here to help me adjust the dress I was planning on wearing for the wrap party.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded in agreement.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I see,” Lilia replied, though she didn't sound too convinced. “That's what I came here to talk about. We're leaving soon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cleared her throat. “Yeah, about that. We were talking and we decided we're not attending. You know, we still have to pack and we fly back tomorrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia frowned. “That was never a problem for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “People change, Lilia. I'm sorry, but we're not going.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A beat. Then, “Well, if you say so.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze flickered back to Rio. “And I wanted to congratulate you on your work. Truly fantastic, Rio. I'll want to meet with you in a few days to discuss working together again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “That—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She'd love that,” Agatha cut in. “Lilia, didn't you say you had to leave soon?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Lilia tilted her head. Somehow, she didn't argue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good job, the two of you,” she said simply, before opening the door and leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha burst out laughing. “If I had a nickel for every time we got interrupted while I had a vibrator in you…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled despite herself and tapped her lightly on the shoulder. “Grab your things. We're leaving.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Yes, ma'am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They went straight to Rio's room when they arrived at the hotel, their clothes already half-off before the door was locked behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The only downside was that they got zero hours of sleep the night prior to a long flight. Rio seriously wondered how she'd manage to go back to their normal routine of not having this much sex every single day. She'd maybe need some therapy.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      . . .
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     A few months had passed since the wrap, and Rio was back to her regular job as Agatha's stylist. But with awards season now in full swing, Agatha was constantly asking Rio to design dresses for her. Rio would make them as perfect as she possibly could, and all of them had earned extremely positive comments everywhere. It was no surprise when Agatha asked her to design her a dress for the Oscars.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had given Rio a lot of creative freedom with this one, which was how she ended up with a rough sketch of a sparkling purple dress that had a chain hanging down onto where Agatha's thigh would sit. At the tip of the chain, sat a golden “R” shaped charm.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave it some finishing touches before showing it to Agatha one night. She climbed onto bed next to her and tilted the sketchbook toward her so that she could get a good look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you think?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha immediately pointed at the chain. “This goes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What? Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She shot her a look. “You know why.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's just a letter.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's your initial.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's also Ralph's initial,” Rio argued. “No one's going to know. Just you and me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She set the sketchbook aside and straddled Agatha's lap, nuzzling into her neck. “Mm? Pretty please?”
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha didn't respond, she rolled her hips hard onto her. “Are you really going to say no to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed. “God, you make it really hard to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked and kissed her roughly before whispering, “Is that a yes?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha responded by flipping them over and sliding her hand under Rio's underwear.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     A few weeks later, it was Oscars night. Rio was adjusting the dress around Agatha's frame. It has turned out much better than she thought it would. She ran her fingers over the charm.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was about to say something when Ralph walked into the fitting room. Rio pulled her hand away quickly and stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That looks great, Rio,” he said, walking over to Agatha. “You look fabulous, love.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio fought the urge to roll her eyes. “Thank you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     His gaze dropped down to the charm. “Is that—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For you,” Rio said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bit back a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph smiled. “Oh, Rio. Thank you. It's so sweet that you included that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Of course. I'm just so fascinated about how much you guys love each other, so I felt like I had to include it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He took one last look at Agatha's dress before checking his watch. “I'll drop by Jeff's place for a bit. We have some things to discuss. I'll be back in a couple of hours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “We have to leave in three hours,” Agatha warned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I'll be back in two,” he said, already walking out of the room. “Good job again, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha burst out laughing the second he was gone. “I'm so fascinated about how much you guys love each other,” she echoed. “Seriously?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio began to laugh too. “Was I convincing enough?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “For an idiot like my husband, yes,” Agatha said, walking over and making her back up until she was crowded against the wall. “You haven't told me what you think of me in this dress.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked when Agatha brushed her lips against hers. “I think you look hot. Extremely hot. But you'd look even hotter without it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed her roughly, making Rio gasp into her mouth. She had never kissed her in her house before. Rio felt like her heart was about to explode like a piñata.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm, maybe later,” she purred against her lips. “I'll find a way to get away from him during the afterparty. Take you somewhere nice and quiet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know she was invited to an afterparty, but she wasn't about to argue. She moaned at the thought and kissed Agatha roughly again.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     So that's what they did. They had been at the afterparty for a while when Rio felt her phone buzz on her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      01:25am
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I'll go to the bathroom.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Give it a few minutes and meet me there.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at Agatha, who gave her a small, knowing smirk before excusing herself. Rio waited a few more minutes, her fingers twitching slightly on her lap, before clearing her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll be right back,” she said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She got up and left without waiting for a reply. She had a feeling Ralph was watching her movements, but she chose not to look behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cornered her against the door and locked it the second Rio walked into the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Took you long enough,” she said, nipping at Rio's jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Didn't want anyone to be suspicious,” she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and kissed her roughly, her nails scraping lightly down her sides through the opening of Rio's dress, which was also one of her own designs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, you look so fucking hot in this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned. “Mm, wore it just for you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha hummed and trailed wet kisses down Rio's neck in response.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sit on the counter,” she ordered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip as she obeyed. She pushed herself up onto the counter before she bunched up her dress around her waist and pulled her panties to the side a little before spreading her legs enough for Agatha to settle between them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you going to be quiet for me?” she asked, brushing her lips against Rio's.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want words, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, Agatha, I'll be so quiet—” She cut herself off with a sharp gasp when Agatha pushed two fingers deep into her and began to fuck mercilessly into her G-spot. “Agatha, fuck, fuck, fuck—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah-ah,” Agatha tutted, slowing her thrusts, keeping her fingers buried inside her. “Quiet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clawed at her wrist, digging her nails into her skin harder and harder until she growled and began moving her fingers again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're always such a good girl for me,” Agatha rasped. “What happened?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's just—fuck, you're fucking me so fucking good, and—” She did her best to bite back a moan when Agatha pressed the heel of her palm against her clit. “You always do, but right now you're—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clamped a hand over Rio's mouth and groaned low in her throat when she felt her hot, uneven breaths against it. She pressed her palm against Rio's clit and began to fuck her faster, the obscene, squelching sounds almost echoeing through the bathroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're close, aren't you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded, her moans muffled by Agatha's palm. Agatha sped up her thrusts again and adjusted her angle to fuck her even deeper. She kept that relentless pace until she felt Rio completely soak her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head slumped into Agatha's shoulder when she finally pulled her hand away from her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck,” Rio gasped. “You're fucking insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked as she wiped her hand on a tissue paper. “You're the one who drives me insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me make you come,” Rio rasped, sliding down from the counter on slightly wobbly legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “On your knees, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't have to be told twice. She got on her knees and pulled Agatha's panties down just enough to give her access. She spread Agatha's thighs further apart and smirked when she leaned against the counter, her fingers digging into the marble.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took the charm between her fingers. “Mine,” she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't deny it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tested Agatha's quietness with soft kitten licks at first. Agatha gasped sharply and immediately slapped a hand over her own mouth when Rio gently sucked on her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     She uncovered her mouth just enough to pant, “Harder.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked against her skin and did just that, letting her teeth graze slightly over Agatha's swollen clit before sliding her tongue down her slit and pressing it firm and deep inside of her. Agatha responded by letting go of the counter and fisting her hair, and Rio rewarded that by taking her clit between her lips again and plunging two fingers deep into her, fucking her with relentless strokes until she broke, her legs shaking and her heels slipping slightly on the marble floor.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips, panting, before taking her dripping fingers into her mouth and sucking them clean with a satisfied moan. She stood up and ran her fingers over Agatha's swollen folds, but she grabbed her wrist and gently pried it away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and kissed her swollen lips. “Later, darling. They're going to get suspicious out there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pouted. “But—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Behave and I'll let you make me come as many times as you want later. I promise,” Agatha said, pulling her panties back up and bunching up some tissue paper to wipe at her slick thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a dramatic sigh, Rio nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait here for a little bit,” Agatha said, fixing Rio's hair and smudged lipstick.
    </p>
    <p>
     The look on Ralph's face when Rio came back to the table
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     whispered suspicion. She pretended not to notice.
    </p>
    <p>
     As promised, Agatha somehow managed to get rid of him to spend the night at Rio's apartment. They didn't sleep much.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      . . .
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned twenty-six a month later. Agatha had obviously given her the day off, and she was planning on sleeping in, but instead she was awoken by Agatha walking into her room and climbing onto her bed at seven in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wake up, birthday girl. I got you a gift.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sunk further into her pillow. “If it's not your pussy, I don't want it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted and kissed her neck. “You'll get plenty of that later.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you waking me up for sex or not?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ugh. So no.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tugged at Rio's wrists until she was on her back, ignoring her grumbles of protest, and placed a box in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cracked an eye open. “What—”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed the tip of Rio's nose. “Open your eyes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grumbled again as she sat up and finally opened her eyes. In her hands sat a box with an iPad of the newest generation inside.
    </p>
    <p>
     She gasped. “Agatha, what the fuck?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You always tell me how you wish it was easier to tweak things on your sketches after you've drawn them. Having this is going to help a lot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head. “I can't take this. Absolutely not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can, and you will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, this is so fucking expensive. I can't just take it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes. “Well, good thing I can afford it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That doesn't mean you should just buy me an iPad,” Rio argued.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took the box from her hands and set it aside before she kissed her softly. “Rio, I wanted to, so I did. You deserve it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, I don't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha brushed the tip of her nose against Rio's. “Do you have any idea how happy you've been making me these past few months?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't know how to reply to that. She definitely needed treatment for her chronic lesbian panic.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and grabbed the bag she was hiding behind her back. “And this is your second gift.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, you're fucking insane. You gave me an iPad. And now you're giving me another gift?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grinned. “There are twenty-four more gifts, actually. You're twenty-six today, which means twenty-six gifts.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her gaze flickered to a pile of bags in the corner of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're joking.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head and handed her the bag. “Open it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Inside was a high-quality sketchbook along with multiple sketching pens and a full set of Copic Sketch markers.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “In case you get tired of the iPad,” Agatha said. “I know you're so used to doing it the traditional way, so I thought you'd appreciate those too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her response to that was to set her gifts down onto the floor and pull Agatha into a rough kiss. Agatha straddled her lap and smirked against her lips as she let Rio yank the buttons of her shirt open and toss it across the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm, this is a good way to thank me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sat up just enough to allow Agatha to pull her shirt off, revealing her bare chest. Agatha hummed contentedly and squeezed her breasts, flicking her hardened nipples with her thumbs. She kissed Rio roughly again before sliding down her body and pulling her panties off, tossing it behind her along with Rio's shirt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's breath was hot against her already soaked folds, and she pressed a wet kiss to her inner thighs. Rio fisted her hair and dragged Agatha where she wanted her, being immediately rewarded by a firm flick of her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, you're—”
    </p>
    <p>
     A loud knock sounded at the door, followed by an even louder, “RIOOOOOOOOOOOOO!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled and smirked against her skin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're bu—” She gasped when Agatha licked a long stripe up her slit. “Shit. Fuck. We're busy!”
    </p>
    <p>
     A beat of silence. Then, in unison, “Oh.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a deep breath when Agatha kissed her clit. “Go away, please!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen and Alice cackled embarrassingly loud before stepping away from the door just in time to probably not be able to hear the moan that Rio let out when Agatha sucked hard on her clit and pressed two fingers deep into her, immediately crooking them against her favorite spot.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, yes, right there—right fucking there,” she gasped, her grip on Agatha's hair tightening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned at the pull. “I know, darling,” she purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     She began pumping her fingers faster and swirling her tongue harder, turning Rio into a gasping, moaning mess, her feet kicking uselessly around Agatha's body. Agatha lightly grazed her clit with her teeth and twisted her wrist slightly, and Rio's orgasm hit her almost immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed her clit and inner thighs a few more times before sliding back up her body and kissing her roughly, letting her taste herself on her tongue. “Happy birthday, darling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She rolled her hips slightly, letting Rio feel the wetness seeping through her slacks, before climbing off of her lap, making Rio whine at the loss.
    </p>
    <p>
     She came back with a small box and straddled her lap again. “And here's your third gift.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio eyed it briefly before looking back up at Agatha. “Why are you still wearing pants?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and kissed her roughly before climbing off of her again and kicking her slacks and ruined underwear off. “Happy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pulled Agatha back into her lap. “Mm-hmm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Open your new gift, then. To show some appreciation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio ripped it open. Under the wrapping paper was a wand vibrator. Much fancier looking than the one she owned.
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't say anything before she handed it to Agatha and spread her legs wider again.
    </p>
    <p>
     What Rio learned from gifts four through fifteen was that Agatha had spent more money in sex toys than she had spent on the iPad. That and the fact she'd have to hibernate for approximately twenty-six years to recover.
    </p>
    <p>
     Gifts sixteen through twenty-four were designer clothes that Rio felt she wasn't even worthy of looking at.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha Harkness was absolutely insane. And Rio was insanely in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She had her face buried on Agatha's chest when Agatha whispered, “You still have two more gifts.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her. “Agatha, no. You've given me so much already.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I've already bought them.” She kissed the top of her head. “Get dressed. Wear the short dress I gave you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm taking you for a drive. For your last gifts.” She kissed the corner of Rio's mouth. “Come on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio got up with a lazy groan, her legs still trembling slightly despite the fact she had last come a few hours before. She slid on her new dress and a pair of short boots, and turned around to see Agatha already dressed and staring at her with an almost dumb looking smile.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head. “Nothing. Just looking at you. You're beautiful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed Rio one last time before taking her hand and dragging her out of the apartment and into her SUV that was parked in front of the building. Rio had never seen her drive, now that she stopped to think about it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Don't worry, darling. I'm a good driver.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The drive was mostly quiet. Agatha kept one hand on the steering wheel and other on Rio's thigh, caressing it softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     When she parked at a small, secluded dirt road, the clock marked 11:13pm. For whatever reason, Rio hadn't glanced at the clock before they left. She had no idea it was already this late.
    </p>
    <p>
     A small sign near the road read “Beaver Creek”.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha got out of the car and opened the passenger door for her. “Come on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She took Rio's hand and walked her to the edge of the hill the road sat at. The view was absolutely insane.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What is this place?” she breathed. “Jesus, this is beautiful.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wrapped her arms around Rio’s waist and kissed her shoulder. “This is part of gift twenty-five.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. “Part?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Mm-hmm. Do you want to know what the other part is?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Obviously.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get back in the car. Push your seat back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obeyed immediately. She was expecting Agatha to straddle her lap, but instead, she crawled into the small floor space and kneeled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, what—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her down slightly and draped Rio's legs over her shoulders. She didn't give Rio any time to adjust before she licked into her, pushing her tongue past her entrance and curling it relentlessly, feeling Rio's walls flutter around it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, fuck, fuck—Agatha, slow down, fucking—” she gasped, her breath already coming in sharp, uneven pants.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only doubled down, sliding her tongue up her slit and sucking hard on her clit, humming at the feeling of it through over her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's head slumped against the fogged up window and she fisted Agatha's hair tightly, yanking hard on it, pulling her impossibly closer despite how sensitive she was.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, holy shit—you're going to—” she gasped, unable to form full sentences. “So fast—please don't stop, I'm—”
    </p>
    <p>
     With one final deep thrust of her tongue, Rio came hard, her slick flooding Agatha's tongue as she kept fucking her through it until Rio pushed weakly at her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha wiped her mouth with the back of her hand and promptly climbed up her body, straddling her lap. “And this was gift twenty-five.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio panted against her mouth. “You're absolutely fucking insane. You're not human.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed her deeply, letting her taste the last of her orgasm on her tongue, before pulling back and whispering, “I have one more.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled breathlessly. “Agatha, you—”
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned around slightly and pulled a sleek envelope out of the glove compartment before handing it to her. “Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head in disbelief as she carefully opened it. She pulled out a heap of documents and flipped through them with wide eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     Two first class tickets to Paris. A week long stay at the best suite at the Four Seasons hotel. And two VIP passes to Paris Fashion Week.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her mouth. Then closed it. And then opened it again. Closed it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “A few months ago I made a promise to take you to Paris if you stayed with me. Thought it'd be fitting to give those to you as a birthday gift. Plus, we both know how it went last time that we shared a hotel room.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, I—
     <em>
      what the fuck
     </em>
     . You're—you didn't have to—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shut her up by kissing her deeply. “Happy birthday.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They ended up staying at Beaver Creek for a few more hours before finally heading back. They were both completely spent when they got under the blankets after a warm shower.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you enjoy your day?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm,” Rio hummed, nuzzling into Agatha's chest and throwing an arm around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed the top of her head. “I thought so. You look happy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded lazily against her chest. “Might have been the company. Might have been the insane amount of orgasms my company gave me in the last twenty-four hours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She tilted her head upwards slightly so that Agatha could press a soft kiss to her lips before nuzzling back against her chest, sighing contentedly, already drifting off.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Love you,” Rio mumbled groggily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha froze. She waited for Rio to take it back, say she didn't mean it. But it was clear that she had passed out the second the words came out of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stroked her hair as she whispered, “I love you too.”

     Chapter Summary
    </p>
    <blockquote>
     <p>
      Fourth only to eating Agatha out, fingering her and fucking her with a strap, in any order, Rio's favorite thing in the world was to have the privilege to clean her up. Maybe seventh, actually, behind Agatha eating her out, fingering her and fucking her with a strap, also in any order. Still, feeling Agatha twitch under her as she drank up whatever wetness had spilled was a blessing and something that Rio would do all day, every day if she could. The latter was already true, but the all day part depended on Ralph being sent into outer space.
     </p>
     <p>
      Agatha snapped her fingers in front of her and cleared her throat. Right. She could figure out the logistics of sending Ralph to space later.

    <p>
     Rio was alone in bed when she woke up the following morning. She sighed and reached for her phone, expecting to see a text from Agatha telling her that she had to leave to go back to Ralph, but there was nothing there. She was about to text Agatha herself when she heard a familiar laugh coming from the kitchen, and her eyebrows furrowed. She rubbed her eyes and got out of bed slowly before walking out of her room, not bothering to fix the mess that was her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     And there Agatha was. Standing in her kitchen, wearing one of Rio's shirts, sipping a cup of coffee and laughing about something with Alice and Jen. She turned her head and smiled as soon as she saw Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning, pretty girl,” Agatha said softly, extending her arms and pulling Rio into a hug as soon as she approached.
    </p>
    <p>
     With her head buried in Agatha's shoulder, Rio looked up and pouted. “I missed you in bed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed her softly. “You were out cold. Thought it'd be mean to wake you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You could've stayed there with me until I woke up,” Rio whined.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen cleared her throat. “We're still here, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm. Good morning to you too,” Alice said, narrowing her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was just telling your friends about all the gifts I gave you yesterday,” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “You—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice waved a hand dismissively. “Don't worry, pornstar. We stopped her before she could give too many details.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't call me that in front of her,” Rio snapped, shooting her a glare.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen chuckled and Rio buried her face in Agatha's shoulder again with a groan. Agatha kissed the top of her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But,” Agatha drawled, “I saved the last one for you to tell. Figured you'd like to have the honors.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen and Alice cocked their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled before saying, “We're going to Paris together. Just the two of us. For Fashion Week.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They gasped. Loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No fucking way,” Jen said.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What do you have that I don't?” Alice muttered. “Actually, no. Maybe it's safer if you don't answer that. Not sure if I'd like to know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio mouthed a “sorry about them” to Agatha and she chuckled before tilting Rio's face up to kiss her. Alice and Jen shrieked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're
     <em>
      still
     </em>
     here,” Jen reminded her.
    </p>
    <p>
     They eventually pulled apart, and the four of them sat down for breakfast. Never in a million years Rio thought that this would happen. Alice and Jen obviously liked Agatha and were more supportive than she ever thought someone could be, but the four of them having breakfast together was a line Agatha had never even mentioned crossing. Just to be an asshole, though, Agatha occasionally slid her hand under the table and ran her fingers dangerously close to the waistband of Rio's panties. Because of that, Rio dragged her into her room as soon as they were done with the dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
     They both giggled as Rio backed Agatha toward the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You were cute trying to act normal,” Agatha murmured. “And
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kissed her deeply and straddled her lap as soon as Agatha landed on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you want them to watch?” Rio asked, brushing her lips against Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, no,” Agatha groaned. “You're mine. I don't even want to think about anyone even seeing you like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moaned quite pathetically at that and tugged her shirt off over her head before reaching for Agatha's.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha waited until they were done a while later to quietly ask, “Did you mean what you said last night?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. She had no idea what Agatha was talking about. She suspected it could be about how she told Agatha she'd let her fuck her non-stop for twenty-six years. Looking back, that was a little dramatic and not humanly possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     She only managed a low, “Huh?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha tucked a stray strand of hair behind Rio's ear. “You said you loved me. Before you fell asleep.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Shit. Fuck. This was obviously much worse than the sex for twenty-six years fiasco.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” she said softly. “It's okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     It wasn't okay, Rio thought. There was a very specific rule about this. She prepared herself for Agatha to say that she didn't, couldn't, feel the same way.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you mean it?” Agatha pressed gently.
    </p>
    <p>
     She swallowed hard before simply nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled. Rio frowned again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love you too. More than you know. You're not like the others, Rio,” she admitted. “You have me more than anyone has ever had.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had to pinch herself. Agatha chuckled and grabbed her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     She sighed. “But I have a child. And I have an idiot husband who's technically the father of that child. And who would do anything to take that child from me if he lost me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Silence. Rio wasn't sure if she knew what was happening.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I'll find a way. Eventually. It won't be now, might not even be soon, but I promise I'll figure things out. I want to be with you. More than I've ever wanted to be with anyone else. I really mean that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha stroked the back of Rio's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We can get married, you know. After everything's settled with Ralph.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean—if you want to,” she added quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you serious?” Rio asked, her eyes widening.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha cocked her head. “I've never been more serious about anything. But if you don't want to, it's—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously? Of course I want to. What the fuck, Agatha? Are you—” She cut herself off to chuckle in disbelief. “What the fuck. I'd marry you
     <em>
      right now
     </em>
     if I could. You can't just—like, say that you want to marry me, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed her to shut her up. Rio smiled as she melted into the kiss and cupped Agatha's face. Agatha started shifting to straddle her lap, but Rio pulled away. Agatha groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha. I mean it. Like, are you being serious? You'd actually marry me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of replying, Agatha clicked her tongue and slipped out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tried to reach for her with a whine. “Where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'll see.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She walked over to Victoria's enclosure. She had never explicitly told Rio she liked her, but Rio had caught her feeding her a few times over the past few months.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha carefully lifted the lid, Victoria scuttled onto her rock and tapped her legs against it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is she going to bite me?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled. “Maybe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “
     <em>
      Rio
     </em>
     .”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Relax. She likes you,” she said softly. “But I'd still take my hand out of her house if I were you. It's her nap time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grunted and grabbed two twigs she found at the base of the enclosure. She gave them a quick test to make sure they were soft enough to bend without snapping before putting the lid back on.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you have scissors?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned, but still nodded and pointed to her desk. “First drawer.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grabbed the pair from scissors and walked back toward the bed before sitting down next to Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, give me your hand,” Agatha said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I still don't know what you're doing,” Rio said as she gave her her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'll see,” she said again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She measured the twig around Rio's ring finger before clipping it and bending it into the shape of a ring. When she was satisfied with the result, she slipped it onto Rio's finger and kissed her knuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio still wasn't sure if she knew what was happening. Was this a proposal? She had never been proposed to. She hoped that this was a proposal. She felt a little lightheaded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned in and kissed her multiple times, all over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, now you do it,” Agatha eventually said, handing her the other twig along with the pair of scissors. She slid her actual wedding ring off and placed it on Rio's nightstand.
    </p>
    <p>
     With trembling hands, Rio repeated what Agatha had just done. Did this mean that they were unofficially married? Agatha had never stopped referring to her as a sex witch. Was this how witches got married in the past? Were they witchy married in some way?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her hand and kissed her knuckles again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This isn't official, obviously,” she said. “But whenever we're together, just the two of us, I'll wear this instead.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's brain was absolute mush. She'd definitely die whenever Agatha made a real proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And,” Agatha drawled, “we'll be having our unofficial honeymoon in Paris. Do you like the thought of that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her only reaction was to straddle her lap again and kiss her deeply. She was so stupidly in love with Agatha Harkness that it hurt a little.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      . . .
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     A few days later, they were alone in Rio's apartment, laying in her bed. She was resting her head on Agatha's chest as she threaded her fingers through her hair. Eventually, Agatha cleared her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “There was something else I wanted to give you for your birthday,” she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked up. “You gave me twenty-six gifts. What else would you even be able to give me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of answering, she nudged Rio gently so that she could get up. Rio whined and pouted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't leave.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled and kissed her softly before making her way to a bag she had left in the corner of the room. Rio hadn't questioned her about it, because they hadn't seen each other in two days and they had more personal and important matters to tend to first. She padded back to the bed and dropped the bag in front of Rio.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I chose not to because I didn't know if you'd be into it and I didn't want you to feel like you had to say yes just because it was a birthday gift. But I've been thinking about it a lot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. “What is it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Open it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Quite carefully, Rio obeyed. Inside the bag was a harness, along with a fairly small green strap.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's mouth went dry. “Okay. I've just never used that, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded and kissed her softly. “I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips. She was admittedly stupidly wet. But she was even more stupidly nervous. “I—uh—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't have to,” Agatha said quickly. “I won't make you do anything you're not completely sure about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want it. I just don't know if I'll like it, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you don't like it, we'll stop the second you ask me to. You don't owe me anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'll tell me what feels good and what doesn't. And if you just don't like it at all, we'll never do it again. I'll even throw it away if you want me to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio managed to dress surprisingly slowly given how turned on she was. Her nervousness probably played a huge part, she guessed. Agatha watched her closely as she also took her clothes off and stepped onto the harness. She fished onto the bag for a bottle of lube and placed it onto the nightstand. Rio had somehow missed that.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips. “You look good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked more than good, but Rio wasn't sure if she could manage more than three words right now.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and took Rio's hand and guided her back to the bed, settling her against the headboard.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me if you need anything, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. Agatha ran her fingers through her hair and kissed her softly before grabbing the bottle of lube from the nightstand and squeezing a generous amount onto her fingers. She slicked the toy with it before pouring some more and leaning in to kiss her softly again.
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached between Rio's legs and she spread them instinctively. Agatha slowly pressed her slick fingers inside and carefully scissored her open.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I love your fingers,” Rio moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and kissed her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You remind me of that often,” she said with a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     She withdrew her fingers slowly. Rio whined and grunted at the loss.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Squeeze my hand if you need to,” she said, lacing their fingers together. “Two squeezes in a row, I'll pause. Three, I'll pull out. You're in charge.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio gave it a testing squeeze and Agatha nodded approvingly. “Perfect. Just like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed her softly again before asking, “Ready?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Yes. Please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her open with two fingers. “Breathe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn't even noticed she was holding her breath. She felt a little stupid. She only realized she was still holding her breath when Agatha leaned down and kissed her softly. She felt really stupid. When her brain finally started functioning a little again, she forced herself to breathe out, and Agatha nodded and kissed her softly again as she lined up and slowly and carefully pressed just the head of the toy in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio forgot how breathing worked again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck,” she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyes locked onto hers. “Are you okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     A part of her wanted to tell Agatha to fuck off, because she hadn't squeezed her hand, so of course she was okay, but she couldn't really form that many words right now. She nodded frantically.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled. “Breathe for me, then.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio did, somehow. When that happened, Agatha pushed a little deeper.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Still okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded frantically again. She managed to keep her breathing steady as Agatha slowly bottomed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good fucking girl,” Agatha praised. “Can I move?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “God, yes. Please. Fuck, I love this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and began thrusting slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so good for me,” she breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio could only nod again and arch into her, and that was enough of a response for Agatha to pick up the rhythm a little.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took her eyes off of her face for a few seconds to watch the strap go in and out. Her breath hitched.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, Rio, you look so good. You're taking me so fucking well,” she groaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio whined. “Close—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded and kissed her hard, groaning when Rio gasped into her mouth. “I know. Let me have it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She slipped her free hand between them to rub light circles over Rio's clit. Rio began moaning more desperately and buck her hips onto her, and Agatha let her set the rhythm and kept it until Rio came with a choked sob. She kept rolling her hips into her as she rode it out before finally squeezing her hand three times, and Agatha carefully pulled out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a few deep breaths to steady herself. “Fuck. Okay. Yeah. We should've tried this sooner. What the fuck.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled and kissed her softly before brushing her hair off her sweat-damp forehead. “You are the bestest girl in the world. I'm so proud of you and how well you took me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nuzzled into her and sighed contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know,” Agatha said, “you always moan so pretty. But this was something else. I should record you next time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled and buried herself further into Agatha's neck. “Stop. You're going to make me want to go again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Doesn't sound like a bad idea.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Of course it wasn't a bad idea, so they went again. A few times.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha held her close once she tapped out and ran her fingers through her sweat-damped hair until her breathing evened out, leaning in to kiss her a few times. Rio honestly felt like she was a whole new woman with a whole new body.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me get you some water,” Agatha eventually said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let her go with a whine. She wished she didn't have basic human necessities so that Agatha could just stay holding her forever and ever.
    </p>
    <p>
     She, however, took that opportunity to lay on her side and grab her phone. With a smirk, she opened the group chat she was in with Alice and Jen.

    <p>
     They'd be flying to Paris in a couple of hours, and Rio was at Agatha's house selecting the last looks that she was going to wear throughout the week. They were dangerously close to each other, chuckling about a comment Agatha had made, when the walk-in closet's door creaked behind them. Rio quickly took a few steps back until she was standing at what she deemed was a safe distance, and Agatha cursed under her breath when Ralph walked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Am I interrupting something?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't sure if this meant that he was suspicious or not. She cleared her throat and stared down at her own feet instead of replying.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just picking the last looks for Paris,” Agatha said quickly. “Rio said she would quit if I embarrassed her in front of all her favorite designers.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph nodded. Rio let out a chuckle and he turned to face her. Fuck.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know,” he said, “you must really be special. Agatha never took a stylist on trips like these.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've already told you, Ralph,” Agatha cut in. “She worked so hard during awards season. Right after designing for a movie, too. It's the least that I can do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph nodded. Before he could say anything, Agatha continued, “Besides, I like having company. And I'm sure she'll appreciate Fashion Week way more than you would.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph nodded yet again, but his gaze lingered on Rio for a few seconds too long. She had a feeling that he was going to catch up soon. Judging by the look in Agatha's face, she echoed that sentiment.
    </p>
    <p>
     She cleared her throat. “I should get going. I need to get my things and I still haven't picked the designs I want to take with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll walk you out,” Ralph said quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I—you don't have to. I know my way around the house,” she said, forcing out a chuckle.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I insist.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She looked at Agatha, who shrugged and mouthed a “just act normal”. As if that was doable.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So?” Ralph asked, raising an eyebrow and walking toward the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. Of course,” Rio said quickly. “I'll see you at the airport, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They were quiet as they walked through the house. When they stopped at the front door, however, Ralph cleared his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So, Rio. Is your boyfriend okay with you traveling with your boss like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “My—what?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She followed his gaze down to her collarbone, littered with faint bruises. She hated herself for forgetting to cover that, but she hated Ralph even more for staring at them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh. No. It's complicated,” Rio said quickly. “Nothing serious.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He doesn't mind, then?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio forced out a laugh. “I don't know why you're asking me that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's just that I was looking through the hotel reservation Agatha had made and I noticed she only booked one room,” he said calmly. Too calmly. “Just not sure if whoever you're seeing would be fine with that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard. “I—uh. No. That must be a mistake. I don't know anything about the hotel, but it wouldn't make any sense for us to share a room. Absolutely not.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph, I don't know what you're thinking, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just thought it was odd. You know, two women sharing a hotel room for a week…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wanted to lock him in a hotel room with no food or water for a week.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry. I don't know what you're trying to imply, but like I said, I can assure you that we're not sharing a room.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not trying to imply anything,” he said. “Just—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph, I really have to go. You can ask Agatha. I'm sure it's just a mistake. I have no reason to share a room with your wife.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She opened the door and left before he could even nod. For the first time in a while, or maybe even ever, Rio was legitimately scared that he knew something.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     She met Agatha at the airport a few hours later. Thankfully, Ralph hadn't come with her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled as she slid into the seat next to her in the lobby. “Hey, pretty girl. Are you excited?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio couldn't resist the temptation to nuzzle into her neck a little and kiss her jaw. “Mm-hmm. But…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled away to look at her and raised an eyebrow. “But?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard. “I think Ralph knows something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned. “God, is that about the hotel room?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked. “You knew?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He started talking about it after you left. Said you couldn't explain why there was only one room. God, he's so fucking annoying. He books one room for him and Jeff all the time, says it's ‘
     <em>
      boys' stuff
     </em>
     ’. And I don't question him about it. Not to mention that this was him snooping through my stuff.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. “He does what, now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugged and ignored what Rio's question was actually about. “Listen, if he actually knew anything, we wouldn't be here right now. Relax, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't going to relax, but she nodded anyway. She had something else in mind already. This week wasn't about Ralph, after all. She checked her phone. They still had a few minutes before they had to board.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “There's one thing I've never done at an airport.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha turned to look at her with a knowing smirk. Five minutes later, Rio was pressed against a stall door, covering her mouth with her hand, with Agatha kneeling down between her legs.
    </p>
    <p>
     If she wasn't so tired, Rio would've also told her that she never had sex on a plane either, but she decided to leave that for their flight back and settled for spending the whole flight sleeping with her head on Agatha's shoulder and Agatha's hand in her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     When they arrived at the hotel, Rio had to take a few deep breaths. This looked even more insane than the photos she had spent hours staring at. Agatha was absolutely insane for giving this to her, she thought. But she was insanely in love with Agatha, so they were even.
    </p>
    <p>
     Once the bellboy who helped them with their suitcases was gone, Rio sprawled herself on the bed. She could lay here forever. With Agatha on top of her, preferably.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her and smiled. “Happy?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Insanely so,” Rio replied. “Would be even happier if you joined me, though.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With a smirk, Agatha padded toward the bed and straddled her lap.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Needy already?” she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio looked up at her and nodded. “I thought this was supposed to be our unofficial honeymoon.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned down and trailed wet kisses up her neck. “Mm. You have a good point.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She kissed Rio roughly and let her tug her shirt off before reaching behind her to unclasp her own bra. She rolled her hips down onto Rio's stomach with a groan. They were still both wearing pants, so they didn't feel much, but it was still enough for both of them to moan into each other's mouths.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?” Rio breathed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah?” Agatha asked, rolling her hips down harder.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you bring yo—
     <em>
      our
     </em>
     strap?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Of course I did.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard before asking, “Would it be okay if I wore it this time?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. Of course. Why wouldn't it be?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know. You're used to people who know what they're doing, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you want to fuck me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't even know if I'd be good at it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not what I asked,” Agatha said softly. “I want to know if you want to fuck me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, yes, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Then you will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I have no idea what I'm doing, and I don't want to disappoint you, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Agatha whispered, gently reaching for Rio's wrist. “Stop. You don't have to know anything. I'll help you. You wouldn't ever disappoint me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Sweetheart,” she said gently as she stroked Rio's wrist with her thumb. “I wasn't born knowing how to do it either.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Okay.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'll beg, if you need it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You'll beg either way.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Yeah. True.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and kissed her again, threading her fingers through her hair, before getting out of the bed and opening her suitcase. She searched around it for a bit before pulling out the strap and harness along with a bottle of lube.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stood on shaky legs and walked up to her on even shakier legs. Agatha kneeled in front of her and smiled as she unbuttoned Rio's jeans and pulled them down along with her panties. She kissed just above Rio's clit and batted her eyelashes at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't tease,” Rio warned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just giving you some motivation.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She slipped the harness up Rio's legs and tightened it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is this okay?” she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't exactly sure what it was supposed to feel like, but she nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not too tight?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smiled and took a proper look at her. “God, okay. Fuck, you look even hotter with that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio could respond — not that she could come up with anything right now —, Agatha grabbed her hand and dragged her toward the bed. She settled against the headboard and spread her legs slightly before pouring some lube onto her fingers and immediately pressing them deep inside of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     She locked eyes with Rio and Rio moaned. Agatha smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? Do you like watching me do this?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded. “Fuck. Yes. A lot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's smirk widened. “Come get your girl.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio climbed onto the bed in front of her and positioned herself as best as she could. Agatha poured some more lube onto her fingers and slicked the length of the strap with it.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Alright,” Agatha purred. “Show me what you've got.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Nothing much, probably, Rio thought.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha caught her hesitation and smiled softly. She brought the head of the strap to her entrance and nodded at Rio. “Go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     With a deep breath, Rio pushed forward.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bit her lip and nodded approvingly. “Yes. Slow. Let me get used to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When Rio moved again, Agatha moaned sharply. “Yes, Rio, fuck. Just like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That gave her a small confidence boost, and she adjusted her angle slightly as she bottomed out. Agatha moaned again, louder and more desperate this time, and bucked her hips up onto her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, Rio. Good girl. You're fucking me so good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't exactly doing much, she thought, but okay. She definitely had a slight praise kink, she had learned over the last few months. Logically, she followed the rhythm of Agatha's hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha gasped sharply. “That's it. You're such a fast learner. My good girl with her cock inside me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, shit. Fuck. Rio's brain was a few seconds away from short-circuiting. She tested rolling her hips slightly when she bottomed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned. Loudly. Frankly, Rio wasn't sure if she had ever heard Agatha, or anyone, moan that loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, okay, fuck—do that again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obeyed, thrusting out slightly and then rolling her hips in small circles every time she pushed back in. She repeated that movement a few times, and Agatha's moans became more frantic with each one.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, fuck,” she gasped between desperate moans. “I'm not going to last—I'm already so fucking close, I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio slowed down instinctively. “Should I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha slapped her ass hard enough to make Rio hiss. “No, goddamn it! Go harder even, please—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio somehow managed to get her brain to work and did as she was told. She grabbed Agatha's hips and began to thrust harder and faster, ignoring the way her thighs were burning.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, she wasn't sure if it'd be embarrassing or hot if she came from the sounds Agatha was making.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come—fuck.” Agatha gasped and swallowed hard before continuing, “Come with me, please, please, please—”
    </p>
    <p>
     So there was her answer.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reached out between them to touch herself, but stopped short. “You do it. Please. Rio, fuck.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's fingers immediately found her clit, and she rubbed it in fast circles until Agatha screamed under her. This was definitely going to earn them a noise complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a few more thrusts, Agatha came hard, sobbing out Rio's name and clawing at her back. Rio followed right after, and that was going to earn a spot in her ranking of best orgasms she's ever had. Her brain wasn't working too well right now, but if she could guess, it was easily a top five. She pulled out slowly and collapsed next to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha took a few deep breaths before bursting into laughter. She snorted loudly as her shoulders began to shake.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked and managed to prop herself up onto her palms. Agatha's laughs kept growing more frantically, and she frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snorted and covered her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right,” Rio whispered. “Cool. That's just great.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She pushed herself up and unbuckled the harness. Agatha was still laughing uncontrollably next to her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I knew I shouldn't have tried,” she muttered. “I ruined it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That snapped Agatha out of it. “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're laughing at me,” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha immediately pushed herself up. “Fuck. Rio. No, no, no. Fuck. Oh my god, I'm so fucking sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha, it's fine. Whatever. I told you I didn't know what I was doing. You don't have to like it,” Rio said, starting to slip out of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha immediately reached for her. “Rio. Baby. Fuck. No. You don't—fuck. I wasn't laughing at you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was laughing because my sweet little strap virgin fucked me so good I didn't know what else to do. Fuck, Rio, I swear. No one has ever fucked me like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio still didn't reply, so Agatha straddled her lap and trailed soft kisses all over her face.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I mean it. I've never—
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     . I'm not messing with you. You left me speechless. My ears are ringing. Do you have any idea what you just did to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally smiled again. Agatha didn't let her say anything as she kissed all over her face again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so wearing that again,” Agatha breathed. “Just—give me a few minutes. And then you're going to fuck me again. Slower. Maybe. Unless I beg.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned. “You definitely will beg.”
    </p>
    <p>
     On their fourth night in Paris, Rio made Agatha squirt with her strap. That earned her the best head anyone had ever gotten, along with the long-awaited call from the front desk about six different guests having complained about the noise coming from their room.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
     Their last day came too fast.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio had been popular every single day. Her recent works had gotten so much more attention than what she had imagined they would, and stylists and designers from all over the world wanted her contact so that they could eventually work together. Agatha was more than happy for her, and she kept finding very creative (and sexual) ways to reward her every night when they got back to their hotel room.
    </p>
    <p>
     This time, however, Rio was talking to a girl whose name she didn't really catch. She did catch, though, how the girl's gaze kept flickering down to her breasts every few seconds during their short conversation, and how her fingers lingered when they shook hands. She also didn't catch how Agatha was staring at them, her jaw clenched.
    </p>
    <p>
     Later, a few minutes into the last show of the day, Rio leaned over and whispered, “That dress is fucking insane. Do you see how—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha scooted a little to the side. “Mm-hmm.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. “What's wrong?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nothing. Just pay attention to the show,” Agatha said flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's frown deepened, but she did as she was told. She made a few attempts to talk to Agatha throughout the day, but all of them went ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't say a word on the drive back to the hotel either. Rio leaned over to kiss her jaw a couple of times, but Agatha's only reaction was to pull away without making eye contact.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you going to tell me why you're treating me like that?” Rio asked as Agatha closed the hotel room door behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't know what you're talking about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You haven't even looked at me all day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugged, still not looking at her. That called for drastic measures, then.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio unzipped her own dress and stepped out of it, leaving herself only in her panties (Agatha's favorite pair, obviously) before collapsing into the bed with a dramatic sigh, spreading her legs open a little. Agatha barely spared a glance at her, choosing to stare at a stain on the wall instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Looks like you had a great time tonight,” she finally said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio propped herself up on her elbows and tilted her head. “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That girl you spent hours talking to. She wouldn't take her eyes and hands off of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hadn't talked to her for more than two minutes, and the only time she had her hands on Rio was to shake her hand, but having Agatha act possessive was extremely and embarrassingly hot, which meant the only logical response was to take advantage of it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did you like how she was looking at you? How she wouldn't stop staring at your breasts?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio twirled a strand of hair around her finger and bit her lip. “Maybe.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked again and spread her legs a little wider. “Maybe I should've gone back home with her. She really wanted me to.” She pouted. “I bet she would have treated me like a good little slut, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you think this is funny?” Agatha snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled. “I think it's hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snarled something under her breath and turned around to grab something from her suitcase, stomping toward the bathroom before Rio could see what it was. Rio groaned as she collapsed back onto the pillows. Her plan had flunked so bad that it made her want to hop on a plane back to Salem and hide there for a few decades.
    </p>
    <p>
     A few minutes later, Agatha stepped out of the bathroom, still buttoning her jeans back up. Rio frowned at the movement before her eyes caught the slight bulge under the fabric. She bit her lip to stifle a moan that would've probably gotten then kicked out of the hotel otherwise. The good news was that her plan had worked and she was about to get her insides rearranged. The bad news was that she didn't think she would be able to avoid getting a call from the front desk over that. She took the phone off the hook.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hummed as she crawled to the edge of the bed, where Agatha was now standing, and hooked her fingers under the loops of Agatha's jeans, tugging until Agatha was standing between her legs. She looked up at her as she kissed the bulge through the fabric.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio batted her eyelashes as she unzipped Agatha's jeans. “Were you planning on walking around like this until you're no longer pissed off at me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha didn't respond, and Rio pulled her jeans down fully to reveal that Agatha's panties were now gone and that she was wearing a much bigger strap than the one she had brought. Rio was more than definitely about to get her insides rearranged, and she lifted her own hips just enough to quickly yank her own panties off and toss them behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know,” Agatha murmured, “I was going to reward you with this new gift I so kindly bought you, but—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cut her off by spitting on her own palm and thoroughly stroking the entire length of Agatha's strap. She giggled when Agatha's breath audibly hitched.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I think I gave you a better reason to use it on me,” Rio purred. “Feels like the perfect way to remind me who I belong to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha growled and pushed her into the bed, crowding her and crawling over her body until Rio's back was pressed against the headboard. She reached over behind Rio and grabbed a pillow and shoved it between the headboard and the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio glanced up at it and bit her lip. She considered calling the front desk to warn them that she was fine and that calling the cops would be dramatic. She ran her fingers through her folds with a breathy moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha reached for her hands and pinned them to the bed. “Hands off. That's mine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled. “Yes, ma'am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Keep them there,” Agatha growled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded with a smirk. She was so wet that she was sure she was dripping down onto the sheets already.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moved a hand down to Rio's stomach and another to the base of the strap. Rio gasped and arched into her touch.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't sure if Agatha wanted her to beg, but she still breathed out a series of pleases. Whether she had been waiting for that or not, Agatha cut her off halfway through what she was fairly sure was her thirteenth please by pushing the strap fast and deep into her, bottoming out before Rio could even register it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio immediately moved her hands to try and claw at Agatha's back, but she caught her wrists with a growl and pinned them to the bed again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I said, keep them there,” she grunted, picking up the pace further. “Unless you want me to tie you up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled. “I actually—fuck. Want that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow and slowed down a little. “What was that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tie me up,” she purred, trying to grind down. She groaned in frustration when Agatha held her down. “Please?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Slut.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Open your mouth.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio giggled again and obeyed. Agatha took her hand off Rio's stomach and grabbed her jaw, holding her as still as possible as she kept thrusting, and let a long, warm string of saliva drip down onto Rio's waiting mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Swallow,” Agatha said, letting go of her jaw with a light shove.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obeyed with a muffled moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Let me see your tongue.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stuck her tongue out. Agatha smirked, and whatever comment Rio was considering making was scrapped when Agatha kissed her hard and licked into her mouth. Good, because Rio probably wouldn't be able to come up with anything other than multiple variations of pleas for Agatha to fuck her so roughly that they'd owe the hotel a few thousand dollars for a new bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grunted into her mouth when she adjusted her angle to allow herself to fuck Rio even deeper. Rio shrieked and wrapped her legs around Agatha's waist as best as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Is this what you were picturing that bitch doing to you?” Agatha asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Words, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Fuck, no.” She took a deep breath before continuing, “I don't—can't think about anyone fucking me but you—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah? And why is that?” she asked, punctuated by a string of deeper, faster thrusts.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because I'm yours,” Rio choked out. “Only yours. All yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck yes, you are,” Agatha growled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded frantically. “Only yours. Completely yours. Fuck. Yours, yours, yours, yours, yours—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha growled again and let go of her wrists to rub tight circles over her clit. She had to use her free hand to cover Rio's mouth when she came screaming so loud that her ears rang a little. She let Agatha fuck her through it until the overstimulation almost made her shriek with every thrust. Agatha pulled out with a low grunt and collapsed onto her, panting heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus. Fuck,” Rio eventually choked out. Her throat felt a little raw. “You're—God, I love you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nipped at her jaw. “I love you more. And I love knowing you're all mine. And I love your mouth, and your fingers, and your pretty pu—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck me again,” she cut in. “Please. Shit, that was fucking insane.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked against her skin. “Yeah? You liked that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm-hmm. A lot. I should let other women look at my breasts more often,” she purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     With a growl, Agatha lined up the toy again. Rio jolted when it brushed against her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck,” she gasped. “Sensitive. Way too sensitive. Holy shit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was still so turned on she could explode, so she bit her lip and whispered, “Can I fuck you with it too?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked, already shifting to slip the harness off. “I thought you were never going to ask.”
    </p>
    <p>
     When they tapped out hours later, there were a few puddles of cum around the bed and drool in one of the pillows. Rio was fairly sure they wouldn't be welcome in this hotel when they returned to Paris for their
     <em>
      official
     </em>
     honeymoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was quiet now. Too quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha noticed. She always noticed. “What's wrong?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head and sighed. “Nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's not nothing. Talk to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed again. “It's just… having to go back to our normal lives again. Only having you to myself sometimes. Having to hide again. I hate it.” She paused. “I'm not trying to start a fight. I'm just tired.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, baby.”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Baby
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sorry,” Agatha said quietly. “I know I keep telling you that I'll get a divorce. But I promise that it will happen. Eventually. Soon. I just need time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     God, Rio wanted to believe her so bad.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha caressed her cheek with her thumbs and kissed the tip of her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I'm really scared that Ralph will find out,” Rio muttered. “I don't want to lose you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You would never lose me,” Agatha replied. “And he's not going to find out. Trust me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     The look on Agatha's face, however, told her that she wasn't so sure of that herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha bit her lip. “Listen. Ralph will travel in two days and be away for a week. I was thinking, maybe you could stay at my house. Just… work like normal. Come back when Nicky is asleep. Stay with me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That was crossing yet another line. Rio didn't say anything.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It feels fair,” Agatha continued. “I'm at your place all the time. I want you to stay at mine too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally nodded and let her kiss her again. On days like these, she had actual hopes that Agatha was telling her the truth and that they'd eventually be together. Truly together. No worries, no Ralph. Just them and Nicky. Rio still wanted to be his other mom, if he'd allow her to.
    </p>
    <p>
     On their flight back, Rio finally told her about how she had never had sex on a plane, and so Agatha took care of that. Rio wasn't sure if Agatha would be up for doing that every time they traveled, but
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     surely would. She'd bring that up on a later date, she decided.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      . . .
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     Staying over at Agatha's when Ralph was away became routine. She'd leave after work, and come back once Nicky was in bed. They always remained careful. Rio would only leave Agatha's bedroom once they were sure Nicky wasn't around to catch her leaving, and she wouldn't stay the night before Ralph's return, and they'd go back to hiding and staying at Rio's when he was around. Rio tried to not care. She tried to tell herself that Agatha would get a divorce soon and they'd move to a small cottage in the middle of nowhere and be together forever and ever. Just the two of them and Nicky. And Victoria. And maybe a real Señor Scratchy, if Nicky still liked bunnies by then.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it became tiring, and they were soon having small arguments almost every time that Rio had to leave. Sometimes, they weren't so small, and they wouldn't talk outside of work for a few days. Agatha would earn Rio's forgiveness by sending her gifts that mostly consisted of sex toys and lingerie, but sometimes she'd be a little more romantic and send her flowers instead. They'd always end up in a bed together a few hours later, with Agatha promising over and over that she'd start looking for a divorce lawyer soon. Obviously, she'd never actually do it. Rio was starting to lose hope, but she didn't want to lose Agatha, so she'd keep forgiving her and giving her more time over and over.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph had been away for two weeks this time. Agatha woke her up every day with kisses, food in bed and promises that soon enough, all of their days would look like this. Rio almost believed her. Ralph wasn't flying back until the evening, so Rio got to have one more morning with her. It felt too peaceful.
    </p>
    <p>
     That was until a sinking feeling stirred Agatha awake. Something told her to check her phone. She took a quick glance at Rio, who was sleeping comfortably next to her, before grabbing her phone from where it rested on the nightstand.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      05:15am
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Just letting you know that the meeting we had with some investors today got cancelled, so we're heading back early. Should land at 7. Can't wait to see you and Nicky.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     She threw her phone back onto the nightstand and shook Rio awake.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get up. Get out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grumbled something under her breath and buried herself further into the blankets. Agatha shook her again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have to go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned and blindly reached for her phone to check the time.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you seriously going to kick me out at seven in the morning?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha yanked the blanket off of her. “Ralph's coming home early. You need to go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you—seriously? You told me he wasn't going to be back until tonight.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And now he told me that he's coming home early. So get your shit and go.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio growled as she finally got up and started picking up her clothes off the floor. “You're unbelievable. You just spent the whole night begging for me to fuck you over and over and now you're just kicking me out like that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Can you keep your voice down? Nicky is home.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's lips curled. “God forbid he finds out what his mommy does while daddy is away, right?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignored the jab and grabbed her wedding ring from the drawer and slipped it on.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “Yeah. Better make sure your precious husband doesn't know you didn't wear that shit for a whole week.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, don't start.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't start, don't start, don't start,” Rio echoed. “I wouldn't be starting anything if you'd just kept your promises for once.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just need time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You always say that,” Rio snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You knew it was going to be like this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn't know that I'd be falling in love with an idiot who only cares about me when her husband can't fuck her right.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not what this is. I love you too. You know that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     love you. You love fucking me and having me whenever you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you really think that's all this is?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's what it looks like,” she said dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I give you everything,” she snapped, her own voice rising now. “Money. I buy you whatever you want. I lie to my husband for you all the time. What else do you even want from me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want you to love me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I do lo—God, fuck it. You don't want to believe me? Fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I would believe you if you didn't make it so hard for me to!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm just trying to do this the right way! Why is it so hard for you to understand that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're trying to do what's right for
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     . You don't give a shit about what I think or how I feel, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “Of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grabbed her bag and left the bedroom without another word. She made it a few steps into the hallway before almost stumbling over Nicky, who was standing near the door clutching Señor Scratchy. Her stomach twisted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Miss Rio?” he mumbled quietly, rubbing his eyes. “What were you doing in mommy's and daddy's room? And why were you and mommy yelling?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She crouched down and ran a hand through his hair. “We weren't yelling, buddy. We were just… talking really loudly. Did we wake you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded sleepily.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed. “I'm so sorry, okay? We didn't mean to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why were you in mommy's and daddy's room?” he asked again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Instead of replying, she asked, “Can I take you back to your room? It's still really early.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked like he was about to question her for the third time, but he couldn't hold back a yawn. He nodded and let Rio take his hand and walk him back to his room. She tucked him under the covers and ran a hand through his hair again before crouching down next to his bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Nicky, can we keep this just between us? Your dad doesn't have to know that I was here, okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He frowned. “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because if you tell him, he will ask a lot of boring questions.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Daddy doesn't like secrets,” he mumbled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's not a secret. It's just—” She cut herself off with another sigh. “He wouldn't like it if you told him I was here either.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She smiled weakly. “Grown-up stuff. You don't have to worry about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     His frown deepened.
    </p>
    <p>
     She reached for her bag and fished around it for the KitKat she had been planning on eating later. “Tell you what. If you don't say anything to him, you can have this. It's like… a game.”
    </p>
    <p>
     That earned her a grin and a nod. Rio put the KitKat inside his bedside table drawer before she kissed the top of his head and whispered, “Good kid.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mommy likes it when you're around.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm sure she does.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio ruffled his hair one last time before getting up. “Don't forget about the game, yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded sleepily again, already buried in his blanket and half-asleep. Rio smiled faintly and left the room, quietly closing the door behind her before rushing out of the house, praying the whole way that Agatha had stayed in her room. She decided she'd write her two-week notice as soon as she got home.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio slammed the door behind her as she walked into her apartment. Alice and Jen looked up from their bowls from where they sat at the dining table.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good morning,” Jen tried to call out, but Rio had already headed into her bedroom and slammed that door shut too.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen exchanged a look before getting up and walking toward Rio's bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen knocked once. “Rio? Can we come in?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sobbed out a muffled, “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen opened the door slowly. Rio was already buried under her blanket when they walked into her room.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What did she do now?” Alice asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hated how obvious it was that it had had something to do with Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “The usual.”
    </p>
    <p>
     They were silent for a few seconds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “We're taking you out,” Jen said firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are we?” Alice asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen shot her a glare and elbowed her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right,” Alice said quickly. “Yeah. Of course.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't want to go out,” Rio whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes, you do,” Jen said. “We'll go to this awesome lesbian bar after dinner, and you'll get yourself a woman that is single and child-free, and you'll forget about Agatha Harkness for a few hours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not in the mood, Jen.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on,” Alice said. “We'll have fun. You can't just rot in bed like that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Jen kissed the top of her head. “Get some rest. You'll need a lot of it to enjoy your night.”

    <p>
     Rio nodded begrudgingly and Jen adjusted the blanket over her. Alice patted her shoulder and they left quietly. She ended up getting a lot of rest, and she was only awoken by her phone buzzing repeatedly on her nightstand.

     <em>
      I'm sorry for earlier.

    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      You know I hate fighting with you.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      I was angry and scared. I didn't mean to kick you out like that.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed and stared at the screen for a while before replying.

    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at her phone and scoffed before throwing it across the bed. She wasn't going to fold this time.
    </p>
    <p>
     She groaned when it buzzed again a few minutes later. The notification on her lockscreen showed that Agatha had sent her a photo, and she had a good idea of what was in it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Predictably, it was Agatha in a new set of lingerie. Dark green lace. Beautiful. Rio could see Agatha's hardened nipples under the top as well as a small wet patch in her panties. There was probably a real life statue based on this photo at the heaven's gate. The thoughts that she had about it, however, were probably enough to send her straight to hell. She saved the photo to the folder where she kept all of the nudes and semi-nudes Agatha had sent her and made sure that her favorite vibrator was fully charged for later.

     Rio cursed under her breath. She was so fucking stupid.

     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hated her. But hate sex seemed
     <em>
      especially
     </em>
     hot right now for whatever reason, so… she grumbled something under her breath and got out of bed. She was still wearing that morning's clothes and she decided to stay that way, as she wouldn't need anything on her body very soon anyways.
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen were in the kitchen when she walked past.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Alice called out. “We were going to let you sleep and call you when dinner was ready. You were sleeping so peacefully, and—where are you going?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Change of plans,” Rio said, already reaching for the door knob. “I'm sorry. You two go have fun.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen exchanged a look.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio,” Jen said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's fine,” Rio lied. “We'll talk it out and fix it. We always do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “She's never going to learn if you keep forgiving her,” Alice argued. “Go out with us. Come on. Just this once.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Next time, okay?” she said, because of course there'd be a next time in like, three days, give or take.
    </p>
    <p>
     They exchanged another look before nodding. By now, they knew that trying to keep Rio from seeing Agatha was useless. She left and locked the door behind her before she could change her mind. Not that that was humanly possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio unlocked Agatha's front door with the key Agatha had given her when she first started sleeping over. Agatha had said it was only fair, since Rio had also given her the key to her apartment months ago. Rio suspected it was also so that Agatha could wait for her naked in her bedroom without having to risk leaving the front door unlocked. And because she really wanted to see Agatha naked right now, she reached her bedroom in record time.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha, however, was not naked. Instead, she was wearing one of her robes, letting it hang open just enough to reveal some of the lace underneath. She got up from where she was sitting cross-legged at the edge of the bed with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I missed you,” she whispered. “I knew that photo would make you forgive me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I hate you,” was Rio's simple reply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's smirk widened. “But you still came. Which means you still want me. So I win.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, fuck—” She cut herself off with a grunt and pulled Agatha forward by the front of her robe and kissed her roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha giggled into her mouth and went to pull her robe off, but Rio grabbed her wrists with another grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so angry,” Agatha purred. “It's really hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're fucking sick.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grinned and bit back a moan. “Mm, that's the tone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god. Does pissing me off actually turn you on?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugged. “I mean, you turn me on in general… but yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio growled and yanked Agatha's robe off, tossing it somewhere in the room. She had to take a few steps back to stare at her lingerie in person. She swallowed hard at the sight.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're drooling,” Agatha pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     If it wasn't for how beautiful her moans sounded, Rio would gag her with her lingerie. She stepped closer to her again and hooked her fingers under the bra straps and was about to just rip it open when Agatha grabbed her wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Wait, wait, wait, wait,” she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio growled. “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “I bought you another gift too.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't want your stupid gifts,” she grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come on, Rio,” she cooed. “Be the good girl you always are and close your eyes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio growled again before relenting. She heard Agatha step away for a few seconds before approaching her again. She grabbed each of Rio's wrists individually and made her hold her arms out before placing a box on her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. Open.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio obeyed. She stared at the box.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can open the box too, you know,” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     She did so with a grunt. Inside rested a big, thick strap. It looked much bigger and thicker than the ones Agatha had. She stared at it for an embarrassing amount of time before looking back up at Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha twirled a strand of hair around her finger and licked her lips. “Do you like it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard instead of replying. Agatha moved closer and tucked a stray strand of hair behind Rio's ear. “I said, do you like it, pretty girl?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio took a step back and snapped the box shut and threw it onto the floor with a grunt. It landed with a soft thud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted. “You're terrible at showing gratitude.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio went to pull at the straps of Agatha's bra again, but Agatha once again stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What now, Agatha?” Rio growled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “This was really expensive. Be gentle,” she said, dragging out the last vowel. It only made Rio want to rip it even more, but she obeyed and unclasped it open instead.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're such a good pup—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio cut her off with a growl that definitely wouldn't come from a good puppy and pushed her toward the bed. Agatha went willingly and with a wide smirk. She sat at the edge and spread her legs in a way that allowed Rio to see the enormous damp spot in the middle of her panties.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Gentle,” Agatha reminded her when she hooked her fingers under the waistband.
    </p>
    <p>
     Begrudgingly, Rio pulled it down gently when Agatha lifted her hips slightly. Agatha let it slip from one of her legs and lifted the remaining foot to allow Rio to take it off.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held the ruined fabric between her fingers. It was slightly heavy from the amount of slick in it. Rio didn't even know that was possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oops,” Agatha cooed. “I got a little carried away.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed and threw it somewhere behind her. Agatha ran her fingers through her hair and spread her legs a little wider.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you just going to appreciate the view, or—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her teasing was cut off by a sharp gasp when Rio dove in and licked a hard stripe through Agatha's slit, moaning at the wetness that coated her entire tongue. This was Rio's favorite taste in the whole world. She wished she could turn it into some type of condiment. Agatha getting divorced and them moving in together so that they could have sex at every waking hour would also work, but that seemed a little less doable nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
     She lapped at her clit hard and fast a few times before quickly and firmly dragging her tongue down and pressing it inside with a satisfied groan. She was just about to swirl it when Agatha pulled her back by the hair, making her growl in frustration.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus,” Agatha gasped. “Slow down.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ugh. Why?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're going to make me come way too fast.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. “Yeah? That's the point.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She tried to dive back in, but Agatha held her in place. “Ah-ah.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What the fuck is your problem?” Rio growled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “My problem is that you and your mouth are the best things that ever happened to me, and I'd love to enjoy the moment and not come in under thirty seconds, if that's alright with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, you're so—fuck. I swear I'll edge you for the rest of your life if you don't stop doing this shit.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “You sound so mean when you're this horny. Say it again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I am
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     horny,” Rio grunted.
    </p>
    <p>
     She was so horny she could keep her tongue inside of Agatha for a few hours. Whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I can see you rubbing your thighs together, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's gaze flickered back to her own thighs. She hadn't even noticed what she was doing. She forced herself to stay still.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Now,” Agatha drawled. “Be a good girl and go slow. Enjoy what I'm giving you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Before Rio could reply, Agatha pushed her back between her legs. She kept her hand in her hair and pulled her toward her clit, sighing contentedly when Rio flicked it with her tongue. Rio tried to move back down to her entrance, but Agatha held her still.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop dragging me around like I don't know what I'm doing,” Rio growled. “You're acting like I don't spend hours eating you out every single day.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm micromanaging,” Agatha said smugly. “It's really hot. If you behave, maybe I'll let you give it a try.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're such a fucking asshole.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She tugged Rio back by the hair again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's not very nice…” She clicked her tongue. “I like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, if you pull me off again, I—you're so fucked.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and pushed her between her legs again, directing her to her entrance this time. Rio groaned and pushed her tongue deep, and Agatha dug her nails into her scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, Rio, you're unreal,” she moaned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grinned at the praise and flicked her tongue into Agatha's favorite spot. She let out a low, surprised gasp when Agatha tightened her grip on her hair and pushed her even further into her cunt. Rio flicked her tongue harder and Agatha moaned loudly and angled her hips so that Rio's nose was pressed against her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stay—fuck. Stay there. Don't you dare move,” Agatha gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't going to move anyways, but Agatha held her head still. Rio felt a little lightheaded and almost considered asking for air, but Agatha just felt too good clenching around her tongue, and she tasted even better.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, fuck, fuck, fuck, your tongue is so fucking deep, so warm, so wet—fuck, I'd keep you there forever if I could—”
    </p>
    <p>
     She trailed off when Rio began to nod furiously against her grip. The combination of the friction of Rio's nose against her clit and of the perfect swirling of her tongue inside of her sent her over the edge with a loud moan, broken only by her desperate gasps when Rio kept licking her unrelentlessly through her orgasm. Rio groaned when she felt it coat her tongue all over, and she suddenly felt much calmer. She wondered if Agatha's cum had some antipsychotic properties. Maybe she should send it to research. She'd gladly be the test dummy.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha finally pulled her off by her hair, Rio was panting so heavily that she was coughing and her lungs felt like they were on fire. She kissed Agatha's knee softly and dropped her forehead against it to catch her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
     They were silent after that. Eventually, once they had both caught their breaths, Agatha looked down at her soaked thighs and pouted. “You made such a mess.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio lifted her head slightly and raised an eyebrow. “You're welcome.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha clicked her tongue. “No, no, no. You can't just leave it like that. That's bad manners.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She spread her legs wider again and angled them so that Rio could see a line of slick dripping down the inside of her thighs.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio licked her lips and chuckled. “God, you're—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yours,” Agatha cut in. “Now… go on.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Fourth only to eating Agatha out, fingering her and fucking her with a strap, in any order, Rio's favorite thing in the world was to have the privilege to clean her up. Maybe seventh, actually, behind Agatha eating her out, fingering her and fucking her with a strap, also in any order. Still, feeling Agatha twitch under her as she drank up whatever wetness had spilled was a blessing and something that Rio would do all day, every day if she could. The latter was already true, but the all day part depended on Ralph being sent into outer space.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha snapped her fingers in front of her and cleared her throat. Right. She could figure out the logistics of Ralph to space later.
    </p>
    <p>
     “So?” Agatha asked, tilting her hips up slightly and raising an eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip, analyzing the situation, before settling for a particularly wet spot near Agatha's folds. She leaned in and inhaled deeply with a shaky moan. She was only opposed to turning Agatha's scent into a perfume because Rio was the only one ever allowed to smell it.
    </p>
    <p>
     She hummed as soon as the slick coated her tongue. Agatha sighed contentedly and ran her fingers through her hair, stroking her scalp.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're such a good girl,” Agatha said with another content sigh. “Fuck, I love you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded against her skin and licked another slow stripe, now downwards to where some cum had spilled along the crease of her thigh. She inhaled again when she had reached an area where most of it had pooled. She repeated this process over and over until Agatha pulled her off, more gently than last time.
    </p>
    <p>
     She tilted Rio's head up and caressed her cheeks with her thumbs. “Hey…”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head slightly to kiss one of her thumbs before looking back up at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you still angry at me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio bit her lip before muttering, “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned down to kiss her softly, her thumbs still stroking her cheeks, and Rio smiled against her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Come here,” Agatha whispered when they pulled apart. She scooted back toward the headboard with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's legs were slightly numb when she rose to her feet and climbed onto the bed and crawled over to Agatha to straddle her lap before kissing her roughly. One of Agatha's hands quickly slipped under the waistband of her jeans and pressed down onto Rio's cunt over the fabric of her soaked panties, making her moan into Agatha's mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so wet,” she purred.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No shit,” Rio breathed. “Fuck me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and tugged Rio's shirt off before making quick work of her bra. Rio's head dropped back when Agatha took one of her hardened nipples into her mouth and sucked greedily. She was about to slip her hand back under Rio's jeans when her phone rang on the nightstand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Rio whined. “Leave it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha leaned back on her elbows to reach for her phone. Rio whined again and chased her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” she grunted. “Come on. What could possibly be so important that—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled away. “What?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ralph is calling.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio frowned. “You are not going to take his call right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have to. I never miss his calls.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio tried, but she was already swiping to accept the call.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey, baby,” Agatha said quickly. “Yeah. No, I'm fine.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head and scoffed before getting out of the bed. Agatha mouthed a “sorry” and tried to reach for her, but Rio distanced herself. She could hear Ralph babbling about the game from the other end of the line, and she just didn't want him to get hit on the head by the ball because that would traumatize Nicky.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish I was there to see him,” Agatha said. “I'll have to join next time.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio snarled under her breath before pulling her pants down along with her panties and tossing them somewhere in the room. She bent down and grabbed the box with the strap from where she had thrown it earlier and gave it a quick glance before attaching it to the harness it came with and slipping it on, adjusting it around her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked up at her and licked her lips before stammering, “Y-yeah. I'm glad you two are having fun. I—uh, tell him that I love him, yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes narrowed as she approached the bed again.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded along to something that Ralph had said. “Okay, uh—Ralph, baby, someone else is calling. I have to take that. I'll talk to you later, okay? Have fun. Love you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't wait for a reply before hanging up and tossing her phone back onto the nightstand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously?” Rio asked in a low growl. “You had your fingers inches away from my pussy and you stopped touching me to talk to your husband and tell him that you love him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shrugged. “That's called being responsible, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hands and knees. Face the mirror,” Rio snarled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha obeyed with a smirk, wiggling her lips slightly as she got on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I take this as you being angry at me again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio responded by settling behind her and grabbing her hips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you like knowing he has no idea you're about to get fucked like a whore?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tsked. “Words.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's smirk widened. “Fuck yes, I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Tell me something else, Agatha,” Rio whispered, running the head of the strap through Agatha's folds.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm?” Agatha hummed, arching her hips into her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio steadied her and pushed in with a rough, fast thrust. Agatha gasped sharply and her arms almost gave out under her, so Rio slipped an arm under her chest and held her up until Agatha regained a fraction of her motor skills, never stopping her rough thrusts.
    </p>
    <p>
     When Agatha tried to look away after a thrust that rammed right into her most sensitive spot, Rio grabbed a fistful of her hair and held her still.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Ah-ah,” she tutted. “Eyes on the mirror.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded against her grip.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You—” Agatha gasped. “You wanted to ask me a question.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked. “Smart girl.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She rewarded her memory with a few harder thrusts before asking, “Have you ever thought about me while Ralph is fucking you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “All the time,” Agatha gasped. “I always think about you. Only you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Does his cock make you come like mine does?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know it doesn't,” Agatha managed between moans.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes. But I want to hear you say it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha swallowed hard when Rio buried the strap to the hilt and kept it there. “Say it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She closed her eyes, trying to focus, and Rio tugged hard on her hair again. “Say it, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck, Rio, you—Ralph's cock doesn't make me come like yours does. Never has. Never will.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio started moving again, keeping her thrusts slow as she held Agatha into place to keep her from grinding into her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, baby, I'm so close, please—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” Rio purred. “That's the point. I thought you said you wanted to enjoy the moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I've—fuck. Fuck you. I've enjoyed it enough.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked and hummed. “I have another question.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay,” Agatha managed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Has
     <em>
      any
     </em>
     cock ever made you come like mine does?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Rio, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, what?” Rio pressed, punctuating her question with a particularly hard thrust that made Agatha sob.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No one—no cock has ever made me come like yours. Please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And who do you belong to?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You. Only you. Always you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Good girl. Was it that hard?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally rewarded her by speeding up her thrusts again and by using her free hand to rub tight, harsh circles over her swollen clit. Agatha came almost immediately, screaming Rio's name so loud that her throat burned. Rio fucked her through it until Agatha began to whimper at every drag of the strap against her sensitive walls.
    </p>
    <p>
     She rested her head on the mattress and coughed a few times from how hard she was panting, whining at the loss when Rio pulled out with a loud squelch and took a few deep breaths before lifting her head again and looking back at her, wiggling her hips just enough to tease her. She moved a hand between her legs and ran her trembling fingers through her soaked and swollen folds with a breathy whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio immediately smacked her hand away. “Ah-ah. Not yours to touch.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and wiggled her hips again. “Mm, fuck me like that again and I'll stop.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Haven't you had enough? You—” She cut herself off with a groan and squeezed her eyes shut. “Get on your fucking knees. Right now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's smirk widened as she climbed off the bed on wobbly legs and got on her knees. Rio sat at the edge and held the strap in front of her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Clean it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha giggled at the command and ran her tongue through the entire length before taking it into her mouth. Rio fisted Agatha's hair tightly before pushing her further into the toy, groaning when Agatha gagged as she thrust it into the back of her throat. Her grip tightened when Agatha began to bob her head faster and spit began to drip down her chin.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I don't understand, Agatha. You let me fuck you until you're screaming. You suck your own cum off my cock like a filthy slut. And you still act like I mean nothing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha moaned something unintelligible between the gagging noises she was making. Rio frowned and yanked her back by the hair so hard she gasped. A thin string of saliva connected her mouth to the toy, and Rio collected it with her thumb before pushing it into Agatha's mouth. She let Agatha suck on it for a while before pulling it free with a wet pop.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What did you say?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That you're everything,” Agatha rasped, trying to reach for the strap again. Rio yanked her back again with a growl.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say that again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're everything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio let go of her hair with a light shove. “Get back on the bed. On your back.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grinned again as she obeyed, climbing back up onto the bed, her legs already spread wide.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Close your legs,” Rio ordered as she unbuckled the harness and threw it onto the floor with a dull thud.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted. “I spent so much time deciding which one to get and you're only going to give me one orgasm with it?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're lucky I even gave you one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed Agatha's hair and pushed her further into the bed as she climbed over her. She stopped right above Agatha's mouth and looked down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you going to be a good girl and make me come?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha licked her lips and nodded. “Yes, ma'am.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She tightened her grip on Agatha's hair and sank down. Agatha moaned and flicked Rio's clit briefly before running her tongue down and pressing it into her entrance. Rio gasped sharply and smacked the headboard. Agatha swirled her tongue inside of her and Rio moaned so loud that if there was anyone in the next room, they surely would've heard it. Agatha buried her tongue deeper and shifted slightly so that her nose would press against Rio's clit and Rio began to roll her hips faster and pant heavily between moans.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck. I hate you. I hate your mouth. I hate how you fuck me,” Rio gasped, tightening her grip on Agatha's hair.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha groaned, and the vibration made Rio's head slump into the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, fuck you,” Rio whined. “I'm so fucking close already, I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and tapped Rio's inner thigh twice, which was their cue for air. Rio lifted herself off with a grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha licked her lips. “Are you still pissed at me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shifted to look down at her. “Did you seriously stop eating me out to ask about my feelings?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow, waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio groaned. “Yes. Furious.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pulled her back down and ran her tongue through her folds. “Doesn't taste like it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “God, just shut up and fuck me,” Rio growled.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha giggled into her, the vibration making Rio smack the headboard again and curse under her breath, before finally latching onto her clit and sucking hard. Rio gasped sharply and gripped the headboard with her free hand until her knuckles whitened.
    </p>
    <p>
     “If you stop again, I swear I'll tie you to this bed and leave you for Ralph to find.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ducked down just enough to purr, “You think more about my husband than I do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio growled and fisted her hair tighter, pulling her back between her legs. Agatha giggled again before splitting her folds with a firm swipe of her tongue and dragging up to circle her clit with a groan, making Rio throw her head back and squeeze her eyes shut.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fucking—fuck. Harder.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha obeyed and began to flick Rio's clit relentlessly. Rio sped up the roll of her hips until they burned.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio felt Agatha shift under her, followed by a loud moan that made her shudder. She took a quick glance back to see Agatha pumping her fingers hard and fast into herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously?” She gasped when Agatha pushed her tongue inside again and swirled it against her favorite spot. “Are you touching yourself while you fuck me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kept her tongue out as she nodded frantically. The movement made her nose rub Rio's clit relentlessly, and Rio's legs almost gave out as she came hard. Agatha fucked her through it until she came herself, panting heavily into her. Rio sighed contentedly as she climbed off and collapsed on her back.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Still angry?” Agatha asked smugly, licking her lips. She ran her fingers through her chin to collect what remained of Rio's orgasm and licked them clean with a satisfied moan.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smacked her thigh in warning. “Don't push it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha grinned. “Sit on my face again and I'll shut up.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio turned her head toward her. “You're the most depraved person I've ever met.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you came on my face while I fingered myself. After you railed the shit out of me with a strap. After you almost bit my clit off. So what does that make you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio chuckled despite herself and tilted Agatha's face toward her with two fingers before kissing her roughly. “You drive me fucking crazy, you know that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Right back at you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha giggled against her lips before shifting to straddle her lap and deepening the kiss as she began to drag her still soaked folds over Rio's abs.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Again?” Agatha purred. “You know you want to.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You need help.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I need to get fucked again,” Agatha corrected, licking a stripe along Rio's neck before nipping at her jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's hands tightened around her waist and she rolled her hips a few more times, moaning when her clit caught on the firm muscle of Rio's abs, before getting off her lap with a smirk.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Where the fuck are you going?” Rio growled, trying to reach for her.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ducked out of reach and grinned as she looked over her shoulder. “I thought I was pissing you off.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I was enjoying myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “You mean you were about to come just from me riding your stomach?”
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Yes
     </em>
     .
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Relax, darling. Just getting something.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes narrowed when Agatha bent down to grab the strap. “I have hands, you know.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I have a few hundred dollars less in my bank account because of this, and I think you should be a little more grateful and put it to good use,” she purred. “Unless you're not into being ridden with it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Get back here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha practically dragged herself over, the harness dangling from one of her hands. She held it in front of Rio and smirked when she snatched it and shifted just enough to be able to buckle the harness around her hips. Agatha licked her lips and straddled her lap again as soon as Rio was done.
    </p>
    <p>
     She rolled her hips over the shaft with a breathy moan. “Much better.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you waiting for?” Rio asked, raising an eyebrow.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For you to say please,” Agatha teased, batting her eyelashes.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and sighed dramatically. “Fine. Guess I'll have to sit here and tease myself until you do.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” Rio growled.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're so rude. You didn't even say thank you after I got up to grab your cock like a good whore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio hated her and how much her teasing turned her on. She felt like she could come from her words alone.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're not good.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “I can be. If you say please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha,” she growled again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Still not hearing it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grunted. “I'm not going to beg for that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay, then,” Agatha whispered. She rolled her hips down onto the shaft one last time before lifting herself slightly. “If you don't want me to ride your cock, I won't force you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     A part of Rio wanted to grab Agatha's hips and just push her down onto it, but she had to admit that this was slightly hot. And maybe a little fun.
    </p>
    <p>
     She rolled her eyes dramatically. “God. Fine. Please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “See? It's not that hard to be polite.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She leaned in to kiss Rio roughly as she gripped the base of the strap and ran the head through her folds before lining it up and sliding down slowly, moaning sharply into Rio's mouth as she took every inch until she bottomed out. She gave it one testing roll of her hips and cursed under her breath before stilling her movements.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grunted and grabbed her hips. “Move.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha pouted. “That's not very like you. Don't you want to tell me about how much you hate me first?”
    </p>
    <p>
     She trailed a few open-mouthed kisses up her neck and squealed into her skin when Rio snapped her hips up.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Something wrong?” Rio asked sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No—fuck. Nothing I can't handle,” Agatha gasped. She began to move her hips in sync with Rio's thrusts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio smirked and thrust up harder and faster.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Fuck—fucking hell. Okay. Maybe let me—”
    </p>
    <p>
     Her hips stuttered.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Keep up,” Rio purred, moving one hand to Agatha's hair and tugging hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha decided to distract her by wrapping two hands around Rio's throat and squeezing lightly. Rio's rhythm faltered. They had tried breathplay for the first time a few weeks ago, and it turned out they had been really into it. They also gave knife play a try that day, but Rio didn't trust herself with a knife right now, so she wasn't going to suggest that.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Something wrong?” Agatha asked, though she was still struggling with the rhythm. Rio honestly wasn't sure how she hadn't come yet. The same question applied to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
     She kept her hands tight around Rio's throat for a few thrusts before taking one hand off with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pouted immediately. “Hey. I was enjoying that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha chuckled. “Aw. Are you upset that your choking session got cut short?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Put your hand back where it belongs.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked and choked her a little harder with her remaining hand. “I need one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She slipped her hand between her legs and rubbed fast, tight circles over her clit with her fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
     “What are you doing?” Rio asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     She took a hand off of Agatha's hips and grabbed her wrist, but she fought against the restraint with a grin and began rubbing even faster. She kissed Rio roughly and moaned into her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio responded by tightening her grip on her hips and speeding up until Agatha could no longer keep her fingers on her clit without them slipping and began to practically scream into her mouth every time that Rio thrust up. She probably could gain more muscle mass from that than she could from going to the gym. She kept that pace until Agatha came hard, her whole body shuddering above her.
    </p>
    <p>
     She shifted to pull out when every movement began to make Agatha whine.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No, no, no, wait—” Agatha rasped. “Stay there.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow but obeyed. Agatha was still for a few seconds before she began rolling her hips in small circles.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously?” Rio asked. “Do you ever stop?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
     Despite the feeling that her legs were about to fall off, this wasn't a bad way to spend her night, so Rio wasn't going to argue.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eventually, Agatha exhaled contentedly and smirked against Rio's skin. “Again?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha only tapped out after Rio had had her on her back twice, followed by a round on her stomach. That one made her squirt and required a few minutes to recover, but it was followed by a round against the wall, with one leg wrapped around Rio's waist. She came so fast on that one that she was barely able to process the strap inside of her.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had been laying in silence for a while when Rio cleared her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I have to tell you something,” she said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha propped herself up on her elbows and raised an eyebrow. “Yeah?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard. “Nicky saw me this morning. After we fought.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sat up fully. “Excuse me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He asked me what I was doing in your room. And why we were yelling at each other. But I played it off and took him back to his room.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you didn't think of telling me this earlier?” Agatha snapped. “Do you realize that he's with Ralph right now and will bring it up to him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He won't say anything.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Did he tell you that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. I mean, yes—I gave him a KitKat. Asked him not to say anything in exchange for it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You bribed my son to cover for you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “To cover for
     <em>
      us
     </em>
     ! I was trying to protect you!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't get to decide how to protect me. Do you seriously think that bringing my son into this is okay?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn't bring him into anything!” she snapped. “I didn't know that he'd be standing there when I left.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I had told you to stop screaming.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You were screaming too! He said it himself!”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha sighed and pinched the bridge of her nose. “And the best thing you could come up with was to bribe him?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What else was I supposed to do? I wasn't even thinking—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “That's your fucking problem. You don't think. You just do whatever you feel like doing without thinking about the consequences, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh, fuck you, Agatha.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You involved my son in this. I can't believe you don't see how—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you involved me in your fucking marriage!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Do you have any idea what will happen if he tells Ralph?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He won't say anything. I told you, I handled it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You don't know that!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Oh my god, Agatha,” Rio groaned. “If he says anything, Ralph will leave you. Isn't that what you want?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “He'll take my son from me, Rio. Why don't you understand that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You can't keep putting all of this on me. You wanted me just as much as I wanted you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're the only careless one, though.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Me?” Rio snapped. “You were the one who had the idea of having sex in your house!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And you were never opposed to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio opened her mouth to speak, but nothing came out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're unbelievable,” Agatha muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio didn't hesitate this time. “And you're a fucking coward.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha flinched. She was silent for a while before whispering, “Get out.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Gladly,” Rio said.
    </p>
    <p>
     She put her clothes back on in record time and slammed the door shut behind her when she left. She did the same thing to the front door. She imagined Agatha probably heard the sound all the way from the bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't expecting to see Alice and Jen when she arrived back at their apartment, but they were sitting on the couch sharing a bowl of popcorn. They turned to look at her as soon as she closed the door behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “That was quick,” Alice pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop,” Jen whispered, smacking her lightly on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio swallowed hard. “Can we still go out?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice checked the clock. It was past eleven. “Now?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and squeezed her eyes shut when she felt herself start to tear up. “Please?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Alice and Jen exchanged a glance before nodding.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Of course,” Jen said, already getting up. “Just give us a minute.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She mouthed something to Alice before grabbing her wrist and hoisting her up. Rio sank down onto the couch and did her best not to cry while they were away, but her makeup was a mess by the time they emerged back from their bedrooms. Rio hated the look of absolute pity in their eyes. They'd always look at her like that when she'd come home from a fight with Agatha, but it was a little worse this time, so she didn't look at them again until their Uber driver dropped them off at the local bar.
    </p>
    <p>
     They had been there for a few hours, and Rio had no idea how many drinks she had had by the time she grabbed her phone to text Agatha.

     <em>

    </p>
    <p>
     Rio wasn't really expecting Agatha to be awake, but her replies came immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      03:52am
     </strong>
    </p>

     <em>

    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Are you okay?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     With a scoff, Rio opened her camera and sent Agatha a photo of the drink she had in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      03:53am
     </strong>
    </p>

     <em>

     <strong>

    </p>
    <p>
     <em>

    <p>
     <em>

    <p>
     <em>

    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      tho you're probably too busy with your husband so you don't really have time to think about anything else, right?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     That was when Alice reached over and tried to take the phone from Rio's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey,” Alice warned. “That's not—don't do that. Give me your phone.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio pulled her hand away to keep the phone just out of Alice's reach.
    </p>
    <p>
     <strong>
      03:54am
     </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Are you alone?
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     <em>
      Text me when you get home. Need to know you're safe.
     </em>
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed and handed her phone to Alice before the voices in her head could convince her to toss it out of the window.
    </p>
    <p>
     The rest of the night was a blur. At one point, she let a woman take her to the bathroom and mark her up a little. She stopped her when she pulled her panties to the side. Sex in bathrooms was restricted to Agatha. Sex was restricted to Agatha, actually. Alice and Jen dragged her into an Uber shortly after that and helped her shower and put her to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
     Predictably, her head was throbbing when her alarm rang early the following morning. She took some aspirin and got dressed with a few grunts, grabbing her sunglasses and slipping them on before she left.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed as she opened Agatha's front door and pushed her sunglasses to the top of her head. She was halfway through the living room when Agatha came up behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Hey. Didn't know if you'd come,” she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shrugged without looking at her. “Well, I still work for you, don't I?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her and sighed. “I was worried about you last night. You didn't text.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio ignored her and kept walking toward Agatha's closet. Agatha followed right behind and called out to her a few times, but she also ignored those attempts.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio moved through the racks and cleared her throat. “You said you wanted options for your interview this weekend. Do you want silver, black or purple?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I want to talk to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Well, I don't.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio. Please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She grabbed a black dress from Agatha's closet and handed it to her without making eye contact. “Try this one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     From this new angle, Agatha could see the bruise on Rio's neck. She frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Who gave you that?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio clicked her tongue. “Some girl at the bar. Didn't quite catch her name.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha paused. She hesitated before muttering, “Did you let her fuck you?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Without hesitation, Rio replied, “Yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha blinked and swallowed hard. “Was it good?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “I'm not going to discuss my sex life with you. Get changed, please.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha looked at her for a while before sighing. “Did you sleep?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Barely.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Me neither.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Not my problem,” Rio replied flatly. She turned around and grabbed a few pins.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Aren't you even going to look at me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Rio said coolly. “You don't get that today.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're not being fair.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm being honest. Which is something you should try to do sometime.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha exhaled shakily and took her clothes off. Rio turned her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Seriously? You've seen me naked more times in this year of us being together than Ralph has seen in the ten years I've been married to him.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Being together. Rio squeezed her eyes shut and stayed that way until she heard the rustling of fabric as Agatha stepped into the dress. She sighed as she pointed to the platform, already crouching down next to it with a few pins in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stand still,” she said curtly as Agatha climbed onto the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha obeyed, but looked down at her when she did. “Can you just stop for one second and talk to me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “There's nothing to talk about.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Please?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio ignored that and began adjusting the hem of the dress before shaking her head with a frustrated grunt.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stop pretending I'm not here.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm working,” she replied flatly. “That one looks like shit. Try the silver one.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio squeezed her eyes shut and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
     “I just want to explain—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I heard everything the first time,” Rio replied. “Can you please get changed?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know I hurt you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You do that often.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “And I'm sorry.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha. Get changed. This dress looks like absolute shit and I'd hate for everyone to think that your stylist no longer knows what she's doing.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha ignored her request and tilted her chin up with two fingers. “Look at me when I'm talking to you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Mrs. Harkness, for the last time, I don't want to talk to you,” Rio said curtly, although she let Agatha's fingers linger.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha's eyebrows furrowed. “Don't Mrs. Harkness me. We've been through too much.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio finally met her eyes, and was about to say something when Ralph walked into the room. She quickly slapped Agatha's hand away, hard.
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph's gaze shifted between the two of them. “Is everything alright?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and got up. “Just had her hand too close to a pin.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph frowned. “I don't see a pin—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “It's there,” Rio snapped. “You just don't know where to look.”
    </p>
    <p>
     His frown deepened and his gaze lingered a while longer before shrugging and turning back to Agatha.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You look beautiful,” he said. “You always do. Is this what you're wearing for your Vogue shoot?”
    </p>
    <p>
     The fact Ralph liked it made her hate the dress even more. She actually hated it so much that she could puke, though she suspected her hangover also had something to do with that part.
    </p>
    <p>
     “It looks horrible,” Rio mumbled. “She's not wearing that anywhere.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph raised an eyebrow. “I don't think it looks—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm her stylist, not you,” Rio said flatly. “And I'm saying it looks horrible.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He blinked. “I—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Rio, that's enough,” Agatha cut in.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio held her gaze for a few seconds before shaking her head and scoffing.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you sure you're okay?” Ralph asked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yeah. Peachy.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He nodded, unconvinced, before wrapping an arm around Agatha's waist and kissing her on the lips. Rio stared at them for a few seconds before turning back around. When she did, her hand accidentally knocked into the container where she kept her pins. It crashed onto the floor, sending pins everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Motherf—” She cut herself off with a groan. “Great. Just what I needed.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph immediately moved toward her, already crouching down and sweeping some pins onto his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't touch my things,” Rio snapped. She wanted to stab his dick with the pins until it fell off.
    </p>
    <p>
     He looked up at her and blinked. “I'm just trying to—”
    </p>
    <p>
     She didn't meet his gaze. “I said, don't touch my things. I dropped it, I'll clean it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph dropped the pins onto the table and held up his hands. “Alright. Jesus.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio sighed and swallowed hard before finally crouching down and sweeping the last of the pins onto her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     She finally looked up at him and said, “Sorry. I shouldn't have acted like that. Won't happen again.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Ralph nodded slowly. “Are you sure everything's alright here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was one question away from throwing him out the window. She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay. Well, I'll leave you two to it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     He kissed Agatha again before leaving and Rio squeezed her eyes shut and turned her head away.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Are you out of your mind?” Agatha snapped as soon as Ralph closed the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio shook her head. “Agatha, if you no longer want my opinions on what you should wear, I'll get going.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. You listen. Are you insane? Acting like that toward him, especially after he kissed me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “What did you want me to do? Clap my hands and cheer?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. I want you to act in a way that doesn't make you look suspicious. What the fuck is your problem?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Your husband is a fucking idiot. Do you really think he'll put two and two together just because I'm in a bad mood?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yes!”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're always saying he's never going to find out. And now you're scared?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I
     <em>
      am
     </em>
     scared. I have always been scared. I just kept it from you because I didn't want to worry you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Cool. That was a great vote of confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at her for a while before muttering, “You know, my behavior might be a good excuse to fire me. You're long overdue for a new girl to fuck anyways.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Don't you dare compare yourself to other women. You know you're nothing like them.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Because I don't let you walk all over me?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No! Because I love you in a way I've never loved anyone else. You know that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You have a funny way of showing it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You wanted this.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wanted you!” Rio exhaled shakily and squeezed her eyes shut. “You know what? I'm done. Fuck your dresses. Fuck you. Fuck your husband. I don't care.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She turned to walk to the door, but Agatha blocked her path.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Move,” Rio snapped.
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha did, but only to lock the door.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio blinked in disbelief. “Are you seriously going to lock me in here?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha crossed her arms. “Tell me what you want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio's eyes narrowed. “What—what I want?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded. “What do I have to do for us to go back to normal?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “Seriously?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha nodded again.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You know what I want.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Using Rio's phrase against her, Agatha said, “Yes. But I want to hear you say it.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Jesus Christ—you. I want
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     . And I want you to choose me. And I want you to love me more than you claim you do. And I want you to follow through with your promise of divorcing your husband, and—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Okay,” Agatha interrupted. “So kiss me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio tilted her head and blinked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Kiss me,” Agatha repeated. “I want to prove to you that I'm not scared of him. This is me choosing you.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “Is this your idea of a grand love gesture? Do you seriously think that kissing me will fix everything you've said and done?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “No,” Agatha admitted. “But I think that it's the first step.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're out of your fucking mind.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “Probably,” Agatha said with a shrug.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio stared at her in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
     “But I'd get worse if I lost you,” Agatha whispered. “I don't know who I am without you anymore, Rio.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She was not going to fold, she was not going to fold, she was not going to fold, she was not—
     <em>
      fuck it
     </em>
     . She stepped forward and pulled Agatha by the front of her dress and kissed her roughly. Agatha groaned into her mouth and began walking her backwards toward the table where Rio had left her things.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Just so you know,” Rio breathed. “I'm still pissed at you. This isn't over.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked against her lips. “Oh, I know. Makes it hotter. You should know that by now.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio grumbled something under her breath, and Agatha hoisted her up onto the table with a low growl. Rio immediately spread her legs just enough for Agatha to step between them before pulling her back into a kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're insane,” Rio whispered against her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
     “For you, yes.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio used the little motor skills that she had left to hoist herself up on her palms enough for Agatha to pull her slacks and panties off. She went to unbutton her shirt, but Agatha grabbed her wrists.
    </p>
    <p>
     “No. Keep that on. I think that's kinda hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio scoffed. “You and your—”
    </p>
    <p>
     “You're hot. In general.”
    </p>
    <p>
     She tapped Rio's thighs and she spread her legs even wider instinctively. Agatha kissed her roughly to keep her as quiet as possible and pushed two fingers down to the last knuckle, immediately crooking them into Rio's favorite spot. Rio shrieked into her mouth and Agatha smirked.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Coward,” Rio groaned against her lips. “I thought you weren't—fuck. Shit. Scared of your husband anymore.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I'm not,” she lied. “But… not sure how I feel about him hearing your pretty moans. I think those are for me only, aren't they?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded and she sped up her thrusts. Rio moaned loudly into her mouth and fisted her hair tightly, and Agatha rewarded her by pressing her thumb to her clit.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Say what you are,” Agatha panted.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Yours.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I wish you hadn't forgotten that.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio nodded again and Agatha replaced her thumb with her palm, sending Rio over the edge with a loud moan that she hoped she had been able to muffle enough. She fucked Rio through the rest of her orgasm and withdrew her fingers slowly when Rio swatted at her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Agatha?”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha kissed her neck. “Mm?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I didn't let her fuck me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha frowned. “Who?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “The girl at the bar. I just wanted to make you jealous. But I'm yours. Can't see myself with anyone else.”
    </p>
    <p>
     “I know,” she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, damn it. Was she that predictable?
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow. “But… I think the least you can do is apologize properly. For lying to me.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio kissed her and giggled. “Wanted to make you jealous. Glad it worked.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Agatha smirked. “Be a good girl for once and get on your knees.”
    </p>
    <p>
     If there was any record for switching, they probably broke it throughout the next few hours.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio was fixing her hair in the mirror and getting ready to leave when Agatha stepped behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
     “Stay over for lunch,” Agatha said.
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio raised an eyebrow. “You want me to have lunch with your husband?”
    </p>
    <p>
     “With me, technically,” she said with a shrug. “I like having you around for lunch. And it will hopefully make Ralph not tell me about the football game or about his trip with Jeff.”
    </p>
    <p>
     Rio, for whatever reason, had a terrible feeling about this. She still nodded. Surely it was just a weird feeling.
