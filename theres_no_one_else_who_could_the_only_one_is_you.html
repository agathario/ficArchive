     don't be afraid to hold it close
    </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div>
<p>
     The constant buzzing of the cell phone on the bedside table woke her up and April extended an arm lazily to grab it, her still half asleep mind only registering the name ‘Leslie’ on the screen before accepting the call.
    </p>
<p>
     “Good morning, beautiful!” The blonde's enthusiastic voice rang in her ear, causing the girl to groan  ‘Good morning’ back.
    </p>
<p>
     “Look, I know this is short notice, but Ben and I decided to do a fundraiser event instead of asking for wedding gifts….”
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, yeah, Ben and Leslie were happily engaged. April had received their gifts list shortly after he had returned to Pawnee. She planned to give them a paper shredder or an heavy ornament that could serve as a murder weapon instead of the dumb things they had asked for like towels, dinnerware set or a personalized cheese board. April wouldn't normally remember what they had asked for, she did because when she read it,she was making fun of it while laying back down between Jen Barkley’s legs in her bed, face still flushed and hair sticking on the sweat of her neck while the older woman held her.
    </p>
<p>
     She opened her eyes back to reality trying to assimilate what Leslie was asking from her. “So, can you make it?”
    </p>
<p>
     For what she understood, Leslie Knope was being against the little joy the citizens of Pawnee had and trying to beat her opponent of building a fast-food in Lot 48, proposing a park - what a surprise - instead. Except the funding for her campaign was short of money and she would hold a gala at the end of the day to raise what needed.
    </p>
<p>
     Sounded boring.
    </p>
<p>
     “Uh, i don't know, i got a lot of stuff to do around here.” And it wasn't a lie. The campaign for Florida’s governor had started just two months ago and she was still getting used to living under the state's horrific sun and the grander scale of an incredibly wealthy campaign along with the work it demanded.
    </p>
<p>
     “Please? I haven't seen you since Chirstimas.”
    </p>
<p>
     April sighed. “Ok, I'll see what i can do.”
    </p>
<p>
     She checked the time - 6:40 a.m - and jumped out of the bed of her luxurious rented apartment - seriously, the money this man was spending was no joke - , getting ready for the work day and to prepare her return to Pawnee.
    </p>
<p>
     The last time she had been there was for the previous holidays as her mom’s strong latino family values wouldn't permit her to spend those days away. April would love to say it was torture to be back at home in such a joyous atmosphere and hearing her tías dissaproval of her divorce, but it wasn't. She had missed the parks staff, even if she would never admit it, seeing Andy wasn't so bad, and Jen texted her all the time until her return, complaining about how her mother kept drunkenly singing butchered renditions of Eartha Kitty’s Santa Baby.
    </p>
<p>
     And, on top of it all, they even exchanged gifts. Of course Jen wouldn't make things simple for her, demanding April to decide on a gift by herself. She got so nervous at first to pick the perfect gift but Jen was a routine woman and fell in love with the perfume April settled on gifting to her, a different scent from her's but with azaleas and green wood being the central notes too. Jen gave her an expensive bracelet made from real black onyx and silver, April thought about it like a dog collar showing who she belonged to and it never left her wrist since that day.
    </p>
<p>
     And God, the sex when they saw each other again was
     <em>
      amazing.
     </em>
     Jen hadn't even let her talk properly before they kissed and when she noticed the older woman was already on top choking her as they scissored, and April swore that in that moment her body ascended fully to an unknown dimension.
    </p>
<p>
     Because of that she was really torn in between asking Jennifer to follow along with her to Indiana or torture her a bit with distance as a foreplay to reunion.
    </p>
<p>
     Something in her body betrayed her and made her feel a painful sting at the thought of being away from Jen in a different state, so April settled for the first option.
    </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      hey
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      leslie went crazy again and is putting on a gala fundraiser today at 6 p.m
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      wanna come?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Oh, God.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      In Pawnee??
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      i’m afraid so
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      i was thinking about wearing that black dress i have with an opening in the back…
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      I’ll find a flight at 2 p.m tops.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Don’t be late.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     She laughed stupidly at that and began to pack, putting the promised dress inside the suitcase before anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen didn't play about punctuality, at ten in the morning April already had the time and place for their departure along with a digital version of her ticket. The older woman said she would pass by her apartment at one to pick her up, so April finished packing, swallowed down an early lunch and sat on her sofa anxiously trying to pretend she wasnt counting the minutes to see Jen again.
    </p>
<p>
     It was weird to think how much she gained since her hopeless crush on Jen began. Being four months into it she didn’t know exactly what they were or what she felt, too scared of sounding childish and immature to use “falling in love’’ or “girlfriend’. Even if she had the courage to, April didn’t know if the other woman felt the same. But she knew it felt good, to have someone again in her life like that after spending so much time thinking no one would be able to put up with her eccentric personality or even more difficult, find someone whose personality she would put up with.
    </p>
<p>
     There weren't many things she liked, but she sure likes Jen
     <em>
      so much
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     When the taxi parked in front of her gate  she got in quickly to escape Florida's cold winter and Jen greeted her looking like a modern Audrey Hepburn with a fur coat and cream gloves, she said ‘Hi’ and glued her lips to April's right in front of the driver.
    </p>
<p>
     Having Jen in her life was refreshing, someone who just like her wasn't afraid of saying and doing what she wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     “Explain to me again what Leslie is doing?” Jennifer asked her, sneaking an arm on her waist to pull her closer and press their bodies together, filling April with warmth enough to survive until springtime.
    </p>
<p>
     She told Jen what she understood from the phone call with a hand resting on the woman's knee, watching amused how Jen looked so beautiful laughing at Leslie's decision, her eyes getting smaller as her pink cheeks went up.
    </p>
<p>
     The flight was peaceful and when April started to drift into sleep she hooked her arm on Jen's and rested her head on the woman's shoulder, feeling a long kiss on top of her head before blacking out completely.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer nudged her back into consciousness gently, whispering in her ear. “Come on, we’re back to the old house.”
    </p>
<p>
     April smiled into her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     They got a joint room in the only hotel Jen tolerated in Pawnee, completely ignoring how the hotel clerk handed the keys looking at them as if they were from Mars. April texted Leslie about their arrival and waited in the bed as Jen took a long shower to prepare for the “Pawnee air”.
    </p>
<p>
     “Wait, come again, what did you say you used to have?” She asked, getting out of the bathroom drying her chestnut hair with a towel leaving a trail of steam behind air. Jen was wearing striped silk pajama pants with a fuzzy sweater and April thought she looked
     <em>
      hot.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She laughed at Jen's question, remembering their conversation on the car.
    </p>
<p>
     “That's what you heard. I used to have two gay boyfriends.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen laughed incredulously again, putting the towel in the back of the room’s chair and sitting on the edge of the bed. “How did that work?”
    </p>
<p>
     April stifled her smile by pursing her lips, remembering the explanation she used to give everyone who was brave enough to ask. “Derek was gay, but he was straight for me, and he was gay for Ben, and Ben was really gay for Derek. And I hated Ben.” Jen raised her eyebrows. “It was all the rage back then, they were obsessed with Leslie since she married those gay penguins.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jen bit her lip playfully at her, suddenly pulling herself up on the bed and crawling on top of April until they were face to face. She was unpredictable like that and April was becoming a fan of surprises.
    </p>
<p>
     She held Jen's face as the woman lowered her head to kiss her slowly, supporting her weight on the bed with one arm on each side of April's head and one leg between the younger’s. April traveled one hand to her back as she felt Jen's tongue on her mouth, sneaking inside her sweater and being given a surprised sigh by the clash of her cold hand on warm skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer separated from her mouth and stared deeply in April's eyes already darkening in desire. “Now you have a bisexual girlfriend who is
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     gay for you.” She punctuated her phrase with a peck on April's lips. “How do you feel about that?”
    </p>
<p>
     April was so surprised that she almost choked on her own saliva, frantically trying to find any trace of humor in Jen's eyes as she couldn't believe it. But she should have expected since Jen had always been the straightforward one in their relationship, if she could even call it that.
    </p>
<p>
     “Girlfriend?” April asked breathlessly.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen smiled down at her, the wet strands of her hair tickling the girl's face. “April, I wouldn't come to Pawnee on free will for anyone.” She then proceeded to sigh dramatically and roll to April's side on the bed, half sat resting on her elbows. “Unless, of course, you decide you prefer all of this to be casual…”
    </p>
<p>
     April instantly straddled her lap and hugged her by the shoulders into a deep kiss, falling willingly on Jennifer's manipulation, grateful for not needing to start the “What are we” conversation and for finding the only person who seemed able to read her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     At first, for such a self assured woman,it had been incredibly hard for Jennifer Barkley admitting to herself that she wanted way more than a casual fling with April. The chase had been thrilling and its consummation gratifying, but she didn't want to stop there. She felt good around April, she had a mind that matched her own and Jennifer never needed to measure words in their conversations.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen always considered ridiculous how couples felt the need to tell eachother everything and give satisfactions but as the days with April turned into weeks she kept noticing that it wasn't a need, but a want. She wanted to tell the girl about her day because she knew April would say something funny, smart or witty.
    </p>
<p>
     Since that day in Florida's hotel she knew that April hadn't seen anyone else and Jen hadn't either. Things started to get serious when she noticed that she didn't
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to see anyone else. She felt completely captured in April's atmosphere, her mouth created a maddening addiction in the girl’s mouth and her hands felt empty without the curve of her slim waist between them.
    </p>
<p>
     There was nothing for her to do except take a risk and leapt into it even though she was terrified and hadn't been anyone's girlfriend since she was a hormone controlled monster in high school.
    </p>
<p>
     Plus, it was painfully obvious to her that April wanted to take that next step. This time, she opted for not torturing her for too long.
    </p>
<p>
     Not when April made her feel good in every way possible, when she worked so fiercely in the campaign, when she picked the worst movies for them to watch together and simultaneously the best food for them to try, when they cuddled on the couch or defied the laws of gravity in bed. Seriously, it was like
     <em>
      nothing
     </em>
     Jennifer had on her repertoire. Every time it seemed they were doing something new and teaching each other. If nature could be bended, Jen was certain that one of them would be pregnant by now.
    </p>
<p>
     April was the first to detangle from the sheets and get up from the bed to start getting ready for the event, Jen flipped the channels on the humble TV with messy hair after their half an hour long make out session - over the clothes and above waist line, they couldn't afford being late and quickies practically didn't exist in their vocabulary, the two of them always got too lost in the feelling.
    </p>
<p>
     She locked herself in the bathroom to take a shower and began smiling uncontrollably, she had a
     <em>
      girlfriend.
     </em>
     And, damn, her girlfriend was Jennifer Barkley.
    </p>
<p>
     April was never one to take long when getting ready, so in no time she was already back in the room with the famous black dress, black thighs to protect her from the cold and low heels shoes. She snickered in a low voice upon noticing that Jen fell into a nap, sometimes she forgot her
     <em>
      girlfriend
     </em>
     was older. The girl kneeled with one leg on the bed and calmly shook her by the arm calling for her to wake up. She opened her eyes slowly, smiling at her. ‘’Did i leave the oven on or that’s just you, hot stuff?’’
    </p>
<p>
     She kissed Jen’s lips. ‘’Stupid.’’ April smirked, patting her on the butt. ‘’Come on, we have to leave soon.’’
    </p>
<p>
     Thirty minutes later they were locking the room and going down the elevator hand in hand to said fundraiser, April had thrown a black overcoat and Jen looked like a million bucks with a set of navy blue low-cut jumpsuit and blazer. At the taxi drive to the venue, Jen leaned in to whisper in her ear. ‘’I normally wouldn’t care but I know it’s important to you. Do you wanna tell them about us?’’
    </p>
<p>
     April thought about it for a moment squeezing Jen’s hand. “No.” Jen nodded at her. “At least not tonight, I know they will make a big deal out of it and I feel like today is important for Leslie.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Ok, whatever you say, beautiful.”
    </p>
<p>
     The venue was a long line of tents side by side and before they could enter, Jennifer pressed her against a tree to bring their lips together in a kiss that left April gasping for air. “I couldn't make it through the night if i didn't do this.” She said and walked away adjusting her clothes, leaving April smiling dumbly at the sky.  Her cheeks were starting to hurt with how much she had been smiling on the last day. That never happened.
    </p>
<p>
     She followed on Jennifer's tail and they stepped in practically together, it would be too much of a tell if they were too close but also if they were too far.
    </p>
<p>
     “April!” Leslie Knope shrieked from the other side from the other side of the room, walking towards her with her arms open to pull her into a hug. “You made it! I’m so happy!” She shook April side to side before noticing the woman next to her. “Oh, and Jen! What do I owe the pleasure?”
    </p>
<p>
     “Well, April here told me you were making dumb political decisions again and I decided to witness. It's like a car wreck,I can't look away.”
    </p>
<p>
     She was such a bitch. April's mouth was dry with desire.
    </p>
<p>
     “You won’t
     <em>
      believe
     </em>
     in what happened today.” The blonde said and pulled Jen by the arm to tell her all about how the event almost didn't happen because the opponent tried to sabotage it, not before the campaign manager shot a look asking for help to April, who just shrugged.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked around the room and made her way around her old coworkers, greeting Tom, Jerry and Donna at a table and making small talk about how life had been lately for them. At some point, she even said “Hi” to Ann who tried hugging her unsuccessfully and told April how she was looking for a sperm donor.
    </p>
<p>
     April purposely avoided Chris, she knew it was stupid but the pang of jealousy was there when she thought about seeing his stupid smiley face and remembering that he already was lucky enough in his lifetime to get with Jen. Bastard.
    </p>
<p>
     At the wine station she was intercepted by Ben, whom she allowed one single hug and asked her about Florida, wanting to make sure that April was happy working there. She tried her best to tell him how much she was enjoying it without mentioning her relationship with the hot bombshell that used to be his boss, settling on talking about all the frozen iguanas she saw there.
    </p>
<p>
     When he left to look for Leslie, Andy caught up to her.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi April.” He greeted awkwardly with a single wave as he sat next to her. It had been sometime since the divorce, but the first interactions were always like this.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hi, Andy.” Her sympathetic voice came out, he was still a nice friend. “How have you been?”
    </p>
<p>
     “I’m good, i’m good.” Andy muttered and looked across the room trying to find some topic. “Oh, I did my police academy exam today.”
    </p>
<p>
     “Really? Andy, that's huge. How was it?
    </p>
<p>
     He was really confident that he had passed the exam and April was happy for him, she really wished him well. At some point he grabbed one of her wrists to demonstrate.
    </p>
<p>
     “Official police wrist lock.You can't hit me. Try to hit me.” He was holding just one of them, so she gave him a weak slap on his head with the other. “Or here, no, try,it's this hand.Wrist lock. Boom, too much pain,you can't even hit me.Try to hit me.”
    </p>
<p>
     He held her other wrist but let the other go, so April repeated the slap in the other side of his hand. “If I had my gun, you wouldn't try to hit me, though, is the thing.” Andy said embarrassed, making April laugh loudly.
    </p>
<p>
     He spotted the police chief present and left her to go after him. April looked around the room to find out where to go next and her eyes fell upon Jennifer at the table with Leslie and Ben, shooting daggers at April with her eyes and knuckles white around the champagne glass, making it very clear that she witnessed the whole of her interaction with her ex-husband.
    </p>
<p>
     She got down from the stall to go in her direction, but Jennifer chugged the rest of her drink in one big gulp and excused herself, threading into the crowd of Pawnee citizens.
    </p>
<p>
     The talk with Leslie hadn't been bad as she imagined it would. Her opponent was a complete idiot and even dumber, but Leslie was doing the best she could in such a short deadline, even if it was in a completely different direction than Jen would have recommended.
    </p>
<p>
     Regarding the event, even Jennifer Barkley had the heart to admit it was nicely put together for something planned in less than 24 hours.
    </p>
<p>
     Ben and Leslie were more sappy than usual after being engaged but she didn't have the heart to complain, not when being away from April was starting to make her feel physical pain. Speaking of, Jen scanned the room around to look for her girlfriend - it was still unusual to think of this word, but it wasn't bad -, and her heart dropped at the sight of her with Andy, laughing while he held her wrist, probably doing something stupid.
    </p>
<p>
     Unironically, Jennifer felt like throwing up. Her stomach turned and she was incredulous with the fact that she was
     <em>
      jealous
     </em>
<em>
      .
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     April's eyes found her's and Jen ran away not ready to have this conversation right now, infiltrating in the haze of cheap perfume and boring conversation of Pawniees until she managed to get out of the tent and breathe some fresh hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer reclined on one of the beams holding the place together,putting a hand on her hummering chest and widening her eyes when an awful thought passed her mind; “
     <em>
      What if she likes him more than me?”
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     What.the.fuck.
    </p>
<p>
     She was Jennifer Barkley! What godforsaken
     <em>
      Andy Dawyer
     </em>
     had to up her?
    </p>
<p>
     Except the fact that he and April had spent years together and would probably form a family at some point if still together.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to compose herself and looked around the improvised food court outside. God, what type of event only had trailers of foreign food as options for appetizers? Pawnee really was where hope went to die.
    </p>
<p>
     Jen settled on the one that seemed less worse with chicken tenders and fries. She waited impatiently until her order was ready and looked down in disgust when they didn't even have the decency to give her a cheap plastic fork, picking the food with just her fingertips and giving a small bite.
    </p>
<p>
     “Jen Barkley!” She heard a shrill voice on her back, as if things couldn't get worse.
    </p>
<p>
     “
     <em>
      Oh, god.”
     </em>
     Jen mumbled under her breath and turned around to face Chris Traeger. “Hi.”
    </p>
<p>
     “How long has it been?” He gave her an annoying smile and Jen was in disbelief that she used to sleep with people whose personalities were so far from her own. What had April done to her? “I haven't seen you in so long. You know, I was expecting us to say goodbye the last time you were here.”
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      “That's because I made a pointed effort to not see you.
     </em>
     ” She thought but a small voice in her head reminded her that these people mattered to April and she could at least attempt to be nice.  “Yeah, such a shame, I didn't find you.”
    </p>
<p>
     He stared at her dumbly with his hands on his pockets and Jennifer would literally throw up in his shoes if he said anything suggestive.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly Leslie's voice echoed in a speech introduction and Jen actually sighed in relief, saved by the bell. She turned around in her ankles and stepped back into the tent, eyeing April alone in one of the tables and marching there, leaving her almost untouched food in the table with a low
     <em>
      “Hi”.
     </em>
     Jen furrowed her brows when April didn't even look in her direction.
    </p>
<p>
     “I am so happy to announce that as of one minute ago,we have reached our fund-raising goal.” Leslie Knope said and the place erupted in applause, Jen was actually very impressed. “Every dollar spent here tonight by you, the community, will be poured right back into this wonderful project. And speaking of community, I'd like to thank my community,my friends.” She held her glass to each table that had a Parks’ staff in it, even to April and Jen. “It's a lesson that I have learned over and over again,but it bears repeating; No one achieves anything alone.”
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer always had been skeptical of this type of philosophy but she kept being proven wrong when things ran much more smoothly in her job and life since April entered it.
    </p>
<p>
     “Without further ado,the best band in Pawnee;Mouse Rat.” Leslie announced and got down the stage.
    </p>
<p>
     Jennifer groaned when the first notes of the song started, leaning to whisper in April's ear. “God, imagine what the worst is.” She chuckled but April kept her face shut, even if Jen could see the slight pull of a smile on the outer corner of her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     April lowered her eyes and crossed her arms, demonstrating clearly how uncomfortable she was and the puzzle pieces connected with ease in Jen's mind. The girl probably left to look for her and saw her talking to Chris Traeger as if he meant anything for Jen.
    </p>
<p>
     Well, Jen understood. April was still considerably younger and Jennifer had been shown tonight that even herself wasn't immune to insecurity and envy.
    </p>
<p>
     “Hey.” She got closer, placing a hand on April’s arm in a considerable distance that said ‘Mentoring her friend’ instead of ‘Trying to show my girlfriend how much I care about only her’ to anyone on the outside. “Do you wanna talk about it?”
    </p>
<p>
     April gaped her mouth at her with glistening eyes, cursing herself to be demonstrating so much vulnerability in a public space, finding Jen looking at her knowingly and with
     <em>
      empathy
     </em>
     .
    </p>
<p>
     Love really changes people, doesn't it?
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could say anything, Ben Wyatt stopped at their table in such a hurry that almost knocked to the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     “Leslie and I are getting married.” He said out of breath.
    </p>
<p>
     “Yeah, we know.” April said with her usual apathy. “That's all you talk about.”
    </p>
<p>
     “No, we are getting married
     <em>
      today.
     </em>
     ”
    </p>
<p>
     She looked at Jen, who had an expression just as surprised as hers before they simultaneously looked at Ben to exclaim together. “
     <em>
      What!?”
     </em>

      The ride on Donna’s car to Ann's house was one of the most insane events Jennifer Barkley ever lived through. She was squeezed in the back seat between April, who kept quiet all the way, Tom who talked very loudly about how wanted to give a big speech on the wedding, Andy in the passenger seat humoring him while Donna planned what song she would sing. Was Jen the only person that saw the complete madness in all of this?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They arrived at the house in a record time almost together with the rest of the parks’ staff. Leslie was already there, her and Ben making a stupid pact of not looking at each other until the ceremony and standing back to back.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen took a place in the back, arms crossed and against the fireplace expecting to pass by unnoticed on the preparations. She wasn't really part of that crew, right? No way in
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       hell
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      they would convince her to partake.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, let's go over the duties right now.” Leslie started.  “Ann, you're in charge of the dress and the hair and the makeup. And I was thinking, like, the sensuality
     </span>
<span>
      of Eleanor Roosevelt combined with the animal magnetism of Lesley Stahl.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Piece of cake.” Ann replied like the calmest woman in the world. “Oh, we have to get the wedding cake. I'll do that too.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Also, we need rings and marriage licenses.” Ben added.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, let me be on rings.I love what they symbolize.” Chris stepped in, April and Jen rolled their eyes subtly without even knowing that they were doing the same thing.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And I can do the license.” Andy exclaimed. “I got a guy that works at City Hall.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April turned to him with her brows furrowed “ Uh,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       you
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      work at City Hall.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, yeah. The guy is me.” He smiled at April and Jen ran through her head how many bad scenarios would develop if she punched him in the face right now.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The soon to be wedded gave off the remaining tasks and suddenly Jen realized that everyone was turned in her direction as she analized her own nails, not paying much attention. “What?” Ben raised her eyebrows at her in a silent question. “Oh!” Jen laughed. “You expect
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       me
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      to get something done?” She asked, pointing at herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Yes
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .” Ben exclaimed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Sorry to say, Jen.” Leslie's teasing tone came from behind him. “You're part of this.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, God.” Jen groaned, choosing the least horrible option and dragging her feet to Ann's living room table, sitting next to her on the head of it, April's stare almost burning a hole on the fine fabric of her jumpsuit. “Fine, I will do…whatever you're doing.” Leslie seemed content enough when she grabbed a fashion magazine from the table and opened it. No woman deserved to look bad on her wedding day.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay then.” Ben said, rubbing his hands togethers anxiously. “I will set off after the rings with Chris. Andy and April, be careful at the City Hall.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “What!?” The word was out of Jennifer's mouth while she still processed the information that they would be going
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       together
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      . She just assumed April would mop around the house or follow Leslie around.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The whole crew now stared at her and she avoided April's eyes like the plague. “I just…” She lifted the magazine with one hand, coming up with a fast excuse. “They’re saying rosé wedding dresses are in this year. Crazy, right?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wow, Jen, I appreciate your enthusiasm.” Leslie said earnestly. “Honestly, I was expecting you to say at least ten things that could go wrong.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jennifer shrugged. “Maybe I've grown a soft spot.” Her eyes immediately followed to April, catching a glimpse of vulnerability in the girl's eyes.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wow, I guess the Florida sun really is different.” Leslie laughed. “By the way, how is Florida? Are you and April getting alon-”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I think…” Ben stepped in. “That we can all talk about this later.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Saved by the bell.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, okay, yes.” The blonde continued. “Let's say that we're all gonna meet back here in an hour. I love all of you. One, two, three, break!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They all left in a hurry through the door, leaving Jen alone with Ann, Leslie and her own thoughts of what Andy and April would be doing by now. Probably realizing that they are the true love of each other's life and deciding to give it another shot.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The three women gathered around the mannequin supporting Leslie's unfinished wedding dress, looking at it and trying to think of some plausible solution.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why didn't the seamstress finish it?” Leslie asked rhetorically.  “If you're not gonna finish something three months early,then don't accept the job.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Leslie, you just read my mind.” Jennifer said, gathering the unfinished skirt on her hands.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Ann sighed. “There's got to be something we can do.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “This wedding is meant to be.We're gonna figure it out.” Leslie said and Jen chuckled skeptically. “What is it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you really believe that?” Jen asked her. “The whole meant to be stuff?”.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes.” She replied with not even an ounce of doubt. “Ben and I found each other and I just can't think about spending one more day without him being my husband. The time is now.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How do you know?” Jennifer hated how vulnerable her voice sounded. A part of her yearning for something she couldn't name.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Leslie tilted her head at her with something different in her eyes. “When you know, you know.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her and Ann began a ramble about Cinderella and how she finished her dress, both their voices far away as Jen's mind could only think about April.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, we got it!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We got it.” April and Andy’s voices echoed in the room as they stumbled in, making Jen's heart hitch by seeing her again.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Marriage license,done!” He handed it to Leslie, who analyzed the papers.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why are there so many?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I took all of them.” April said. “I don't want anyone else in this town to get married, because it makes it less special for you and Ben.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen suppressed a smile at that. April was so weird! She had missed her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wait a minute, hold on.” Leslie said. “It needs to be signed by somebody at the City Clerk's Office.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I'll just forge it.” April shrugged “I forge government documents all the time.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “That’s true” Jen chimed in even though she knew it was a lie, because she didn't let April do it.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Leslie looked between them “No!” She handed the documents back to April when her phone started to ring, excusing herself to accept the call.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey.” April got closer to her, nudging Jen with her shoulder. “How are things here?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Total chaos.” Jen admitted with an ironic smile, leaning closer to whisper in her ear. “That's insane, isn't it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April stared at her sadly. “I think it's kind of romantic. I mean, I married Andy after dating him for a month.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen's blood boiled, suddenly feeling an urge to be cruel. “And that worked out very well, didn't it?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She regretted immediately, her heart dropping at the sight of April crossing her arms and stepping back, looking more vulnerable than ever. “April…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, Ann, dress duty.” Leslie yelled walking across the room. “Andy, come on we’re going to your house. April and Jen, license duty.No time for verbs.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen reached out a hand to touch April, but she just stepped away again. “Come on, let's do this for Leslie.” She picked up a pen and one of the forms, getting out the house without even sparing a second look to Jennifer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She followed April into the cold night, ignoring how Ann watched them with curiosity. “April!” Jen called quickening her pace to fall into step next to the girl, the wind punishing them. “What is happening? Are we fighting?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April just kept stepping hard in a direction unknown to Jen, who braced herself closing her blazer tighter against the screeching wind.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “April!” She pledged, holding her gently by the forearm and turning her around to face her. April's eyes were red and watering, her arms crossed to shield herself from Jen. “Talk to me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I'm not the one who needs to talk, Jennifer.” April spat out, surprising Jennifer with the outburst. “You’ve been away all night and when I try to talk to you I see you with
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Chris
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Just like she had imagined. “Chris? April, I understand where this comes from but he doesn't mean
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       anything
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      to me. At all.
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       He
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      saw me,
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       he
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      tried to talk to me. I don't care about him.” She would have left it at that, when the jealousy inside her spoke louder. “You, on the other hand, have been having a
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       great
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      time with Andy.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “He is my friend, Jennifer! We’re all putting in an effort to make this happen.” She exclaimed, hands clenched and putting her foot down like a child. “I care about him! We have a history!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Then maybe you should honor this history and get back together!” Jen snapped back, realizing how insane she sounded when April scoffed at her. “Oh my god.Oh my god.” She kept murmuring and turned around, rubbing her hands on her face to get back to reality, taking a deep breath and realizing she should do one of the hardest things ever. Apologize.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen turned around to face April again. “I'm sorry, okay? I’ve been acting insane because I'm
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       jealous.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      I’m insecure, which is
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       not
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      a normal feeling for me, and I have the most irrational fear that you will leave me and go back to him.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April nodded slowly at her, taking in all of the information. “What you said was mean.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I know.” Jen said , knowing it was regarding her divorce. “And I'm sorry. I guess I just wanted to prove to you that you shouldn't get back with him.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The girl got closer to her. “Firstly, you being mean to me is a number one turn on, but i really didn't appreciate this time.” She said, grabbing at Jen's blazer hem and pulling her closer. “Second, I don't need you to prove that to me, okay? I made my decision a
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       long
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      time ago and Andy, from now to forever, matters to me as only a friend.” April laced her arms around Jen's neck, the woman promptly held her by the waist when their foreheads met. “Third, you have absolutely nothing to worry about. I’m obsessed with you and the only way i'm leaving is if you send me away. And even then, I would sleep underneath your bed and follow you around so closely that I would turn into your shadow.’’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen burst into a laugh, covering her mouth with one hand when she snorted, making April laugh too. “How can you make this sound so adorable.’’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, i wasn’t kidding’’ April widened her eyes at Jen and shook her head. “It’s a
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       very
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      serious thre- Hum.’’ Her words got lost when Jen held her tightly and brought their lips together in a slow and tender kiss that spread warmth along their bodies even when cold drops started to fall on top of their shoulders.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’It’s snowing.’’ Jen pointed when their mouths separated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April gave her a peck on the lips, pulling her by the hand to continue walking underneath the falling snow until they reached a cream house at the end of two or three blocks. Jennifer couldn’t help but notice how small Pawnee was. They knocked on the door of the closest City Hall’s clerk.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’Miss Beavers, this is official government business.’’ April said when an old lady opened the door.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’I hope we didn't wake you up.’’ Jennifer said from behind, trying to snuggle closer to April to run from the cold.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’It's after 10:00.” The woman said. ‘’I've been asleep for four hours. What do you want?’’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We need you to sign this.” April told her ,handing over a pen while Jen gave Ethel Beavers her best politician smile. “It's a marriage license.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ethel? Is it robbers?” An old man appeared confused behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No, go back to bed.”
     </span>
<span>
      She yelled back at him.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is that your husband?’’ April asked.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I'm not married. I was on a date tonight. It went well,he's sleeping over.’’ The lady answered carefree, reading the document.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’Cool.’’ April said, genuine.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wow, good for her.’’ Jen murmured behind her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’It's for Leslie Knope and Ben Wyatt.” April told her. ‘’I think you know them?’’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’They dragged me out in the freezing cold once, so they could tell each other ‘I love you’." She said signing the paper and handing it back to April. ‘’It was annoying.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’Thank you so much!’’ Jen said, almost jumping into place to warm up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’You have got an amazing house and a really cool nightgown.’’ April told her, unfazed by the weather.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’And seems to be super good at dating.” Jennifer added. “I admire that.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yeah, so can we adopt you as our grandma?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Fine.” Ethel shrugged and Jen laughed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “We love you, Grandma!” April exclaimed while the door slammed on their face, hooking her arm on Jen so they could walk back to Ann’s house, their footsteps marking the ground.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The door shrieked open again and the woman shouted for April, making them turn around together. “Good for you!’’ She exclaimed with a thumbs up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen looked at April surprised, but she only laughed. “Can’t believe she was the first one to figure it out.’’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      *
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April took the marriage license and Jen directly back to Ann's living room, receiving a text from Ron to let her know that everything was ready for the ceremony.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How are you not cold?” Jen asked when they entered the house, resisting the urge to hug April to warm her up.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It's because my heart is black and doesn't pump hot blood, so there isn't much of a difference.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen cackled suddenly with that, covering her mouth and looking around the room to see if Ann or Leslie had heard her. April felt so proud everytime she managed to make her laugh like that.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She was feeling so much better now that they had talked, a weight lifted off her back in knowing that her feelings were valid and being able to figure out what was upsetting Jen. April knew it wasn't exactly nice to see her with Andy, but she didn't understand the extent of that feeling in Jen until their conversation.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Her guard was a bit more down but still alert to the staff's presence. It was Leslie and Ben's wedding, it was the worst time possible to breach her relationship with the woman.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
</span>
<span>
      “All set.” Jen announced when they walked in the room, seeing Leslie with a merge of her original’s dress bust with a skirt made of paper. It pained April to admit, but Ann had done a good job.“Leslie, wow!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      "You look amazing.” April complemented, suddenly filled with emotion.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Right? Who could’ve known, you clean up nice.” Jen teased, making Leslie roll her eyes playfully. “It 's beautiful.” She admitted, at last.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Okay, so we're ready out there.” April said, trying to keep up her usual attitude. “For your wedding or whatever.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Oh, my God,the license, the rings,the officiant, everything?” Leslie asked, unbelieving.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, it all came together.” The girl confirmed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Leslie took a deep excited breath. “Let 's go!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      At the venue while everyone took their places and Ron waited outside with Leslie, April sat at the first row between Ann and Jen, not standing being away from her anymore.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why are all those people here? I thought the event had already ended.” Jen whispered to her.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April knew the answer would send Jennifer into a frenzy. “They are all guests.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Jesus Christ.” Jen groaned. “Half of Pawnee is here!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The girl smiled at her, discreetly touching her hand with the point of her fingers. “I wouldn't say half, more like eighty-percent.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, you’re one of them, so it's not so bad.” April was surprised with Jen's sudden words, the woman stared at her with a half smile and April was glad that the wedding march started to play, because she didn't know what to say.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Leslie looked radiant walking down the aisle, until a guy started shouting in the back. “Boo, boo.Boo, Leslie Knope, boo.” They turned around to see that it was Councilman Jamm, still being a very sore loser because Leslie's project won over his’. “Here comes the boo,all dressed in boo. Boo, Leslie Knope, boo-oo-oo-oo”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Is this the idiot that was trying to stall a burger joint with a child sized soda in it?” Jennifer asked in April's ears and the girl nodded her head as they watched the argument between bride, groom, Ron and the idiot get heated.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Until Jamm throwed two stinky bombs from Amazon in the carpet and Ron was forced to punch him in the face, which entertained April a lot but earned them a trip to the closest police precinct, ending the ceremony they had worked so hard on right there.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Andy claimed he was a future police man and took Leslie to try and bail Ron out, as the people started to go away and the rest of them stayed moping around in the venue.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No.” Ann suddenly said. “You know what, this isn't right.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Ben just kept sitting in a chair, looking at the ground very sadly. What started to make Jennifer feel pity, and she hated to feel that. So she decided to do what she did best and take command. “Okay, you know what? Let's do it.” She announced.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “How?’ Ben questioned. “They are already coming over to take everything down.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Well, they can't if there isn't anything to take.” Jen answered like it was obvious. She pointed at Andy. “You there, all muscles, no brain, gather tables and chairs enough and tie them to that truck of a car.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey!” Donna exclaimed, realizing she was talking about her's.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen raised her hands in apology. “Everyone, take all the decorations and food you can fit in your arms.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Wait, where do we take it?” Tom asked and Jen sighed.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “The place which, God knows why, Leslie Knope loves the most.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “City Hall.” Ann said with a smile. “You heard her, let's get moving.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everyone started to follow the command and Jen turned around to April, who looked at her like she was the moon. “Not you.You just sit there and look pretty.” She said in a low voice, winking at April.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When they started to organize everything in City Hall, April felt like she was walking on clouds. Seeing Jennifer there, being part of the team, made her feel like all the bits of her life were connecting to each other and a yearn to hang on Jen's arm and show her off as her girlfriend to everyone there started to crept in.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Not today
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      .” She reminded herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Hey, April.” Ann Perkins got next to her while April covered the tables in red and white fabric. “I just wanted to say, I'm really happy for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ew! Don't.” She said, even though she had no ideia why Ann said that. “I hate that something I did made you happy.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “It's not exactly something
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       you
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      did.” April hated how she could hear the smile in her voice, but her eyes followed Ann’s to land on Jen, who had crossed arms and was supervising Andy to make sure he was hanging the lights correctly.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Everything clicked in April's mind.“I have no ideia what youre talking about.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Ann nodded. “I had already assumed it was a secret. Not because she is a woman, I doubt very much that you two give a damn about that, but because it is Leslie's big day, and you wanted to do something nice.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April shrugged, not wanting to give in even if Ann was absolutely right.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “But, you know, it's kind of obvious.” Ann smiled. “Jen is never that nice and the dark cloud that is constantly above you now is more greyish than pitch black.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Don't laugh,April.”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      She thought to herself.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I wish you both very well. And I won't tell anyone.” She assured, moving on to her next task.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Ann?” The woman turned around to her. “Thank you.” She mouthed in silence and Ann replied with a smile.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was incredible what a bit of teamwork effort was capable of doing, they really managed to transform the department into an acceptable venue. The expectation filled the room as Ann went to get Leslie and Donna warmed up her voice.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April took her place next to Jen again, closer now that there were less people and finally they stood up when the double doors opened and Leslie strolled in with Ron.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Tom began the ceremony. “We are gathered here tonight to join Leslie Knope and Benjamin Wyatt in marriage. It's been a long and winding road for these two lovebirds. And they're so impatient to begin their lives together they've moved their wedding date up three months.” They laughed at that, April could feel the warmth of Jen’s knee touching her’s. “So I say, let's keep it short and sweet.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Yes, just do it already.” April teased, earning a small smile from Ben and Leslie that mirrored her own. The atmosphere felt so nice, charged with romance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I assume, and hope,you prepared your own vows?Ben,you want to say some stuff about Leslie?
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Ben breathed deeply and began. “In my time working for the state government, my job sent me to 46 cities in 11 years.
     </span>
<span>
      I lived in villages with eight people, rural farming communities,college towns.I was sent to every corner of Indiana. And then I came here.And I realized that,this whole time,I was just wandering around,
     </span>
<span>
      everywhere,just looking for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April sighed, feeling those words deeply in her core and realizing that maybe this is how she felt about Washington. Suddenly, Jen hooked her pinky finger on her’s in a small but powerful demonstration of affection.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The ceremony proceeded with Leslie considering reading the seventy page first draft of her vows, but deciding to speak from the heart instead. “The things
     </span>
<span>
      that you have done for me,to help me, support me,surprise me, to make me happy,go above and beyond what any person deserves.You're all I need.I love you and I like you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I love you and I like you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “And now, with the power vested in me
     </span>
<span>
      by the state of Indiana,I now pronounce you husband and wife.You may now kiss the–” He was interrupted when they swopped each other into a kiss. “Well, oops, okay.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>

     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Later the champagnes were handed for a toast and someone’s phone was placed on top of the robot vacuum cleaner to roam around the room with a Nicki Minaj song.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Between conversations and Leslie happy tears, April managed to steal Jen away for a few moments to her old office, suddenly wanting to show her around her old life.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Do you miss it?” Jen asked when April lounged lazily in her old chair, as she reclined on the table in front of the girl.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “No.” April shook her head. “I miss them, sometimes. Other times I feel like I outgrown it. Like I'm where I'm supposed to be.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen smiled empathetically at her and took her hand. “I'm sorry again, about earlier. I'm not used to being jealous, clearly.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April smiled, squeezing her hand. “It's ok. I'm sorry too, I just assumed that you suddenly wanted a revival with Chris and went with it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “April, I had a lot of people in my life. Like, really a lot.” Jennifer began and April groaned. “Wait, listen. I lived a life, just like you did, and I can't change my past even if I wanted to. And life is unpredictable, how could I ever imagine that the girl I passed by to enter one of Leslie's boring meetings would turn out to be the person I care the most about?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April smiled, her eyes suddenly tearing up.“Really?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>
       “Yes.
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      I spent so much time of my life believing I was unlikable and you show me that it isn't true. For me, it doesn't matter what is in my past, it matters that I want you in my future, and only you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Where is all of this coming from?” She teased, even if her voice shaked with emotion after Jen's words.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The woman scrunched her nose adorably. “I don't know, I think this wedding vibe is really speaking to me.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April took advantage of Jen's hand on her’s and pulled the woman forward, stretching her neck to give Jennifer a kiss, her warm hands holding April's face.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Aw, you guys!” They froze with the sound of Leslie's voice coming from the door.  “This is so adorable!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Both looked back slowly to face the entirety of Pawnee’s Parks and Recreation staff on the entrance staring at them. Some of curiosity, some with knowing looks - Ann and Ron, God knows how - but all of them amused with the discovery.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why didn't you say anything?” Leslie asked without judgment, walking to them and surprising both with a hug that they tried to pretend was unwanted. “I'm so happy for you!”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April tried to channel her inner unemotional self. “I knew you would fuzz all over it.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “She just wanted today to be focused on you.” Jen said almost at the same time.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Jen.”
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      April
     </span>
<span>
      scolded in a low voice, making the woman laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As April expected, they made a big deal out of it. Leslie and Ben hugged and talked to them like it was
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       their
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      wedding; next to the improvised bar Donna was short and simple to tell April that even if she didn't dig it, Jen was a beautiful woman and she was lucky; Ann intercepted Jen in the bathroom to tell her that even if April had a hard exterior, it was obvious how much she liked Jen; Ron also stopped her to say something along the lines, although with a slight undertone of threat; Jerry and Tom, well, they were Jerry and Tom. Jerry just rambled about how he had a lesbian niece whom she loved very much and Tom said to Jen that if April was with her, then she must be “cool”.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Andy was much calmer than April expected him to be, he had always known about her bisexuality and genuinely said that he wanted to see her happy again, because she was important in his life and a good friend.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When she got to steal Jennifer for a moment and get something to eat, Chris approached them in his feminist mode and discussed how powerful women were and how special it was for them to reach the peak of being in touch with the feminine side that led them to appreciate other women romantically. A bit obnoxious, but sincere and it made them laugh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As the night was already approaching an end and everyone was getting a few more drinks than normal, Jen kicked off her shoes and reclined on a chair, putting her feet on another in the front to listen to a song that Andy and Donna insisted on performing. April got a chair and sat right next to her slouched in it, hugging her just because now she could.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “I look around this room.” Andy began with the guitar in his hands. “If it weren't for Leslie Knope,none of us would be here.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen thought about how much this was true, if she hadn't been hired to go against the powerful opponent that Leslie was, she wouldn't be here right now with April in her arms.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “So, Leslie, this song,which is for Li'l Sebastian,is for you.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Up in horsey heaven,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      here's the thing
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      You trade your legs
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      for angel's wings
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      And once we've all said
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      good-bye
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      You take a running leap,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      and you learn to fly
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Bye-bye,
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Li'l Sebastian
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Miss you
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      in the saddest fashion…”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      When the song ended, Jen had never been more confused. “Sorry, what does the song say?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Leslie goggled her eyes at her. “You don't know who Lil’Sebastian is?”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Then she proceeded to explain to her about a pony who was Pawnee’s treasure and how he was also a sign that she and Ben should get married tonight. She wasn't sure if she didn't understand much because it was weird or because she was tipsy and April was almost slumped on her shoulder.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’Hey,Jen.’’ Ben called her in front of anyone. ‘’You know what this means now,right?’’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She knit her eyebrows together to him. ‘’What?’’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      He smiled mischievously ‘’You’re one of us now.’’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jennifer paralyzed in fear.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’Oh my god.’’ April lifted her head up. ‘’You totally are.’’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      The murmurs of agreement started to get louder as Jen denied with her head.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’Welcome to the Pawnee crew, Jen!’’ Leslie exclaimed and she almost screamed in terror when everyone started to cheer on it. Until April held her face from behind to kiss her on the cheek and did the impossible; convinced Jennifer Barkley that Pawnee,Indiana wasn't the worst city in the world.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      It was clear that most of the crew couldn't handle their booze, so when they started to find corners to sit or lay down, Jen decided it was time to go and take April home.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      They said their goodbyes quickly and April lingered a bit to talk to Leslie.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’Hey,i’m sorry for crashing your wedding.’’ She said apologetically.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’Are you kidding? I’m so happy right now i could cry.’’
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      ‘’Please,don’t.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Leslie smiled, taking April's hands in her's. “There were a lot of signs that Ben and I should get married tonight.But, truth be told,we just really wanted to get married.When you're in love,everything seems like a sign.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Why are you telling me all this?” April asked in a low voice, even if she suspected the answer.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      “Because I love my husband, I love my job, I love my friends. I love love. It should be celebrated, and that's what we did here tonight.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      April realized that she was referring to her and Jennifer too, her cheeks heated and her breath hitched. “I think…i think it's soon for that word.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Leslie looked at her knowingly. “But not for the feeling, right?” She smiled when April continued wordlessy staring at her. “Good night, April. I hope I get to see you soon.”
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She nodded and looked at both sides before giving Leslie a quick hug and running back to Jen, who waited for her hailing a cab at the City Hall entrance.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She strutted in her direction in the dark hallway, and, when Jennifer turned back at her and smiled with the street lights and falling snow illuminating her face, April suddenly felt that the answer to Leslie's question could be “
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Yes.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>

      They got back to the hotel and Jen sighed tiredly as she took off her balzer and shoes, lowering the lights and asking April to open the back of her jumpsuit, she shaked in anticipation as her knuckles brushed on the skin of her back as the zipper lowered, the simple contact making Jen moan softly.

      She let the jumpsuit fall at her feet revealing her bare torso and turning around to pull April's dress off her body. Jen took off her own last piece of clothing and got under the covers, watching silently aroused as April discharged the rest of her clothes. She climbed in next to Jen,it was a comfortable silence, the feel of eachother skin enhanced by how light their heads were because of the alcohol.

      April sighed when Jennifer brushed her hair to the side, nosing along her shoulder and kissing her neck. She melted against the older woman's body, giving in all the control as usual.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Jen kissed her immediately. Their mouths met hotly in a lust filled haze on the dimly lit room, Jens warm hand on April's cold face and they smiled, just because they felt like smiling. Suddenly Jennifer pulled April to her lap, sitting against the headboard and gripping the girl's waist tightly, she pulled the covers a bit more up and slid her hand down the middle of April's legs.

      April thought that the moan she let out when two fingers filled her was pathetic, but Jen, who swallowed it with her mouth, thought it was mesmerizing. Jennifer moved them slowly, her other hand caressing April’s waist and back, feeling the suave rolls of her hips meeting her thrusts halfway. The girl’s hands roamed her face and shoulders, the only sounds in the room being their heavy-breathing, the subtle squeak of the mattress, the smack of their lips and tongues meeting and low whispers of  “
     </span>

<span>
       Do you like it this way?’’
      </span>
</em>
<span>
      and ‘’
     </span>
<em>
<span>
       Yes,...please.”
      </span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      Their foreheads touched when April tipped her head forward as she approached the finishing line, overwhelmed and wanting to get even closer to Jen. She held her face with both hands and came with a deep sigh.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      As soon as she recovered, April pushed Jen to lie completely on the bed and made her way downwards under the sheets, her mouth trailing hot kisses that covered Jen's breasts briefly before she carried on and put her mouth to use along with two fingers, used to the other woman's body and how she felt pleasure the most. Jennifer got lost in the feeling, throwing her head back with an open mouth that couldn't stop jarring curse words and moans as the girl moved her tongue in circles on her sensitive spot while her fingers worked sloppy and dirty in a come hither motion. April's other hand rested on her stomach and Jen took it, intertwining their fingers together as she pressed her ankle on April's back and orgasmed with a loud whimper.
     </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
      She pulled April back up and kissed her hard. Usually, this would be just the beginning, but the emotions and motions of the day started to weigh in and both were satisfied in just holding each other under the covers and looking in each other's eyes, finding words that their mouths weren't brave enough to say yet.
