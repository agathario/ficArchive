<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Mom! It looks fine, really."</p><p>Rio Vidal's gaze lifted to take in her son, holding his hand out expectantly for the jersey she had just finished ironing, his lips twisting in an annoyed fashion.</p><p>"It's photo day, I just wanted to make sure it looked good!" she insisted, though a sweet smile wound its way up her lips, her eyes soft as she took in the sight of her son as he slid the soccer jersey over his head. There had been days, when Nicky was younger, that Rio was afraid he might not make it this far in life. He had already faced so much, taken so much struggle head on in his life that she wanted nothing but happiness and peace for him.</p><p>------------</p><p>The first time Nicky had gotten sick, he had been three. What had started as a cold had rapidly progressed into something worse. Leukemia. There had been many sleepless nights spent in hospitals, many days in chemo treatments spent making paper stars and origami cranes. What had been hardest for Rio? Watching Agatha show up day after day for their son, despite the fact that she could see the light fading out of the other woman. It had worn her down after the first eight months, and had kept her underwater for the following six, until the day they got word that he was in remission. He hadn't quite understood it, hadn't really grasped that this worst of it was over, for the time being, but Rio and Agatha had.</p><p>The night after finding out, they had let him eat as much ice cream as he could have managed, falling asleep across their laps. Though Agatha had been the one to carry him up the stairs, they had both tucked him in with a kiss on the forehead. They had departed to their room where they no longer had to keep face and all but dissolved into one another, a flurry of tears and sniffles surrounding them. It was over, for now, and he was going to be okay.</p><p>That was never intended to be infinite, was it?</p><p>Rio had built a name for herself because of her ability to create, her ability to detail worlds and feelings and relationships from the pits of her imagination. The people who bought her books? Well, her work was highly praised, and the convenience of getting to spend most of her time working from home? It gave her a comfort to have most of her time available for her son. That had never been more true as it was the day after his twelfth birthday. He hadn't been feeling well the night of his birthday, and so when he hadn't gotten up at his usual hour the next day, she had decided to let him sleep. Agatha had already left for work at the precinct by the time the sun was up, and Rio just lazed around for a bit, nursing a coffee as she tidied up the house. When eleven rolled around, though, she thought it was probably best to just make sure Nicky was alright. She had tapped on his door, then knocked a little harder. At the lack of response, she opened the door to find him splayed out on the ground, his skin pale and his chest moving in shallow, slow breaths. She was on the phone within an instant, calling 911 first, and then Agatha second.</p><p>Getting that news a second time, it wasn't just hard anymore. It was crippling. How much of their son's life were they going to have to spend watching him fight for it? It was heartbreaking as parents because there was nothing that could be done, no power that existed that could keep him healthy and happy, it seemed.</p><p>The following year was another round of hospital trips, overnight stays, endless sickness that felt like it was just a cycle. The night that Agatha had come into the bedroom at 1AM in tears, Rio had not been braced for what Agatha had to say.</p><p>"He asked that we let him go. That we stop making him fight," Agatha had disclosed.</p><p>"No," Rio answered immediately without hesitation. "Absolutely not. He's fourteen. I won't," she insisted, shaking her head. Rio had always been stubborn, and she fought for those whom she believed in, and Nicky was at the top of that list, just above Agatha. Her eyes bore into her wife's, watching how deeply glassed over they were, like the tears were nearly pleading to fall, but Agatha visibly swallowed them down.</p><p>"I'm glad I'm not the only one who felt that way," she whispered back, reaching up to brush Rio's cheek with her thumb.</p><p>So, they had pushed. Sometimes, they had begged for one more day, and then found reasons for him to want a few more. It was another five months, but they reached the day of celebration again. He was cancer free, and things seemed to be on the up and up. Rio had had more than one conversation with him about his feeling that the dips would be inevitable from there on out, and she knew he could be right, but promised him they would be there for him through it all. His fifteenth birthday came, and then his sixteenth.</p><p>And there she stood, four months after his sweet sixteen, gazing at him with that soft look in her green eyes. He had eyes that much mirrored her own, but he bore Agatha's nose, and her smile. It was ironic, because she knew he was not biologically hers, but when her eyes met his for the first time? There had been no doubt in her mind that he was her son.</p><p>His hair was dark and tousled atop his head, though Agatha had been warring with him for months about getting it cut.</p><p>"You're wearing it down?" Rio asked, quirking a brow at him.</p><p>"Well, I mean. For pictures, yeah. But you know I never play in anything other than a man bun," he returned, his smile growing. He couldn't withhold his laughter as Rio rolled her eyes at him.</p><p>"Is mama going to pick me up after practice?" he asked, glancing over to give himself a survey in the mirror.</p><p>"Yes. She said she'll be walking out of the precinct in time to get you. And I asked her three times if she would be on time. She did promise me that she would be, but we shall see." Rio's eyes shimmered for a moment with a soft affection for the other woman. She loved her wife, even if some of her quirks were... well, a little difficult to handle sometimes.</p><p>"Oh, cut her some slack. She's got the highest arrest record in the entire department. I'm pretty sure she knows who D.B. Cooper was."</p><p>At this, a truly delighted laugh leapt from Rio's lips. She had always loved Nicky's sense of humor, but he had definitely stuck the landing on that punchline. His smile was sheepish, but she knew he was right. Agatha was a damn good detective, and she had earned every bit of everything she had in life, but Rio also knew she wanted more. She had been dangerously close to being promoted to chief multiple times, but it always seemed to slip out from beneath her grasp. Rio knew it would have meant everything to her, and so she kept rallying behind her, encouraging her to keep her head up, to keep doing what she did best, which was sleuthing out whatever mystery was placed in front of her.</p><p>"Are you ready, kid?" Rio asked as she headed toward the door, reaching up a hand to ruffle Nicky's hair with a gentle chuckle.</p><p>"Yes, mother," he droned a bit sardonically, though as Rio's head snapped around, the grin he was wearing was instant and also infectious, as it spread on her lips as well.</p><p>------------------------</p><p>"Yes, my love, I am pulling up now," Agatha assured, though there was an exasperation to her tone that, try as she might, she was unable to hide. Rio had been a little more insistent than usual about Agatha's ability to be punctual, and while she had truly been working on it, there was still a lot of room for growth.</p><p>Slowly, her SUV rolled to a stop at the curb, her eyes lifting to take in the sight of the lit up soccer field that was dotted with high schoolers. She could pick Nicky out of any crowd, jogging up and down the field with that knot of hair bouncing atop his head. She knew they were lucky; he was a smart kid, gifted in every right way. He spent most of his time in sports, or in choir. They never missed a game, or a performance. She and Rio sat side by side each time, their elation seeming to circulate out of herself and into Rio and back again through the contact of their palms as they held hands.</p><p>"Are they finished?" Rio asked, and Agatha skipped a beat before the question processed.</p><p>"Shit, sorry. It looks like they're finishing up now. He's grabbing his things. Do you need anything?"</p><p>"For my loves to come home to the banana bread I baked for after the pizza I ordered," Rio responded, and Agatha could feel the warmth come to her cheeks in an instant. She was about to respond, but the passenger door opened and a sweaty and red Nicky folded into the seat.</p><p>"How was practice?" she asked, her eyes sparkling with wonder at this human being she had created.</p><p>"Hot," Nicky replied with a soft chuckle. "Home and a shower is in my future," he added.</p><p>"Yes," Rio agreed over the Bluetooth connection. "Straight home." There was a little more conviction in her tone at the last two words, though Agatha tried to ignore it.</p><p>"Hi Mom!" Nicky chirped, causing Rio's heart to thud a little harder in her chest.</p><p>"Hey, baby boy. I got pizza and made some banana bread for when you get here," Rio informed him, to which he lit up.</p><p>Agatha put the car in reverse and the three of them held light conversation for a few moments as she drove before a call began to beep in on Agatha's phone. "Shit."</p><p>"What?" Rio asked.</p><p>Agatha glanced at their son, then back at the road. "It's the station."</p><p>"Agatha! No! We talked about this."</p><p>"It'll be quick, I promise," Agatha countered. "I love you!"</p><p>With that, she pushed the red call button, cutting the call off before Rio could make any argument. Truthfully, Agatha knew she was so close to making chief that she could almost taste it, and if she was able to help as much as she could, she knew it could only fast track her.</p><p>She answered the incoming call, speaking with the dispatcher, Jen, briefly as she indicated that the current chief requested Agatha's presence at a scene that happened to be only a few blocks from where she currently was. She told her to relay the message that she was on her way, and hung a right at the next intersection.</p><p>"Mom's going to be mad," Nicky informed her, but she waved a hand to dismiss him.</p><p>"She'll forgive me."</p><p>"You work too much," he said softly, his gaze cast out the window. He loved both of his parents, but he could see the toll the long hours his mama worked were taking on her relationship with his mom. He wasn't blind, or stupid.</p><p>"I know, kid," she breathed with a sigh as she pulled along the curb a few houses down from the clearly marked crime scene. She reached over and pulled a pair of gloves out of the glove box and opened the door, turning her head to face Nicky. "Lock the door, I'll be ten minutes tops."</p><p>Maybe she'd had every intention of that being true, but as she slid on her gloves and made her way back down the block, she did not realize how badly she had severely underestimated just how much time she had left.</p><p>Normally, Agatha could have told you every single thing she noticed when she walked onto a crime scene the first time, but that one? In her memories, it had become nothing but a black hole. She should have never stopped. The one thing she knew she would never forget, though, was that at about the six minute mark of her being there, she heard them. The gunshots were ringing and clear, a sound she would recognize anywhere. Instantly, the panic gripped her by the throat and she dropped the knife she was holding to bolt back outside.</p><p>Down the block, a car was whipping around the corner, and she assessed the street before them. She took off at a dead sprint toward her SUV. She came around the passenger's side to see the right side of Nicky's head pressed to the window. "Open the door! Nicky, open the door!" she urged him, jerking on the handl to no avail. She could see him breathing, his chest was rising and falling rapidly, and his arms were hugged close to his body, but he otherwise didn't move. "Nicholas!" she yelled, nearly beating on the window. She stopped, but only to bolt around to the other side of the car. She slammed her elbow into the window several times before it finally cracked, and once more before it shattered and she reached in and was able to unlock the door. What she saw when she looked across the vehicle, though? Nicky was bleeding, and bad. He was clamping his hands to his side to try to quell the pain that was written all over his face, but she could see that he was losing too much blood too fast.</p><p>"Dispatch!" she shouted into her radio. "I need a bus. My son has been shot!" she wailed, throwing down the receiver as she scrambled to the other side, pulling the door open so she could pull Nicky out.</p><p>She struggled a bit, but removed him from the car, and while some part of her had known it as she was hoisting him out, the realization didn't set in until she got him on the ground and looked down at his face.</p><p>His skin was pale, and his entire jersey was stained in the blood she hadn't been able to staunch. His head lulled to the side, the color gone from his lips and cheeks that had been so pink with heat not moments ago. She immediately hit the ground</p><p>"No," Agatha cried. "No. No no no no no. No. Nicky. Nicky, baby, it's me. It's mama," Agatha began to beg, and plead as she gathered him into her arms, pulling him into her lap as her hand ran over his hair, the tears falling from her own cheeks landing on his white skin. "Nicholas. Please. Please don't go."</p><p>"Please, baby. Please come back."</p><p>----------------</p><p>Rio's jaw bulged on both sides as she stared down at her phone, punching in the dial button for Agatha's phone for an thirteenth time in the last ninety minutes. She was growing agitated. But, then, when she called Nicky's phone and there was no answer? Something in her stomach plummeted like a stone. Something was wrong. Something wasn't right, and she needed to know what it was. She tried Agatha's phone again, but there was no answer. Her lips pressed together in a thin line and she stood, grabbing her keys and sliding on a pair of shoes.</p><p>On her way out to the garage, Rio pulled up their family tracking app so that she could see their location and set her directions to take her there. Halfway there, though, the locations began to move. She was still about ten minutes away, so she watched and followed, until she realized where they were going. The hospital. She was sending text after text to Agatha's phone, some along the lines of 'What the fuck is going on? Goddamnit, answer me. Are you going to the hospital?! AGATHA!' Still, there was no response. She pushed down harder on the gas, watching on the mounted phone screen as Agatha and Nicky's bubbles stopped moving; she was a minute behind, nothing more. She pulled into the parking lot just in time to see someone else getting out of Agatha's SUV. It was Alice, one of the other detectives on the force. Rio slammed on the brakes and put the car in park, throwing the door open despite still being in the middle of the lot. "Alice!" she called, jogging over to her.</p><p>For a moment, there was a flash of something across Alice's face, but Rio was too distracted to notice. "What the fuck is going on? Where are Agatha and Nicky?" she asked.</p><p>Alice's throat quivered visibly with the answer she did not want to give. "They should already be here. The squad left before I did. She asked me to bring her car."<br />
The dryness of Alice's answers were only leaving Rio more unsettled. She was hiding something, of that Rio was sure, but she just wanted to see her family.</p><p>In an instant, she was marching through the ER doors, heading straight for reception. She announced who she was, why she was there, and demanded to see her son. The nurse had asked her to calm down and lower her voice, but this only angered an already fragile Rio.</p><p>"You WILL let me see my son RIGHT THIS INSTANT!" She bellowed, and the nurse had picked up the phone, no doubt to call security, but a door pushed open and Agatha came rushing out, having heard the sound of her wife's shouting, though she was in no way ready to face her.</p><p>"Rio, Rio, hey. Come here," Agatha said softly, ushering her back and away from the desk.</p><p>"Agatha, where is he? Why isn't Nicky with you?" she asked, her face flushed and her throat tight. "Nicky was with you, Agatha, where is he?" her tone was frenzied, panicked, and she could feel the pressure building inside of her check. "AGATHA!" she shouted, her eyes glassing over. "Where is he?!" she asked, her hands flying wildly around in front of her.</p><p>Swiftly, and adeptly, Agatha caught Rio's wrists mid-air, pulling her closer. "Let's go outside, love," Agatha managed, knowing they needed to have this conversation away from any prying ears.</p><p>Rio realized in that moment that Agatha was not going to answer her question. She jerked her wrists from out of the other woman's grasp, her jaw clenched as she marched toward the doors that spilled out into the parking lot. Her fists were balled up at her sides so tightly that her nails were digging into her skin and her knuckles were white. Agatha was right behind her, and Rio knew that if she would have opened her arms as she spun around, she just might have hit her, and she wasn't sure if that was actually a bad thing or not.</p><p>Her eyes met her wife's and her face screwed up in determination to not completely break down. "Tell me," she barked, her eyes narrowing.</p><p>"Rio..."</p><p>"I felt it, Agatha. Just say it."</p><p>Agatha's cheeks were wet with the tears she had been crying for the last two hours. She was shattered, and she knew that facing Rio? She didn't know how she was going to survive.</p><p>"Nicky's gone, Rio," Agatha choked, and every single drop of blood that ran through Rio's veins froze over. She was stuck, cold and still as she stared at the other woman. She blinked, she tried to swallow, but she felt like she was going to throw up.</p><p>"No," Rio responded, shaking her head. She had known it, but hearing Agatha say it out loud? She wouldn't, couldn't believe it. "You're lying."</p><p>"Rio, please."</p><p>"Stop lying," Rio spat, advancing on her.</p><p>"Baby..." Agatha managed weakly, though she did not step back. She braced for what she knew was coming. Rio's palms touched her chest with force, but she only staggered a half a step, bracing for the next shove. And then another. The fourth time, Agatha stayed still, but used Rio's momentum against her, pulling her in to wrap her up in her arms. The moment she did, Rio let out the most hollow, loud, heartbreaking wail Agatha was sure she had ever heard in her life.</p><p>Her hand smoothed over Rio's hair as she sobbed, rocking her side to side, shifting her weight.</p><p>"Let's go home," Agatha suggested, but Rio was lightning quick in pulling away.</p><p>"No, I want to see him."</p><p>"Rio, I don't think--"</p><p>"You don't get a say. The only reason I haven't asked you what did happen is because I know it wouldn't have happened if you would have just done what I asked you, and came home. You didn't listen to me, Agatha, and now he's cold and alone in a drawer in there. I deserve that much. I deserve to say goodbye."</p><p>Agatha looked like Rio had landed a hefty slap across her face, blinking at her in surprise. She opened her mouth to speak, but Rio cut her off.</p><p>"And I don't want you in there with me."</p><p>Rio stiffened and smoothed a few wild strands of her hair and wiped at her eyes, trying to make herself look presentable enough to enter the hospital again without having a complete meltdown. She needed to be composed, at least for the next twenty to thirty minutes.</p><p>Agatha wanted to reach out, to hold her hand, to beg her to let them go together, but she could still see that fire burning in Rio's eyes, one that burnt her through her gaze. So, she let her go, watching after her as she made her way back inside the hospital to say goodbye to their son. She bowed her head, her eyes on her blood stained palms, the tears welling up in her eyes. Her aunt's voice rang in her ears, a haunting memory.</p><p>"Death comes for us all."</p>

  <p>Agatha could not have put an estimate of how many minutes it had been from the moment she had pulled Nicky out of the car to the point when she had felt Alice's hands on her shoulders. Agatha was still weeping, still begging both Nicky to come back, and also for someone to just help him. The red and white lights licked every flat surface they touched, but all Agatha could see was her entire world burning down around her reflected in those lights.</p><p>In that moment, nothing else existed. It was just Agatha and Nicky. It was just the two of them, the only two in the world as she held onto him for dear life. Her hand had never once stopped its soothing motion over his hair, like she had done every time he had laid down with his head in her lap. In a way she would never get to do again.</p><p>She had known before the paramedics had arrived that he was gone, that she was holding her dead son in her arms, singing soft lullabies to him in hopes that in his eternal rest, he could still hear her. Still, when they tried, when they really tried, Agatha had been hopeful, for just a moment, that they were at least loading him into the squad. She had handed Alice her keys and asked her to meet them at the hospital, to which the other woman had easily agreed. She climbed in the back of the ambulance and picked up Nicky's cold, limp hand, squeezing it tightly in her own. She willed the life out of her own body, willed it into him, but nothing happened. Why wouldn't it work? Why couldn't she give up herself so that her son could live?</p><p>The entire ride, she focused so hard on him, on what she had done, that it was difficult to really think about much else. They brought him in, but he was pronounced mere minutes later. She was in the hallway in a discussion with the doctor, though she had been trying to stop the flow of tears that had started the moment she had laid eyes on him in that car. She had been trying to be compassionate and understanding, but she just felt numb, hollow, empty, completely void of any emotion. That was, until she heard yelling from down the hall, on the other side of the doors that let out into the emergency room waiting area. That was a voice she knew. Rio. Fuck. With as guilty as she was already feeling, the fact that she had not once given a single thought to her wife in the whole ordeal seemed to multiply that by tenfold. She excused herself from the doctor and pressed out to try and handle this the best way she could, though she knew doing that was not going to fair well for either of them. At this point, there simply was no other option.</p><p>-------------</p><p>"I'll give you a moment," the nurse voiced softly from behind Rio as she stared ahead at the lifted table, a sheet draped over the five foot eleven inch frame of her son who laid atop it.</p><p>She felt frozen, paralyzed, like the idea of taking a single step toward him would kill her. As she took the first one, she thought it just might. And then another. A soft sob escaped her and she clapped a hand over her mouth to stifle it, despite the fact that there was no one else in the room. The tears were flowing by the time she reached the side of the table. She lowered her hand, the tears still spilling, as she lifted the side of the sheet, picking up Nicky's hand in her own. It didn't feel like Nicky's hand. That wasn't the same hand she had held for over a decade. It couldn't be.</p><p>Her thumbs gently brushed over the back of his knuckles as she reached up to fold the sheet back from his face. Another sob, but this one, she did not try to contain. She let the sheet go and reached up, her fingertips brushing over his greying cheek. Her lip quivered and she sunk her teeth into it to try and give herself something else to focus on other than the debilitating pain in her chest. "Nicky, baby," she managed in a choked whisper as she cupped his cheek in her palm. His hair was still tied up in that bun, though through all of the movement, strands had fallen out and jutted out in wild curls. Those wild curls on her wild boy. She stayed in there for nearly as long as they would allow, though they never actually sent anyone in to collect her. After a good while, she finally found it in her to gather what little courage she had in order to walk out. Before she could, though, she leaned over him, pressing her lips softly to his forehead.</p><p>"Mommy loves you, Nicky. Always and forever, in every star that's in every galaxy. I'll see you again, sweet boy."</p><p>She placed one more soft kiss to his forehead before she somehow ordered her body to operate in such a way that she was able to cover him again, and remove herself from the room. It wasn't an active thought; in fact, she was almost certain she had blacked out, but she kept pushing. She had to get out of that hospital. But where would she go? Home wasn't at the top of her list; she honestly had no idea how she was supposed to face Agatha. Agatha, who gave a shit about no one except the two of them and yet, be the same Agatha who had defied her wishes for the sake of what? A promotion? Agatha, who had put their only child at risk. Agatha, who was the reason he was gone. Agatha, who thought she got to dictate how Rio chose to grieve. How could she go home to look in her in the eye? In many ways, she felt as though should could not be held responsible for anything that might have come out of her mouth if they were face to face. She could reach out to her step-sister, but more often than not, it seemed as though Wanda was just as preoccupied with her own family life, and Rio had no desire to be a burden.</p><p>As she climbed into her car and started it, she had still not settled upon a destination. What was she supposed to do? Nicholas had been every single day of Rio's life for the last sixteen and a half years, since the moment they had found out that Agatha had been pregnant. She had lived and breathed for that child since the day his existence entered her realm. He had been her entire world. She would have gone to any end of the world if it meant she could have him back. So what did she do when she knew that wasn't a possibility?</p><p>What was the last thing Agatha had said to him? Had she told him she loved him? Had she made sure that he knew he was their sun, their moon, and their stars? She knew the likely answers to those questions, but they weren't answers she wanted to hear.</p><p>Her hands had been gripping the steering wheel so hard that her knuckles had cracked, causing her to realize what she had been doing. She leaned forward, pressing her forehead to the steering wheel as she let out the cries she had been holding onto since the moment Agatha had said those words, the ones she had wanted so badly to will into being untrue. She had seen it, she had felt it. She had held his hand in hopes that he felt her there, that he felt loved enough to move on, to cross whatever bridge led him to those stars he so loved to watch every night. How was she supposed to go home when he was never going to be there? How was it even still home, if he'd never be back?</p><p>By the time she had been able to manage a slow enough heart rate that she felt comfortable enough to drive, she had picked up her phone to see that it was just after three in the morning. She turned the car back on, having forgotten at what point she had turned it off, and found herself driving the familiar roads back to the house. She cut the engine in the driveway and simply sat there, staring at the exterior of the home. She just kept turning it over in her head. She didn't want to be there right then, didn't want to see Agatha's face, or hear her voice. She still had no real grasp on what exactly had happened, aside from what the doctor had shared with her, which had been enough to make her vomit shortly after their conversation. He had bled out fast, which meant he had been alone. He had been alone.</p><p>The smallest corner of her mind, it knew. It knew that she was angry, that she was devastated, that she was hurting in unimaginable ways, but it was the quietest voice there. It was doing all it could to remind her of why she had fallen in love with Agatha, of what had motivated her to show up with flowers every other day, to start their own garden that they had always tended to together, to learn to cook her favorite meal. It was trying to remind her of every single year that was filled with infinite good memories. It didn't matter, though. Not anymore. There would be no more memories. They would be no more giggles, no more tickles or food fights. The days of laughter and warmth and happiness? They were like everything else with Nicky suddenly was: nothing more than a memory to look back on.</p><p>After another twenty or so minutes, Rio removed the key from the ignition and climbed out of the car, though each of her limbs felt as though they weighed a ton a piece. She was quiet as she made her way into the house, locking the door behind her. She turned to face the dark house and felt her emotions well again. She pressed forward, glancing over at something that seemed out of place in the living room. Agatha was asleep on the couch, the blanket half hanging over her, half on the floor. Rio stared for a hard, long moment before she quietly floated over, adjusting the blanket so that she was entirely covered. She did nothing else, and turned around, carrying herself up, step by step, to the second floor of their home. She undressed and pulled on a pair of pajamas; it was the pair they had all gotten two Christmases ago, picked out per Nicky's request. They were purple plaid and had stars on them, her favorite of all the ones they had ever gotten.</p><p>Once changed, she had moved to the foot of the bed and stared down at it. She didn't want to sleep there. It wasn't the thought of being alone in it, or not sleeping next to Agatha. No, she just... didn't want to be there. Didn't want to lay in what used to be, what might never be again. She grabbed her pillow from her side and shuffled out of the room and down the hall, quietly opening the door to Nicky's room before she slid in and shut it just as quietly behind her. She turned, her eyes sweeping over the room. It was the same as they had left it when she had taken him to practice early -- Almost. Her eyes dropped to the floor, falling on Agatha's shoes. Apparently, Rio thought, she was not the only one to have had such an idea. She was thankful, though, that at least Agatha had had the courtesy -- or maybe even the sense -- to let her have this when she could bring herself to come back home.</p><p>She let her eyes trace over the room in the light of the moon and then moved over to his computer chair, her hand falling on the hoodie that was draped over the back of it. She felt the fabric, soft and smooth, beneath her fingertips. She gathered it in her hand and lifted it off the chair, bringing it to cradle it in both hands as though it were a precious gem. She brought it up to her face, gently breathing in the scent of the cologne and body spray Nicky so often wore. The tears stung, but she blinked them back, choking them down. She moved to slide the hoodie over her head before she crossed back over to his bed. She turned on the fan that sat on the night stand and slid under the blankets, pulling them up to her chin. She laid there like that for as long as she could manage, though her eyes never once stopped leaking, dampening the pillowcase beneath her face. By the time she had exhausted herself to the brink of passing out, the sun had started to barely climb over the horizon. Instead, she let herself be pulled into the dark haven of sleep.</p><p>--------------------------</p><p>Although she had not moved even the slightest of muscles, Agatha had been awake when Rio had come home. It had been her worst nightmare that she wouldn't. It had been eating at her that maybe something might happen to her, too, and then what? Then she was responsible for the deaths of her entire family? Their blood would be on her hands for an eternity, something she would never be able to wash out so long as she lived. She thought, though, that if Rio did come home, she deserved to have the bedroom, if that was there she wanted to be. Either of those rooms, really.</p><p>Agatha had spent her own time in Nicky's room. She had even pulled the stuffed Iron Man bear they had made when he was eight out of the corner where he kept it safe with the intention of keeping that one piece of him for the night. She would give Rio every bit of the rest of it, but she needed something. It hadn't helped, much, but it smelled like him, and that was the slightest bit of comfort. Once she heard Rio's feet fade out up the stairs, though, the exhaustion finally won out. She was spent, in every way, and she was certain that if she hadn't been, she would have stayed awake fighting herself for the entire night.</p><p>She'd gotten a text from the chief that he was aware of what was going on, and that she obviously should not show up to work. She had thanked him after she had woken up to see the message and then put her phone back down. She knew Rio had come home, but had she stayed home? She looked out the front window and saw Rio's car next to the SUV in the driveway, the bullet hole in the driver's side door so much more noticeable in the light of day. Fuck. The tears prickled furiously at the backs of her eyes, but she did everything she could to blink them back. She spent the majority of the morning pacing, trying to figure out what the hell she was supposed to do from there. She knew that obviously there were the unwanted tasks of taking care of his body, of the funeral, of everything after, but she was not even sure she was going to be able to get that far. She had been so far in her own head, for hours on end, that she had not once heard any movement coming from upstairs. In fact, when she heard Rio's heavy footsteps on the stairs, it was the first time in hours that she even remembered the other woman was still there. As her gaze lifted to see her, though, Agatha did not like what she saw. Rio was being so heavy footed because she was carrying a suitcase. Not her own, but Agatha's.</p><p>"What-- Rio. Rio, come on. We should talk about this."</p><p>Rio dropped the suitcase on the ground at her own feet. "I've packed the majority of your clothing and personal items. There's an empty duffel on the bed for anything else you want to grab."</p><p>Agatha's eyes were wide, her mouth agape in shock. She couldn't be serious. No, they'd been through so much. They had conquered mountains they'd never once thought they could. And this was just... it? She was so ready to give up the last twenty years of their lives? Because Agatha had made a mistake?</p><p>"You're... kicking me out? Rio, come on."</p><p>"Agatha, this isn't up for debate."</p><p>The ice on the edges of Rio's words stung as they flayed her open. It wasn't even what she said, it was every bit of how she had said it. There was no emotion. It was so cold, so devoid of care, of affection or love. Her eyes were stinging again, but she recognized almost immediately that the threat there was far more imminent this time.</p><p>"Please... please let me stay."</p><p>The placidity of Rio's face sent a shiver up Agatha's spine. There was absolutely nothing there. It was a blank slate, not a single light in her eyes. They were dark, stormy, and the longer she looked into them, the more she realized that there was never going to be any beacon of hope to look for in them.</p><p>"Rio..."</p><p>"I want you out." Agatha had never once before heard such assertiveness in Rio's tone, and she had heard that woman be assertive many a-times in her life. This, though, was fueled by anger, fueled by pain and desperation.</p><p>"I want to stay..." Agatha managed back in something that was barely stronger than a whisper.</p><p>"You don't get that as a choice. You leave and you don't come back. You tell me where I send the divorce papers and you sign them."</p><p>The night before, it felt like Rio had slapped her, but in that moment? Right then, Rio might as well have just stabbed her in the gut. She felt physically wounded. That was it? There was no conversation, no talking it out? There was just no hope, whatsoever? She was supposed to just accept that as an answer?</p><p>"This... it's our house. We built this house..." Agatha attempted, her eyes sweeping around them.</p><p>"It's my house. You don't get to take my memories of him, too."</p><p>And as though she genuinely had been physically stabbed, Agatha let out a choked gasp, feeling in every inch of her body like Rio had flayed every single nerve she had. Her wet eyes had overflowed and the tears had started a constant flow down her cheeks. She blinked at Rio, in complete shock over the severity of the injury she had just dealt. She still felt it, stinging in every part of her that she was conscious of. She somehow swallowed down the boulder sized lump in her throat and gave a terse nod, pursing her lips to keep herself from showing any more emotion. She stepped forward and picked up the suitcase. "I'll come back for anything when you're not here, so you don't have to see me. I promise it'll just be to pick up anything else. You can still trust me with everything else."</p><p>At this, Rio barked a dry laugh. "Agatha, I wouldn't trust you to do anything other than think about yourself."</p><p>Agatha tucked her chin to her chest; she knew she couldn't fight back. She knew that in all honesty? Rio was probably being pretty gentle for what had happened; this could have been a lot worse. Agatha understood it. Although Rio was taking this so hard, they had both lost a son that night. Yes, it was because Agatha had fucked up and done the wrong thing, but she was still his mother, too. She had carried him for nine months, gotten to know him before he had ever even taken his first breath. He had still been her little boy, too.</p><p>"I love you, Rio. And I... you will never know how sorry I truly am." She gripped at the handle of the suitcase and watched as Rio swallowed whatever sentence may have been bubbling up her throat. That steel gaze remained on her face, never wavering, just daring, maybe even begging, her to leave. And so, she bowed her head and let herself out the door and climbed into her car, without a clue in the world where she was going to go.</p><p>The moment that front door clicked, every single muscle that had been fighting to keep Rio on her own feet completely gave and she collapsed into a heap on the floor, a soft cry echoing off of the walls. It had been less than a total of twenty-four hours, and somehow, Rio Vidal had lost everything.</p><p>----------------------------<br />
ONE YEAR LATER<br />
----------------------------</p><p>It had been a year and two days. A year and two days since the worst day of her life. That morning, Rio had found herself, for the first time since the very first night she had been home without him and had slept in there, in the doorway of Nicky's room, taking in the sights of it. It had taken her a long time to come around, even to do a general dusting, but something in her had told it was the right thing to do. She had shut the door and went downstairs, picking her phone up off of the kitchen island to see that her sister had texted her back that she was heading over that way shortly for the dinner Rio had offered to make. However, as she was sending a response, her phone began to ring. It was a number she did not recognize, but it was a local number. She hesitated just a moment before she accepted the call and brought the phone up to her ear.</p><p>"Hello?"</p><p>"Hey, is this Rio Vidal? Nick's mom?" It was an unfamiliar voice, but sounded to be a woman around her own age. The mention of Nicky, though? It nearly stopped her breath.</p><p>"It... it is. May I ask who's calling?" she asked back, trying to keep a firm control on the tone and sound of her voice.</p><p>"This is Noelle's mom, Emma. We met once at that dance-a-thon..." she offered, if it might help Rio recall something. She did remember Noelle; she was a sweet girl, and she had been a really amazing friend to Nicky. Before Rio spoke again, though, the other woman spoke first. "I... Erm, there is really... no easy way to have this conversation, so I suppose I should just come out with it. About ten months ago, we found out that Noelle was four months pregnant. She immediately told us who the father was, which we were already aware of everything that happened the two months before that. And... that was why we didn't reach out. Grief is a horrible thing and we just... didn't want to make it worse."</p><p>Rio was physically sweating almost instantaneously. She wanted to urge Emma to continue, but the other woman did so without prompting.</p><p>"She delivered five months ago. The baby's name is Delilah. And... to be honest... This isn't a call I want to make. But... Noelle isn't handling this well, and my husband and I are just not able to take care of an infant due to his health issues. Before we made the decision to put her up for adoption... Well, we thought we should reach out to you, as a paternal grandparent."</p><p>"I... I have a granddaughter?" Rio stammered, nearly choking on the words.</p><p>"You do," Emma agreed softly.</p><p>And then, with utter and complete ease:</p><p>"I'll take her. I'm going to take her."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Rio had spent the next twenty minutes on the phone with Noelle's mother, laying the basic groundwork for how this might work, mechanically speaking. Emma had stressed that the sooner they could enact such a plan into motion, the easier it would be on their family as a whole. She had detailed Noelle's struggle since giving birth, and while Rio knew it had been a difficult position to be in, she was thankful for the call, and for the opportunity. She hadn't even stopped once in those twenty minutes -- even when Wanda knocked several times and ended up just letting herself in with the spare key -- to consider absolutely any of what all of this meant. She just knew that she had a granddaughter out in that world, one who had no one else who loved her enough to take care of her, to raise her.</p><p>Wanda had placed herself on the edge of the couch next to Rio, sensing that she needed to be there as a show of moral support. She let her finish her conversation, trying not to listen in directly, but noting that she was meeting with someone the next afternoon. When she hung up the phone, Rio glanced over, her eyes locking with her sister's.</p><p>"I'm a grandparent," she managed; hearing herself say it for a second time did not make it any easier to believe. Wanda's face was the epitome of shock, and even though it was an exact reflection of what Rio was feeling on the inside, she was honestly still processing it all. After a moment, she didn't want to be rude, but she gave Wanda's hand a light squeeze. "I just need to step out back for a few. I'll be right back, though," she assured her, to which Wanda had promised it was fine, making it an easy exchange.</p><p>Rio grabbed her phone and paced to the back patio, pulling the sliding door shut behind her. She pressed a hand to her forehead, but then began to pace. There was so much to dissect here. Nicky had a child. A baby girl. A baby girl named Delilah. She hadn't thought to ask for photos, but she was set to meet them tomorrow to pick her up, so she supposed that would be the best time as any. She had absolutely nothing for a baby. That was her second qualm. She was more than prepared to tackle this on her own, though she knew that Wanda would jump into action if asked. And then, it hit her like a speeding train.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>She halted in place, her pacing stopping immediately as she buried her face in her hands. Fuck. Agatha had a right to know. She was his biological mother, after all, and this baby was biologically her granddaughter.</p><p>"Fuck!" she shouted at the sky before hanging her head again. She placed herself in one of the Adirondack chairs and pulled her phone out of her pocket, staring at the empty text screen. She still had Agatha's number saved in her phone, though she had changed the contact name to "N/A." She opened it, and hit 'compose.' She would start to type something, stop halfway through and erase it all to start over again, and it became a vicious cycle for a good ten minutes. Finally, she threw herself back into the chair, staring down at the screen. After a long moment, she managed something, though it was more than lacking in finesse.</p><p>"Hey. If you don't still have my number, this is Rio. This doesn't really need a face to face conversation, but I wanted to reach out to let you know that Noelle Pearson's mom reached out to me. We have a granddaughter and I'm taking custody of her. As her biological grandmother, I thought you had a right to know."</p><p>Before she could second guess it, she sent it. It took only a moment before those three little bobbling dots appeared on Agatha's side of the screen. What followed? Well, Rio really should have expected nothing less.</p><p>"What the fuck do you mean it's not an in person conversation? I'm on my way over."</p><p>Rio heaved a sigh, running a hand over her face before she typed her response.</p><p>"Ok. The door will be unlocked."</p><p>A low and frustrated grunt passed through Rio's lips as she ran a hand through her hair. She took in a slow, deep breath that she tried to keep even. Truthfully, she was only holding it together right then because she knew she had to. She couldn't afford a breakdown at this point in time and so she was going to do whatever she could to simply keep pushing. She had no other options. She lifted herself to her feet and made her way back inside to Wanda who was scrolling through her phone.</p><p>"Hey, I know I promised enchiladas, but um... Something's come up and Agatha is on her way over."</p><p>At this, Wanda's brows hiked in surprise. Well, that was certainly a new development. "Are you sure you don't want me to stay?" she offered; it wasn't a dream to be a buffer between those two women, but she loved Rio and she would have done whatever it was she needed. Family was Wanda's priority, and Rio was more than that for her.</p><p>Rio offered her a warm smile and reached over to give her arm a gentle pat. "I appreciate it, but I'll be okay. We just... I'll call and explain later. Honestly, right now none of it is actually making any sense in my head."</p><p>Wanda's lips twisted in thought for a moment. "Have you... talked to her since...?"</p><p>Rio shook her head. The day of the funeral had been the last day they had been face to face, and even then, they hadn't spoken. Or -- Rio hadn't spoken to Agatha.</p><p>Wanda got to her feet and leaned down over her step-sister, giving her a gentle hug. "Call if you need anything, okay?" she offered gently as she stood back to full height. Rio nodded and thanked her, though as she heard the front door close behind the other woman, her face fell into her palms.</p><p>She was not ready for this, for any of it. She wasn't ready to embrace the fact that she had a grandchild, wasn't ready to look into Agatha's eyes for the first time in a year and have somewhat of a civilized conversation with her. She wasn't ready to confront the grief she had buried instead of dealing with it. She wasn't ready to see that nose, or that smile again, no matter who wore it.</p><p>She got to her feet, beelining for the kitchen to pour herself a few fingers of whiskey, which she unceremoniously poured down her throat with a quickness.</p><p>All that was left to do was wait.</p><p>--------------------</p><p>Day 4.<br />
The room was dark, thanks to the blackout curtains that hung over the window. As Agatha came to consciousness, there was a smell of coffee lingering in the air. For as much of an inconvenience as she thought herself to be, Alice had been amazing in stepping in to offer Agatha a place to rest her bones. The chief had given her two weeks off, but she had suddenly found herself to be homeless, so the gesture had gone miles for her when Alice had presented it to her. Agatha kept mostly to herself, though. When she wasn't in the fetal position in the shower, she was usually curled up in the bed in the spare room, that little teddy bear clutched tight to her chest.</p><p>How had this happened? How had she let this get so far away from her? It had been one stop, one stop that shouldn't have taken more than ten minutes. Rio had been more firm in trying to pry Agatha away from overtime, and this one time? This one time, she should have listened. She knew she should have listened. Honestly? Forgiving herself for not doing so was likely going to be the longest part of the grieving process.</p><p>Day 15.<br />
Agatha didn't want to do it. She didn't want to put on that black dress, to tie her hair back at the base of her neck, and to have to look at people who saw nothing but pity and sympathy when they looked at her. They surely all blamed her, especially if they'd had any exchange with Rio over it. But, she did it anyway. She showered, she dressed, and she found her way to the funeral home. She had tried to ask for even a moment of Rio's time, but she was met with silence. The other woman, her wife -- er, soon to be ex-wife -- wanted nothing to do with her. And so, they had stood on opposite corners of the room, meeting with people separately who wanted to offer their condolences. She had stolen every glance she could, hoping for just one second where their eyes might meet, but she was never granted such a gift. Instead, as everything started to wind down, Agatha took her leave silently and returned to Alice's apartment to tuck herself away into the darkness for another night, the hole in her chest seemingly gaping without any hope for repair.</p><p>Day 49.<br />
The numbers flashed 4:21 on the clock that sat on the floor next to the full sized mattress of the empty apartment Agatha had moved into two days before. She was sat bolt upright, a cold sweat curling in tendrils down the back of her neck. She had been so lost in her dreams, or were they memories? It was difficult to parse a difference between the two anymore, if she were telling the truth.</p><p>It had been a sunny day, the water was clear at the edge of the lake, and Nicky's laughter echoed off of every surface as Rio's fingers prodded into his ribs, causing him to thrash in any attempt to evade her. He must have been about ten. His hair was down in those wild curls that bounced and moved every which way with his laughter. And Rio. Shrouded in the light of the sun, she looked like she had descended from the heavens themselves. It was a moving picture of her entire world, until suddenly her eyes were open and she was staring at the dark ceiling above her head.</p><p>She was alone. She was always going to be alone.</p><p>Day 132.<br />
There was a call in from the same neighborhood she used to live in. She knew she shouldn't have taken it, but some part of her that couldn't stop hating herself seemed to chomp at the bit. Agatha grabbed her keys and made her way out to her vehicle, sliding into the driver's seat before she started the car. She hesitated, though. Should she at least ask someone to come with her? What if Rio saw her? She physically shook her head, trying to shake the thoughts out, and put the car in reverse.</p><p>The longer she drove, though, the sicker she felt. She didn't want to get closer, but at the same time, it was all she wanted. She had fought many urges in the last three and a half months to at least make sure that Rio was doing okay. As she turned the corner onto their street, her eyes lifted automatically to see the white house with those light blue shutters on the right hand side. She did not slow, but it also felt impossible to take her eyes off of it. The interior was dark from what she could see, lights off or curtains pulled. In the dimming light of the setting sun, it was hard to make the distinction. She wanted to. She wanted more than anything to stop, to just knock on the door, but instead she jerked her chin forward and kept driving. She just kept driving.</p><p>Day 194.<br />
It was the taste of a cupcake. Jen had brought them in for the office for Agatha's birthday. A kind gesture, sure, but one that was going to wound her more than it would ever soothe her. It was almond with butter creme icing. Nicky's favorite, but she hadn't known until she bit into it.</p><p>It was almost refreshing, and then, the flash of a memory of his most recent birthday hit her like a train. The candles, the lights dancing on his face as he blew them out. His arms, wrapped around her neck as he hugged her tight. His lips, pressed to her cheek before he let her go to do the same to Rio.</p><p>Suddenly, she couldn't breathe. She stood abruptly and made her way straight for the bathroom, doing what she could to not completely lose it in front of her coworkers. She locked the door behind her and pressed her back to it, focusing all of her energy on taking long, deep breaths in order to try and still her wildly hammering heart.</p><p>Would it always be like this?</p><p>Day 277.<br />
Another 4am wake up, another nightmare. They had been fewer and farther between, but they hadn't actually stopped.</p><p>Day 365.<br />
It had been a year. An entire year. She hadn't heard the voices of the two people she had loved most in exactly a year. And it hurt. It stung, like an attack of wasps, one that was relentless and wild. She missed them. Agatha missed them, far more than she ever knew she would be able to explain in words. She wanted them back, but that was a dream that she would never have again.</p><p>Day 367.<br />
With a heavy sigh, Agatha undid her holster and dropped it onto the couch. She turned to fold herself into one of the loungers, her phone resting on the arm. She saw it before she heard it; the screen lit up right before it gave off a soft 'ding.' She glanced down and the name on the incoming message about caused her to choke on the breath she was taking. There was no way. Rio was texting her? She blinked a few times, as if it might change what she was seeing. It didn't. She was frozen, staring at it, until something in her mind kicked off that she needed to know what it said. She picked up the phone and unlocked it, opening the message. She read it once. Then twice. Then a third time and yet, she still didn't understand what it said. She blinked again, reading it slower this time. Nicky... had a daughter? She lurched forward, an arm snapping out to grab the wastebasket next to the chair so that she could wretch into it, heaving again and again, though there hadn't been much in her stomach in the first place.</p><p>She wiped at her mouth, picking the phone back up. Immediately she responded:</p><p>"What the fuck do you mean it isn't an in person conversation? I'm on my way over."</p><p>Rio could hate her, which she was sure she did, but this wasn't just something that could be passed over between them. Their son had created a life. A part of their boy, their wild little boy with his wild little curls, was out there in the world. And apparently, Rio was going to be the one to take the step up that needed to be taken for her to be cared for and loved. Agatha had so many questions, needed to know so many things. How had this even happened? Why hadn't they known until now? How was she going to raise an infant on her own? What part was she going to have to be willing to let Agatha play in this baby's life? She didn't get to hoard her, keep her for herself, no matter how much she loathed her.</p><p>She was on her feet, clamoring around the house to change out of her work clothes, throw her hair up into a ponytail and slide on a pair of shoes. She had almost reached the car before she realized she did not have her keys. She huffed, hurrying back in to grab them. She felt completely out of sorts; for as much of a hardass as she could be on a day to day basis, especially in this last year, Rio had always, always been her soft spot.</p><p>It took her a little more than fifteen minutes to get to Rio's, and as she had indicated that the door would be unlocked, she let herself in, shutting the door softly behind her.</p><p>"Rio?"</p><p>"In the den," the soft but steeled voice called from the back end of the house. Just the sound of her voice made Agatha's throat feel like sandpaper. Her palms clammed up instantaneously, getting worse with each step she took toward the back of the house she hadn't been in since the day she had left one year ago. She wiped her palms on her sweatpants and came around the corner to see Rio hunched over the desk in the den, paperwork everywhere on it around her.</p><p>"Hi," Agatha greeted softly. Rio reached up, removing the half-moon spectacles from the bridge of her nose and set them on the desk. She leaned back in the chair, but Agatha could see very clearly that she was building up the courage she needed to bring their gazes to meet.</p><p>Rio could have prepped herself for this a million times, but it never would have worked. She felt her throat squeeze, but she forced in a breath anyway as she managed to turn her head, her eyes sweeping up to that familiar face. That face. That face that she had loved. The face that she had kissed, thousands of times, on every inch of it. That face that she had held in her hands in tender moments, that she had brushed tears off of. That face, it was that face that made her see her son all over again. She felt the bubbling, the tide of anger beginning to swell, but she choked it back and bit it down. It would lend nothing to being productive here, and she knew it. As their eyes met, though, she didn't know what to say. Her lips parted, as if she were going to speak, but then would close again as the thoughts raced through her mind. And then, again. It was a cycle repeating until finally, Agatha cut her off.</p><p>"Okay," she started, reaching over for the empty office chair as she rolled it over closer to Rio, though she left a healthy distance between them as she placed herself in it. "Just start from the beginning. What's her name?" Agatha's voice was smooth as silk, and it was clear that she had easily identified that Rio was fully in crisis mode.</p><p>Rio blinked at her. Yes, probably a good jumping off point.</p><p>"Her name is Delilah. She is five months old."</p><p>"Good, good. And you said Emma and Joel Pearson's girl, right?" Agatha crooned, gently nursing the information out of Rio.</p><p>Even Rio would have had to admit that something about her tone, about the way Agatha was speaking to her... it was... calming? She gave a soft nod, swallowing down the lump in her throat. "So..." Agatha started, her lips twisting. "What's the plan?"</p><p>Rio blinked, but this time it was to stave off the tears. She was honestly playing this entirely by ear. She had no idea what to do. She had less than twenty four hours to find space for and get a nursery built and she had no idea whatsoever how she was going to make it happen.</p><p>"I pick her up at four tomorrow afternoon. I don't... have anything ready." Her voice was small, and if Agatha didn't know any better, she would have said she could hear the fear there, too.</p><p>"Do you..." Agatha began, but then she paused, her lips forming a thin line as she pressed them tight together. Maybe the way she asked this question was probably the most important part. "Is the office empty?"</p><p>Rio looked back up at her, her throat trembling. She knew the question Agatha really wanted to ask: Why not put it in Nicky's room?</p><p>"I can get it empty. There's not much in there."</p><p>"Do you want help?"</p><p>Rio shook her head immediately. No, what she wanted was for this conversation to be over and for Agatha to just tell her she wasn't interested in having a hand in this, but she knew that was wishful thinking.</p><p>"Get it cleaned out and I'll go pick everything up tonight. I can call out and be by in the morning to get it all set up. I --"</p><p>"Agatha."</p><p>"No, it's okay I'll --"</p><p>"Agatha!"</p><p>Agatha's head snapped back toward Rio, her eyes wide and a little caught off guard. She watched the other woman's face, unable to keep from noticing the tear sitting on the lid of her eye. She tilted her head slightly to encourage her to keep going.</p><p>"I... I don't --" Rio bit her lip, swallowing hard. "I don't forgive you." Agatha visibly winced at this, but Rio didn't give her wiggle room to respond. "But I don't know how I can do this on my own. So... Thank you."</p><p>Agatha gave a terse nod. "I'll uh... text you in the morning."</p><p>Rio looked back at the computer screen in front of her, trying to keep her breathing even. "We can discuss what we want custody to look like and how we want to file for the adoption tomorrow. That way you have time to think about if this is something you really want, at least."</p><p>Agatha scoffed, but she realized what she had done and the look that fell over her features was apologetic. "I don't need the time. It's what I want. But yes, we can discuss that tomorrow." Agatha folded her hands in front of her, squeezing them tightly within her own grasp. "I'll text you." She turned and had reached the doorway, but she stopped, her hand on the doorframe.</p><p>"Rio?" She posed, her chin over her shoulder as she glanced back at the other woman. A second too long passed, though, and she realized she had lost her nerve to say what she really wanted to say, so she settled instead.</p><p>"You're a good person."</p>

  <p>Agatha's eyes swept down to the time display on the center console of her car, chewing on her lip nervously. It was barely nearing 8:30 in the morning and the entire back of her car was crammed with almost everything that they were going to need to set up a nursery at Rio's. That was priority one. The thought had crossed her mind the night before that she was going to have to find the space in her own place if they truly did decide to split custody evenly. They'd never had to co-parent outside of a marriage and Agatha would have been lying to say that the thought of it didn't make put her on edge.</p><p>Rio was an amazing mother. That was never really what was in question. The nagging interrogation that raged inside of Agatha was such: What kind of parental figure could she be without Rio in her life? Was it really worth putting this little girl through the experiment of teaching herself how to raise a child alone?</p><p>Of course it was. Of course she was. Delilah. She hadn't even met her and yet, Agatha had this sneaking suspicion that she was going to easily become her entire world.</p><p>Her conversation with the chief had been short and he had been utterly understanding once she had clearly laid out for him what was unfolding in her life. She had even gotten a worried text from Alice when she had not turned up at the precinct that morning. She had assured her that she was fine, that she was just tending to some personal things for the day. She wasn't ready yet. She couldn't have those conversations, answer those inevitable questions that the people closest (though not close by any actual measure) were going to ask her. Yes, she knew what this meant. Yes, she had thought this through. No, she had not patched things up with Rio. Yes, Rio still hated her. No, she had no idea what this meant for the state of her life. She was nearing fifty, and she was essentially starting parenthood over.</p><p>Ironic, she thought, considering her first go of it had ended... Well, poorly, to say the least.</p><p>She was about a half a block from her next turn, leading her down Rio's street, but something caught her eye. A craft store. She nearly pounded the brakes and turned into the lot, not really understanding the pull as she cut the engine and looked up at the storefront. It wasn't typically a place Agatha would frequent, or even really give a second thought to, but something was telling her to go in. So, she removed the keys and got out, locking the doors behind her. She wandered inside, a slow pace as she meandered the aisles, her eyes rolling over the displays, looking but not really. She had completed a tour of over half the store, but then she stopped. It was a full display of multiple pieces deliberately arranged into a mock nursery.</p><p>There was a mobile of wooden stars, their colors of purple, emerald, cerulean. Their colors. Hanging on the backdrop was a mirror, lined in light script writing that had clearly been meticulously cut or carved.</p><p>"What do stars do?" it read across the top.</p><p>And then, lining the bottom in a curve reminiscent of a smile: "They shine."</p><p>The silver and navy moon phases lined evenly on either side of the mirror.</p><p>
  <i>Paper stars. </i>
</p><p>The memory flashed, quick like ightning and Agatha found herself actively choking back the tears that bubbled up within her. She shook her head; this was not the time or the place. She found where each of the packaged items were stored and selected the ones she wanted, which bordered on all of them, and loaded the cart. She paid and exited, then beginning a game of Tetris as she tried to fit everything into the car in what remaining room there was.</p><p>It was just after nine and Agatha punched in a short text that she was on her way and sent it over to Rio. The response unnerved her.</p><p>"K. Door's unlocked."</p><p>Agatha grit her teeth; she wasn't expecting this to be some joyous reunion, but something about Rio's utter indifference really rubbed her the wrong way. They were going to have to face this as a team, something Agatha had thought Rio had realized, based on their conversation the night before. She wasn't doing this to win the other woman back. No, her expectations in that regard were so low they were in Hell, pretty much. This was for their grandchild. This was for Delilah.</p><p>"Is the office empty?"</p><p>A beat, then a reply.</p><p>"It is. I'll be in the den."</p><p>Agatha's stomach twisted in some form of an emotion that she was not quite sure how to identify. This was a side of Rio that Agatha had never really gotten. When Rio had ordered her out a year ago, she hadn't tried to send endless messages, hadn't tried to beg for understanding. No, she was the one who understood, who knew the severity of the atrocity she had committed. It was something she still couldn't forgive herself for. Didn't Rio know that? Didn't Rio know that every morning, when she looked in the mirror, she saw something she loathed, someone she couldn't stand to stare in the face?</p><p>Now, she was on the receiving end of Rio's callous dryness and lack of emotion.</p><p>And it was absolutely miserable.</p><p>She sighed softly to herself, pulling into the driveway of their-- Rio's home. She climbed out of the car and doubled back toward the rear, opening the door. Methodically, she began to pull things out and prop them up against the car, figuring getting it all out first would prove beneficial in the long run. And then, without a greeting or word of acknowledgement, she began the first of a string of several trips in and out of Rio's home, bringing in the furniture and decorations she had purchased. Carrying in the last piece about ten minutes later, she shut the door softly behind her and headed back up the stairs to the office.</p><p>She left the door open, but immediately set to work with an intense precision, methodically cutting boxes open, one by one, piecing the parts together and building something out of nothing. First was the crib. She pulled down the box of tools she had brought in with her and set about her task, her movements deliberate but exact. There was almost a sense of de ja vu falling over her. The last time she had been this focused on anything that wasn't work, it had been when she had been sitting on the floor of the room next door, putting Nicky's 'big boy' bed together. This would be the first of many beds she would build again, she hoped, but then the small flicker of a flame that had just ignited, it was hit by the gust that this was not her home, and it blew out.</p><p>She was methodical in her process, the way she worked silently, the pieces coming together with each fluid move she made. Agatha was nothing if not good with her hands. That, coupled with her smoldering determination? Well, she knew that by the time she left that day, the nursery would be one thing that could be taken off of Rio's plate.</p><p>She had completed the crib, constructed the rocking chair, built the changing table and was putting the finishing touches on the second shelf she'd put together when she heaved a soft sigh, blowing a stray strand of hair from her face. She sat back, surveying her work, not having realized that for the last, approximately ten minutes, she'd had an audience. In fact, if Rio had not set down a piping hot mug of coffee on top of the metal tool box, Agatha might not have known she was there at all. She jumped, her head whipping around to take in the other woman.</p><p>Gods, she thought to herself as her eyes quickly swept up Rio's frame. She was in heather grey sweatpants that cuffed mid calf and a very familiar navy blue hoodie, the animated form of a mascot tiger emblazoned on the front. Nicky's hoodie. She didn't let her eyes linger, and continued her survey.</p><p>Rio's eyes were dark, that vibrant green in them having faded more toward something reminiscent of pine needles. Dark, hunter hues, only accentuated by the soft purple circles that lined the gap between her lower lids and cheek bones.</p><p>So, Agatha surmised, she, too had not gotten any sleep.</p><p>She was still so beautiful.</p><p>"I thought you could use some caffeine. You've been up here a while," she commented; her voice was low, rumbling, and while it was not sharp, there was no warmth there, either.</p><p>"Have I?" Agatha asked, glancing down to tap her phone screen, seeing it light up that it was after 1pm. Well, shit. She glanced back up at Rio. "I should be done no later than 3:30." She knew she had to leave at four, but there was something else. Something that was suddenly nagging at her.</p><p>Rio was stood there in the doorway, watching her, able to see it, the bubbling, boiling, rolling of a question as it clawed its way up Agatha's throat. She had let Agatha help in her own way, and had intended on letting her do so on her own, but she felt the need to show some form of appreciation. And now, she was going to regret it. What came from Agatha's lips was not a question, so much as it was a demand.</p><p>"I want to come with you."</p><p>Rio's throat swelled and closed just long enough for her to miss a few breaths. Her face remained chillingly smooth, and her dark eyes never once left Agatha's face, leaving Agatha feeling unsettled.</p><p>She had known it was going to be a sensitive question, but she hadn't expected the way Rio seemed to look right through her, slicing cleanly from front to back. She swallowed, her own soft gaze not wavering. She was going. She had a right. Wasn't that part of the reason Rio had called her in the first place? Because she felt like Agatha should be involved?</p><p>The heat was scaling the sides of Rio's neck as she fidgeted, picking at her cuticles as she tried to form a response. What came after a moment of hesitation was soft, but it was not entirely shrouded in chill.</p><p>"What do you want out of this, Agatha?"</p><p>My family back, her internal monologue whined, but she had enough sense not to verbalize it. She stared her ex-wife in the eyes for a long, drawing moment as the gears in her own head turned, searching, scouring for the right words, the ones she needed Rio to hear.</p><p>"I want to do the right thing," she managed, though her eyes immediately diverted -- perhaps in shame -- to the floor beneath her.</p><p>Rio's face, beyond Agatha's view, contorted just slightly; it caused a welling of many different emotions that she found hard to instantly temper. She wanted to be angry, but... in that moment, she was just tired. Tired of being so mad at this woman who had spent the last four and a half hours building nursery furniture for a child she was not even taking immediate custody over, in the home of the one person she had hurt most in the world. Maybe she could be angry again tomorrow. Right then, though, she simply didn't have the energy.</p><p>"And... what do you think that is?" Rio asked back from the doorway, her eyes lingering on Agatha's back, hunched and defeated.</p><p>"Loving the parts of him that are left. The right way."</p><p>Before she could find any physical control over it, Rio could feel the tear sitting on the edge of her lower right lid and immediately reached up to wipe it away. She had meant what she had said the night before: Agatha was not forgiven. Maybe she never would be. But there was something Rio had been able to completely ignore in their time apart: Agatha was still human. She had still lost her son, just as much as Rio had.</p><p>"I'm leaving at 3:45," Rio informed her. Her lips twitched, just barely, her eyes still fixed on Agatha's hunched form. She looked so broken, so defeated.</p><p>In another life, Rio's bare feet would have padded across the carpet. Her knees would have fallen into it, plush and soundless. Her hand would have raised, her fingertips tracing the lightest of lines down Agatha's back. The front of her body would have molded perfectly to the back of Agatha's. Her lips would have pressed to the crown of Agatha's head, her arms wrapping around her. In another life, Rio's embrace could have healed the broken and shattered parts of Agatha's heart and spirit, but not this one.</p><p>"So... be ready."</p><p>----------------------------</p><p>As Agatha got to her feet and she lifted her head to survey the room around her, she felt satisfied with her work. It looked like a true nursery, a place their new arrival could lay her head, be protected and safe. That was what Rio did. She was a protector. She was a safe haven. She was heaven.</p><p>She pulled her phone out of her pocket to check the time; she had six minutes until Rio had said she was going to head out. Stuffing the phone back in her pocket, she turned and exited the room, heading for the stairs.</p><p>But there it was. Right there, on the left hand side. The cherry stained wooden door stood resolute in its purpose to keep her out. It was there, taunting her. The gold glint of the handle caught her eye, almost begging to be touched, to be turned, to be pushed. Her eyes flickered over almost every inch of the door, the frame, the handle. She knew what was in there. Or did she? Had Rio kept it the same? Had she emptied it out? What lay within those walls? What was behind that door?</p><p>In her staring contest with the door, she had not noticed that Rio had surfaced at the end of the hallway, having come out of her bedroom. She was staring at Agatha's back again, her eyes flickering over the other woman's form from head to toe, just watching her. She seemed stuck, frozen. And then, Rio realized what she was looking at.</p><p>"Agatha?" Rio called softly.</p><p>Agatha was jarred in that moment for multiple reasons. One: She had not expected her to be up there. Two: She had not realized how long she had been fighting herself on opening that door. Three: The tone of Rio's voice was... different. It was almost something she could have sworn she had never heard before. It was... concerned.</p><p>She turned, blinking at the other woman, clearly trying to regain her footing. Agatha was a vicious person, but it seemed as though that was one trait she could never really muster in Rio's presence. "I... was coming down to see if you were ready. Everything's done... if you want to look..." she suggested, though there was an undeniable tinge of nervousness to her tone. She had not run the decor by Rio first, and she was not sure how well it was going to go over.</p><p>Rio glanced over at the open doorway, then back to Agatha. She offered the slightest twitch of her lips, surely something that was intended to be a smile but did not quite make it. She stepped forward and peered inside; the lilac walls were covered in the plasters of moons and stars. The mobile -- stars -- and those colors. Rio, too, felt the same welling of emotion that Agatha had when she had been in the craft store. She cleared her throat, as if helping shove the feeling back down into the pits of her stomach. The mirror. Again, those tears were begging to fall, but she refused.</p><p>A memory, like white hot lightning, skipped across the neurons of Rio's brain.</p><p>
  <i>"See the snout? And then the way the stars wind like that? It's the body, into the tail. Just like a dragon."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"What's that one called, mommy?"</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Draco," she answered.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Like the wizard?"</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Rio's laughter echoed into the night, her arms tightening around her son, holding him closer from their spot on the balcony. </i>
</p><p>The stars had always been theirs. There had been nights Agatha had joined them, but the stars had belonged, mostly, to her and Nicky. He knew all eighty-eight constellations, knew where they would be in the sky each night. He had asked her questions day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year, until he felt there were no more to ask. Rio had given him every bit of knowledge she'd had, and he had eaten it up. Space had always fascinated him, always been his biggest mystery.</p><p>It was unspoken between herself and Agatha that when he had left them, that was where he would have gone. To be among the hot, burning, bright stars. Nicky belonged in the night sky, always had.</p><p>She cleared her throat again, her eyes rolling upward to stave off the tears that had glassed over her eyes. She absolutely was not going to let herself get emotional in front of Agatha.</p><p>Despite her own personal feelings toward the other woman, she could clearly see what she had done, the effort and time she had poured into such a task. This hadn't been her responsibility, had not been something that she had been obligated to, but she had shown up anyway. Agatha was a selfish human, Rio knew as much, but she also knew that when it came down to it? She would drop everything in her world for those she loved.</p><p>"We should go," she finally managed, tearing her eyes from the room to look over at her ex-wife. Agatha's head dipped once in a curt nod before she turned to head down the stairs. Rio stole one more glance at the beautiful nursery, a sad smile tugging up on the corners of her lips. The last time there had been a nursery in her home, she had been the one to put it together while Agatha had been pregnant.</p><p>And now, it was the only other functional bedroom in the house.</p><p>And her own was still empty.</p><p>She had no desire to fill it with other partners. Agatha had been right about one thing: That house would probably always be their home, no matter how much Rio would insist otherwise.</p><p>Rio turned her head to face foward, commanding her legs to move as they carried her down the same path Agatha had taken not moments ago, finding her standing by the front door.</p><p>This quiet, pliable version of Agatha? It wasn't something Rio was used to. Agatha, the Agatha she had loved, married, and built a life with, had been mouthy. She had been a spitefire, sometimes taking things to the very edge because she knew she could. She was full of passion and flame, but not this Agatha.</p><p>This Agatha was a stranger.</p><p>Agatha's eyes lifted as Rio nearly floated down the stairs. Even in her hatred, even in her anger, she had this gentle radiance about her. She was so captivating, so enchanting. Agatha knew she needed to catch herself, to stop herself before she wound too far down the path of what could have been.</p><p>This was her life now.</p><p>She would follow Rio outside, she would ride silently in the passenger's seat to their destination, she would meet their son's little girl, help Rio settle her in, and then she would leave, only to return to her small, quiet, empty apartment.</p><p>She would be alone. Again.</p><p>She pushed the thought into the far reaches of her mind and snapped her attention back to the task in hand. She stood idly by as Rio grabbed her keys and led them to her car. Agatha had initiated her plan to be silent, and it had been going fairly well. And then Rio spoke.</p><p>"Am I doing the right thing?"</p><p>Agatha's head turned, slowly, as if she needed the time to think of the right thing to say before she took in Rio's profile. She watched her, studying her meticulously, as if to gauge whether or not she had heard her correctly. Agatha had been operating under the assumption, since the moment she had received Rio's text, that there was not a lick of doubt in Rio's mind about doing this. There seemed to be the one crack, there, though, and she was watching it spread through the other woman.</p><p>Agatha knew the right thing to do here. She had to stop the spread before it broke her apart before Agatha could hold her together.</p><p>She started to say something, but before the vibrations of her voice hit the air, she choked it back. Pressing her lips together, she fought a strong urge to reach out, to touch Rio's arm.</p><p>"Would you be doing the same if we still had him?"</p><p>Rio winced. That word, that one word stung, like the snap of a rubber band.</p><p>
  <b>
    <i>'We.' </i>
  </b>
</p><p><i>If <b>we</b> still had him, <b>we</b> would be doing this as a family.</i> The thought was bitter in the stem of Rio's brain, but she didn't will it out into the world. It was not the time, or the place.</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Agatha turned her eyes back to the road ahead of them. She had another question.</p><p>"Do you believe, in your heart of hearts, that even if I wasn't here and wanting to take this on too, that you taking her would be better than letting her fall into the hands of the system?"</p><p>That question had weight. Rio had heard horror stories of the things Agatha had seen happen in foster homes. She knew how the system worked, how broken it was. She knew that if they let Delilah go, and the state took hold of her, she would never be the person she had the potential to be. Her life would be over before it began.</p><p>"I do."</p><p>Agatha's lips twitched upward slightly, though she resisted the urge to look over at Rio.</p><p>"Then I think you have your answer."</p><p>The rest of the ride was quiet, and as they arrived, Agatha had been keeping full intentions of staying in the car, of letting Rio field this, as she had already done so much of the ground work.</p><p>Rio pulled the key from the ignition and got out, mindlessly shutting the door behind her before she turned to head inside the cafe, but immediately noticed a lack of second footsteps behind her own. She looked over her shoulder, her eyes landing on Agatha, still in the car. Her brow pulled tightly together, pinching above the bridge of her nose and she cocked her head to the side in question.</p><p>Slowly, the understanding dawned on Agatha. Rio wanted her there. Agatha unfastened her seatbelt and opened the door, the soles of her boots hitting the ground with a soft thud.</p><p>She was stuck to her code of silence unless necessary as she filed inside behind Rio, letting her take the lead here. The other woman wound her way around to a back corner and as Agatha looked over her shoulder, she could see the woman they were there to meet, a baby carrier propped up on the chair next to her.</p><p>The woman's face was thin, perhaps a little gaunt, her eyes sunken in the slightest bit. It was clear that the last five months of this woman's life, and the first five months of Delilah's life, had not been kind to her. Agatha's lips twisted anxiously as Rio and Emma exchanged pleasantries.</p><p>What followed, though?</p><p>Judging by her body language, Rio was handling this with aplomb. She was handing over papers that needed signatures, taking from Emma medical documentations and other important forms. Rio was certainly a sight to behold, the way she was so charming, so smooth, so gentle despite the fact that Agatha could see it: On the inside? Rio was positively losing it.</p><p>Anything beyond what she could see? Everything else was white noise. She didn't need to hear it, though, to understand the exchange. And then, Rio snapped her fingers in front of Agatha's face. Agatha blinked and Rio indicated the table. Agatha turned her head, realizing suddenly that the other woman was gone, and the carrier had been turned toward them.</p><p>For the first time, the two women leaned forward, peering into the car seat.</p><p>What they saw?</p><p>There was a plethora of dark curls atop of her head, quite a bit of hair for a baby. She was sleeping; her little cheeks were pink, round, pinchable. They were what one could deem as chubby, in the best baby way. Her little chin jutted out beneath the softly pouting lip that surely stuck out from slumber.</p><p>She looked healthy, well taken care of. It was just that no one had found it in them to love her, yet.</p><p>Then, the softest of noises flittered out of the carrier as the little arms and legs of the being inside began to shift and move, kick and swing. But then came the fireworks.</p><p>Her eyes opened and she looked up at the two of them, leaving them both staring down into pools of emerald green, dotted with the faintest flecks of gold and amber.</p><p>Agatha blinked, as if she weren't seeing things correctly. She blinked again, but the view was still the same. She lifted her head just enough to glance over at Rio, who was already looking back at her. They saw it. They both saw it.</p><p>In that moment, they were peering into the eyes of their son, ones he had undoubtedly passed onto his daughter.</p><p>And in that moment, both Rio and Agatha knew: This was always the right thing to do.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>There was a thick air of an awkward tension that seemed to fill the car on the drive back to Rio's. Rio's own mind in the driver's seat was turning circles, oscillating between the weight of the responsibility she had taken on and the sight of that baby's face. There was absolutely no question in the entire universe that she was Nicky's child. She knew that when they inevitably pulled out old photos, they would be able to pinpoint every similarity between the two, would be able to see every glaring feature that linked them together.</p><p>That was a task Rio had already taken to inside of her own mind. There was this baby, this gorgeous little girl, in the back seat of her car, having no idea that the course of her entire life had just shifted. She didn't know that she was now in a safe place, already loved by the two women in the front of the car.</p><p>Rio's gaze cut, just for a moment, over to the woman in the passenger's seat, her fingers nervously picking at her cuticles as she watched out the window, undoubtedly trying to weather the same storm that was rolling through Rio's head. She could see the gears turning, the wheels spinning, and for a moment, it was right there.</p><p>Watching Agatha snap into problem-solving mode?</p><p>It was one of the reasons Rio had fallen in love with her.</p><p>Agatha's fingers moved to pick steadily at a small rip in her jeans, her eyes scanning over the view outside of the car window. She knew she should say something, that she should break the iceberg of tension that was sitting between them. But how?</p><p>Agatha had always been fierce, cutting, bold. She had always had a firm grip on what she saw as right in the world. There had even been these moments, these little flares where Agatha wanted to be angry with Rio. And then reality settled in, and she realized that she was really just angry with herself.</p><p>In the grand scheme of it all, Rio was the innocent party. She had done everything right, she had been right in her requests, and still, Agatha had brushed her off as though her worries had been unwarranted.</p><p>Agatha had made that choice.</p><p>And there they sat, quietly watching the world go by with their granddaughter in the back seat.</p><p>A child that would never know the love of her father.</p><p>The silence had almost been broken by Rio, who had parted her lips to speak, but she was quieted by a soft noise that emitted from the back seat. It was short and a little soft, a sound of dissatisfaction.</p><p>It had been a warning shot.</p><p>Another moment passed, and then it began.</p><p>The wailing was immediate and nearly deafening. The panic set in on both of their faces as they glanced toward one another.</p><p>Agatha's stomach had dropped through the floor of the car beneath them. She had been hoping that they could have at least made it to the house before any signs of trouble, but Rio's plan had become immediately apparent: they were going to try to wait it out. They weren't terribly far from the house, but something in Agatha's chest was ripping, tearing.</p><p>"Pull over," she commanded quietly, but Rio didn't hear her. "Rio, pull over," she said again, stronger this time. Rio's eyes flashed with something unidentifiable, but after a beat, she conceded.</p><p>The soft sound of the blinker was completely drowned out by the screams of the infant in the back, and by the time the car rolled to a stop, Agatha was already opening her door. She shut it gently and shifted around the back, pulling that door open before she slid inside. Glancing down, she could see the cause of turmoil; the binky that had been in Delilah's mouth was now down by her legs.</p><p>Gingerly, she picked it up, her heart still hammering in her chest at the sound the baby was making, frustrated and angry. She held up the binky, gently coaxing her to take it, but she was putting up a fight. She glanced up and caught Rio's eye in the rearview mirror, a helpless look washing over her own expression.</p><p>She was trying.</p><p>The screaming didn't stop, though, and it seemed to only grow in volume. Agatha's lips twisted as she ran through her options. She'd barely considered her own movements before she reached forward, unhooking the straps that kept Delilah safe and secured in the car seat. She pushed them aside and slid her hands in, cradling both of the little girl's sides as she lifted her up, a hand sliding up her back to cradle her head.</p><p>"Hello, sweet girl," Agatha breathed at her, her blue hues tracing over the baby's features as she held her down in front of her, beholding her. She was a beautiful baby, there was no doubt about that. "What's all the fuss about?" Her voice was rich, velvety smooth as she tried her hand at trying to calm her down. The baby's head turned side to side, as if she were insisting she didn't want to answer.</p><p>Agatha pulled her in, tucking her into the crook of her arm as she glanced down at her, a fingertip tracing just barely down her nose.</p><p>This did something.</p><p>There was a catch in the crying, for the briefest moment, so she did it again.</p><p>"See, it's okay. You're okay. You're safe. And you're going home."</p><p>
  <i>Home.</i>
</p><p>Delilah was going home. Agatha wasn't.</p><p>Agatha's focus had been so intent on the baby that she hadn't noticed.</p><p>In that mirror, Rio's gaze never once left her. She watched, with a tight constriction around her heart, as Agatha shifted from the shell of who she was straight into mom mode, all gas and no brakes. She could see that tenderness, that brimming love that was begging to spill over as Agatha's eyes inherited the landscape that was now their future. This little girl, she was theirs.</p><p>Not just Rio's, but theirs.</p><p>She could see it, the way Agatha held her, the way she revered her like she was nothing short of pure gold. Agatha had been a good mom, when it came to being a mom. It was when life's other demands began to press on her that she wavered in her duties as a parent.</p><p>The task at hand was large, and Rio was well aware that they both knew that. But there was something nagging at her, something tugging at the far reaches of her mind, something she had shoved down long ago.</p><p>It was affection. It was this softness that she had always harbored for Agatha, and it had never really gone away. The world could look at her and see the rugged, angry, tortured Agatha, but the view Rio had in that mirror?</p><p>She saw Agatha.</p><p>She saw a mother who made a mistake, a mother who missed her son.</p><p>A flare, a burst of anger surged in Rio's chest.</p><p>Then she should have listened.</p><p>The voice was loud, indignant, but Rio fought to ignore it. Her eyes narrowed the slightest bit as she focused harder on the mirror, on the sight it bestowed upon her.</p><p>There Agatha sat, gently rocking back and forth as she cooed soft murmurs to the baby in her arms. There was a quiet melody flittering from her lips, and whatever it was she was singing, it seemed to be working. The crying was growing softer, and then, she watched as Agatha somehow managed to slip the binky into the baby's mouth, quelling the wailing altogether. There was a brief sigh of relief that passed through Rio's lips, her eyes finally dropping from the mirror.</p><p>"Do you think we could make it home?" The question was soft, in hushed tones, as if Rio were scared of disturbing the peace.</p><p>Agatha's eyes were stuck on the infant in her arms, just regarding her with reverence and astonishment. This was what her life looked like now. This beautiful, chubby, pink little face was her morning, noon, and night, now. The question landed late, and took even longer to process. After a few drawn out moments, her eyes lifted, catching Rio's in the mirror.</p><p>"I think we should be okay," she nearly whispered back, looking back down at the little girl. She was stuck, for just a moment longer, before she shifted, being as careful as she could not to cause any discomfort as she fastened her back into the car seat. Those beautiful emerald pools hardly ever left her face, watching in wonder as this woman moved above her.</p><p>Once everything was clicked and fastened, Agatha reached down, the backs of her knuckles brushing softly over Delilah's cheek.</p><p>"Not much longer, sweet girl. I promise."</p><p>Rio was aching. She could feel the vibration of longing deep within her bones -- and she hated it. She hated that this was stirring things up inside of her that she thought had rotted and decayed. She was not going to go down this road. There was still anger, there was still resentment. There was still this pain inside of her every single time she caught sight of Agatha's eyes in just the right light.</p><p>How could she move on when Agatha was going to be actively haunting her for the next eighteen years, at the very least?</p><p>The other woman gently pressed the back door shut and climbed back into her seat, glancing over at her ex-wife.</p><p>Rio's expression was stoic and placid, unmoving. Something about it caused a knot to rise in Agatha's throat. She was just trying to help, but it appeared as though it had done more harm than good, at least when it came to Rio.</p><p>This was going to be an uphill battle, she thought. Even doing the right thing was still going to be wrong, and she was going to have to find the best way to navigate that. Her gaze fell back out the window as Rio put the car in drive and they began the rest of their journey home.</p><p>------------------</p><p>There was this gentleness about Agatha that was really catching Rio off guard as she took charge of unloading the baby and the majority of her things, making a beeline for the newly established nursery.</p><p>Rio was right behind her, watching with charged interest as Agatha moved about the home like she had never left. As she set the car seat down on the rocking chair, she stepped back, lifting her head up as her gaze swept to Rio.</p><p>"I accidentally got first dibs," she admitted, a bit of guilt coating her tone. "You should be the one to introduce her to her new home."</p><p>Rio felt a stirring of emotion in the pit of her stomach. She could see it, written clearly on Agatha's face, the guilt and the shame. It wasn't just about holding the baby first, Rio knew that. This was their second chance, sure, but Agatha was painfully aware of just how much it meant to Rio.</p><p>Her green eyes held Agatha's blue ones, searching for answers to unasked questions, but she finally tore them away, casting them down into the carrier. An instant smile blossomed on her lips as she took in the sight.</p><p>There was a pooling of warmth in her chest; it felt like looking at Nicky for the first time. Their eyes met, though Delilah's darted around a bit, searching, and Rio felt it all over again.</p><p>This child was hers, and she would do anything in her power to give her the life she deserved.</p><p>The only thing standing in her way?</p><p>Trusting Agatha enough to do the same.</p><p>Carefully and with measured precision, Rio reached down, withdrawing Delilah from the car seat. The baby gave a soft coo, a gentle noise of what Rio perceived to be approval. She pulled her close to her side, cradling her there gently as she gazed down at her face in wonder. Her eyes flickered up to that mess of hair atop her small head, those wild and twisting curls.</p><p>Would she be wild, like her father had always been? Would she be smart, and funny, like he was? Would she love the stars the way Nicky always had? There were so many questions, circling, spinning, looping through her mind that she knew she would have to wait years for the answers, but she couldn't stop them. She looked so much like her father, so much like their son, that it caused Rio's heart to thrum with a dull ache of a new pain, a nostalgia that she had not been accustomed to.</p><p>Rio shifted her weight from foot to foot, just rocking the infant in her arms. And then, it sounded, like a choir of angels singing from the heavens.</p><p>It was the smallest, the sweetest little giggle. It made Rio's heart leap into her throat, and at the same time, she could hear Agatha's breath hitch. Clearly, it had made an impact on both of them.</p><p>Her gaze lifted and took in the sight of Agatha, one arm across her midsection, her other elbow resting on her wrist, her hand poised beneath her chin. There was a subtle look of apprehension across her expression, and Rio felt it again -- that annoying tug. She was stoic for a moment, just studying her ex-wife, her lips twisting uncertainly before she found her voice.</p><p>"You can come closer, you know." She bit back the last part of the sentence: <i>I don't bite.</i> She knew it would land one of two ways, and admittedly, she was not in the frame of mind to be fielding either.</p><p>Agatha's nerves were painted clearly across her face. This was new territory. With Nicky, it had been a joy, an expected thrill that they had waited nine months for. This? This was a complete tornado, uprooting their lives as they had known them. This was sudden, this was life-changing, and Agatha was fighting for dear life to hold on. She knew that if she could hunker down, weather the oncoming storm, the reward would be worth it.</p><p>She took a tentative step forward, and then another, until her front was almost brushing against Rio's side. Rio did not flinch, or shy away. She stood her ground, and honestly? Agatha found some form of unspoken comfort there. Her gaze dropped to Delilah, so snug and secured in Rio's arms.</p><p>There was a sudden wave, a push, a pang that filled Agatha's chest. They had done this before. They had stood in this formation seventeen years ago. This was something she thought they would never do again. This was something she thought she would only ever relive in her dreams. There it was, though, just not in the way she had ever imagined it, or dreamed about.</p><p>The tension between them was still there; a guilt ridden Agatha and a devastated Rio, unable to see through their own pain enough to recognize the kinship, the camaraderie.</p><p>They stood like that for a short while, gently talking to Delilah, giving her loving touches and learning every curve of her features.</p><p>Rio knew she was biased, but damn if she wasn't a beautiful baby. The way her eyes sparkled like her dad's, the way that giggle had sounded, warming the temperature of the entire room, it felt like magick. There had been this undeniable chill in the air since Agatha had shown up that morning, and while it was primarily being put off by Rio's demeanor, she had already started the thaw, much to her own chagrin.</p><p>Agatha was not a bad person. Rio knew that. She knew Agatha's heart, inside and out. Agatha's issue, Rio knew, was that she let those voices in her head overlap the pull of doing what was right in her chest. She was a proud human, one that couldn't bear the thought of someone else being right. Would she admit it when she was wrong? Sometimes, but that stubborn streak ran through her like wildfire.</p><p>Agatha was also not a bad mother. It was a recurring thought Rio had been having, and she found herself circling the drain of it once again.</p><p>She finally lifted her head, her eyes sweeping up as they met Agatha's profile, her eyes still locked on Delilah.</p><p>"Here," Rio murmured softly, nodding down toward the baby, an indicator that she wanted to pass her over. Her eyes flickered up again. "I'm going to go make her a bottle. Will you get her settled?" The question was simple, but Agatha's response was immediate in her expression. It honestly looked like she was on the verge of bursting into tears.</p><p>Rio had no reason to trust her, of that Agatha was certain. Rio had no reason to even think that leaving Agatha alone in a room with a five month old was a good idea, and yet, there she stood, her gaze hot and searing as it pressed into Agatha. Her mouth felt suddenly dry and she forced herself to swallow. She glanced down, and then back up to Rio, as if questioning whether or not she had really considered.</p><p>"Go on, then," her gravelly, low voice offered. It was a push, a light one, almost an encouragement.</p><p>Tentatively, Agatha reached out, her hands feeling only slightly unsteady as she pulled the baby into her own arms, laying her against her chest so that Delilah's head gently lulled to her shoulder. The prickling at the backs of her eyes was strong and undeniable, the tug at her heart feeling like it was going to drag her beneath the surface. Her face turned, just slightly, enough so that she could nuzzle against those soft, curly locks of hair.</p><p>The scent of a baby... it was something else. Otherworldly, almost. It was like an instant high, a lifting of the senses that was almost beyond words. It wrapped Agatha up whole, surrounding her like a warm duvet. It was a feeling of peace, of calm and order. Nothing in Agatha's life had made sense, at least not up until that moment.</p><p>It had been her fault, that was something that had haunted her for a year. But there, staring up at her with pure wonder in that emerald gaze, was hope. Delilah was a do-over, a chance for Agatha to get it right, and to not completely fuck it up. She was depending on her, and she knew she had no other choice but to rise to the challenge.</p><p>As Rio watched, she pushed herself to engage in her task, but as she went to move, she did something she did not even think about.</p><p>Her hand raised, the tips of her fingers grazing just barely over the middle of Agatha's back. It was automatic, a muscle memory of twenty odd years spent together, of an affection that had once utterly consumed her. An affection, she told herself, she had all but obliterated.</p><p>Instantly, as if she had been bit, she jerked her hand back, not missing the way a shiver ripped up Agatha's spine. The touch had been barely there, but of course she had felt it.</p><p>"I'll... be right back," she voiced, her hand still held to her chest as she turned, her footsteps carrying her out into the hall. She turned the corner and then, without hesitation, pressed her back to the wall, a hand moving up to cover her mouth, an attempt to stifle any sound that may have tried to escape.</p><p>This was hard. It was hard to be so upset, so angry, so pained, and yet see the life she had lived for an incredibly long time when she looked at Agatha with that baby cradled so gingerly in her arms. She saw the happiness, the sadness, the tears and the laughter. She saw every first they'd shared with Nicky, and she felt a tinge of guilt over the fact that if she had the initial bargaining of what she wanted, Agatha would miss some of those milestones when it came to Delilah.</p><p>Was that fair? Was it right that Rio was so willing to jump the gun at the chance to strip that from her? Rio didn't know the answer to that. A lot of... well, all of this, seemed to shape itself into one big line of unanswered questions. She was torn, on knowing what the right thing to do was, because her own feelings were standing in her way. It was clear that those maternal bones were still at the structure of who Agatha was, and that the moment she had laid eyes on that little girl, she had spent all of two seconds reconstructing her entire life around the new presence. Agatha was a force, but still an anomaly. Setting her mind to something meant it would be accomplished without question and it was usually a feat to watch.</p><p>But could Rio do it again?</p><p>Could she spend the next eighteen years of her life working in tandem with Agatha to raise Delilah correctly? She stood her ground on the fact that she knew they were over, and that she wouldn't make the same mistake twice... But wasn't she being forced into that position anyway? Sure, they were divorced, and they had spent the last twelve months in utter radio silence... But Gods be damned if her heart didn't falter at the sights she had borne witness to that day. Agatha's tenderness, her affection, her immediate devotion to the new fixture in her life? They were the most endearing parts and pieces of Agatha, and they were hard not to love.</p><p><i>No,</i> Rio told herself. <i>She didn't love Agatha anymore.</i></p><p>The soft cooing and melodies from inside the room had not stopped, even as Rio had finally gathered herself enough to make the voyage downstairs to the kitchen.</p><p>Agatha was enchanted. She was, without hesitation, completely wrapped around that little girl's small, stubby fingers. She was beautiful, and not just because of Agatha's own personal bias. She really was gorgeous. Her nose had the most perfect curve, the little ball at the tip, round and pink. Her lips were thin, but not overtly so, and that chin was strong.</p><p>She had placed herself in the rocking chair she had constructed earlier that morning, cradling Delilah close to her chest, humming softly as she watched her with wonder and excitement filling her eyes. How was this her life? How was it that at this time yesterday, she had been sulking in her misery after another long day at work, and now, she was right there, holding that sweet, beautiful baby in her grasp?</p><p>It just didn't feel real. It felt like a far off dream, one she'd woken up to at 4am drenched in a cold sweat.</p><p>But it was. It was real. Tangible. Right there.</p><p>It had not taken long; by the time Agatha had started rocking, she could clearly see the exhaustion painted across the infant's face, her bright green eyes growing the slightest bit darker with her need for slumber.</p><p>There was this blooming tenderness, right in Agatha's middle. All that mattered to her in that moment was Delilah. It didn't matter that Rio would never forgive her, or love her again. It didn't matter that her coworkers thought her a mean bitch. It didn't matter that her record at the precinct had nearly tanked in the last year. Nothing else in the outside world mattered. What was of sole importance was the slow, gentle back and forth motion of the chair she sat in, watching as sleep began to settle over that tiny face before her.</p><p>She had an inkling that Rio would be, at the very least, annoyed. She had clearly said that her mission was to get a bottle ready, and she was likely to be dissatisfied at the fact that Agatha had let her fall asleep, knowing all of that.</p><p>She could have said that she'd earn that forgiveness back, but the thought struck her dumbly, causing a huffed, sardonic bite of a laugh to just barely escape her lips.</p><p>Delilah didn't budge.</p><p>Forgiveness was not Rio's strong suit, and Agatha was confident in saying she knew that would never change, no matter how much she wanted to hope otherwise.</p><p>She wasn't sure how long she'd been sat like that, the gentle rocking somehow keeping her grounded while also soothing the little girl. A hand raised, brushing ever so gently over those soft curls. Oh, how much she loved her. Every bit of the sixteen pounds she was. She was Agatha's heart, now, the stopper for the gaping hole that had been left open for a year.</p><p>She was her salvation.</p><p>She lifted her head for the first time in a while, and was a little startled to see the form of the other woman in the doorway, those dark green eyes burning straight into her, watching her, observing her.</p><p>"I take it she's not hungry," Rio voiced softly.</p><p>This earned a sheepish smile from Agatha. "I didn't mean to. I just sat down and it took like thirty sec--"</p><p>Rio raised a hand, waving her off.</p><p>"It's okay." She hesitated, her lips twisting in thought. The parts were moving, the hesitance trying to hold them back, but Agatha could see the mask slipping, even if just for a moment. "Are you hungry?"</p><p>Something in Agatha's middle completely shattered. This woman all but hated her and yet, she was still trying to take care of her. Maybe it was out of pity, maybe it was out of empathy. Whatever it was, it was a shock to the system. Slowly, her eyes never leaving Rio's face, she gave a light nod.</p><p>"I'll throw a pizza in. I'll text you when it's ready."</p><p>Agatha's gaze didn't waver, still stuck on Rio. "Do you...?" she offered, glancing down at the baby.</p><p>Rio shook her head. "No, you stay."</p><p>Agatha's eyes softened, as if to ask: <i>Are you sure?</i></p><p>Something happened, in the blink of an eye. Rio smiled. It wasn't a placating turn of her lips, or something forced. It was a real, soft, gentle, genuine smile.</p><p>Agatha felt it, the steady skipping in her chest.</p><p><i>Gods,</i> she had missed that.</p><p>Without another word, Rio turned and made her exit, the bottle sitting left on the shelf beside the door.</p><p>Agatha's heart felt like it was falling apart, unravelling from her carefully knitted walls that she had spent so long trying to keep up. How could Rio do that? How could she shatter her with just one look, without even understanding what she was doing? Why did she still have that power?</p><p>A good twenty minutes later, Delilah was still sound asleep when Agatha's phone buzzed on the shelf next to her. Dinner was ready.</p><p>She exhaled a quiet sigh through her nose, rocking forward to gracefully and very carefully get to her feet. She gently laid Delilah in the crib, covering her with one of the blankets she had purchased that morning. She turned and searched for a box, a soft aha! slipping from her lips as she found it. She spent a minute unboxing and setting up the baby monitor and set it next to the crib before she took the other piece with her, heading downstairs.</p><p>The kitchen was empty, but the pizza was laying on a pan, already cut, with a piece missing. She grabbed one of the paper plates and placed a slice onto it and lifted her head, glancing at the cabinets. She hesitated, for just a moment, before she moved with familiarity toward the one that held the glasses. She pulled it down and filled it with tap water before returning to pick up the plate again. She hesitated in the doorway of the kitchen, her eyes sweeping back toward the den, where Rio most likely was.</p><p>Slowly, she shuffled back, poking her head inside before anything else. There she was, a zippered hoodie hanging loosely off her frame, those half-moon spectacles sitting atop her head. She was leaning forward, an elbow on the desk, her fingers pressing both sides of her brow together in a tight pinch. She was stressed; it was written over every inch of her, but there was nothing Agatha could do, and she knew it.</p><p>Rio's head lifted at the sound of Agatha in the doorway, but her expression remained smooth, untouched by emotion.</p><p>Gods, Agatha really hated it when she looked at her like that.</p><p>"Do you... I mean... Can I...?" she stammered, her eyes darting back and forth across the room.</p><p>Rio glanced over her shoulder at the empty office chair, then back up to Agatha, who looked like a scared teenager at a sleepover with girls way above her own station.</p><p>"Sit," she offered in a soft murmur.</p><p>Agatha obeyed, moving over to place herself in the extra chair. She was quiet, took her time in eating the lone slice of pizza, the silence nearly suffocating her. When she finished, she set the plate down on the end table and lifted her gaze; it landed on Rio's back.</p><p>Somehow, in that entire time of her consuming her meal, Agatha had not noticed at which point Rio had begun to cry.</p><p>It was a soundless sight, just the gentle wracking of her body as it shook with soft, silent sobs. Agatha's lips immediately pulled down at the corners; seeing Rio upset had always jilted something within her, but this was uncharted territory. Here, she was not allowed to care. Here, she had to keep away, per the unspoken rules.</p><p>But it hurt. It ached to just sit there and watch as this woman she knew she still loved so deeply sat there, coming unglued. She could feel the twitching in her muscles, feel the gravity of the situation pulling her toward Rio.</p><p>The silence hung heavy for another minute before finally, Agatha found her courage. She got to her feet quietly and stepped forward, light and soft against the wood floor. She was behind Rio, her eyes still tracing the woman before her. She reached out, slowly, unsteadily, until her palm fell flat against the fabric of Rio's shirt on her shoulder.</p><p>She jumped, but she did not turn around. She didn't even look over her shoulder. She knew who it was, and she knew why she was there. She didn't shy away, didn't try to push back.</p><p>Instead, she cried harder.</p><p>The panic had started to register on Agatha's face, and she was struggling at trying to discover the right way to handle this problem. This was one solution that would never come easy.</p><p>In that moment, Agatha made a make-or-break decision. She leaned forward, folding slightly at the waist as she wrapped her arms around Rio's middle from behind. The truth was, she knew that woman well enough to know what she needed in that moment, and she knew her well enough to know that with how bad she needed it? She wasn't going to push Agatha away if she was going to volunteer to provide it.</p><p>She could feel every tremble, every shake that wracked Rio's thin frame. Still, Agatha held her tight, close. Her cheek was pressed to the side of Rio's head, Agatha's lips just before her ear.</p><p><i>"It's going to be okay,"</i> Agatha tried to soothe, but she didn't know if she would ever convince Rio to believe her.</p><p><i>It will be,</i> Rio screamed inside of her own head, <i>if you stay.</i></p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The stillness, the silence, it was thick and heavy as Agatha sat bolt upright in bed, her eyes darting around in the dark of the apartment. Her chest was heaving, her mind spinning, trying to integrate herself into the reality of where she was.</p><p>She was in that apartment, alone.</p><p>Her eyes closed for a moment as she pressed a hand to her face, the tides of sleep slowly beginning to ebb out as she became more alert. Her gaze swept to the clock on her nightstand, the empty glass of whiskey sitting next to it.</p><p>It was only 3:45.</p><p>She exhaled a soft groan, her eyes lifting to look out the window at the inky night sky, the moon hanging, just a sliver as if it had been placed directly in her purview. She wanted to go back, to even twelve hours ago. She wanted to rewind time and live every painstaking moment over again. She'd had her family, however brief, and then it had all come shattering down around her, as she had known it would.</p><p>
  <i>Her grip had never once eased on the woman in her arms. Rio's body trembled like that for minutes, and Agatha was beginning to worry that this was worse than maybe she had ever anticipated it could be. This was the right thing to do, yes, but she could see how badly it was wounding her ex-wife.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She hadn't pried, hadn't tried pull it out of her. Instead, she had just let her cry. It had never elevated, just stayed at a soft and steady weeping.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Each shaky breath, it did something to Agatha. It cut her open, from head to toe, bleeding her dry. She knew why Rio was crying, she knew that she was suffocating under the sudden weight of responsibility that life had thrust onto her shoulders. She knew she missed Nicky, that she wished he was there to experience the light of having Delilah around with them.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Agatha did too.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>The longer she spent there, the more in shock she was that Rio had not shoved her away, made her sit there and watch as she completely dissolved. She was shocked that she was allowed to be supportive, when she never had been able to be before. She didn't want to let the moment go, but before she could catch up, she felt Rio stiffen the slightest bit in her grasp.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She lifted her head, glancing down at the crown of Rio's. She wanted to place a soft kiss there, but she was not looking for a fight. Instead, she began to loosen her hold on the other woman.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>It had been her full intention to let her go.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Rio's hand on her arm had been instant, the grip there tight and commanding. She wasn't ready yet. She wasn't ready to be cold and alone. And so, Agatha did what she did best: She went into problem-solving mode. She stayed, her arms there snugly around Rio's middle, for a long few moments. It was agonizing, heart-wrenching in all the worst ways to just sit there and do what little she could when she knew it wasn't enough.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Slowly, her hold loosened and when Rio began to protest, Agatha shushed her softly. She let her go and stood at full height, but her movements were instant, leaving no room for question. She placed a hand on the arm of the chair and turned it gently until Rio was facing her. She lifted that hand, as if asking, begging for Rio to just take it, and not question her.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>The other woman's dark hunter gaze swept down, lingering on each of Agatha's long, thin fingers. Her hesitation was palpable, but Agatha was silently willing her to just reach out, to just place her hand in her own so that she could try to mend what she could.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>And finally, it happened.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>The brush of their fingers, of their palms, was so gentle, so forlorn. It was so memorialized by their separation, an official announcement of its physical end.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She pulled Rio gently to her feet and laced their fingers together, slowly guiding her, by memory, out into the living room. She stopped them in front of the couch and glanced down at it, before her eyes fell into Rio's again. The woman seemed to understand her request and placed herself so delicately onto the cushions of the couch, and Agatha took the seat next to her.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>They sat, side by side, facing forward, hands in their laps. There was a thick, miserably awkward tension that sat between them, Rio's soft sniffles echoing off the walls. Well, Agatha had gotten them there, but she was staring at so many paths, she was overwhelmed with the sheer amount of choice.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She could easily sense that they were both clamoring for a way to fill the silence, but it was still heavy and fraught with so many unspoken emotions.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Another couple of minutes of deafening quiet passed between them, and Agatha had finally lost her nerve.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Is there anything else you need before I go?" she posed, looking over at Rio.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>For a moment, Rio sat stalk still and Agatha briefly questioned if she was asleep with her eyes open, but her breathing was a little too quick for that to be true. Slowly, Rio's head turned and their eyes met across the small space of the couch.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>There was something there, for just one brief moment. It was a flashing of something. And there it was again. Rio's expression was placid, but her eyes were giving her away. There was a silent plea, one that Agatha knew Rio would never form into words for her to hear. And in that moment, Agatha had hope. She was quiet, waiting patiently for a response, growing more and more convinced that Rio might ask her to stay.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>And then she spoke.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"No, I'm okay. Thank you."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>That rough, rugged tone had evaporated, and left in its wake was depressing exhaustion. There was no hint of annoyance, no trace that she was upset or felt like Agatha was intruding. Instead, it was just the pure, raw sound... of defeat.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>A moment passed between them, almost visible in its temptation. It compelled Agatha to reach out, to cup the tender flesh of Rio's cheek in her palm, to tell her over and over again that it was going to be alright, that they were going to get through this.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She sat stalk still, though, her hands kept to herself within the confines of her restraint.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Another moment, another struggle. This one, Agatha lost.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"I suppose I should go," she managed, though it was severely lacking in any intentional conviction. She didn't want to leave. She wanted to stay. She wanted to sit there until Rio had enough of her and kicked her out again.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Rio's eyes lifted again, sweeping over to Agatha, and there was something new that registered on her face.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>That, Agatha knew, was fear.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Those eyes, those beautiful dark eyes. They rooted her to the spot; she had wanted to follow through with immediate action, but those eyes anchored her, keeping her from mooring too far out into the bay. They reached into the depths of her essence as a human, a woman, a mother, a former lover. They poked, prodded, squeezed at every inch of the humanity she had been able to keep intact over the last year.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Say it! she wanted to yell, but she bit it back.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>All Rio had to do was ask.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>The moment hung, pulled tight with tension, and then it snapped.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Okay. If you... want to come over tomorrow, just text me."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Agatha exhaled the breath she did not realize she had been holding, fighting to keep the sting of disappointment from flashing across her expression. That one hurt, there was no lying to herself about it. She felt like she was choking, but she forced herself to maintain composure. She forced herself to remember that this was not her home. Rio was not her wife.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She did not belong there.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>She offered a tight curve of her lips, something meant to be an understanding smile, and rose to her feet. "If you need anything, just call, okay?"</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Rio's eyes had been following her, and as Agatha turned around to face them again, her stomach squeezed. This was painful.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>This hurt.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Rio gave a gentle nod.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Goodnight Agatha."</i>
</p><p>It was some sick recap of the entire day, just playing on repeat inside of her head. She hated this. She hated every moment of it. She hated that she was sitting in that bed, sweat drenched and alone with her misery. She hated that she hadn't asked to stay. She hated that Rio hadn't asked her to stay, though she knew it was also an unfair accusation to sling around. The onus was not on Rio in this scenario, and that was something Agatha was painfully aware of.</p><p>She should have presented the offer, should have at least made it available. She hadn't though.</p><p>She was a coward.</p><p>She would always be a coward.</p><p>Agatha leaned back, trying her best to nestle back into the pillows, but try as she might, she could not get comfortable. She stirred and tossed, turned and fussed atop the mattress, a growing frustration beginning to boil in her chest. She just wanted to sleep. She wanted to stop thinking about the day before, wanted to stop seeing that look in Rio's eyes every time she closed her own.</p><p>Rio wasn't ever going to love her again, but Agatha wondered if that meant she wouldn't need her, at some point, either. That look, that burning gaze had almost been enough of a cry for help, a beg for attention, but without Rio verbalizing, Agatha was never going to cross that line. She was not going to push when she knew that the only result would be wounding one of the two people she now cared about in the world.</p><p>The restlessness had not faded, and at 5am, Agatha was still wide awake, staring at the ceiling.</p><p>And then, like a bolt of lighting, her phone screen lit up the room a half of a second before it began to ring, Rio's name clear as day across it.</p><p>Agatha couldn't move fast enough, lunging over to scoop the phone off of the nightstand, sliding the button to answer it.</p><p>"Hello?" her voice came, soft and rich, but alert.</p><p>"You're awake?' The sound of Rio's tones were tight and tired, like she hadn't slept all night.</p><p>"Yeah," Agatha responded gently. "I don't sleep much anymore." She paused, a soft breath of curiosity passing through her lips. "But why are you?"</p><p>It was a bit of a loaded question, and truth be told, Agatha already knew the answer.</p><p>Rio, instead, let the silence indicative of her hesitance fall between them on the line. Her lips worried together, and the truth finally came out.</p><p><i>"I haven't slept,"</i> she admitted. <i>"I just got her to stop screaming ten minutes ago."</i></p><p>Agatha's heart completely disintegrated in that moment.</p><p>She could hear the struggle, the desperation, the exhaustion wrapped around every syllable the other woman spoke like a constrictor, squeezing the life out of every word. It was devastating to hear, and even harder to imagine that they sat, twenty minutes between them, and there wasn't really much of anything Agatha could immediately do.</p><p>Her throat bobbed as she forced herself to swallow down the weight of the words that wanted to spring from her lips. She was quiet, thinking, calculating, trying to pinpoint what the easiest route to take here would be.</p><p>The thoughts were like rapid fire, pinging off the walls of her skull. She was racing, searching, and turning up nothing in her quest.</p><p>She had not realized just how long she had been silently scouring the depths of her mind for a solution when Rio spoke.</p><p>"Agatha?"</p><p>Agatha blinked, and before she could give it even a second of thought, the words began to spill out, tumbling from her lips in a rushed, soft flurry of request.</p><p>"Let me come over," she managed, though the squeeze in her words indicated that she was verging on the edge of begging.</p><p>"Agatha..."</p><p>"Rio, don't. You need to sleep. My guess is you didn't do much of it the night before, either."</p><p>At this, she could almost hear the dry twisting of the other woman's lips. Agatha had hit the mark, no hesitation, and Rio hated it. Agatha knew her. And she would always hate it.</p><p>
  <i>"Okay."</i>
</p><p>The one word, it was a celebration cannon, sounding loud and booming as Agatha heard it, despite the fact that Rio had let it go in the most exhausted, worn sigh, soft and quiet in its delivery.</p><p>"Let me get dressed and I'll come straight over. Do you need anything?"</p><p>Rio's throat squeezed and Agatha could tell by the way her breath hitched. The last time Agatha had asked her that question, it had been a year ago, and all she had wanted was Agatha and Nicky to come home.</p><p>All she had wanted, then, was Agatha there with her.</p><p>In that moment, though? She had absolutely no clue what she wanted. Of course she needed Agatha there if she had any hopes at catching any sleep, but what did she want?</p><p>"The spare key is in the box under the chair arm. I'll be in the nursery."</p><p>Agatha was speaking before she'd had any time to actually think.</p><p>"Okay, Rio. I l--" Her breath hitched hard in her throat as she caught herself. Gods, it had been so fucking easy to almost slip, to almost wreck every bit of the rapport she had been building with Rio in an attempt to mend the bridge that had been scorched between them.</p><p>"I'll be there soon," she corrected with a quickness, clearing her throat.</p><p>"See you then."</p><p>The dull hum of her words, it pulled at those broken pieces in Agatha's chest as she dropped the phone, the line clicking off. Her eyes lifted to the ceiling, the immediate swelling of emotion causing stinging pricks at the backs of them. She didn't want to shed tears over this, didn't want to admit to herself that she was too weak to not let the weight of what was happening affect her. She didn't want to break down, simply for the fact that she had no idea how, if she did, she would find it in her to pick herself back up.</p><p>With a gentle urgency, she removed herself from bed and dressed in a pair of sweatpants and a purple hoodie that hugged her frame warmly. She ran a hand through her hair as she plucked her keys out of the bowl that they were often housed in, the slight tremble still in her fingers.</p><p>What was she doing? Why did she think that going to Rio's at five in the morning was anywhere near a sane idea? Why couldn't she keep the distance?</p><p>More importantly: Why couldn't Rio?</p><p>A deflated sigh passed through her lips and she put her car into reverse, backing down the driveway to begin the short drive to her ex-wife's home.</p><p>-----------------------</p><p>The line clicked dead and Rio's head hung, her forehead pressing to the corner of her phone as she held it up. She knew she shouldn't have made the call. Yes, Agatha had offered to be that lifeline, but this was a dangerous line they were walking and Rio was far too aware that she was coming closer and closer to losing her balance.</p><p>Sure, this had been an automatic reaction, something she knew she had to do, but she never could have anticipated the emotional ramifications that it was going to have on her. She hadn't stopped to think that maybe she wasn't ready. Did that matter though? This wasn't really about her, or about Agatha, or even about them as a pair, really. This was about that baby girl, and what the best thing for her well being was going to be.</p><p>She had to put aside her own feelings to realize that admitting she needed help was going to be the only way to get through this. She knew that she couldn't call Wanda at this hour of the morning in a desperate search for backup, but Agatha? She had known before she had even dialed that Agatha would always answer.</p><p>She took a beat, listening to the sounds of nothing, the utter silence that rested deeply within the home. She knew it was likely to be short lived, but she savored it for the brief moment she had it.</p><p>This was going to be a battle, one she had nowhere near been prepared for, but Rio wasn't someone who conceded easily. She was headstrong and stubborn and had a drive and determination that were nearly unmatched. She wasn't going to let this fall apart. No, this was going to work one way or another, no matter how much sleep she got in the process.</p><p>Light footsteps carried her back up the stairs and into the nursery, her eyes falling to the crib where Delilah lay, sound asleep. A sigh of relief slipped from her lungs and she paced over, placing herself in the rocking chair. Her head turned, her gaze staying steady on the little girl through the gaps between the slats of the crib.</p><p>She was a wonder, wholly and truly. She was beautiful, she was light, she was hope.</p><p>Rio's eyes were fixed, but heavy as she rocked back and forth, and then --</p><p>
  <i>"Hey."</i>
</p><p>Rio jerked, eyes flying open and searching around wildly in the dark, though she didn't have to look too hard. Agatha was there, about a foot in front of her.</p><p>Shit, she had dozed off.</p><p>"Go on," Agatha prodded softly, tilting her head toward the direction of Rio's bedroom. "Go get some sleep. I've got this for now," she assured her, the most gentle curve of her lips appearing on her features there in the light of the moon.</p><p>Rio watched her for a moment, a silent hesitance flickering across her eyes. Was she sure? Did she really want to do this? Why was she even there? What had Rio given her in the last year that compelled her to want to show up?</p><p><i>"Go,"</i> Agatha breathed.</p><p>Rio's gaze flickered with a silent thanks as she got to her feet, trading out spaces with Agatha. She turned back, watching as the woman took up the space in the rocking chair, her body easing into it.</p><p>
  <i>"Thank you, Agatha."</i>
</p><p>Agatha waved a gentle hand in her direction, mildly dismissive, but Rio understood it.</p><p>Agatha's soft gaze watched as Rio crossed the threshold of the room and turned to the right, disappearing down the hallway, something pulling at her middle.</p><p>She hated this.</p><p>She hated that she couldn't just pick up the baby monitor and walk down that hallway and crawl into bed next to the woman she knew she would love until she died. She hated that she had to sit there, completely heeding to the call for restraint when she just wanted to make it better. She just wanted to fix what she could, even if Rio thought the situation was broken beyond repair.</p><p>She sat, and she stewed.</p><p>There was a fuss, about two hours in, and Agatha was quick in tending to it. She got her up, got her changed, and prepped a bottle. Twenty minutes had passed by the time Delilah was fed and back asleep, her chest rising and falling with an even cadence of slumber.</p><p>Another ten minutes and Agatha had started to feel restless. Something in her was shifting, tugging, pulling at her. It was that same force she had felt earlier. Her eyes were trained on Delilah's face, but they lifted, peering out into the hallway.</p><p>She was so close, and yet, it felt like Rio was miles away.</p><p>The war had begun, waging inside of Agatha like it was a battle for the ages. She wanted to, but she knew she shouldn't. She was upset with herself; her plan in getting Rio on that couch had been to soothe her, to ease her load, to make it better somehow, and she had managed to fail spectacularly at that. She had managed, instead, to drive home the fact that there was so much silence and space between them.</p><p>The twitching in her muscles had started, but she was doing everything she could to ignore it, to simply act like it wasn't happening. She didn't want to acknowledge that even her body was betraying her.</p><p>She didn't want to give in, but she could feel it getting stronger.</p><p>She managed to hold out for another fifteen minutes, but finally, that tug had won out. She could no longer just sit there and ignore it.</p><p>Slowly, steadily, and with extreme caution, Agatha got to her feet and grabbed the monitor before she shuffled out, making that turn toward the end of the hallway where Rio's bedroom was. She was quiet as she floated down the hall, stopping at the door, which was cracked by about ten inches.</p><p>An unsteady hand raised, her fingertips brushing ever so slightly over the wood before she mustered the courage to push it open.</p><p>There, in the middle of the bed, buried under a duvet, was the love of her life. She wasn't sure if she was asleep, but if she wasn't? The struggle she was enduring had to be insurmountable. Without a sound, she padded forward into the room until she reached the edge of the bed, the sharp grip of apprehension suddenly tightening around her throat. What was she doing? She needed to stop herself from making a colossal mistake, but as she stared down at Rio's form hidden beneath that blanket, something tugged her even closer.</p><p>Her knees hit the bed, the weight of it sinking beneath her. She moved, slowly and carefully, to place herself on her side behind Rio's form. The other woman did not move or stir, and so something in Agatha decided to take it a step further, perhaps out of her own deeply rooted selfishness. She lifted an arm, draping it around Rio as she pressed her face into the portion of the duvet that blanketed her back.</p><p>The room was still, the air unmoving around them. The silence was palpable, but it didn't bother Agatha, not this time.</p><p>She had just started to doze but was pulled back to alertness by a gentle shifting in her arms. Rio was moving, and Agatha's heart was aching, knowing that she was probably not going to be happy with the choice Agatha had made.</p><p>She moved more and Agatha relinquished her hold, lifting her arm up so that Rio could pull away. But instead?</p><p>Rio shifted, moving to roll to her back, and then to her opposing side, leaving their eyes staring into one another, and their faces a breath apart.</p><p>Agatha froze. What was happening? Why wasn't Rio yelling? Hitting her? Telling her that this had majorly crossed a line she should not have ever dared to cross?</p><p>There was this snag in time, for those few moments, as they simply stared at one another, having the most deafening conversation without a single word. It was this exchange of understanding, of heartache, of pain and separation. It was a statement that they both clearly understood: None of this made sense and absolutely none of it was fair.</p><p>That unyielding silence stretched over them for a long few minutes, and just as Agatha was sure that she was about to doze off to sleep, she felt it -- the lightest of touches, like the brush of a feather against her cheek.</p><p>Her eyes slid open sleepily and all at once, the realization hit her.</p><p>Rio was touching her, caressing her cheek in a way so unfamiliar to her that it could have made her sick. Her eyes were locked in those dark green pools, losing herself at an accelerated pace in the familiarity they had to offer.</p><p>It all happened in slow motion.</p><p>Rio's eyes flickered down, a vulnerable brokenness clear in them, and then back up. She pulled in a breath, but she didn't exhale it, her chest still taught with how full her lungs were. Her fingertips began to glide over the smooth skin of Agatha's cheek, sliding back toward her ear, her hairline. The palm of Rio's hand pressed flat against her cheek and the rest of her began to move. Agatha was stuck, stilled by the shock of what she perceived was happening.</p><p>Her perception, it seemed, was not that far off.</p><p>The movement didn't stop; Rio kept coming, sealing off the space that had been lingering between them, in more than one sense. She hesitated, less than a few centimeters away from Agatha's face, her thumb mindlessly brushing at Agatha's cheekbone. Her eyes were closed, she wasn't looking at Agatha anymore, but Agatha could feel it. This wasn't a show of love, this was an attempt to stop the hemorrhaging of emotion that was bleeding her out at an astonishing rate.</p><p>Another soft breath fell between them, and suddenly, the distance was gone. Rio crossed that little bit of extra space, sealing it by placing her lips firm and flush against Agatha's.</p><p>Agatha's heart stuttered in her chest, skipping more than a couple of measured beats, but she didn't fight it, didn't resist. Instead, she nearly melted into the other woman. Her own hand landed innocently on Rio's side, their lips moving together in gentle harmony, a kiss filled with longing and distance. It was a kiss filled with every unspoken word that had fallen between them for a year.</p><p>It seemed to last for an eternity, and yet not nearly long enough.</p><p>Agatha quickly took to cataloging everything she could about the moment; the way Rio's fingertips felt on her skin, the way her lips tasted salty, like the tears she had been crying, the way her touch flexed into the curve of her cheekbone the longer they kissed. She wanted to lock it away, to hold onto that feeling forever, and then it drew to a close. They separated, their breaths mixing together between them like the steam in a sauna, hot and damp.</p><p>Slowly, lids pulled open to reveal those soft blue eyes, and Agatha found herself staring at Rio in wonder, though that little pang of distance still flickered briefly inside of her.</p><p>They just gazed, back and forth, at one another, trying to unravel the meaning of what had just happened. It had been Rio's choice, Agatha told herself. She'd picked that moment to make that move. And Agatha had let her.</p><p>Though there was no sound, no noise that would flag a disturbance, Agatha's head lifted and she glanced toward the door.</p><p><i>"I should... go check on her,"</i> she managed, though her tone betrayed her; she didn't want to go.</p><p>There was this bolt of panic that flashed over Rio's features, and Agatha didn't miss the way her hand twitched, as if holding a debate on whether or not she should try to physically hold on.</p><p><i>"Stay,"</i> she breathed, a rush of anxiety wrapping firmly over her tone. "<i>Just five more minutes."</i></p><p>Shattered. Agatha was completely shattered.</p><p><i>"Five more minutes,"</i> she agreed, the tears that welled in her eyes spilling out the corners of them.</p><p>
  <i>"Just five more."</i>

    <b>2003.</b>

</p><p>
  <i>
    <b>21 years ago.</b>
  </i>
</p><p>There was just the slightest push of a rustling breeze that blew through the yellowing leaves of the trees that lined the main walkway of the entire college campus that Rio was about to spend memorizing for the next few years. It was a sight to behold, the landscaping, the architecture. This was what it looked like, the beginning of the next chapter of her life.</p><p>Or, rather, it was just a glimpse.</p><p>Getting in on a volleyball scholarship had been easy. What had been difficult had been the entire length of her senior year of high school as she waited, painstakingly, until the day she was able to leave high school behind and move in with her best friend. It had been something they had been planning since practically two days after they had met at the varsity and junior varsity joint banquet.</p><p>She could still see it in her mind's eye, the way Agatha had sauntered over to her, to compliment her on how well she played. She had been watching? Rio had simply pushed it off; she knew she was good, but it felt good to hear someone else, someone who was just as good, acknowledge it.</p><p>They had spent the next two years, until Agatha graduated, falling into something they both would have insisted was platonic. They spent the majority of the week together after school, slept over on weekends. They went to the movies, went shopping. They went for night drives in the country, passing a joint between them over the center console of the car. They sat on Agatha's roof, watching the stars, talking about anything and everything that seemed to tickle their brains.</p><p>Agatha had quickly become Rio's best friend.</p><p>Rio, however, had severely underestimated the impact that their bond had formed on her. She had known that when the summer of her junior year came to a close, she would be walking back into that school alone, without the one person who made any day worth a shit. Facing that last year, it was agonizing. Sure, they called and talked, and sometimes Agatha would come home on a weekend so that they could hang out.</p><p>Watching her leave, though, had become the bane of Rio's existence.</p><p>There was always this dull ache of loneliness, of wishing that things were different, that she could graduate sooner, somehow, so that they could be closer.</p><p>It wasn't something that had always been at the forefront of her mind, moving out as soon as she was able, but there was a thread, a connection that propelled her to want to just be near the other woman. Even in the beginning, she had begun to build the idea of getting her own place, of living down the street from her best friend. It had been her solid intention of choosing that path to live her life.</p><p>Agatha? Agatha had been brewing other plans.</p><p>At Rio's graduation party, Agatha had bounced up to her, an unabashed grin seeming to take over her entire face.</p><p>"What's that shit eating grin about?" Rio had inquired, but Agatha's hands hung, together, in front of her, clearly holding something. Rio's eyes dipped, then lifted again, the interrogation stewing in them. Before she could press, though, Agatha lifted a hand.</p><p>There, dangling from her fingers, was a ring with a key hanging off of it.</p><p>Her gaze, confused, lifted to take Agatha in, who was still wearing that ear to ear, face splitting smile.</p><p>"And what is that a key to?" Rio posed, still clearly confused.</p><p>"Our apartment. That you are going to move into with little to no protest because I've already cleared out the spare room so that you can just slide right in."</p><p>
  <i>Our apartment.</i>
</p><p>She knew it shouldn't have, but the way Agatha had said it so casually, like it was the most normal thing in the world, it sent a ripple of heat through Rio that reached the very tips of her fingers. She was moved, truly. She had planned on spending the entire summer fretting over getting the right dorm, over making sure she found one that was going to be big enough, though she knew the hope of having anything bigger than a walk in closet was not high.</p><p>Instead, she had none of that to worry about. Instead, she was getting what she wanted. She got to be closer to the only person in the world, she felt, that had ever really seen her.</p><p>The moving process had been easy; she hadn't had much to bring, but they had managed to crush it out in a few hours. At the completion of their task, they had popped open a bottle of wine and spent the rest of the night relaxing.</p><p>And so, it had become the new normal. They woke up most mornings around the same time, exchanged pleasantries over the rush of gathering coffee and needed items for class, and went about their day. After her classes when she didn't have practice, Rio worked a couple of hours each night at the campus bookstore, just to keep a bit of change in her pockets, and it knocked a bit of money off of her tuition.</p><p>She came home, night after night, to Agatha on the couch, the smell of a warm meal hanging in the air. More often than not, an empty wine glass set next to a half full bottle, an open invitation. They would watch television, gossip, do homework all while less than a foot from one another.</p><p>Rio was ignoring it. It had worked since her sophomore year of high school, hadn't it? She just ignored that feeling, that undeniable attraction she felt when she looked over at the woman that was so often by her side. She shoved those feelings away because of the sole fact that, even if they were valid? The likelihood that Agatha would at all be anywhere near such a wavelength was laughable. They were best friends. That was what worked best for them.</p><p>Or, it had been.</p><p>Until that night.</p><p>It was cool out; they had the windows open and there was a soft brush of wind that would breeze through occasionally, rustling any papers on the coffee table. It had seemed like any other night, but the smallest thing was off.</p><p>Agatha was quiet.</p><p>Too quiet.</p><p>Rio had asked a couple of times if she was alright, and she had seemed to jump back into reality to answer the question, assuring her that she was fine. After the third time, Rio had thought that maybe Agatha might at least try to act like she meant what she was saying, but it continued, humming between them in this push and pull of Rio knowing something was wrong and Agatha not letting her help.</p><p>So, Rio had turned her attention to the TV, though she couldn't actually stop herself from thinking about Agatha.</p><p>In a sudden burst of movement, Agatha lurched forward, her eyes wild. Rio stayed completely still, reading, trying to deduce what was happening.</p><p>"You okay?" she ventured, and Agatha nodded, tilting her head as she turned to behold Rio.</p><p>"I was just thinking... we haven't been on a drive in a really long time."</p><p>Rio's face lit up. "Well, let's go!"</p><p>They were on their feet in an instant, sliding on shoes as Agatha grabbed her keys. She knew there was no destination, knew that there was nowhere for them to head to, but that was part of the thrill. They were just... driving into the night, stealing away into the stars, away from the rest of the world.</p><p>The breeze that had been blowing in through the windows was more of a gust as they crossed the parking lot and climbed into the car, and even though it was dark, Rio could almost smell the rain on its way.</p><p>So they drove. Agatha knew all of the back roads by now, and she traversed them with ease, the music pumping through the speakers, the bass thumping the glass surfaces of the vehicle. The windows were down, their hair whipping wildly as they sang whatever song it was that came on the burned CD Agatha had made of some of their favorite songs.</p><p>She felt it, the faintest speck on her cheek as the rain began to trickle down in a light sprinkle. And then, the downpour came.</p><p>At first, it wasn't awful, they laughed as they rolled up the windows to keep from getting drenched, but then it got worse. It was reaching a point where, even as a passenger, Rio was getting anxious. Agatha had seemed to read those nerves and pulled off to the dirt shoulder of the country road they were on, pressing the button for her hazard lights.</p><p>"It'll pass," Agatha assured her, her gaze casting out the driver's side window, though there was not much beyond the darkness of the night as it fell over the field across the street from them.</p><p>The sounds of the radio were quiet, a little softer than the sounds of the rain on the windows, but the silence was... warm, somehow. It wasn't awkward, or uncomfortable. It just... was.</p><p>But then, for the second time that night, Agatha seemed to have an epiphany. She sat up a little straighter, glancing over to her passenger. There was this look there, like Agatha was bordering on making a wild choice, and Rio met her back with an even curiosity, waiting for her to speak.</p><p>"Let's get out," she suggested, her voice teetering on a precipice of being nervous and excited.</p><p>Rio eyed her warily, as if to ask why.</p><p>Agatha didn't shrink, though. Instead, her eyes flickered to the window, then back to Rio. "Oh, come on. Haven't you ever wanted to dance in the rain?"</p><p>This hitching of a smile pulled on Rio's features, her eyes dancing with a faint light, though there was nothing of a source, physically, to cause it.</p><p>"Okay, fine," she conceded, giggling as her hand found the door and pushed it open. A squeal emitted from her as she felt the full fury of the rain as it harpooned from the sky. Agatha left her door open and reached back in, turning up the music on the car stereo. She crossed the front of the car in a brisk walk, rushing up to catch Rio around the middle.</p><p>The two of them seemed to dissolve into laughter. This was insane. It was two in the morning and they were in the middle of a soybean field in the pouring rain.</p><p>In an instant, Rio was instead acutely aware of something. Agatha was holding her. From behind. She swore she could even feel her breath on the side of her neck.</p><p>No. No, that was not what was happening here. Rio was giving zero permission for those questions to resurface.</p><p>But then, she felt Agatha turn her, and even though she was still waging that war inside of herself, she let her arms settle atop Agatha's shoulders, draping around her neck. She was also very aware of the two places Agatha's hands had landed on her side, like they were about to initiate a slow dance at a wedding.</p><p>The rain was persistent, washing over them, drenching them. In that moment, as Rio's eyes met Agatha's across the short space between them? She felt it.</p><p>The world was gone, having melted away into molten lava at the base of the pedestal the two of them stood on. The rain still poured, and there was even a -- very -- dramatic flash of lightning above their heads. Their eyes both swept up, then back down as soft laughs came, but barely, breathed out in mystified huffs.</p><p>And then, there they were, locked in an embrace, and shuttered into a staring contest that Rio wasn't sure she knew how to lose. She wasn't sure she could be the one to buckle here. After all, she had convinced herself over and over again that any measure of Agatha's feelings would never extend beyond a rich, platonic love.</p><p>But then, she stood there, looking at Rio like that. It was almost like a predator, watching and stalking its prey, trying to decide what the reaction would be to the slightest movement. She had never looked at her in that way before, and it sparked something right in Rio's core, something she was still battling on acknowledging.</p><p>The music was still playing, but with how hard Rio's heart was beating between her ears, she couldn't hear it anymore. The tension was impossibly thick in that ten inches of space between them, but her gaze never wavered, intent on Agatha's face, trying to read her, trying to decipher what was going through that head of hers.</p><p>Before she could could part her lips to pose her question, Agatha answered it first with a delivery so smooth that it almost tricked Rio into not being completely floored.</p><p>
  <i>"I'm going to kiss you."</i>
</p><p>For a solid ten seconds, Rio just stood there, a completely struck and stupid look on her face as she blinked at her best friend. She suddenly realized that while it had been said with intent and finality, Agatha was still waiting for her permission. Slowly, and almost imperceptibly, she gave a light nod of her head.</p><p>There was a patch of cold on her side instantly, but only because Agatha had removed her hand to raise it, press it to Rio's jaw. She secured a gentle but snug hold and tugged, bringing Rio to her so that their lips could meet in an act that thoroughly shattered the tension that had been sitting heavy between them.</p><p>She felt it nowhere and everywhere all at once. It was an immediate sense of numbness, of being completely outside of her own being, and then, like a coursing shock throughout every inch of her body, Rio felt like someone had lit her on fire. She wasn't physically burning, but every bit of her that she was consciously aware of was so hot that she felt like she was never going to be able to reach a sustainable, normal body temperature again so long as she lived.</p><p>It had been a tentative kiss, at first. It was sweet, exploratory, their lips simply finding the ground of the path they needed to traverse. It was gentle, soft.</p><p>But as the rain fell down on and around them, the biome they were creating with their intensity only expanded, the heat growing. The kiss deepened, her lips folding over Agatha's in desperation, her hands having landed on either side of her neck, holding her firm and still for the easiest access.</p><p>Boldly, she parted her lips, the tip of her tongue revealing itself just enough to run a barely-there line along Agatha's bottom lip. It was an unasked question for permission. Only a second passed before she could feel Agatha open herself up, her lips parting as their tongues met in an assembly of passion that Rio suddenly understood had been brewing between them for three years.</p><p>They might as well have been a fallen star in that field with how white their presence was burning in the dark of night. The kiss continued on for minutes, and while Agatha's hands seemed restless as they moved from Rio's neck, to her hair, to her jaw, neither of them had pushed any harder.</p><p>After an eternity, and what also felt like the few blips of a few seconds, they came unstuck from one another. Agatha cradled her jaw and pressed their foreheads together and Rio wanted to be as close as Agatha was keeping her. She wanted to stay there, forever, in that storm with the world silent and asleep around them as they set off fireworks for only themselves. She wanted them to be the only two people in the world, just for a little longer.</p><p><i>"This is the part where I say something really sweet, like 'I've thought about doing that for so long,' right?"</i> Agatha murmured over the sound of thunder.</p><p>Rio's eyes crinkled at the corners with her smile, the adoration sitting heavy in the weight of her gaze as she beheld the other woman.</p><p>
  <i>"Wouldn't hurt."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"It would be a lie. It wasn't 'for so long.' It was since the the jv/varsity dinner."</i>
</p><p>Something between amusement and bewilderment flickered across Rio's face.</p><p>
  <i>"But that was the night we met."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"I know."</i>
</p><p>Rio's smile didn't wane, even as she pulled Agatha to her by a fistful of her shirt, their lips crushing again in another kiss, this one hot and sultry right off of the rip. There were no pretenses anymore, no reason to keep acting like this wasn't exactly what she had wanted, had been wanting long before she would let herself actively admit it.</p><p>It lingered on, their heavy breaths drowned out by the sound of the rain and the rolls of thunder overhead, for another few moments. Agatha was the one to pull away, though, inhaling a sharp breath, as if it was the first one she had taken in a while.</p><p>A soft giggle flittered off of Rio's lips.</p><p>
  <i>"Let's go home."</i>
</p><p>And so, they had. Soaking wet, they trudged into the apartment, the laughter still bubbling within them. There was something more, though. It was heavier, but not in that way that Rio thought it might sink her. Instead, it was a new weight, an unfamiliar one. It was thick with... possibility?</p><p>She had excused herself to get in the shower, which had only taken her a few minutes. She announced her departure from the bathroom as she made the quick exit to her bedroom so that she could change her clothes and tend to her skin. She heard the bathroom door shut as she massaged the moisturizer into her face in the mirror on her vanity. She had not, however, heard it reopen. So as she got to her feet and had the intention of making her way to the living room, she hardly thought twice as she lifted her head when she passed by Agatha's room.</p><p>She had not expected her to be in there, and she had especially not expected her to be standing at the end of her bed with her back to the door, naked from head to toe.</p><p>Rio had stilled, stuck by the sheer beauty of the sight. The soft light held her skin as if it were a valuable commodity, the smallest shadows curling around the bottoms of her shoulder blades, casting soft, gray dimness down the very tops of her thighs where the small curve of her ass blocked the light.</p><p>She sucked in a breath, completely beyond her own cognition, and this drew Agatha's attention, her head whipping around. When she caught sight of the doorway, it was empty.</p><p>When she surfaced, dressed in soft pajamas, Rio was on the couch, a bag of veggie straws open on the space of the couch that was usually reserved for snacks or alcohol. Her hunter green gaze lifted, the smile on her lips instant at the sight of the other woman, her long, thick hair pulled over one shoulder in a meticulous braid.</p><p>"So," Rio mused, biting the end off of one of the straws as she chewed thoughtfully, the remote in her other hand pointed at the television in an indication. "I recorded the new episode of Nip/Tuck, but if you can wait, we can watch the new Arrested Development that comes on in ten minutes."</p><p>She had been looking forward, but she had noticed that Agatha had not moved from where she stood beside the coffee table. Slowly, Rio's eyes lifted and the expression she was met with? It made her swallow the sudden bubble of nerves that lodged in her throat.</p><p>"So we're just going to watch TV and eat... veggie straws the rest of the night?"</p><p>Rio faltered for a moment, blinking up at her. Well, considering she had never had any kind of roadmap to navigate how something like this would work, she had thought she was holding her own.</p><p>Slowly, Rio's own expression melted into something warmer, something more... paramount.</p><p>"Oh, I'm sorry, did you have other plans?"</p><p>There was a tone of challenge there, only accompanied by a raise of her brow for emphasis.</p><p>Agatha's cutting stare never left her face as she moved, deliberately, reaching down to pull the remote from Rio's fingers. She glanced over toward the television to make sure it shut off as she pressed the button. Dropping it on the coffee table, she looked back down at Rio, those silent demands swirling around in her eyes. She held out a hand, a quietly demanding invitation.</p><p>Rio glanced at it for a moment, and then back up at Agatha's face, trying to read the moment. Was this really going where she suddenly thought it might be?</p><p>Tentatively, her own hand raised, fingertips gliding across Agatha's palm until she was snug in her grasp. She got to her feet and let Agatha pull her along, taking her straight back down the hallway and turning into her room without a moment's hesitation.</p><p>Rio had spent time in Agatha's room before. There had been drunken nights that she had fallen asleep at the foot of her bed like a loyal puppy, and there had been nights where she had held Agatha as she cried -- about partners, about her awful mother -- and there had been nights where she had stood in the doorway, watching her best friend sleep, if for no other reason than just to make sure she was okay.</p><p>Stepping into it right at that precise moment? She was in the temple of Agatha Harkness, and she suddenly never wanted to leave.</p><p>Agatha pulled her to the side of the bed that was closer to the door and gave her a tug, wordlessly instructing Rio where to go, where she wanted her. Rio obliged with little fight, turning so that the backs of her thighs were pressed to the side of the mattress, and Agatha's hungry stare probed every inch of her mind. She could feel her in there, digging, rooting around for what her next move should be.</p><p>The heat was immediate and palpable, hanging substantially around them, the tension building with every second that ticked by and they stood in that deadlock.</p><p>If Agatha would have asked her, outright asked her in that moment? If Agatha would have looked her in the eyes and asked, flat out, What do you want? she was not sure he answer would have been anything less than a request for her to throw her on that bed, rip her clothes off, and ravish her until the sun came up.</p><p>Tempered. She had to be tempered, to take this by the steps the natural progression would provide.</p><p>But <i>Jesus Christ</i> if she didn't want to lay into her right then and there.</p><p>Another moment slipped between them and realization dawned on Rio. Agatha was doing this on purpose. She was making her chase the high, chase the thrill. She was making a very clear statement that she would provide, but it had to be made apparent, what was wanted.</p><p>Agatha wasn't going to ask. She'd already gotten her permission in that field, and it had unlocked both of the padlocks on the door that they had each placed to keep their feelings locked away. Now, it was all allowed to breathe. Now, it was all allowed to blossom.</p><p>Rio watched her with hinged interest as she debated her next move. Slowly, and very deliberately, Rio raised her hands, in tandem, until her fingertips just barely brushed over the skin of Agatha's neck, taunting in their light touch. They were slow, dragging gentle trails and leaving tendrils of a blush in their wake. She didn't need to see those to know they were there. Her left palm pressed flat, flush against the side of Agatha's neck, and the right danced a little higher, fingertips moving to trace the lightest of lines along the inner ridge of Agatha's ear.</p><p>She had been perceptively focused on her own movements, but when she did that? Her attention was sucked right to the way Agatha's chest caught, her breath hitching there -- hard. <i>Aha! A crack!</i> She couldn't restrain the wicked grin that wound up her lips. Maybe Agatha was the one that initiated, but Rio was more than capable of playing ball.</p><p>She stayed close, but her touch drifted. It graced the tragus of her ear, and then shifted to only two fingers as they swept up toward the knot of her cheekbone. At this, she watched Agatha's eyes fall shut, her chest raising with the sharp breath she had drawn in. Rio's eyes were fixed on her own fingers as the moved with a purpose, though the force of their presence was merely a breath on Agatha's skin. They felled the line of her cheekbone, swiping up the curve of her nose to trace over one eyebrow, then back toward the other.</p><p>A lone fingertip ran, just barely there, down the length of Agatha's nose, the look of utter helplessness seeming to melt right beneath Rio's touch. She covered the landscape of her other cheek, the angle of her jaw to her chin, and then back up the other side. The last place she came for, her skimming graze unrelenting and unforgiving, was Agatha's lips.</p><p>This was more calculated, more precise. This was something Rio poured herself into, entirely. Two fingers rose, and she found herself holding her own breath, realizing a moment later that Agatha was doing the same thing, anticipating whatever the next touch was going to be, her eyes still shut in surrender.</p><p>It started at one corner, winding upward, taking a smooth and deliberate path over her top lip, following every curve. As it reached the distance of its length, she doubled back, taking the bottom lip this time, repeating the process.</p><p>They parted beneath her touch and a soft sound -- something between a whimper and a moan -- left Agatha's lips.</p><p>A sheeting of goosebumps dropped heavy on Rio's skin, a churning of desire beginning to form in her middle.</p><p>
  <i>Holy shit, that was hot.</i>
</p><p>Agatha had always been a beautiful human being in Rio's eyes, but in that moment? The utter sex appeal that was dripping off of her? Rio was dumbly left wondering how the hell it had taken her this long to come to her senses.</p><p>Her hand moved once more to cup Agatha's jaw, though there was more of a raw possessiveness this time. Her thumb moved down, brushing over Agatha's lips. It was almost too tender for the moment, but of course Agatha found a way to remedy that.</p><p>Her lips parted and with a quickness and she caught Rio's thumb between her teeth, applying a gentle pressure at the way Rio's eyes widened in shock.</p><p>The heat in her was instant. She didn't even care about the feeling of Agatha's teeth sinking into the pad of her thumb, not at all. All she gave two fucks about right then was that hungry look in the other woman's eyes, and the way she could feel the drum of wanting begin to pulse between her legs.</p><p>Rio pressed down, a silent request for release, and Agatha obliged, relinquishing her bite, though a primal smirk was being worn proudly on her lips.</p><p>Both hands were back on Agatha's face, securing the angle of her jaw before Rio silently ordered her closer. The kiss was crushing and hot, causing Rio's pulse to spike in every single part of her body where she could feel it, from her ankles to her neck. Their tongues were tangling, warring, battling for who was going to gain the upper hand, here. Her grip was firm as she held Agatha where she wanted her, kissing her like there was nothing else in the world to ever be done. This was her duty, her mission, and she had dedicated herself entirely.</p><p>Their lips broke apart, but only as Agatha's arm snaked around her waist, her weight leaning into her. Rio understood the silent instruction and heeded, moving to lay back across the width of the bed, not surprised that she was met with Agatha's presence above her.</p><p>For it being such a charged moment, Rio would have had to admit that she was a bit stunned by the way the predatory and insatiable shine was momentarily gone from Agatha's eyes, and instead, it was replaced by... was that tenderness? Was that affection, or adoration? It wasn't identifiable in its entirety, but it was something that was notably softer than the starving stare she had been getting half the night.</p><p>One of Agatha's hands moved up, a fingertip tracing so softly along Rio's hairline, pushing her hair back, though it didn't take much effort with how she was laying. It was more the act of doing so than what it actually accomplished, anyway.</p><p>The moment wore on, a certain reverence falling around them. A gentle playfulness came over Rio, though, and she found herself speaking.</p><p><i>"How's the view?"</i> she posed in a hushed whisper.</p><p>A little smile tugged at Agatha's lips, and that softness remained for just a second longer, and then -- just like that -- it was replaced with that familiar hunger.</p><p><i>"It's nice,"</i> she breathed, her voice low, gravelly and husky in its presentation. <i>"But I might be able to come up with a few more I'd prefer. Do you think you can help me?"</i></p><p>There was a clear deliverance of mischief there in her words, and Rio was willing to bite.</p><p>
  <i>"I think I can manage that. What sight would you like to see first?"</i>
</p><p>As if already knowing what her answer would be, Rio felt Agatha's knees squeeze, locking tight around her hips. In one fluid moment, she rolled over, using the leverage to pull Rio on top of her, eliciting a soft gasp, followed by a wicked grin.</p><p><i>"Mmm," </i>Agatha hummed, clearly pleased with herself. <i>"That's a start."</i></p><p>Rio was still wearing that grin, though she rolled her eyes just before she leaned in, her hand firmly taking hold of Agatha's chin as she closed the distance between them with a hot and hard kiss.</p><p>Breath. Teeth. Moans. Gasps. Hisses. Sighs.</p><p>It went on like that for several moments. Rio, for one, was using the time to build her nerve, though if it was constructing as quickly as the burning passion inside of her was, it wouldn't take much longer.</p><p>Each time she felt the reverberations of Agatha's soft moans or grunts on her own teeth, she could feel her own hold slipping. This was inevitable, wasn't it? Surely so, but she was also aware of something: Agatha was leaving this on her terms. Every step forward, she wanted Rio to be the one guiding them.</p><p>Somewhere, beneath the heat and the welling of desire, a gentle appreciation nestled within her.</p><p>It was a subconscious thing, because her full conscious? It was dedicated to right there, right then. She was six seasons deep in the drama of Agatha Harkness and she wanted nothing more than continue her binge.</p><p>Finally, she pulled away for air, but she was emboldened for a moment that was long enough for her to prove her nerve. She tucked her head in the crook of Agatha's neck, her lips brushing softly over the skin there in a light caress. She peppered light kisses up the side of it to her ear, an occasional skimming of teeth being the only interruption.</p><p>As she reached the lobe of Agatha's ear, her teeth latched onto it gingerly, giving a gentle tug. Instantaneously, she could feel Agatha's fingers curl into the back of her ribcage, shortly followed by a breathy gasp.</p><p><i>"Rio,"</i> came a low growl from Agatha, some poor attempt at a scolding, though Rio could tell her task had been accomplished well enough that it wasn't genuine in its delivery.</p><p>In challenge, Rio pressed her lips to Agatha's ear, letting out a very deliberate and intentionally worked up sigh, right into it.</p><p><i>"Rioooo," </i>Agatha whined, this time. Gone was the sharp edge her first beckoning had wrought and it was instead replaced with the tones of a plea, something that brought a strong sense of satisfaction to Rio.</p><p>Her hands began a trek, primed and ready for a venture, and any dips or curve they might experience. The traveled with intent, reverent in their touch as fingertips felled over the skin of Agatha's chest, lifting by no other choice at the neck of her shirt. The liftoff was brief, and the landing on the fabric of her shirt was immediate. Both hands met on her sides, only made possible by the way Rio had shifted to straddle her.</p><p>That touch delved deeper, lower, until she had reached the hem of Agatha's shirt, and with a deft cunning, they slipped beneath, meeting warm and soft skin.</p><p>Agatha drew in another sharp breath, though her eyes slid shut and she hummed a delighted response.</p><p>She could have drawn it out even longer than she already wanted, but that little sound had been enough to hurry Rio's brain along. She wanted to see what she was touching.</p><p>She palmed the hem of the shirt and gave a light tug as she leaned back, prompting Agatha to lift off the bed so Rio could pull the shirt over her head, haphazardly discarding it to the side as she turned back with an eager anticipation.</p><p>What she saw?</p><p>Agatha's chin was tilted up toward her, that hair flowing down her bare back. Rio's eyes dropped, craving, consuming.</p><p>She took in every curve of Agatha's breasts, the way her nipples were at attention from arousal, every divot of muscle that rippled through her form. She was truly a sight to behold, and while Rio had been convinced she could never get her fill before?</p><p>Turning into a glutton over Agatha didn't seem like the world's worst idea.</p><p>Rio licked her lips, realizing that her mouth was suddenly bone dry. She faltered just a moment, but before she could make any move, she felt Agatha's hands on her skin, beneath her shirt, warm and firm. She gave the smallest nod, not waiting for Agatha to ask for permission. In an instant, her shirt was drifting to the floor, surely to land somewhere near Agatha's.</p><p>Rio had never been a fan of religion, but as she tilted her head down to meet Agatha's wanting gaze?</p><p>She knew, right then, what it felt like to be worshipped.</p><p>The look in her eyes was more than hunger, more than want. The longer Rio took it in, she could see as it teetered on the edge of lust and desperation.</p><p><i>"I've always known you were beautiful," </i>Agatha divulged in a low hum, leaning forward the slightest bit to place a kiss directly between Rio's breasts. <i>"But Jesus fuck. You are so <b>hot.</b>"</i></p><p>The words, as she said them and breathed them into the skin of her sternum, seared right into the essence of who Rio was, completely engulfing her in flames. She was, without a question, on fire.</p><p>She had no witty retort, had no sly comment to make back.</p><p>Her response was the grip she took on Agatha's face, steady and strong. She peered into her, looking into those beautiful blue windows, looking for everything she had been missing over the course of their friendship. This could have been theirs sooner, if she would have known.</p><p>There was no use dwelling, though, not when she was planted concretely in Agatha's lap.</p><p>The kiss she stole was demanding, possessive. It was full of an intense passion that was nearly searing itself out of her and into Agatha with minimal effort. Somewhere in the process, she had missed the way Agatha's arm snaked around the small of her back, hooking on the other side of the way. This only became important when, with a startling ease, Agatha pulled at her, shifting their weight so that she could pin Rio to the bed, an arm sliding down to hold Rio's leg firmly where it was.</p><p>While the kiss had remained intact, it was broken suddenly a moment later as Rio's head jerked back, a gasp filling the air at the way Agatha's hips shifted down into hers, the pressure intentional.</p><p>Agatha's hand was moving, feeling out the form of Rio's waist, her hip, lifting to only the touch of fingertips as she reached Rio's thigh. Her lips pressed in measured determination at Rio's neck, intentional in their hesitance with each kiss, her lips lingering on Rio's skin. She stalled, instead drawing light circles in the same spot. It had Rio panting in anticipation, her teeth sinking into her lower lip.</p><p>The tip of Agatha's finger moved, whisper light, circling inward, and then upward. There was the faintest pressure between her legs, barely there against the fabric of her shorts, but just enough to be noticed. She bit down harder, an echo of a whimper sounding from somewhere low in her throat.</p><p>Agatha could almost hear Rio's pulse pounding in her neck, and she could certainly feel it as her lips brushed over her throat.</p><p>Okay, the time for games was over.</p><p>Agatha adjusted slightly, lifting herself to her knees so that she had full mobility of her hands. Her fingers raked light lines down Rio's torso, that ferocious hunger written all over her face. As they reached her hips, she hooked the waist of her shorts and underwear in one fell swoop and pulled them down. She moved accordingly and once she was able to discard them with the other items of forgotten clothing, her gaze swept back down to the woman laying on the bed at her knees.</p><p>
  <i>Goddamn, what a view.</i>
</p><p>Rio could see the pensive assessment written on Agatha's face in the dark of the room. She was committing it to memory, the sight she saw there. She could literally feel every single spot Agatha's ravenous gaze touched on her body, and it caused a thin sheen of sweat to bead on her skin. She had never felt so open, so vulnerable, so... well, naked.</p><p>Agatha leaned over her, the sheer power of her abdominal muscles holding her above Rio, that look still plastered to her face.</p><p>The kiss she offered was still hot, but it was... different. It was an introduction, a handholding for what was coming.</p><p>Rio was acutely in tune with everywhere Agatha's hands roamed on her bare body. She touched her neck, felt out the muscles of her arm, traced teasing lines over her breast, deliberately missing any contact she might have made with her nipple. She drew paths on the map of Rio's body with every touch. The destination was important, of course, but the sense of exploration seemed to exhilarate both of them.</p><p>She graced Rio's middle, her fingertips landing with authority in the center of her stomach, just above her navel. She lifted her head from Rio's neck, their eyes finding one another in the darkness, the unasked question hanging between them.</p><p>Slowly, Rio lifted a hand and reached down, wrapping it over Agatha's as she began to guide it down, lower, right where she needed it.</p><p>A worked up moan passed through her lips the moment Agatha's touch met with her damp warmth, every nerve lighting up at once.</p><p><i>"Fuck," </i>Agatha hissed lowly, but her tone was impressed. Likely, she was realizing right then the effect she had been having on Rio since they had stood in that bean field.</p><p>She applied a light pressure, a rhythmic stroking of that sensitive skin, just feeling, just exploring. Her touch would move, curious in its search to find every single spot that might make Rio come unglued. She was gauging every sharp breath, every gasp, every moan, using them to guide her, to encourage her.</p><p>Rio's hips lifted, working against the pressure to satisfy the need building in her middle, but it wasn't enough. Her hand slid between them again, thin fingers securing around Agatha's wrist, guiding her hand lower, her mind in too much of a pleasurable tangle to actually articulate what she was asking for.</p><p>Thankfully, three years of spending the majority of their time together had taught Agatha how to read Rio like a book.</p><p>She conceded, slowly pressing a finger inside of her. Rio's hand flew up, gripping tightly at Agatha's bare bicep. The sting of nails pressing into her skin was instant, but she didn't care in the least. The sounds Rio began to make as Agatha started to set a gentle pace? They nearly sent her over the edge, and she wasn't even the one being touched.</p><p>After another moment, she made a choice, this one without permission. She knew, though, that if the reaction was negative, she would deescalate immediately. Carefully, as she pulled her hand back, she dropped another finger. She pushed both back in, Rio's back immediately arching off the mattress in response as another moan filled Agatha's ears. The stirring in her middle had since reached the turbulence of a careening aircraft with its engines cut.</p><p>The way Rio was clinging to her, gripping at her, she was doing everything she could to beg for her, more of her, without actually ever having to find the words. She could feel Agatha inside of her, every twist and curl of her fingers, touching parts of her that she hadn't ever thought about anyone reaching in to find.</p><p>Her pants grew heavier and the breaths she took tapered in length but rose in pace. She could feel as the pressure there was begging for release. She wanted to let go, and with just the right curve of her touch, Rio moaned, far louder than she had before. Her body trembled with every rolling wave of the orgasm that had just smacked right into her, her legs shaking at Agatha's hips. The pleasure was pulling her under, trying to drown her in its delicious warmth and she was ready to let it.</p><p>Her eyes fluttered open and Agatha was there above her, that wicked grin easy on her expression.</p><p>Rio hid her face behind her palm, the grin on her face apparent nonetheless. She breathed a soft laugh, spreading her fingers to peer up at Agatha from between them.</p><p>The way she was watching her? It made her melt.</p><p>
  <i>"Why do I think that was only an introduction to the next... two hours?"</i>
</p><p>Amusement danced in Agatha's eyes as she blew out a puff.</p><p>
  <i>"Only two? What kind of woman do you take me for?"</i>
</p><p>The hours of the morning ticked on, overshadowed by every cry, every moan and every gasp that seemed to be in endless supply between Rio and Agatha.</p><p>There was a faint light trying to claw its way in through the blinds from the outside world, but that was of little interest to Rio as she slid off of Agatha, fitting against her side without even considering. Skin was hot, flushed, slick with sweat, but neither of them seemed to care. Rio tucked her head to lay on Agatha's chest, feeling her fingers immediately make work of running through her hair. It was a soothing feeling, one that caused her eyes to slide shut, a soft and satisfied hum passing through her lips.</p><p>Their chests were still heaving a bit, their breaths heavy in the night as they laid like that for a long few moments, seeming to just need the time to play catch-up with the last... four hours?</p><p>When the sound of her own heart seemed to calm enough to stop obscuring her hearing, a new sound filled her senses. There, beneath her ear, she could hear the faint thumping of Agatha's heart. It was steady, strong, but smooth and slow. Just barely, Rio's head lifted and she looked up at Agatha.</p><p>Gorgeous, beautiful Agatha, her eyes closed, her cheeks pink, and her lips pressed in a thin line that indicated sleep.</p><p>For that one moment, Rio had an absurd thought.</p><p>
  <i>I could spend the rest of my life with this woman.</i>

  <h2 class="heading">Bite to Break Skin</h2>


</div>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>It had started as five minutes.</p><p>Then five turned to ten. And then, ten rolled into twenty.</p><p>It had been almost forty five minutes since Rio had asked Agatha to stay, but before it could reach the hour mark, Agatha heard it. It was the soft rustling sound over the monitor, followed by the quietest little gurgle.</p><p>Agatha assessed the situation, rooting through her own head to figure out how best to do this. Her eyes fell down to Rio, who had fallen back asleep sometime shortly after their exchange. Something in Agatha couldn't help but to wonder if really, she had just been asleep the whole time. It left a bitterness in her, an annoying bite that she didn't want to pay any heed to.</p><p>Slowly, and with a great deal of care, Agatha removed herself from the bed, a little more than relieved when Rio did not stir. What had happened in that bed that morning? It had left Agatha feeling more exposed that she had ever been when she'd been in that position before. She had spend hundreds, if not thousands, of nights in that bed, and never before had she once felt so completely stripped as the moment she had when Rio kissed her.</p><p>She had thought, for so long, that if the moment ever came and Rio broke down those walls, it would feel like a victory. She had thought it might give her hope.</p><p>What Agatha stewed over as she floated down the hallway and into the nursery was that it gave her nothing.</p><p>Instead, it only seemed to take.</p><p>It took away the dream that things might reach some semblance of normalcy. It took away any chance that things could ever heal between them. Rio wasn't kissing her because she loved her, she was kissing her because it was an anesthetic. It numbed her pain. It eased the weight of the world for a few seconds at a time.</p><p>Agatha was used to using people. Her ability to develop emotional attachments had been stunted as a child, from years of abuse, and it had caused quite a bit of turmoil in her adult life. The only person who had ever seemed to accept her for the broken mess she was had been Rio. Rio had always been Agatha's soft spot, the one person that she could not bring herself to use or manipulate. She had been under some unspoken assumption that no matter what life did to them, that would always be a mutual understanding.</p><p>She had very obviously been wrong.</p><p>She didn't like it much, the feeling of being used for something that could have just been asked for. If Rio had looked her in the eyes and just told her she needed her to make her forget? It still would have shredded her, but she might have been more willing to make the concession.</p><p>Rio wouldn't ask her for a thing, that was one thing that had become painfully clear to Agatha.</p><p>She had not asked her to prep the nursery. She had not asked her to go with her to pick up Delilah. She had not asked her to be the one to quell the cries on the way home. She had not asked Agatha to stay.  She had not even asked her to come over at five in the morning, and had insisted on putting up some form of a fight, even if it had been minimal.</p><p>It was frustrating; why couldn't Rio just see that all Agatha wanted to do was just care? She just wanted to be allowed to help, to do something to ease the other woman's burden, but Rio only wanted to accept the help she thought she deserved.</p><p>She tried to understand it, tried to sort through every bit of reasoning she could so that she could make sense of it. Rio hated her. This was a known fact. Rio also knew that raising an infant at the stage they were at in life? She couldn't do it without Agatha.</p><p>The problem, Agatha was realizing, was that Rio absolutely did <i>need</i> her. That couldn't be questioned. The harsher reality was dawning on her: Rio did not <i>want her.</i></p><p>What Rio wanted was a fix, something to make it all go away for a little bit. Maybe there had been a past version of Agatha that would have caved out of spite, just to make Rio regret it, but they were too old for those kinds of games. They were long past the parts of their lives where that could have made any sense. Playing with Rio would give Agatha no satisfaction. At this point? She knew she would hurt herself more than it would ever offer any kind of resolution to the surplus of emotion that was walled within her.</p><p>Although there was minimal noise as she walked into the nursery, Agatha could immediately see that Delilah was awake. Those big emerald pools swept over the sights above her, from the mobile to the wall decorations and back again, her hand shoved in her mouth as she gummed at her fingers.</p><p>Her legs kicked at nothing and the softest coo of contentment filled the air, causing a tightening around Agatha's heart. She had been so focused on loving this child that she had not realized how difficult it might prove to be, to be allowed to do such a thing. Maybe Rio would never actually trust her again, and that was a reasonable reaction to their past, but did she really have to make all of this <i>so</i> fucking hard?</p><p>"Good morning, beautiful girl," Agatha cooed, her tone rich and warm as she leaned down to lift Delilah out of the crib, laying her against her chest. Her hand smoothed over the tiny back, the onesie wrinkles sliding along with her touch.</p><p>
  <i>Gods, what it was like to have a baby in her arms again.</i>
</p><p>Agatha knew that for the most part, she had been keeping the volume on the majority of her emotions at a minimum. She knew she could not run the risk of letting herself feel the full extent of everything she that was just begging, waiting for the opportunity to drag her under. She couldn't let it; she had purpose now.</p><p>For so long, she had been convinced that sense of purpose would only come from making Rio forgive her, but realized now that it had been a foolish way of operating.</p><p>Delilah was her purpose now. She had a duty to care for her, and love her. Rio might not ever love her again, but Delilah? She had an entire lifetime to be loved, and learn how to give it back.</p><p>Maybe it was selfish, hoping for that unconditional feeling, but she couldn't help it. Since she had walked out (read: been pushed) of Rio's life a year ago, Agatha had been painstakingly alone. Silence had become her most frequently played soundtrack and more often than not, she hardly knew what to do with herself outside of drinking enough whiskey to push her into slumber.</p><p>Looking down into that adorably chubby face, though? It gave her something worth waking up for. It gave her something to look forward to. Sure, the scope of her involvement was still pretty up in the air with the cold shoulder Rio had been giving for the majority of their time in the same room, but there was still hope that she could make it around as much as possible. As much as Rio would let her.</p><p>
  <i>"You are my sunshine, my only sunshine."</i>
</p><p>The singing that fell from Agatha's lips was nothing more than a hushed murmur, a gentle greeting to the day.</p><p>
  <i>"You make me happy, when skies are gray."</i>
</p><p>The softest chiming of a giggle bubbled just above the sound of the lyrics. Agatha's heart soared in that moment, somewhere high above her.</p><p>
  <i>"You'll never know, dear, how much I love you. Please... don't take my sunshine away."</i>
</p><p>Delilah's tiny fists waved around in delight, the giggles coming a little stronger now. Well, that had worked far better than she had thought it might. She didn't have the best voice, but she knew she was capable of singing, and apparently, it really did have a soothing quality to it.</p><p>"Let's get you changed and ready for the day. What do you think?" Agatha asked her gently, holding her up in front of her face, admiring her.</p><p>The baby gave a quiet but thrilled squeal in apparent agreement and Agatha found a truly delighted sound -- a laugh? -- slipping through her lips. It sounded foreign as it touched her ears, a sound that was too distant to be recalled in a memory.</p><p>After getting her changed and into a new outfit that had been included in the bag that had come with Delilah's arrival, she cradled the baby against her hip and carried her downstairs, beginning a routine of making her a bottle as she bounced her gently. As it spun in the center of the microwave, Agatha's eyes dropped to the empty coffee pot and the glass container next to it that looked to have some of the beans Rio had already ground left in it.</p><p>The microwave beeped and she shuffled over, pulling the bottle out as she set it on the counter and went back to the quick task of making a fresh pot of coffee. When she had pushed the button and the light flipped on, signifying the beginning of the process, she swiped up the bottle and loosened her hold on the baby just enough to flip her hand out, exposing her wrist. She applied a gentle pressure to the bottle, causing a brief stream of the formula to land on her wrist, allowing her to gauge the temperature.</p><p>She was satisfied with it and lifted her head, trying to decide on where the best place to do this was. She could go to the living room, sure, or even back to the nursery, but those earlier hours kept playing through her head on a loop.</p><p>Being inside that house was suffocating.</p><p>She turned her head, taking in the sight of the back yard, the very edge of one of the wooden rocking chairs jutting into view. This seemed to satisfy her and she headed over, pulling the door open to greet the fresh air.</p><p>She sat, settling Delilah into a comfortable position for her to eat. She lifted the bottle and pressed it to her lips, thankful that she did not seem to offer any protest. Despite the fact that she looked like she was going strong, Agatha was exhausted, and she was tired of fighting. She needed <i>some</i> sense of ease in her life.</p><p>The morning was warm, much warmer than she had thought it might be, and the sun was bright; judging by where it was in the sky, it was almost much later than she had thought.</p><p>The day was busy with the sound of birds in the trees and cars passing by on the other side of the house, but Agatha thought that it was rather calming. She sat there, Delilah in her arms, having no sense of how much time had passed. The sound of the door sliding open pulled her attention, though, and she forced a smooth expression.</p><p>Rio was not going to see her break.</p><p>-------------------------</p><p>The light of day was harsh as it poured in the two windows in Rio's bedroom, and she couldn't help it as a gentle but irritated sigh slipped through her lips. A blind hand slapped along the bed in front of her, grabbing her phone as she peered at the time.</p><p>Shit. It was two in the afternoon?</p><p>She sat up and rubbed at her face, slumping as her hand fell to her lap. Something in her pulled her gaze over her shoulder, as if she was looking for something. Something she didn't know she should have been looking for. The only thing there was a pillow, displaced from where it had been the night before, pulled down a little lower with the lightest hint of a divot in it from where a head had been resting.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>
  <i>Fuck.</i>
</p><p>It all came back in an onslaught of brief flashes, a recollection of a tired and hazy mind.</p><p>She had kissed Agatha.</p><p>
  <i>Fuck again.</i>
</p><p>She had woken up to that feeling, the feeling of being held, of being protected, and she had let herself get lost in it. She had let herself push down those swells of anger and pain in order to see if she could feel <i>anything else,</i> and she had kissed Agatha.</p><p>Rio groaned, all but flinging herself back onto the bed, a loud and heavy sigh pulling from her lips. What had she done? She had been doing so damn well at keeping those walls up, at keeping that distance solid between them. She had been weak. She had wanted the comfort, wanted to feel like life wasn't a complete and utter disaster. She had needed the reminder that she was still alive when every single part of her was so numb that she didn't know whether she'd been asleep or awake the last year of her life.</p><p>There was not really a choice here; she had to face this head-on, no matter how uncomfortable the idea had made her. She was going to have to lay the ground rules of how this parenting thing was going to work, and she was going to have to be clear that what had happened? It was a mistake. It wouldn't happen again.</p><p>After a few more moments of some severely intense self-reflection, Rio found it in herself to drag her body out of bed, forcing herself through the routine of brushing her teeth and washing her face. She shuffled down the hallway, slowing as she reached the doorway of the nursery, peering inside. It was empty.</p><p>Her lips twisted slightly as she moved toward and down the stairs, listening. It was quiet. Silent, even. There was nye a sound in the entire house, and Rio felt, with the blink of her eyes, as the panic seized her, wrapping around her like a constrictor. Her heart started to thud harder in her chest, a thin sheen of sweat forming on the back of her neck. Where were they? She paced over to the den; also empty. She opened the downstairs bathroom to darkness and then nearly slammed it in dismay.</p><p>She was marching toward her phone on the kitchen counter when she heard it -- singing.</p><p>
  <i>"God, my god, where have you been?"</i>
</p><p>She stilled, frozen in place about a foot away from the back door. Her heart was still hammering and she still felt sick, but she realized that the anxiety had been for nothing. They were safe, they were home.</p><p>No, Delilah was home. Agatha was... nothing more than a guest.</p><p>Slowly, she slid the door open and Agatha's eyes met her, a tight but somewhat warm smile tugging on her lips.</p><p>"Everything okay?" Rio asked, struggling against the way her middle wanted to soften at the sight of the sleeping baby in Agatha's arms.</p><p>Agatha gave a taught nod, her eyes falling back to the greenery of the yard. "There's coffee made."</p><p>Something in Agatha had shifted. There was a frigid chill there and Rio felt it stab at something in her chest.</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>Rio had started to head back inside, but Agatha's voice caught her attention.</p><p>"Rio?"</p><p>"Yeah?"</p><p>Agatha didn't look at her, didn't even stutter as she spoke, her eyes still cast out directly in front of her.</p><p>"I want half custody."</p><p>Resigned, Rio's head fell and she breathed a sigh of defeat. She had known this was coming and yet, it didn't make it any easier to hear.</p><p>"We'll have that conversation once I've had some caffeine."</p><p>Agatha's mouth turned down in a frown; she was dissatisfied with such an answer, but she also knew that what it might turn into? Well, she didn't need to be cradling infant when it happened.</p><p>Without another word, the door slid shut, slicing like a divide between the two women on either side of it. There Agatha sat, a life in her grasp, soaked in the warmth and sun the day had to offer, and there stood Rio in that kitchen, doing what she could to not let her anger ruin the hopes they had for that little girl.</p><p>In a way, she was jealous. She was jealous that Agatha was acting like this was nothing, like it was so easy, some walk in the park. Agatha was handling this with utter aplomb, and it put Rio off in a way she did not know how to put into words.</p><p>She busied herself with making coffee, drinking it as fast as the toughness in her mouth would allow as the hot liquid poured in, providing some semblance of warmth to her being. She had been cold for days, and she had a feeling that was not going to be changing any time soon.</p><p>When Agatha had returned inside, she had not said a word. She simply made another bottle and dumped out the rest of her own coffee, all while cradling Delilah in one arm. She did not ask for help, she did not ask for a thing as Rio just watched. Part of her was so wrapped up in their situation that the thought did not even cross her mind that Agatha was acting this way because of their exchange that morning.</p><p>Agatha was a cold human, but even in her pain, she had never been so frigid in front of Rio.</p><p>She disappeared with light footfalls up the stairs, and Rio could hear as she made it to the nursery and settled in. She looked down into the remnants of her coffee, the threat of tears burning at the backs of her eyes. How had they gotten here? How was this the life she was now living? A new baby and her ex-wife being the one to take the reigns in making sure she was taken care of.</p><p>She was not sure how much time had passed when she was pulled to attention by the sound of Agatha coming down the stairs. She placed herself in one of the plush chairs at the far end of the coffee table, her arms folding defensively, automatically over her middle, as if she were trying to seal off any weak spots Rio might lunge for.</p><p>The thick tension of the miserable silence hung heavy over them. Rio had not dared to meet Agatha's penetrating stare, and Agatha had hardly blinked even once.</p><p>"I'm looking for a house," Agatha stated, the hollowness in her tone sinking something in the pit of Rio's stomach. "It shouldn't take me long."</p><p>Rio blinked down into her mug, fighting the tide of helplessness that was begging to choke her, to pull the life from her. She was reserved in her silence, trying to find something, <i>anything</i> to say, but she just wanted to cry.</p><p>How was this fair? How did Agatha of all people get to feel like she could just waltz in and start making demands?</p><p>Then again, that claim wasn't very fair, either.</p><p>Rio had asked, however indirectly. The moment she had sent that text, letting Agatha know what she had been told, there had been the question hanging around, always unspoken.</p><p>
  <i>Will you help me?</i>
</p><p>It had never touched her lips, but she knew it hadn't needed to. Agatha heard it without it ever making a single sound wave.</p><p>"You don't need to do that," Rio managed back, though she did not lift her head even an inch. "I can keep her here. You can come over when you want." It was offered as something that might have been easier, but Rio almost immediately realized her mistake.</p><p>Despite the lack of conviction in her words, something about them caused a flare of heat to spike up the length of Agatha's spine.</p><p>"Absolutely not. I'm not playing this game with you, Rio." Her voice was hard, cold. "She's not a pawn to be pushed across a board, not a toy to be played with. She's a fucking <i>baby</i> and I won't have her in the middle of... whatever the fuck this is," she shot, waving her hand aggressively between the two of them.</p><p>Finally, Rio managed to lift her gaze, the panic seizing tighter as it landed on Agatha.</p><p>She was angry.</p><p>Her face was flushed and Rio could see that little vein beginning to bulge in her neck. It had been a very long time since she had seen a truly angry Agatha, and it had been almost just as long since she had seen anything other than the husk she had been since Nicky's death. The Agatha she had been dealing with the last couple of days had been reserved, understanding, even soft. But this Agatha? This Agatha had a hot fire burning in her eyes.</p><p>For as much as Rio wanted to sink? The challenge in front of her was too much to back down from.</p><p>"How dare you," she threw back lowly, her tone barely above an angry growl. "How fucking dare you accuse me of being that goddamn manipulative. That's always been <i>your</i> strong suit."</p><p>There was a hot flash of white light in Agatha's eyes.</p><p>
  <i>"Fuck you, Rio."</i>
</p><p>"Fuck me, Agatha? Yeah, okay," she shot back, rolling her eyes. "Fuck me for thinking you deserved to know about this. Fuck me for needing your help."</p><p>"But you never <i>asked!</i> You knew, you've always known, that if you call, I will answer." The frustration was a clear mask across her entire expression. "I don't owe you a goddamn thing, Rio, but I love you <i>so</i> fucking much that I would literally drop every single thing going on in my world to be there for you. You <i>knew</i> that, and <i>that's</i> why you picked up that phone and texted me. Don't sit there on your moral high-horse and act like you did it in any way for <i>my</i> feelings."</p><p>"You're right!" Rio bellowed back, "Because I don't give a single <i>fuck</i> about your feelings."</p><p>Agatha blinked for a moment, stunned by the words that had hit her ears, but the visible way her expression shifted, as if she'd thrown her entire being into top gear, was absolutely dangerous.</p><p>"That's right Rio. Because it's all about <i>you.</i> Everything about this is all about Rio Fucking Vidal. Because you're the only one that lost a son, right? You're the one who held his lifeless body in your arms? You're the one who has pounded whiskey every single night for a year, just to get two hours of sleep? Oh right, no. You're the one that's been wondering just how much better the world might be if you weren't in it. Er, no. Wrong again." Agatha was nearly sweating as she pushed on, digging deeper. "You're the one who's been sat up in this castle, this <i>fucking mausoleum,</i> acting like you're somehow better than me because I was the one who made the mistake."</p><p>Each insult, a blade. Each jab, a wound. Rio's composure did not waver, but what Agatha was nearly shouting at her? There was some weight there, even if the Rio in that moment was far too indignant to admit it.</p><p>She kept going, and Rio didn't stop her.</p><p>"Don't you think I know it? Do you think that when I look at myself in any reflective surface, I don't see the fucking monster that ignored her wife and let her son die as a result? I see it, Rio. I see it every single goddamn day. And I <i>hate</i> that woman." Agatha's voice cracked over the stressed words, her eyes beginning to glass over with the threat of angry tears. "I hate her so fucking much that it burns me from the inside out. So, here I sit, hoping that I can <i>somehow</i> dig deep enough within myself to be a far better grandmother than I ever was a mom."</p><p>The silence laid between them, like a battlefield at their feet, and Agatha could hardly move her eyes from her ex-wife's face, even despite the fact that she wasn't looking back.</p><p>Then, Rio spoke.</p><p>"I don't need you guilt tripping me, Agatha. I get it."</p><p>At this, Agatha was on her feet in an instant, the anger rising to something that was just too much to contain from a sitting position.</p><p>"I don't need this. And you better figure it out, because I'm here, <i>right fucking here,</i> and I am not going anywhere. Unless, of course, you'd rather give me full custody."</p><p>That sneer, that venomous tone that seeped out of her did something to Rio, who was also on her feet in the blink of an eye.</p><p>"Over my dead body."</p><p>"Then get it the fuck together and figure out how you can live with the idea that I actually give a shit and want to help raise that beautiful little girl. Fuck, maybe one day you'll wake up and see that I've been on your side this entire fucking ti--"</p><p>She was still in her tirade, but she was silenced by the sheer amount of force that was suddenly on her jaw, jerking her forward.</p><p>As she had ranted on, Rio had been listening to every single word, absorbing each and every dagger that Agatha was sinking into her. And she was right. Rio knew. Rio knew that Agatha was on her side, that she cared, that she wanted to help. But that wasn't good enough. It wasn't good enough for Rio until Agatha felt all of her pain, too.</p><p>And so, in a mixture of empathy and wanting Agatha to stop talking, Rio grabbed her face and silenced her with a rough and heavy kiss.</p><p>In a flash, Agatha was so impossibly confused that she hardly knew how to react.</p><p>Rio was kissing her again.</p><p>This time she was very much awake.</p><p>Though the fight in her was still strong, something overpowered it. Something like longing. Like missing. Like distance.</p><p>Though she was still seething, there was this flash of desperation in her that melted her into that kiss, feeding right back into it. Their lips smacked and teeth clicked as they kissed harder, hotter, heavier, until --</p><p>Both of Agatha's hands raised, her fingers circling around Rio's wrists. At the same time, she pulled their lips apart. With a measured certainty, she slowly pulled Rio's hands off of her face, her eyes flickering open to behold the other woman, but there was still the sour taste of the words she had been saying when she had been cut off as they sat in her mouth.</p><p>After a thick, silent moment, Agatha pushed Rio's hands back toward her body.</p><p>
  <i>"I'm going home. Call me when you figure it out."</i>
</p><p>The sting of the venom in her tone was fresh and hot as Agatha let Rio go, a soft push of her wrists as they released from her grasp.</p><p>Rio managed to keep composure as Agatha moved about, gathering her things, and then let the door thud shut behind her without a goodbye.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>This was bad.</p><p>And it probably wasn't going to get any better.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>It had been hours since Agatha had walked out of Rio's home, refraining from slamming the door solely for Delilah's sake.</p><p>It could have all gone so differently, and who did she have to blame for the complete death spiral that day had taken?</p><p>Herself, naturally.</p><p>Had Rio kissed her in the early hours of the morning? Yes.</p><p>Would Rio have been able to kiss her if she had not had the entirely idiotic idea to crawl into bed with her? No.</p><p>Hours ago, Agatha walked out of Rio's front door, climbed into her car and headed straight for the one place she had been trying to avoid like the plague for the last eight months.</p><p>She had been perched at the backless stool that was pulled up to the cherry top bar inside of The Mage's Hand for hours, and she had lost count of the number of whiskeys she had ordered, and immediately consumed.</p><p>Agatha hadn't been in that bar for a very long time, and for a very good reason.</p><p>Four months after losing Nicky, she had been thrown into the drunk tank for the night per protocol, but Alice had retrieved her shortly after 2am and took her home.</p><p>
  <i>"Agatha, you're literally a city detective. You can't just beat the shit out of anyone who irritates you, especially in a public place." Alice's voice was soft but still admonishing.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Yeah, well. Maybe he should have not grabbed my ass. Bet that did not even cross his mind!" Agatha disputed, throwing herself back into the seat with a scoff. She folded her arms over her middle, looking out the window.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Jonah said one more time and you're blackballed."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Another scoff, this one accompanied by an eyeroll.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"I spend more money in there than anyone else in the entire precinct."</i>
</p><p>
  <i>"Honey, I think that's the problem."</i>
</p><p>That conversation with Alice had been a very sobering one. And so, Agatha had stopped drinking as much. Sure, she still had the nightly whiskey to help her sleep, but she no longer spent the majority of her nights getting completely shitfaced, struggling to find a way home. She reserved her drinking for the privacy of her own walls.</p><p>Or, she had.</p><p>"Last one, Harkness," Jonah informed her gruffly as he slid the last shot glass over the bar top to her. She lifted her eyes to take him in.</p><p>Maybe some people would have found him intimidating; he was six and a half feet tall, a smooth bald head but then a thick, well-maintained beard. There was not a bare patch of skin on his arms and the lobes had been stretched large enough to have a noticeable hole through them. Agatha, though? Even before she had gotten to know him, he had never really put her on edge the way he did with most others.</p><p>In getting to know him a little better, it surprised her just how soft he was despite his outward exterior. Still, he had his moments. And she was about to be reminded of that pretty quickly.</p><p>She had been halfway through that last glass when, out of nowhere, she felt a hand slide along the small of her back.</p><p>Her heart stopped -- just one fleeting moment -- as she considered the possibility that Rio had followed her.</p><p>That was stupid. She had a baby.</p><p>Agatha lifted her head, eyes sweeping up to take in the sight of whoever thought it was a brilliant idea to touch her.</p><p>Ralph. <i>Ugh.</i></p><p>"Fuck off, Ralph," Agatha grumbled lowly, the slightest touch of a slur lacing her words as she swatted his hand away.</p><p>"Oh, come on, Agatha. I think today's the day. You're gonna cave."</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes.</p><p>"Ralph, I am fuckin' <i>hammered</i> and I am still <i>never</i> going to fuck you," she informed him, swaying toward him slightly as she lifted a hand to poke a finger in his chest as if she were accentuating her point.</p><p>The way her took hold of her hand both caused her to grimace, and happened to stamp that big red button in her that had just been begging to be pushed.</p><p>Her hand moved with a depth and quickness, simply flipping over so that she could take hold of his first two fingers, yanking back in a motion that elicited a loud <i>CRACK</i> and an even louder scream from Ralph as he leaned forward. Something primal and instinctive in Agatha reacted without hesitation, pulling her arm back to release a punch that was damn near a haymaker, landing right between his eyebrows. His nose, too, let out a noise that sent a shiver up the spine of anyone within earshot.</p><p>"HARKNESS!" Jonah barked, coming around the bar with a wooden baseball bat in his hand.</p><p>Agatha waggled her hands out emphatically, her eyes mockingly wide.</p><p>"Oooooh, Jonah. You gonna hit me with that big ol' bat?"</p><p>He'd had enough.</p><p>"Out. And don't come back."</p><p>"Oh, come on, Jonah. Every single man I have put in his place in here has put his hands on me."</p><p>"I said out."</p><p>Her face fell into a pout as she watched him, seeing if he would waver. When she didn't budge, he spoke again.</p><p>"I've already called you a ride."</p><p>She exhaled an angry huff through her nose and dramatically leaned forward, slapping her hand down on the bar on top of her credit card. She slowly slid it toward her on the bar top, her eyes never wavering from his. Finally, she picked it up, realizing that he was not going to change his mind.</p><p>She breathed another irritated huff of a sigh, all but stomping out of the bar and into the cool night air. She reached up, smoothing her hair, though even doing so caused her to sway unsteadily. Who the fuck had he called? Whoever it was, she was not going to stick around to find out. And so, she turned to her right and began to walk, so drunk that she did not realize she was heading in the opposite direction of her apartment.</p><p>Agatha walked for a good ten minutes when she heard the crushing of gravel behind her as the familiar sight of the black Tahoe rolled up next to her, the window rolling down.</p><p>"Get in, Agatha."</p><p>"Eat a dick, Kale."</p><p>The last person Agatha wanted to see pulling up next to her when she was drunk off her ass was Jennifer Kale. Sure, she was currently a dispatcher, but Agatha had not been oblivious to the fact that she had been training, testing. She wanted to be a part of the force, of the camaraderie the women in that department had. Agatha could admire that.</p><p>Still, that did not detract from the fact that Jen was as annoying as a thorn in the side with her dry humor and obsessive need for control in the majority of situations she encountered. She was a good person, sure. She was just the human equivalent of nails on a chalkboard, if you asked Agatha.</p><p>"Alice gave me her cuffs if you won't listen," she attempted to threaten, but Agatha's cackle was almost instant.</p><p>"I would <i>loveeeee</i> to see you try, Jenny," Agatha shot over her shoulder, still walking. "I can't walk a straight line right now, but I could still out-wrestle you."</p><p>Jen's jaw clenched, her attention torn between watching the road and also making sure Agatha did not try to drunkenly bolt.</p><p>"I think we both know that neither of us want that to happen. So why don't you just get in, and I can take you home so that you can sleep this off?"</p><p>Agatha came to an abrupt halt, and a second late, Jen pressed the brakes, stopping just ahead of where she could look at Agatha through the window. In an instant, Agatha was walking again and Jen's foot was easing off the brake. Just as she started to roll at a steady pace, Agatha repeated the process, her exterior not showing a trace of the sheer thrill she was getting out of fucking with Jen. She began walking for the third time, but Jen had caught on.</p><p>"For fuck's sake, Agatha. Get in the fucking car. You're not even going the right way."</p><p>Visibly, Agatha's shoulders sank with the signal that she was done fighting it. She shuffled over and pulled the door open, climbing into the passenger's seat. The pout she wore was reminiscent of something a teenage girl would parade around when dissatisfied with life's circumstances.</p><p>Life's current circumstances? They fucking sucked.</p><p>And Agatha? Boy, was she dissatisfied.</p><p>She sat in indignant silence as Jen got them turned around and headed in the right direction. It only lasted about five minutes before Jen spoke.</p><p>"Agatha... are you okay?"</p><p>"I'm <i>swell,</i> can't you tell?" she pitched back with a sharp sarcastic bite ringing like a bell over every single word.</p><p>Jen wiggled a little in her seat, her posture stiffening. "Look, I know you don't want to talk, and that's fine... but--"</p><p>"Why the hell are you even the one picking me up?" Agatha butted in -- loudly.</p><p>"I lost a coin toss to Alice. I've got to stop picking tails."</p><p>At this, a truly amused snort sounded from low in Agatha's throat. They literally were fighting over who <i>had</i> to spend their personal time tending to the absolute shit show that was Agatha. There was some humor in it, but only because she was just too drunk to see how sad it really was. No one liked her, and for good reason. She wasn't a good person. She wasn't a nice person.</p><p>Sometimes, she wondered if she was even a person at all.</p><p>"Look," Jen said, her tone firm and cutting, this time commanding Agatha's attention without also picking up a witty retort along the way. "Your life... it fucking sucks."</p><p>"Oof," Agatha mused, "Great pep talk, Kale."</p><p>"Shut up, Agatha, and just listen for once in your life. Your life sucks, yes. You fight yourself every single day and you think we don't see it, but we do. We're proud of you every day you don't turn up at that bar, and we're proud of you every day you show up to work and pour your all into it. You don't have to like any of us, Agatha, but you're still family."</p><p>Agatha had fallen deathly silent as her gaze cast out, strong as steel, watching the houses as they passed by, one after the other. Jen continued.</p><p>"It's okay to ask for help --"</p><p>Another snort, though there was a quick follow up.</p><p>"Someone should tell my ex-wife that," she mused darkly, tracing a fingertip along the inside of the window, if for no other reason than to leave a smudge that would surely annoy the fuck out of Jen later.</p><p>Though Agatha wasn't looking at her, Jen's posture softened, as did the expression on her face.</p><p>"This is about Rio?"</p><p>Agatha groaned, pressing her hand to her forehead. "This isn't therapy hour, Kale. It's a foregone conclusion that my life is a hot fucking mess, everyone knows that. And everyone knows why. And who's fault is it? It's mine. Me. I fucked my own life up. I might as well have killed Rio, while I was at it, cause whatever the fuck's walking around in her skin?" She let out a disgusted, drunken hiss.</p><p>"You mean what happened when Nick died?"</p><p>
  <i>"Yeah, that's what I mean."</i>
</p><p>Jen was quiet. More quiet than Agatha had ever heard her be.</p><p>"Spit it out."</p><p>"I am no therapist... but I think the main problem both of you have right now is that you didn't just lose your son... You lost each other, too."</p><p>A crack of lightning struck up to the base of Agatha's skull, sending a searing pain from the back to the front, her eyes instantly springing with tears.</p><p>"Let me out," Agatha demanded suddenly, trying the handle on the locked door. Deftly, Jen reached down and set the child locks.</p><p>"We're almost there, Agatha," Jen breathed, exasperated. She was very aware that she had touched a live nerve, but with any luck, Agatha was drunk enough that once she got home and passed out? She just might not remember that Jen had been so bold as to say something so stupid.</p><p><i>"I fucking hate you, Kale," </i> Agatha managed in a sound so pathetic, something that mixed between self-loathing and a disgruntled whine.</p><p>For a second, just one split second, Jen actually felt bad for Agatha.</p><p>
  <i>"Yeah, Agatha, I know."</i>
</p><p>And then she pulled up and unlocked the door. Without hesitation, or a thanks, or even a goodbye, Agatha pushed the door open and spilled out onto the sidewalk, somehow managing to stay upright on her feet. She shoved the door shut and all but stomped up the stairs to the building. As she begrudgingly punched in the security code, she was completely unaware as Jen sat, idling in the street until the very moment that Agatha disappeared inside the building.</p><p>Whatever happened after that? Well, Jen had done her part.</p><p>----------------------------</p><p>When Agatha woke up to a skull-shattering pounding reverberating through her head, she wanted to groan but was far too terrified the vibration of her own vocal cords might, in fact, put a hole through the bones of her skull.</p><p>She lifted her head to face it forward and immediately, in utter defeat, let it drop, the fabric of the pillowcase filling her nostrils and hugging every other part of her face. She had hoped it might, in some non-sensical way, help to subdue the absolute jackhammering going on above her shoulders.</p><p>What the fuck had she drank?</p><p>How the hell had she gotten home?</p><p>She felt around the bed for her phone and frowned as she realized it was not within her immediate reach. The softest grunt passed through her lips as she lifted herself up enough to look around, leaning over the edge of the bed to see it on the floor. She reached down and picked it up, flipping it over to see her notifications.</p><p>It was just one. A text.</p><p>She swiped up and unlocked the screen. The smallest part of her heart that had started to lift instead bottomed out when she saw it was from Jen.</p><p>
  <i>"Let me know you're alive. Hope you made it up safe."</i>
</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes, though an instant wave of regret smacked into her for doing so, rolling in hard right along with a wave of nausea, too.</p><p>Before she could process, she was leaping out of bed, clamoring to the best of her abilities into the bathroom, making it in just enough time to heave into the toilet.</p><p>This must be her penance; she'd made terrible decision after terrible decision.</p><p>She had thought she could tread into Rio's life, however carefully, and that had blown up. She had thought she could show up at Mage's Hand and not make an ass of herself. Again, another explosion. She had thought, when she looked into Delilah's eyes, that she could finally fucking be <i>something.</i> Just how swimmingly was that going?</p><p>If the way she was retching into the toilet was any indication?</p><p>Agatha was dangling, very precariously, right over the very jagged surface of rock bottom, and the tether that was holding her seemed to fray with every single wrong move she made. She had once been so high up, so above the rest of the world. She lived in that ivory tower with the two people she loved most in the world. And then, like bungee jumping with a faulty cord before she was ready to actually jump, she'd lost her footing.</p><p>She'd plummeted. Straight down, she had careened at a break-neck speed toward a definitive end.</p><p>Then, there was suddenly Delilah.</p><p>Delilah.</p><p>That beautiful ray of sunshine. Those gorgeous green eyes that had once belonged to Nicky. Their Nicky.</p><p>Delilah was there, and the cord pulled taut. She was no longer falling, no longer plunging toward uncertainty. Still hanging directly above it? Absolutely, but her momentum had come to a halt. She was no longer in immediate risk of disappearing into the darkness, but that hadn't meant that the darkness wouldn't reach out, just enough to grace her. It was just enough to touch her, to dust her being with a shadow of darkness.</p><p>She leaned back on her heels, wiping at her mouth as she reached to flush the toilet. Her head tilted back and she opened her eyes, staring up at the ceiling. That stupid ceiling in that stupid apartment.</p><p>That was what she could do while she waged an active war on not being completely pissed that Rio had not reached out.</p><p>She could look for a house.</p><p>She could find a home.</p><p>She could find somewhere that wasn't haunted by the ghosts of her past, both dead and living. That was all Rio was to her at this point, wasn't it? She was a specter, some projection of the woman Agatha had spent decades of her life loving.</p><p>At the root of it all, Agatha did understand, and that was what made the entirety of it so damn hard. Agatha understood Rio's anger. She understood the hesitance. She completely got the idea that she still had all of these unresolved feelings that she was clearly never going to open up about. She even got it, for all of two seconds, when Rio had kissed her.</p><p>Maybe even now, she still did.</p><p>Maybe that's why it hurt so fucking bad. The first kiss? It had irritated Agatha when she'd given herself the space and time to ruminate on it, but the second? That one had pissed her off. There had been a time when their shouting matches could be quelled by the swell of heat that could be brought on by an aggressive kiss, or a catch of a swinging palm mid-air, but those days were long gone.</p><p>The fight she'd put up in that living room? It had been the last bit of fuel she'd had in her tank. If Rio was not going to handle this cordially between the two of them? Well, Agatha knew a few people, and those people knew people. She knew she could probably have an attorney on call by the end of the week.</p><p>Was that the road she wanted to walk? Was that the trial she wanted to force herself to endure? Of course not. The absolute last thing she wanted was to place herself in a courtroom across from Rio where more and more people could be witness to their dysfunction. She didn't want this to be some public display of her power and station. She didn't want it to come to blows like that.</p><p>As angry as she was at her, she still loved Rio, and it was not her main mission in life to see that she was completely miserable. She wanted Rio to find a way to be happy, wanted to see her find some spark of life again. She wanted to see in Rio what she knew she, herself, put off when she looked at Delilah. She wanted to see that she could look at that baby and understand her for the opportunity she was.</p><p>They were never getting Nicky back. That was something the whole universe knew. Death had claimed him, pulled him right from Agatha's arms. That was an immovable fact of the universe.</p><p>But a part of him? A part of him was right there, and Agatha was sure of it every single time she looked into that little girl's eyes. Couldn't Rio see it? Couldn't she see what Agatha saw?</p><p>What <i>did</i> she see? Did she see the son she could not ever get over losing? Did she see a responsibility she was not ready for? Did she see a beacon of a past life that the two of them had lived together, seventeen years ago?</p><p>Agatha was all too aware that she would likely never know. She would likely never actually get Rio to open up to her again. She would never know what it was that was going on behind those dark green eyes. They were filled with nothing but storms and turmoil anymore. Oh, how Agatha would have killed to see light int them again.</p><p>She pushed herself to her feet and climbed back into bed, pulling her laptop into her lap with a defiant breath of annoyance passing through her lips. Part of her felt like house hunting at that moment was going to be done out of spite, but she reminded herself that it was a necessity if she had any hopes of actually securing a split custody agreement with Rio. She had to prove that she was capable, that she was fit to be caring for this child.</p><p>So, she had spent hours scrolling through listings, submitting applications, scheduling viewings. It had been a busy few hours, but by the time she shut her laptop, she felt rather accomplished in what she had set out to do. Nothing was set in stone, but a couple of them left her feeling hopeful.</p><p>She glanced down at her phone; the notifications were empty and a bold 5:04 was emblazoned across the top section of the screen. Another annoyed sigh escaped her slightly parted lips as her shoulders slumped.</p><p>All she wanted was Rio to figure her shit out. Why was that so much to ask?</p><p>With a groan of disapproval at the way her body reacted to her movement, she managed to hoist herself out of bed and into the bathroom. She peeled off her shirt before she turned on the water, the room beginning to fill with steam in only moments. She finished stripping down and stepped into the shower, setting about her normal routine.</p><p>Mid-lather, her phone started to ring from where it sat on the sink. She rolled her eyes -- it was probably Jen with that annoying persistence to make sure she wasn't dead -- and went about her task. The ringing stopped and she could see through the curtain as the screen dimmed again. Then, not thirty seconds later, it rang again.</p><p>Her brow pulled together and she pulled the curtain back partially, enough that she could stick her head out to try and get a better look at who could have been calling her.</p><p>She didn't need to see the actual letters to know who it was. The only other person Agatha knew with three letters in their name that wasn't Jen was Rio.</p><p>In a rush that nearly caused her to slip and tumble out of the bathtub, Agatha whipped the curtain back and leapt out, soaking wet and still dripping as she crossed the bathroom to the counter. She reached up, trying to dry her hand off as quick as she could on the hand towel above the sink, succeeding in just enough time to answer the call before it kicked over the voicemail.</p><p>"Rio?" Agatha nearly gasped, both from shock and the exertion of trying to make it to her phone in time.</p><p>
  <i>"Agatha?"</i>
</p><p>"Rio, what's wrong?"</p><p>
  <i>"I... I need help. I... I need you, Agatha."</i>

  <p>What Agatha had walked into had not been what she had expecting when she had hung up the phone with Rio and all but sprinted to her car to practiclly fly over. The remnants of the hangover from the night before still lingered in her brain stem, but she shoved away the annoying tug as she set every ounce of focus she had on getting where she needed to be.</p><p>Rio's.</p><p>She threw the car into park in the driveway and left her keys dangling from the ignition as she tore out of the vehicle, the door slamming shut in her wake. Thankfully, the front door was unlocked, but what Agatha saw when she opened that door?</p><p>Rio had said she was hurt.</p><p>She didn't say there would be so much blood. Instantly, Agatha blanched at the sight, and then tuned into everything else; Delilah was absolutely screaming, wailing like her life depended on it. Agatha's eyes were wide and wild, trying to locate the source of the sound, as well as where Rio might be. Her eyes dropped to the floor.</p><p><i>Do what you do best, Harkness,</i> she bit mentally, closing her eyes for a moment as she drew in a steadying breath. <i>Follow the trail.</i></p><p>She opened her eyes with a new focus; they lifted to the kitchen and saw the culprit. The coffee container had been knocked off the counter, the shattered glass a treacherous path over the kitchen floor. That was where it began. A larger chunk of the glass was laying to the side, covered halfway in blood.</p><p>Shit. Agatha didn't even need to see the wound to know it was likely going to need stitches. She had figured at the amount of blood, but seeing the shard solidified it in her mind. She glanced back down, mapping the path out by the course of footsteps. Rio had, obviously panicked, paced a couple of times in the kitchen, and then stood at the edge of the counter -- where a bit more blood had pooled -- likely when she had called Agatha. The next steps seemed to lead to the door, which she had unlocked, and then doubled back.</p><p>Agatha followed them with her gaze as she realized that they headed up the stairs. In a rush, she was pushing through the house and ripping up those stairs, taking them two at a time. They trailed down the hall, and as Agatha reached the doorway of the nursery, she was torn. It was clear that Rio had gone inside, and that was why Delilah lay screaming in her crib. But then, the path doubled back and went down the hallway, toward Rio's room, and the master bathroom.</p><p>Agatha's lips pressed together in a tight line, her gaze sweeping back and forth between the hallway and the fussing baby. She was so impossibly torn, but she forced herself into the choice. She tucked into the nursery, immediately tending to her granddaughter. She cradled her, bounced her, changed her, and checked the time to see that there was still a little bit to go before she got her evening bottle.</p><p>After what felt like an eternity, Agatha had managed to soothe her, slipping the binky into her mouth as she laid her down inside of the crib.</p><p>"I know all of that screaming must have given you a work out," Agatha breathed at her, tracing her fingertip down the tiny nose.</p><p>When she was satisfied that she could be left unattended, Agatha leaned over the railing and graced her forehead with a soft brush of lips. She straightened back up and glanced over to the door.</p><p>Time to face the reaper.</p><p>She sucked in a breath and kept it tight in her lungs for a long moment before she found the courage to release it, and at the same time, the courage to start the dauntless journey to a bedroom that wasn't hers anymore. With a bed in it that she never should have climbed into.</p><p>She stepped through the doorway, glancing around, though all she needed to do was look down to follow that trail. It curved into the bathroom and Agatha exhaled a sigh through her nose.</p><p>"Rio?"</p><p>The softest sound -- a sniffle -- echoed off of the walls of the bathroom. Cautiously, Agatha pressed forward, slowly peering around the edge of the doorway, nearly losing her breath at the sight before her.</p><p>There, sat on the edge of the tub, was Rio, hunched over and carefully pulling remaining pieces of glass out of the bottom of her foot. She would hiss, or sniffle, and Agatha was not even sure she had heard her call her name. She gave a light tap on the door and Rio's face -- tear stained and distraught -- completely shattered her.</p><p>"Rio..."</p><p>Agatha pressed forward, though she was careful with her movements, as if she might startle the other woman if she was too sudden or too rash. Slowly, Agatha lowered herself onto the floor in front of Rio, not caring that the blood immediately began to seep into her leggings.</p><p>Her eyes lifted, finding Rio's dark, normally steely gaze.</p><p>What she saw there now?</p><p>Rio was fucking terrified. She was lost, she was confused. She was looking at Agatha like she was the first sight of salvation she had seen in ages.</p><p>She hadn't looked at Agatha like that in <i>so long.</i></p><p>Agatha did not let the emotion it welled inside of her touch her face. Instead, her question was soft in its earnest tone.</p><p>"Can I help you?"</p><p>The battle in Rio? It died, right that very moment. She could have her emotions toward Agatha, but she could have them later. She could have them with a clearer head. Right then, she just needed someone.</p><p>
  <i>No, she needed Agatha.</i>
</p><p>Rio's head finally budged into a soft nod, the tears still silently leaking down her cheeks. She knew that resisting? It had only hurt her thus far. She wasn't sure she was anywhere near a full pardon and a welcoming hug, but something in that moment, in the core of Rio, it snapped.</p><p>Slowly, she lifted her leg, moving so that Agatha could survey the damage on the bottom of her foot.</p><p>As Agatha pulled Rio's foot into her lap, she had to actively fight the grimace that wanted to overtake her. She didn't want to cause anymore stress, but it wasn't great.</p><p>Her eyes traced over the sole, her lips twisting.</p><p>"It looks like you got most of it. There's one right here... it's in pretty deep. I..." She looked up at Rio, a flash of fear in her eyes.</p><p>Rio's hand lifted off of the edge of the bathtub and picked up the tweezers, handing them over the Agatha, who thanked her softly.</p><p>"This is going to suck," Agatha informed her, securing her arm around Rio's foot to hold it steady if she tried to jerk away. She glanced up for Rio's response and was met with a silent nod. She drew in a steady breath and pressed the tip of the tweezers into the wound where she could see the glass glinting in the light.</p><p>"Fuck! Gods be damned!" Rio wailed, breaking off another piece of Agatha simply at the sound.</p><p><i>"I'm sorry,"</i> Agatha murmured, her tone pained and strangled. She felt the shard catch between the tips of the tweezer and gently eased it out. She managed to remove it, setting it down on the edge of the bathtub. Her surveying gaze swept down again, double checking that nothing else had been missed.</p><p>"How's the other foot look?" She asked, her voice gentle, tender. It was a complete contrast to the way she had used it the last time she was in that house.</p><p>"It's fine," Rio dismissed, her own tone soft. This struck something in Agatha, but she found not to let it show on her face. "I got them all out already."</p><p>Agatha fought the urge to insist that she should check just to be sure, but instead turned her attention back to the still-bleeding gash near the outside of her foot.</p><p>"Well, toots," Agatha mused, sucking her cheek for a moment as her gaze shifted up toward Rio. "You've got two options. Option one: Emergency room. Option two: Doctor Agatha. Either way, it needs stitches."</p><p>"You can't just bandage it?" she asked in a low, defeated whine.</p><p>"For the sake of keeping your wellbeing intact, no, love."</p><p>Rio winced.</p><p>Agatha bit down on her lip -- hard.</p><p>"I can do it. Boy scouts taught me well," she offered, as if this would mean something to Rio.</p><p>It meant <i>everything</i> to Rio.</p><p>It was a gentle gracing of their history, so ingrained into who they were both as two separate people, and who they were when they could find a way to come together.</p><p>"There's a bottle of Jack in the freezer. I'll need it before you start," Rio admitted, and there was a quick snap of familiarity in Agatha's eyes, though it disappeared with a blink.</p><p>It was still Rio's drink of choice, too.</p><p>Agatha gave a nod and got to her feet. She disappeared out the door and was back a moment later, the cold bottle in one hand, a shot glass in the other.</p><p>"I don't need that," Rio offered with a dry chuckle, holding her hand out for the bottle. She took it with a thanks and uncapped it, taking a healthy pull from it, a soft gasp passing through her lips as she lowered it. Another second, another pull, another gasp.</p><p>If it wouldn't have been completely heartbreaking, Agatha would have been reminded of one of the many reasons why she had fallen in love with Rio. Instead, she turned to her prep, washing her hands, soaking the fishing line in alcohol, sterilizing a needle. She pulled on a pair of gloves she had found in the drawer and carefully placed herself on the floor in front of Rio.</p><p>Rio stared at her for a moment, a long, hard, hollow stare that pierced infinite holes in Agatha's soul. She took another pull of the liquor and then met her gaze again, giving another nod to signify she was ready.</p><p>Agatha had set to work; overall, it had taken her close to twenty five minutes, and that was only because she was obsessing on doing it correctly, on making sure every stitch was perfect. Rio had sat like an absolute champ, though Agatha hadn't missed it; those looks would occasionally cross her face, the ones that said she was trying to integrate the experience into her reality, despite the fact that the pain should have been grounding her.</p><p>She finished and cut the line above the knot so that there was less irritation of a loose end. She stripped off the gloves and got to her feet, tending to cleaning up after herself. She shuffled over to the cabinet, pulling the door open to pull out an ACE bandage and a cotton pad. This time, she sat on the closed toilet seat lid, patting her knee in a gentle request that Rio obliged.</p><p>She placed her heel into the meat of Agatha's thigh and Agatha was fluid in her movements, placing the pad and securing it with the bandage. She slid the clips into the bandage to keep it secure and gave the inside of Rio's ankle a gentle pat.</p><p>"Now, the true test," Agatha said softly, her eyes lifting to meet Rio's cloudy gaze. "Will you let me carry you to the bed?"</p><p>It was almost visible, the way all of the tension and anger and malice just seemed to... leave. It just evaporated off of her, like a puff of smoke that lifted from her form.</p><p>She didn't move, didn't flinch, didn't even blink. And then it came, ever so softly.</p><p>
  <i>"Yes."</i>
</p><p>Agatha's smile, while soft, was so laden with pain, with hurt, with the struggle of watching this woman she loved <i>so fucking much</i> sit there, drowning in her pain.</p><p>Rio had hurt her. That was true. But she had hurt Rio. While retaliation wasn't the answer, Agatha was also well too aware that it wasn't unfounded, either.</p><p>She got to her feet and knelt enough so that she could slide one arm behind Rio's knees, the other wrapping around her shoulder. Like ice cream on a hot day, Rio melted right into her, her own arm hooking around Agatha's neck for stability.</p><p>Agatha stood, cradling what used to be her entire world in her arms, fighting every urge she had to look down. She was an assistant, just doing what she could to help. She wasn't anything more. She paced across the room, gently placing Rio carefully on the bed.</p><p>"I'll bring you some ibuprofen for the inflammation. Water, of course. Do you... what else can I get you?"</p><p>"No, it's okay. I just need a minute, then I'll go clean everything."</p><p>"Rio," Agatha scolded in a sharp tone. "You're going to spend the next twelve to twenty-four hours in this bed because you just incurred a traumatic injury."</p><p>"I can't, Agatha," Rio sighed back, her voice heavy with exasperation. "I have things to do."</p><p>Agatha placed herself on the bed next to Rio's leg, as in front of her as she could possibly be without climbing into her lap.</p><p><i>"Hey,"</i>  Agatha breathed. <i>"Look at me."</i></p><p>Slowly, Rio's guilty and stormy gaze lifted, the weight of her conflict completely written over her entire face.</p><p>
  <i>"You called. You asked. So let me help."</i>
</p><p>Rio's lip quivered, something Agatha might have missed if she wouldn't have known any better. She knew each and every single one of Rio's tells, her gives, her expressions, her flickers. She knew what Rio looked like when she was lost.</p><p>So why wouldn't she let Agatha help her find her way back?</p><p>The reality had already crossed Agatha's mind. Rio had secluded herself, locked herself up inside the walls of that house. She knew she'd had Wanda, but what was the extent of that? The harsh truth was that Rio needed to talk to someone, and even if Agatha happened to be the one she wanted to talk to, Agatha knew that she wasn't qualified. She couldn't help Rio the way she could so clearly see now that she needed help.</p><p>That would be a fight for another day.</p><p>"Are you hungry? I can make you soup, or something light."</p><p>"I'm okay, Agatha, really."</p><p>Agatha fought the sigh that pressed at the insides of her lips, but the sigh won out, falling from her lips in a defeated puff of air. She got to her feet and did as she said she would, fetching a glass of water and the pills, setting them gingerly on the table next to the bed. She had asked again if Rio was hungry, but she insisted again that she was fine, so Agatha had no choice but to believe her.</p><p>She checked in on Delilah, who had woken up from her nap. She pressed her lips together, her eyes sweeping from the baby down to the floor. She had to clean up all of the blood, and that was going to be hard to do if she had to keep an eye on her, too.</p><p>Agatha stood at the peak of her decision for a few long moments before she made it, stepping off into the drop that would surely follow. She pulled Delilah into her arms, hugging her tightly to her chest as she grabbed a few things; a toy, the binky, her blanket. With a sense of soft determination in her steps, she carried the two of them down the hallway to Rio's room.</p><p>"Hey. I'm going to clean everything up, but she's awake. Can... Do you think she could lay in here with you until I get done? When it's time for a bottle, you can just text me and I'll get it ready."</p><p>She could read the apprehension on Rio's face like a book, and she wished so desperately that she could understand it. Why was she nervous? She had been the perfect mother, the perfect partner, the perfect woman. Where was that confident, bordering on cocky, Rio who had always been the mom yelling at school staff when Nicky had been mistreated? Where was that authoritative, take-charge Rio who commandeered any issue that crossed her path?</p><p>What sat in front of Agatha was a broken and cracked version of the woman she had known. She had made that comment to Jen the night before, about whatever it was that was walking around wearing Rio like a skin...</p><p>"I'll be as fast as I can, I promise," she asked with a gaze so soft, it seemed to scream <i>I am literally only asking you because I have no other choice, I'm sorry.</i></p><p>Rio gave an unsteady nod, watching as Agatha went to lay the baby down on the bed. Instead, Rio cleared her throat and reached forward, offering her arms to hold her instead. Agatha obliged, passing her over with a precise gentleness and carefulness.</p><p>"I'll be back as soon as I can," Agatha assured her once more, a gentle but worried smile turning up the corners of her lips as she turned and departed the bedroom.</p><p>Over the next few hours, Agatha worked her way through the house with a bucket and a bristled brush, scrubbing at every spot on the floor where Rio had bled.</p><p>It was its own form of torture, really. She didn't mind the cleaning part of it. The trauma laid in the way there were smears of blood on Agatha's palms and she was in an hours long battle of not completely losing her shit at the memory of the last time she'd had blood on her hands. She just kept working, the softest grunt or sigh passing through her lips at her effort every so often.</p><p>How had they gotten here?</p><p>Rio was <i>literally</i> bleeding out in her own stubbornness, her own refusal to just give Agatha one single chance to try and do right by her. Agatha was under no impression that they would ever have any kind of romantic relationship again, and while it hurt, she had found peace in it. She was okay with it. What she wasn't okay with was that they were staring another two decades in the face that they would have to be involved in one another's lives, and they were the absolute definition of broken dysfunction.</p><p>What Agatha wasn't okay with was the fact that all she wanted was to try to be a good person, but Rio was too lost in her own storm to see it for what it was.</p><p>While Agatha would insist that she wasn't going to let Rio slip away for Delilah's sake, there was of course more to it than that. Rio couldn't go because she hadn't seen it all, yet. There were still wonders to be witnessed, and even if Agatha wasn't the one she wanted to experience them with? Well, that was okay, so long as she got the experience of it at all.</p><p>In the first months of their loss, Agatha had been angry and wild, damn near feral. She had lashed out and anyone and everyone, but it was because she hadn't been able to take it out on Rio. She hadn't been able to see through her anger enough, at the time, to see that it was eating her alive.</p><p>Agatha had grown, and a lot of it had to do with that conversation she'd had with Alice in the car that night, but she had learned something very important.</p><p>The things she was choosing to hold onto were the heavy ones. She was never going to make forward progress if she couldn't learn to let go. And so, she had started to. It was a process, one she was still working on each and every day, but piece by piece, she was letting go of the anger, the fury, the hatred.</p><p>Rio was still stuck. Rio was still in that dark place, the one that held her down, wrapped her in vines to make sure she couldn't fight her way out. Rio was slowly suffocating, and Agatha could tell each day when the dim light that had been left slowly started to flicker out, too.</p><p>Agatha had worked her way through the house, scrubbing and wiping, scrubbing and wiping. Eventually, she had scooted her way down the hallway after finishing the nursery. She made another push forward, crossing over the threshold into Rio's bedroom. Her head lifted and what she saw stopped her, stilling her like a snapshot in time. She was half leaned forward, but she was afraid that if she even so much as blinked, it might shatter the moment.</p><p>There, propped a bit against the headboard was Rio, slumped slightly. Her neck was free from any tension and her head was hanging to the side, her eyes shut. There was even a look of -- peace? -- across her face? And on her chest, sound asleep, was Delilah, her head right above where Rio's heart was.</p><p>An instant swell of emotion crashed over Agatha, silently choking her. Her hand flew to her mouth, trying to stifle any pained sound that might try to escape her. She didn't want to wake either of them, even on accident.</p><p>She sat in silence for the longest few moments, a brutal sense of revered longing settling right in that hollow space in her chest.</p><p>Finally, after what she was sure was at least fifteen minutes, she commanded herself to move. She was as quiet as she could manage as she finished her task, cleaning both the bedroom and the bathroom. She sighed as she dropped the brush into the bucket and dropped to sit on the floor, her back against the base of the bathtub.</p><p>What was she doing there?</p><p>She'd just spent four hours scrubbing almost every single floor in a house that wasn't hers, for a woman that did not love her.</p><p>Even she didn't understand the blind devotion, but she could stew on that when she was alone, staring at that stupid ceiling in that stupid apartment.</p><p>She glanced over to her right, the bottle of Jack Daniels still sitting on the floor from when she had stitched Rio's foot. Her lips pressed together as she debated. She didn't need it, but some deep part of her felt like she had earned it.</p><p>She reached over and unscrewed the lid, not hesitating to bring the bottle to her lips, taking a strong pull of the brown liquid. Her face puckered slightly as she lowered it, but she shook it away.</p><p>Where to go from there?</p><p>She knew she could not leave the two in the other room situated as they currently were; too much could happen there, and none of it was anything Rio could handle. She didn't want to end it before she had to, though. They could sleep for a little while longer.</p><p>Something deep inside of Agatha told her that it was probably the first time Rio had gotten any sleep at all in the last few days.</p><p>Resigned, she got to her feet and quietly floated through the house, making sure that everything was back in its rightful place and that things were at least as tidy as she could get them. She was struck with a thought as her eyes swept over the living room.</p><p>She missed the days when that house <i>looked</i> like it had a baby in it.</p><p>She glided to the kitchen and quietly prepped a bottle, pulling it from the microwave before testing the temperature. It was just warm enough that she would have time to collect Delilah and get her into the nursery.</p><p>She might as well have been a ghost in that home as she moved about, floating into Rio's room and, with all the tender care she could muster, lifting the sleeping baby off of her chest. She tucked her against her own chest, shushing her softly as Delilah began to stir. Agatha knew that she could likely feed her and she would go right back to sleep, but if she was going to choose that moment to have a meltdown, she didn't want it to be in the immediate vicinity of a still sleeping Rio.</p><p>She shuffled out and tucked herself back inside of the nursery, finding her home there in that rocking chair. She had cooed at and talked to Delilah in soft tones for a little while before the baby decided she was hungry and took the bottle. By the time she was nearing the end of it, the sleep had overtaken her again.</p><p>Gingerly, Agatha removed the bottle from her lips and set it down next to her. She let the silence fall over the room, the only soft sound being that of the rocking chair as it moved back and forth. She stood, knowing that it was likely high time she remember her place in that house -- which was not being in it.</p><p>Her eyes were filled with a warm affection, one that bubbled in her chest as she looked down at that face, that adorable face that she loved so impossibly much.</p><p>She laid her in the crib and covered her with her blanket before she brushed the backs of her knuckles against one chubby cheek.</p><p>"Goodnight, angel. Fold those wings, you'll need them another day, yeah?"</p><p>Agatha's lips pulled tight into a stiff smile that was just one of the pure, raw ache in her chest. It wasn't performative, wasn't put on for anyone else's benefit. It was just a fact of Agatha's world.</p><p>Quietly, she paced back down the hallway, knowing that she should at least wake Rio to let her know she was going to leave. She edged around the bed, leaning slightly so that she could give Rio's shoulder a light shake.</p><p>"Hey... Rio..."</p><p>She gave another shake and the consciousness flickered back into her form, her eyes slowly sliding open in a confused haze.</p><p>"Hey, I just put Delilah down for the night. Everything's cleaned. I'm going to go home, but I wanted to let you know."</p><p>The panic that filled Rio's eyes? It also, at the same exact time, lodged in Agatha's throat.</p><p>
  <i>Don't.</i>
</p><p>She could see it, sitting on the very edge of Rio's lips.</p><p>
  <i>You know I can't tell you no.</i>
</p><p>Rio's throat quivered, her eyes suddenly brimming with tears as if she could hear Agatha's internal monologue on full blast.</p><p><i>"Stay with me, Agatha,"</i> she nearly begged. She knew that Agatha owed her nothing, that she could have laughed right in her face and walked out that door, but some part of Rio that understood what she had been doing to Agatha was hoping that somehow, she could see this for what it was.</p><p>Rio was asking.</p><p>No, Rio was begging.</p><p>Agatha's lips turned down at the corners, her own eyes stinging at the backs.</p><p>
  <i>"Okay."</i>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Rio had watched as her helpless gaze followed Agatha as she made her exit from Rio's bedroom, leaving Delilah cradled in her arms. The crack in Rio's heart seemed to spread, growing in size as it began to shatter her. How had she let things get so far down? How had she lost so much control that she hardly felt like she knew how to exist anymore?</p><p>She had thought that she had recovered, that she had found some some semblance of healing that she could cling to. Hell, she had been about to have a relaxing night in with dinner and the company of her sister. She had been finding some sense of normalcy, even though it had been a fight to scour for it. She had earned it, she thought.</p><p>But had she ever really had it in the first place?</p><p>She had spent night after night for months on end sleeping on Agatha's side of the bed, fighting until the absolute last moment to wash her pillowcase. It had still smelled like her, that rich vanilla and lavender, and for as much as Rio had been angry, she also felt that sudden stab of loneliness, and the wound had never really healed. She had spent a long time lying to herself, telling her that she was at peace with losing Nicky, and that she was over Agatha, but how true could that really be when you spent over twenty years of your life with someone.</p><p>They'd had their fights, they'd been angry, but this was one time that Rio had given into the temptation of letting her feelings and emotions completely devour her. This was one time where Rio had let go of any tether she'd had to the world because of the pain losing Nicky had caused her. She was falling, just plummeting through an endless abyss, wondering when she was finally going to hit the ground.</p><p>Maybe she was already there.</p><p>Her gaze swept down, landing on the cooing baby in her arms. She sat like that for a long while, just watching Delilah as she kicked and gurgled, content in her position.</p><p>The longer she sat, though, the more she missed Nicky.</p><p>Her voice was sounding, soft and just above a whisper, before she could even consider stopping herself.</p><p><i>"Your daddy would be so happy to be here right now,"</i> Rio told her, those pairs of green eyes meeting across the space, as if Delilah was showing she was actively listening.</p><p><i>"You have his eyes, you know? And if I'm seeing correctly, I think you're going to have his smile, too."</i> Rio paused, feeling the emotion bubbling up her throat.</p><p>Agatha's smile.</p><p>
  <i>"And that hair? Oh, boy that hair. We are going to spend most of your younger years keeping it in braids, I am sure. It's so much like his, so wild, with the smallest little streaks of lightness. I can't even believe how much of it you have already, it's actually crazy."</i>
</p><p>Rio's fingertips brushed through it, a tender brushing of an affection she had not yet felt when it came to the little girl in her arms. She had been under this impression that taking her on, it would fill that Nicky shaped hole that still resided within her. She had thought that the moment she looked into her eyes that everything would fall into place, that it would make sense, and that maybe it wouldn't hurt <i>this</i> much.</p><p>She had thought, however stupidly, that this could be the cure to what ailed her. The emptiness, the loneliness, the misery, they were all choking her and she was fighting to keep above water. She had thought that this could be the light, her reason for keeping on the path she had tried for a year to set herself on. She had spent day in and day out, just doing everything she could to force the narrative that she was going to heal.</p><p>There, sat right in front of her face, was the reason she was beginning to wonder if she ever would.</p><p>How could she move on from every ounce of the pain and grief she had been carrying with her, when she would look into those eyes for the rest of her life? How could she put aside her own feelings to even try to make this functionable with Agatha?</p><p>The truth was simple: She had to let herself grieve Nicky's loss. She had spent far too long just shoving it down, ignoring it. She had cried her plethora of tears, of course, but she had also gotten to a point where she had let herself become so numb that she simply didn't feel it anymore. She had actively worked for twelve painstaking months to turn off every emotion she could when it came to missing Nicky. And it had worked, until that phone call.</p><p>She had been forced to face everything she had been burying for so long, and it was sinking her. She was being pulled under, and the one hand that kept reaching out for her, she insistently smacked away. In her indignity, she was refusing to accept that she couldn't get through any part of life without Agatha's help. But there she sat, propped up against her pillows with Delilah in her arms as Agatha was undoubtedly on her hands and knees scrubbing every single drop of Rio's floor off of the blood.</p><p>As she looked back down at Delilah, something pierced her, right in the chest. Her indignance was stemming from a place of hurt and anger. In that hurt and in that anger, she had pushed Agatha away. She had made it so that she did not have to confront her own feelings. She knew, deep down, that she would always love Agatha. She had loved her from the moment their lips touched in that bean field, and she knew that over twenty years, Agatha had taken complete control of every inch of her heart. She had tended to it, taken care of it, and showered it with love and affection for so long.</p><p>What Rio was realizing, that she instantly hated?</p><p>Agatha probably would have kept doing that; she would have let Rio scream at her, hit her, take it all out on her because she knew she deserved it, but she would have stayed. She would have sat there and taken all of it, because it meant that she could still care. It meant that her presence was still there, and forceful.</p><p>Losing Nicky had been a cruel act of the universe.</p><p>Severing ties with Agatha had been a cruel act of Rio's own doing.</p><p>Whatever way it all fell down, Rio was alone because Rio had chosen to be alone. Rio was losing herself in misery because she had chosen to be alone.</p><p>In the way that Agatha blamed herself every day for Nicky's death, Rio was realizing that the blame fell on her for killing Agatha slowly over the last year. She'd seen it. Of course she'd seen it. It had been obvious the moment Agatha had walked into her home that night she'd gotten the call. That undeniable dullness in those once bright eyes, those lines that had formed from where she kept her brow pinched too tightly together.</p><p>Agatha was empty, too. But she was choosing other ways to deal with it than stewing in her own feelings.</p><p>A soft sound reached Rio's ears, the beginning of a cry, and she came back into the moment, looking down at her granddaughter. She reached over with her free hand and picked the binky up off of the bed, gently easing it between her lips to hopefully stop the sound before it could really begin. It seemed to work and Delilah softened, settling back into the crook of her arm.</p><p><i>"There was this one time,"</i> Rio breathed, her voice smoothing as if she were telling a bedtime story. <i>"Your dad was about six, and it was the first time his momma had taken him fishing. He was so very excited, and he even watched his momma go through it a couple of times, but the first time she made him put the worm on the hook?"</i> Rio's lips hitched the tiniest bit, an automatic reaction of the recollection. <i>"He cried that he killed the worm. He said it wasn't fair that the worm had to die for the fish to eat it."</i> A soft breath of a pained laugh fell from her lips and her eyes lifted, just momentarily, to stave off the threat of tears.</p><p><i>"Your dad's favorite thing, though? He'd wait until the sun went down and he'd come running in here calling for me. He'd fling himself right on this bed and crawl into my lap and beg me to get the blanket down so we could go out in the yard and look at the stars."</i> Rio's lips twisted, knowing that her voice had gone rough, and that it didn't really matter, but she didn't want to let herself get to that point. <i>"We'd make cups of hot chocolate and go outside, and do just that. We'd lay there for hours, just pointing out different pictures in the sky, and making up our own. Your daddy loved the stars. He said he wanted to be an astronomer when he grew up, but that had changed multiple times since then."</i></p><p>Rio's fingertips brushed over Delilah's forehead so tenderly, a small but sad smile on her face.</p><p>
  <i>"He would have loved you the most. You're the brightest star I've ever seen."</i>
</p><p>Rio sat like that for a couple of hours, just whispering the softest of stories about Nick to his daughter. Rio wanted her to always know about him, to know that he would have been such a good dad to her, if he'd ever been given the chance. He would have been a better parental figure to her than Rio had been since she had brought her home.</p><p>Delilah would occasionally fuss, but Rio would shift and adjust, finally winding with the baby on her belly, laying down the length of Rio's torso. She had placed the softest of kisses to her head, stilling for a moment to take in the smell of that baby shampoo and soap, letting it cause the softest flutter in her chest.</p><p>She could do this. She had to do this. But she had to get out of her own way, first. Agatha had given her very clear instruction that she needed to figure this, and herself, out before she would come back, but Rio still sat there, having no clue how to mend the gap between them. All the while Agatha was slaving herself in dedication to cleaning up a mess Rio had created.</p><p>She turned circles over the same things for as long as she could, but the lack of sleep over the course of the passing days had finally started to catch up to her. She closed her eyes, insisting to herself that it was just a brief respite. When she opened them again, though, due to a gentle jostling of her shoulder, they swept up to see Agatha, red and sweaty, a clear product of her effort.</p><p>The conversation that had followed had been difficult for Rio, because she was letting herself do something she had sworn for a year she was not going to do. She had broken down, in a moment of weakness, and asked for the help.</p><p>Agatha had agreed to stay, but she had insisted on a shower before climbing into the bed, which Rio understood. She had told her to take what she wanted out of the closet to wear, that she would wash her clothes for her in the morning, and Agatha had set off, leaving Rio to slide down the pillows, her eyes sliding shut.</p><p>What was she doing? This was a terrible idea. It was, in fact, probably one of the worst she had ever had in recent times. She knew every implication of her request, and she knew that maybe, it might hurt Agatha more than she intended it to, but she couldn't stop herself.</p><p>She had just started to doze when she felt the bed shift, sinking beneath Agatha's weight as she placed herself atop it. Rio's eyes fluttered open, her head turning so that she could look over at her. There was almost a foot of space between them on that California king and it pained some far chamber of her heart. Agatha was respecting the boundaries that Rio had been insisting on since they'd lost Nicky, but Rio was tired of it.</p><p>She was tired of being right there, <i>right fucking there,</i> and feeling like there was an entire ocean between them. She knew she was the one responsible for the distance, and in that moment as they eyes met across the bed, she hated herself for it. She wanted to close it, to just pull Agatha into her arms and tell her she was sorry, that she'd been horrible, that she'd been unfair.</p><p>
  The silence hung as thick as the tension above them, their gazes holding form across that limitless expanse of plush grey comforter.

</p><p>
  With the slightest movement, Rio's arm extended, her hand sliding across the fabric. It stopped as it reached what she perceived to be just about half of the distance between them. In the process, her eyes never once left Agatha's, but she knew she did not need to state aloud what she was doing.
</p><p>
  She laid there, waiting with baited breath, watching Agatha like her life depended on it. She was trying to offer a figurative olive branch, and she was both hoping Agatha would take it for what it was, and simultaneously bracing for her to rip it away and smack her with it. She had been putting that woman through hell for days, and for what? She was turning up each and every time she was called, working every bit of her motherly magic on that little girl. She was the one that sat on that bathroom, picking pieces of glass out of Rio's foot because she knew she needed the help, that she was struggling.
</p><p>
  The moment seemed to stretch on forever, and Rio had started to feel the threat of tears pricking at the backs of her eyes. She was on the verge of removing her hand when she sensed it: It was barely a twitch at first, but then Agatha's palm slid to the blanket. Slowly, almost painstakingly, she moved it forward, brushing her fingertips over the back of Rio's before threading them together.
</p><p>
  At the contact, Agatha's eyes slid shut and Rio could see the deep breath she took to steady herself. As they reopened, they were glassy and she could see the weight of the question on Agatha's tongue as it sat heavy in her mind.
</p><p>
  <i>
    "What are we doing Rio?"</i>
    
</p><p>
 Rio knew, immediately, that it was not a question she had an answer for. It was not something she knew how to field, not something she knew she could satisfy with a response. Her throat tightened and she swallowed down the boulder that had suddenly become lodged there, nearly keeping her from breathing.
</p><p>
<i>"I... I don't know Agatha,"</i> Rio choked in a soft cry, her fingers curling to grip a little harder at Agatha's hand. The tears had begun to slip down her cheeks, forging small rivers that emptied off of the edges of her jaw.
  
</p><p>
  Agatha's face absolutely crumpled, tears instantly springing to her own eyes. This wasn't how she wanted this to be. She didn't want this misery between them, holding them apart. She wanted to pull Rio into her arms, to stroke her hair and kiss over every inch of her face while whispering soft promises to her skin that everything would work out, that it would all be okay. She wanted to hold her so close, so tight, that she knew nothing else could get to her.
</p><p>
  Above all else, Agatha's ache to protect Rio had always been paramount to all else. How could Agatha protect Rio from herself? How could she reach into her in that way she once used to be able to, and pull the broken pieces into the right places when Rio would hardly let her get close enough to care?
</p><p>
 There was a steep jump from helping and fixing, of that Agatha was painfully aware. In her mind, the likelihood of Rio letting her fix anything between them was as gone and buried as Nicky was. What she was not seeing, in that moment, was the dimply flickering tether that had just formed between them, the joining of their fingers welding it back together. It was a tie, a line of life that held them together.
</p><p>
  That tie had formed out of love, and it had brightened with Nicky's arrival. It had gone fraught and then snapped at his death.
</p><p>
  And there it was, finally whole again, even if neither of them understood it in that moment.
  
</p><p>
  <i>"I... I need help..."</i> Rio managed, her eyes sliding shut, as though it physically wounded her to admit it out loud, but Agatha heard the undertones, the subtext that would have been scribed under it if it had been on paper.
</p><p>
  <i>"I know,"</i> Agatha breathed, giving her own gentle squeeze to Rio's hand. <i>"But we both know that I'm not going to the best person for that."</i> She pressed her lips together, heavily weighing what she wanted to say in her mind. She knew that it could end this just as quickly as it was beginning, but she couldn't keep holding it in, couldn't keep acting like she didn't see it. <i>"Rio... I... I think you should talk to someone. Someone who's qualified to help you. I... I know that we haven't seen each other in a year. But I know you. I know you've locked that door, that you've opened it maybe once or twice in twelve months. I know that you fight the urge to cry every single time you walk by it. I know that now, you see that baby, and you want him back all over again. I know that you feel like this isn't fair, and that you shouldn't have to see me. Hell, I'm almost willing to bet money one the fact that you've fought the urge to slap me a time or two." </i>
</p><p>
  
    Agatha's lips twitched, ever so slightly, into a ghost of a smile. <i>"And I know that all of that is because you won't let yourself process it. You're still holding on... To the anger, to the pain, to the sadness. And I get it. I do. I know that you think if you let all of that go, you'll lose him, too. But you won't, Rio. He's not going anywhere. He's with you, with us, always. I mean... I know for a fact he's kept me out of trouble a time or two." </i>
</p><p>
  Her thumb brushed over the back of Rio's hand gently, her gaze never wavering from that face, that face that was filled with so much ache and so much hurt.
</p><p>
  <i>"I... just... think about it. I know bottling things up is kinda your schtick, but... You deserve to see light when you look at the sun, again, Rio."</i> Agatha's lips pressed together for a moment in a silent war within her. <i>"I am under no assumption that we're ever going to be an 'us' again, but I..."</i> She cleared her throat, clearly losing her battle to the emotion that was swelling inside of her chest. <i>"There is not going to be a day for the rest of my life where I don't still love you. You have been over half of my life, and... when I'm real with myself, we had so so many years that were filled with amazing memories. There are hundreds more good memories than there are bad ones, in all of that time."</i> The tears had started spilling, dropping out of the corners of her eyes.
</p><p>
  <i>"I know that what I did is unforgivable. I know that because I'm not sure I'll ever forgive myself for the choice I made that night. I'll never be able to let myself find any peace in not listening to you, and what happened because of it. But..."</i> she swallowed hard, squeezing her eyes shut. <i>"I only stayed away because it was what you wanted."</i>
  
</p><p>
  Agatha's chest shook softly as she began to cry harder, gripping a little tighter at Rio's hand in the middle of the bed.
</p><p>
 
      <i>"So... I need you to understand that when you ask me to stay, I... I really need you to mean it. Because if you don't, it's going to destroy me."</i>
    
</p><p>
  The absolute gravity of what Agatha had said landed squarely between them, heavy like a two ton anvil. They both opened their eyes, finding each other across that space, their fingers still woven together between them.
</p><p>
  The stillness almost had a comfort to it, one that was shattered as Agatha began to feel as Rio's fingers shifted, peeling back. At the speed of light, she could acutely feel every single place in her chest that was breaking, completely shattering. She watched helplessly as Rio pulled her hand back to herself, placing it flat on the bed.
</p><p>
  The moment the hot -- and angry -- tears began to furiously stream down Agatha's cheeks, though, Rio used that contact on top of the mattress to push herself. She rose, so painfully slowly, to a high enough position so that she could shift.
</p><p>
  Agatha stared at her, completely dumbstruck at what she was trying to understand was happening. Carefully and so fucking slowly, Rio moved, shifting on the bed, scooting herself across that canyon between them to place herself directly in front of Agatha. Without a word, she curled inward, tucking her face into Agatha's chest, pulling her arms between them.
</p><p>
  The shock was clear on Agatha's face, even though she knew she had no audience to bear witness. She still couldn't believe it, couldn't understand that this was the choice Rio was actively making. She hadn't responded once, hadn't really acknowledged anything else Agatha had said until that very last part. There were still so many unanswered questions that were looming above their heads, but in that moment?
</p><p>
  Rio wanted her there.
</p><p>
 Rio wanted to be held by her.
</p><p>
  Rio <i>wanted</i> her.
  
</p><p>
  Finally, as though Agatha had processed the event with an impossible delay, she caught back up to the moment, lifting an arm to secure it around her ex-wife, pulling her closer to her chest. She tucked her chin over Rio's head, keeping her close.
</p><p>
  There was really nothing left for her to say. She felt as though she had laid it all out on the table, had given up every last bit of what she'd had left in trying to make Rio understand her side of things. It was either going to start on an upward trajectory, or they were going to continue to careen in the darkness, but something about this felt like it could be a possibility. Something like this felt like planting a seed.
</p><p>
  It was now up to both of them to see that it got watered.
</p><p>
  Agatha knew she could do what she could, what she had been trying to do all this time, but she needed Rio to stop fighting her at every turn. She needed Rio to understand that nothing Agatha was doing was from any well of malice. She loved her, and she just wanted to make things easier.
</p><p>
 The quiet of the room and the beating of Agatha's heart had seemed to be enough to lull Rio into sleep, as her breathing had evened out and it had been a while since she had sniffled.
</p><p>
  Agatha, though?
</p><p>
  Agatha was going to spend the next two to three hours running circles around her own mind about what the fuck she was supposed to do going forward.
</p><p>
 The worst part?
  
</p><p>
She knew that by the time she exhausted herself, she'd be no closer to the answers than she was right then.

  <p>It had been two weeks.</p><p>Agatha hadn't slept in her own apartment in two weeks, and for that, Rio was thankful. It couldn't have been said that they were on the best terms, but she and Agatha both seemed to be of the idea that if they could unite in their common goal of raising Delilah, they might be able to find stable ground in the way they dealt with one another.</p><p>The first step had been to ask for help. Making the appointments for a psychological evaluation had been nerve-wracking for Rio, but having to do them over the phone would have been exponentially worse. Agatha had been patient with her, helping when she could if Rio had a question about something she didn't understand.</p><p>It had taken less than 24 hours for someone to call her back. She had made the appointment and while it had initially been about three weeks out, she was now down to mere days.</p><p>Agatha had been... Rio wasn't really sure there was a word that could accurately depict it. She had been quiet, but she had been steadfast. She showed up every single time Rio needed her to, and she did so with little reservation. In that presence, though, she was quiet. She spoke really only when Rio spoke to her first, or if she had a helpful suggestion in regard to something the baby needed.</p><p>It was almost as if Agatha were a ghost, haunting a space she did not feel that she should be occupying. Rio couldn't help but wonder if that was her fault; she had been yanking Agatha around, back and forth like she were some kind of chew toy. First, she was angry, then she remember how much she loved Agatha, and then she was hurting again and trying to push Agatha away. It was an unfair tether and Rio knew it.</p><p>Maybe Agatha was quiet because so far, when she didn't speak, they didn't typically fight. </p><p>It was strange, though, existing in the same space in a way that they were both dutifully caring for an infant, but their personal connection seemed so paper-thin. </p><p>The truth was, Rio knew that what Agatha wanted was permission to love her again. She wanted to be told that it was okay to care for her, and not just the baby. Rio didn't know how to give it, at least not yet. She told herself that therapy would help, that she could learn ways to deal with the unresolved hurt and anger that still begged to simmer inside of her when she spent too long drowning in the memories of the way life once was merely two years ago. She had to.</p><p>Agatha was proving that she could show up, she was proving that she was willing to do anything to give Delilah a good life, even if it meant sleeping on the opposite ends of a king sized bed every night. </p><p>Agatha had tried to sleep on the couch the first night, but Rio had put up a gentle fight, assuring her that it was okay that they share space, made promises that she would respect Agatha's space as well as her feelings.</p><p>As much as Rio had been trying to grin and bear it, knowing that she of all people did not have any right to demand a damn thing from Agatha, but it was almost too much to take anymore. For as twisted as her own emotions still were, she was tired of watching the shell of Agatha wander around a home that she should have felt comfortable in.</p><p>Rio had turned it into unfamiliar territory once she had shoved Agatha out of the picture. It hadn't been fair, and Rio knew that trying to blame Agatha for feeling that way would only further perpetuate the idea that she was not going to make an effort. She <em>needed</em> to prove that she was going to make an effort. </p><p>Agatha deserved that much.</p><p> It was a Monday evening and Rio's intake appointment was on Thursday.</p><p>She didn't want to wait until Thursday to cut through the tension that had been filling the space between them for over two weeks. She didn't want to let it linger on anymore. At the same time, Rio was not entirely certain that she could gauge what Agatha's response might be at any attempt to try and make peace without looking for the proper tools first.</p><p>Rio had prepared them a pot of chicken and noodles and they had sat quietly in the living room while the news played on in the background, the newscasters droning on pointlessly. Delilah was in the little bouncing carrier on the floor to Agatha's left, cooing softly as she swung her arms around trying to hit the dangling toys above her head.</p><p>"Hey," Rio voiced, leaning forward as she set her half-full bowl on the coffee table. </p><p>Agatha's gaze flickered to her for a moment and then landed back on her food as she pushed it around with her spoon. "Yeah?"</p><p>"Can we talk?" Rio offered, her voice low but dulled around the edges.</p><p>"About what?" Agatha asked, still sinking all the focus in the world into that bowl of chicken and noodles.</p><p>"About the fact that I'm not sure if you'd be more miserable here or at your apartment alone," Rio tried, immediately realizing she had not selected the right verbiage. Fuck.</p><p>"Are you saying you want me to leave?" Agatha asked back, those cold blue eyes lifting in fear. Her voice sounded tight, pinched, like she was trying to keep it from jumping six octaves.</p><p>"No, no," Rio returned quickly, though she realized that the damage might have already been done.</p><p>"I'm saying... I don't want you to be miserable when you're here," she tried to explain, but she knew she was falling short. "And... I know that I haven't been a big help. But... What can I do?"</p><p>Agatha was still watching her, looking like she was waiting for impact at the moment Rio decided she didn't actually mean what she was asking. Rio raised her brows in question, as if trying to prompt Agatha into continuing.</p><p>"That's a genuine question?" Agatha asked softly, that look on her face screaming that she was waiting for Rio to crack a vicious grin and state that it was just a joke.</p><p>Rio's lips pressed tight and she gave a gentle nod.</p><p>Finally being asked something that Agatha could have only ever dreamed of being asked again had clearly caught her off guard and she was not certain how she was supposed to answer after so long of knowing it wouldn't matter if she had an answer or not because the question would never be asked.</p><p>Agatha seemed to consider this, <em>really</em> consider it. She was still looking like she was caught and not sure how to escape, but she seemed to be really sinking thought into what it was she wanted to say. Finally, she had made her decision.</p><p>"You can tell me what it is you want." Agatha's words were firm, but they were not sharp. It was clearly little more than a request to be let in, a desire to know the real root of how it was she needed to operate. "I know that you're going to work on therapy and things this week, but... Is there any way that you can just... tell me before then?"</p><p>In those moments, seeing that broken and nervous version of Agatha, Rio felt guilty. This was what she had done. It was a direct result of the actions Rio had taken to shut out and isolate Agatha while she tried to choke down her immeasurable grief. </p><p>"I..." Rio started, but did she even have an answer? What <em>did</em> she want from Agatha? She knew that in the early hours of the morning as she laid on her side, facing away from her snoring ex wife, she wondered what it could have been like if her anger had not consumed her whole. What if she could have it again? What if she could realize the fact that while Agatha had made a choice that and caused more pain and heartache than either of them deserved to feel, she was still a human being who had made a mistake?</p><p>Rio had loved Agatha irrevocably. She had promised to spend her life making Agatha happy. Instead, she had severed those vows in her pain and for nearly a year, she hadn't thought twice about it. Being face-to-face with the person she'd hurt the most in it all -- and even the person who <em>was</em> hurting the most, regardless of Rio's own indignation -- left her unsure of how to handle <em>herself, </em> let alone how to operate in accordance with Agatha's emotions.</p><p><em>"I want to forgive you, Agatha," </em>Rio breathed, her eyes dropping down to where Delilah was still bouncing happily in the little seat, her beautiful green eyes locked on those dangling toys. </p><p>There was a heavy tension between them suddenly, one where Agatha had finally heard words that had once seemed impossible. Once she heard them, she then took a moment to understand them. She was quiet, her eyes daring over Rio's profile, not paying mind to the fact that Rio wasn't looking back at her.</p><p>
  <em>"Then why won't you?"</em>
</p><p>As much as that felt like a sword blade through the chest, Rio knew it was a fair question and one that deserved an actual answer. </p><p><em>"Because I haven't known how,"</em> she answered honestly, though she couldn't bring herself to look at Agatha. It hurt so much more when she saw that look in Agatha's eyes.</p><p><em>"Has that changed?"</em> Agatha asked and while Rio would have loved to ignore it, she could hear the hope there. It was bright, just barely, but it rang in Agatha's whispered words.</p><p>Rio's head dropped, her eyes landing on her hands as they twisted over one another in front of her. Yes, it had changed. She knew how to forgive Agatha. She had to let go. She had to stop blaming her for something that really wasn't her fault. Maybe it wouldn't have happened if Agatha would have listened, but Rio knew deep down that she wouldn't have done it if she had known what could have happened.</p><p>The fact of the matter was that no one could have predicted what had happened that night, but it had happened anyway and now, Nicky was gone. Now, Delilah was right there, needing them both to unite in a way that they might have needed just as much.</p><p>Truthfully, Rio missed Agatha. More specifically, Rio missed the Agatha that she had been married to, the one that had cussed out school officials and threatened to fight parents at baseball games. She missed the Agatha that liked taking Nicky on hikes where they would find unique flowers to bring home with them to show to Rio. She missed the Agatha that would bake Nicky a carrot cake for his birthday because it was his favorite, even if that fact alone made him a freak.</p><p>Rio missed the Agatha that didn't hate herself.</p><p>Rio had been the one to <em>make</em> Agatha hate herself by keeping her on the other side of her steel walls.</p><p>What if she tore them down?</p><p>What if she let Agatha back in?</p><p>Would Agatha stop hating herself?</p><p><em>"I don't know," </em>Rio finally admitted, her voice so low it barely reached the state of a whisper. <em>"But... I'm trying to find a way. And I..."</em> Rio stopped herself, giving her head a gentle but discouraged shake.</p><p><em>"You what, Rio?" </em>Agatha asked her, though she tore her eyes away from her ex-wife's face to glance down at their granddaughter to gauge how she was fairing.</p><p>
  <em>"I know that I love you, Agatha. But..."</em>
</p><p>Before Rio could continue, Agatha's head snapped back to her again with a quickness, her eyes wide and clearly stunned to hear Rio release such an admission in a truly soft fashion. </p><p><em>"But?" </em>Agatha pressed, her lips thin as they pressed roughly in her nerves.</p><p><em>"But every time I look at you, I think about how much I miss him. I think about how he had your smile, how close his laugh was to yours. I think about the times he would bring up some random fact about fingerprinting or blood splatter that you taught him. I think about how you were such an incredible mother and now, you're trying </em><b><em>so </em></b><em>fucking hard to be a good grandmother. And it makes that love I have for you feel differently in a way I don't know how to explain." </em>Rio's voice was quaking and trembling, but she was fighting for her life to remain strong enough to keep going.</p><p>
  <em>"But every single time I think about how much I miss you, I'm stopped by the pain I feel when I think about the fact that he's only gone because of a choice you made."</em>
</p><p>It was what Agatha had known all along; she had known that Rio had let the blame lie solely with her. Agatha knew it to be fact because she'd taken all of the blame on in her own right, as well. It had been her choice, and she had been drowning in it in the year since she'd made it.</p><p><em>"But..."</em> Rio continued before Agatha could form an exhausted rebuttal, <em>"I also know that if you could go back and make a different one, you'd sacrifice anything and everything to do it." </em>Her voice was low, hardly any louder than the television across the room. <em>"And that... That's the part I'm trying to work with. That's the part of me that's aching to find a way to just... look you in the eye and say it."</em></p><p>Rio had barely drawn in a breath by the time Agatha was shoving a stopper into the silence with her question.</p><p><em>"Say what?"</em> Agatha asked, knowing exactly what she was doing by posing such an inquiry. </p><p>Rio's dark eyes locked into those frightened and tired blues and something in her middle knotted tight and sank, her heart literally aching with each beat it executed in her chest.  Agatha was forcing her hand here, or at the very least she was presenting Rio with an opportunity to try and do something she was insistent she could not door.</p><p>She did not waver in her gaze as she began to assess her options, but first, Rio found herself struck by something in Agatha's expression. It was something she had not seen in an incredibly long time, since Nicky had been sick was he was younger: Above her left eyebrow on the most outer point, the muscle there twitched. It would pinch noticeably for a moment and then, it would smooth only to resume the spasm moments later.</p><p>It was right there, right in front of Rio's eyes; Agatha couldn't go back in time, but she could move forward with better intent and more informed decisions. She could try to do the right thing when she knew that she had done the wrong one before. </p><p>Agatha was far too stubborn to off herself, but she would also live in her pain as a form of self-inflicted punishment if it meant that it might somehow help her atone. For the first time in a year, Rio found herself wondering if it really had to be that way. What if they could lay some sort of makeshift foundation right then and there that could change the trajectory of their lives in that moment.</p><p><em>"I'll say it, and I'll mean it. But... I need something from you," </em>Rio informed her; she wasn't trying to haggle, but at the same time, what she was about to suggest seemed like a rational thought for where they were.</p><p><em>"Anything,"</em> Agatha answered, scooting forward as she placed her bowl on the table as well, shifting slightly to face Rio a bit more.</p><p><em>"I think you should talk to someone too. Someone that can help you process the guilt you still feel and the self-loathing that happened because of it. And... I don't mean that crackpot work appointed one, either," </em>Rio told her and while she was being sincere, she knew that she had to handle this carefully. She had to remember that even though she was doing a bad job of trying to rebuild the bridges that had been burnt between them, she was still trying and she could prove as much. </p><p>Something in Agatha's eyes darkened for the briefest moment, but it disappeared as quickly as it had arrived. Rio could almost see that she wanted to insist she was fine, but they both knew that to be an absolute lie. She was living as a ghost in a home that used to be theirs and she deserved to feel what it was to be alive again. Agatha deserved to know light and warmth once more. She had been trying to find it in Delilah, Rio could tell, but what if they could all find it together?</p><p>Agatha's head dropped for a few long moments while she weighed her options. After gathering what resolve she could, she picked it back up and met Rio's gaze.</p><p>
  <em>"Okay."</em>
</p><p>Rio blinked at her ex-wife, stunned by such an easy surrender.</p><p><em>"R-Really?" </em>she stammered back, almost afraid Agatha might immediately change her mind. </p><p>Agatha's lips twisted, considering. It wasn't that she was contemplating the answer she had provided, but instead of debating on adding an addendum. </p><p><em>"You can say it... Whatever it is,"</em> Rio tried to coax, her tone soft but still sweet and reassuring. </p><p>
  <em>"What if we looked into... I mean, obviously not marriage counseling but like... Couples therapy, too?"</em>
</p><p>Agatha clearly meant what she was suggesting, judging by that stoic look on her face and she resolve she was trying to force into her words, but something more about it struck Rio. It was the fact that Agatha was making a very clear statement that she wanted them to at least <em>try</em> to work on something moving forward.</p><p>What Agatha was saying without using so many words was that she'd never stopped loving Rio and would do anything it took to make that known.</p><p> Rio gave the smallest nod of agreement, her lips pressed into a thin and tight line. </p><p><em>"We do both. And... And we just... Like everything else, we take it a day at a time." </em>Rio might have sounded resolved, but there were still so many unanswered questions that were pinging off the insides of her skull. Agatha seemed to notice without missing a beat.</p><p><em>"If you don't want this..."</em> she started, but Rio was already shaking her head.</p><p>
  <em>"I do, Agatha, or I wouldn't have agreed. I... I will always love you, and I..."</em>
</p><p>Agatha's breath hitched, stilling somewhere near the very base of her throat as she seemed to know what it was that Rio was going to say. </p><p>The tears had already started to well at the edges of Rio's lids, but she knew she had to say it. She knew that she had to breathe those words aloud not only for Agatha to hear them, but because Rio herself needed to hear them as well. It was honest, but it was still also impossibly scared as it left her lips.</p><p>
  <em>"I forgive you."</em>
</p><p>In an instant, there was a mirrored look of shock between them, as though neither of them could truly believe that Rio had actually said something so heavy out loud. Maybe it was premature, maybe it was what was needed. It didn't matter what it actually was, because she had done it anyway and it was exactly what Agatha had needed to hear.</p><p>She was quiet, just watching Rio for a moment before she chose her next words very carefully.</p><p><em>"If you say no, I respect that, but can I... Can I hug you?" </em>Agatha asked her softly. <em>''I just... Please?"</em></p><p>Agatha Harkness did not beg.</p><p>She did not plead.</p><p>But right then, it was clear that an embrace from her ex-wife might be the one thing that could float her through the very arduous journey to healing they were promising one another to undertake. </p><p>So, Rio stood up.</p><p>Agatha mimicked the action and while she did not look like she was about to immediately fall to pieces, the moment Rio stepped forward and wrapped Agatha in her arms, she could still feel it all the same. </p><p>Rio's arms tightened around Agatha's torso, pulling her close as Agatha's own grasp encircled Rio's waist, her head falling to Rio's shoulder.  Agatha did not cry, she did not tremble. All Agatha did right then was cling tighter, hold Rio closer, as if she were finally seeing the light after far too many days of darkness to count. </p><p>Making an offer such as this was not something that Rio was taking lightly, not something she was trying to use to her advantage. No, her effort in trying to restore what had once been something <em>so </em>great and <em>so</em> full of love could provide a great deal to Rio's life, as it had all those years ago. Rio had loved Agatha without question, but the only end that had come to it had been brought about by nothing more than the anguish of grief and pain.</p><p>As she stood there, realizing that she and Delilah were the only two things keeping Agatha together, Rio knew that if she could find a way to truly process her feelings and understand how to cope with those painful feelings, she could find a way to live again. More than that, they could both learn to love again in ways that had not felt safe to permit since everything that had happened. </p><p>Rio drew in a slow breath, one hand raising to cradle the back of Agatha's head carefully, holding her close with measured tenderness. What she was going to say was something that she meant with every bit of who she was in the moment, but some part of her wondered if she might come to regret voicing it aloud so soon.</p><p><em>"I love you, Agatha," </em>Rio released in the quietest, most broken whimper as the tears finally spilled down her cheeks without restraint. </p><p>Agatha remained quiet, but Rio felt it: the tremble was instant and she could feel the hot puff of air Agatha exhaled against her neck as the words sank in.</p><p><em>"Do you mean it?"</em> she asked back unevenly.</p><p>
  <em>"I do."</em>
</p><p>
  <em>"I love you, too, Rio."</em>
</p><p>Rio's fingertips had started to drag through Agatha's hair as she contemplated her next words, knowing that the horse was already before the cart right then.</p><p>
  <em>"Maybe it might just be enough to see us through."</em>
