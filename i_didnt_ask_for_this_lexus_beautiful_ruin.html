<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Rio Vidal, self-made millionaire, is a partier with a bad drug and alcohol habit. She is saddled with custody of her niece Valentina when her brother and his wife pass away unexpectedly. She hasn't spoken to her family for 15 years and wants nothing to do with the 17-year-old on her doorstep.</p>
<p>Agatha Harkness is a struggling single parent to teenage son Nicky. She works two jobs to make ends meet and still always makes time for her son. When he befriends a new girl at school with some behavioral challenges and asks for her help, Agatha lets the girl into her home and picks up Rio's slack caring for her. She doesn't mind being a de facto guardian, but if there's one thing she's determined about, it's to talk (or knock) some sense into Rio Vidal.</p>
<p>Rio is three Negronis in when her phone rings, and she can barely hear it over the pulsing music of the club; barely feel it over the bass pounding in her chest. “Yeah?” she shouts, putting the phone to her ear.</p>
<p>It’s somebody saying she’s inherited a kid. Her niece or something. Yeah, right.</p>
<p>“Okay, good one buddy. Sure, whatever.”</p>
<p>And she hangs up.</p>
<p>Orders another drink.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notes</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Hello fam! I bring you yet another Agathario AU. Please note trigger warnings for graphic drug use and child neglect. (Valentina is 17 and gets her needs met at Nicky and Agatha's house but Rio is still very much neglectful and this could be triggering.)</p>
<p>Please also note the dubcon tag. Some of the interactions between Agatha and Rio are most decidedly dubcon in nature, whether due to Rio's lack of clarity and sobriety or due to her Pavlovian response to Agatha's tie, which Agatha very much uses to her advantage.</p>
<p>If none of that scares you off, please enjoy the ride!</p></blockquote>

      Chapter 1: Rio
  </h2>
</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p><em>Rio Vidal, Self-Made Millionaire</em></p><p>That’s what the headlines say about her. That she built her businesses from the ground up, with no help from anyone. It’s true enough.</p><p>Vogue Magazine did a spread on her last month, and she has the article open on her coffee table while she kneels next to it and snorts a line from her own gloss-printed bare stomach.</p><p>She drops the hollowed-out pen shaft and leans back against the sofa, keeping one side of her nose plugged as she sniffs a few times, eyes watering at the burn. “Fuck, that’s good,” she says to the small crowd gathered in her living room, and tips her head to stare at the ceiling.</p><p>She gags a little at the drain, never quite used to it, but the feeling of bliss spreading through her body and crossing the blood-brain barrier erases any irritation.</p><p>“Who’s next?”</p><p>She pays no attention to whichever acquaintance picks up the pen shaft. They’re a dime a dozen, the people who attend her parties. No one is ever very interesting. No one catches her focus. But she’s friendly, because they bring drugs and booze and compliment her house and her clothes and tell her how pretty she is.</p><p>She loves being complimented, and especially loves being told how pretty she is. In fact, if she could, she would make that the only thing other people were allowed to say.</p><p>She gets lost in that fantasy, imagining a world where no one speaks except to compliment her, and a laugh tumbles out.</p><p>The next thing she knows, she’s on her back on the sofa, letting one of the party guests in her panties. It’s nice, if boring, and then she wakes up sprawled face down in the kitchen, sunlight filtering in through the windows to warm the back of her head.</p><p>“Ugh, why am I in the fucking kitchen?” she mutters, her awareness expanding to the puddle of drool her cheek is resting in. “Oh, gross. Come <em>on</em>.”</p><p>She hopes she’s alone. She vaguely recalls kicking everyone out, but has no memory of whether they’d actually left.</p><p>She pushes to her hands and knees, gets to her feet with a groan, and wipes her face on the towel hanging from the refrigerator door. Her head is pounding and she’s out of the good pain pills, so she swipes her best bottle of vodka from the counter and takes a swig.</p><p>Now, to make sure her house is empty.</p><p>It’s not.</p><p>There’s one guy passed out half on the sofa and half on the floor.</p><p>“Hey,” she barks, kicking him in the leg until he stirs. “Hey. Get the fuck out.”</p><p>He falls off the sofa with a thud and scrambles to get up, not even bothering to say anything as he staggers out the door.</p><p>Rio huffs and slams it and locks it. “There better not be anyone else in here!” she yells through the house.</p><p>No response. Good. She can go back to bed.</p><p>--</p><p>Rio is three Negronis in when her phone rings, and she can barely hear it over the pulsing music of the club; barely feel it over the bass pounding in her chest. “Yeah?” she shouts, putting the phone to her ear.</p><p>It’s somebody saying she’s inherited a kid. Her niece or something. Yeah, right.</p><p>“Okay, good one buddy. Sure, whatever.”</p><p>And she hangs up.</p><p>Orders another drink.</p><p>Gets lost in the crowd, dancing with a nameless stranger, expensive perfume strangling her and rough hands on her waist, guiding her through the song.</p><p>She loves nights like this. Expensive dresses clinging to her skin, jewelry dazzling enough to blind in better lighting hanging around her neck and pierced through her ears.</p><p>But nobody knows her in a club like this. She stands out for her taste and beauty, not the words written about her in the latest lifestyle magazine. No one knows her name, and she doesn’t tell. Doesn’t leave with anyone. Doesn’t take anyone with her when she leaves.</p><p>She usually stumbles into her waiting towncar when she’s had enough, and her driver takes her home. Tonight is no different.</p><p>She kicks off her shoes as she enters the house, drops her purse on the entry table, locks the door, and passes out on the couch.</p><p>Her sleep is disturbed by a pounding in her head. She jerks awake and realizes it’s someone knocking on the door. It takes her a few minutes to get up and answer it, and she’s furious as she yanks it open, cursing whoever’s on the other side. “What the fuck do you—”</p><p>It’s a kid. Well, a teenager. And behind her, some guy in a suit.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal? I’m Robert Walker, we spoke on the phone last night.”</p><p>The world is spinning and the contents of her stomach are threatening to emerge. She gags and leans over, holding up a finger to indicate the man should wait a minute.</p><p>The nausea rolls through and passes without incident, and she slowly straightens with a shudder. “I’m not sure who you are, but this is far from funny. My attorney will—”</p><p>“I told you she wouldn’t want me,” the kid interrupts, looking at the suit.</p><p>“Who <em>are</em> you?” Rio asks, leaning a hand on the door frame for support. It’s too damn early for this.</p><p>“Valentina,” the kid says.</p><p>Valentina, Valentina… the name rings a distant bell, but—oh holy Jesus. This is actually her niece. Her brother and his cunt of a wife’s kid. “What the fuck are you doing here? How do you even know where I live?” She hasn’t spoken to any of her family in years. Probably fifteen years.</p><p>“The probate clerk looked up your address,” the suit says. “Could we talk in private for a minute, please?”</p><p>Valentina rolls her eyes and pushes past Rio to go flop on the sofa.</p><p>Rio narrows hers, first at the kid, then at the suit. “If you don’t explain yourself—”</p><p>“Like I said on the phone, Ms. Vidal, her parents left instructions in their will for you to be granted custody of Valentina upon their deaths, and—”</p><p>“What the fuck?” Rio shouts. “Me? Custody of a child? Do I look like I’m about to take custody of a fucking child?” And the other thing registers a second later. “My brother’s dead?”</p><p>“Yes, Ms. Vidal, and you have my condolences. Valentina is seventeen, she will only need to stay with you legally until her eighteenth birthday, and then the two of you can decide what to do from there. She’s been enrolled in the local high school and starts tomorrow. Her possessions will be arriving later today. I hope everything works out.”</p><p>He nods and turns to leave, and she frantically grabs the back of his collar, stepping out onto the porch. “You can’t leave her here!” she hisses.</p><p>He makes a surprised sort of noise and extracts his collar from her fist, brushes his hands on his pants and walks quickly away without looking back.</p><p>“Oh my God,” she says, turning to go back in the house. Her life is fucking ruined.</p><p>She goes straight up the stairs to her bedroom, pops a sleeping pill, and is dead to the world in less than twenty minutes.</p><p>--</p><p>Rio wakes up in the afternoon, groggy and grumpy from having her morning disturbed, and wanders down the stairs, hoping her niece found other arrangements while she slept.</p><p>No such luck. The girl is still slouched on her sofa, eyes glued to the screen of her cell phone.</p><p>When she hears Rio on the stairs, she looks up and points at the coffee table. “Are those drugs?”</p><p>Rio opts out of answering that, continuing past her toward the kitchen. “I’m just going to pretend you aren’t here,” she says, and opens the refrigerator.</p><p>“Cool. Then you won’t mind if I take a few of these hundreds,” Valentina says.</p><p>“I honestly don’t care what you do,” Rio responds carelessly, searching for something to eat that won’t curdle her stomach.</p><p>There’s nothing, so she goes back to the living room and fishes her phone from her purse on the entry table, and orders a salad. When she puts it away, her niece is staring at her.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Did you just order food?”</p><p>“I ordered a salad. Why do you care?”</p><p>“Because I’m hungry?” Valentina says, eyebrows raised.</p><p>“You just took a few hundred dollars off my coffee table. Buy yourself something to eat.”</p><p>“My mom was right about you,” the kid says, shaking her head.</p><p>The hair on the back of Rio’s neck stands up and a chill seeps into her bones. “What the fuck did you just say?” Her voice is low. Angry. Offended.</p><p>Valentina gets up. Stands in her space. “I said, my mom was right about you, <em>Auntie</em> Rio. All the money in the world can’t buy you class. You’re nothing but a junkie whore.”</p><p>Rio wobbles on her feet a little when balance becomes an issue, and squints at her niece. “Your mother—”</p><p>“Is dead!” Valentina screams. “And you don’t give a god damn fuck! I don’t want to be here any more than you want me here! I fucking hate you!”</p><p>Rio stands there with a finger ready to point at the kid, but she’s too slow, and Valentina storms out the door. She slams it so loud it kickstarts the headache Rio thought she would’ve woken up with.</p>

      Chapter 2: Agatha

<p>Chapter Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In which we meet Agatha and Nicky. Nicky befriends Valentina. Rio mistakes Agatha for a stripper and Agatha discovers Rio's humiliation kink.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Mom?”</p><p>Agatha Harkness glances at the kitchen table as she slops peanut butter onto bread in a hurry. “Yeah?”</p><p>Nicky has that look on his face that means he wants her help with something and he doesn’t know if she’s going to agree to it.</p><p>“There’s this new girl at my school, and she’s only been there three days and she’s gotten sent home every single day, even before lunch,” he starts, his tone inflecting upward at the end so she knows he’s not finished.</p><p>“Mhmm…?” She slops jelly on the other piece of bread and folds them together, using one hand to hold the sandwich and the other to open a drawer for a baggie since she hadn’t planned ahead and had one out already.</p><p>“And, well… I feel really bad for her because her parents died and she got shipped off here to live with her aunt Rio, and—”</p><p>“Rio Vidal?” Agatha interrupts.</p><p>“Yeah, from the magazines,” Nicky says. “And—”</p><p>“Oh God,” Agatha says, grimacing.</p><p>“Yeah, I know,” Nicky says.</p><p>Rio Vidal’s exploits are well known among anyone business minded or anyone who reads Cosmo. She’s always got a drink in her hand in photos, and her eyes never quite match the situations she’s photographed in. Agatha remembers seeing her picture and thinking she was hot, but hot mess was more like it.</p><p>“And she just pretends like Valentina isn’t even there, and mom, she <em>cried</em> about her parents yesterday before she set a fire in the girls’ bathroom so she could get sent home, and I just, I thought maybe…”</p><p>Agatha puts the sandwich into the baggie and zips the closure, then walks over to the table and kisses her son on the top of his perfect head. “Sure baby. Invite her over.”</p><p>He heaves the biggest sigh of relief, and Agatha is struck once again at what an amazing young man he’s turned into. Always thinking of others and trying to help anyone that needs it. “Is that sandwich for me?” he asks after a second, eyeing the bag in her hand suspiciously.</p><p>“You hate peanut butter and jelly,” Agatha says. “Your lunch is in the fridge, complete with turkey sandwich, carrots and ranch, a bag of chips and a soda. Because we ran out of water bottles and I haven’t had time to get to the store.”</p><p>“I can go to the store if you give me money,” he offers, skulking over to the fridge to grab his lunch just as they hear a horn outside.</p><p>“Thanks hon, but I’ll go today,” Agatha promises. “Just enjoy your soda.”</p><p>“Oh believe me, I will.”</p><p>She could’ve filled up an empty bottle with water from the tap, but she likes to spoil him every once in a while. He deserves it. “Have a good day baby, I love you,” she says as he heads out to the bus.</p><p>“Love you too!” he says, shutting the door behind him, and she watches out the window as he walks across the lawn and jumps up onto the bus when the doors open.</p><p>Time for job number one.</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha gets home well after eight o’clock, but she’s got pizza with her as an apology for having to work late. “Hey baby I hope you’re hungry!” she calls, slipping off her shoes by the door and heading for the kitchen.</p><p>She stops short when she sees Nicky and presumably Valentina on the sofa playing some horrifically violent video game. He’s got his headset on and she’s got his spare one, so Agatha realizes drastic measures must be taken. She creeps to the kitchen and sets the box down on the counter, takes out one piece of pizza, and creeps back to the living room, holding the pizza as close to Nicky as possible without touching him until he smells it and rips off his headset, jumping up and spinning around.</p><p>“Mom!” he shrieks. “What the heck!”</p><p>The girl notices and takes off her headset as well, and stands up quickly. “I can go now if—”</p><p>“There’s pizza,” Agatha interrupts before Valentina can conclude she’s not welcome to stay. “Just cheese I’m afraid, because pepperoni is too spicy for my delicate son.”</p><p>“Mooooom.”</p><p>Valentina smiles and nods her head. “Thank you Mrs. Harkness, are you sure it’s okay?”</p><p>“Ms. Harkness, but you can call me Agatha, and yes, I’m sure. Nicky told me your name is Valentina?”</p><p>“He calls me Vee. You can call me that too if you want,” she says, shoving her hands in her pockets and rocking on the balls of her feet.</p><p>“Vee,” Agatha says with a grin. “I like it. Okay go eat before it gets cold,” she then says to them both.</p><p>They shuffle off into the kitchen and she follows a minute later, flopping into a chair with her rogue piece of pizza, not caring about manners or plates or napkins, taking a bite and chewing with a moan of appreciation.</p><p>“Mom, oh my God,” Nicky says, his face beet red.</p><p>Valentina snickers and nudges him. “Shut up, she’s cool.”</p><p>“See?” Agatha says, nodding toward Valentina. “Vee says I’m cool. Shut up.”</p><p>Nicky groans and shoves half a slice into his mouth, chomping noisily.</p><p>“I can’t believe Rio Vidal is your aunt,” Agatha says when she finishes her slice and gets up to go grab another.</p><p>“She is the worst human,” Valentina says. “You know her?”</p><p>“I’ve seen her photo in magazines,” Agatha says. “I know of her. I’m sorry you got shipped off to live with her. Are you… is it livable there?”</p><p>“I took some of her drug money and bought a lock for the bedroom I found for myself because she has parties all hours of the night, and she doesn’t keep any food in the house, she orders out and doesn’t get me anything, the coffee table is like… the ABCs of pharmaceutical nightmarism, she takes sleeping pills and doesn’t wake up to take me to school so I have to take a cab, but I have a room that I claimed and she hasn’t gotten rid of any of my stuff, and there’s a functioning bathroom in the room I picked, so… I guess the answer is… halfway?”</p><p>Agatha’s blood runs cold as she listens, and then it heats to boiling. She drops her second piece of pizza back into the box and folds her hands in front of her to keep them from shaking. “I’m going to need her address,” she says as calmly as she can muster for the kids’ benefit. “You two stay here.”</p><p>Valentina’s eyes go wide, and Agatha can see the excitement behind them. “Are you gonna pop off?”</p><p>“Oh, I am going to pop off,” Agatha says, flexing her fingers. She’s already heading for the door. “Nicky, text me the address. Don’t wait up.”</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha loosens her tie because she feels like it’s strangling her, and wishes she’d changed into something more comfortable for this confrontation, but oh well, live and learn. She cracks her neck as she walks up the driveway and to the front door, knocking sharply.</p><p>She can hear music from inside the house, a commotion, and then the door swings inward to reveal the hot mess that is Rio Vidal.</p><p>Big brown eyes with dilated pupils rake up and down her body, wicked tongue pressed to Rio’s cheek before she turns and yells over her shoulder into the house, “Who ordered a stripper?” Before she can say or do anything, Rio turns back around and grabs her by the tie, dragging her into the house. “I don’t care who ordered you, actually, you’re mine first.”</p><p>She’s seething with anger, but realizes it’s probably the best opportunity to get Rio alone, so when she’s pulled toward the living room, she whispers hotly, “Uh-uh, sugar. One at a time. Take me to a bedroom.”</p><p>Rio veers off in another direction, wrapping the tie around her hand once to hold it tighter. “I like you already. You’re the most interesting person I’ve met all night.” Her words are slow and some of them slurred.</p><p>Agatha might be pissed off, but she’s only human, and Rio is goddamn fucking hot and literally dragging her through the house, and she’s wet by the time they end up in an opulent guest room with the door shut.</p><p>“Funny you should say that, because you’re not very interesting at all,” Agatha says in her sultry stripper voice, slipping her tie over her head and laying a hand on Rio’s chest, shoving her backward onto the bed.</p><p>Rio lands on her elbows, a pout gracing her flawless face, the tie still clutched in one hand. “That’s not very nice,” she says, eyelids fluttering.</p><p>Agatha paints on a condescending grin and leans forward to tap Rio on the nose. “Well now, <em>you’re</em> not very nice, are you?”</p><p>“I’ll give you an extra grand to stop talking,” Rio slurs, bouncing her fancy heels against the bed frame and widening her knees so Agatha can almost see under her dress.</p><p>Fuck, she’s weak for a woman’s pussy… she didn’t anticipate having to fight these particular urges tonight. Time to end this. She stands between Rio’s knees and bends over, hands flanking bare shoulders, and looks into those glassy brown eyes. “You’re pathetic,” she hisses quietly.</p><p>The outrage she anticipates doesn’t come. In fact, Rio’s mouth falls open with a gasp, and she shifts on the bed beneath Agatha.</p><p>Oh. <em>Oh</em>. Rio <em>liked</em> that. Oh, fuck. Might as well double down and say what she came here to say, even if it’s not exactly the way she pictured saying it. “You disgust me,” she continues, a sneer on her face now. “Sitting here in your mansion, snorting in one day what good working people would spend on food for a month. You’re like a fucking disease, infecting everyone around you.”</p><p>Rio’s head tips back and her breathing kicks up. “What kind of stripper are you?” she asks in awe.</p><p>“The kind that knows a waste of space when she sees one,” Agatha says. “That’s what you are, isn’t it, Rio? A drug-addled waste of fucking space.”</p><p>Agatha can see the muscles in her throat constrict as she swallows hard.</p><p>And then Rio nods. She fucking <em>nods</em>.</p><p>What is Agatha supposed to do with that? Now she’s not only angry, she’s so turned on that her clit is aching. But this is not happening. It’s just not.</p><p>“I bet you’re about to come in your panties, hearing the truth that no one else will tell you. How pathetic you are. Spread out for a lowly stripper you tried to pay literal hush money, flushed and panting, desperate for it. So fucking wet you’ll have to hire someone to change the sheets because you probably don’t know how to do it yourself.”</p><p>Rio whimpers, and Agatha has to get out of here before this train derails any further.</p><p>“Please.” It’s quiet. And yes, it’s desperate.</p><p>“You couldn’t pay me enough to touch a self-centered slut like you,” Agatha bites out, and before she can do something she’ll truly regret, she stands up and walks out the door.</p><p>Rio doesn’t follow, and she’s back in her car in about forty-five seconds, heart in her throat, pulse roaring in her ears, and she slams her hands on the steering wheel repeatedly. “FUCK!”</p><p>--</p><p>She hopes the kids are asleep when she gets home, but it’s not that late so she probably won’t be so lucky.</p><p>Not lucky at all… they’re both pulling open the front door before she even reaches it.</p><p>“What happened?” Nicky asks.</p><p>“Did you tell her off?” Valentina adds. “Hit her maybe?”</p><p>“I told her off, I didn’t hit her,” Agatha says, stepping into the house and slipping off her shoes. She hangs up her keys and drops her purse, and she’s angry and annoyed and hungry.</p><p>“What did she say?”</p><p>Ffffff. “Not much, I’m afraid. I think she was too high to really understand the situation.”</p><p>Valentina grunts. “Yeah. That tracks.”</p><p>“Where’s your tie?” Nicky asks.</p><p>Agatha slaps a hand over her chest where the tie should be, and as she remembers where it is, she prays her panic doesn’t show on her face. “Oh, I took it off in the car. It was too tight,” she says, because she’s not about to tell either of them anything about what happened.</p><p>“The suit looks weird without it.”</p><p>“Thank you, my son.” She turns to Valentina. “You can stay the night here and I’ll try to have a more productive conversation with her tomorrow. Maybe if it’s before five she won’t be trashed.”</p><p>“She doesn’t function on society’s clock. She’s always trashed.”</p><p>Agatha frowns and grabs a piece of pizza, not even caring that it’s cold. “How unfortunate.”</p><p>“Yep. But thank you for trying, and for letting me stay.”</p><p>“Of course, hon. Help yourself to anything in the kitchen. I’ll get you some sheets and blankets and a pillow. Is the sofa okay?”</p><p>“Yeah, of course. Or the floor in Nicky’s room.”</p><p>Agatha sort of grimaces. “I’d prefer the sofa, but I won’t insist.”</p><p>“Oh, you mean because you think…”</p><p>“MOM!” Nicky shouts, face resembling a tomato. “We aren’t doing that!”</p><p>Agatha holds her hands up in surrender but can’t help taking one last jab. “Fine, fine. I just can’t afford to have a bunch of baby NickyVees running around all of a sudden.”</p><p>“AHHHHHH!” Nicky explodes at her and stomps off to his room.</p><p>Valentina snorts with laughter. “He’s so easy to embarrass. I feel almost bad for him.”</p><p>“Not me, it’s my number one joy in life."</p><p>She’ll apologize to him later. Maybe.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>By the time Rio is able to get her bearings enough to sit up, the stripper’s gone. What the actual fuck? What—she needs to know who ordered that woman and from where.</p><p>She staggers to her feet, leaning on the bedpost for support, and fumbles her way out to the living room. The world is still spinning, making her head pound, and she sees two faces for every one. She blinks and shakes her head to clear it, but nothing changes. “Who ordered that stripper?” she demands.</p><p>She can’t see anyone’s eyes but it feels like they all turned to look at her.</p><p>“What stripper?”</p><p>“Not me.”</p><p>“I don’t think anyone ordered a stripper.”</p><p>Rio’s head feels like it’s about to split in half. “Not a single person in this house called and ordered a stripper?”</p><p>Blurred movement would indicate shaking heads.</p><p>“Who the fuck was that woman, then?”</p><p>More blurred movement.</p><p>So Rio has just dragged a literal stranger through her house, assuming the woman was a stripper, when she most likely was not, and the woman let her believe that, for what? Was she just… a prostitute at the wrong house? A pissed off neighbor? An undercover cop?</p><p>“What’s that?” someone asks.</p><p>“What’s what?” Rio snaps.</p><p>“In your hand.”</p><p>Rio looks down, squinting, trying to make out what she’s holding, when she realizes she doesn’t need to see it to know what it is. She’s still holding the woman’s fucking tie.</p><p>So maybe it was Cinder-fucking-ella.</p><p>“Everyone get out,” she says, her tone brooking no argument. Anyone who’s anyone knows that when Rio Vidal says the words ‘get out’, the party is officially over.</p><p>There’s much grumbling and under-the-breath complaining, but she sees all of the blurred figures get up and file out the door, then locks it behind them and flops face first onto the sofa.</p><p>It feels better to lay down, but she’s still nauseated and dizzy, and the stark memory of the woman’s disdainful words still echoes in her ears.</p><p><em>You’re pathetic.</em></p><p>She turns her head to the side because she can’t breathe with her face in the cushion.</p><p><em>You’re like a fucking disease, infecting everyone around you.</em></p><p>Maybe she is. She pulls up her dress.</p><p><em>A waste of space. That’s what you are, isn’t it, Rio?</em></p><p>“Yes,” she whispers to the memory, stretches the tie across her mouth and bites down on it. She can smell the woman’s scent lingering on the fabric and feels it flare her nostrils. No one should be allowed to smell that good.</p><p><em>Hire someone to change the sheets because you probably don’t know how to do it yourself.</em></p><p>She shoves one hand underneath her and inside her five-hundred-dollar panties, replaying the woman’s words over and over, and ruts against the sofa cushion until she comes apart, teeth gritted on that goddamn fucking tie.</p><p>--</p><p>Rio doesn’t usually dream. Or at least she doesn’t remember her dreams. But that night she dreams vividly of wild hair and sharp wit and blue eyes. Of going sailing with the woman, sitting on the deck while the woman takes them further and further from shore. Wondering whether she’s going to be tossed over the side to the sharks circling beneath the surface of the crisp, cool water when they get out far enough. Or maybe she’ll be treated to more of the woman’s vocal disdain, laid out on the bow and taken apart piece by piece.</p><p>She wakes up the next morning with a gasp, the dreams assaulting her waking psyche and leaving her trembling, unsure which way is up.</p><p>She doesn’t dream. Rio Vidal, self-made millionaire, doesn’t dream.</p><p>Except maybe that’s just because she’s never met anyone she wanted to dream about.</p><p>Until now.</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>She needs a shower. Badly. She feels her way to the kitchen, to her hangover drawer, takes a mouthful of water from the tap, and throws back a handful of pills.</p><p>She turns the shower on so hot it burns her skin, trying to wash away the images from her dreams. The memory of getting herself off with the woman’s tie in her mouth. It’s shameful to be so affected by a stranger. Rutting like a bitch in heat to the smell of her and the echoes of degradation she’d uttered as she had Rio pinned beneath her.</p><p>It’s not helping. She rests her forehead on the shower wall, hoping the contrast of soft scalding water and cold hard tile will kickstart her brain into being who she’s supposed to be.</p><p>Untouchable.</p><p>She emerges feeling more like a drowned rat than an affluent businesswoman, and the shrill ringing of her cell phone irritates her to no end.</p><p>“What?” she snaps into it.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal? This is Principal Rooks from your daughter’s high school.”</p><p>“She’s not my daughter,” Rio says, voice dripping with acid. How dare he.</p><p>“I beg your pardon, your niece,” he says.</p><p>“Okay,” she says. And when he doesn’t say anything else right away she adds, “What do you want? I’m busy.”</p><p>He clears his throat. “Ms. Vidal, I’ve been trying to reach you for several days.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And we need you to come down to the school. Today.”</p><p>“For what?”</p><p>“Your niece has been sent home every day since she started school here. Are you not aware?”</p><p>“Of course I’m aware,” she lies. “What about it?”</p><p>“We need to meet and make a plan to help her settle in to the school year.”</p><p>“Why can’t you just do that?”</p><p>“Because you’re her legal guardian, and whatever plan we come up with here, you’ll need to be enforcing at home.”</p><p>“She’s seventeen, why don’t you just let her do what she wants? That sounds like a lot of effort and frankly I’m not interested.”</p><p>He clears his throat again and she wonders if he’s thirsty or just noisy. “I’m sorry Ms. Vidal, but if we can’t get you down to the school today we’ll have to involve the police.”</p><p>“What the fuck? Ugh! Fine, I’ll come.” She hangs up and storms up the stairs to get dressed. She puts on a halter-style floor-length dress and heels, and scrubs the hell out of her teeth because her mouth tastes like fucking death, throws her hair up haphazardly, sniffs a fat line, and at the last minute on her way out the door she grabs the devil’s tie and slips it on over her head.</p><p>A glance in the rearview as she backs out of her driveway – yeah, she drives once in awhile – reveals smeared makeup racoon style, or maybe Amazon warrior style, but who cares? It’s just a school. She’s not going to any effort for these fucks. And it makes her look like a sexy hot mess anyway. She’s into it.</p><p>She has no idea where the office is so she snags a passing student by the sleeve and makes him direct her there. When she pushes open the door and steps in, she’s met with a smiling woman wearing a godawful shade of peach lipstick. “That color makes you look washed out,” she says instantly. “You should wear red.”</p><p>The woman’s smile falters for a split second before it’s plastered back on. “And what can I do for you, ma’am?”</p><p>“Ugh, don’t call me ma’am for starters. Do I look old to you? I’m here to see the principal.”</p><p>“Which one? Principal Rooks or Principal Harding?”</p><p>Rio stares. “Why do you have two?”</p><p>“We have a lot of students. Which one are you here to see?”</p><p>“I don’t care.”</p><p>“Do you have an appointment?”</p><p>“The school called and told me I had to come.”</p><p>“Okay, have a seat and let me just find out for you.”</p><p>Rio leans on the counter instead and busies herself playing with paper clips.</p><p>The woman turns away and cups her hand over her mouth but Rio can still hear what she says.</p><p>“There’s a… woman… here claiming she got a call and was told to come down?”</p><p>Why the pause before ‘woman’? “What, do you think I’m not old enough to be considered a woman?” she says when the secretary hangs up. “First I’m ma’am and now I’m too young?”</p><p>The secretary’s cheeks flush and she points behind her. “Principal Rooks will see you now.”</p><p>“Can’t wait,” Rio mutters and pushes open the swinging divider to head in the direction she’s been pointed in.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal,” he says, extending a hand when she reaches his office.</p><p>“That’s as bad as ma’am. Just call me Rio,” she says, slouching into a chair across from his desk without shaking his hand.</p><p>“Valentina is on her way down.”</p><p>“Awesome.”</p><p>They sit in awkward silence for about three minutes and then her niece appears in the doorway, who immediately scowls at her.</p><p>“Oh, it’s <em>you</em>. I was hoping it would be Agatha.”</p><p>“Who the fuck is Agatha and why would she be at this… guardian conference thing?”</p><p>“What do you mean who’s Agatha? She’s my friend’s mom. You met her last night. You’re wearing her fucking tie.”</p><p>Rio’s brain seizes. Her jaw goes slack, her blood heats up, her heart starts to race. “What?” A hand closes protectively around the tie as if she can make it not be true.</p><p>“Ha!” Valentina barks out a laugh. “You’re blushing. Why are you blushing, <em>Auntie</em> Rio?”</p><p>The familial term is tossed at her like a slur. Still she can’t find words. Still she can’t find breath. Still she can’t find clarity.</p><p>“Valentina, would you please have a seat?” the principal interrupts at last, motioning toward the other chair.</p><p>Valentina sits with one foot up on the chair, knee bent, and the other foot on the floor.</p><p>Rio tries to listen when the principal starts talking, but visions of the previous night won’t leave her alone.</p><p>“So, I called this meeting in the hopes of motivating Valentina to do some school work and—” Untamed hair. “—because we really want to make it as easy as possible for you to succeed, Valent—” Heated blue gaze. “—property destruction and disrespect, and—” <em>You’re pathetic</em>. “—sound agreeable to you both?”</p><p>Rio blinks herself out of it and sits up straighter, letting go of the tie. “Could you repeat that?”</p><p>“Are you fucking kidding?” Valentina snipes.</p><p>“I have a fucking headache!” Rio snipes back.</p><p>“It’s not a problem,” the principal says. “Valentina hasn’t done any of her school work and we were hoping you might have some suggestions on how to motivate her to participate in her education.”</p><p>“This should be good. She doesn’t even know I exist, she won’t have one goddamn idea how to motivate me.”</p><p>“Money,” Rio blurts.</p><p>And to her surprise, Valentina stops antagonizing her. “Yeah, okay. That’ll work.”</p><p>“If that’s what you both think is best,” the principal says, clearly willing to try anything. Because even Rio knows that money isn’t something you should offer a kid to do their school work. “There is also the matter of the fires she’s been setting in the girls’ bathrooms.”</p><p>Rio’s head snaps toward her niece. “You hear that? Stop setting fucking fires.”</p><p>Valentina rolls her eyes.</p><p>“So, uh, Ms. Vidal—Rio—maybe you could make sure that Valentina doesn’t come to school carrying a lighter?”</p><p>“She touches me she loses a hand,” Valentina growls.</p><p>Rio glares at her. “You want your money? Gimme the lighter.” She holds out her hand.</p><p>Valentina looks indecisive for a minute and then pulls it out of her jacket pocket and slams it into Rio’s palm.</p><p>“Ah,” she hisses, because that hurt, and she pockets the lighter while shaking out her stinging hand. She sighs and looks at the principal. “Anything <em>else</em>?”</p><p>“Besides not doing school work and setting fires? No, I believe that covers everything we needed to speak about.”</p><p>“How much money am I getting?” Valentina asks as she follows Rio out of the office.</p><p>“I don’t know. A hundred bucks a day if you do all your work and don’t set any fires?”</p><p>“You’re loaded. I want two hundred a day.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t give a flying fuck. “Two hundred a day then. Don’t make me have to come back here.”</p><p>“Fine by me. I didn’t want you here anyway.”</p><p>“Why do I smell coffee?”</p><p>“There’s a back to school meeting in the library. Today it’s for the eleventh graders and their parents.”</p><p>Rio veers toward the smell. She’s at least going to get something out of this. “Over here?” she asks. There’s a set of double doors ahead.</p><p>“Yeah. You’re not going to go in there, are you? I’m in twelfth grade and you’re not my parent.”</p><p>“I’m gonna get some coffee. Nobody cares.”</p><p>“Agatha’s not going to like that you stole her tie.”</p><p>“I didn’t steal it, she left it,” Rio hisses. And then. The blood drains out of her body because… “She’s in there?”</p><p>“Yeah, Nicky’s in eleventh.”</p><p>And then the anger starts to bubble up, and, hand shaking, Rio grabs the door handle and shoves. The door flies open and crashes into the wall, and Rio scans the crowd until she sees <em>Agatha</em>.</p>

<p>Agatha turns her head at the sound of the door crashing open, and her heart jumps into her throat when she sees a furious Rio Vidal standing in the room.</p><p>Their eyes meet, and Agatha knows this is going to be absolutely ugly. And—holy fuck, Rio’s wearing her tie.</p><p>And walking toward her. Fuck, fuck, fuck, this is going to be bad. So bad. Unsalvageable.</p><p>“You let me think you were a stripper?” is the first thing out of Rio’s mouth. And it’s loud. And there’s not a single person in the library that didn’t hear it. Including her son.</p><p>She keeps her voice as neutral as possible. “Can we not do this here?”</p><p>“You called me a self-centered slut!” Rio shrieks.</p><p>Agatha feels her face burning but she’s not going to shout back. She leans closer and keeps her voice low. “Where’s the lie?”</p><p>Rio looks positively unhinged.</p><p>“Mom!” Nicky says, and she’s looking at Rio but she can hear the mortification in Nicky’s voice and it kills her.</p><p>Valentina, on the other hand, sounds gleeful. “You did? Fuck yeah!”</p><p>Principal Rooks comes rushing in and stops next to Rio. “Would you ladies please take this outside of the school?”</p><p>Rio’s lip curls up and she actually snarls at him. “You’re going to regret it,” she promises, focused on Agatha again.</p><p>“If you’re so offended, why are you wearing my tie?” She reaches over and rips it off of the train wreck of a woman in front of her. “Go dunk yourself in some cold water and sober up.”</p><p>Rio reaches for the tie, and the look on her face has gone from outraged to lost and vulnerable, but Agatha pulls it out of reach, not about to let her <em>keep</em> it, and takes a step back.</p><p>“Ladies, please. I have to insist. I’ll call security if I have to.”</p><p>“I’m sorry, Principal Rooks,” Agatha says. And she walks away before Rio can follow her, across to the side door and out into the cool air of the interior courtyard, leaning against the wall and trying to breathe.</p><p>Damage control with her son is going to be difficult. Why did Rio have to do that in front of him?</p><p>She hears the door open again and prays it’s not Rio, or Nicky, and to her utter relief it’s Lilia from the PTA. Someone she admires and respects, who raised her own children and is now raising her grandchildren, and who maybe might have a kind word for her in this dumpster fire of a moment.</p><p>Lilia sits down and pats the cement next to her, so Agatha slides down the wall.</p><p>“You okay?”</p><p>“Not really.”</p><p>“Nicky will understand.”</p><p>“I don’t think he will.”</p><p>“Give him a little more credit than that.”</p><p>“He sounded so humiliated,” Agatha says, tears stinging her eyes. “Why did she have to say that in front of him? How hard would it have been to step outside?”</p><p>“For a coked-up socialite? Probably pretty hard.”</p><p>Agatha laughs a little. “Thank you for that.”</p><p>“Get back in there, hold your head up, and talk to your son.”</p><p>“Is she gone?”</p><p>“She’s gone. She tried to follow you so Principal Rooks had security escort her out.”</p><p>“Thank God for small favors.”</p><p>Lilia chuckles and pats her knee, then points at the tie. “Did you gag her with it?”</p><p>“What?” Agatha’s gaze snaps to the fabric, and her eyes widen at the perfect set of teeth marks indented into it. “Oh my God. No, I didn’t.”</p><p>Lilia’s chuckle darkens, and she doesn’t say anything else, she just gets up and goes inside, holding the door for Agatha.</p><p>--</p><p>She takes Nicky and Valentina to an empty classroom and shuts the door. Nicky’s picking at his fingernails and Vee is beaming.</p><p>“I did not tell her I was a stripper,” she says first thing. “She assumed when she answered the door, and I didn’t correct her because she had a bunch of people over and I figured the best way to get her alone to speak to her was to go along with it.”</p><p>“Probably figured right,” Vee says.</p><p>Nicky says nothing. He won’t even look at her. She chokes up all over again.</p><p>“Nicky I’m so sorry,” she says, voice quiet. “I never meant for you to get embarrassed… I never wanted any of that to happen. I was just trying to protect your friend, I…” She doesn’t know what else to say.</p><p>“By calling her names, mom?” Nicky finally speaks, looking up.</p><p>“I could’ve handled it better,” she agrees. “I got upset when she so obviously didn’t care about anything and I lashed out at her.”</p><p>“She is a self-centered slut,” Valentina says. “Nothing wrong with saying the truth.”</p><p>“No, he’s right,” Agatha insists. “I should have done better.” She walks over and squats down in front of the desk he’s sitting at. “Can I still be your mom?”</p><p>It’s what she always asks when he’s been mad at her, ever since he was old enough to talk.</p><p>“Yeah,” he says grumpily.</p><p>Relief floods through Agatha like the crash of a tidal wave on a dry shore, because this was the very first time she was afraid to hear his answer.</p><p>“It sucks you lied to me though mom,” he says a few seconds later. “You didn’t take off your tie in the car, obviously, if she came here wearing it.”</p><p>“I’m sorry baby, I shouldn’t have lied. I just always want to protect you.”</p><p>Valentina’s enthusiasm has rapidly disappeared and Agatha glances over to see her silently crying.</p><p>“Heeeey,” she says, switching desks, rubbing the girl’s back. “What’s wrong honey?”</p><p>Vee leans into her and wraps her arms around her waist. “I miss my mom,” she chokes out.</p><p>“Ohh, sweet pea, I know you do,” Agatha says, hugging her back. “I know you do.”</p><p>Nicky gets up and makes heart hands at her as he slips out the door to give them privacy.</p><p>“I hate living with my aunt,” Vee continues. “She’s so cold, she doesn’t even care that her brother’s dead and she always hated my mom!”</p><p>Agatha rocks back and forth a little on her feet with Valentina cradled against her stomach. “You are welcome at my and Nicky’s house any time, okay? Literally any time of the day or night. Any time you need to be there. For any reason. Okay?”</p><p>Vee nods and holds her tighter.</p><p>Agatha is going to have to try again with Rio because this is absolutely unacceptable. This girl should not be feeling unwanted after losing both her parents and being uprooted from her life and plopped down in a strange place.</p><p>--</p><p>She waits until Saturday so she can go in the afternoon, and leaves Nicky and Vee watching some action movie. This time, she goes in comfortable clothes that are not mistakable for stripper attire – though how many strippers wear suits? Really? But she’s in jogging pants and a beater tank, just to be safe.</p><p>She raps on the door, and a few minutes later it swings open.</p><p>Rio looks tired, but when she sees who it is, she bares her teeth and growls. Agatha raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“Can I come in?”</p><p>“Absolutely the fuck not.”</p><p>“Rio, come on!” she hears from inside the house.</p><p>Agatha reaches into the pocket of her joggers and pulls out her tie. “You want this?”</p><p>Rio’s Pavlovian response is glaringly obvious as she licks her lips and reaches for it.</p><p>Agatha tuts and puts it back in her pocket. “Get rid of your friends and let me in.”</p><p>She doesn’t know what it is about the tie, but she watches with fascination as Rio steps out of the way to let her in, then continues to the living room and addresses her guests. “Get out.”</p><p>“We just got here,” one of them gripes, and Agatha watches Rio’s eyes turn to razors, honing in on the girl who said it.</p><p>“And you won’t be back,” Rio promises. “Get the fuck out.”</p><p>Agatha stands against the foyer wall to let them all past, and Rio slams the door after the last one, flicking the deadbolt locked.</p><p>She takes the tie out of her pocket again and holds it up, then walks down the hall to the room she’d been taken to last time she was here, and hears Rio’s footsteps click-clacking behind her on the top-tier wood.</p><p>When they’re in the room with the door shut, even though they’re alone in the house, she hangs the tie from one curled finger and asks, “what did you do with my tie?”</p><p>“Nothing,” Rio lies to her. “Give it to me. I let you in and got rid of my guests.”</p><p>“Not nothing,” Agatha says, slowly shaking her head. “I want to know what you did with it. There’s <em>teeth</em> marks in it, Rio.”</p><p>A flush crawls up Rio’s neck. “I was trying to rip it.”</p><p>Agatha laughs. “No, sugar, you weren’t trying to rip it. These teeth marks are perfectly indented, not scraped like they would be if that were the truth. What. Did. You do with it?”</p><p>She thinks the question has triggered some sort of fight or flight for a second, but then Rio gives in. “I bit it.”</p><p>Surprised at the actual admission, but pleased nonetheless, she pushes further. “<em>Why</em>?”</p><p>Rio sneers at her. “Figure it out.”</p><p>Agatha’s not deterred. She swings the tie back and forth, watching Rio’s eyes track it. “Where were you when you put my tie in your mouth, Rio?”</p><p>“On the sofa,” Rio says, and Agatha hears her breath catch.</p><p>“Were you alone?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>That answer throws her off because she thought for sure Rio would have been using the tie for some kinky sex shit just to be a dick, but the more she stands there, the darker Rio’s cheeks flush, the clearer things get. And she realizes that Rio being alone definitely does not mean she didn’t use the tie for kinky sex shit. “Did you get yourself off biting my tie?” Her voice is higher pitched than she’d like, but holy god damn.</p><p>“No!” Rio shouts. “Give me the fucking tie and get out of my house.”</p><p>Agatha’s deliciously amused. “You did. You fucked yourself after I left, and you gagged yourself with my tie. Because it turned you on so bad having a stripper humiliate and degrade you and then leave you to deal with yourself.”</p><p>“You’re not even a stripper,” Rio says, eyes narrowed.</p><p>Agatha pockets the tie and the transformation is instant. Rio’s expression turns pleading, a whimper escaping parted lips. “What is it about my tie?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head as if the answer to that question is worse than admitting she’d gotten herself off.</p><p>Agatha shrugs and starts for the door.</p><p>“I’ll admit it!” Rio shouts, launching herself in front of the door. “I got myself off thinking about you. About what you said to me. About your hair and your eyes. And I put the tie in my mouth because it smelled like you, and I rutted against the sofa cushion like a pathetic, drug-addled waste of space until I came all over my hand, is that what you want to hear?”</p><p>Agatha’s brain short circuits, because it’s not what she expected to hear. Not all those details. And what leaves her mouth is not what she expects to leave her mouth. “Do it again.”</p><p>“What?” Rio gasps. “Are you fucking crazy? Not a chance in hell, you psychotic fucking—”</p><p>She stops talking because Agatha whips the tie out again and stretches it across Rio’s mouth, forcing it between her teeth.</p><p>Rio’s eyes go wide, but she bites down. She’s shaking. Trembling. Her chest is heaving.</p><p>“Do. It. Again.”</p><p>Rio swallows hard, staring at Agatha, a glassy coating covering those big brown eyes. And then, with a wholly pathetic, tiny whimper, she nods.</p><p>Agatha contains herself to a mere nod in response, then lifts her chin toward the door to indicate Rio should precede her out of the room.</p><p>Rio keeps the tie between her teeth and turns, opens the door, then wobbles down the hall to the living room.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth finally catches up to her brain. “You’re going to do it exactly how you did it last time.”</p><p>Rio lowers herself to the sofa and lays face down with her head turned toward Agatha and her eyes closed.</p><p>On her stomach? Jesus. “That’s how you were before?” she asks, making her tone sound sharper than she wants it.</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>And then she reaches down to pull up her dress, and Agatha’s so entirely fucked. Because it’s the hottest thing she’s ever seen. <em>Rio</em> is the hottest thing she’s ever seen. And face down on the sofa with her dress rucked up around her hips? Jesus fucking Christ.</p><p>Rio hesitates, and Agatha snaps at her.</p><p>“What are you waiting for?”</p><p>Rio whimpers again and works a hand underneath her, into the front of her panties, and grinds her hips against the sofa cushion.</p><p>Agatha forgets how to breathe.</p><p>She’ll never see anything so beautiful again as long as she lives. The frustrated, concentrated look on Rio’s pretty face. The way her back muscles work as she moves. The expensive lace thong that does nothing to hide the smooth, flawless shape of her ass. The little noises she’s making. The sweet smell of her expensive house. The way her feet are crossed at the ankle, high heels knocking together with every rut of her hips.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything because she knows anything she says will just help Rio out. But she’s never seen anything like this, and she’s transfixed. It’s hard to decide where to put her eyes so she just tracks them up and down, from Rio’s face to her middle to her crossed ankles, looking at and taking in everything.</p><p>And she finds herself anticipating the moment when Rio falls apart. Finds herself aching to witness it. She doesn’t even want to consider what any of this says about her.</p><p>As Rio gets closer, Agatha gets more and more agitated, wanting her to come.</p><p>She can’t take it anymore. Her mouth opens and issues the most grievous betrayal of her self-control she has ever experienced. “Fucking whore,” she hisses, and Rio comes undone.</p><p>It’s majestic, the way she nearly screams, her head lifting off the sofa, back arched, hips stuttering out an orgasm. Then she collapses fully, and Agatha can see her back rising and falling with labored breaths.</p><p>Angry at herself, she strides forward, grabs Rio by the hair, and rips the tie out of her mouth. “If you want to see this again, you’re gonna start cleaning up your act,” she vows. “And if you ever mention anything in front of those children again, I will burn it to fucking ash.”</p><p>She drops Rio’s hair and heads for the front door. When she hears a thud from behind her, curiosity gets the better of her and she stops with her hand on the doorknob, looking over her shoulder, and Rio is on her knees.</p><p>“Please don’t take it,” she begs.</p><p>“It’s mine,” Agatha snaps and leaves.</p>

<p>Rio watches her go, feeling broken. It’s just a tie to Agatha, but it’s so much more to her. It represents the one spark of life in her dead black heart. The one spark of anything she’s felt in the last twenty-something years. And it’s gone. It’s gone. For what? So she can be alone and indifferent again. Never wanting, never taking, never having. Never seeing the point in being human.</p><p>Cleaning up her act? She wouldn’t even know where to begin.</p><p>Aching and empty, she crawls to the coffee table, crushes up an eight ball, and sniffs her problems away up her nose.</p><p>She doesn’t know how long she lays sprawled out on the carpet staring at the ceiling, but at some point she hears the door and ignores it. She resolves to ignore everything for the rest of the night. Week, maybe. Or her entire life. Nothing good comes from paying attention.</p><p>Her niece’s face appears above hers. “Get up.”</p><p>“Go fuck yourself?” Rio scoffs.</p><p>“I’m serious, get up, CYS is here and a cop. You’re lucky I convinced them to let me come in first and make sure you were awake.”</p><p>Rio’s buzz is instantly killed and she shoots up, closing every magazine on the table to hide what she’s sure would amount to over an ounce of possession charges, and scrambles to shove all of the paraphernalia under the couch.</p><p>“The only reason I’m not turning your dumb ass in is because I want that two hundred bucks a day, so don’t even think about trying to stiff me on it.”</p><p>Rio growls and staggers to her feet, brushing her hair back uselessly and going to open the door.</p><p>Valentina stops her. “Actually, I want three hundred a day or I’ll go open up those magazines.”</p><p>“Fine! God!” Rio hisses and jerks open the door.</p><p>“Ms. Vidal?” There’s a woman in a skirt suit standing next to a uniformed police officer.</p><p>“Yeah.”</p><p>“My name is Anastasia Ballard, I’m with Child and Youth Services. We received a call about your situation here and need to perform a short investigation to make sure Valentina’s needs are being met. May we come in?”</p><p>“Do I have a choice?” She looks at the officer. “And why are you here?”</p><p>He takes off his hat. “Standard procedure, ma’am.”</p><p>“Don’t call me ma’am. I guess you can come in, let’s just get this over with.” She moves out of the way and they both step inside. “What do you need to know?”</p><p>“We’ll need to check there’s adequate food in the house, that Valentina has a bedroom with a bed to sleep in and a dresser for her clothes. We’ll need to inspect the house for any safety hazards such as mold, unsteady flooring, exposed electrical wires, things like that.”</p><p>“Why would she have a bed for any reason other than to sleep in it?”</p><p>“I beg your pardon?”</p><p>“You said check she has a bed to sleep in. What else would it be for?”</p><p>“They just say that, Auntie Rio,” Valentina interrupts. “Can you show them my room or should I?”</p><p>The girl damn well knows Rio doesn’t give a fuck which room she sleeps in. “You go ahead.” She watches them go down the hall and turns to the officer. “Are you going in every room because I don’t want you in my closet.”</p><p>He just clutches his hat to his chest with one hand and scratches his nose with the other. “That’s up to Mrs. Ballard, ma’am.”</p><p>“I said don’t call me ma’am.”</p><p>He doesn’t say anything else.</p><p>“So you’ll stay out of my closet?”</p><p>“That’s not my call.”</p><p>She rolls her eyes and flops down on the sofa.</p><p>Ages later the CYS woman comes back into the living room with her niece. “Her bedroom looks good, but the lack of food in the kitchen is a problem,” the woman says.</p><p>“We order in,” Rio says.</p><p>“Be that as it may, the state requires you to keep enough nutrition in the house for a child at all times,” the woman says. “You’ll have three days to correct the issue or you’ll be issued a fine and Valentina may be removed to a temporary foster home until further notice.”</p><p>Rio’s about to open up her mouth and say best case scenario when she catches Valentina’s eye, who very obviously glances down at the magazines on the coffee table. So Rio ends up agreeing to fix it. “Fine. I’ll get groceries delivered tonight.”</p><p>“If you need a list of acceptable foods to meet the criteria—”</p><p>“No, I think I can figure it out, thanks,” she deadpans. “Are you done?”</p><p>“For today, yes. I’ll be back in three days to verify you’ve corrected the nutritional issue. If I am able to verify that, I will close out the case.”</p><p>“Amazing. I’m sure you can walk yourself out.”</p><p>When they’re gone, Rio scowls at Valentina. “Who the fuck called them?”</p><p>“What do you care?”</p><p>Rio supposes she really doesn’t, and hums her acknowledgment of such.</p><p>“What really happened the other night?”</p><p>Rio snaps her head around at the intrusion to her inner quiet. “You’re still here?”</p><p>“I’ve been standing in front of you this entire time you fucking idiot,” her niece says, gesturing wildly. “What happened the night you stole Agatha’s tie?”</p><p>Rio grits her teeth. “I didn’t steal it,” she grinds out. “She left it here. What did she say happened? She told you I stole it? I didn’t.”</p><p>The mention of the tie has Rio’s salivary glands working overtime. She wants to tell her niece exactly what happened, and make Agatha look like the asshole she is, but the issued threat she had made still lingers. <em>…mention anything in front of those children again, I will burn it to fucking ash</em>.</p><p>“She said she told you off but you were too high to understand the situation.”</p><p>“I understood she was telling me off, I just didn’t appreciate it,” Rio lies. Because God, that’s one hundred percent untrue. The level of appreciation Rio had and still has for that telling off is through the roof. Even now, talking about it makes her hot under the collar. “I’m feeling feverish. Go away.”</p><p>Valentina rolls her eyes. “I’m going back to Agatha’s as soon as you give me my money.”</p><p>“What?” That has Rio’s undivided attention. “What do you mean going <em>back</em> to Agatha’s? You’ve been at her house?”</p><p>“Oh, suddenly Auntie’s interested in my comings and goings? Fuck off, Rio.”</p><p>A surge of sudden, irrational, white-hot jealousy rips through her entire body and leaves her standing there shaking, that anyone gets to be at Agatha’s house that isn’t <em>her</em>. And the crippling thought that now plagues her is what if Agatha has a partner?</p><p>Rio is not used to even thinking about these things, let alone caring about them, and she doesn’t know how to behave.</p><p>“You shouldn’t be at a stranger’s house. What if her boyfriend tries to molest you in your sleep?”</p><p>“Oh my God, are you for r—is that—are you fucking kidding me? For so many reasons, are you fucking kidding me?”</p><p>“What?” Rio blinks.</p><p>“First of all, hello? I had to literally steal money from you to buy a lock for my bedroom door because YOU have strange men and women here all hours of the day and night! Second of all, she doesn’t have a boyfriend, it’s just her and Nicky.”</p><p>“Who’s Nicky? Her girlfriend?” Rio doesn’t know if that’s better or worse.</p><p>“Her son, you fucking moron! My friend, who I TOLD you about, but you don’t ever fucking LISTEN because you don’t give two FUCKS about anyone but YOURSELF! Give me my fucking money before I lose my mind and go back on my promise to myself not to put my hands on you, Aunt Rio.”</p><p>Rio is so baffled by the entire exchange and her feelings about it that she just wanders absently to her purse, pulls out three hundreds, and hands them over without saying anything else.</p><p>The world is too bright and her nerves too raw, and she doesn’t care what time it is, she goes upstairs, takes a sleeping pill, and gets in bed.</p><p>--</p><p>Her unconscious has some more treats in store, because she wakes up hours and hours later screaming, clutching her stomach in a panic. When the shot of adrenaline dissipates, she’s left struggling for breath in the wake of the nightmare and looking down to make sure her insides are still on the inside.</p><p>She’s drenched in sweat, but thank god it isn’t blood, and she staggers to the shower, only realizing she didn’t take off her clothes when the wet fabric starts sticking to her body.</p><p>She’d dreamt of Agatha again, but this time… the other woman was cutting her open and pulling out her organs, slicing each one’s protective coating to bleed them out, one at a time, while Rio was forced to watch.</p><p>She tries to block out the graphic images, to ignore the phantom pain in her belly left over from the experience, but it’s all too much. They engulf her and sweep her away with the tide, and she passes out on the shower floor.</p><p>--</p><p>“Hey. Hey!”</p><p>Rio blinks her eyes open when a persistent voice won’t go away. The first thing she notices is that she’s freezing. The second thing she notices is that she’s still in the shower. The water has stopped, and her niece is crouched over her, and when she turns her head, she groans, because the entire bathroom is flooded.</p><p>“Ughhhh,” she complains. “I’m freezing.”</p><p>“Yeah, I don’t care about that. I just came by to get some stuff and noticed water dripping through the ceiling so I figured I’d make sure you weren’t dead. Can’t get paid if you’re dead and I’m not in the will.”</p><p>“Through the c—nooo, ah, fuck,” Rio curses, struggling to sit up, and when she moves off the drain, the water she’s pooled in starts swirling and gurgling as it’s sucked down.</p><p>“So, you’re alive, I’ve done my familial duty, I’m going to grab my stuff and leave now. Have fun cleaning this up.”</p><p>She watches Valentina leave the bathroom, and just as she’s putting her head in her hands to block out the situation, she hears a throat clear that is <em>decidedly</em> not her niece.</p><p>No, no, no. This is not happening. The only good thing about this is that she’s no longer freezing, she’s sweltering. “I didn’t invite you in here,” she says, trying to sound scathing, but no amount of effort is going to make her <em>actually</em> sound like she doesn’t want Agatha in her house.</p><p>“When I said clean up your act, I didn’t mean this,” Agatha says, and Rio can hear the self-satisfied grin even though she can’t see Agatha from around the corner.</p><p>“Be more specific next time,” she spits.</p><p>The chuckle she gets in response is slightly alarming.</p><p>“Right, right.” Agatha clucks her tongue, and Rio imagines it on her clit. Fuck. “What was I thinking? That someone like you would have any idea how to clean up <em>anything</em>?”</p><p>Rio shivers, but doesn’t want to lose this battle so easily. “Pour some coke on the floor, I can clean that up in five seconds,” she retorts.</p><p>She hears water sloshing, and then sees Agatha come into view and look down at her, shooting daggers. “That’s not funny. You’re responsible for a child.”</p><p>“Look at me!” Rio finally shouts, extending her arms in a helpless but angry gesture. “In what universe should my brother have left me his child?!”</p><p>Agatha reaches into the shower and grabs her by the dress, hauling her to her feet. “Then <em>do</em> something about it!”</p><p>Rio shoves her. “Don’t <em>touch</em> me!” she screams. “Fuck you and your judgment! You don’t know anything about me!”</p><p>“Don’t I?” Agatha asks, voice lowered, and Rio thinks it’s the first time she’s seen the other woman look dangerous. “I know—”</p><p>Whatever she’s about to say is cut off by the arrival of two skidding-to-a-halt teenagers in the bathroom doorway.</p><p>“Mom?” the boy—Nicky, right?—says almost nervously.</p><p>“Yeah, fuck her up!” Valentina chants.</p><p>Rio watches Agatha take her keys out of her pocket and turn to the doorway. “Vee, do you drive?”</p><p><em>Vee</em>?</p><p>“Fuck yeah I do,” Valentina says and snatches the keys out of the air when Agatha throws them.</p><p>“I’ll meet you at home,” Agatha tells her son.</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Nicky, please. I’m not going to hurt her.”</p><p><em>Likely story</em>, Rio thinks, but somehow she’s frozen in place watching and hearing this all play out.</p><p>“Okay,” he says, but Rio can tell he’s not happy about it.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t say anything until they both hear the door shut after the kids. “Dry off and get dressed. I’ll be in the hall.”</p><p>“Why would I do anything you tell me to do?”</p><p>“Because something about my tie has triggered a response in you that makes you trainable,” Agatha says. “I’ll be in the hall.”</p>

<p>Agatha waits in the hall while Rio presumably dries off and gets dressed, but when it’s taking longer than expected, she knocks on the bedroom door. “Are you about done?”</p><p>“Fuck off,” comes the response through the door.</p><p>She snorts and opens it, and Rio is fully dressed – in a fucking ball gown and heels, at that—sitting on the edge of her bed inspecting her fingernails. She’s managed to get her hair up into a messy bun, which is ten times better than the waterlogged mess it was a half hour ago, and she’s applied makeup.</p><p>“You might want to put on something more suitable for being on your hands and knees soaking up all that water,” she says.</p><p>Rio barely looks at her. “Don’t be ridiculous. My cleaning service comes tomorrow.”</p><p>Oh my God. “Are you—you’re just planning to let that soak overnight? When it’s already dripping downstairs?”</p><p>“I’ll have to replace the floor anyway, what’s the difference?”</p><p><em>You promised Nicky you wouldn’t hurt her</em>, she tells herself. Then she wonders if hurting includes slapping, because maybe she wouldn’t be breaking her promise if she lays one on the spoiled rotten—okay no. Nope. No. She’ll just use the tie. Rio reacts to it like a dog to a bone.</p><p>She pulls it out of her pocket and slips it over her head, and she clocks the moment Rio notices because her eyes dilate and her mouth opens, and she stops examining her fingernails.</p><p><em>Good puppy</em>, she thinks. “Go get some towels.”</p><p>“I—I don’t want to clean that up,” Rio protests, hands beside her on the bed, white-knuckling the comforter.</p><p>Agatha slowly walks toward her and uses one of her knees to nudge Rio’s legs apart so she can stand between them. She runs her hand down the front of the tie and plays with the tail a little. “Do you want to wear this, Rio?”</p><p>Rio looks up at her, pupils completely blown. “Yes,” she squeaks.</p><p>“Go get some towels and you can wear it,” Agatha purrs.</p><p>Rio gives her a dubious look but skirts off the bed and disappears out the door, coming back a few minutes later with an armful of very expensive-looking thick fluffy towels.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says, and Rio drops the towels and stumbles her step.</p><p>“What?”</p><p>Agatha ignores the question and moves on, removing the tie from her own neck and slipping it over Rio’s head, enjoying the full-body shiver it produces. “Whatever it is about this tie,” she says, keeping her voice intimate, “I’m going to use it to train you, Rio.”</p><p>Rio whimpers and her knees buckle.</p><p>Agatha appreciates the view. “That’s a good start. Take one of the towels and go soak up as much water as it’ll hold.”</p><p>She watches, fascinated, as Rio picks up a towel and shuffles over to the bathroom doorway on her knees, and holy God, because just before she puts the towel down she looks over her shoulder uncertainly, and Agatha nods in encouragement, stifling a moan.</p><p>Rio turns back to the mess and lays the towel in the water.</p><p>Agatha’s hand twitches with restraint, because it would be so easy to just walk over and give Rio’s butt a few little smacks while she works. But that might be pushing too far, and Agatha’s nothing if not patient.</p><p>“When that one’s soaked, get another one and put it in,” she says, because somehow, she doesn’t think that a) Rio knows how to clean up water, and b) Rio can really think logically about what to do next right now even if she does know how to clean up water.</p><p>Rio turns to look at her. “What do I do with this one?” she asks.</p><p>“Just leave it, it won’t make the others less able to soak it up,” Agatha says. Looks like she was right. Rio doesn’t know how to clean up water.</p><p>Oh, the things her brain does to her as her eyes track Rio crawling over to get another towel and crawling back to the bathroom doorway to lay it down. Has there ever been a more appealing sight? She thinks not. Though she does try not to get too sidetracked because she’s doing this for a good reason, not just to make Rio crawl around so she can watch and get off.</p><p>When all the towels have been used up, most of the water is gone, but not all of it. “Put those in the shower, but make sure you don’t cover the drain.”</p><p>Rio stands up, picks up a few at a time and heaves them into the walk-in shower, then shoves them away from the drain with her foot when they’re all in. “Now what? There’s still water.”</p><p>“There’s not that much left. Do you have any more towels?”</p><p>“Yes, but—”</p><p>“Go get them.”</p><p>“How many more will I need?”</p><p>“Look at the amount of water that’s left and think for yourself.” <em>For once</em>.</p><p>Rio squints at the bathroom floor and Agatha can see her trying to work it out. “Maybe five?”</p><p>“Five will probably do it,” Agatha agrees. <em>See? You do have a brain</em>, she wants to say.</p><p>Rio comes back with five more fluffy towels and finishes cleaning the water from the bathroom floor, then tosses the towels into the shower and makes sure the drain is clear. Agatha watches with an approving gaze. Very trainable indeed.</p><p>She steps in and walks around, inspecting Rio’s work, and stops dead in her tracks when she sees the toilet. “Is that dried vomit all over your toilet?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Probably.”</p><p>One step forward, two steps back. “Jesus Christ, Rio. You are not making your cleaning service scrub dried vomit out of your toilet.”</p><p>Rio crosses her arms. “I pay them very well. They don’t complain.”</p><p>“To your face,” Agatha says incredulously, and lifts up the toilet seat with her shoe, then rummages around under the sink until she finds some cleaner with bleach. She sprays a generous amount around the toilet bowl and picks up the wand, holding it out to Rio. “You’re cleaning that yourself.”</p><p>“The fuck I am.”</p><p>Agatha replaces the wand for the moment and steps forward into Rio’s personal space. Rio steps back, and Agatha steps forward, until Rio’s against the wall with nowhere to go and Agatha’s almost touching her.</p><p>The air between them crackles as she lifts her hands and grabs the tie, loosening it until she can bring it up just high enough to force into Rio’s mouth. “Bite.”</p><p>Rio does.</p><p>“Get on your hands and knees and scrub the toilet until there’s no traces of vomit left.” Her voice is cold; detached.</p><p>Rio grabs onto her arm for support as she goes to her knees, then down to her hands, her breaths wheezing out as she grabs the wand and starts scrubbing.</p><p>Agatha watches her, trying so fucking hard to keep her hands to herself, and she succeeds for several minutes, but the pull is too strong and she finally gives up. She leans down and brings her palm against one of Rio’s ass cheeks, crisp and firm. “Every two minutes it’s not clean you get another,” she says, and her voice is almost unrecognizable it’s so sultry and full of gravel.</p>

<p>Rio freezes, a low moan bubbling up from her throat and winding its way past her gritted teeth. Oh god, god, god, she’s going fucking crazy, she’s sure of it. She’s never been so wet in her life. Being forced to clean her own vomit and getting spanked on her ass every two minutes she’s not done? Jesus fucking Christ. How is she meant to survive this? Feeling Agatha’s discipline, it’s just… it’s just… she doesn’t even know how to allow herself to think about it because it’s so outrageous and fuck, Agatha’s so attractive with her authoritative demands and always knowing what to do, and—</p><p>A spank lands on her other cheek and she realizes she must’ve been rambling in her head for two whole minutes not doing anything to clean the toilet, and how is she supposed to focus on anything besides the burning pain blooming across her skin that’s causing her cunt to throb and clench on nothing and beg for attention?</p><p>She doesn’t know how to clean a toilet anyway. She starts moving the wand again but she’s not doing a very good job, and not much of the dried up disgusting stuff is coming off.</p><p>Another spank lights up the left side of her ass and she whines because she <em>is</em> trying.</p><p>She hears Agatha sigh and then feels hands close around hers and show her how to angle the wand and how much pressure to use to get the job done.</p><p>Is it strange how much she wants to say thank you?</p><p>Agatha’s hands release hers but the other woman doesn’t draw completely away. There’s warm breath on her ear and whispered words that turn her inside out.</p><p>“You look pretty like this.”</p><p>The way her eyes fill with tears at the praise is pathetic. She’s used to praise, from anyone and everyone, but none of it sincere. It’s niceties and platitudes so she’ll keep letting them ride her coattails or snort her drugs or drink her booze. Nothing as simple as telling her she looks pretty on her hands and knees doing household chores.</p><p>She scrubs faster, wanting to get the job done not just to get it over with anymore, but to meet Agatha’s approval.</p><p>Another minute ticks by as she works and Agatha spanks her on the right side, the pain sharp and stinging and making her groan. But she’s almost done. There’s just one more spot. She attacks it with vigor, and finally, the toilet bowl is shining, without a trace of anything marring the porcelain surface.</p><p>She’s never been prouder of something she’s done, which she’s aware is absolutely mind-fuckingly twisted, but she doesn’t care. She looks over her shoulder at Agatha to ask for her appraisal, and the blissed out look in those haunting blue eyes imprints in Rio’s brain permanently. She will never forget it. Is Agatha affected by her in that way? In the same way Rio is affected?</p><p>Agatha leans over her to inspect her work, and the wand is lifted from her grasp and placed back in its holder. She’s not sure what to do now. Stay where she is? Get up? Sit on her heels and wait?</p><p>A hand in her hair directs her up onto her knees and forces her head back so she has no choice but to look at Agatha.</p><p>Fuck, she’s so lost. In the depths of that swirling blue hurricane she would willingly throw herself into and be consumed by. The gaze that makes her feel like being dead inside could maybe, possibly, be only a phase.</p><p>She has never anticipated anything like she anticipates Agatha’s next words.</p><p>“Good girl, Rio.”</p><p>She can feel her eyes roll back and she shudders, the words nearly flaying her alive. Her thighs are clenched so tight her pelvic floor muscles keep stabbing her in the cunt. The sound that leaves her lips as her mouth opens and the tie tumbles out to settle around her neck is nothing short of depraved. Even she can hear how utterly unhinged she sounds, but she can’t find it in herself to care. Because for once, for once in her fucking life, she <em>feels</em> something other than numb.</p>

<p>Agatha’s eyes nearly roll back too as she watches Rio’s reaction to being called a good girl after completing a task. It was different in the bedroom when she dropped the towels and said ‘what?’ because that was casual and almost flippant on Agatha’s part. This, she means it. She’s giving Rio genuine praise on a job well done, and she can tell how hard it hits. Rio is practically a writhing mess on the floor in front of her, and fuck, it is intoxicating. She’s on the highest of power highs she’s ever been on. Her senses are attuned to every movement Rio makes, every sound, every single shift in the air.</p><p>And then the girl speaks.</p><p>“Please,” Rio begs, staring up at her with watery brown eyes that tell her she holds Rio’s world in the palm of her hand.</p><p>It’s scary, to have this much power over someone. Scary, but so goddamn good.</p><p>She doesn’t respond. She doesn’t even know what Rio’s asking, for sure. And there’s no way she can give it, if it is what she thinks. As much as she’d love to sink her fingers into that pretty cunt and her teeth into that pretty throat, she can’t. That’s not what this is supposed to be.</p><p>“Please,” Rio says again, her tone taking on an escalating edge.</p><p>Agatha has to respond. She can’t just let her kneel there saying please over and over. “I can’t, sugar,” she says with a sigh. “Cleaning the bathroom once doesn’t make you any less of a self-centered slut. I can’t.”</p><p>Rio whines, a pathetic sound without any words behind it, and she can’t be still, she’s squirming constantly. She looks like she might actually cry.</p><p>Agatha switches to damage control mode quickly and tugs on the tie to get Rio to her feet. “But you can touch yourself for me, sugar,” she offers, keeping hold of the tie. “Would you like to do that? Just because I can’t make you come doesn’t mean you don’t deserve a little treat for your hard work.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes blow like fireworks and Agatha can see the indecision playing behind them. She wants it, that much is clear, but she’s struggling to really process the scene.</p><p>So Agatha waits. Just lets her eyes absorb everything about Rio’s beautiful face. Long, thick lashes. Dark painted eyelids. Broken blood vessels in the whites of her eyes. The most perfect, adorable nose Agatha’s ever seen. Parted lips, coated in glossy maroon lipstick, and for the first time, Agatha notices the absolutely precious and emotion-invoking gap between her front teeth.</p><p>She’s about to flick her gaze further down when Rio nods. And that just causes a whole new round of power-hungry thoughts and feels.</p><p>“You do want to?” she asks, fisting her hands to avoid touching Rio under the chin or on the shoulder or anywhere, really. “You want to make yourself feel good before I leave?”</p><p>Rio nods again, lower lip pulled between her teeth, and another surge of wetness leaks out onto Agatha’s underwear as she stands there deciding how to proceed.</p><p>“You did a good job on the toilet, and soaking up the water,” Agatha says quietly, letting the tiniest bit of affection taint her tone. “Would you like to show me everything this time? Or would you like to do it the same as before?”</p><p>Rio’s chest is heaving and a rivulet of blood forms where her teeth are digging the most sharply into her lip. Her eyelids flutter as she says, “show you everything.”</p><p>Agatha’s nostrils flare and she grits her teeth until her jaw aches. Then slowly nods. “Get up on the bed then. On your back.”</p><p>Rio wobbles less than usual as she walks past and climbs up onto the bed, into the middle of the plush, five-billion-thread-count comforter, and turns on her back.</p><p>Agatha notices everything. The way the mattress dips beneath her weight, the way it forms to the shape of her. The trembling in her arms and legs. The rise and fall of her chest. The glistening sweat on her forehead. “Get your dress up,” she says.</p><p>Rio does.</p><p>Agatha sits on the edge of the bed and reaches over, careful not to touch Rio’s skin as she pinches the waistband of her La Perla underwear and drags them down shaking legs.</p><p>“Did you wear these in the shower?” she whispers, dangling the saturated fabric over Rio’s face.</p><p>As expected, a flush starts on her neck, and Rio shakes her head.</p><p>“They’re ruined,” Agatha purrs, tossing them over her shoulder. “You ruined La Perla underwear getting off to being forced to scrub vomit out of your toilet.”</p><p>Rio whines, her hips lifting.</p><p>Agatha is met with a very close-up view of her dripping cunt and the smell assaults her like a prime cut of meat the moment your knife first slices into it. It makes her literally drool.</p><p>She backs off slowly to avoid burying her face between Rio’s legs and ruining everything she’s working for.</p><p>She crawls over Rio on all fours and then backs down the bed. “Show me,” she says.</p><p>Rio eases her knees apart and lets Agatha have her fill of looking. Which Agatha could never reach, because no amount of looking at Rio’s pussy will ever be enough, she’s decided that right now. It’s perfect. And the way her clit is standing at attention, already starved and needy… Christ, she needs a cold shower. Preferably not one that floods the bathroom.</p><p>“You know how pathetic this is, right?” she asks, tilting her head, tutting at Rio.</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>Because of course she does.</p><p>And then in an echo of the last time, she snaps, “what are you waiting for?”</p><p>Rio startles at the abrupt tone change and drops a hand between her legs, running her fingertip up and down through her glistening labia. Agatha appreciates the way they flower and fold in the wake of the touch, with every pass of Rio’s finger.</p><p>“Your cunt is hungry,” she whispers. “Do you not feed her often enough?” She feels like a vampire with venom swirling in her mouth, the way she wants to bite Rio’s thighs.</p><p>“I—I’m not usually interested,” Rio pants, and her finger stills.</p><p>Agatha can’t be held responsible for her actions because she’s on a hair trigger, and when Rio’s finger stops moving, she claps her hand down sharply on the inside of one thigh. “Don’t stop.”</p><p>Rio yelps and her hips buck and she resumes the motion of her finger up and down, and a red handprint forms on her thigh, and Agatha is satisfied for the moment, sitting back on her haunches with a low growl.</p><p>“Don’t stop again.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio says, eyes trained on Agatha’s mouth, and when her finger dips down near her clenching hole, Agatha can see the muscles trying to suck it inside.</p><p>Rio denies her cunt what it wants and strokes back upward, and Agatha shakes her head. “Put them in.”</p><p>Rio groans and arches her back off the bed, supported by the back of her head on her pillows, and crawls her finger lower again, joining it with her middle, and puts them both inside herself.</p><p>“Thumb on your clit, let’s go, sugar, I don’t have all night…”</p><p>Rio makes a little mewling sound and obeys, rubbing her thumb over her clit as she fingers herself, and soon her hips are jerking toward every circle she makes.</p><p>“There you go,” Agatha croons. “So pretty fucking yourself for me, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio eats up the praise like a starving piranha, teeth gnashing and all, as if she can suck the words out of the air and swallow them. She peaks almost instantly, shuddering with pleasure, drawing her knees up to help her ride out the storm.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says in a low, purring voice, sliding up the bed to take her tie from around Rio’s neck. “I’ve got to go.” She puts the tie on herself and Rio clearly doesn’t want her to go but doesn’t seem to have the energy to do more than whimper.</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha is bombarded with questions when she steps through the door.</p><p>“Mom, did you hit her? You didn’t, did you? How did you get home?”</p><p>“Uber.”</p><p>“I hope you did, please tell me you smacked her right in the mouth?”</p><p>Agatha blinks at them both, at their conflicting ideologies, and can she honestly say she didn’t hit her when she spanked her a few times? Yes, Jesus, of course she can say that. She has to say that. “No no, I didn’t hit her,” she says.</p><p>Nicky sighs with relief but Valentina just looks shrewd.</p><p>“You totally did. What did you do?” she insists.</p><p>Agatha levels them both with a very parental stare. “I am not discussing anything that happened with either of you. You’re children, so go be children and play video games.”</p><p>When they’re otherwise occupied, she’s going to lock herself in the bathroom, shower, and get herself off.</p><p>“Will you play with us?” Nicky asks.</p><p>Aaaaaand, her plans of privacy and taking care of herself will have to wait. “Yeah, of course, baby,” she says. “Let me just change into pajamas.” Because she’s not playing video games in uncomfortably wet underwear, she draws the line.</p><p>Both of their faces light up and she’s glad she didn’t say no. She shuffles off to get changed, and, much more comfortable, flops onto the sofa and reaches for one of Nicky’s controllers.</p><p>“I suck, by the way,” she tells Valentina.</p><p>“At which game?” Vee asks.</p><p>“All of them,” Agatha says.</p><p>Nicky grins, navigating menus. “She’s not that bad,” he says.</p><p>“Oh, I am,” Agatha argues. “He’s just nice because he loves me.”</p><p>“Okay, she’s really bad at Fortnite,” Nicky finally relents. “But not bad at Mario Party. And we can’t play Fortnite with three of us anyway because the split screen would be too small and I don’t know if it would even split three ways, so we’ll just play Mario Party.”</p><p>“Thank God,” Agatha mutters. She hates playing Fortnite because even though Nicky’s nice when they get ranked like number forty-eight, she hates making him lose. Not that he’s a kid who cares too much about winning, but still.</p><p>“He probably doesn’t care how good you are at playing, just thinks it’s cool you’ll play with him,” Valentina says, a little subdued. “My dad used to play with me. Mom not so much. Once in a while. But she was shit at it too. I didn’t care, though. I’d rather have lost playing with her than won playing by myself when I was younger.”</p><p>Agatha gives her a quick side hug, not wanting to draw too much attention to the emotion behind her story, but wanting to acknowledge it, and then starts hitting buttons on her controller.</p><p>“Mom, it’s loading.”</p><p>“I know. I’m practicing.”</p><p>She loses almost every round, but she has fun playing with them, and around ten o’clock she stretches with an exaggerated sigh. “Okay. Bedtime for me. Work in the morning.”</p><p>“Gross, on a Sunday?” Vee asks, scrunching up her nose.</p><p>“If I want to afford the mortgage and food,” Agatha says.</p><p>“I can pay you some rent,” Vee offers.</p><p>Agatha is horrified. “Never say that again. Don’t be ridiculous. Good night, you heathens.”</p><p>“Night mom. Love you.”</p><p>“Love you too.” She ruffles his hair and kisses his head. “Night Vee.”</p><p>“Night Agatha.”</p><p>--</p><p>Work is dull. At least her Sunday shifts are only four hours and paid at time and a half. She’s craving coffee by the time she gets home a little after twelve thirty, and when she goes to take the pot to wash it, she stands there blinking, because in place of her old, beat-up, on-its-last-legs generic coffeemaker is a shiny, brand-new Keurig.</p><p>“What the hell is this?” she calls through the house, her heart racing.</p><p>Nicky comes into the kitchen a minute later. “Vee got it for you. She said yours looked decrepit.”</p><p>Agatha leans on the counter for support. “Why did your seventeen-year-old friend buy me a Keurig?”</p><p>“Mom. I just told you why.”</p><p>“But that’s not…” She puts a hand to her forehead. “She has to take it back. I can’t accept this.”</p><p>“She knew you would say that so she smashed the coffee pot and ripped the cord out of your old one before she put it in the dumpster just in case.”</p><p>The noise Agatha makes is despairing. “What?” Her voice is so high pitched she grimaces at herself.</p><p>Nicky grins. “She said she gets three hundred bucks a day from her aunt to do her school work and not set fires in the girls’ bathroom. She had extra left over from yesterday. She said to tell you you’re welcome.”</p><p>Agatha puts her hands over her face. “But I don’t have any K-cups.”</p><p>Nicky chuckles and she hears his footsteps receding. “Check the cabinet.”</p><p>She uncovers her face, afraid to open the cabinet above the Keurig, and when she does, her eyes fill with tears. Boxes and boxes of different flavors of pods are stacked neatly, arranged by brand.</p>

<p>Rio lays there long after Agatha has left. Hours, probably. Until the sun comes up. Pulsing, but empty. Sated, but wanting. Tired, but far too sober.</p><p>Everything feels different with this level of clarity. The banister under her hand feels smooth. The carpet under her feet feels soft. The artwork hanging on her walls feels ostentatious. It feels like someone else’s house, bought with someone else’s money. She’s strangely detached from it as she walks down the stairs and into the kitchen for a drink.</p><p>She doesn’t let herself think about what just happened as she drains an entire bottle of rosé.</p><p>“Shocking,” comes her niece’s voice from somewhere off to the right, and she turns her head to see Valentina doing homework at the kitchen island.</p><p>“Look who’s homeformorethan five—minutes,” she slurs.</p><p>“Why would I want to be here?” Valentina asks. “You’re the worst person I’ve ever met and you treat me like garbage. Worse than garbage, actually, because you acknowledge that garbage exists.”</p><p>“The cleaners takeoutthegarbage,” Rio corrects her, one foot in front of the other as she slowly walks to the living room and opens up one of the magazines to her centerfold spread. The lines are slightly pressed from the weight of the other pages on top of them, so she has to fluff them up a bit before she can partake.</p><p>Valentina follows her. “No, what is literally wrong with you?” she shouts.</p><p>Rio squints up at her from the floor between the couch and the coffee table. “A little bit of everything.”</p><p>“I’m serious!”</p><p>And she watches in horror as Valentina leans over and blows her cocaine off the page.</p><p>Rio shrieks, and everything seems like it’s running in slow motion. Her niece picks up every single magazine and shakes them out before Rio can even get to her feet, before a thought forms in her head to try to stop it.</p><p>“Are you fucking crazy?!” she screams, finally scrambling to her feet and launching herself at her niece, because that is going too far and Rio is going to beat the living hell out of her for it. She’s apparently uncoordinated though because before she can even make contact, Valentina squares up and fucking decks her right in the mouth.</p><p>She flies backward onto the sofa, pain exploding through her jaw and up her cheekbone, and she immediately tastes blood.</p><p>Valentina jumps on her and punches her again, right under her eye, and she holds up her hands in surrender. “All right! Enough! Fuck!” Her face is lit up like a bone is broken, and when the alcohol wears off later it’s going to be absolute tragedy.</p><p>“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Valentina screams, shoving her to get leverage to stand back up, shaking out her hand. “Where’s my three hundred?”</p><p>Rio’s trembling with rage and pain at the same time, and points toward the entry table. “In my purse. Just… take what you want. There’s enough for… whatever.”</p><p>“Don’t think I won’t,” her niece says, breathing hard, brushing her hands off on her shirt and disappearing out of Rio’s line of sight.</p><p>After the door slams she feels her way over to her purse for her cell phone and calls her dealer.</p>

<p>Agatha looks up when Vee comes into the house crying. “What happened?” she asks instantly, rushing over to meet the girl, who throws herself into an embrace.</p><p>“I decked her, I’m sorry!” Vee wails.</p><p>“Oh shit,” Agatha breathes, one hand landing on Valentina’s head to stroke her hair. “It’s okay, we’ll figure it out,” she promises. “I’m sure she deserved it.”</p><p>“She was coming after me because I dusted all of her drugs!”</p><p>Agatha’s eyebrows shoot up. That was a very dangerous thing for Valentina to do. But she’ll address it when the girl is calm. “Shh, you’re safe here, okay honey? It’s okay.”</p><p>The longer they stand like that, the calmer Valentina gets, and finally she stops crying and wipes her nose with her sleeve.</p><p>“We have tissues,” she says with a grin, but honestly, when she was Vee’s age, she used her sleeve for everything.</p><p>“I’m good,” Vee says, shoving her hands in her pockets and sniffling.</p><p>“So… now that you’re calm, I think we should talk about your choices, if that’s okay with you,” Agatha says carefully.</p><p>“Where’s Nicky?”</p><p>“He’s got a hockey game tonight.”</p><p>Vee nods and takes a seat on the sofa. “I know it was stupid, I just couldn’t take it anymore. It’s all she does, you know? Drink and do coke. I just lost it and shook out all her magazines.”</p><p>Agatha blows out a slow breath and sits down next to her. “She could’ve really hurt you.”</p><p>“I don’t think—”</p><p>“Valentina,” Agatha interrupts gently.</p><p>“Shit.” Vee slumps against the back of the sofa and nods. “Yeah. Okay. She could’ve. I mean I knew she was too drunk, really, she’d just drank an entire bottle of—”</p><p>“Valentina,” Agatha says again, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Vee looks at her, face screwed up. “Yeah?”</p><p>“She could’ve hurt you. People go absolutely apeshit when their drug supply is threatened. It doesn’t matter who’s doing the threatening.”</p><p>“She did go apeshit,” Vee admits. “I’ll give you that.”</p><p>“How many times did you hit her?”</p><p>Vee surreptitiously scoots a few inches away from her. “I punched her in the face twice.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips purse in sympathy for Rio even though she absolutely fucking deserved that. However, Rio is not the issue in question, it’s a lonely, grieving teenage girl that needs guidance. “Did you need to punch her in the face twice to protect yourself?”</p><p>“No. I could’ve just shoved her and she would’ve fallen.”</p><p>“You know actions always have consequences in some way or another, right?” Agatha ventures, chewing one side of her lower lip.</p><p>“Are you mad at me?” Vee looks absolutely stricken.</p><p>“Not at all, honey,” Agatha promises. “But I think you should go to Nicky’s room for a while and think about what could have happened if you were wrong about her abilities when drunk. And no video games tonight. Okay?”</p><p>Vee’s eyes fill with tears, but Agatha doesn’t think it’s because she’s in trouble. She thinks it’s because someone gives a shit about her. “Okay,” she says, and gives Agatha another hug before she gets up and goes off to Nicky’s room.</p><p>--</p><p>By the time Nicky gets home from his hockey game, Vee’s out of his room and has admitted she took a dangerous risk, and has agreed not to play any video games for the night. They talked about what to tell Nicky when he asks why she can’t play Fortnite, and agreed she would tell him the truth about the hitting but not mention the drugs. Not that Agatha thinks he can’t handle knowing that part, but it’s just not a necessary thing to talk about.</p><p>When Vee tells him, he explodes.</p><p>“What?” He turns and looks at Agatha. “Mom, can’t you do something about it? She went after Vee!”</p><p>Agatha would love to do something about it. “I think Vee handled it,” she says, raising an eyebrow. “And I think the best thing to do is for you not to go over there alone anymore,” she says to Valentina.</p><p>“But you work, and I have to get my cash,” Vee says.</p><p>Agatha purses her lips in thought. “Can you get her to CashApp it every morning instead?”</p><p>“I can try, but I doubt she will…”</p><p>She watches as Vee sends a text, sees the frown at Rio’s response.</p><p>“She said she doesn’t have CashApp.”</p><p>“Text me her number.”</p><p>Vee looks hopeful at that, and a second later the shared contact pops up and she saves Rio’s number.</p><p><strong>A: Rio, this is Agatha. Download CashApp right now.</strong></p><p>She doesn’t get a response for a few minutes, and she knows Rio got the text because she’d responded to Vee right away. She’s ready to send a follow up when her phone beeps.</p><p><strong>R: go fckyoursef</strong></p><p>What did she expect, really? She knows from Vee’s account of events that Rio is trashed on an entire bottle of something. She’s surprised the lush got that many letters right, actually.</p><p>She sends a gif of a lighter flicking open and a flame withering on the screen.</p><p><strong>R: ur stupid fiine idid it</strong></p><p>Agatha smirks and sends a voice note.</p><p>“Set up your bank account so you can send Valentina $300 dollars every morning and she doesn’t have to put herself at risk coming by to get your cash.”</p><p><strong>R: she tellu she punchdmynface</strong></p><p><strong>A: She did. And you deserved it. Did you set up the recurring transfer yet?</strong></p><p><strong>R: fuckyo</strong></p><p><strong>A: Did you, Rio? Don’t make me ask again.</strong></p><p><strong>R: Y</strong></p><p><strong>A: Is that a yes?</strong></p><p><strong>R: yesnindid ti</strong></p><p>“Jesus fucking Christ,” she mutters under her breath.</p><p>Nicky eyes her sideways, not used to hearing that kind of language from her, but says nothing about it. “Vee really can’t play Fortnite with me?” he asks instead.</p><p>“She really can’t,” Agatha confirms.</p><p>“But that’s punishing me,” he complains. “And I’m perfect.”</p><p>Vee snorts and nudges him. “You could always shut off the PS5 for one night,” she suggests.</p><p>Agatha’s brain does a good impression of a sports car smashing into a wall. “The what?”</p><p>“There’s better optimization, graphics, streaming speed,” Vee says. “I wanted Nicky to have one. And I took a couple grand out of Aunt Rio’s purse when she said I could take whatever.”</p><p>Agatha gasps. “Vee this has to stop,” she says, eyes wide. “You cannot be buying things for me and Nicky like this.”</p><p>“Then I guess it’s probably not a good time to tell you I threw out your ratty ass lawnmower and got you a ride-on one…”</p><p>“Valentina!” Agatha jumps to her feet. “No more! Okay? No more.”</p><p>“I’m not gonna agree to that, Agatha,” Valentina says. “You said I can’t contribute by paying rent, but you can’t stop me from contributing how I want to.”</p><p>“I absolutely can deactivate your CashApp account,” Agatha threatens. She doesn’t want to have to do that, but she can’t have Valentina going around making household purchases for her house.</p><p>“Why the fuck would you do that?” Vee shouts, and the anguish in her voice makes Agatha feel awful. “She’s got money coming out her fucking ass and you’re struggling working two jobs with broken shit everywhere, letting a whole ‘nother ass person basically live here without asking anything in return, and when she wants to do something to help, you flip your shit and start threatening her? What the <em>fuck</em>, Agatha?”</p><p>“Okay, there’s a lot to unpack there, but Vee, I don’t argue with teenagers the way your aunt does, so please don’t shout and cuss at me. I’ll listen to everything you have to say, I promise. You don’t have to rush it out like that. Can we take a step back?”</p><p>Valentina’s fuming, and Agatha can see her processing the information, clenching and unclenching her hands, eyes tracking something seen only in her mind.</p><p>The girl slowly calms and relaxes her hands. “Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. My bad, I just…” She trails off, looking helplessly at Agatha.</p><p>“It’s okay. Thank you for respecting my boundaries,” Agatha says. “I love that you want to help out, Vee, it’s honestly very touching and sweet and thoughtful of you. But I’m the adult, I’m supposed to be the provider, and having a seventeen-year-old buying lawnmowers and Keurigs makes me feel like I’m a complete failure at being a provider.”</p><p>“Why? She doesn’t need all that money so what’s the difference? You’re not failing at being a provider. You provide everything Nicky needs. I’m getting the stuff that’s extra. The stuff nobody <em>needs</em> but is nice to have.”</p><p>“I—” Agatha stops talking and stares at her, because she’s not wrong. And maybe not wanting Vee to buy stuff for the house is more of a <em>her</em> issue than a real issue. If it makes Valentina feel good, and feel like she’s contributing to a household she wants to be a part of, Agatha should probably overlook her insecurities and just… let it happen. “I guess you’re right,” she finally says. “I didn’t think of it that way. I’m sorry I threatened your CashApp account, I should have thought it through and found a better way to communicate with you.”</p><p>Vee relaxes even more and nods, leaning over to hug her.</p><p>“Let’s make a deal, though. You can only buy things you directly benefit from. Acceptable?”</p><p>“Is that your way of saying it’s now my job to mow the lawn?”</p><p>Agatha snorts out a laugh, peering down at her in the hug. “Yes. Yes it is,” she lies obviously.</p><p>“Deal,” Vee says.</p><p>Now Agatha just has to decide whether to confront Rio or let this one go since Vee already decked her. It’s not an easy choice, really. She doesn’t want to overstimulate, but she really wants that control. Ugh. That is entirely the wrong reason to confront her.</p><p>She shouldn’t go over there again until her motivations are right. She just doesn’t know if she can wait… because there’s a hole in her head the size of a train wrecked rich girl that can only be filled one way.</p><p>--</p><p>She lasts ten minutes. TEN MINUTES. That’s as pathetic as Rio. She’s in the car on her way before she can de-rationalize her behavior.</p><p>There’s no music coming from inside the house, so probably no party, which is odd given it’s early evening.</p><p>When she knocks, she hears Rio’s voice shouting “Go away, I don’t want any!”</p><p>She tries the door anyway, and it swings open. She finds Rio in the living room with a scrawny, pockmarked man – she spread out on the sofa and he knelt over the coffee table cutting up lines.</p><p>Probably her dealer, since Vee had dusted her stash.</p><p>She shoves her hands into her pockets and steps down from the foyer into the living room. “Take a hike,” she tells the dealer.</p><p>Rio groans and rolls her eyes exaggeratedly. “Fuck off, Agatha.”</p><p>The dealer’s on his feet already. “This bitch a problem for you RiRi?”</p><p><em>RiRi? Oh, gaaaaawd</em>.</p><p>“Yeah baby she is,” Rio pouts.</p><p>Agatha throws her a look but doesn’t have time to comment before she’s got a glock leveled at her chest. She can see the safety on but there’s no way Rio would notice that, and she wonders what Rio will do.</p><p>Turns out Rio finds it hilarious. She throws her head back, exposing her pulsing throat as she erupts into cackling laughter. “Shoot her, baby… Make my life easier.”</p><p>“Kinda hard to shoot somebody with the safety on,” Agatha says, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>The dealer grins, and christ he’s got like ten teeth max, and tucks his glock back into his waistband. “Just playin’, girl. Peace.” He flashes her the peace sign and gives Rio a mock salute before bobbing out the door, not bothering to close it behind him.</p><p>“How is it that <em>you</em> still have all your teeth?” she asks Rio, because the burning curiosity is more pressing than her burning anger.</p><p>“Perfect dental hygiene and my very own oral surgeon,” Rio drawls. “What do you want?”</p><p>Agatha ignores the question, her anger now taking precedence. “You were gonna let him shoot me?”</p><p>Rio levels her with a sociopathic stare. “I never said come in, so…” She shrugs. “You’re trespassing.”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes and leans down, bracketing her hands on either side of Rio’s head. “You would have let him shoot me?”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flare, and she lifts her chin in defiance, but something in her eyes says the question makes her uncomfortable. “Absolutely.”</p><p>Agatha leans down closer, lips at Rio’s ear. “You’re lying.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>Rio’s lips brush <em>her</em> ear and she rockets upright. This is spiraling fast.</p><p>Rio is sprawled like a rag doll, one leg hanging half off the sofa, her head on the armrest at what cannot be a comfortable angle, and her arms splayed out to her sides. She smells like booze and the faint trace of cigarette smoke, her eye makeup is blurred like she’s been sweating it off, and yet still Agatha wants her.</p><p>“How’s your face, sugar?” she asks to get some distance.</p><p>“Can’t feel a thing,” Rio says with a loud sigh and a languid stretch.</p><p>Agatha feels an unholy rage start bubbling up from the pit of her stomach. She’s had <em>enough</em> of the indifference. So in a move her much younger self would have been proud of but her current self definitely judges her for doing, she swipes Rio’s drugs off the coffee table, sending them up in a cloud of dust.</p><p>There’s an earsplitting howl, and the next thing she knows, she’s dodging the coffee table, which clips her in the arm on its way past and crashes into the wall. She looks behind her in shock, then turns back around just in time to duck a flying lamp. The bulb shatters when it impacts the window behind her, and Agatha grabs Rio by the forearms, forcing her to sit back down on the sofa.</p><p>“Stop!” she shouts as Rio fights the hold, drug-assisted fury fueling her strength.</p><p>But Agatha’s stronger. She keeps Rio seated.</p><p>“Get the fuck out of my house,” Rio snarls.</p><p>“What the fuck is wrong with you?” Agatha asks, winded.</p><p>Rio laughs and clicks her tongue against her teeth. “You forgot your magic wand.”</p><p>“Wh—the tie?” Agatha asks, baffled at that response.</p><p>Rio trills out another laugh, glossy red lips split in an overly giddy grin.</p><p>“You threw a coffee table at me because I didn’t bring my fucking tie?”</p><p>The amusement vanishes. “I threw a coffee table at you because you wasted my drugs. Get out of my house. Now.”</p><p>“I wasted your drugs because you were being a fucking cunt,” Agatha says, still trying to wrap her head around this conversation. She thinks it’s safe to let go of Rio’s arms now, so she does, and steps back.</p><p>“I don’t care why you did it, it’s probably gonna take half an hour to get Jed back here. So you wasted my drugs <em>and</em> my time. Seriously, get out.”</p><p>She’s been told to leave three times now, she really can’t stay. “His name is Jed?” she mutters on her way to the door. It’s still open from when <em>Jed</em> had left. She’s about to step through it when Rio snaps at her.</p><p>“Where are you going?”</p><p>“What? You told me to leave.”</p><p>“Yeah, well, since when do you care what I want?”</p><p>“So you’re… not kicking me out of your house?” She should leave anyway. One foot in front of the other, Agatha. Do not engage.</p><p>“Not until you fix my coffee table.”</p><p>Agatha forces down her irritation and leaves the house, shutting the door behind her, and she’s in her car driving off before she sees Rio fling the door open and step out onto the porch, yelling after her.</p><p>She can’t hear the words over the car’s engine, and she doesn’t bother stopping to find out what they are.</p><p>Halfway home her adrenaline has worn off and her arm finally catches her attention. She looks it over at a red light, eyes widening because there’s a tear in her blouse and her arm is bleeding.</p><p>Jesus. She’d barely felt anything when it happened. She’ll have to throw on a jacket to hide it from the kids until she can clean it up.</p>

<p>“Fuckin’ piss me off and make me throw shit and don’t even pick it up!” Rio’s screaming out her front door as Agatha drives away. When the other woman doesn’t stop, she stomps back inside and slams the door, then fixes the coffee table herself and puts all her magazines back on it. She ignores the broken glass for now, because whenever her cleaners are here next they’ll get it. What day even is it? Ugh, who cares.</p><p>And now she can’t even be bothered to get Jed back over because she’s tired and wants a nap, and he’ll take forever and she doesn’t want to wait up.</p><p>She trudges up the stairs and burrows under the blankets in bed, because it’s cold, too, but she doesn’t want to go back downstairs and adjust the thermostat.</p><p>Pouting at the misfortune of the last two days, she drifts off thinking about throwing more furniture at Agatha.</p><p>--</p><p>When she wakes up, it’s dark outside, and she should have set an alarm, because Jed’s not going to come over after dark, he’s got a family or something blah blah blah. And the last time she got blow from somebody else it was cut with way too much other shit, so she’s just gonna have to wait until tomorrow. Fucking figures. Goddamn Agatha. What right does that woman think she has? Barging into Rio’s life demanding things left and right, humiliating her, making her feel things. Making her want things. Making her do things.</p><p>The memories of what Agatha has made her do wash over her and she groans, because now that she knows what it feels like to be affected by someone, she fears she’s hopelessly hooked.</p><p>She should apologize, and maybe Agatha would come back. She’s not actually sorry, but saying sorry might work in her favor?</p><p>Does she really want Agatha to come back, though? Hooked or not, their interactions are very bad for Rio’s self-imposed prison of mental isolation. Her dead black heart beats when Agatha’s in the room, and that’s the most terrifying thing of all. She’s absolutely fucking desperate to ignite that spark while being absolutely fucking desperate to snuff it out.</p><p>She wanders down to get her phone and flops on the sofa, and tries to decide what to say. Maybe if she types it like ‘sry’ it will look like she’s making less effort than she is.</p><p>That’s what she’ll do then.</p><p><strong>R: sry can u come back</strong></p><p>There’s no answer right away, which is annoying, so she takes her phone off of silent and puts it on the coffee table, then picks it up again to order something to eat, and oh shit, she has like how long to get food in the house? She can’t remember when that nosy ass lady was here.</p><p>So after she orders a salad, she puts in a grocery delivery order with a bunch of meat, fruits, and vegetables. None of which she’s likely to eat, and she has no idea what her niece likes to eat, but at least Valentina won’t get taken to foster care and rat her out to the cops.</p><p>She’s halfway through her salad when her phone dings from the other room, and her stomach flips at the thought it might be Agatha responding so she deliberately finishes her food and cleans up before going to check her messages.</p><p><strong>A: Fuck all the way off.</strong></p><p>Rio frowns at the phone.</p><p><strong>R: i said sry</strong></p><p><strong>A: I don’t care what the fuck you said. Don’t text me again, I won’t respond.</strong></p><p><strong>R: thats not nice</strong></p><p>She gets no response.</p><p><strong>R: come over</strong></p><p>No response.</p><p>She chews her lip trying to think up something that will bend the other woman to her will.</p><p><strong>R: plz ill let u boss me arnd</strong></p><p>No response.</p><p><strong>R: do u want me to beg</strong></p><p>No response.</p><p>Frustrated, she tosses down the phone.</p><p>Five minutes later she picks it up again.</p><p><strong>R: why dont you want me</strong></p><p>Agatha still doesn’t respond, and Rio feels invisible. She hates being ignored more than anything else. It sets her back to childhood memories best left buried. She’s an adult now, and she’s much harder to ignore. Except Agatha’s doing a good fucking job of it. If she knew where Agatha lived, she would drive over there right now.</p><p>But she doesn’t.</p><p>So she can’t.</p><p>She can’t do anything but text.</p><p>So she decides to do a lot of that.</p><p><strong>R: fine ill beg</strong></p><p><strong>R: please come over</strong></p><p><strong>R: you wreck me</strong></p><p><strong>R: no ones ever caught my interest b4</strong></p><p><strong>R: i think abt u all the time</strong></p><p><strong>R: i dream abt u</strong></p><p><strong>R: id live on my knees 4 u</strong></p><p><strong>R: jed never shot any1</strong></p><p><strong>R: i knew he wouldnt</strong></p><p><strong>R: i was just mad at u</strong></p><p><strong>R: bc u barged in2 my life and fckd me up</strong></p><p><strong>R: idek what 2 do now</strong></p><p><strong>R: im ruined</strong></p><p><strong>R: i hope ur happy</strong></p><p><strong>R: plz say sthg</strong></p><p>And finally, after exhausting all other avenues of possible reparations, she comes to the conclusion that she’s going to have to give Agatha a real apology.</p><p><strong>R: im sorry i let you think i was going to let him shoot you. i wouldnt have if i thought there was any chance hed do it. please say something agatha im honestly trying so hard right now</strong></p><p>If Agatha doesn’t say something soon, she’s going to lose her fucking mind.</p>

<p>Nicky and Vee both keep looking at her every time her phone goes off. Which happens about five million times in a row. She reads the messages on the lock screen but she’s not even going to unlock the phone. She already said she wasn’t going to respond, so Rio can suck a fucking dick.</p><p>“Oh my God!” Vee finally explodes, throwing her hands up in the air.</p><p>“Seriously mom, who is that? And why aren’t you answering?”</p><p>“It’s someone I told to stop texting me, that’s why I’m not answering,” Agatha mutters. “Don’t worry about it.”</p><p>“Can you put it on silent or something? Kind of hard to watch a movie when every other word is ‘DING!’,” Vee complains.</p><p>“Sorry,” Agatha says, pulling a face, and flicks down the lever to silence her phone. Not sure why she hadn’t done that sooner. Distracted, maybe.</p><p>“Thank you,” Vee says, rolling her eyes.</p><p>When Rio sends an actual apology, Agatha is torn. She said she wasn’t going to answer, but… Rio seems about to spiral, and maybe it can be an opportunity.</p><p>Biting her lip in indecision, she weighs her options for a few minutes and then unlocks the phone, navigating to the messages.</p><p><strong>A: Rio, I told you to stop texting me. I’m not going to talk to you tonight. You crossed a line and I’m upset with you. If you are still sober tomorrow morning, I will come by before work so we can talk. For tonight, please respect the fact that I don’t want to text anymore.</strong></p><p>She’s still biting her lip as she waits for Rio’s response. Her stomach churning. Because if she’s honest with herself, Rio’s response means more to her than she wants to admit. Is she worth staying sober overnight for? Probably not, so she should prepare herself for Rio to flip out and tell her where she can shove it, but—</p><p><strong>R: ok</strong></p><p>Agatha’s heart skips and she covers her mouth with one hand to hide her sharper-than-usual inhale.</p><p>Of course, Rio could still get shit faced even after agreeing to her terms, but an agreement is at least promising, isn’t it?</p><p>Fuck, she should really be running in the opposite direction.</p><p>But she won’t. She knows she won’t.</p><p>Because she might be just as addicted as Rio.</p><p>--</p><p>At five am, ready to head out the door if Rio’s still coherent, Agatha sends her a text.</p><p><strong>A: Are you still sober?</strong></p><p>It takes a few minutes and she thinks she probably woke Rio up, because the woman is never up before noon.</p><p><strong>R: yes</strong></p><p><strong>A: Prove it. Say something that makes sense.</strong></p><p><strong>R: i usually sleep w my ringer off but i put it on loud so id hear u txt</strong></p><p>Agatha’s heart does a little somersault and she forcibly tells it to stop, brows drawing down in a deep-set frown. Not advisable to get attached as well as addicted. Two very different Pandora’s boxes.</p><p><strong>A: I’m on my way.</strong></p><p><strong>R: ok see u soon</strong></p><p>--</p><p>Agatha knocks on the door and Rio opens it about thirty seconds later – she must’ve been waiting downstairs.</p><p>She looks beautiful, honestly, in a dark blue silk bathrobe with cherry blossoms patterned all over it, hair pulled into a messy bun, bare feet, and a fingernail in her mouth.</p><p>She’s nervous, Agatha realizes. For the first time, she can read a genuine emotion in Rio’s body language that’s not masked by intoxication of some sort.</p><p>“Don’t chew your fingernail,” she says, but Rio keeps doing it and steps back to let her in. She enters the house and after Rio shuts the door behind her, she gently tugs on the other woman’s wrist. “Don’t. Your nails are too pretty to ruin.”</p><p>Rio clasps her hands together and puts them between her thighs, squeezing. “I have to do <em>something</em>, I’m crawling out of my skin.”</p><p>“Well you can start with an apology face to face, and make it good enough to keep me talking.”</p><p>Rio looks surprised, but she apologizes. “I’m sorry I let you think I wouldn’t have stopped him from shooting you,” she says. “And for the things I said when you asked me about it. And—and for telling him it would make my life easier.”</p><p>Agatha nods and walks toward the living room, taking a seat on the sofa, and Rio follows, sitting on the opposite end. Chewing her nail again. “Why did you say those things?”</p><p>Rio talks around the cherry red fingernail. “I was mad.”</p><p>“No, I get that,” Agatha says, resisting the urge to roll her eyes. “But why?”</p><p>“Because like I said last night, you barged into my life and fucked me up,” Rio admits. “Then you just keep walking away and I don’t know… I’m not… I don’t know how to do this.”</p><p>“Do what?”</p><p>“Feel things,” Rio says, shrugging one shoulder. “Want things.”</p><p>“You don’t want things?” Agatha asks, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“What could I possibly want? I have everything. At least… I thought I had everything. Before you came along and flipped me on my fucking head.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart starts to race a little. “And now?”</p><p>Rio shrugs again. “Now? I guess I know how it feels to crave something besides drugs. Something I can only have in small doses when it suits her.”</p><p>“Do you have any idea why I came over here that first night?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Think.”</p><p>“You came over to tell me how pathetic I am.”</p><p>“But why? Why would I do that? <em>Think</em>, Rio.”</p><p>Rio’s forehead wrinkles and her lips purse, and she stops chewing her fingernail. “Because you don’t like me?”</p><p>Agatha scoots closer and puts a finger under Rio’s chin, barely touching. “Why don’t I like you, Rio? What did I know about you before we ever met?”</p><p>“I don’t know. Only whatever Valentina told you.”</p><p>Agatha waits for her to make the connection, and when she does, her frown deepens.</p><p>“You don’t like me because Valentina doesn’t like me?”</p><p>Agatha’s about to blow a gasket. “Rio, stop being so goddamn selfish and only seeing things from one perspective. What would Valentina have told me about you to make me dislike you before ever having met you?”</p><p>“How the fuck would I know what she told you?”</p><p>Rio really has no idea she’s done anything wrong. Agatha has her work cut out for her. “How do you think I felt when she told me you have parties all hours of the night? Strange men in the house with a teenage girl trying to sleep? Or that you order food for yourself and leave her to figure something else out, because there’s nothing to eat in your kitchen? Or that you have drugs littering the coffee table twenty-four hours a day that she could just lean over and sniff if she felt like it? She is seventeen years old, Rio, not twenty-seven. Her parents have just been ripped from her, leaving her grieving and alone. The only person she had before she met Nicky was you. And how did you treat her? What did you do when she came into your home, mourning the loss of the two people she loved most in the world? Did you hug her and tell her it would all be okay? Did you listen to her feelings about her parents? About the change in her life? About how she was uprooted from her friends, from her city, her school, and thrown into the utter chaos that is your home? Did you even look at her, Rio? Did you show her which bedroom she could have? Help her get her possessions into it? Or did you pretend she didn’t exist because you only viewed her as an inconvenience?”</p><p>For a second, one split second, Agatha sees recognition in those wide brown eyes, sees understanding that she’s done wrong, but it disappears like lightning and Rio shoots up off the sofa.</p><p>“I didn’t ask for this!” she shouts.</p><p>Agatha gets up and grabs her by the arms, shaking her. “She didn’t ask for this either,” she says, chasing that spark of humanity. “But you’ve both got it, and only one of you is acting like a spoiled, brain dead asshole.”</p><p>Rio tries to get out of her grip, but when she fails, her eyes fill with tears.</p><p>Agatha jumps on the opportunity. “She just lost her entire world, Rio. Don’t you remember what it feels like to lose something you love?”</p><p>“No,” Rio whispers. “I’ve never loved anything.” A tear slides down her cheek.</p><p>That’s heartbreaking, because Agatha thinks she really means it. She’s thrown off for a second, but regroups. “But you can,” she says almost gently. “You can love her.”</p><p>“I don’t know how.” Another tear escapes and trails down her face.</p><p>“That’s where I come in,” Agatha tells her, letting go of one arm to catch a tear with her thumb and wipe it away. “I can help you.”</p><p>“I’m not gonna just magically be perfect,” Rio says, pulling away.</p><p>Agatha lets her withdraw this time. “You don’t have to be perfect, Rio. I don’t expect you to wake up tomorrow and be sober for the rest of your life. All you have to do is try, little by little. That’s what I can help you do.”</p><p>Rio looks at her, tears continuing to fall. “I am going to fail your every single expectation,” she promises.</p><p>“I’m fairly certain I know how to properly motivate you,” Agatha responds with a quirky grin.</p><p>Rio doesn’t smile. “What’s in it for you?”</p><p>“Besides ensuring Valentina has a loving home in the near future?” She steps up close again, dropping her lips to Rio’s ear. “You’re pretty, Rio,” she purrs.</p><p>She hears the sharp intake of breath that signals Rio is receptive to the answer. “You’re gonna bribe me with sex?”</p><p>“No, sugar,” Agatha drawls, stepping back as she pulls her tie out of her pocket and stretches it between her hands like a rubber band. “With my tie.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes go unfocused.</p><p>“You didn’t think I’d forget it twice, did you?” Agatha teases, lifting it over Rio’s head and settling it around her neck, tightening it up, but running a finger between the band and Rio’s skin to make sure it isn’t <em>too</em> tight.</p><p>Rio stands there and lets her.</p><p>Agatha slowly runs a finger down the front of it, then just as slowly curls her hand around it until she’s clutching it tightly in a fist. She stands like that, staring into Rio’s blown eyes, for several minutes, and then suddenly jerks downward to get Rio on her hands and knees.</p><p>Rio cries out as she lands, head falling forward between her elbows, back arching as she moans. “I would’ve gone down for you,” she gasps.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha tuts. “Don’t question my methods.”</p><p>“Sorry, I just—”</p><p>“Quiet.”</p><p>Rio falls silent.</p><p>“Speak when spoken to.”</p><p>Rio throws her head back so she can look up at Agatha, eyes on fire.</p><p>“Tell me what a bad guardian you’ve been.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks instantly flush and she seems to decide looking at Agatha was a bad idea, because she ducks her head between her arms again. “I’ve been a bad guardian,” she says, her tone lacking any real affect.</p><p>Agatha picks up one of the magazines off the coffee table and rolls it up, then swats Rio on the shoulder with it. “Do better than that. Tell me what you’ve done. And what you haven’t.”</p><p>Rio angles her shoulder away from the swat briefly, then returns to a balanced position. “I didn’t order food for Valentina when I ordered for myself,” she says.</p><p>“And why was that bad?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“Because she was probably hungry,” Rio says, and there’s a slight note of misery in her voice now that Agatha regards as progress.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says, her tone clipped. “Next.”</p><p>“I had drugs on the coffee table,” Rio says, for the first time sounding infinitesimally regretful. “That was bad because Valentina is only seventeen and she could’ve taken some.”</p><p>“What might have happened to her if she’d done some of your drugs?” Agatha asks, putting Rio’s thought process to the test on that one.</p><p>There’s no answer for a minute, and then when it comes, Rio’s voice is a little choked. “She could’ve had a bad reaction. Or got addicted. Or—or died.”</p><p>Agatha crouches down in front of her and grabs her by the hair, fingers winding around that messy bun, and lifts her head. “That’s right,” she says. “And that would have been your fault. Do you understand that?”</p><p>Rio whimpers, but answers. “Yes.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says, dropping her head and standing. “Next.”</p><p>“I had parties even after Valentina came to live here, and that was bad because that meant strange men in the house with a teenage girl, and loud music while she was trying to sleep for school,” Rio says, her voice gaining more affect with each subsequent confession.</p><p>“What might have happened to her if she didn’t go out and buy herself a lock for her bedroom door?” Agatha asks.</p><p>Rio’s head drops lower as her shoulders sag. “She could’ve been assaulted. And that would have been my fault.”</p><p>Rio is a quick learner, Agatha thinks. “Good girl. Next.”</p><p>“I didn’t tell her everything would be okay,” Rio says, and it’s a whisper. “That was bad because she just lost her parents and she was depending on me to help her feel less alone, and I didn’t. I didn’t do anything.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says. “Anything else you can think of?”</p><p>“I didn’t get up to take her to school in the mornings. I don’t even know how she’s been getting there. That’s bad because… if she has to walk anywhere it might not be safe.”</p><p>Agatha’s impressed with that one, because it wasn’t something she had mentioned in her earlier tirade. Rio came up with that on her own. “Good girl,” she says, and this time she lets a note of pride into her voice. She can tell that Rio hears the difference because her back stiffens. She’s gotten through the important part. Now for the fun part. “Tell me <em>why</em> you did nothing to help your niece.”</p><p>Rio understands instantly, her head picking up, wild eyes finding Agatha’s. “Because I’m selfish.”</p><p>Agatha can see the shudder wrack her body. “Mm. What else are you, Rio?”</p><p>“I’m spoiled,” Rio says, breathing hard.</p><p>“Come on, you can do better than that. What else are you, Rio?”</p><p>“I’m pathetic,” Rio moans softly. “A self-centered slut.”</p><p>“Oh yes, you are,” Agatha agrees, starting to walk a slow circle around her. She stops directly behind Rio. “What else?”</p><p>“I’m a—a drug-addled waste of space,” Rio says.</p><p>Agatha steps forward and sits carefully on Rio’s back, keeping most of her weight on her feet, letting just enough of her body mass settle to make the girl feel <em>ridden</em>, and reaches down in front of her to grab the tie, pulling it up to choke her a little.</p><p>Rio cries out and rears her head back, but she does nothing to attempt escape.</p><p>“You are all of those things,” Agatha says, “but you <em>will</em> do better.”</p><p>Rio whines and pulls forward with her throat to make Agatha choke her harder.</p><p>Agatha lets go of the tie and grabs Rio’s hair instead. “Say it,” she hisses.</p><p>“I’ll do better,” Rio splutters, coughing.</p><p>“You have five seconds to make me believe it or I’ll choke you out entirely and walk out that door.”</p><p>Rio’s still coughing but she scrambles to obey, her fingers digging into the carpet. “I will, I’ll do better,” she rasps out, sucking in air. “I promise I’ll do better, I promise!”</p><p>Agatha believes her. She climbs off of Rio’s back and stands in front of her. “Put the tie in your mouth and crawl up the stairs.”</p><p>Rio’s shaking so badly she almost can’t comply, but Agatha is patient, waiting to walk away until the tie is between those perfect teeth, and then walks behind Rio as she crawls.</p><p>She knows exactly what she wants from upstairs, and when they reach the top, she grabs Rio’s hips to stop her.</p><p>“Wait there,” she says, and goes into Rio’s bedroom, over to the vanity, and picks up a very ornate, very <em>heavy</em> antique silver hairbrush. The kind with soft bristles, that Rio probably only uses after her hair is already brushed, to shine it.</p><p>That thought makes her wonder more about Rio’s daily routines. Does she sit at the vanity and brush her gorgeous hair? Does she do her makeup here? What time does she wake up, and is it to an alarm or does she just sleep until she wakes up naturally?</p><p>She runs her fingers over the designs on the back of the brush, biting her lip, because this is going to hurt Rio.</p><p>She goes to the doorway and motions Rio over, and watches Rio crawl toward her, teeth still gritted on the tie. So very obedient with her training totem in place.</p><p>“Rewards and consequences,” she says when Rio stops in front of her. She leans down and drags her finger over the part of the tie that’s not between clenched teeth. “Rewards.” She stands up and traces a fingertip over the back of the hairbrush. “Consequences.”</p><p>Rio makes a noise like an angry bull, nostrils flaring, but she doesn’t relinquish her hold on the tie to speak. Her eyes are wide and she shakes her head.</p><p>Whether it’s an actual protest or a token one, Agatha doesn’t know, nor does she care. “Yes,” she says in response either way. She drags the vanity chair into the middle of the bedroom and sits, patting her thighs.</p><p>Rio crawls a few paces closer but stops and shakes her head again.</p><p>“Don’t make me tell you three times, sugar.”</p><p>Rio whines and crawls closer, then climbs over her lap.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha whispers, running a hand up the back of Rio’s thighs, pulling the silk robe up with it.</p><p>Rio puts her hands on the floor to balance, and Agatha drags her thong down her legs, letting it rest around her knees.</p><p>The sound Rio makes is… decadent. And the smell of her arousal is even more decadent than that. It’s hard not to tell her how good she smells. It’s making Agatha’s mouth water. “You’re so wet, aren’t you?” she croons. “About to be punished… you like that, Rio?”</p><p>Rio shakes her head and Agatha laughs.</p><p>“No? No you’re not wet, or no you don’t like the fact that I’m about to light your ass up like the fourth of July?”</p><p>Rio whines and squirms on her lap, and it’s the most delicious combination of things.</p><p>“Would it help if I told you I’m wet too, sugar?”</p><p>Rio groans and the tie slips out of her mouth. “Agatha, please, god, I don’t even know—”</p><p>“You want me to leave?”</p><p>“No,” Rio says, almost a shout. “I just—I—ugh!”</p><p>Apparently she doesn’t know what she ‘just’ because she stops talking.</p><p>“You just what?” Agatha prompts, rubbing a hand over Rio’s bare ass.</p><p>Rio shivers and turns her head to look up at Agatha over her shoulder. “I just don’t want you to see me like this,” she huffs, dropping her head back down.</p><p>“Like what?” Agatha asks, nonplussed. Of all the things…? This is the one she objects to?</p><p>“Like… I don’t know, immature or something! I’m draped over your lap like a kid!”</p><p>Agatha throws her head back and laughs. “Your position over my lap is not the thing that makes me see you as immature,” she promises. “You’ve done that with your words and actions since the moment we met.” She lets that sink in for a minute and then continues. “And I assure you, the punishment you are about to get will be entirely adult in nature.”</p><p>Rio just whines.</p><p>“Now, if you’re done stalling, get the tie back in your mouth so I can proceed.”</p><p>The weight on her thighs increases for a bit while Rio picks her hands up off the floor and balances, getting the tie back between her teeth. Then she settles back down, and Agatha picks up the hairbrush from where she’d set it half underneath herself.</p><p>She lets Rio adjust to what’s coming for a marginal amount of seconds, then raises her arm and cracks the hairbrush soundly across Rio’s left cheek.</p><p>Rio’s shocked, pained yelp is music to her ears. Her ass is flawless and buoyant and the hairbrush would bounce right off if it was lighter, but the heavy silver it’s made of allows it to make an impact and stay put.</p><p>When she’s ready, she lifts it from Rio’s backside, her heart racing at the intricate pattern raised in red on Rio’s skin. It’s like a gothic interpretation of a fleur-de-lis.</p><p>Stifling a groan, Agatha raises her arm again and brings the hairbrush down sharply on Rio’s other cheek, the crack resounding in her ears like a shot.</p><p>Rio howls, the tie tumbling out of her mouth, and Agatha spanks her again in the same spot. Harder.</p><p>“Get that tie back in your fucking mouth,” she scolds, and Rio’s frantic to comply, breath heaving, whimpers trailing after the initial howling yell, and she gets the tie back in her mouth, dropping down again. “Every time that tie comes out I add ten,” Agatha snaps.</p><p>Rio vehemently shakes her head.</p><p>Agatha raises her arm and delivers another stinging blow, the fleur-de-lis-shaped welts overlapping each other, turning Rio’s smooth skin into a beautiful mess of red lines and curves.</p><p>Rio screams the best she can with her teeth gritted, and Agatha lays into her now, one after another after another, crisp and heavy and relentless, paying close attention to Rio’s breathing underneath the screams.</p><p>When Rio is sobbing too loudly for Agatha to gauge her breathing, she stops and sets the hairbrush on the floor. Some of the welts are underlaid by forming bruises, glaring and purple and mottled, and it will be hell on earth to sit down for the rest of the day.</p><p>She puts her hand under the robe to rub Rio’s back, and when the more violent sobs die down, the other woman is still a miserable, crying, squirming wreck.</p><p>Agatha is patient, as always, and lets her cry for as long as she needs to, just rubbing up and down her back. It takes a very long time for Rio to go still and quiet. Long enough that Agatha’s ass is numb from sitting in the same position.</p><p>When Rio stops squirming and crying, Agatha speaks softly to her. “Can you stand?”</p><p>“I don’t—know,” Rio stammers. “Maybe—maybe if you help me.”</p><p>Agatha puts her arms around Rio to lift her and helps her to her feet. Rio’s panties slide the rest of the way down and she carefully steps out of them, her face twisted with discomfort as she moves her legs.</p><p>Her face is a mess. Mascara’s bleeding all the way down to her jaw, her eyes are red and puffy, and some hair that fell out of her bun is plastered to her forehead with sweat.</p><p>Agatha brushes the hair off of her forehead and guides her toward the bed with a hand on her lower back. “Take off your robe baby and up on your stomach.”</p>

<p>Rio stumbles and falls forward over the bed when Agatha calls her baby. She can feel the tension behind her, because she doesn’t think Agatha meant to say it. And she doesn’t want anything to ruin the moment so she pretends she didn’t notice. “On—on my stomach?” she says, just to have something to say, and crawls carefully onto the bed.</p><p>But her head is spinning. No one has ever called her that. Never came close. It fills her with the sharpest anxiety at the same time it blankets her with the most comforting warmth she can imagine. And then there’s a tinge of excitement thrown in.</p><p>She lays on her stomach, shaking, her ass throbbing like a nuclear test site and stinging like it’s on literal fire. Her heartbeat is pounding in her ears and every nerve is a live wire.</p><p>“Take your robe off,” Agatha says again, and Rio pulls one arm out of the sleeve, then tosses it over her back so she can slide it off of her other arm.</p><p>She feels the mattress dip beside her and then Agatha is stretched out, propped on her side, up on one elbow.</p><p>Every breath makes the pain radiate outward from her abused ass, and every few breaths she can’t fight off a pained shudder.</p><p>“You don’t have to be perfect,” Agatha tells her, and she feels a hand on her back, rubbing again, slowly up and down. She tries to relax into it. “But you are going to do better, aren’t you?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says, her voice hoarse and scratchy. She can’t remember the last time she cried like that. If she ever has. She knows she won’t meet Agatha’s expectations but she will try to do better. Although from the sound of Agatha’s earlier scolding, she’s got nowhere to go but up.</p><p>“You were very good for your consequences,” Agatha says after a few minutes of silence, and Rio’s breath catches, a tiny moan filtering out.</p><p>She will never understand why Agatha calling her good affects her so deeply, but it does. It reaches into parts of her she’s never experienced and didn’t know existed and turns them on like the flip of a switch. “I tried,” she croaks.</p><p>“You did,” Agatha repeats, and the hand on her back slides higher and eases into her hair, and oh god that feels divine. “You didn’t try to get up, not once. I know how hard that must have been. I know how much that spanking hurt.”</p><p>Rio’s face goes hot at the word ‘spanking’, embarrassment flooding her body, and she closes her eyes against it. “Can you call it a beating or something?” she asks, with no real hope that Agatha will honor the request.</p><p>But to her surprise, Agatha doesn’t laugh it off or refuse. “It was more of a beating, wasn’t it? Well, either way, I know how much it hurt, but you laid there and took it like a good girl, didn’t you?”</p><p>Oh. She’s supposed to participate in this praise? That’s new. She’s used to participating in her own degradation, but… yeah, this is new. She tries it out on her tongue. “Yes, I—I did,” she says hesitantly. It feels strange, but overwhelmingly nice.</p><p>“Do you like having your hair played with?”</p><p>“No one ever has, but so far, yes, very much.”</p><p>“Can I take out the bun?”</p><p>“<em>That</em> you ask permission for?”</p><p>Her eyes are still closed but she hears Agatha’s laugh and then her hair is loose, falling over her neck and back.</p><p>She nearly purrs when Agatha starts running her fingers through it. It feels especially good when a knot gets caught and Agatha has to tug the slightest bit to get past.</p><p>“I’m not going to be able to sit down,” Rio says when her attention is drawn back to the pulsing fire in her ass.</p><p>“No, you’re not,” Agatha agrees, still playing with her hair.</p><p>“How am I supposed to do anything?”</p><p>“Lay down, stand up, or kneel,” Agatha suggests. “I’m sure you’ll manage.”</p><p>Rio means to never bring it up, ever, ever, ever, because she doesn’t want Agatha to run out the door, but the question bubbles up so effervescently in her chest that she literally can’t contain it and it comes spilling out in a rush. “You didn’t mean to call me baby, did you?”</p>

<p>Agatha freezes with her hand in Rio’s hair. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fu—“No I didn’t,” she admits, her face going clammy. Why did Rio have to notice that? It was a slip-up better left ignored, not reflected upon, and <em>certainly</em> not discussed out loud. “I’m sorry if it freaked you out, I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again. I’m just so used to saying it to—” <em>Stop talking, Agatha. She already expressed she doesn’t want to be viewed as a child, and if you say you’re used to saying it to the kids and that’s why you said it to her, she’s going to be humiliated in the not-fun way and possibly withdraw, which is the last thing you want</em>. “—my cat,” she finishes the sentence. She doesn’t have a fucking cat.</p><p>Rio opens her eyes, and Agatha swears she sees disappointment flicker past. “What’s your cat’s name?”</p><p><em>Great, now you have to make up a whole-ass fake cat</em>. “Joshua.” She says the first name that comes to mind. <em>Joshua?</em> <em>Jesus Christ, Harkness</em>.</p><p>“Your cat is named Joshua?”</p><p>Rio’s tongue is pressed into her cheek, and Agatha can’t tell if it’s just amusement or if it’s Rio not buying her bullshit.</p><p>“I call him Josh for short but Nicky has to be extra and calls him Shua.”</p><p>At the mention of Nicky, Rio turns her face away.</p><p>“What’s that for?” she asks, scratching lightly over Rio’s scalp.</p><p>“You’re a good mom and I’m—” She shrugs and doesn’t finish her sentence.</p><p>“The shittiest guardian on the planet?” Agatha finishes for her. “You’re going to do better, remember?”</p><p>Rio nods but doesn’t turn back to face her. “How do I do better?”</p><p>“By changing one small thing at a time,” Agatha says. “The first thing you’re going to do is keep your drugs hidden in your own bathroom, far away from Vee. Never in the open.”</p><p>That gets Rio facing her with wide eyes. “You’re not going to demand that I stop using altogether?”</p><p>“One small thing at a time,” Agatha says. “Too much at once would end up overwhelming you and causing more setbacks than progress. Keep your drugs away from her at all times, understand?”</p><p>Rio still looks a bit shellshocked, but she nods her understanding and agreement. “Okay. Yeah.”</p><p>“Did you stock the kitchen yet for CYS?”</p><p>“I got a grocery delivery,” Rio says, and her brow furrows. “Was it you that called them?”</p><p>Agatha’s not going to lie about that. “Me and Principal Rooks both called,” she says.</p><p>It stings a little when Rio turns her head away again. “Oh,” she says, flat.</p><p>“I’m not going to apologize for putting Valentina’s needs ahead of anything else,” Agatha says, but she says it as gently as she can.</p><p>“I wasn’t expecting an apology,” Rio says. “I’m realizing that I’m horrible.”</p><p>“Someday I want to hear what made you so horrible,” Agatha says, running her fingers through Rio’s hair again and letting the strands fall freely. “But right now, I just want you to relax and breathe. You were very good for me, Rio, and I want you to feel good about that.”</p><p>Rio hums at the attention to her hair and nods at Agatha’s words. “Okay.” And a second later she adds, “I like hearing you say that.”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip to fight off her more feral urges and keeps it soft. “You like hearing me say you were good?” she says, voice low, mouth hovering a few inches above Rio’s ear.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says with a shiver.</p><p>“You were so good,” Agatha whispers, lightly squeezing a handful of Rio’s hair. “So fucking good, laying over my lap, taking your beating. Weren’t you?”</p><p>Rio moans, turning her face to press into the mattress. “Yes,” she says, muffled by the comforter.</p><p>“And you felt so good on my thighs,” Agatha purrs. “Like you belonged there. Like it was second nature to be draped across my knee…”</p><p>Rio moans again, grabbing handfuls of the comforter. “Please, please,” she begs. “Please touch me, Agatha, I’ve never wanted anyone like this in my life…”</p><p>“I can’t do that, sugar,” Agatha says regretfully, and the regret is absolutely fucking genuine because what she wouldn’t give to bury her fingers or her tongue in Rio’s cunt.</p><p>Rio sounds on the verge of tears. “Ever?” she asks, and it hits Agatha in the chest as well as her pussy.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha says, and it’s honest, because as much as she wants it, if she ever gives in, Rio might stop being interested. And that would devastate her on a level she’s not prepared to admit, in addition to how awful it would probably end up for Valentina.</p><p>“Why?” Rio asks, and it’s so simple a question with such a labyrinth surrounding the answer.</p><p>What can she say to appease Rio and still keep herself protected? “Because if I give you everything, what’s left to want?”</p><p>Rio gasps and pushes up onto her hands and knees so she can stare at Agatha. “You think throwing gasoline on this fire will kill it?” Her eyes are wild. “You’re forgetting something.”</p><p>“What am I forgetting?” Agatha raises her eyebrows, curious despite herself.</p><p>The look on Rio’s face can only be described as sinfully awestruck. “That I’m a fucking <em>addict</em>.”</p><p>By that logic, Agatha’s finding it harder and harder not to give in. “Rio,” she says, drawing a thumb over one pebbled nipple that’s hovering dangerously close to her face. “I can’t.”</p><p>Rio lets out a cry and throws her head back. “Fuck! Fuck, please, <em>please</em>,” she keeps begging, and Agatha’s resistance is starting to chip away.</p><p>“It’s too risky,” she breathes, sitting up, placing a hand between Rio’s shoulder blades to force her back onto her stomach.</p><p>Rio goes without resistance but makes a haunting promise. “I will be addicted to you until the day I die. Maybe even after that.”</p><p><em>Jesus Christ</em>. “I’m not ready to let you feel my tongue or my fingers inside you,” she says. “Do you have any toys?”</p><p>Rio groans. “My closet is full of them.”</p><p>Agatha slides off the bed and goes into the walk-in closet, and she’s met with what she can only label as a sex toy museum. “What the fuck?”</p><p>“I like toys,” Rio says from the bed.</p><p>“So much you didn’t leave any for anyone else, apparently.” They’re even displayed on shelves and racks that look like they came from an actual sex shop.</p><p>“Addict,” Rio calls.</p><p>“Indeed.” She notes they’re arranged by type, then size, and picks a pink vibrator that’s about six inches. She returns to the bed, holding it up, and Rio licks her lips. “Your level of desperation has dropped,” she says, observing Rio’s relaxed body language. “We’ll need to fix that before I even think about touching you with this.”</p><p>“Fix that?” Rio asks.</p><p>“Mm,” Agatha nods. She climbs on the bed on her knees. “Is this clean?”</p><p>“Always.”</p><p>“You clean your sex toys but not your toilet? Because if you tell me your cleaning service cleans your sex toys I’m fucking leaving this house right now.”</p><p>“I clean them!” Rio blurts out, her cheeks flushing pink.</p><p>“How?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“I don’t trust your ability to clean or sanitize. Explain how you clean your sex toys.”</p><p>Rio stares at her in disbelief, stuttering over herself, and it takes a minute for her to be able to get out actual words. “I use cleaner from the boutique I buy the toys from,” she says.</p><p>“Do you actually research what cleaners are best or do you just point and click?”</p><p>Rio squirms a little. “I shop in person, actually, and the clerks show me which cleaners to get.”</p><p>Agatha pulls one of Rio’s arms out from under her and presses the vibrator into her hand. “Show me how you clean it. What motions you use. Do you scrub it or just dunk it in cleaner? What do you use, a rag, paper towels, or a scrub brush? Or just your hands?”</p><p>Rio continues to stare in disbelief as she answers. “I—I scrub them with a brush,” she says.</p><p>“Get up on your knees so you can use both hands, and show me. Pretend you’re holding the brush.”</p><p>Rio looks like there’s nothing she wants to do less, but she gets on her knees and pretends to scrub the vibrator.</p><p>Agatha’s satisfied and grabs it back, but can’t resist saying “you missed a spot.”</p><p>Rio’s just gaping at her.</p><p>“Get back down.”</p><p>Rio settles on her stomach and Agatha takes a moment to appreciate the swirling curving red lines and purple bruises on her tempting ass. She can’t go near that now but she will at some point, she’s certain.</p><p>“Now, what to do with you? Praise you? Or humiliate you? I wonder which would make you wetter.”</p><p>Rio’s disbelief slowly morphs into more of an awestruck gaze.</p><p>“Which is more powerful, sugar? Praise or humiliation?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen and her tongue slides out to wet her lips. “I don’t know,” she breathes. “No one’s ever done either except for you.”</p><p>Maybe she’ll mix it up, then. “No? No one’s ever told you what a good girl you are for being such a little whore?”</p><p>She brings the vibrator up to her mouth and extends her tongue for a slow, teasing lick around the tip.</p><p>Rio’s jaw drops, and Agatha can see her breathing pick up in the way her back rises and falls, muscles rippling under her shoulder blades.</p><p>“You’re so pretty, Rio,” she purrs, running her free hand through Rio’s hair and tracing patterns down the back of her neck with one fingernail. “It’s too bad your beauty is wasted on someone so… fucking… hopeless.”</p><p>Rio moans, eyelids fluttering.</p><p>“You’re such a train wreck, aren’t you, sugar? One look from me and you’re on your stomach, gagging on my tie while you fuck yourself because no one else can stand to touch you…” She sucks the head of the vibrator into her mouth and lets it out with a pop.</p><p>Rio’s whining now, gripping the comforter, squirming constantly.</p><p>Agatha turns on the motor and runs it down Rio’s spine, enjoying the way she jerks in surprise and holds her breath.</p><p>“Are you going to be good for me, Rio?” she asks in her best condescending stripper voice.</p><p>Rio nods tersely.</p><p>“I don’t believe you.”</p><p>Panic starts to set in to those wide brown eyes and Agatha soaks it up like a dehydrated sapling.</p><p>“I’ll be good,” Rio says.</p><p>“I still don’t believe you,” Agatha tuts. “Maybe I should just leave.”</p><p>Rio starts shaking and her eyes fill with tears. “Please,” she whispers. “I’ll be good, Agatha, I’ll be good for you, I swear I will…”</p><p>It shouldn’t light Agatha’s nerves on fire, but it does. The begging really does. “There’s just one problem, sugar. If I use this from behind, my arm’s going to bump into your ass with every thrust, and we can’t have that. And you certainly can’t lay on your back, so what do we do, hmm?”</p><p>“I’ll do anything you say,” Rio promises. “Anything, just touch me, please.”</p><p>She’s desperate enough now, and Agatha slides backward off the bed. “We’ll have to try it standing, won’t we?”</p><p>Rio is off the bed in an instant, wobbling on shaky legs, but with no obvious thought in her head of protesting.</p><p>Agatha goes to the middle of the room. “Come here.”</p><p>Rio shuffles over, slowly, and it’s clear that walking hurts her abused backside, but she doesn’t complain.</p><p>When she’s close enough, Agatha reaches her free hand up into that dark messy hair and grips a handful at the base of her neck to guide Rio’s head to her chest, so they’re standing front pressed to front, and drops the hand with the vibrator, which is still on its lowest setting, threatening to make her hand numb if she doesn’t give the vibrations somewhere else to focus their pulsing.</p><p>She runs the vibrator up the inside of Rio’s thighs to get her to open up, and Rio shifts her stance to make room.</p><p>“Where can I put my hands?” Rio whispers against her chest.</p><p>“Mmm, good girl,” Agatha nearly moans at the question. “Just for that, you can put them on my waist.”</p><p>Hands immediately find her waist, resting there without pressure.</p><p>“Well?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“What?” Rio breathes.</p><p>“What do you say when someone does you a favor?”</p><p>Rio mewls and presses her face harder into Agatha’s chest, hips pressing forward. “Thank you,” she says, voice muffled.</p><p>“You’re welcome,” Agatha says with a patronizing chuckle. “So obedient when you want to get fucked, aren’t you, Rio?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says. She’s still shaking, Agatha can feel it everywhere they’re touching. It has to be hard for her to stand up, but she’s clearly willing to endure it just to be touched with a piece of vibrating plastic that’s not held in her own hand.</p><p>“I don’t know if you’re wet enough to take this,” she hums, tapping the toy against Rio’s leg.</p><p>“I am,” Rio whimpers. “Please, I’m wet enough.”</p><p>“Nah, I’d better get it nice and slippery first. Wouldn’t want to hurt you,” Agatha says with a snicker. “Undo my belt, sugar.”</p><p>Rio’s knees buckle and Agatha has to shoot an arm around her to hold her up.</p><p>“Calm down,” she scolds. “I asked you to undo my belt, not cryogenically freeze yourself.”</p><p>Rio whimpers again and finds her footing so Agatha can unwrap her arm, and trembling hands fumble with her belt buckle, taking twice as long as it should to get it undone.</p><p>“Button and zipper, then put your hands back on my waist,” Agatha orders.</p><p>Rio lowers the zipper but she can’t get the button, she’s too tremulous. “It won’t,” she cries out.</p><p>“Then just pull it,” Agatha says, giving her permission to break it. She’s not that fond of these pants anyway.</p><p>Rio pulls, and the button flies off, and then hands are back on her waist, squeezing a little tighter than before, but she allows it because she knows Rio needs help standing.</p><p>“Good girl, Rio,” she says, letting that tiny note of affection into her voice just for a moment, and the responding little moan is delicious.</p><p>Agatha shoves the vibrator down the front of her pants, under the band of her underwear, and eases it inside herself with zero difficulty. She’s fucking soaked.</p><p>When Rio realizes what she’s doing, she goes insane. “Oh my god, oh my fucking god, what are you doing?” Rio pants, clutching her waist even tighter, to the point of pain. “What the fuck are you doing? What are you doing? You’re—you’re gonna—that—that—that—”</p><p>“Shut up,” Agatha says smoothly, and Rio abruptly stops talking.</p><p>She slides the vibrator out of herself and puts it between Rio’s legs, rubbing the tip back and forth through her folds, and when she can feel it line up properly she gives one smooth thrust and seats it all the way inside.</p><p>Rio screams against her chest, nails digging into her waist, and oh, Agatha is definitely just as addicted to this hot mess as Rio is to her.</p><p>“You’re gagging for it and I’m not even touching you,” Agatha breathes in the girl’s ear. “It’s just a piece of plastic. Not even my fingers. No skin to skin contact at all, and you’re going fucking crazy, aren’t you?”</p><p>Rio moans and whines and grinds down on the toy. “Yes,” she wheezes.</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha agrees, and she has a feeling that if she wasn’t holding Rio’s head to her chest, she’d be getting bitten somewhere, and Rio wouldn’t even be able to help it. That’s part of the reason she chose this position – so she wouldn’t risk Rio’s mouth roaming free while she’s distracted and end up with teeth in her neck or shoulder. The other reason is because standing in the middle of the room, holding the girl against her is soft and sweet and an exact counterpoint to the words she utters and the frantic pace she’s keeping between Rio’s legs. “Say it, Rio.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t hesitate. “I’m gagging for it and you’re not even touching me,” she gasps out, her hips continuing to seek stimulation even as Agatha’s thrusting pretty goddamn hard.</p><p>“Such a good little bitch,” Agatha praises the quick compliance, and Rio clenches on the toy, shuddering in her arms, clawing the ever-loving fuck out of her waist.</p><p>But she manages to stay standing, even if she seems about to fully collapse.</p><p>“If I ever put my hands or mouth on you,” Agatha threatens as Rio’s still coming down from her peak, “you will not come until I give you permission, do you hear me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes are dazed when Agatha pulls her head back to look at her. Glassy. Gone.</p><p>She slides the vibrator out and tosses it on the bed, then guides Rio over with the hand in her hair. “Up,” she says. “Before you collapse.”</p><p>Rio crawls onto the bed and her arms give out, and Agatha catches her by the shoulders to ease her down.</p><p>“There you go,” she croons. “So pretty, aren’t you?” She brushes the sweaty hair back from Rio’s forehead and stretches out beside her, propped up on an elbow like earlier. “Such a pretty girl. Such a good girl for me, sugar,” she says, drawing her thumb down the side of Rio’s face, helping ground her and bring her back from the headspace she’s descended into.</p><p>Agatha’s not sure how she’s meant to work after this, but that’s her own fault. A quick glance at Rio’s nightstand clock tells her she has about forty-five minutes before she needs to leave.</p><p>Rio rolls on her side facing Agatha, a grimace on her lips as she moves, and reaches out.</p><p>Agatha’s heart starts thudding against her bones, creating a cacophonous disaster in her ears. She had not anticipated this. What is she supposed to do? That’s not what this is supposed to be. But on the other hand, she quite literally blistered Rio’s ass, so she has a responsibility to provide aftercare no matter what their relationship is meant to be.</p><p>She lays on her back and lets Rio snuggle up against her side, and puts an arm under her neck, bending at the elbow to hold her a little. She knows the girl has to be in a tremendous amount of pain, but not once does Rio complain or protest. She just lays there, silent, picking at the collar of Agatha’s blouse with one hand.</p><p>After about fifteen minutes, Agatha can’t take the silence. “What are you thinking?” she asks softly.</p><p>Rio blinks and looks up at her for a second before laying her head back down. She still hasn’t stopped picking at Agatha’s collar. “I’m thinking about how my life is suddenly on hold.”</p><p>Agatha tries not to stiffen at that, but has no idea whether she succeeds, and Rio gives no indication she’s noticed anything. “What do you mean?”</p><p>“I can’t go on like I was,” Rio says, picking a little harder at the collar. “And I can’t have you move in. So I’m stuck in limbo. Every decision I make is going to depend on whether you’re giving me the time of day.”</p><p>Agatha should be thrilled to hear that, because isn’t that what she wanted? A way to control Rio to make things better for Valentina?</p><p>So why does it feel wrong? She needs to think very carefully about how to respond before she opens her mouth. Half of her wants to dismiss the concern and just move forward anyway. The other half tries to choke her out for thinking that. Somehow this absolute fucking shit show of a woman has managed to make her feel guilty. “Rio, I…” But she doesn’t know what to say.</p><p>“You asked what I was thinking,” Rio snaps.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha says placatingly. “I know. I didn’t expect you to be… to be…”</p><p>“To be human?” Rio asks bitterly. “Yeah, neither did I.”</p>

<p>Agatha looks… conflicted. “My priority—”</p><p>“Is Valentina,” Rio interrupts. “I know that. If you never said it again I’d know it for the rest of my life.”</p><p>“But Rio, that doesn’t mean—”</p><p>“Doesn’t mean what?” Rio interrupts again, pushing Agatha away. “Doesn’t mean I can’t have a few scraps of attention every now and then? Doesn’t mean you can’t slice me open and turn me inside out and dangle real life just beyond my reach? Doesn’t mean what, Agatha?” She’s shouting now.</p><p>The stricken look on Agatha’s face should <em>mean</em> something, but right this second it doesn’t. Rio feels fucking broken, in a way she’s not used to, and being sober, having to feel every emotion makes it a hundred thousand times worse.</p><p>“I need you to leave.”</p><p>“Rio—”</p><p>“I’m serious, I need you to leave. Where is my robe?”</p><p>Agatha climbs off the bed, and the robe was apparently under her, and Rio grabs it, standing up and pulling it on, doing her best to keep the throbbing pain from showing on her face. She doesn’t need Agatha having any more ammunition.</p><p>“Would you just—”</p><p>“Get. Out.” Her hands are clenched into fists at her sides, her teeth gritted, and when she realizes she’s still wearing Agatha’s tie, she rips it from around her neck and throws it at Agatha’s face. “Take your fucking training collar with you.”</p><p>Agatha looks like she’s about to cry, but Rio doesn’t care. She ties her robe and goes into the bathroom, locking herself in.</p><p>“Be gone by the time I come out!” she screams.</p><p>She needs her phone. She needs Jed. She needs to not feel the amalgamation of shit she’s feeling right now. She’s not made for it. Can’t handle it. She’s going to break apart at the seams. Her head is splitting and her ass is burning and throbbing like the fires of hell. It hurts every time she fucking moves.</p><p>She stays in the bathroom watching out the window until she sees Agatha drive away, then goes downstairs to get her phone out of her purse and sends Jed an SOS text.</p><p>Whenever she SOSes, he makes her his next stop no matter what, and she pays him five grand extra.</p><p>--</p><p>“Girl why the fuck you need more shit already?” Jed says when she opens the door.</p><p>“I don’t pay you to ask questions,” she snaps.</p><p>“All right all right, calm down, shit,” he says, skulking into the house and getting out his baggies and scale. “How much you want?”</p><p>“How much are you holding?”</p><p>“No way, RiRi. You think I wanna fish my best-paying customer outta the river?”</p><p>Rio growls at him and starts pacing. “Just give me as much as you’ll give me, then.”</p><p>“Right now I’m bouta give you one eight-ball and that’s it,” he says. “You gonna sit down?”</p><p>“I can’t,” she bites out before she can censor herself, and makes up a quick excuse. “I’m too on edge to sit. Just give me an ounce.”</p><p>He sighs and weighs it out, and is about to dump it on the coffee table when she stops him.</p><p>“Wait!”</p><p>He looks up at her with his hand on the scale and blinks.</p><p>“Put it in a baggie. I can’t leave it on the coffee table anymore.”</p><p>“Why not? Cops on your ass?” He gets out a baggie and scrapes her ounce into it, then drags his fingers across the top to seal it.</p><p>“Something like that,” she says, chewing her bottom lip. She pays him for the ounce, plus his extra five grand for express delivery, and snatches the baggie out of his hand.</p><p>“Ain’t never seen you like this, RiRi,” he says, shaking his head. “Got som’ to do with that lady was here yesterday?”</p><p>“You mean the one you pulled a fucking gun on? Yeah, it does. Can you go? I want to be alone.”</p><p>He mock salutes as he always does and leaves without another word. Thank God for drug dealers that give too many fucks about their money to risk crossing her.</p><p>She plucks a crisp, clean hundred dollar bill from her purse and heads upstairs. Into her bathroom. Opens the baggie with shaking hands and some of the coke spills out onto the floor.</p><p>Words she’d snapped at Agatha flash through her mind. <em>Pour some coke on the floor, I can clean that up in five seconds</em>.</p><p>She rolls up the hundred, gets on her knees, leans down, and breathes in everything that spilled. Every last crystal. She doesn’t know how much it is… maybe two lines’ worth. She’s gonna need more than that today.</p><p>So she tips more out of the baggie onto the floor, because might as well, and savors the burn as it shoots up her nose.</p><p>She’s relaxed at first. Then jittery. She can’t hold still. Maybe it was too much? Is that even a thing for her, too much oblivion? More likely not enough.</p><p>The next thing she knows she’s gasping awake, struggling for breath, and when she starts thrashing she’s held down, an oxygen mask slipped over her face. She’s moving, but… no idea where she is or what’s going on. Everything’s blurry. Watery. Far away. Her head hurts and her heart is racing. Thump, thump, thump. Relentless. Her chest hurts so bad. And she’s hot. She’s so hot it’s like the inside of her skin is on fire.</p><p>A siren starts blaring.</p><p>Oh. She’s in an ambulance.</p><p>Well, fuck.</p><p>“We need to bring her heart rate down. Push benzos.”</p><p>“Pushing two of lorazepam.”</p><p>Something cold is slid under her neck. Yes. More of that, please.</p><p>Her heart starts to settle, but it’s short-lived relief, and soon it’s racing again.</p><p>“Pushing three of lorazepam.”</p><p>“Blood pressure’s not responding. Push phentolamine.”</p><p>“Pushing one of phentolamine.”</p><p>She stops trying to listen to what they’re saying and just breathes. The world slowly, very slowly, starts coming back into focus. She’s cooling down, the chest pain is lessening, her heart isn’t pounding so hard anymore.</p><p>“Howdigethere?” she asks, and blinks at the slowness and thickness of her voice.</p><p>“Don’t try to talk, ma’am, just focus on breathing.”</p><p>Sounds good to Rio. She lets her eyes close and welcomes the looming comfort of sleep.</p><p>--</p><p>When she wakes up, she’s in a hospital bed, attached to a million monitors, the steady beeping actually kind of nice to wake up to. Calm. Measured. Everything her life usually isn’t.</p><p>At least she’s breathing without an oxygen mask.</p><p>There’s a nurse changing out her IV fluid bag so she asks a question.</p><p>“How long have I been here?” Ugh, her voice sounds broken.</p><p>The woman jumps and turns with a friendly smile. “Sorry, I didn’t know you were awake. You’ve been here for a few hours. Can I get you some ice chips?”</p><p>Yeah, her mouth is bone fucking dry. “Yeah,” she says weakly.</p><p>“Sure, I’ll be right back.”</p><p>The nurse disappears and comes back with a small cup of ice chips, setting it on her tray.</p><p>“Take it slow, your body’s just been through a trauma.”</p><p>Rio nods and takes one of the ice chips, and the way it coats her throat with relief when she swallows… She wants to down the whole cup but she contains herself to one more, then sets the cup back on the tray. “How did I even get here?”</p><p>“Someone called 911 and directed the EMTs into your house,” the nurse tells her. “I can check your chart to see if the person is identified.”</p><p>“No, that’s okay.” It will have been her cleaning service. Probably not going to be her cleaning service anymore, she thinks with a grimace.</p><p>The idea of having to find a new cleaning service that she trusts both to get the job done and not steal anything is too overwhelming so she puts it out of her mind for the moment.</p><p>“When can I leave?”</p><p>The nurse raises her eyebrows. “You still need a chest X-ray and some ECGs. The lab is running your markers now.”</p><p>“Markers?”</p><p>“They’re testing to see if your heart sustained any injury from your overdose.”</p><p>Rio does not like hearing the word overdose. She narrows her eyes. “I’m sure it’s fine.”</p><p>“I’ll just let the doctor discuss that with you when she’s available.”</p><p>“Yeah. You do that.”</p><p>A few minutes later, registration comes in and asks her a bunch of questions about her health history and insurance, and when she says she has no emergency contact, the man blinks.</p><p>“No one we can call?”</p><p>“No one’s going to visit me, don’t waste your breath,” she mutters.</p><p>“I—I’m sorry,” he stutters, moves on to the rest of his questions, and leaves.</p><p>Rio sighs, frustrated. This is not how she wanted her day to go. She jabs the button for the nurse repeatedly until the woman returns.</p><p>“What can I do for you?”</p><p>“I want to go home.”</p><p>“We really advise against it,” the nurse says, and Rio can tell she’s having to make an effort to be nice about it.</p><p>“I don’t care. I’m leaving.”</p><p>She’s about to rip out her IV when the doctor comes into the room, holding a clipboard as she jots something down. “Ms. Vidal? I’m Dr. Hammond. I hear you want to leave us?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says. “I’m going home.”</p><p>“I’m afraid I’ll have to insist that you stay at least until we can get a chest X-ray, otherwise I’ll be forced to initiate paperwork to attempt to keep you for observation as a danger to yourself.”</p><p>Rio’s blood starts to boil, her splitting headache returning, and she shouts at the doctor. “Fuck you!”</p><p>“I understand it’s not ideal, but we need to get that X-ray before we can clear you to leave.”</p><p>“Well how fucking long is that going to take?” Rio’s spitting fire.</p><p>“I believe there’s only one more patient ahead of you, so it shouldn’t be too much longer.”</p><p>“I’ll CashApp you ten thousand dollars to make me next.”</p><p>If the doctor is surprised by that, her face doesn’t show it. “I’m not in control of who goes when,” she says simply. “I take it we’ve reached an agreement? You won’t try to leave until you’re cleared to do so?”</p><p>“Go fuck yourself,” Rio sneers, turning her face away.</p><p>The doctor and the nurse both leave after that, and Rio just sits there seething. What a stupid fucking rule. It’s her life, she should be able to go home if she fucking feels like it.</p><p>After sulking for a while, she figures watching TV is better than doing nothing, and she’s about to turn it on when she hears a voice out at the nurses’ station that makes her breath catch.</p><p>“I’m not asking you <em>if</em> she’s here, her niece already told me she was brought in by ambulance. I’m just asking what room she’s in.”</p><p>“And I’m telling you I can’t give out that information except to a relative.”</p><p>“Well I wasn’t bringing her seventeen-year-old niece as collateral!”</p><p>Rio’s heart starts racing, and evidently the monitors are programmed to watch for that, because alarms start going off all over the place and her nurse rushes in. “Ms. Vidal?”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio snaps.</p><p>Apparently Agatha hears either her voice or the nurse say her name, because a second later she’s in the doorway, and Rio doesn’t want to look at her but she can’t look away.</p><p>Agatha’s so beautiful… and she looks so wrecked right now. Her hair is a wilder mess than usual and her gorgeous blue eyes are dulled and haunted. Rio wants to tell her to leave, but she can’t. She’s too overwhelmed that Agatha’s actually there. Actually came to the hospital. It doesn’t fit their conversation that morning. It doesn’t fit anything.</p><p>The nurse resets the monitors with some combination of buttons, and it’s too fast for Rio to memorize or she would so she can turn them off herself. Because with Agatha in her hospital room, her heart is bound to keep racing, and those alarms are gonna keep going off.</p><p>When Agatha steps fully into the room, Rio’s heart kicks up again and like she suspected, the alarms start blaring.</p><p>The nurse was halfway to the door and turns around, staring.</p><p>“Turn that fucking shit off!” Rio demands.</p><p>The nurse looks at Agatha, standing there unimpressed with her arms folded over her chest, then looks back to Rio, and there’s some amusement there that Rio wants to knock right off her face.</p><p>“I’ll raise the threshold but I can’t turn it off,” she says, punching more buttons and quieting the aggressive sounds.</p><p>“If it goes off again for no reason I swear to god,” Rio threatens, letting her words hang in the air as the nurse leaves the room.</p><p>Agatha steps closer, one eyebrow raised. “It didn’t go off for nothing,” she says. “It went off because your heart started racing when you saw me.”</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Rio asks, and she’s trying to sound angry, trying to pull emotions from this morning, but she can’t. She’s not angry, she’s just confused. And a little… affected by the fact that Agatha came to see her.</p><p>“Your cleaning service told Valentina what happened, and Vee texted me. What were you thinking, Rio?”</p><p>Rio flinches as Agatha’s hand comes toward her, not sure what to expect, but it’s shaking as fingers run lightly over her cheek.</p><p>“Why are you shaking?”</p><p>Agatha sits on the edge of the bed and leans over, and when lips press to her forehead, Rio has never felt so small and vulnerable in her life.</p><p>“You could’ve died,” Agatha whispers against her skin.</p><p>Rio’s heart is racing again, but the alarms don’t blare to life. “So what?” she whispers back.</p><p>“I’ve only just started getting to know you.” Still a whisper.</p><p>“You don’t want to know me,” Rio says, her eyes stinging.</p><p>“That’s not true,” Agatha says, resting their foreheads together. “The fact that I kicked all of this off for Valentina’s safety and well-being doesn’t mean something else hasn’t started to develop. You didn’t let me talk this morning. I wasn’t trying to brush you off. I was trying to gather my thoughts and understand what I was feeling.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t want to believe her. “What were you feeling, then?” It comes out bitter and Agatha separates from her to look down at her, and the intensity in the gaze makes her sweat.</p><p>“I still don’t know,” Agatha says. “I haven’t had time to figure it out. I’d barely been at work an hour when Vee texted and I came straight here.”</p><p>“You left work?” Rio’s breath comes out in a rush. “For me? That’s a stupid thing to do…”</p><p>“What can I say?” Agatha bites her lip with a coy little shrug. “Women are my weakness.”</p><p>Rio frowns. “I’m serious.”</p><p>Agatha touches her face again, palm flat against her cheek. “So am I.”</p><p>Rio tries not to lean into the touch. Tries not to give in. “So what do we do, then?”</p><p>Agatha leans over again and murmurs directly against the shell of her ear. “I don’t know everything… but what I do know… is that the <em>spanking</em> I gave you earlier is going to feel like a massage compared to what I’ll do to you for <em>this</em> little stunt.”</p><p>Rio gasps, eyes slamming shut, and the alarms go off like rockets.</p><p>Agatha backs off as the nurse rushes in.</p><p>“All right, that’s enough,” the nurse says as she quiets the machines. “You’ll have to leave for now, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rio just lays there, breathing hard and doing nothing else. And thanks to Agatha’s reminder, now she’s very aware of the fact that her ass is touching the bed and hurts like hell. She had forgotten in the midst of all the chaos, but the mention of it brings her focus to it and god, it hurts.</p><p>“I’ll be in the waiting room,” Agatha says sheepishly and takes her leave.</p><p>Rio’s face is hot and she refuses to look at the nurse. Or speak.</p><p>Luckily, before her face gets so hot it goes supernova, the X-ray tech comes to collect her, and wheels her out of the room.</p>

<p>Agatha sits in the waiting room in a horribly uncomfortable chair, adjusting her position every five minutes to avoid tweaking her back or something.</p><p>The way her heart leapt into her throat when Vee texted her Rio had overdosed… So she’s grateful to have seen with her own eyes that Rio would be okay. Well, alive, at least, and not with brain damage. Who’s to say there won’t be lasting effects of another nature? Time will tell on that. What the fuck did Rio think she was doing?</p><p>The anger at Rio fades into a guilty conscience, because she knows in her heart that Rio took too much trying to escape the feelings Agatha caused her. And that doesn’t make it her <em>fault</em>, but it makes it <em>because</em> of her, and that twists her up inside and makes anxiety swim too close to the vagus nerve for comfort. She feels it tripping, wanting to let up the contents of her breakfast, and she needs to distract herself somehow before she actually does vomit.</p><p>She stands and starts pacing, and finally decides to hell with the nurse, she’s going back in there. Except the double doors to the patient rooms are locked from this side.</p><p>When someone comes through the doors, Agatha approaches with a pleading look. “Can I go back to see my girlfriend yet? She’s all alone back there and no one will tell me anything,” she lies. Sort of.</p><p>“What’s her name?”</p><p>“Rio Vidal, she’s in room fifteen I think, is what she texted me…”</p><p>The woman goes around a podium to look it up on the computer and buzzes the doors for Agatha. “Go ahead. She’s in X-ray right now but you can wait in her room.”</p><p>“Thank you so much,” Agatha says and rushes through the doors, trying to avoid Rio’s nurse on her way to the room.</p><p>No such luck. She almost collides with the woman. “I thought I told you to skedaddle,” the nurse says.</p><p>Agatha stares at her in a bit of disbelief at her choice of words, but quickly shakes herself out of it. “Please?” she says, biting her lip. “I won’t rile her up, I promise. I’ll just sit by the window and read a book on my phone or something. Please?”</p><p>The nurse sighs and rolls her eyes, but waves Agatha on. “Don’t make me regret it.”</p><p>Agatha tries not to look too gleeful as she continues on her way to Rio’s room. She does pull the only chair present over to the window and sits, but she doesn’t read a book on her phone. She just waits.</p><p>It’s not too much longer before Rio gets wheeled back into the room, and Agatha gives a stupid little wave before grunting at herself and hiding her face in her hands.</p><p>“I thought you were kicked out,” Rio says when she’s all set up and the X-ray tech leaves.</p><p>“I was, but I started feeling sick about everything, so I begged my way back in.” Might as well be honest at this point. It couldn’t be worse than trying to come up with a lie. <em>Like Joshua the cat</em>, her brain screams at her.</p><p>“Sick?” Rio asks, and Agatha uncovers her face to look at the other woman, whose expression reads as confused as her tone of voice.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat and nods, trying to sound casual. “Yeah. You know… like… guilty.”</p><p>“Guilty?” Rio asks, and Agatha wonders if they’re fated to sit here with Rio repeating everything she says as a one-word question.</p><p>“You were so upset with me this morning, and then… this.” She waves her hand to encompass the hospital room and all the equipment attached to Rio’s body. “You were trying to get away from how I made you feel. Weren’t you?”</p><p>Rio looks at her intently, and she can’t read the expression anymore. But she looks away when she answers. “Yeah.”</p><p>Agatha can’t fault her for telling the truth, even if it hurts. “I didn’t mean to hurt you,” she says softly, her chest aching. “I really still don’t know what I feel. I wasn’t brushing you off, I swear to god.”</p><p>“I didn’t expect any visitors.” Rio changes the subject.</p><p>Agatha’s grateful. “Because you push people away before they get within five hundred yards.”</p><p>“It’s always served me well. And I think you mean five hundred miles.”</p><p>“You like being alone?”</p><p>“It’s not a matter of like or don’t like. I’ve been alone forever. It just <em>is</em>. You’re the first person I’ve ever been captivated by.”</p><p>“Me, or my tie?” Agatha asks, and it’s meant to be funny but it comes out more serious than not.</p><p>“You really can’t guess why the tie is so important to me?”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skips because Rio said ‘is’ and not ‘was’. “I only have a vague idea,” she admits.</p><p>She doesn’t think Rio is actually going to tell her, but she drags her chair over by the bed just in case and sits, ready to listen.</p><p>Rio just looks at her for a few minutes, then sighs and runs a hand through her hair. “The tie—it’s—so that first night, when I thought you were a stripper, and you made me take you to a bedroom instead of the party, and you didn’t fall all over yourself to make me happy—you did the opposite, actually, and—that was the first time in my life I’ve ever felt a spark of interest in another person.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t dare move or breathe, not wanting to do anything to make Rio stop talking, and by the end of the explanation, she’s staring in wonder. “Ever? As in literally ever?”</p><p>“Literally ever,” Rio says. “I have been bored senseless for decades. But my dead black heart started beating when you pushed me down on the bed and called me pathetic.”</p><p>“Dead black heart?” Agatha asks, choking on the words, her eyes burning as she tries not to let Rio’s confession make her cry. “That’s not—”</p><p>“True?” Rio interrupts her. “It is true, Agatha. It’s black. And it beats for you.” She sighs again. “I know I was angry and lashed out this morning, but the truth is, I <em>will</em> take whatever scraps of attention I can get from you. Because I’ve never wanted anyone else and I never will. No one stirs me. No one holds my focus for longer than thirty seconds, and even then it’s only when I can get something from them. But you, you give me <em>nothing</em> and make me feel like you’ve given me more than I deserve. I don’t know how you do that but I crave you so fucking badly it hurts.”</p><p>“I never meant to make you feel like that,” Agatha whispers. “I thought—”</p><p>“I know what you thought,” Rio interrupts again.</p><p>“Stop interrupting me,” Agatha says, the tiniest hint of frustration starting to surface that Rio won’t let her talk. Just like this morning.</p><p>Rio looks combative for a second but deflates and bites her lip. “Sorry,” she says around it.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha says, and nods to herself to continue. “I thought that I could tell you off that night and you might feel bad for the way you’d been treating Valentina. That was my original plan, but when you didn’t get angry, and you just… your mouth dropped open a little and you shifted around on the bed, and I realized it turned you on to be called pathetic, my plan derailed so fast there was no hope of salvaging it. So I… adapted. And you’re so pretty and I’m only human and so weak for wanting you, but I did, I wanted you to crumble underneath me, and I was so fucking wet that I could say all those awful things to you and have you <em>like</em> it… I hated you for the things Valentina told me, but I couldn’t resist trying to make you mine anyway. My selfless mission became so fucking selfish, Rio, because I <em>wanted</em> to make you addicted to me. I got off on it so hard. I was lying to myself because I didn’t want to believe I could be that selfish, but I had to have you. And once I had you under my control, then I could force you to change the way you treated Valentina. But that was never the plan to begin with. I only meant to barge into your house one time, rip you a new asshole, make things better for Vee, and leave. But I couldn’t. I just couldn’t.” She shrugs, tears streaming down her face even as she tries to wipe them away. Admitting these things about herself is agonizing, but she owes Rio the unfettered truth.</p><p>Rio’s expression is unreadable. Agatha has no idea whether her words have even registered because Rio is completely blank. Staring right through her almost.</p><p>But then a shaky hand reaches out and lays on top of her fidgeting ones, and Agatha knows Rio heard her. “I need time to process that,” she whispers. “Th—thank you for telling me. I just need—need to think…”</p><p>“You’re really warm,” Agatha says, just as the alarms start going off. She backs out of the way when the nurse comes in. “It wasn’t me this time, she’s clammy, she—”</p><p>“We’re going to try a cocktail this time since your body temperature and heart rate keep coming back up,” the nurse says, and Agatha notices the syringe in her hand. She watches the nurse feed it into Rio’s IV.</p><p>“What is that?” Rio asks, trying to pull out her IV, but Agatha jumps forward and grabs her hand before she can.</p><p>“It’s called a B-52, honey,” the nurse says. “It’s a combination of things to help you relax and keep your heart rate down.”</p><p>Agatha’s going to Google that as soon as it’s safe to let go of Rio’s hand. She’s scared, honestly, because why would Rio suddenly try to rip out the IV? She has no idea what’s going on, only that it’s terrifying.</p><p>Rio fights Agatha’s hold, but she’s too weak to do much besides try to pull her hand away, and Agatha starts rubbing her thumb back and forth hoping to calm her. Rio starts to relax when she does that, and Agatha stands still and quiet, just rubbing Rio’s hand for about five more minutes before her breathing evens into sleep.</p><p>Agatha carefully sets her hand down and looks across the bed at the nurse. “What’s wrong with her?” she asks quietly.</p><p>“Agitation is one of the main psychiatric issues with a cocaine overdose,” the nurse explains. “We’re keeping a close eye on her and doing our best to keep her heart rate down and lower her body temperature. If you want to keep applying cool cloths to her face and neck, that’s something you can do to help. I can get a cloth if you’d like to do that?”</p><p>Agatha nods, feeling pretty helpless and grateful to have something to do.</p><p>The nurse gets a cloth from the cabinet above the sink and wets it, then hands it over to Agatha.</p><p>Agatha stands by the bed and holds the cloth to Rio’s cheek. “How long should I hold it before moving it?”</p><p>“It doesn’t matter, honey,” the nurse says kindly. “Anything will help.”</p><p>Agatha swallows back emotion and just nods.</p><p>“I’ll be right outside at the nurses’ station if you need anything. I turned the threshold back down on the monitors so if her heart rate goes up, we’ll hear it. Okay?”</p><p>Agatha nods again. “Thank you,” she tries to say, but her voice is so choked it doesn’t come out very intelligibly.</p><p>“Of course,” the nurse says, and takes her leave.</p><p>The guilt is coiling in Agatha’s belly like a snake, fangs ready to rip her organs apart from the inside. Rio looks so fragile like this – her face relaxed in sleep, rumpled hospital gown instead of her expensive dresses, hooked up to heart monitors and pulse ox and an IV in one hand… And it’s because of <em>her</em>. She didn’t cause the drug habit but she started this dance of death with Rio before thinking through all possible consequences, or <em>any</em> possible consequences, because she couldn’t stop herself. And that’s a terrible feeling. She played with Rio’s emotions because she didn’t think Rio had any to play with, but that was naïve and short sighted of her. Everyone has emotions, even Rio, even if they’re buried so deep they’re impossible to detect without ground-penetrating radar. She should’ve known better. Shouldn’t have let things go so far. She’s the one with an uncompromised mind. She should’ve been the voice of reason. And now… what if Rio’s not okay?</p><p>The rag doesn’t feel cold enough anymore so she goes around to the sink and gets it wet again, wrings it out just enough that it won’t be dripping everywhere but not enough to make it too dry, and presses it to Rio’s other cheek.</p><p>Guilt is one of the hardest emotions to combat, and it eats her alive as she listens to the steady beeping of Rio’s monitors.</p><p>She distracts herself by getting out her phone and Googling B-52 with one hand, and apart from a bunch of bomber planes it doesn’t look promising. She tries B-52s but that only brings up the band. She tries B-52 cocktail and it comes up with a shot of Kahlua, Bailey’s and triple sec. She’s starting to think the nurse either lied or misspoke, and gives it one last shot by searching for B-52 hospital, and her pulse calms when she sees that it does exist. It’s Benadryl, haloperidol, and lorazepam, and Google says it’s used to calm violent or agitated patients in a hospital setting.</p><p>She reads further and it says that hospitals are moving more toward a different cocktail called a Fiver, and when the nurse comes back in she’s going to ask why they didn’t give Rio that instead.</p><p>She spends the next hour watching inane Youtube videos to keep from thinking too hard while she re-wets the cloth every five minutes or so to keep it at its coolest.</p><p>She puts her phone in her pocket when Rio starts to stir and places her hand over the IV in case Rio’s still of a mind to rip it out.</p><p>Rio’s eyes land on her face, her expression once again unreadable. “You’re still here,” she says softly, and while her expression might be unreadable, her voice is not. She’s awed that Agatha stayed.</p><p>“Where else would I be?” Agatha asks, trying to be funny, but it’s not her best work. “I mean… of course I’m still here.”</p><p>Rio reaches up to take the cloth off of her neck. “What’s this?”</p><p>“To keep you cool.”</p><p>She puts it back where it was with a nod. “Oh.” She looks at Agatha, eyes pleading. “I want to go home.”</p><p>Agatha knows how it feels to just want the comfort of home. “I know,” she says gently, “but you can’t yet. You still need IV fluids and medications.”</p><p>“I don’t like it here,” Rio says, and Agatha barely hears her it’s so quiet.</p><p>“Did they do something to you before I got here?”</p><p>“No,” Rio admits. “I just don’t like hospitals.”</p><p>“They’re not my favorite either, but I’ll stay as long as you want me to if that helps any,” Agatha offers.</p><p>“What if they keep me overnight?”</p><p>Agatha hadn’t anticipated that question, but she looks around anyway. “I guess I’ll ask them to bring in a cot?”</p><p>Rio chews the inside of her cheek, clearly making some kind of decision, and then stares at her lap. “No, that’s selfish. You have the kids.”</p><p>Agatha gasps, she can’t help it, and she’s never wanted to kiss anyone more than she wants to kiss Rio in this moment. She obviously can’t right now, but… that statement is everything she could have hoped for. She picks up the hand without the IV and kisses the back of it instead. “How about I stay until the kids’ bedtime?”</p><p>Rio makes a soft noise at the kiss and nods at the suggestion. “Okay.”</p><p>“I don’t know if it means anything right now, but… I’m proud of you for that,” Agatha says, biting her lip.</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flush and she squeezes Agatha’s hand, but doesn’t say anything about it. Instead she clears her throat and asks a question. “Why aren’t hospitals your favorite?”</p><p>“Let me get my chair,” Agatha says, reluctantly releasing Rio’s hand and going to pull the chair closer so she can sit by the bed and get off her feet.</p><p>When she sits back down, Rio reaches for her hand again, so she takes it, absently rubbing her thumb over Rio’s knuckles.</p><p>“When Nicky was six years old, he was really sick. The doctors couldn’t figure out what was wrong with him. We spent a lot of time in hospitals, most of which I sat by his bed wondering if he was going to make it.”</p><p>Rio won’t look at her anymore. She’s looking anywhere else. “What was it?”</p><p>“We never found out for sure. They thought some kind of infection, and he ended up septic. He almost died, twice, before the antibiotics finally worked. They pumped his little body full of so many potent antibiotics that even after the sepsis was under control, he had stomach issues for weeks.” She lifts her free hand to wipe the moisture from under her eyes and sniffs. “He was always smiling, Rio. He never wanted me to worry.”</p><p>Rio curls her fingers lightly against Agatha’s palm in a gesture that could easily be dismissed as an involuntary twitch, but Agatha knows better. It’s Rio’s way of trying to comfort her when she doesn’t know how to comfort anyone. “He sounds like an amazing kid,” she says.</p><p>“He is,” Agatha agrees. “He always has been.” She scoots her chair closer so she can straighten up a little, because the way she had it she was leaning forward and her back muscles are getting tired. “So why don’t you like hospitals?”</p><p>Rio’s hand tightens around hers, and this, Agatha can tell, is actually involuntary. “I try not to think about it,” she says, and her breathing is getting heavy.</p><p>Now is not the time to push. “Okay, don’t think about it,” Agatha says quickly. “Let’s talk about something else. What’s your favorite movie?”</p><p>“I don’t have one.”</p><p>“Because you love too many movies, or…?”</p><p>“I don’t watch movies.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because they always made me want to be somebody else.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha whispers, sadness settling over her like a shroud. “That’s heartbreaking. You don’t need to be somebody else.”</p><p>“Who am I, Agatha? I’m an empty shell.”</p><p>“I thought that at first too, but you’re not,” Agatha says. “You’re not. You’re incredibly complex. You’re sensitive. And when you’re submitting to me you’re so, so sweet.” She drops her voice at the last part in case anyone walks past the room.</p><p>Rio’s lips part on a soft gasp and her cheeks dust pink.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t elaborate on that subject because she doesn’t want the alarms going off. But there’s a knock on the door frame anyway that keeps her from saying something else.</p><p>The doctor, she presumes due to the lab coat and clipboard, comes in after knocking and introduces herself. “Hello, I’m Dr. Hammond,” she says to Agatha, then looks at Rio. “How are you feeling, Rio?”</p><p>“I just want to go home,” Rio says.</p><p>“We’re doing everything we can to get you there,” the doctor says. “Good news on your troponin levels, they’re within the normal range, so there’s no injury to your heart muscle.”</p><p>Agatha’s brain starts racing because she hadn’t known that was a possibility. Thank god it didn’t happen, but suddenly knowing that it could have happened makes her anxious.</p><p>“So I can go then?” Rio asks, perking up.</p><p>“We want to keep you overnight for observation, and to make sure we really have your body temperature regulated and the tachycardia under control. You’re still getting hot and your heart races when the meds wear off. That’s not what we want to see when considering discharge, okay?”</p><p>“I don’t care about any of that. I’ll take an ice bath and a sleeping pill.”</p><p>Agatha’s horrified, her eyes going wide as she stares at Rio in disbelief. “You’ll do no such thing,” she says before she can think twice. “If the doctor says you’re staying until those things are regulated, you’re staying until those things are regulated.”</p><p>“No I’m not,” Rio says, and reaches for the IV, but Agatha gently grabs her wrist and leans up to whisper in her ear so the doctor can’t hear.</p><p>“Please be a good girl…”</p><p>Rio goes completely still, her arm slack in Agatha’s grip, and the tiniest of whimpers passes her lips. “Okay,” she squeaks.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha says as she settles back in her chair.</p><p>The doctor looks between them and when she decides it’s her turn to speak, she addresses Rio. “I promise I’ll get you out of here as soon as humanly possible.”</p><p>Rio just bites her lip and nods.</p><p>The doctor smiles at them both and leaves.</p><p>Rio lets out a heavy exhale and cuts her eyes toward Agatha. “You didn’t play fair.”</p><p>Agatha squeezes her hand. “I never do.”</p>

<p>Agatha’s right about that. Not once has that woman ever played fair. But really? Whispering in her ear about being a good girl so she won’t leave the hospital? That is downright playing dirty. Every minute she’s here makes her skin crawl. The worst part about it will be staying the night, when it gets quiet, dark, and eerie. And that’ll be the part Agatha won’t be there for.</p><p>But she shouldn’t get used to having Agatha around, anyway. It’s probably just guilt making her visit the hospital in the first place. Not that any of this is her fault. She knows Agatha blames herself, and eventually Rio will be able to vocalize that it’s not her fault. Even though she was trying to escape the feelings Agatha provoked, if it hadn’t been that, it would’ve been something else. She’s not short on excuses to get high. Something’s blocking her from letting Agatha off the hook yet, though. Probably because she’s afraid that if Agatha doesn’t feel at least partially responsible for the… incident… she’ll leave. And as fucked up as it is, Rio would rather have her here out of guilt than not at all.</p><p>Maybe it is just because she’s an addict, but she can’t shake the craving for those scraps of Agatha’s attention.</p><p>Silence has settled between them, but Agatha’s still holding her hand. She shouldn’t get used to that, either. She should probably pull her hand away. She will in a few minutes. Right now she’s just going to close her eyes and relax.</p><p>--</p><p>When she opens her eyes again, it’s dark out. She must’ve slept for hours this time. And—she sucks in a sharp little breath because Agatha’s asleep with her head on the edge of the bed and she’s still holding Rio’s hand.</p><p>Thousands of conflicting feelings bombard her from every direction and quickly overwhelm her to the point she shakes Agatha awake. “Hey,” she says when Agatha lifts her head and rubs at her eyes. “It’s dark out, the kids probably need you.”</p><p>Agatha looks confused, and turns her head to look out the windows. “What the fuck?” she mumbles. “Was I asleep?”</p><p>“Yeah, and I’m sure the kids need you,” Rio says in a rush. “You should probably go tuck them in or something.”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip and Rio doesn’t know what’s funny, so she frowns in response.</p><p>“They’re sixteen and seventeen, they don’t like being tucked in anymore,” Agatha says softly. “You’re panicking at having emotions and you need me to leave. It’s okay.”</p><p>Rio feels her face get warm and looks away from Agatha. She doesn’t like being so easily read. “That’s not it,” she lies.</p><p>“It’s okay,” Agatha says again, and gently withdraws her hand.</p><p>Rio feels the loss like a sledgehammer to the ribs, and her fingers curl instinctively, reaching out to chase the touch. She pulls back right away, but the damage is done; she knows Agatha saw.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t tease her, mercifully. She just walks to the door and waves. “See you in the morning,” she says, like the sun doesn’t rise and set in her eyes.</p><p>--</p><p>Rio wishes she hadn’t napped for so long earlier, because now she’s trying to sleep to avoid the creepy night vibe of the hospital and she can’t. Shadows lurk around every corner and behind every piece of machinery or furniture. She wants to sleep, but if she closes her eyes and can’t fall asleep she’s afraid of what might sneak up on her. Silent footsteps in the dark are terrifying.</p><p>After thinking something’s going to jump out at her one too many times, she jabs the button to call the nurse. It’s a different nurse than earlier because they switched shifts at eleven.</p><p>“Can I please have something to sleep?” she asks, voice hoarse with nerves.</p><p>“I’ll see when you’re due for your B-52,” the nurse says, picking up her chart from the wall.</p><p>“Please, I can’t sleep,” Rio says, starting to feel edgy.</p><p>“I understand, but if we give you too many sedatives, your respiratory system could suppress,” the nurse says. She glances over the chart and puts it back in the box on the wall. “Luckily, it’s been long enough that I can give you another dose.”</p><p>Rio breathes with relief, trying to calm her raging anxiety.</p><p>The nurse disappears and comes back with a syringe, and feeds the medication into her IV.</p><p>Then she’s alone again. Which used to feel better than it does now.</p><p>Her nerves rattle on for another five or ten minutes, and her mind is playing tricks on her by the time she drifts off to sleep, because the looming presence of her brother feels like it’s hovering just out of sight. It has to be a trick, though, because he’s dead. It’s not him, it’s just the memory of him.</p><p>Thankfully, if she dreams, she doesn’t remember.</p><p>She wakes up in the morning, and her entire body feels like it was beat to hell – not just her ass. Sunlight filters in through the windows to her right, and she hates that the first thing she does is look for Agatha.</p><p>Of course Agatha’s not there, and it was stupid to think she might be.</p><p>There’s a knock on the door frame and her heart skips but it’s just the nurse coming in to change her fluids.</p><p>But then the nurse speaks.</p><p>“Your girlfriend called and said she’s bringing you some breakfast and your cell phone,” she says as she unhooks the bag of saline.</p><p>Rio’s face goes hot and her hands go clammy and her heart starts racing, and the alarms go off.</p><p>“She’s not your girlfriend, is she?” the nurse says casually as she turns off the alarms and changes out the saline bag, hanging a new one and hooking it up.</p><p>“No,” Rio croaks.</p><p>“But you want her to be.”</p><p>Rio glares at the nurse. “I want nothing.”</p><p>“Your little racing heart says otherwise,” the woman says with a wink and leaves.</p><p>Rio puts a hand to her forehead because she feels like she’s going to pass right the fuck back out. Agatha’s bringing her breakfast? She pushes the button to get the nurse back in.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“Did she <em>say</em> she was my girlfriend when she called?”</p><p>The nurse coughs into her fist. Rio knows she’s trying not to laugh. Goddamn nurse. “No, but that’s what she told one of the other nurses last night when she was trying to sneak back in here.”</p><p>“Never mind,” Rio mutters.</p><p>“Never mind? You already asked and I already answered, you can’t never mind that,” the nurse says, and now she does laugh as she disappears again.</p><p>Rio just lays there – because what else can she do, really? – and thinks about Agatha. Sadly that’s becoming par for the course. She wonders what Agatha will bring her to eat since Agatha really doesn’t know what she likes. The only food she’s ever mentioned is salad. Maybe Agatha will bring her a salad for breakfast? She’s not sure how she feels about that. She actually doesn’t eat breakfast very often at all. But she doesn’t think that fact will save her if Agatha wants her to eat.</p><p>Her startling inability to say no to that woman is something she’d rather not reflect on, so she switches gears in her thoughts and thinks about her niece.</p><p>Why did her brother and that fucking floozy choose her to look after Valentina? Was it a joke and they just died before they got around to changing their will? But then… who goes to the trouble of putting a joke in their will?</p><p>Was it one last fuck you? Was it his way of saying she can never escape him? That even in death, he’s still pulling the strings? The thought makes her sick.</p><p>Thankfully her downward spiral is interrupted by a knock on the door frame and she looks over to see Agatha with a bright smile – one she’s never been given before and that lights up Agatha’s entire face and makes Rio’s breath catch.</p><p>Her eyes travel downward and she sees a plate in Agatha’s hand covered in tinfoil. Her throat goes dry when she connects the dots to realize Agatha <em>made</em> her breakfast. Her brain short circuits, because what?</p><p>“Are you going to be rude or are you going to invite me in?” Agatha asks, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Rio flushes and lifts her eyes back to Agatha’s face. “Come in,” she says, her voice much too cracked for her appreciation.</p><p>Agatha strolls over to the bed and pulls Rio’s tray so it’s in front of her, and puts down the plate. She peels off the tinfoil and Rio is staring at scrambled eggs, toast, bacon, and sausage.</p><p>Her mouth waters at the smell of it. The meat looks perfectly browned and the eggs are fluffy, and the toast has butter all the way to the edges just how she likes it, but Agatha couldn’t have known that. Any amount of dry toast makes Rio want to kill someone.</p><p>There’s a fork on one side of the plate and Rio swallows hard because these dishes came from Agatha’s kitchen.</p><p>“Well?” Agatha asks expectantly. “Why aren’t you eating?”</p><p>The presumptuousness makes Rio want to toy with her a little, and she plasters on slightly wide eyes as she picks up the fork. “I’m a vegetarian,” she says.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t miss a beat. “Not today you’re not.”</p><p>Rio almost moans at that answer and gives up the ruse. “I was just joking,” she chokes out, looks at her plate again, and spears some eggs on the fork.</p><p>“I know,” Agatha says with a snort. “You don’t really think I’d try to make you eat meat if you were a vegetarian, do you?”</p><p>Rio’s chewing the bite of eggs so she doesn’t answer out loud, she just shrugs. Because honestly, she has no idea whether Agatha would try to do that. Agatha has done a lot of things. Rio’s not complaining, but she doesn’t know where Agatha would draw the line.</p><p>Agatha’s smile fades and her shoulders slump a little, and she sits in the chair that’s still next to Rio’s bed. “I wouldn’t,” she says quietly.</p><p>Rio swallows her food and nods. “Okay.” She spears another bit of eggs and puts them in her mouth.</p><p>“Rio, I wouldn’t,” Agatha says again, and Rio’s starting to get the impression that this is a lot more of a big deal to Agatha than it is to her.</p><p>She chews and swallows and nods again. “I said okay, that means I believe you,” she offers, not sure what else to say.</p><p>Agatha’s chewing her lip and it’s the first time Rio has ever seen her so unsure.</p><p>“Stop looking like that, it’s throwing off my sense of the world,” she says, because it’s awkward, and she doesn’t like seeing Agatha like this. She shovels in another bite of eggs to keep from having to talk any more.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes fill with tears and Rio freezes with her fork halfway to her mouth.</p><p>“This is my fault,” Agatha whispers, and her tears start to fall.</p><p>Rio’s going to have to let her off the hook now, even if it means Agatha’s guilt won’t keep her here any longer.</p><p>She sighs and sets down her fork, appreciating the quiet clink it makes when it touches the plate. “It’s really not,” she says. “I know you think it is, and maybe nothing I say will change your mind, but you’re not responsible for my fucked up choices. So you can stop feeling guilty and get on with your life, I promise. You don’t have to stay, because this isn’t your fault.”</p><p>Agatha stands so abruptly it startles Rio into jumping, and then hands are bracketing her head and Agatha’s face is an inch from her face. “You think I’m here out of guilt?”</p><p>Rio struggles to breathe, caught in the tractor beam of intensity. Her jaw opens but no words come out so she nods.</p><p>One of Agatha’s tears drops onto her face and she gasps, swiping her tongue out to taste it. The salty tang invades her mouth and spreads down her throat as she swallows. Her eyes flutter shut and she keeps them that way because she can’t handle the wounded look Agatha throws her.</p><p>“No, Rio,” Agatha chokes out, voice stuttering. “That’s not why I’m here.”</p><p>Rio keeps her eyes shut. “Then why?”</p><p>“I told you already. Because you could’ve died, and I’ve only just started getting to know you.”</p><p>“I don’t know what that means,” Rio says. Her heart’s starting to race and she doesn’t want the alarms going off. “Can you back up? My heart’s racing.”</p><p>Agatha backs off, Rio can hear her retreating, hear when she sits back down in the chair. “It means I don’t want you to die, Rio,” she says. “I don’t want you out of my life. I don’t know what the fuck this is, but it’s more than I thought it would be and the idea of you dying makes me violently ill. I’m just—I’m so—” She grunts in frustration and Rio finally opens her eyes in time to see her run a hand through her hair. “I’m here because I want to be here,” she finally says in conclusion.</p><p>“I don’t know what to do with that,” Rio says honestly. “I thought… I never thought… I thought you came because you felt bad, not because you wanted to see me.”</p><p>“I do want to see you,” Agatha says. “And I do feel bad. They’re not mutually exclusive. But feeling bad wouldn’t be enough to make me come to the hospital if I didn’t want to see you. I’m here for you. I—I didn’t want to leave like that this morning.”</p><p>“I don’t know how to do this,” Rio says, starting to feel desperate. She’s sober by now, and everything she’s feeling is magnified and sharp.</p><p>Agatha looks as lost as Rio feels, and wipes her eyes, then stares at her lap. “Do you want me to go?”</p><p>Rio panics. “No!” she nearly shouts.</p><p>And Agatha doesn’t look quite as lost, which in turn calms Rio the slightest bit. She focuses on her food, taking a bite of bacon, and it tastes so good she forgets about everything else for a minute.</p><p>“I don’t want you to go,” she says when she swallows. “Thank you for breakfast. It’s so good.” She keeps eating, because the more she eats the more she realizes how hungry she is.</p><p>She’s just about finished when there’s a knock and the doctor comes in. “Good morning Rio,” she says, and nods politely at Agatha. “How are you feeling?”</p><p>“Like I want to go home. I haven’t had any meds since I woke up and my heart rate has been fine, no alarms.”</p><p>“The alarms did go off this morning,” the doctor says. “But the nurse told me it was in response to external stimuli, so it won’t prevent you from being discharged. There is one thing I need to speak to you about before I can allow you to leave, however.”</p><p>“Okay, what is it?”</p><p>The doctor looks at Agatha. “Would you mind stepping out, please?”</p>

<p>Agatha stands up and drops her hand to brush Rio’s leg as she heads for the door. She closes it behind her and a few seconds later she hears Rio start screaming at the doctor, but she can’t make out the words. Something thuds against the door and Agatha jumps.</p><p>The doctor emerges shortly after, shutting the door behind her, and takes a deep breath.</p><p>“Did she throw something at you?”</p><p>“She did.”</p><p>“Sorry.” Agatha’s not sure why she feels the need to apologize on Rio’s behalf.</p><p>“I’m going to ask you about this then, because she refused to answer me and it’s a point of concern.”</p><p>Agatha’s anxiety starts ticking. “I’m not really her girlfriend, I probably won’t know the answer to whatever it is,” she says in a rush.</p><p>“But you’ve been around her recently, correct?”</p><p>Agatha nods. Where in the hell is this going?</p><p>“The nurses noticed some unusual marks and bruising on Rio’s backside when they were changing her into the gown,” she says. “Would you be able to tell me anything about them?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes bug and her cheeks are already burning before the doctor even finishes the question. “I—I—I—I—I—she—she—she—” She’s gesturing wildly and trying not to literally crumble to the ground and try to get sucked into the linoleum to get away from this situation.</p><p>The doctor’s amusement is obvious but muted. “Take your time.”</p><p>“Oh God,” Agatha finally says, running her hands through her hair. “What answer won’t have you calling the police on me?”</p><p>“Just go with the truth, please,” the doctor says, and her amusement is gone.</p><p>“Right, um,” Agatha says, rubbing her hands up and down the front of her pants. “I, um… she was, um… she, uh… I—I—I spanked her.”</p><p>Her head is about to explode. She’s never been so embarrassed in her life. She’s about to start crying again she’s so uncomfortable.</p><p>“What made the marks?”</p><p>“A hairbrush.” She’s going to literally die.</p><p>“Was the encounter consensual?”</p><p>“I’m—I think so,” Agatha croaks. Because now she’s second guessing herself, because Rio did shake her head a few times, so does that mean it wasn’t consensual? She didn’t use force, only words, so what does that make it? Now she’s terrified the doctor is going to call the police.</p><p>“What do you mean by ‘I think so’?” the doctor asks.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are stinging and she’s fighting tears as hard as she can. “Well she um, she shook her head no, but when I said yes, she came over, I didn’t force her, but she did shake her head so I—I don’t know what that makes it. Are you—am I in trouble with the authorities?”</p><p>“It doesn’t sound like I’ll need to call them, no,” the doctor says. “Thank you for being candid.”</p><p>Agatha’s so relieved she almost slides down the wall to sit on the floor. “You’re welcome,” she squeaks. “So um, can she go home then?”</p><p>“Yes, I’ll start the discharge paperwork. Will you be driving her?”</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>“I’ll have the nurse give the discharge instructions to you, then.”</p><p>“Thanks,” Agatha mumbles, her face still burning as she skulks back into the room and stalks over to the chair and sits down hard. “Are you serious, not answering their questions about your ass so that <em>I</em> had to do it?” she hisses.</p><p>“You answered their questions?” Rio says, eyes wide. “It’s none of their business!”</p><p>“She ambushed me! I had no choice!”</p><p>“You told the <em>truth</em>?” Rio shrieks.</p><p>“I didn’t have time to make something up! And what the hell else would I say anyway? How else are you gonna get bruises and marks on your ass?”</p><p>“I can’t,” Rio says, agitated. “I hope the EMTs didn’t dust my stash.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart drops into her stomach. “What?” she asks, an icy chill of dread spreading through her.</p><p>“They might have confiscated it,” Rio says, as if Agatha was asking for clarification and not absolutely devastated by the fact that Rio’s planning to continue using after this.</p><p>“Rio, that’s not—” She reaches for Rio’s hand, surprised but pleased that Rio lets her hold it. “I wasn’t asking you to explain why your stash might be gone, I was… I was… I guess I was hopeful you wouldn’t keep using after this,” she says, staring at their joined hands, unable to look at Rio’s beautiful face because she knows she’ll find anger or defensiveness and she can’t handle that right now.</p><p>“I’ll be more careful,” Rio says. “You said baby steps, didn’t you? Is that not—is that not still true?”</p><p>“But you could’ve died,” Agatha says, squeezing her hand. “What if it happens again even if you’re careful? What if now that you’ve overdosed, it takes less and less to overdose next time?”</p><p>“I can’t just stop just like that,” Rio says, a frown in her voice, but she doesn’t pull her hand away and Agatha takes that as a good sign. “I would have to wean down and I don’t even know if I want to do that.”</p><p>“I want that,” Agatha says quietly. It’s the first time she’s admitted it out loud, and she has no idea how Rio will take it, whether it will matter even the slightest bit.</p><p>Rio gasps, and Agatha finally looks at her, and her eyes are glassy. “You do?”</p><p>“More than anything,” Agatha breathes. “It hasn’t been obvious?”</p><p>Rio’s staring at her in awe now. “I don’t know,” she says, her voice shaky. “I’ve never been good at figuring out what people want.”</p><p>Agatha stands up and leans over Rio and kisses the corner of her mouth. “I want it.”</p><p>Rio moans, and the alarms start going off, and she rips the leads off of her chest and throws the wires over the side of the bed, then grabs the plug to the monitor and jerks it out of the wall.</p><p>The nurse comes in anyway, sees the carnage, shakes her head, and leaves.</p><p>Agatha kisses the same spot again, and again, and Rio arches up into her.</p><p>“I want it,” Agatha says again. She wants no room for misunderstanding or for Rio to think she isn’t serious.</p><p>Rio’s eyes are blown. “I’ll try,” she says in a rush of air.</p><p>“Honestly?” Agatha says, not daring to hope but hoping anyway.</p><p>Rio nods, and Agatha kisses her. Properly. Mouth to mouth, hard, unyielding. Rio’s lips are so soft… it’s surprising after what she’s just been through, but they’re so fucking soft Agatha could get lost in them. She licks across the bottom one and pulls it between her teeth, nibbling and sucking until Rio opens up.</p><p>She licks her way inside, over teeth and gums, sliding across Rio’s tongue with her own in a delicate but heated dance. The kiss says ‘I want you’. It says ‘I want you to be mine’. It says ‘please don’t die on me’.</p><p>The noises Rio is making filter into Agatha’s ears and spur her on. The kiss goes from exploratory to possessive in the blink of an eye, and she’s claiming every part of Rio’s mouth she touches.</p><p>Rio’s squirming and moaning and her hands grip Agatha’s waist to the point of discomfort.</p><p>When Agatha finally pulls back, she’s breathing harder than she has in a long time. “Did I say you could touch me?” she pants.</p><p>Rio snatches her hands away like they’re on fire and shakes her head, too winded to speak. The flush to her cheeks makes her look so vibrant, the exact opposite of the fragile way Agatha perceived her last night.</p><p>A throat clearing in the doorway draws her attention, and she sheepishly moves away from the bed, reaching her hand out for the discharge instructions when the nurse presents them to her.</p><p>“All right, Rio, you’re cleared to go home,” the nurse says after Agatha takes the papers. “Follow those discharge instructions to the letter or you’ll end up right back here.”</p><p>Rio pulls a face that makes Agatha want to laugh, but she bites her lip to keep quiet.</p><p>“Where are my clothes?” Rio demands.</p><p>“You were in nothing but a bathrobe,” the nurse says. “It’s on the counter by the window in a bag labeled with your name on it.” She moves to Rio’s side and starts the process of removing the IV.</p><p>While the nurse takes out the IV and tapes up Rio’s hand, Agatha goes to the window and takes the robe out of the bag, bringing it over.</p><p>“Just stop by registration on your way out and you’re good to go,” the nurse says, throws the supplies into the biohazard bin, and leaves.</p><p>Rio throws off the hospital gown and reaches for the robe, curling her fingers in an impatient gesture. “Gimme.”</p><p>Agatha snorts and tosses it at her, and once Rio is wrapped in it and gets out of the bed, the contrast of hospital grip socks and a silk robe finally does her in, and she lets out the laugh she’s been holding back. “Quite the fashion statement.”</p><p>Rio scoffs at her and sticks her tongue out. “If I wore this in a spread, thousands of people would be wearing it by the next day,” she says haughtily, and Agatha believes it. “I <em>am</em> a fashion statement.”</p><p>She’s a little unsteady when she walks so Agatha slings an arm around her waist. “Oh I have no doubt,” she says with a snicker.</p><p>They stop by registration on their way out, Rio gives her name, and the clerk clears her to leave.</p><p>Agatha leads the way to the car and helps Rio into the passenger seat.</p><p>“Fuck!” she shrieks, arching up off the seat, bracing herself on her hands.</p><p>Agatha’s startled by the sudden shriek and confused for a split second, then a flush of guilt spreads over her chest and warms her face. It hurts Rio to sit. “Do you want to lay in the back?” she asks, for lack of something better to do.</p><p>“No, I just need to be more careful. Slower,” Rio says, lowering herself very gingerly to sit.</p><p>Agatha watches, an apology on the tip of her tongue, but she bites it back and shuts the door, going around to get in on her side.</p><p>The drive is quiet and when they get to Rio’s house, Agatha shuts off the car and goes around to help her out. The front door is unlocked because Rio’s keys are still inside, and when Agatha had come by to get Rio’s phone she made sure not to lock the door.</p><p>“Where do you want to go, couch or bed?”</p><p>“Couch,” Rio says, leaning on Agatha as they step down into the living room. She stretches out on her stomach with a sigh.</p><p>Agatha knows she should probably leave, but the whole conversation with the doctor is gnawing at her and Rio’s never going to bring it up so she’s going to have to. She sits in an armchair and chews her lip.</p><p>Rio’s got her arms folded beneath her head and she’s just looking at Agatha, not staring exactly, just… looking.</p><p>It takes a few minutes to get up the nerve, but finally she forces the words out. “Rio, I… the doctor asked me something that I wasn’t sure how to answer, and it’s tearing me apart.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t move, just asks quietly, “What was the question?”</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks are burning again and she darts her eyes away, focusing on the carpet off to the left, fingers plucking at the hem of her shirt. “She asked if that sp—that beating was consensual.” She remembers at the last second Rio prefers to call it a beating.</p><p>Nothing registers on Rio’s face. “Why weren’t you sure how to answer?”</p><p>Okay, that makes Agatha feel marginally better, if she’s interpreting it right. “Because you shook your head no. Twice.”</p><p>“So would anyone about to get their ass beat, wouldn’t they?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I’ve never done that to anyone before.”</p><p>“It was consensual,” Rio lets her off the hook explicitly, for which she is so fucking grateful.</p><p>She gets off the chair and kneels on the floor next to the sofa. “Are you sure? You’re not just saying that to make me feel better?”</p><p>“I have perfect clarity at the moment, which I hate by the way. I’m sure. If I wasn’t okay with it I would have thrown hands.”</p><p>“Even—even though I was using the tie?”</p><p>“Mhmm.”</p><p>“Okay,” she finally accepts the answer, the guilt clawing at her insides loosening its grip at last. “Okay.”</p><p>“I didn’t like it, to be clear, but it was consensual.”</p><p>Agatha nods. “I didn’t get the impression you liked it. I didn’t mean for you to like it.”</p><p>Rio nods too.</p><p>“Are you really gonna try?” Agatha asks then, nerves twisting her up instead of guilt.</p><p>Rio nods again.</p><p>“I know our situation is weird, but you do mean something to me.”</p><p>“I know,” Rio whispers. “You’ve shown me that. It terrifies me.”</p><p>“Me too.”</p>

<p>The fact that Agatha’s scared too helps Rio settle a little, but her heart is still hammering and her pulse is still roaring in her ears. She feels shaky and out of sorts, and the craving for oblivion is getting stronger by the minute. “Can I say something without you thinking I’m trying to manipulate you?” she asks, because the truth is trying so hard to escape.</p><p>“Of course,” Agatha says, and lays a hand on her hip.</p><p>Her skin burns through her robe. Agatha’s touch is like a brand. “I don’t want to take up all your time but if you leave I’m going straight upstairs for some blow,” she confesses. Agatha will probably get angry, she knows, but she doesn’t want to lie. Not to the one person she feels connected to.</p><p>Agatha squeezes her hip and lets out a slow breath through her nose. “I’ve already called off work for the day so…”</p><p>Rio’s stomach clenches. “You’re not mad?”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head. “I understand addiction, Rio. I can’t always be here as a deterrent, but it’s only day one, and I’ll stay as long as I can.”</p><p>The other thing suddenly hits her and she’s so confused and dysregulated she doesn’t know what to do. “You called off work?”</p><p>Agatha ignores the question. “How often do you use? I’m guessing multiple times daily?”</p><p>Rio tries to wrap her head around this line of inquiry. “Usually, yeah.”</p><p>“And how much do you typically… ingest… in one sitting?”</p><p>Rio’s brain hurts. “Two lines usually. Sometimes one, sometimes three.”</p><p>“So between three and nine lines a day,” Agatha calculates.</p><p>“According to the laws of arithmetic,” Rio says, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>“You’re funny when you’re sober,” Agatha drawls. “Other than not wanting to detox, what keeps you using?”</p><p>Rio’s panic button trips and she shakes her head wildly. She can’t share those things. Not with anyone, and especially not with someone she actually wants to be around. Agatha would never look at her the same way. No one knows what she suffered, and no one ever will.</p><p>She must look even more panicked than she feels because Agatha immediately apologizes. “Hey, I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have asked that,” she says, and Rio feels the hand on her hip start sliding up and down, burning trails on her skin.</p><p>“It’s okay,” she chokes out, trying to sound unaffected and failing miserably. Goddamn fucking being sober. “Agatha I need something,” she says, and she knows she probably looks as pathetic as Agatha likes to call her. “I—I know it’s pathetic, but I—”</p><p>“It <em>is</em> pathetic,” Agatha says in a low, smoky voice, and Rio’s instantly wet because <em>oh</em>, they’re doing <em>that</em>.</p><p>She bites her lip and nods, lost to Agatha’s narrative.</p><p>“The baby can’t go one day without stuffing her face full of drugs.”</p><p>Rio hears herself moan even though she didn’t tell her throat to conjure that sound or her mouth to release it. More slick pumps out and wets her thighs because she’s not wearing any panties. “Fuck,” she breathes.</p><p>Agatha leans closer. Rio can feel the warmth on her face when the other woman exhales. “Poor little Rio… can’t handle even the simplest of emotions, can you?”</p><p>She knows she’s looking at Agatha like a lost puppy but she can’t help it. She shakes her head in response, words lost to her. All she knows is Agatha’s voice and the tightness in her belly and the uncomfortable wetness between her legs. She doesn’t realize she’s squirming until a hand comes to rest lightly on her lower back, applying the subtlest of pressure to still her hips.</p><p>“I didn’t tell you to move.” The words come sharply in her ear, and she cries out, soft and needy.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she says, almost on autopilot. When Agatha uses that tone with her it turns her inside out. All she wants in the world is to hear Agatha call her <em>good</em>. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry…” The apologies come tumbling out one after another. “I’ll be good.”</p><p>“Will you?” Agatha tuts at her, and sounds unconvinced.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio swears, desperate to make Agatha believe her. “I won’t move, I won’t.”</p><p>“Such a whiny, needy little slut, aren’t you?” Agatha says with a condescending laugh that makes Rio’s thighs clench.</p><p>She knows better than to not answer. “Yes,” she says.</p><p>“Tell me.”</p><p>Agatha fists a handful of her hair and she groans.</p><p>“I’m a whiny, needy little slut,” she echoes.</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>Fuck, fuck, she’s meant to think? She has no idea what to say, what else is she that Agatha would want to hear right now, she doesn’t know—“Yours,” she hears herself say.</p><p>Agatha’s hand tightens in her hair and it hurts. “Jesus Christ, Rio,” she says, and the condescending, haughty tone is gone. Agatha sounds breathless.</p><p>But it still feels like a scolding and Rio thinks maybe she said the wrong thing. “I’m sorry, I—”</p><p>Agatha covers her mouth and presses hard. “Don’t apologize.”</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The instant she covers Rio’s mouth, Rio screams and shrinks away from her, curling into a protective position with her arms over her face, babbling ninety miles a minute.</p><p>“Don’t cover my mouth please don’t cover my mouth please please I’ll be quiet I’ll be quiet I’ll shut up I promise please don’t please don’t please—”</p><p>All of those words come out in the span of two seconds and Agatha doesn’t know what to do so she backs away from the couch to give Rio space and interrupts the pleading in a gentle voice. “I won’t,” she says, her hands shaking. “I won’t, Rio, I’m sorry,” she continues when the initial promise doesn’t lead to more begging.</p><p>Her heart is slamming against her ribs double time and her chest is so tight she can barely breathe.</p><p>Rio is shaking like a leaf, she can see it even from where she backed up to, several feet away. “It’s okay, you’re safe,” she says, because what in the fuck is she supposed to do?</p><p>When Rio finally calms and uncovers her face, there’s a look of dread on it. Agatha’s sure this was not something Rio ever wanted her to see.</p><p>“Can I—can I sit next to you?” she stutters, unsure of herself and her place in the recovery from this trauma.</p><p>Rio slowly nods, her eyes taking on a vacant air.</p><p>Agatha inches closer, and when Rio doesn’t back away or flinch, she lowers herself to sit and opens up her arms in case Rio wants to be held.</p><p>Almost as soon as she moves her arms Rio launches into them, pressed so tightly against her, still shaking violently.</p><p>Agatha folds her into a protective embrace, heart breaking, and rubs her back. “I’m so sorry,” she whispers. “I didn’t know.”</p><p>Rio just clings to her, face tucked into her neck. The only thing Agatha finds a little odd is there are no tears. Rio’s not crying. And the reasons for that are too horrific to imagine, so she doesn’t. Rio will tell her things when she’s ready.</p><p>“I will never, ever do that to you again,” Agatha says. “Never.”</p><p>Rio nods, she can feel the movement.</p><p>“God, I’m sorry,” Agatha apologizes yet again, because she just doesn’t know what else to do.</p><p>“It’s not your fault,” Rio finally says. “But I need something, <em>right</em> now. I’m sorry. I understand if you’ll be gone when I get back.”</p><p>Agatha watches her get up and disappear up the stairs, and sits wondering what would be worse – staying and seeing Rio fucked up again, losing the parts of her personality they’ve just begun to discover, or leaving, preserving this interaction but sending the message she only wants Rio if she’s sober; that her interest and her care is conditional?</p><p>She stays, because of course she stays. There’s no offshoot of reality anymore where she doesn’t stay.</p><p>Rio freezes halfway down the stairs, and Agatha can read the surprise from the living room.</p><p>A minute later Rio sits on the sofa next to her. “You’re not gone.”</p><p>“Not gone,” Agatha echoes. “How many lines did you do?”</p><p>Rio holds up a finger. “Just one. I really am going to try.”</p><p>Agatha needs somewhere to put her hands before she grabs Rio up and ravishes her. So she sits on them. “I’m so proud,” she says, and she doesn’t mean it to start ramping Rio up again, but it does.</p><p>She leans back against the armrest and drops one leg off the edge of the sofa, bending her other one at the knee and resting it so her thighs are open. The robe does nothing to hide her pussy in that position and Agatha’s eyes are drawn to it.</p><p>She drags her gaze back up to blown pupils and parted lips and flushed cheeks. Rio is fucking magnificent.</p><p>“Touch,” she says softly, and Rio does.</p><p>Her mouth waters, watching Rio finger herself, and she has to taste. But she’s not going to cross the boundary she set, not yet, so she grabs Rio’s wrist.</p><p>“Stop,” she says, and brings Rio’s hand to her mouth, sucking the slick off of her index finger. She makes an appreciative noise, because Rio tastes flawless.</p><p>Rio’s staring at her in disbelief but doesn’t withdraw or protest.</p><p>Agatha puts her hand back where it was and lets go. “Go,” she commands, her voice still soft.</p><p>Rio, ever the quick study, pushes her finger back inside herself, understanding the game immediately.</p><p>“What do you say?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw works for a second as she moves her finger in and out. “Thank you?” she guesses.</p><p>“You’re welcome ba—Rio,” Agatha says, cutting herself off quickly but not quickly enough. God damnit.</p><p>Rio moans and arches her back, her finger picking up speed. “It’s—you can—I—I like—” She stops talking and focuses, chewing her lip and lowering her other hand to pinch and pull at her clit.</p><p>“Stop,” Agatha says, and Rio whines, but both of her hands instantly still. “Good girl.”</p><p>Rio moans again, breathing heavy, chest rising and falling so hard Agatha worries for a second that it’ll be too much after the hospital trip.</p><p>“Please,” Rio begs, blinking up at her.</p><p>Agatha knows she wants to make herself come now, but requests clarification anyway. “Please what?”</p><p>Rio’s answer makes her realize she should never, ever assume.</p><p>“Please call me baby.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Agatha breathes, her brain metaphorically rattling in her skull as she stares down at Rio, spread open for her and begging for pet names. “Choose. Calling you baby or letting you come.”</p><p>Rio makes a strangled sound but her eyes are wide and locked on Agatha. “Calling me baby,” she whispers.</p><p>Agatha’s stomach clenches as hard as her cunt and she leans forward, bracing her hands on either side of Rio’s shoulders so she can drop her mouth to Rio’s ear. “Okay baby,” she purrs.</p><p>Rio comes unglued.</p><p>Her hips jerk and her hands come off her pussy, shooting behind her to grip the armrest under her head, and a low, keening cry pours out of her throat and curls around Agatha’s ears like smoke.</p><p>“Please please please please please,” Rio chants like a prayer, and Agatha feels pressure on her back, taking a moment to realize Rio’s legs are wrapped around her and trying to pull her down.</p><p>She goes, settling herself fully on top of Rio, but husks in her ear, “get your legs off me.”</p><p>Rio cries out and the pressure is gone, and Agatha hears her right foot hit the floor again and feels the left one squeeze between her and the back of the sofa.</p><p>“Is this going to become a habit? Touching me without asking?” Her full weight is pinning Rio to the sofa and Rio wildly shakes her head.</p><p>“No, no it isn’t, I just forgot myself,” she swears. “I’ll be good.”</p><p><em>This</em> repeated promising is so different from the terrified promising to be quiet that it’s obvious, and Agatha is grateful for that, because if there was any question, she wouldn’t be able to keep pushing. “You’ve done it twice today,” Agatha reminds her. “Not a good start, baby.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes roll back and a sharp cry wails out, and she’s clawing the fabric that covers the sofa’s armrest because her hands are the only part of her (besides her head) not pinned down. And that’s only because she has them above her head where Agatha’s body can’t reach.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” she pants, throwing her head side to side and moaning like a little whore. “I—I—I—I’ll keep my hands to myself,” she adds, so far gone Agatha might have to try pulling her back a little. “A—a—and my legs.” She shudders and presses herself up into Agatha’s restraint.</p><p>Everywhere they’re touching feels like fire even through Agatha’s clothes. She’s so wet it’s ridiculous. She would never have thought hearing someone beg like that would tear her so violently apart. But it does. Oh, it does. “I’m not convinced,” she huffs into Rio’s ear.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio says, broken, still squirming relentlessly, desperate to make Agatha believe her if the whine she lets out is any indication. “How can I make you believe me?” she asks, still with an undertone of whining to the words.</p><p>“Just keep telling me,” Agatha breathes, flicking her tongue against the side of Rio’s face. “Keep begging. Keep apologizing. I want it all.”</p><p>Rio groans and arches her throat up toward the ceiling, then flops back down and resumes her squirming. “I’m sorry Agatha, I’ll be good for you, I promise I’ll be a good girl and stop touching you without asking… I swear, I want to be so good, I’ll be your good girl, please please please believe me, please Agatha, I’m so sorry…”</p><p>“Mmm. More,” Agatha says, kissing her cheek.</p><p>Rio squeaks and pushes her body up against Agatha again. “I won’t touch you without permission, I’ve learned my lesson… you’re in charge and I’m not allowed to touch you, please I’ll be so fucking good,” she groans, letting her muscles go slack again, and Agatha misses the pressure.</p><p>“More,” she growls.</p><p>Rio’s pupils are so blown Agatha wouldn’t know her eyes were brown. And she’s never seen anyone in such constant motion. The girl cannot hold still for the life of her.</p><p>“I’m sorry Agatha,” she says, her voice cracked and carried on a pleading whine. “Please, fuck, I don’t know what else to say except I promise to be good, I promise so fucking hard to be your good girl, I’ll make you proud of me, fuck, I swear…”</p><p>Agatha’s clit is throbbing so bad and the power rushing to her head is so strong she’s afraid she might lose the ability to resist touching Rio. Her arms are shaking with the effort to stay where they are and her weight feels too comfortable pinning Rio to the sofa. She shifts her center of gravity lower and presses a knee between Rio’s legs. “I <em>am</em> proud of you,” she says.</p><p>Rio grinds down instantly and lets out a cry toward the ceiling. Agatha watches, not moving a muscle as Rio falls over the edge from that minimal contact and those weighted words, shuddering and shaking and mewling pathetically, and then, finally, for the first time since Agatha pinned her down, she lays still.</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to say something about it, but Rio beats her to it.</p><p>“I didn’t mean to,” Rio whispers. “You just tear me apart so easily. Please don’t punish me, Agatha, it was an accident…”</p><p>Agatha’s amusement fades in the wake of Rio’s heartfelt response, and whatever teasing she was going to issue dies on her tongue. She pushes herself up to sit and grabs Rio around the back of the neck, dragging her up as well, and Rio whimpers at the pressure on her ass but seems otherwise happy to be pulled into Agatha’s arms.</p><p>“You’ll do better next time, hmm?” she hums, nuzzling Rio’s temple with her nose.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says, curling up with her face against Agatha’s neck. “Promise.”</p><p>Agatha strokes her sweaty hair and rubs up and down her back almost absently, lost in thought for a while, and when she gathers up the nerve she finally says softly, “so… why—”</p><p>“Don’t,” Rio interrupts, going rigid under her hands. “Please don’t. Please.”</p><p>Agatha moves her hands to frame Rio’s face and make the other woman look at her. “Why?” She’s not trying to make it sound like she’s arguing, because she’s not, really, she just desperately wants to know more about Rio, especially after that trigger.</p><p>Rio just shakes her head the best she can with it in Agatha’s grip.</p><p>Agatha brushes her thumbs back and forth over Rio’s cheeks. “What if I do something else to cause a reaction like that? I don’t want that, Rio…”</p><p>“I’ll hide it better,” Rio says, eyes desperately pleading with Agatha to drop it.</p><p>Agatha’s heart breaks a little and she shakes her head. “I don’t want you to hide anything. I’ve gotten a glimpse of the real you and I like her. A lot.”</p><p>“You’d run.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t.”</p><p>“You <em>would</em>.”</p><p>“You don’t trust me?”</p><p>“I do, I just…”</p><p>“You trust me with your body but not your mind? I want <em>both</em>.” God, she desperately wants inside Rio’s head.</p><p>“I like having you want me,” Rio says, closing her eyes. “If I tell you anything, you won’t want me anymore.”</p><p>Agatha’s on the verge of tears already. “Open your eyes.”</p><p>Rio squeezes them shut tighter but then flutters them open and looks at her.</p><p>“Nothing that happened to you in the past would ever change how much I want you now. <em>Ever</em>. The only thing that can change how much I want you is—actually I don’t even know if that exists. I’m always going to want you. You’re as much of an addiction to me as I am to you. I <em>want</em> to know. Please. Please trust me with your mind.”</p><p>Rio looks so lost… all Agatha wants to do is be her anchor.</p><p>“I’ll tell you one thing,” she finally says, her voice wispy and uncertain. “To see if you treat me different.”</p><p>“I won’t,” Agatha says.</p><p>“I think you will,” Rio insists. “My brother used to keep me in a cage.”</p><p>The horror that forms in the pit of her stomach is powerful enough to choke her, and she grabs Rio around the back of the neck, letting out a quiet noise of anguish as she crushes the other woman against her.</p><p>“See? Now you’ll never humiliate me again,” Rio complains quietly, but allows herself to be squished.</p><p>Agatha realizes the importance of this moment. Her response to that is going to determine whether Rio can ever accept that her past doesn’t have to define her and will not change Agatha’s opinion of her or behavior toward her.</p><p>“Maybe I wouldn’t if you weren’t an insatiable little slut,” Agatha says into her ear. “But you are… aren’t you, Rio? You’re mine, remember? My little whore. Never satisfied.”</p><p>Rio gasps, fingernails digging into Agatha’s back.</p><p>“Say it,” Agatha demands.</p><p>“I’m yours,” Rio echoes immediately, her voice as blown as Agatha knows her pupils have to be. “Your little whore. I’m never satisfied.”</p><p>“No matter how much I give you, you always want more, don’t you?”</p><p>“<em>Yes</em>.”</p><p>“Because you’re such a spoiled fucking brat. You want all my time. All my attention. And still it’s never enough. Because you’re <em>selfish</em>.”</p><p>Rio moans against her chest.</p><p>“Believe me yet?” Agatha whispers, kissing the shell of her ear.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio pants softly.</p><p>“I can be horrified and heartbroken about what you went through without it affecting my current feelings.”</p><p>“I’ve never told anyone anything so… I don’t have anything to go by except my fears.”</p><p>“You can tell me everything, Rio. And I’ll protect you,” Agatha promises. “But I won’t treat you differently. I won’t change.”</p><p>“I can’t say everything at once, it’ll kill me,” Rio whispers.</p><p>“A little at a time,” Agatha whispers back, and lets Rio fold into her again, releasing the hold on her face.</p><p>“My father was… too attentive when I was young,” Rio starts, her voice lacking any intonation, and Agatha knows she’s separating herself from the story. “I told my kindergarten teacher and he was sent to prison. He got stabbed to death in prison and my mother killed herself. My brother blamed me. He said I should’ve kept my mouth shut, so he did everything he could to make me invisible for years and years.”</p><p>Agatha can’t help tearing up, but she tries to keep it out of her voice. “You were five?” she asks softly, and Rio nods into her chest. “And do <em>you</em> know it wasn’t your fault?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio answers. “I tried to tell him. He just…” She shakes her head.</p><p>“He put something over your mouth if you wouldn’t be quiet,” Agatha guesses.</p><p>“All the time. It was hard to breathe,” Rio chokes out. “Can we be done for today please?”</p><p>“Yes, you’re so good,” Agatha praises her, kissing the top of her head. There’s an ache in her chest that’s not going to go away any time soon, but she’ll gladly bear that burden to get to know Rio better. “You’re so good, Rio,” she croons. “And I will never cover your mouth again. Anything that triggers you, I’ll never do it. But everything else, I promise not to stop.”</p>

<p>Rio wants so badly to believe her, and she partially does, but she’s never trusted anyone and it’s so, so hard when she doesn’t know how. So far Agatha’s not treating her any differently, but that could change at any moment.</p><p>The embrace she’s in feels strange and amazing at the same time. She wants to run as far away as she can while staying right where she is.</p><p>She flashes back to a few minutes ago, to Agatha saying she likes her, a lot, and a warm feeling starts to simmer in her chest. No one’s ever said they liked her. Even the people who always fall all over themselves trying to compliment her and be her friend have never said they liked her.</p><p>Because they don’t.</p><p>They like her money and her prestige. They like her house and her drugs. They like her booze and her VIP access. They don’t like <em>her</em>.</p><p>But Agatha says she does.</p><p>And then Rio realizes she never responded to that because they were in the middle of something more important.</p><p>“I like you too,” she blurts out.</p><p>She feels Agatha chuckle where her head is pressed to the other woman’s chest. “A lot?”</p><p>Rio chews her lip and nods. “A lot.”</p><p>She feels lips press to the top of her head. “I already knew that, but thank you for telling me anyway.”</p><p>“What do we do now?” Rio has no idea.</p><p>“Now we sit here and I hold you for as long as you want.”</p><p>“Oh,” Rio breathes, that warmth in her chest starting a slow pulse through the rest of her body.</p><p>“And then…” Agatha sounds almost hesitant, which is new, so Rio picks her head up to look at her. She <em>looks</em> hesitant too.</p><p>Rio swallows her sudden nerves to ask, “what is it?”</p><p>“Then maybe you come to my house for dinner and a game or two.”</p><p>Rio can’t help the gasp that leaves her lips, because she never thought she’d get invited to Agatha’s house. “But—but won’t your son be there?” she stammers. There’s no way Agatha’s going to let Rio around her son.</p><p>Agatha reads her question correctly and puts a finger under her chin, scratching lightly. “You’ll be on your best behavior.”</p><p>A little shiver runs through her and all she can do is nod.</p><p>“Say it,” Agatha demands, and the shiver escalates.</p><p>“I’ll be on my best behavior,” Rio says. Obedient as always. Because she can’t say no to Agatha. She doesn’t want to say no.</p><p>Agatha makes her feel things she never even knew existed, let alone hoped to be able to feel. Safe, for one. Which is a mindfuck, really. She’s never felt safe in her life. Special, for another. She’s always felt important in her social circle, but never, ever special.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha purrs, and Rio’s thighs clench to stem the wave of arousal at those words. She doesn’t think she’d ever get tired of hearing them. Not from Agatha.</p><p>When she doesn’t respond, Agatha raises an eyebrow.</p><p>“What do you say?”</p><p>Nooo, she always forgets. “Thank you,” she says in a rush of air.</p><p>“Mhm,” Agatha says, clearly unimpressed.</p><p>Rio wants her to be impressed. She wants it so badly. Nothing else matters in that moment, actually. “Thank you for calling me a good girl when we both know I’m so bad,” she whispers. “I’m so sorry I forgot to say it until you reminded me. You shouldn’t have to remind me.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitches. There’s a split second delay, and then delicious words reach Rio’s ears. “No, I shouldn’t. But I always do, don’t I? You can’t even remember to say thank you when I so generously give you a compliment.”</p><p>The hitched breath and delay tells Rio Agatha is impressed. And that makes her feel… calm, for some reason. Accomplished. But not smug.</p><p>The calm vanishes when she thinks about dinner and games again. “What about Valentina?” she says, so quiet she barely hears herself.</p><p>If the abrupt one-eighty throws Agatha off, she doesn’t show it. “I think you should let her talk first if she wants to speak to you, otherwise don’t bother her.”</p><p>Rio nods and curls into the protective embrace, listening to Agatha’s heartbeat. “Can we stay like this longer?”</p><p>Agatha’s hand starts stroking through her hair, and it’s absolute bliss. “As long as you want.”</p>

<p>Agatha’s not gonna lie, she’s nervous. “Don’t make a face when you sit down for dinner,” she says as she starts the car.</p><p>“It hurts,” Rio says, and it’s the first time she’s really acknowledged that, and Agatha feels both turned on and guilty about it all at once.</p><p>They had laid on the sofa for hours, Agatha just holding Rio, and it felt so domestic and comfortable that it was a little bit scary. Because she could imagine herself holding Rio like that every day of her life.</p><p>“I know, but… just be careful when you sit for dinner so the kids don’t notice, okay?”</p><p>Rio buckles her seatbelt and makes a face, but nods. “Yeah, fine. I got it. Hide the evidence of your descent into sadism.”</p><p>Agatha is about to shift into drive but stops and stares. Rio must be sobering up if she’s throwing sarcasm that’s actually funny. “Ouch.”</p><p>Rio eyes her sideways. “I believe that’s my line.”</p><p>Agatha snorts out a laugh and puts the car in gear, pulling out of the driveway. “Good one. You must be getting sober.”</p><p>“Unfortunately,” Rio mutters, putting her feet up against the glove box.</p><p>Agatha reaches over and slaps her leg. “Get your feet off my glove box. Jesus.”</p><p>Rio drops her feet and the clunky heels of her boots thud against the floor of the car. “Dictator.”</p><p>Agatha wheezes a little and takes a right at the corner. “Dick. Period.”</p><p>Rio lets out an airy laugh and Agatha almost crashes the car.</p><p>“What the hell?”</p><p>“Sorry. I just… that’s the first time I’ve heard your real laugh.”</p><p>“And it’ll be the last if you’re going to swerve over the median and kill us.”</p><p>Agatha puts her eyes strictly on the road, her face heating up. “Right.”</p><p>--</p><p>The rest of the drive is uneventful, and her nerves kick into high gear as she parks in her driveway and shuts off the car. She’d already spoken to Nicky on the phone about Rio coming over for the evening, and then had him put Vee on so she could talk to her and tell her she didn’t have to interact with her aunt at all if she didn’t want to. Vee’s response had been that she didn’t give a shit one way or the other. Agatha didn’t blame her and told her that was absolutely understandable.</p><p>Now, she’s second guessing herself. This is a bad idea. The worst idea ever, probably. But she wants Rio in her life. There’s no denying that anymore. The selfish, entitled, high-off-her-face asshole was only what Rio presented to the world. At first, Agatha had doubted there was anything else underneath, but she’d been so, so wrong. There’s everything underneath. It’s just buried so deep Rio doesn’t know where to find it.</p><p>“Best behavior, right?” she double-triple-quadruple checks before she opens the driver’s door.</p><p>“Maybe you should give me a list of phrases I’m allowed to say,” Rio deadpans. “You can rank them in order of how many times I should say each one.”</p><p>Agatha flushes again. “Point taken.”</p><p>Rio flips her off with a goofy expression and gets out of the car, practically skipping up to the door.</p><p>Agatha shakes her head and follows, preparing for hell on earth but hoping for at least something above ground.</p><p>They get inside and Agatha introduces Rio and Nicky, and Rio gives an awkward nod with her hands shoved in the pockets of her five-thousand-dollar slacks.</p><p>“Hi,” Nicky says, much less awkward, but not overly friendly either. Agatha knows he’s still upset over how Rio has treated his friend.</p><p>“Hi,” Rio says, and her voice is kind of a grating bark, but Agatha doesn’t think she means it to be. She thinks Rio’s just as nervous as anyone else.</p><p>“Where’s Vee?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“In my room. She said she’s not coming out until dinner’s ready.”</p><p>“Fair enough,” Agatha says with a nod. “How long’s left on the timer?” She had asked Nicky to put a frozen lasagna in the oven about an hour ago.</p><p>“I don’t know, like five minutes probably,” he says with a shrug.</p><p>Agatha nods and heads to the kitchen, where the timer on the stove says five minutes and fifteen seconds. “Nice guess,” she calls back out to Nicky. “Tell Vee it’ll be ready in twenty minutes. That’ll give it a few minutes to cool.”</p><p>“Kay,” Nicky says, and she hears his footsteps receding down the hall. And she hears Rio’s footsteps approaching the kitchen.</p><p>When Rio appears in the doorway, Agatha jumps up to sit on the counter and looks at her with a grin. “Set the table for me, baby.”</p><p>Rio looks like a deer in headlights. “Huh?”</p><p>“Set the table.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flush pink. “I don’t know how to do that.”</p><p>“Well… what will we need to put the lasagna on?”</p><p>Rio takes a tentative step into the kitchen. “Plates…”</p><p>“And how many of us are here?”</p><p>“Four…”</p><p>“So find four plates and put one on the table in front of each chair.”</p><p>“Where are the plates?”</p><p>“Look around.”</p><p>Rio looks a bit dazed as she wanders over to the cabinets and opens them one at a time until she finds plates. She counts out four and takes them to the table, and Agatha swings her legs as she watches.</p><p>“Very good,” Agatha says. “What else will we need?”</p><p>“Forks. And maybe knives.”</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>Rio opens drawers until she finds the flatware, and carries four forks and four knives to the table. She sets one of each on one of the plates and Agatha tuts at her.</p><p>“Think. How are we getting the lasagna on a plate that’s got flatware in the middle of it?”</p><p>Rio looks at her, eyes swirling, and turns back to move the fork and the knife onto the table next to the plate.</p><p>“There you go.”</p><p>She does the same for the rest of the flatware, and looks at Agatha again. “Is that it?”</p><p>“Do you think that’s it?”</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>Agatha shakes a finger at her. “Lasagna is messy. Are you going to wipe your hands on those pretty clothes?”</p><p>Rio’s breath catches and she looks around until she sees the paper towel holder next to the sink.</p><p>The timer goes off and Agatha leans over and stretches to reach the dial on the stove and turns it off. “Open the oven to let the heat out before you take the paper towels over,” she says just as Rio rips off a fourth one from the roll.</p><p>Rio pulls open the oven door and moves out of the way of the blast of heat, then puts a paper towel next to each plate and surveys the layout. She seems to not like it, because she goes around and folds each paper towel in half, and Agatha feels some type of way about that.</p><p>“Okay, done.”</p><p>Agatha licks her lips. “I suppose none of us are going to get thirsty.”</p><p>She doesn’t miss the way Rio leans on the table for support. Agatha’s hitting her right in the degradation kink, as mild as this is.</p><p>After steadying herself, Rio goes back to the cabinets and finds four glasses, and Agatha doesn’t comment on the fact that they’re wine glasses until Rio sets them all out. “I’m not sure what kind of mother you think I am, but Nicholas is sixteen years old and he won’t be drinking any wine tonight.”</p><p>Rio makes a little noise and her jaw drops, and she collects the wine glasses, and for a split second Agatha thinks Rio’s going to throw them at her, but she doesn’t. She just puts them back in the cabinet and keeps searching until she comes up with four plastic cups, and she shows them to Agatha for approval.</p><p>“Those will be fine.”</p><p>Once Rio sets out the cups, Agatha hops down from the counter and gets on an oven mitt to take the lasagna out. She sets it on the stovetop and shuts the oven, then grabs a knife and cuts it so it’ll cool faster.</p><p>After putting away the oven mitt and closing the drawer, she turns to Rio, who’s still standing by the table. “Come here.”</p><p>Rio walks over immediately.</p><p>Agatha will never get tired of that. She swipes a thumb over Rio’s bottom lip and withdraws before the girl can suck it into her mouth. “Thank you for setting the table.”</p><p>Rio nods slowly.</p><p>“Go sit down, the kids will be out soon.”</p><p>“Which chair should I sit in?” Rio asks quietly, and Agatha shivers.</p><p>She guides Rio to the table with a hand on her lower back and nods at the chair closest to the windows.</p><p>Rio sits carefully, and she does a good job of keeping her discomfort off her face even though the kids haven’t come in yet.</p><p>Agatha gives her hair a little tug and kisses the top of her head, then goes to start serving the lasagna.</p><p>The kids wander out a few minutes later, just as Agatha’s sliding the last piece of lasagna onto the last plate. “Eat up,” she announces, hoping to forestall any awkwardness.</p><p>Vee drags her chair to the other end of the table so she’s not near Rio, dragging her plate and silverware with her, then grabs her cup and paper towel last. Nicky sits in the chair at the head of the table, next to Vee, and Agatha sits on the other side, to Rio’s left, which would be across from Vee if she hadn’t moved.</p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything about Vee moving away from her, but Agatha can tell it bothers her just from learning Rio’s microexpressions in the short time they’ve known each other.</p><p>“Oops, I forgot drinks,” she says.</p><p>“I’ll get them,” Vee says, and stands sharply, sending her chair careening back into the wall.</p><p>Agatha jumps a little at the unexpected outburst, but lets Vee express herself without comment.</p><p>Vee stalks to the refrigerator, but stalks back without opening it. “She’s not even gonna say she’s sorry?” she shouts at Agatha.</p><p>“I’m sorry!” Rio stutters. “Agatha said to let you speak first!”</p><p>Vee loses some of her vitriol at that and goes to grab a bottle of soda from the fridge, handing it to Agatha before she drags her chair close enough to sit back down.</p><p>“I told Rio to let you take the lead if you wanted to talk,” Agatha says, pouring soda into everyone’s cups and putting the cap back on. “I didn’t want you to feel pressured.”</p><p>“Well how I <em>feel</em> is that her ass shouldn’t even <em>be</em> here,” Vee snaps. “But life’s a bitch, isn’t it?”</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio says, staring at her plate. “It’s complicated, but I shouldn’t have taken it out on you.”</p><p>“Is that you talking or your puppet master?” Valentina snarls.</p><p>“Vee,” Agatha warns.</p><p>“No fuck you, and fuck this dinner!” Valentina screams, and she shoves her chair back again and storms out of the house.</p><p>Agatha gets up to go after her but Nicky’s up faster, heading for the door. “I got it, mom. We’ll be back.”</p><p>“Just take me home,” Rio says when they’re alone.</p><p>A flare of anger rises up. “No. You don’t get to give up after one try,” she says. “You have to work harder than that.”</p><p>“But she hates me. I even said sorry twice…”</p><p>“And she should hate you,” Agatha says sternly. “She has no reason not to hate you. But you’re not giving up, Rio. You’re going to fight for her.”</p><p>Rio pushes the lasagna around on her plate with her fork and doesn’t respond.</p><p>Agatha slams her hands down on the table and Rio startles, looking up with wide eyes.</p><p>“I said you’re going to fight for her. That means you don’t run away, understand? You stay even when it’s uncomfortable.”</p><p>“Okay,” Rio says quickly, on the heels of Agatha’s last word.</p><p>“Now eat your dinner.”</p><p>Rio cuts off a piece and puts it in her mouth, and Agatha watches her chew and swallow.</p><p>They’re both halfway done by the time Nicky and Valentina come back through the door, and Agatha feels Rio tense even from two feet away.</p><p>“She didn’t tell me to apologize,” Rio says in a rush.</p><p>Vee sits hard and starts shoveling in her food. “Fine,” she says with a mouthful. “Done talking about it.”</p><p>Rio offers Nicky a weak smile and starts pushing her food around again, staring at her plate.</p><p>Agatha goes back to eating, keeping one eye on Rio and one on Vee with her peripheral vision, and she can see Rio building up to something, but she has no idea what, and it looks like it’s becoming physically painful to hold back whatever she’s about to say, and then Rio’s words come tumbling out unchecked.</p><p>“Did your father ever do anything weird to you?” she blurts loudly, dropping her fork and staring across the table at Vee.</p><p>Oh god. Of all the things…</p><p>“No?” Valentina says, shoving her plate away from her. “What do you mean did he ever do anything weird to me?”</p><p>Agatha moves into damage control mode before this pops off like a powder keg. “Rio and Nicky, please clear the table when you’re finished. Vee, I need to speak to you, right now please, alone.”</p><p>“Uh, no,” Valentina says. “What the fuck does that mean?” she demands of Rio.</p><p>“Please, Valentina,” Agatha says desperately.</p><p>Vee seems to realize how serious it is, because she relents and walks away from the table, toward Nicky’s bedroom.</p><p>“Rio, that’s not the way to tell her,” she says gently. She knows Rio didn’t mean to cause a problem, but Agatha can’t let them have that conversation with how Vee still feels about her aunt. It would be a fucking disaster.</p><p>She follows Vee into Nicky’s room and shuts the door behind them.</p><p>“What?” Valentina snaps. “What’s so fucking important?”</p><p>Agatha takes a calming breath. “There are some things… some… there are things that happened to your aunt that are going to be hard for you to hear.”</p><p>“I doubt that.”</p><p>Agatha sits on the bed and waits until Vee sits beside her. “Trust me,” she says, shaking her head. “You do still trust me, don’t you?”</p><p>“It feels like you’re suddenly taking her side.”</p><p>“I’m sorry it feels like that, and I know my attitude toward her has changed over the past few days, but I’ve learned some things that… explain her behavior, for lack of a better way to put it. And she understands the awful mistakes she made with you. She’s going to try to stop doing drugs. I know none of this makes up for how she’s treated you, Vee, and you don’t ever have to go back there if you don’t want to, you can always stay here with me and Nicky, but can you give her one tiny chance? If she blows it, I’ll never ask it of you again.”</p><p>Vee’s eyes are filled with tears and Agatha pulls her into a hug.</p><p>“What did she mean about my dad?” Vee asks after a minute, and Agatha can hear the wariness in her voice. Vee’s not stupid, she’s made a connection between what Rio said and what Agatha just told her.</p><p>“I actually want you to hear that from her if you hear it at all, I just wanted to talk to you first. Because if you’re not willing to give her a chance, I’m not going to let her have that conversation with you. It’s your call.”</p><p>“Will you stay though? I don’t want to talk to her alone…”</p><p>“Yes, of course,” Agatha says, giving her an extra squeeze. She lets go and opens the door. “Rio, can you come in here? Nicky, can you set up a game for us all to play please?”</p><p>“Sure mom. Is Vee okay?”</p><p>“I’m fine, lover boy!” Vee calls out to him.</p><p>“Vee!” he shouts in the same tone he uses when Agatha embarrasses him.</p><p>Rio appears a minute later, hands shoved into her pockets, lower lip settled firmly between her teeth.</p><p>Agatha ushers her in and shuts the door. “She’s ready to hear what you have to say now,” she says. “I didn’t tell her what happened, I just told her some things would be hard to hear.”</p><p>Rio looks like she’s going to be sick, but she nods and sits at the opposite end of the bed than Vee. “My brother—your—your dad,” she starts, taking her hands out of her pockets and picking at Nicky’s comforter. “When I was five and he was sixteen, our parents died.”</p><p>“He told me that was your fault.”</p><p>Rio seems to have expected that. “He blamed me. But it wasn’t my fault, I swear it wasn’t.”</p><p>“Whose fault was it? What happened to them? He said you were screaming and kicking the back of your dad’s seat and made him get in an accident.”</p><p>Rio stares at her hands and shakes her head. “That—that’s not true.”</p><p>Agatha wants so badly to jump in and save them both from this horrible reality, but she forces herself to stay quiet, to just be a comforting presence for them both and let them talk to each other.</p><p>“Well what really happened then?”</p><p>“My father abused me and went to prison when I told my teacher about it. He got killed in prison and then my mother killed herself.”</p><p>Valentina’s eyes go wide as saucers and her jaw drops, tears dripping down her cheeks. “What?” She looks at Agatha. “Is that true?”</p><p>“That’s what Rio says happened, and I believe her,” Agatha says, instead of just answering yes. “I’m sure if you need proof there would be prison records.”</p><p>Vee looks back to Rio. “Why did he lie to me about it?”</p><p>“Because he—” Rio chokes on a sob and tugs Nicky’s comforter up around herself like a shield. “He blamed me. He said I should’ve kept my mouth shut and he—he tortured me for it. He kept me in a cage and—”</p><p>“Stop,” Vee begs, and runs to Agatha, throwing her arms around her. “It’s not true, it can’t be true!”</p><p>“I’m so sorry, honey,” Agatha says, rocking with her. “I’m so, so sorry.”</p><p>Vee rips herself away almost immediately and spins on Rio, shouting at her. “You’re lying!”</p><p>But it’s obvious by Rio’s body language that she’s not.</p><p>And Vee doesn’t really think she is. It’s just too much for a seventeen-year-old to process without trying to believe it isn’t true. That someone she loved could have been such a monster. That she believed a lie for her whole life. It breaks Agatha’s heart, for both of them.</p><p>“You’re not lying,” Vee finally says, and to Agatha’s astonishment, she throws her arms around Rio.</p><p>Rio looks terrified, staring at Agatha for help, so Agatha makes a gesture to encourage her to hug back, and Rio drops the blanket, putting her arms around Valentina.</p><p>“Is that why you don’t want me?” she cries.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio whispers. “I know that’s not fair. I’m trying though, I really am. I know you’re not him. I—I—I—I—I just don’t know how to do this.”</p><p>“I hate him, I fucking hate him!” Valentina sobs. “He lied to me my whole life! How could he do that to his baby sister? How could he seem so normal? I’m sorry Aunt Rio I’m so sorry he hurt you…”</p><p>Agatha can see Rio struggling to breathe right, and she goes to sit next to both of them, laying a hand on Rio’s lower back to ground her. “Breathe,” she says softly, and Rio does.</p><p>Vee turns toward the door and shouts through it. “NICKY! GROUP HUG!”</p><p>Agatha laughs and slides the hand on Rio’s back further over to wrap around her side and pull her close just as Nicky opens the door and steps in with a raised eyebrow.</p><p>“What?” he asks, surveying the scene. “What the heck is happening?”</p><p>“She told you,” Agatha says, waving him over with her free hand. “Group hug.”</p><p>Nicky looks them all over again, then shrugs and jumps in.</p><p>Rio is still completely rigid, so Agatha starts rubbing her side, keeping her pulled close, until she starts to melt a little. Agatha imagines she’s never really been hugged, especially not by family. Agatha’s held her, but that’s different. This has to be nerve wracking after decades of isolation.</p><p>“You can kiss her. We already know you’re fucking,” Vee says with a sigh after watching Agatha try to resist comforting Rio more intimately.</p><p>“What?” Agatha shrieks.</p><p>“Please. How the hell else would she have ended up with your tie? And why else would she have worn it to my school the next day? Why would her behavior suddenly change? She suddenly tries to stop using? Give me a fucking break.”</p><p>Agatha’s floundering and she’s not used to it. Not used to having no words. And Rio’s gone completely rigid again.</p><p>“You thirteenth-stepped that shit,” Vee continues. “We’ll be getting the game ready while <em>you</em> pick your jaw up off the floor and <em>you</em> thaw out,” she says to Agatha and Rio respectively, then flounces out of the room dragging Nicky behind her.</p><p>Agatha pulls Rio onto her lap, going back into damage control mode. “It’s okay,” she soothes. “You’re okay.” She rubs up and down the tense muscles of Rio’s back, kissing the top of her head over and over.</p><p>Rio takes in a deep, gasping breath, and then the dam breaks. She falls apart in Agatha’s arms.</p>

<p>She doesn’t know how long she cries, only that Agatha never lets go. She’s never felt so safe. Never felt cared for like this. She would spend the rest of her life touching Agatha in some way if she could.</p><p>When the tears are spent and her adrenaline drained, she feels hollow enough to share more. Just with Agatha. “He tied plastic bags around my mouth so I had to breathe really slowly to keep the plastic away from my nose or I couldn’t breathe at all,” she says, and she knows her voice is flat but that’s the only way she can talk about it. “He shackled my hands so I couldn’t take it off.”</p><p>She feels Agatha tense underneath her, but she knows it’s okay. Agatha has proved that she can handle it.</p><p>“One time I managed to cut a hole in it by catching the plastic on the end of one of the bars. That was the only time he ever hit me. The rest of the time he ignored me. Except when he would have his friends come over, they’d toss things into the cage. One of them put a spider in, and I couldn’t help screaming, even though I’d learned by then to be quiet and hadn’t had anything over my mouth in months. When he came toward me I begged and promised to shut up, and he laughed and rattled the cage but left me alone.”</p><p>Agatha’s arms tighten around her and when she looks up, Agatha’s crying.</p><p>“Should I stop?” she whispers.</p><p>“No,” Agatha whispers back. “My heart is breaking but I want you to share with me.”</p><p>Rio nods and tucks her head back under Agatha’s chin. “He let me out twice a day to go to the bathroom on a chain. He fed me twice a day too, otherwise I was alone in the basement. I don’t understand why he didn’t just kill me, and now I’ll never know.”</p><p>Agatha gasps and her fingers dig in to Rio’s back. “I’m glad he didn’t kill you,” she says, and Rio hasn’t heard her voice shake like that before. “I’m also glad he’s dead.”</p><p>Rio blinks, trying to process that last part. It’s a foreign sensation, to have someone upset on her behalf instead of being upset at her. “I’m glad he’s dead too, but… why would he give me his daughter? Was it to torture me even though he’s gone?”</p><p>“I don’t know, but I think it’s up to you whether you let him be in charge of your relationship with Valentina. She doesn’t have to represent him. And what better way to say fuck you to a disgusting piece of shit than to defy any and all expectations of failure?”</p><p>Rio hadn’t considered that. Mostly because she hadn’t considered anything but her life being interrupted. “Do you think someday I won’t think about him when I look at her?”</p><p>Probably not, she guesses.</p><p>“Yeah, I think someday you’ll see her for the amazing person she is and not where she came from.”</p><p>Agatha’s answer sparks a tiny ember of hope in her chest, because maybe that is possible. “Really?”</p><p>“Really. The more you get to know her, the easier it’s going to be to see her only for who she is.”</p><p>Rio turns around so she’s straddling Agatha’s lap and wraps her arms around Agatha’s neck, pressing close. “Thank you,” she whispers. “For everything.”</p><p>Agatha’s hand comes up to tuck some hair behind Rio’s ear and it feels so sweet and soft and familiar. “You’re such a good girl, Rio,” she says, pressing her lips to Rio’s head.</p><p>Rio melts at the praise, a shiver lighting through her, and as reluctant as she is to move, she figures the kids have kind of waited long enough. “I hope it’s a game I know how to play…”</p><p>“What games do you know how to play?” Agatha asks, setting Rio carefully on her feet.</p><p>“I played Sorry once at a party, but I don’t remember the rules.”</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>“That’s it.”</p><p>“So you hope it’s a game you know how to play that doesn’t exist?”</p><p>Rio bites her lip and nods. “Well, yeah. I guess.”</p><p>“Whatever they picked, I’ll teach you how to play,” Agatha promises.</p><p>“Like you taught me to set the table?” Rio says cheekily.</p><p>“No. No humiliation in front of the kids.”</p><p>“I was joking.”</p><p>“Were you?”</p><p>“…mostly.”</p><p>“Get your ass out there.”</p><p>--</p><p>“Monopoly?” Agatha says with a groan. “Nicky, are you trying to avoid bedtime?”</p><p>“We can play on a time limit,” Nicky says. “Vee’s the manipulator, not me. I just like this game.”</p><p>“I’m no such thing,” Valentina says, tossing her hair at him, and her ponytail whips him in the face.</p><p>“Ow! What the heck!”</p><p>“Oops.”</p><p>Rio watches and listens to the exchange from just outside the group, a few feet away, playing with her hands. She doesn’t know where to sit or what to say.</p><p>Nicky looks over at her and she has a feeling he’s about to say something embarrassing.</p><p>She’s not wrong.</p><p>“Come on Rio, we all know you want to sit on mom’s lap…”</p><p>“Nicholas!” Agatha barks, eyes wide.</p><p>Rio’s face burns and she shuffles over to sit carefully on the sofa next to Agatha. Not on her lap.</p><p>“Yeah, Agatha, where’s your tie?” Vee joins in the teasing.</p><p>Rio’s about to get up and run, figuring Agatha’s going to be angry and somehow blame her for not being discreet enough to hide their dynamic from the kids.</p><p>“Shut the hell up, both of you,” Agatha snaps, and Rio starts to stand up, but then Agatha picks up the dice and throws them at Nicky. “Youngest idiot goes first.”</p><p>“I’m not an idiot, so who’s going first?” Nicky says, looking around as Rio lowers herself back down the inch she’d gotten between her ass and the sofa when she’d planned to run.</p><p>Agatha’s not mad. Not at the kids, and not at Rio. She lets out a breath she didn’t know she was holding in. Every experience with this woman makes her feel more and more comfortable. Safe. Protected. And Nicky wasn’t wrong either… she does want to sit on Agatha’s lap. But that’s not appropriate, even she knows that.</p><p>She wants contact though. Needs it. So she scoots just close enough for their knees to touch. Her anxiety is instantly calmed and she tries to relax and pay attention to the game.</p><p>She listens to the others when they try to explain it, but her hands are starting to sweat and her legs are getting jittery. She’s only had one line since the… incident… and her body is finally protesting.</p><p>“You’re having withdrawals,” Vee says as she rolls the dice and moves her marker.</p><p>“How—” Rio starts but Vee keeps talking.</p><p>“Agatha said you’re trying to quit drugs, and look at your hands, they’re like a live wire.”</p><p>Rio looks down, and her hands are as jittery as her legs. She tries to stop it by pressing her hands down onto her knees, but all that does is make the vibrations shoot up her arms. The sensation is nauseating.</p><p>She tries to ignore it because she doesn’t want to ruin the first thing she’s ever done with Valentina. “I’m fine,” she says. “Let—let’s just play…”</p><p>“You’re not fine, you’re gonna hurl all over the game in a minute,” Valentina says, shaking her head. “I’m not gonna buy properties covered in vomit so… we can play later.”</p><p>“I’m—I won’t,” Rio promises even though her stomach is roiling.</p><p>Vee looks past her at Agatha. “I’d say you got about thirty seconds max to get her to the bathroom,” she says.</p><p>“But—”</p><p>“Come on,” Agatha says, pulling her to her feet and guiding her toward the bathroom with a hand on her lower back.</p><p>And Vee was right, because the second she gets into the bathroom, her knees hit the floor and dinner comes right back up.</p><p>Agatha holds her hair and rubs her back, and it’s the only thing keeping Rio from losing her fucking mind.</p>

<p>Agatha has no idea what to do other than make sure Rio doesn’t vomit on her hair and make sure she doesn’t feel alone.</p><p>When the vomiting is down to dry heaves, she thinks it’s just Rio’s body’s instinct now to keep going even when there’s nothing left.</p><p>She can feel the sweat through Rio’s blouse as she rubs her back, and the shaking is getting worse.</p><p>“Should I take you home?” she asks when Rio finally stops heaving.</p><p>“No,” Rio says. “I’m done. I want out. I’ll go to a medical detox facility and get it over with.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart starts racing and her own hands go clammy. “Are you sure?” She can’t think of anything she wants more than Rio to just be done with the drugs, but Rio had originally said she wanted to wean down, and Agatha doesn’t want her to feel pressured to change her mind. She’s already come so far. “Because you said—”</p><p>“I’m sure,” Rio interrupts. “I want to be able to play games.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest swells up and she brushes sweaty hair back from Rio’s forehead. “I want that too,” she says, and Jesus, Rio looks awful. Like she’ll collapse any second.</p><p>She reaches into her slacks for her phone, sends a message, and a few seconds later puts it away. “My driver’s coming to get me. I told him to arrange a bed for  me.”</p><p>“When do you think it’ll be ready?”</p><p>Rio pokes her tongue into her cheek. “I pay extra for promptness.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes and snorts out a slightly derogatory laugh. “Right.”</p><p>“They might not let me have my phone for the first few days,” Rio says, chewing her bottom lip as they sit on the bathroom floor looking at each other.</p><p>“Will I be able to call and talk to you on your room phone then?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I’ve never actually gone to detox or rehab.”</p><p>“Okay well just text me as soon as you can, as soon as they give the phone back,” Agatha says, feeling like she’s about to part with one of her kidneys.</p><p>Rio nods and starts to get up, so Agatha jumps up to help her, and by the time they get to the living room and tell Vee and Nicky what’s going to happen, Rio’s driver is knocking on the door.</p><p>Agatha has tears in her eyes as she says goodbye and gives Rio the longest hug of her life, and when Rio is halfway to the car she thinks of something and shouts after her. “Rio, wait!”</p><p>Rio turns, and Agatha holds up a finger.</p><p>“Wait for one second,” she says, and darts into her bedroom, frantically searching for the pants she was wearing when she last shoved her tie in the pockets. She finds them in the laundry and grabs the tie, and runs back to the front door, praying Rio’s still there, and she is, and Agatha’s crying as she meets her outside and presses the tie into her hands. “Take this with you…”</p><p>Rio gasps, looking up at her, eyes blown. “Really? I can?”</p><p>Agatha nods and hugs her one more time. “Okay go before I can’t handle it…”</p><p>Rio clutches the tie to her chest and turns around, and Agatha can see how dazed she is even from behind as she gets in the car, and a moment later she’s gone.</p><p>Agatha wipes her eyes and takes a deep breath and tries to put on a neutral face for the kids, but when she turns around after shutting and locking the front door, they’re both staring at her.</p><p>“You love my aunt,” Valentina says in awe.</p><p>“What? No,” Agatha protests, trying to shake it off. “We’ve only known each other a few weeks.”</p><p>“You’re deadass crying because she’s going to detox,” Valentina says.</p><p>“I’m—it’s an emotional thing,” Agatha says, waving a hand dismissively.</p><p>“It’s really not,” Vee insists.</p><p>“It’s okay mom,” Nicky says, giving her a hug. “You haven’t dated in a long time. It makes sense you’d fall kind of fast.”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha says, hugging Nicky back but then heading for her bedroom. “Both of you… cease and desist. I’ll be out in a little bit, okay?”</p><p>She shuts her bedroom door and leans against it, tears building up again, and hears the telltale sounds of the PS5 starting up, grateful for that because the kids will have something to distract them for a while.</p><p>She climbs into bed and pulls the blankets up around her, and wishes she would have asked Rio to leave something. But it all happened so fast she barely had time to think of the tie, let alone anything else.</p><p>It’s been a long time since she just laid in bed and cried, so maybe she’s due.</p><p>--</p><p>She doesn’t hear from Rio the next day, so she assumes Rio’s cell phone was indeed taken, and she’d forgotten to ask the name of the facility so she can’t even call to check on her.</p><p>She’s distracted at work and makes several mistakes, but she doesn’t usually, so her boss just points them out and lets her fix them without issue.</p><p>--</p><p>She finally gets a text on Saturday morning, which is three days after Rio had left.</p><p><strong>R: got my phone</strong></p><p>Her heart kickstarts a bass beat and she sits up straighter on the sofa, staring at the screen. What should she even say? Probably ask how Rio is, that should be the first thing she says, right?</p><p><strong>A: I miss you.</strong></p><p>She sends it before her brain catches up with her fingers and cringes. Nice, Harkness.</p><p><strong>R: miss u 2</strong></p><p>She really hopes that the longer Rio is sober, the more words she’ll learn to type out on her phone.</p><p><strong>A: How are you doing? And feeling? Are you okay?</strong></p><p><strong>R: feel like trash but ok. lots of puking lots of irritation lots of insomnia</strong></p><p>Agatha wants to wave a magic wand and make her better.</p><p><strong>A: You didn’t puke on the tie, did you? </strong><strong>😉</strong></p><p><strong>R: lol no ty 4 ur concern</strong></p><p>Agatha snickers and debates sending what she wants to say next, then ultimately decides to go for it.</p><p><strong>A: Have you used it for anything?</strong></p><p>The three dots that say Rio’s typing appear on the screen for a long time. She’s either writing a novel or she’s typing and deleting.</p><p><strong>R: did u want me 2 use it 4 sthg</strong></p><p>That response hits her right in the dom brain and she blows out a breath before responding.</p><p><strong>A: Only if you feel well enough to enjoy it. Do you?</strong></p><p>The dots are there for a long time again.</p><p><strong>R: i wldnt say no 2 u agatha if u tell me to use it i will</strong></p><p>Agatha shakes her head, out of instinct since she knows Rio can’t actually see her do it.</p><p><strong>A: How about this. You tell me when you DO feel well enough to use it.</strong></p><p>Rio’s answer comes quick this time.</p><p><strong>R: ok i will</strong></p><p><strong>A: When can I come see you?</strong></p><p><strong>R: idk</strong></p><p>Agatha sits frowning at the phone for a minute. She doesn’t like not knowing when she’ll get to visit Rio.</p><p><strong>A: When do you move from detox to rehab?</strong></p><p><strong>R: tmrw</strong></p><p><strong>A: Is it another facility or just another part of the one you’re in?</strong></p><p><strong>R: anthr part of 1 im in</strong></p><p><strong>A: What’s the name of it by the way? I forgot to ask and I would’ve called to check on you every day.</strong></p><p><strong>R: sthg abt a vineyard</strong></p><p><strong>A: Rio.</strong></p><p><strong>R: ill ask</strong></p><p>Agatha snorts and waits for Rio to go ask and come back with an answer.</p><p><strong>R: lovelace vineyard</strong></p><p><strong>A: Thank you. Good girl.</strong></p><p><strong>R: omg ur gna kill me</strong></p><p><em>Your texting is gonna kill me</em>, Agatha thinks.</p><p><strong>A: I wish I could put my arms around you.</strong></p><p>When did she get so fucking sappy? This is embarrassing.</p><p><strong>R: me 2 ok its dinner I g2g</strong></p><p><strong>A: Have a good dinner. Text me whenever.</strong></p><p>Rio sends a kiss emoji and Agatha sends one back.</p><p>--</p><p>She’s halfway through dinner with the kids when her phone beeps, and when she opens the message from Rio she spits pork chop all over the table.</p><p>It’s an upskirt photo and Rio’s not wearing any underwear.</p><p>“Jesus fucking Christ,” she splutters, coughing until she dislodges a near-aspirated piece of meat.</p><p>“Mom, are you okay?” Nicky asks, eyes wide, jumping up with the intent to help her somehow.</p><p>“I’m fine, I’m fine, stay there,” she coughs, holding out a hand to keep him at the other end of the table.</p><p>“What happened?” he asks, sitting back down but not taking his eyes off her.</p><p>She doesn’t like the expression on Vee’s face. “Auntie Rio sent her nudes,” she says with a smirk.</p><p>Agatha’s face is on fire. “Stop, she didn’t,” she lies, but it’s pathetic and unconvincing.</p><p>Nicky folds his arms over his chest. “Lying is wrong, mom. Just say you’re not gonna talk about it with us.”</p><p>“Yeah, Agatha,” Vee drawls, much too gleeful and smug for Agatha’s liking. “Just tell us you’re not gonna discuss the pu—”</p><p>“VEE!” Agatha shrieks, the sound reminiscent of a Scooby Doo villain.</p><p>Nicky’s face is bright red now and he elbows Valentina. “That’s my <em>mom</em>,” he groans. “Stop.”</p><p>Vee holds up her hands in surrender. “I’m done, I’m done.”</p><p>Agatha shoves her phone into her pants pocket as far down as it will go and forcefully spears another piece of pork chop. She chews louder than necessary, and everything is silent except for the sound of her teeth clashing together.</p><p>Nicky and Vee aren’t eating, they’re just staring at her, and she sees something bubbling up in Valentina before it spills over, but there’s nothing she can do to stop it.</p><p>“You better answer her or she’s gonna think you didn’t like the pics!”</p><p>It comes bursting out of Valentina’s mouth and Agatha shoves her plate away from her and bolts from the table, locking herself in her bedroom.</p><p>She grabs her phone and stares at the photo, heart racing, and sends Rio a scathing text.</p><p><strong>A: I was at the dinner table with the kids!!!</strong></p><p>And then before Rio can get the wrong idea she quickly sends another.</p><p><strong>A: But goddamn your pussy looks amazing. Why aren’t you wearing underwear?</strong></p><p><strong>R: bc i wanted 2 send u the pic. sry 4 bad timing</strong></p><p><strong>A: Don’t apologize. How are you feeling?</strong></p><p><strong>R: better after eating dinner finally dont feel like im gna throw up</strong></p><p><strong>A: Are you allowed to make phone calls? Or just text?</strong></p><p><strong>R: i can have calls if im not 2 loud</strong></p><p><strong>A: Do you have your own room?</strong></p><p><strong>R: is that a real q of course i do i paid for it</strong></p><p><strong>A: Spoiled. Call me.</strong></p><p>Her phone rings and she answers immediately. “Hey.”</p><p>“Hi.” Rio sounds good. “I, um… I miss you.”</p><p>Agatha feels like a teenager with her first crush. “I miss you too.”</p><p>“Tomorrow I’ll ask when I’m allowed visitors. If you want to come I mean.”</p><p>“Of course I do,” Agatha says, finally walking away from her bedroom door and climbing onto the bed, propped up against her pillows. “So… what do you do all day there?”</p><p>“Sweat out toxins and go to therapy,” Rio says, and Agatha can just imagine the face she’s pulling.</p><p>“Wow, sounds like your idea of a great time,” Agatha laughs.</p><p>“You know me so well,” Rio says with her own little laugh, and Agatha loves the sound so fucking much. But then Rio stops laughing and says quietly, “you <em>do</em> know me so well. You know me better than anyone ever has.”</p><p>Emotion constricts Agatha’s throat and she swallows before offering just as quietly, “that’s their loss.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t say anything for a minute, and then her voice comes down the line full of hesitation. “Are you really going to drive all this way to visit me?”</p><p>“Yeah,” Agatha says. “As often as I’m allowed to. I mean… outside of my work hours. I can’t afford to call off anymore this month or I’d camp outside the rehab waiting for visiting hours.”</p><p>She obviously can’t see Rio, but she can feel the other woman gathering herself. “I’m sorry you called off at all. I’ll make up the difference in your paycheck, okay? I don’t want you struggling because of me.”</p><p>“I’m not taking your money, sugar mama,” Agatha teases, but Rio doesn’t laugh, so she falls serious. “Honestly, Rio. I’m not going to take your money. I’ll manage. I always do. I just won’t be able to call off again until next month.”</p><p>“I’m so sorry for—”</p><p>“Stop,” Agatha interrupts firmly. “Be a good girl for me Rio.”</p><p>Rio moans, quiet but loud at the same time. “Okay,” she says. “I’ll be a good girl.”</p><p>“Mm, thank you,” Agatha purrs.</p><p>“I have to go to group therapy before bed, which I hate so fucking much and would rather lay here talking to you instead, but it’s mandatory and even my money can’t get me out of it so I gotta go for now.”</p><p>“Being a good girl means talking at least a little in group therapy, okay?” Agatha says.</p><p>Rio whines softly but agrees. “I’ll tell them my name.”</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warns.</p><p>“Okay, okay, I’ll talk a little bit. But not very much. I’ve never told anyone anything before you. You’re the only person I trust.”</p><p>Agatha wants to hold her so bad. “Okay, I know you have to go, I’m not trying to make you late for therapy. I’m really glad you have your phone back. Call me tomorrow?”</p><p>“Call you tomorrow,” Rio says. “Night.”</p><p>“Good night.”</p>

<p>Therapy sucks. She focuses on her father’s abuse because it’s something she can’t remember. She only knows because her brother reminded her of it all the time, and then when she was old enough, she looked up the court case, because what if her brother had been lying? But he wasn’t. She’d read the transcripts related to the case, because as an involved party she was entitled to the records.</p><p>So she told the group about that, as if she remembered it, but she really wants to save her memories for when she’s back with Agatha.</p><p>Now she’s in bed, unable to sleep. She’s been tossing and turning for a good two hours, and she doesn’t want to disturb Agatha because it’s midnight and she doesn’t know if Agatha works weekends, and she’d forgotten to ask.</p><p>But the longer she lays there torturing herself trying to sleep, the more agitated she gets, and if she wasn’t in a locked facility she’d call Jed to bring her some blow. She could leave, but she’s come this far, she intends to stay the course. The cravings haven’t stopped, and she knows they’ll go on for weeks at a minimum. And after the initial recovery, there’s no guarantee she won’t have spontaneous cravings for the rest of her life. But <em>those</em>, she’s prepared to deal with by going to Agatha. Every time.</p><p><em>These</em>, the <em>constant</em> cravings, are making her skin crawl and her brain feel like it’s bleeding.</p><p>Finally she can’t take it. A text shouldn’t wake Agatha if she’s sleeping.</p><p><strong>R: i cant sleep</strong></p><p>She stares at her phone, and her heart jumps when she sees the three dots indicating Agatha is typing.</p><p><strong>A: What’s wrong, baby?</strong></p><p>Now her heart slams against her ribs double time. Agatha calling her baby is the single most thrilling thing she can imagine.</p><p><strong>R: cravings and im just so irritable and cant get cmfrtble my skins crawling I got cramps in my legs my minds racing and my head kinda hurts</strong></p><p><strong>A: Can you call me?</strong></p><p>Rio feels a warmth in her belly as she hits the call button, and it gets warmer when Agatha answers right away.</p><p>“Hey, baby.”</p><p>Rio shudders, pushing her tongue briefly between her teeth. “Hi. I’m sorry if I woke you up.”</p><p>“You didn’t.” Agatha sounds so kind. “I’m sorry you can’t sleep. Do you want to talk about it?”</p><p>“Not really much to talk about, I just… can’t settle,” Rio says.</p><p>There’s a pause on the other end and then Agatha says, “do you want to touch yourself for me?”</p><p>Rio’s breath hitches, a slow exhale sliding out against the phone. “Yes, please,” she says, the idea extremely appealing.</p><p>“What are you sleeping in?”</p><p>“A plain white t-shirt and plaid boxers. There wasn’t too many options since I didn’t bother to bring any of my own clothes.”</p><p>Agatha moans into her ear and Rio’s eyebrows shoot up.</p><p>“Send me a pic, I have to see that.”</p><p>Rio’s oddly nervous as she snaps a photo of herself in the clothes and sends it. Pussy shots? No problem. Fully clothed but in something she’d never normally wear? Nervous.</p><p>“Fuck me,” Agatha breathes through the line. “You look so hot.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks burn. “Th—thank you,” she stammers, looking down at herself and failing to see the appeal.</p><p>“I love love love your ultra-femme looks, but this soft butch look is doing it for me too,” Agatha rumbles, and Rio hears a rustling of fabric.</p><p>“What are you doing?” she chokes out. “You’re getting out of bed?” She prays the rustling is Agatha throwing off the sheets to get up because she doesn’t think she’ll survive if it’s anything <em>else</em>.</p><p>“I’m definitely not getting out of bed,” Agatha says, voice low and taunting in Rio’s ears.</p><p>“I’ll die,” she splutters. “I’ll fucking die.”</p><p>“That’s dramatic,” Agatha drawls. “But if you don’t want—”</p><p>“I do!” Rio interrupts in a desperate hiss.</p><p>“Don’t interrupt me,” Agatha says coolly.</p><p>Rio settles, flexing the hand not holding the phone and curling it into a fist, then flexing again. “Sorry, I’m sorry,” she says much more calmly.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha sounds unimpressed and Rio knows she’s about to pay for her transgression.</p><p>She’s right.</p><p>“If you want it, beg for it,” Agatha says like it’s the most casual thing in the world.</p><p>“Oh fuck,” Rio whines, rubbing her thighs together. “Please?”</p><p>A trill of laughter. “Please what, baby?”</p><p>God, that word. “Please let me hear you?”</p><p>“What do you want to hear, Rio?”</p><p>Rio’s practically fucking salivating at the thought of hearing Agatha touch herself. “I—I—I want to hear you touch yourself. Please. Please?”</p><p>Agatha’s never so much as hinted at touching herself before, or at letting Rio touch her. Every time she’s tried, even something as innocent as putting her hands on Agatha’s waist, she’s been told off. So this? This feels like a fucking gold medal in the hardest event of the Olympics.</p><p>“I’m taking off my pants,” Agatha tells her.</p><p>“Ahhh,” Rio sort of half squeaks, half shrieks. It’s a weird noise, indefinable really, but it makes Agatha chuckle so it must not’ve been that bad.</p><p>“Do you want to know what color my panties are?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says, eyes wide as she stares at the images in her mind.</p><p>“They’re black. With little purple crowns all over them. And they’re soft. Really soft. They make my finger feel at home running along the seams. So inviting…”</p><p>Rio short circuits, a whimper unfurling into the air of her otherwise quiet room.</p><p>“What do you think I should do next, Rio?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice is smooth as silk and dirty as a cheap strip club, she’s not fooling anyone. Rio stutters uselessly. “I—I—p—is—can you go un—under the seams?”</p><p>“Under the seams?” Agatha teases. “I mean I could…”</p><p>Rio’s going to lose her mind. “Ple—please?”</p><p>“Which seam? Around my left thigh, right thigh, or across my belly?”</p><p>Rio’s breathing is so harsh already she doesn’t know what to do with herself. She’s constantly moving her legs, squeezing her thighs together to try to relieve the pressure, but nothing makes a difference. “R—right thigh,” she pants out.</p><p>“Mmm,” Agatha hums. “I slipped one finger underneath and turned it over to run my fingertip up and down the seam from the inside.”</p><p>“Jesus fucking Christ,” Rio spirals, jerking her hips into nothing.</p><p>“I turned my hand back over and I’m sliding it lower, baby. Anything you want to ask me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyelids are fluttering like she’s having a fucking seizure and she slams them shut to stop it. Yeah, she wants to ask something. And she knows that Agatha knows that. “Are you—are you wet?” she forces out despite the embarrassment it floods her with.</p><p>Agatha makes an indulgent little sound. “Yes I am,” she says.</p><p>“What, um, what—what are you gonna do next?” Rio asks, eyes still shut. She’s never done this before. She can picture Agatha’s hand inside black panties with purple crowns, and she’s so tight and hot and wet she wants her hand inside her boxers, but she doesn’t know how this works. Is it supposed to be one at a time? Would touching herself distract her from listening to Agatha?</p><p>“What will you beg me to do next, that’s the real question,” Agatha says on the heels of another soft, indulgent sound.</p><p>“I’ve never—” Rio starts and stops, biting her lip.</p><p>“Never had phone sex?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio admits, her cheeks still burning.</p><p>“Neither have I,” Agatha says. “But I’m wet and my hand is in my panties, so beg me to do something, Rio.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio swears, trying to make her nerves stop catching fire and clouding her brain with smoke. “Can you just—can you please put your fingers inside yourself?”</p><p>“Not sure,” Agatha tuts. “Is that the best you know how to beg, baby?”</p><p>“N—no,” she confesses, shifting her weight, trying to get some friction. It’s useless, of course.</p><p>“You know I like you desperate. I’m grabbing my pants.”</p><p>“No, please,” Rio whines. “Please Agatha please, fuck, please let me hear you… please put your fingers inside yourself, as many as you can take, please please please if you’re wet you can fit at least two can’t you? Oh god, please… don’t put your pants on, I’ll be good…”</p><p>Rio can’t tell if Agatha’s response is a lethargic chuckle or a drawn-out groan. The lines are blurred. “Pants are dropped. You’ll be good, hm? How good will you be, Rio, if I put a finger inside myself? I’m rubbing up and down my slit right now and it’s so warm… I want to go inside, but I can’t until I know you’re going to be my good little bitch.”</p><p>Rio winds her free hand into her hair and whimpers at Agatha’s words, at the image of her finger sliding through her slick… “I’ll be so good Agatha, I’ll be so good for you, I promise, I’ll be your good little bitch and do whatever you tell me. I’m so wet and desperate for you it hurts, but I haven’t touched myself because you didn’t give me permission.”</p><p>This time it’s clearly a groan from Agatha. “Good girl… I’m putting two fingers inside my cunt just for you. Baby it’s so tight…”</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio breathes. “I want to see so bad.”</p><p>“I’m sure you do,” Agatha growls. “Are you ruining your boxers, Rio?”</p><p>It feels so strange to hear herself referred to as wearing boxers. She’s never worn anything but bikini cuts and thongs. And the occasional G-string. Never boy shorts and certainly never boxers. “They’re already ruined,” she confesses. “The crotch is sticking to my skin because they’re soaked through.”</p><p>She reaches down to pull on one of the legs, trying to detach it from her clammy skin and make things more comfortable for herself.</p><p>“Jesus,” Agatha says, and Rio can picture the aggrieved look on her face to go with it, maybe a hand running through her wild, messy hair.</p><p>Rio says something then that she never would’ve thought she’d say in her life. But the thought strikes her and the words tumble out. “I wish you would walk through the door right now, flip me over, and spank me for ruining clothes I borrowed…”</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha hisses. “That almost made me come.”</p><p>Agatha’s reaction spurs her on. “Just with your hand,” she clarifies. “With your other hand holding me down by pressing on the middle of my back. I wouldn’t try to get away, though…”</p><p>“Fuuuuck,” Agatha moans. “Rio… fuck. I’m rubbing my clit now, I want to come. Keep talking.”</p><p>Rio feels a heady sense of power at being able to make Agatha half as desperate as Agatha always makes her. “I wouldn’t want it too hard, though, not like last time, if that’s okay. Just enough to sting and turn my skin red and make me remember who I belong to and that it’s not nice to borrow things and ruin them…”</p><p>She can hear Agatha’s breathing getting faster and heavier.</p><p>“And you’d scold me about being responsible, and keep spanking me until I understood. I’d never try to get away, Agatha, I’d lay still and be so good for you and let you punish me…”</p><p>Agatha whimpers and there’s a slight pause, and Rio can picture her hips raising up to press against her fingers, and then a soft cry billows out followed by a series of more whimpers, and then Agatha’s quiet except for the steadying in and out of her breath.</p><p>The first thing she says makes Rio’s cheeks heat up again. “I thought you didn’t like the word spanking.”</p><p>And Rio didn’t like it, not the day it had happened, but she understands more things now. The word is growing on her. “I’m getting used to it,” she says almost shyly. “I doubt last week was the last one I’m going to get.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a breathless little laugh. “No, probably not,” she agrees. “You’re such a good girl, Rio. I can’t wait to come see you.”</p><p>Rio’s chest fills with warmth and all she wants is to be in Agatha’s arms. “I think I can sleep now, if that’s okay. Thank you for letting me call you and making me feel better.”</p><p>“I’ll always do that,” Agatha says, and Rio can hear the affection in her tone. It blankets her with that feeling of safety she’s only ever had around Agatha. “Good night, baby.”</p><p>Rio fights the silly urge to hug the phone, just because Agatha’s voice is in it. “Good night.”</p>

<p>Agatha sleeps so fucking good after that phone call she doesn’t get up until noon on Sunday, which is pretty much unheard of for her since she gave birth to Nicky. On weekends she doesn’t work, she’s usually still up by nine or ten.</p><p>Nicky and Vee are on the PS5 when she wanders out of her room at ten after twelve, and she feels weird that she slept later than teenagers.</p><p>“Hey guys,” she says, scratching the back of her neck awkwardly. “Can I make you some lunch?”</p><p>“Already ate,” Vee says without looking over her shoulder.</p><p>“Sleep good, mom?” Nicky teases, also not looking at her.</p><p>“What does <em>that</em> mean?” she asks, eyes wide.</p><p>“It’s after twelve. You never sleep this late,” Nicky says, and Agatha breathes a sigh of relief. Of course that’s what he meant.</p><p>“I was up later than usual,” she says dismissively. “But yes, thank you, I slept very well. Did you eat, Nicky, or just Vee?”</p><p>“I ate,” he says.</p><p>“What did you guys eat?” She’s suddenly suspicious. There aren’t that many groceries in the house.</p><p>“Check the kitchen,” Vee answers for him.</p><p>“If you ordered takeout—”</p><p>“You said I could buy things I directly benefit from. I directly benefited from Olive Garden delivery.”</p><p>“Loophole finding little fucker,” Agatha mumbles, and when she steps into the kitchen she loses it. “What was wrong with the kitchen table?!” she shrieks, staring at a brand new sleek oak table and matching set of chairs with velvet cushions. “Valentina!”</p><p>“Come on, it wobbled!” Vee yells into the kitchen.</p><p>“It did not wobble!” Agatha continues to shriek. Never mind that her next thought regarding the table is about bending Rio over it, she can’t have Vee continuing to buy this kind of stuff.</p><p>“It wobbled, mom,” Nicky joins in the battle.</p><p>“New rule,” Agatha says as she storms back into the living room and grabs Vee’s controller out of her hands to make sure she’s paying attention.</p><p>“Hey, what the fu—”</p><p>“New rule!” Agatha shouts. “Are you listening?”</p><p>“Jesus. Yeah, I’m listening,” Vee says, folding her arms over her chest.</p><p>“You have to ask me first before you get rid of anything or buy anything else. And I mean it. If you do it again and don’t talk to me first, I’m going to be genuinely upset. Okay?”</p><p>Vee loses the attitude immediately and nods. “Okay,” she says, dropping her arms. “I’m sorry. I’ll ask.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Agatha returns the controller and kisses the girl on top of the head. “It’s thoughtful, but it’s just… until you’re an adult you won’t understand how it feels. Okay?”</p><p>Vee nods again and curls up in the corner of the couch, eyes on the TV screen.</p><p>Guilt floods through Agatha and she sighs, wedging herself between the kids and dragging Vee into her arms. “I’m sorry,” she says. “I love how thoughtful and generous you are, honey. I truly do. I didn’t mean to hurt your feelings.”</p><p>Vee leans into her and settles. “And I’m sorry I made you feel bad. I never want to do that.”</p><p>Nicky looks over and grins. “Group hug!” he announces, dropping his controller and wrapping his arms around both her and Valentina.</p><p>“I’m squished!” she complains, but she loves it, of course.</p><p>--</p><p>After a delicious plate of fettucine alfredo and a breadstick, Agatha decides to take a bath. “Don’t come in the bathroom, I’m getting in the bath. Do either of you need to use it first, actually?”</p><p>“Yeah, I gotta pee,” Vee says, darting past Agatha into the bathroom and slamming the door in her face.</p><p>“No problem,” Agatha deadpans.</p><p>“I can go in the backyard,” Nicky says, and Agatha pulls a face at him.</p><p>“Nicholas. That’s disgusting.”</p><p>When Vee comes out, Agatha makes Nicky use the bathroom instead of the fucking yard, and when they’re both done, she turns on the bath, adjusts the temperature, and waits for it to fill up.</p><p>Just as she settles into the blissfully warm water, her phone beeps.</p><p>Her stomach clenches when she reads the message from Rio.</p><p><strong>R: they said i can have visitors strtg tmrw</strong></p><p>Her fingers are a little tremulous as she replies.</p><p><strong>A: Yes! What time are visiting hours?</strong></p><p><strong>R: 4 every1 else 8-8 4 me whenever i want</strong></p><p>Agatha’s first instinct is to tell Rio it’s not right to just buy people off, but if she says that, she’ll have to visit between eight and eight, which she can’t do. She’s barely ever off work before then, and never with enough time to actually make it to the rehab by eight.</p><p>So in selfish fashion, that particular social lesson for Rio will have to wait.</p><p><strong>A: I’ll come see you as soon as I’m done with work tomorrow.</strong></p><p><strong>R: cant wait. if ur here at nite ull see my boxers</strong></p><p>Agatha’s mouth waters at the thought.</p><p><strong>A: Didn’t you ruin them last night?</strong></p><p><strong>R: they make us do r lndry</strong></p><p><strong>A: I hope nobody saw them before you washed them…</strong></p><p><strong>R: ur mkg me blush no1 saw them</strong></p><p><strong>A: I hope you used extra detergent…</strong></p><p><strong>R: omgggggg</strong></p><p>Agatha laughs and leans her head back on the edge of the bathtub.</p><p><strong>A: See you tomorrow night, baby.</strong></p><p><strong>R: c u tmrw</strong></p><p>--</p><p>Agatha feels bad because Vee and Nicky both wanted to come with her, but she has to leave straight from work otherwise it’s an extra twenty minutes that she can’t really afford this late. She promised them they could go with her on the weekend, and they’d been good about it, but she still feels bad about having to tell them they couldn’t come.</p><p>Rio meets her at the sliding glass doors at the front of the building… literally. Before Agatha even steps through them, Rio is sitting on her hips with legs locked around her waist and arms locked around her neck. It’s a good thing she’s strong enough to carry the woman or she would’ve been knocked the fuck over.</p><p>“Hi,” she laughs, putting her own arms around Rio to hold her tight and spinning them in a circle.</p><p>“I missed you,” Rio whispers, laying her head down, face pressed to Agatha’s neck.</p><p>“I missed you too,” Agatha whispers back, holding her even tighter if possible. “Give me directions to your room.”</p><p>“Can I kiss you?”</p><p>“Once we’re in your room.”</p><p>Rio bites lightly at her neck, making her gasp, but then behaves and makes her wonder if she’d imagined it. “Go down the hallway to your right, all the way to the end, turn right, and it’s the third door on the left.”</p><p>Agatha nods and starts the walk, and she shifts Rio’s weight a little, dropping her hands from Rio’s back to her ass for better leverage, not wanting to drop her. “Isn’t it almost bedtime? Why aren’t you in your pajamas?”</p><p>“I wanted to change into them for you,” Rio says softly. “Is that okay?”</p><p>Agatha turns her face to kiss Rio’s head. “Yeah baby, that’s okay.”</p><p>The hallway isn’t that long and they’re in Rio’s room with the door shut a minute later.</p><p>“Now you can kiss me.”</p><p>Rio picks her head up and their lips press together, Agatha’s not even sure who closed the distance first.</p><p>Rio’s mouth is pliant, opening to her demanding tongue, and she licks her way inside, then captures Rio’s tongue and sucks on it.</p><p>Rio moans, offering no resistance, letting Agatha do whatever she wants.</p><p>Agatha’s fast approaching dangerous territory and she wants Rio in those boxers, now. She sets her down and pulls back from the kiss, nipping Rio’s bottom lip as she withdraws. “Get changed,” she says, and her voice comes out a lot lower than she’d planned.</p><p>Rio shivers and nods, slipping out of her dress – the one she’d worn the night she left Agatha’s to come here. She slides off her underwear, and without a bra, she’s standing just in her socks. Agatha’s not sure why she was wearing socks with a dress, but it’s adorable and she’s not complaining.</p><p>Her hands itch at her sides, fingers curling and flexing with how badly she wants to touch Rio. She watches as Rio picks up the white t-shirt laid out on the bed and slips it over her head, putting her arms through the sleeves and shaking her hair out of it.</p><p>The boxers come next, and Agatha’s practically drooling. Rio slides them slowly up her fucking perfect legs and fits them over her hips, and Agatha can’t restrain herself any longer, she steps forward and grabs Rio by the waist, squeezing.</p><p>Rio looks up in surprise, her face flushed, eyes dark.</p><p>Agatha backs her toward the bed, pushing her onto it and standing above her, staring. “Lay down.”</p><p>Rio scrambles up the bed to lay down properly, head on the pillow. Her hair’s a mess. It’s fucking breathtaking. And the way she looks in a t-shirt and boxers does things to Agatha’s insides that can never be put right again.</p><p>She gets on the bed, hovering over Rio on her hands and knees, and balances on one hand so she can reach down with the other, briefly cupping Rio’s cunt through her boxers before giving it a firm slap. “Whose is this?”</p><p>Rio yelps and arches her back, eyes instantly blown wide. “Yours,” she says without hesitation. Without even a split second’s pause.</p><p>“That’s right,” Agatha says, cupping her again. “Mine.”</p><p>Rio’s hips buck and Agatha takes her hand away, sliding it up her body over the t-shirt, pinching a nipple on her way to wind it into dark, messy hair.</p><p>Rio whines and squirms, but stills when Agatha jerks on her hair. “Say it.”</p><p>“It’s yours,” Rio gasps. “My body is yours. I—I’m yours.”</p><p>The power high at the words blends together with the hurricane of emotion she feels at those same words, because she knows Rio means it. This woman is hers. <em>Hers</em>. Rio belongs to her in <em>every</em> way. “Mine,” she says, tears stinging her eyes. “And I’m gonna fuck you so hard you never forget it.”</p><p>“Oh god, please,” Rio begs. Already.</p><p>Agatha slides her hand into Rio’s boxers and almost loses her shit at the amount of slick heat her fingers slip on. “Jesus Christ, baby,” she says in awe.</p><p>“That’s what you do to me, every day,” Rio whines, and the whine turns into a drawn-out groan as Agatha forces two fingers roughly inside her.</p><p>Rio handles it easily with how fucking wet she is, and Agatha probably could have started off with three, but she can be harder and rougher with two, and that’s what she wants right now. She’s staking her claim.</p><p>“You’re fucking mine,” she growls, curling her fingers, pulling out, thrusting in again until she literally can’t go any further.</p><p>And Rio… Rio takes it beautifully. Gratefully. Begging and whimpering and thanking her over and over, spreading her thighs to make it easier.</p><p>The rhythm Agatha sets is brutal, and Rio matches her without missing a beat. Angles her hips to take Agatha even <em>deeper</em>. Cries the prettiest tears Agatha has ever seen.</p><p>“Pl—please, I’m close, I’m so close,” she chants, tossing her head back and forth, unable to hold still. “I’m so close I’m so close, please can I come?”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth drops open, a scandalous sound drawn out of her at the question, because she’d almost forgotten what she said to Rio after fucking her with the vibrator.</p><p><em>If I ever put my hands or mouth on you, you will not come until I give you permission, do you hear me?</em></p><p>“Not yet,” she says, but she doesn’t stop fucking into Rio over and over, as hard and fast and deep as she’s physically able to go.</p><p>Rio starts to cry a little harder at that, stuttering worse than before. “B—but what if I c-c-can’t stop it? I’m try—I’m try—I’m trying so hard but p—please I can’t stop it I can’t I can’t I can’t I—”</p><p>Agatha almost comes in her pants, and she takes pity on the begging mess of a girl underneath her. “Good girl, that’s long enough. You can come, baby.”</p><p>And the moment she says baby, Rio fucking explodes.</p>

<p>Pleasure erupts from the spot deep inside where Agatha’s fingers keep hitting as soon as she’s given permission to come. And it’s a fucking flood. Her face is wet with tears, the back of her neck is wet with sweat, and her boxers are wet with her come, ruined for the second time.</p><p>Agatha groans above her, and Rio expects a cool down, but she doesn’t get one.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t stop.</p><p>“Again,” she demands, fingers plunging in over and over, thumb landing hard on Rio’s clit and starting to press.</p><p>Not even rub. Just press.</p><p>It’s enough and she shakes through another orgasm, thighs trying to clamp down on Agatha’s hand, but Agatha slots her knees between Rio’s legs to stop her from closing them.</p><p>It feels obscenely unfair, not being allowed to tighten up, to squeeze Agatha’s wrist, to ride out the orgasm strung like a bow. She has to stay open. Just take it. Let it roll through her at its own pace, unhurried by her will. “Please let me,” she begs, arching her back up off the bed.</p><p>“No,” Agatha says, and keeps fucking her, keeps her thighs from closing, and it feels so good but it’s complete torture at the same time because she has no control over the sensations; no way to heighten or lessen them with her body. “Take what I fucking give you.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice is a growl and Rio’s stomach clenches, twists, pulses in that desperate, needy, pathetic way it always does when Agatha scolds her. “I’m sorry,” she babbles, letting the words rush out unfiltered, because she can’t really filter herself at the moment and also because she knows that’s how Agatha likes it. “I’m sorry Agatha I’m so sorry, I’ll take it, I promise, I’ll be good, I’m sorry, please… please please please, I’ll take what you give me like a good girl. I’m your good girl Agatha I’ll be so good, please…”</p><p>She knows it gets to Agatha because she’s suddenly being fucked even harder, to the point Agatha’s knuckles are probably going to bruise her lips with the way they knock into her sensitive skin every time she thrusts in. “Does it hurt?” Agatha almost sneers.</p><p>“Yes ma’am,” Rio says without thinking, and she’s about to try to take it back when Agatha shudders above her and grabs her by the hair at the crown of her head, stands off the bed and flips her over.</p><p>She ends up on her hands and knees and the boxers get ripped in half, a hand coming down hard on her bare ass, and then Agatha’s inside her again, three fingers deep, stretching her so tight she drops to her elbows and buries her face in her pillow to muffle a scream.</p><p>No one has ever fucked her like this. Fucked her like their lives depend on it. Fucked her so hard and raw and relentless with no regard for her comfort.</p><p>It’s the best thing she’s ever felt. All of it. Every lick of pain and spark of pleasure.</p><p>“Come,” Agatha snarls, and Rio does. For the third time in a row.</p><p>This time Agatha lets her calm down, slowing her thrusts, carefully pulling out, pressing on Rio’s back to get her to lay on her stomach.</p><p>“You can’t say things like that to me mid-fuck,” Agatha breathes harshly, laying down next to her with a protective arm and leg slung over her shivering body.</p><p>Rio can’t move or speak, she just kind of grunts and hopes Agatha doesn’t take it as a complaint.</p><p>Every cell in her body aches and burns, strung out on something so much better than blow.</p><p>And then a hand is gently rubbing her back, up and down, the motion slow and soothing.</p><p>For all of Agatha’s sharpness, she takes such care when it’s said and done. Rio feels <em>special</em>.</p><p>“Such a good girl,” Agatha whispers, still stroking her back. “When you can say something, let me know if you’re okay.”</p><p>Lips press to the back of her head and she soaks up the praise and the affection, her screaming body starting to climb down from that razor’s edge.</p><p>Her throat is dry when she swallows. Her voice comes out raspy and shaky. “I’m okay.”</p><p>“You need water, baby,” Agatha says, nuzzling her nose into Rio’s hair.</p><p>“We’d have to go to the common room,” Rio says, and she moves just enough to shift closer to Agatha. “I don’t want to move.”</p><p>Agatha wraps her up tighter and Rio melts. “You—you know I’m yours, right? Not just for sex?”</p><p>She’s not sure what possessed her to say it, but the sudden overwhelming, burning need to make sure Agatha knows that has presented itself and her words match accordingly.</p><p>Agatha makes a soft sound that Rio doesn’t know how to classify. “I know,” she says, and it sounds almost reverent.</p><p>“And that’s—a—and that’s something you want, right?”</p><p>“It is,” Agatha says without delay. “Very much. You’re mine. Say it again without sounding like you think I might not want you.”</p><p>A warmth starts to spread in Rio’s chest and she rolls onto her side so she can curl up against Agatha. “I’m yours.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha murmurs. “Mine.”</p><p>“I don’t want you to go,” Rio says after a few minutes of comfortable silence. She’s dreading the moment Agatha will have to leave for the night.</p><p>“I’ve still got awhile,” Agatha promises. “I want to get you cleaned up in a minute though. And uh… do you have any other shorts or pants?”</p><p>“No,” Rio says. “I have my dress and this t-shirt and the pair of underwear I came in with, and I had one pair of boxers but I can’t really wear them ripped in half so…”</p><p>“No shit,” Agatha says with a little snort. “It’s still early enough to hit Walmart. I’ll go grab you some clothes and come back.”</p><p>Rio clings. “Don’t go.”</p><p>“Rio, look at me.”</p><p>Rio shakes her head, keeping it buried in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>“Look at me, Rio,” Agatha says again, tugging lightly on her hair, and Rio finally gives up with a sigh and lifts her head to look into Agatha’s sparkling blue eyes. “I’ll come right back. I promise you.”</p><p>Rio hadn’t even realized she didn’t want Agatha to leave out of fear she wouldn’t come back, but as Agatha speaks the words out loud, the truth of the fear resonates. “But what if you don’t?”</p><p>“If I didn’t want to be here, I wouldn’t have come at all,” Agatha says. “I need you to trust me. I’m going to go get you some more clothes and come back.”</p><p>Trust should be a four-letter word as far as Rio is concerned. But, she comes to understand as she thinks it over, she does trust Agatha. It’s strange, it’s disconcerting, it’s confusing, but she really does trust this woman.</p><p>Finally she nods and loosens her grip, and watches as Agatha gets out of bed.</p><p>“Get under the blankets in case anyone comes in,” Agatha says.</p><p>“No one’s just going to waltz into my room, especially not this late at night,” Rio says, and before she knows what’s happening, Agatha has a handful of her hair and jerks her to a sitting position. “Shit shit shit,” she tries to backtrack. “I’m sorry, I’ll get under the blankets…”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze is lethal. Possessive. Territorial. “Your pussy is mine and if I tell you to cover it so no one else sees what belongs to me, you’ll cover it without question, won’t you Rio?”</p><p>Rio can’t help moaning as she tries to nod, but Agatha’s grip on her hair is too tight. “Yes,” she gasps. “Yes, god, yes. I’m so sorry…” She’s going to soak the blankets at this rate.</p><p>Agatha smirks and kisses her, then uses the hand in her hair to throw her back down, and she bounces a little at the impact before settling and sliding under the blankets.</p><p>“Good girl. I’ll be right back. I’ll text you if I have any questions.”</p><p>“Wait… how are you going to get back in? I can’t come to the doors without pants.”</p><p>“I’ll tell you when I’m here and you’ll just have to put on your dress for a minute.”</p><p>Right. Duh. “Okay. See you soon,” she says, biting her lip.</p><p>Agatha blows her a kiss and then she’s gone.</p><p>Rio lays there nervous the entire time Agatha is gone, staring at her phone. What if Agatha changes her mind and doesn’t come back?</p><p>A text comes through and she opens her messages, still chewing her lip.</p><p><strong>A: Would you rather have black and white boxers or black and purple?</strong></p><p>Rio does not give two fucks.</p><p><strong>R: u choose</strong></p><p><strong>A: All right. Almost done here. Be good.</strong></p><p><strong>R: im being good just laying here under the blnkts</strong></p><p>A few minutes later she gets another text.</p><p><strong>A: Leaving Walmart. Get your dress on and meet me at the doors in 5.</strong></p><p>Feeling a little cheeky now that Agatha’s not right in front of her, Rio grins to herself as she replies.</p><p><strong>R: yes maam</strong></p><p><strong>A: Rio I swear to god…</strong></p><p>She cackles to herself and puts on her dress and skips out to wait for Agatha by the front doors.</p>

<p>Rio looks relieved to see her and it breaks Agatha’s heart a little… but not enough to get her off the hook for being a brat.</p><p>The first thing she does when Rio steps on the sensor and the doors slide open is launch herself forward and tackle Rio to the floor.</p><p>Rio squeals, eyes wide, and Agatha makes sure she doesn’t hit her head when they go down.</p><p>“You think it’s funny to taunt me?” she asks, lifting an eyebrow, pinning Rio to the floor with her body.</p><p>Rio’s eyes sparkle as they connect with hers, and she feels the hitch of breath beneath her, unsure whether Rio’s about to double down or apologize.</p><p>“I…” Rio starts and stops, biting her lip, staring up at Agatha, not fighting her hold. “I thought it was funny when you weren’t right in front of me,” she finally confesses in a whisper. “Now I think maybe I’m in trouble and should apologize…”</p><p>Agatha shifts her weight a bit, pushing her cunt against Rio’s thigh. The pressure is delicious. “That’d probably be a good idea,” she says. Fuck, Rio’s beautiful.</p><p>Rio’s eyelids flutter and she nods. “I’m sorry, Agatha,” she says, still whispering.</p><p>“What would you do if I flipped you over and spanked you right here in the lobby?” Agatha asks, tongue pressed against the back of her teeth, jaw clenched.</p><p>Rio squirms under her and lets out a quiet moan. “There’s cameras…”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“And if the staff sees they might not let you come back…”</p><p>Agatha grinds on Rio’s thigh again and thinks it over, weighing what she wants against what could happen. “You don’t think your money would take care of that?” She’s not sure why she wants it so much, but she does. She wants the staff to see how she owns Rio.</p><p>“Mayb—maybe,” Rio stutters, breath coming faster. Agatha can see her playing the options out in her head.</p><p>“I want them to know I own you,” Agatha finally confesses, not sure how Rio’s going to take it, but she’s not going to keep secrets.</p><p>Rio arches up into her and shudders, and then she nods. Just like that first night… she fucking nods, and Agatha’s free to do as she likes.</p><p>She climbs off of Rio and pulls a pair of underwear from the Walmart bag. “Get up. Put these on, bend over that chair over there, and flip up your dress.”</p><p>Rio struggles to her feet and pulls on the panties in record time, then walks the few yards to the indicated chair, bends over the arm of it, and reaches back to pull up her dress.</p><p>Agatha walks over and runs a fingertip up and down Rio’s back. “Still think it’s funny to taunt me?”</p><p>“No m—I mean just no,” Rio says.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes threaten to roll back. “You can say it if you mean it.” She grabs Rio by the hips, digging her fingernails into the sensitive skin there. “Still think it’s funny?”</p><p>“No ma’am,” Rio says, wispy.</p><p>Agatha’s so fucking wet already it would be embarrassing if Rio knew. “Count and thank me,” she says, focusing instead on what she’s doing rather than how it’s making her feel. She lifts one hand and brings it down with a loud crack on Rio’s left cheek.</p><p>Rio yips like a wounded puppy and throws her head back. “One,” she says, her pout evident in her voice. “Thank you.”</p><p>Agatha grabs her by the hair to keep her head back for a minute. “Are you fucking pouting?”</p><p>Rio goes serious instantly. “No ma’am, I’m sorry. I’ll be good.”</p><p>Agatha’s about to start dripping down her thighs, she’d swear it. She lets go of Rio’s hair and pushes on the back of her head to get her to put it back down. “That’s what I fucking thought,” she mutters, and shakes off the audacity. “You’d better be damn good. Who does this ass belong to?” She gears up and lands a stinging smack on Rio’s other cheek, the impact loud and ominous.</p><p>“You, to you,” Rio gasps, squirming over the chair. “Two, thank you,” she recites dutifully with no more traces of ill-advised pouting.</p><p>Agatha hears footsteps and feels Rio’s back tense beneath her hand. “Don’t get up,” she says, neurons firing, topspace flaring hot.</p><p>Rio doesn’t. She’s tense, but she stays draped over the chair with her dress up.</p><p>Agatha looks toward the sound of the footsteps and an orderly appears from that hallway, looking awkward and apologetic. “Hi,” he says, pressing his hands together. “It’s just… we don’t allow sexual activity in the common areas. Or—or usually at all, actually, but with Ms. Vidal’s specific circumstances, we do allow it in the privacy of her own room. Only in the privacy of her own room, however, so if you’d please take this there?”</p><p>Rio still doesn’t get up, and Agatha’s about to come in her pants. “Come on, baby,” she says, tugging Rio’s dress down for her.</p><p>Only then does Rio stand up, and slips her hand into Agatha’s, pressing herself to Agatha’s side.</p><p>“Thank you ladies,” the orderly says and makes a quick exit back in the direction he’d come from.</p><p>“Oh, you are <em>such</em> a good girl,” Agatha purrs when he’s gone.</p><p>Rio whimpers and squeezes her hand. “Can we go to my room now?”</p><p>“Yeah, we can go to your room.”</p><p>Agatha leads the way, and when they’re inside with the door shut, Rio melts fully against her, face pressed into her chest, arms slid around her back, holding tight.</p><p>“Baby,” Agatha murmurs, kissing the top of her head as she hears and feels Rio take in a deep breath. Rio’s breathing her in, she realizes, and it fills her with an overwhelming sense of affection. She wants to protect and shelter this woman from every bad thing life might have to offer.</p><p>“I was good?” Rio whispers, keeping her face pressed where it is.</p><p>Agatha holds back a moan at the way the question makes her feel – powerful, but again, protective. “Yes,” she praises. “You were <em>so</em> good, Rio. So fucking good.”</p><p>“Will you—will you touch me again? Please?”</p><p>Agatha takes her by the arms and moves her back just enough to kiss her. It’s soft. Tender. It’s communicative. She fits her lips over Rio’s and presses, keeping her mouth closed, keeping it soft. Tender. Communicative. “Is that what you want, baby?” she asks when she pulls back.</p><p>Rio is breathless, her gaze searching Agatha’s before she nods. “Please,” she begs. “Please, god, I just—I—I need—I’ve never needed anyone the way I need you. I’ve never needed anyone at all. But you make me feel like I’m gonna die if you don’t touch me. Please, Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha strokes her face and kisses her again, just a chaste little touch. “Are you going to be the best girl for me?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says instantly, eyes on fire. “Yes, I’ll be the best girl, I promise. I’ll do anything.”</p><p>“I know you will,” Agatha says fondly, her thumb rubbing back and forth over Rio’s cheek. “Take your dress off.”</p><p>Rio’s already complying before Agatha’s finished speaking, and the dress is pooled at their feet.</p><p>“Now the t-shirt.”</p><p>Rio crosses her arms in front of her and grabs the hem, lifting it up and over her head, letting it billow to the floor. She’s standing in just the panties Agatha had bought her.</p><p>“Take your hair down.”</p><p>Rio tugs the rubber band until it comes free and the messy bun unravels, her hair bouncing softly around her shoulders and down her back.</p><p>“You’re so fucking beautiful,” Agatha whispers, hand going back to Rio’s face, thumb stroking her cheek.</p><p>Rio leans into the touch and closes her eyes. “Thank you…”</p><p>“Such good manners,” Agatha praises. “Take off the underwear. Slowly.”</p><p>Rio’s breath catches and her fingers hook into the waistband. She pushes, slowly as ordered, inching the fabric over her hips and down her thighs, and when it gets to her knees, it’s loose enough to fall on its own so she just lets go and straightens back up, stepping out of the panties.</p><p>Agatha watches the whole thing with growing urgency, but she wants to take her time. The first time had been about claiming. Fucking Rio so hard she’d never forget. Now she wants to worship the goddess in front of her. Make Rio feel special; important; adored. She wants to use her <em>mouth</em>.</p><p>“Go lay on your back,” she breathes. “On the bed.” In case that wasn’t obvious.</p><p>Rio backs up until her knees hit the bed frame, and she sits, then scoots to the middle of the mattress and lays down, eyes never leaving Agatha.</p><p>Agatha crawls onto the bed after her, perching herself on her knees at the end of it. She ducks her head and sucks a mark just above Rio’s left ankle. The taste of Rio’s skin is about to be a whole new addiction. “Fuck,” she mutters, moving higher up, marking the underside of Rio’s left knee.</p><p>It’s not until she’s sucking and gently biting at Rio’s inner thigh that Rio seems to realize what she’s planning to do, because there’s a sharp gasp from the head of the bed and Rio suddenly starts squirming for all she’s worth.</p><p>“You’re—are you g—A—Agatha w—”</p><p>“Shh,” Agatha interrupts. She grimaces when Rio grabs her by the hair and pulls, and she knows it’s not intentional, it’s desperate. She doesn’t want desperate right now though. “Baby, let go of my hair,” she says gently.</p><p>“Oh no, I’m sorry,” Rio says, releasing her immediately, and instead of pulling her hair, Rio’s hands start clawing herself, over her hips and belly.</p><p>“Hey,” Agatha says, rising up to sit straddling Rio’s waist, and places her hands out, palms toward the ceiling. “Put your hands in mine,” she coaxes.</p><p>Rio does, and she’s shaking.</p><p>Agatha holds Rio’s hands, thumbs rubbing circles over the other woman’s knuckles in as soothing a manner as she can muster. She would never dream of trying to restrain Rio, given her traumatic history, but she does need Rio’s hands out of her way, without Rio inadvertently harming herself.</p><p>“Breathe with me,” Agatha says.</p><p>Rio’s eyes are hazy, but she’s focused on Agatha, and doing a pretty good job matching Agatha’s breathing pattern.</p><p>“Good girl,” she says, quiet and slow, still rubbing her thumbs over the backs of Rio’s hands. “Can you do me a favor?”</p><p>Rio nods.</p><p>“Can you fold your hands behind your head for me, baby? And keep them there?”</p><p>Rio nods again and puts her hands under her head, fingers laced together.</p><p>“Good girl, that’s so good,” Agatha praises her. “Are you going to be okay if I use my mouth on you, Rio?” Because maybe Rio’s not ready for that. Maybe she can’t handle it right now. Agatha wants it, but if Rio’s going to be too worked up over it, she can wait.</p><p>Rio’s shaking so much Agatha almost calls a full stop. But then…</p><p>“Yes,” Rio pants, eyes still glassy but wide and earnest as she nods. “I’ll behave. Please…”</p><p>“You are behaving beautifully,” Agatha assures her. “You haven’t done anything wrong, baby. I just don’t want to do something that’s going to be too much right now.”</p><p>“It’s not too much, I swear,” Rio says. “I won’t move my hands. Fuck. Agatha please.”</p><p>Agatha nods and moves so she can drop back down to lightly kiss and nip at Rio’s thigh again. She stays in the same spot, increasing the pressure of her mouth until she’s staring at a dark red splotchy mark that’s going to take days to fade.</p><p>Rio picks her head up to look at it but keeps her hands where they belong, and drops back to the pillow with an unhinged moan. “Fuck…”</p><p>“You’re so wet,” Agatha nearly moans herself. “You smell so fucking good, Rio. I can’t wait to taste you.” She drags her tongue over the crease between Rio’s thigh and hip, then bites.</p><p>Rio’s shaking so bad she has to grab her by the waist and hold her down.</p><p>“Relax, baby, I’m gonna take my time with you. We’re not in any hurry, okay?”</p><p>Rio whimpers and nods but her body language doesn’t change a bit, and Agatha licks her way up to a breast, closing her mouth over a rock hard nipple.</p><p>Rio cries out and arches up off the bed, seeking firmer contact. Agatha gives it to her, slow and heavy, using her body to pin Rio beneath her, sucking more of Rio’s breast into her mouth, putting pressure with her teeth.</p><p>Rio finally settles some, under Agatha’s weight. It seems to be just what she needed to help her calm down.</p><p>Agatha laves attention on the same breast for a long time, marking the fleshy parts and flicking her tongue back and forth over the nipple until Rio can’t take it anymore and tries to draw in on herself.</p><p>“You’re not going anywhere,” she says with a low chuckle, but she takes pity and switches to the other breast, giving it the same treatment. Rio’s chest is covered in little bruises and bite marks and she’s breathing hard, face flushed… but she’s not in overdrive anymore.</p><p>Agatha starts to slide down Rio’s body again, swirling her tongue across ribs, flanks, belly… every inch closer to Rio’s cunt making her mouth water to the point she has to forcibly swallow.</p><p>“Do you have any idea how tempting you are?” She settles between Rio’s legs and uses her thumbs to spread her girl open. “How pretty you are down here, baby? Any idea?”</p><p>She flicks her eyes upward in time to see Rio shake her head.</p><p>“Well you are, baby… your cunt is so pretty, spread open for me, soaking wet and waiting for my mouth…”</p><p>Rio groans and shifts her weight, but doesn’t start squirming again, much to Agatha’s delight.</p><p>“Good girl,” she growls, and drags the flat of her tongue through Rio’s dripping folds.</p><p>“Fuck!” Rio shouts, hips bucking into Agatha’s mouth, and she rests her forearms on Rio’s thighs to pin her down without giving up the ability to keep holding her open. She spreads further with her thumbs, exposing more of Rio’s cunt to her gaze and her mouth, and slides her tongue through again.</p><p>“I could do this for hours,” she mumbles, drowning in the taste. “Talk,” she demands after a minute of gentle licking. “Tell me how it feels.”</p><p>Rio whines and huffs and whimpers, but finally starts talking. “Good,” she squeaks. “It feels good. I—I can’t—”</p><p>“You can,” Agatha purrs, swirling the tip of her tongue in circles around Rio’s entrance but not going inside. “If you want me inside, tell me better than that.”</p><p>“Fuck, fuck, fuck,” Rio chants, and her voice is choked with tears. “It’s so good, please,” she begs. “I don’t know how to—it—it’s soft, and warm, and—and wet.”</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha praises, because she can tell it’s hard, but Rio is trying. She slides her arms under Rio’s legs and wraps them around, pulling her thighs further apart, and gives her clit a little kiss before finally pushing her tongue inside.</p><p>Rio gasps and tries to close her legs, but Agatha’s holding on tight. She starts up a rhythm of in and out, in and out, licking and curling until her jaw aches, and then withdraws to suck Rio’s clit into her mouth, swallowing the slick on her tongue.</p><p>“I’m—ohhh,” Rio groans. “Can I please put my hands in your hair? I promise not to pull I promise promise promise, Agatha please…”</p><p>Agatha comes off her clit just long enough to say “go ahead, baby” and gets right back to work.</p><p>Rio tangles her hands in Agatha’s hair, nails scratching lightly at her scalp, and it feels amazing.</p><p>She doubles her efforts, sucking and nibbling and sucking some more, and unwinds an arm from Rio’s leg so she can slide two fingers inside her.</p><p>“I’m gonna—can I please come?” Rio asks, hands tightening in Agatha’s hair, but not pulling.</p><p>“Mhmm,” Agatha hums, curling her fingers to press against the ridges along Rio’s inner wall at the same time she traps Rio’s clit between her teeth and flicks rapidly with her tongue, and Rio lets go of her hair to swipe the pillow from beneath her head and hold it over her face, muffling her scream as she comes.</p><p>Agatha rides it out with her, suckling and kissing softly at her clit, holding her fingers still until Rio starts to come down from the high and then easing them out.</p><p>Rio groans at the loss and tosses the pillow aside, and stares down at Agatha in wonder. At least that’s what it looks like.</p><p>“Um, what?” she asks self-consciously, crawling up to lay beside Rio and offering her fingers by way of placing the tips against Rio’s bottom lip.</p><p>“Nothing, you’re just… amazing,” Rio says, quiet and peaceful, and cleans off Agatha’s fingers at a lazy pace. When they’re gleaming, not a drop of slick left on them, she continues. “If someone would’ve told me a month ago that I’d be begging permission to come, I don’t think laughter would’ve been a strong enough reaction. But now… after being with you, I can’t imagine anything else. I don’t know how you did that to me.”</p><p>“Is that a complaint?” Agatha asks, mostly joking to hide the flare of insecurity she feels.</p><p>“No,” Rio says, eyes going slightly wide. “Never.”</p><p>The little prickle of fear in her chest settles and she drapes an arm and a leg over Rio, holding her close, reaching down blindly to grab the blanket and pull it up over them.</p><p>Rio snuggles in, eyelids heavy, and tucks her head against Agatha’s neck. “Are you… are you sleeping here?” she asks.</p><p>“I don’t know,” Agatha says. “I should get home to the kids. I just don’t want to leave you.”</p><p>“Maybe you can set an alarm for a half hour or something?” Rio suggests. “I’m trying not to be selfish.”</p><p>“You’re doing very well with that,” Agatha says, kissing the top of her head. “I think setting an alarm for a half hour is a good compromise.”</p>

<p>Rio revels in every single minute of that half hour and finds herself approaching tears when Agatha’s alarm goes off. “How do I make this achy feeling go away?” she whispers. Maybe Agatha can tell her how to shut these emotions off.</p><p>“Do you know what’s causing it?” Agatha asks, hitting snooze on the alarm – Rio can see when she taps it.</p><p>It’s not obvious what’s causing it? What else would be causing an achy feeling besides Agatha’s impending absence? “You’re going to leave in a minute,” she says, curling her hands around Agatha’s shirt.</p><p>Agatha’s breath rushes out. “Oh, it’s—you get an achy feeling when I’m—”</p><p>She can’t seem to finish her sentence so Rio finishes it for her. “When you’re not around.”</p><p>It’s hard to read Agatha’s expression, but her movements are soft and gentle, so Rio can tell she’s not upset. Agatha runs fingers through her hair and gives it a mild tug, and Rio melts a little.</p><p>“I hate to tell you, but I don’t think there’s any cure for that feeling,” Agatha says after a minute.</p><p>“What <em>is</em> the feeling?” Rio asks. She’s never wanted anyone around before. All of this is so brand new and she has no idea how to navigate.</p><p>“I don’t know that it has a name exactly. It probably just means you miss me.”</p><p>“I hate it,” Rio confesses. “It’s tight and it hurts. Like my body can’t relax. I just want to—” She stops and stares at Agatha with wide eyes, shaking her head. “Never mind.” She’s not about to tell Agatha she just wants to sniff the feeling away.</p><p>“You can be honest with me,” Agatha says, and of course she’d say that. Of course she’d notice what Rio is desperate to hide from her. “I know you’re going to have cravings, baby. What I don’t want is you thinking you can’t share that with me.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes are stinging, the tears finally forming, and she buries her face in Agatha’s chest. “I just want the easy way out,” she cries. “One or two lines and this ache in my chest disappears…”</p><p>She feels Agatha’s arms tighten around her, holding her close. “I know, baby,” Agatha whispers, kissing the top of her head. “I know. I’m sorry it’s so hard for you to feel things. But I’m here, Rio.”</p><p>It’s like once the gates have opened, there’s nothing stopping the tears from flooding out, and Rio cries against Agatha, taking comfort in the affection she’s being shown, but everything hurts so much. “Don’t go, please,” she begs, hating herself for it. She’s trying so hard to think of the kids, to put them first, but right now that feels impossible, because they’d be okay for one night without Agatha and Rio won’t. “Please, I need you,” she sobs.</p><p>“Oh, baby,” Agatha soothes, and Rio can hear tears in her voice too. “How about I text the kids and ask them how they feel about me staying the night here. Does that sound fair?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says immediately, nodding, the fabric of Agatha’s shirt wet underneath her face.</p><p>Agatha picks up her phone and types out a message, but Rio can’t see it because her face is still buried and she doesn’t want to give up her spot. Everything feels so much safer when she’s tucked into Agatha like this.</p><p>A minute later Agatha snorts and puts her phone down. “Nicky said it’s fine, and Vee said only if she gets my bed for the night.”</p><p>Rio tenses, because what if Agatha doesn’t want someone else sleeping in her room? What if she told Valentina no and she has to leave now? That achy feeling in her chest is tightening and expanding and—</p><p>“What’s wrong?” Agatha asks, running a hand up and down her back. “I thought you wanted me to stay.”</p><p>Rio breathes a sigh of relief. She should learn to just ask questions instead of letting her thoughts run wild. “I was worried you might not want to let her sleep in your room and you’d have to go,” she admits.</p><p>Agatha sighs and tilts Rio’s head up to look at her, and Rio goes without a fight. “You’re so pretty,” she says, grinning and kissing the tip of Rio’s nose. “And ridiculous. In what universe am I going to refuse to let your niece use my bedroom so I can stay the night here with you? It’s not like if she sleeps in my bed I can never sleep in it again. It doesn’t get consumed upon use.”</p><p>Rio stares, feeling her cheeks flush at the gentle teasing. The embarrassment sits well with her and makes her a little wet, and she bites her lip, lifting one of her shoulders in a shrug.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes light up and a smirk pulls at her lips and suddenly there’s a firm hand on the back of her neck, squeezing. “You think a shrug is an acceptable way to answer me?” Agatha purrs.</p><p>Rio’s neurons start coming back to life rapid fire and she presses her thighs together, squirming. She wants to see just what she can get away with, so instead of answering with words, she just shakes her head no.</p><p>“Rio Vidal,” Agatha growls, and Rio instantly folds.</p><p>“No no, I’m sorry… it’s not acceptable, not at all,” she rushes to backtrack and fix her mistake. Nerves twist in her belly and she doesn’t know whether she hopes Agatha will forgive her or punish her.</p><p>“You know… I didn’t get to finish your spanking, did I?” Agatha asks, tilting her head, tapping a finger against her lips in feigned thought.</p><p>Rio’s breath catches in her throat and she clenches her ass cheeks reflexively. She knows better than to assume the question was rhetorical. “No, you—you didn’t,” she exhales.</p><p>“Fuck, I wish I’d brought a strap.”</p><p>Rio hears herself squeak, and it’s a pathetic little sound, and now she can’t think of anything she wants more than to be bent over and railed with Agatha’s strap. “God,” she whines, unable to hold still.</p><p>“Would you like that?” Agatha asks, pressing their lips together briefly.</p><p>Rio whimpers into the kiss and nods. “Yes, please. Please.”</p><p>Agatha kisses her again, along her jaw, and she’s starting to feel delirious. Agatha’s lips are so soft, and so insistent at the same time…</p><p>“How would you want it?” Agatha murmurs against her skin.</p><p>Rio’s trembling now, she can feel her hands shaking even as they grip Agatha’s shirt tighter. “I—oh,” she says, distracted when Agatha nips at her jaw. “I—I think I’d like it if you bent me over something…”</p><p>Agatha chuckles and tugs Rio’s earlobe with her teeth, then speaks directly against her ear. “How delightfully dirty of you, baby. Wanting to be bent over and fucked from behind…”</p><p>Rio presses closer to Agatha, seeking firmer contact, just needing more. More of everything. “Would you?” she asks, quiet and hesitant, because what if Agatha doesn’t like the idea?</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha groans. “I would fuck you ten ways from Tuesday.” And before Rio has time to ask what exactly that means, Agatha tells her. “Which means I would fuck you any time, any place, and in any way.”</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio breathes, because if that doesn’t sound like perfection, she doesn’t know what would. “And what about… will I ever get to please you? I try so hard to be good and keep my hands to myself because you scold me whenever I try to touch you, but I just… you’re so… I just want you so much. I’ve been complacent in the past, because I didn’t care about anyone I slept with, but you, I want so bad.”</p><p>Agatha takes a deep breath and places a firm kiss to her temple. “We’ll see,” she says, and doesn’t elaborate, so Rio doesn’t push it. She doesn’t want to get into any <em>actual</em> trouble, or make Agatha uncomfortable and want to leave.</p><p>So she just lays her head down and snuggles in. “Are you tired?”</p><p>Agatha wraps Rio in her arms again and settles. “Yeah. You?”</p><p>“Exhausted.”</p><p>“Good night, baby.”</p><p>Rio’s never going to get tired of hearing Agatha call her baby. It fills her chest with the opposite of that tight ache that she feels when Agatha’s not there. “Night,” she mumbles, already starting to drift off.</p><p>--</p><p>In the morning, she walks Agatha to the doors, not sure how exactly to say goodbye with other people around. Will Agatha kiss her? Or just hug? Or not do anything at all?</p><p>She thinks back to last night, to bending over the armchair because Agatha wanted the staff to know she owns Rio, and her uncertainty starts to fade. Agatha’s probably going to grab her and kiss her senseless, and she doesn’t need to worry.</p><p>Sure enough, a hand winds into her hair and pulls her close, and Agatha kisses her until she can’t breathe, not caring who’s watching. “See you soon, baby.”</p><p>Rio mewls softly, and she knows she looks like an idiot, but she can’t help grinning as she watches Agatha leave.</p><p>“You got to have an overnight visitor?” some guy asks, and Rio feels the grin slide off of her face as she looks at him.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So that’s not allowed, that’s bullshit,” he says.</p><p>Rio might be required to answer Agatha with words, but nobody else. She just shrugs at him and walks away, heading back to her room to get dressed and ready for breakfast.</p><p>Just as she starts to eat, a woman sits across from her, and she does her best not to pull a face at that choice.</p><p>“Your girlfriend is hot,” the woman says.</p><p>Rio chokes on her toast and has to drink a lot more water than she’d like to get rid of the tickle, and then she stares at the woman. “I don’t think she’s my girlfriend.”</p><p>The woman blinks at her. “You don’t know? How can you not know that? Word is she spent the night.”</p><p>“Why is everyone so interested in my business?” Rio complains.</p><p>“The only interesting thing in rehab is other people’s business,” the woman says with a snort. “If she’s not your girlfriend, do you think she—”</p><p>Rio’s on her feet, tray upended into the woman’s lap without a second thought, and she stalks back to her room, jealousy flaring hot.</p><p>She’s pacing back and forth in front of her bed when there’s a knock on the door and it opens a crack, an orderly sticking his head in. The same one from last night. “Heeeey,” he says awkwardly. “So… we’re actually going to need you to come back to the cafeteria and pick up after yourself. You know, the whole taking responsibility thing and such. I mean, it’s not my rule, it’s in the company’s mission statement, all that, so… if you don’t mind?”</p><p>Rio stares at him. “Get out of my room,” she says, eyebrows lifting. “I’m sure the janitor can sweep up the mess.”</p><p>“Riiiight. So, that’s not actually how things work here? If you don’t want to come clean up after yourself they’re probably going to revoke your visitor privileges, I mean—”</p><p>Rio lets out a frustrated scream and he jumps back as she strides toward the door, out into the hallway, and fairly stomps back to the cafeteria.</p><p>She picks up everything that’s big enough to grab with her hands and dumps it into the nearest trash can, then starts to leave again, but the orderly shakes his head.</p><p>“The juice?”</p><p>“Well is somebody gonna get me a fucking mop or something?”</p><p>Nobody moves.</p><p>“The mop is over there,” the orderly says, pointing to one corner of the cafeteria.</p><p>Rio turns her head and sees it leaning against the wall, and when it becomes obvious no one is going to bring it to her, she clenches her fists and goes to retrieve it.</p><p>It’s heavy and disgusting and she hates every second of it, but she flops it over the juice and pushes it back and forth until the liquid is all soaked up, then lets the handle fall to the floor and tries to leave yet again.</p><p>“Um, you need to put it back where you got it,” the orderly says as she passes him.</p><p>Rio skids to a stop. “Are you fucking kidding me?”</p><p>“Definitely not kidding you,” he says, trying to smile, but it looks like a grimace.</p><p>“With the amount of money I’m paying to be here, you should be falling over yourself trying to clean up after me,” she snaps at the guy, but at the risk of Agatha not being allowed to come see her, she picks up the mop and returns it to the corner.</p><p>If the orderly says one more thing about it she’s going to become physically violent.</p><p>Luckily that seems to be the end of it, and he lets her leave without following.</p><p>When she’s back in her room she shoots off a text to Agatha, complaining.</p><p><strong>R: they made me cln up my brkfst</strong></p><p><strong>A: What?</strong></p><p><strong>R: it spilled they wldnt cln it 4 me</strong></p><p><strong>A: You thought someone else was going to clean up your mess?</strong></p><p><strong>R: yeah</strong></p><p><strong>A: How did your breakfast spill?</strong></p><p>Maybe she shouldn’t have started this conversation. She was hoping for sympathy from Agatha but that is clearly not where things are headed.</p><p><strong>R: just did</strong></p><p><strong>A: Rio…</strong></p><p><strong>R: i spilled it</strong></p><p><strong>A: The entire breakfast?</strong></p><p><strong>R: yeah</strong></p><p><strong>A: What aren’t you telling me? How did your entire breakfast spill? Was it on purpose, Rio?</strong></p><p><strong>R: this grl was hitting on u</strong></p><p><strong>A: What?!</strong></p><p><strong>R: this grl sat by me and was hitting on u</strong></p><p><strong>A: How can someone hit on me when I wasn’t there?</strong></p><p><strong>R: she said ur hot</strong></p><p>She definitely shouldn’t have started this conversation.</p><p><strong>A: Let me see if I’ve got this. You purposely spilled your breakfast on someone because she said I’m hot?</strong></p><p><strong>R: when u say it like that it snds bad</strong></p><p><strong>A: But I’m correct???? That’s what happened?!</strong></p><p><strong>R: um yeah</strong></p><p><strong>A: And then you expected someone else to clean it up?</strong></p><p>Rio’s cheeks are flaming. She wishes she could cancel the last five minutes.</p><p><strong>R: can i stop answrg now</strong></p><p>The phone rings. Her heart starts racing as she stares at the incoming call information, trying to get the nerve to answer.</p><p>She only lets it ring once, then hits the accept button and puts the phone to her ear. “Hello?” she says, ready to cringe.</p><p>“Tell me the entire story, Rio,” Agatha says. “Now.” There’s definitely amusement in her voice, but it’s layered underneath disapproval.</p><p>Rio climbs into bed and pulls the blankets up around her, as if that will protect her from Agatha’s reaction to the story. “I was trying to eat my breakfast and this woman came and sat down, and said you were hot. And she said… she said that if you weren’t my girlfriend, did I think you…”</p><p>“Did you think I would what?”</p><p>“I didn’t let her get that far, I flipped my tray into her lap,” Rio says, her face on fire even though Agatha can’t see her.</p><p>“Oh my god,” Agatha says, and Rio can picture her pinching the bridge of her nose or something. “And then what?”</p><p>“Then I went back to my room. And that orderly from last night came and told me I had to clean up after myself or they’d revoke my visitor privileges, so I cleaned up the mess.”</p><p>“I said the whole story and you’re obviously leaving out parts,” Agatha says, unimpressed with her, Rio can tell. “He just came to your room and threatened you off the bat?”</p><p>Rio doesn’t like the whiny noise that leaves her throat. “No, he told me I needed to clean it up, and I said to get out of my room and I was sure the janitor could sweep it,” she admits, feeling slightly ashamed of her behavior now that she is having to tell Agatha about it. She doesn’t care what anyone else thinks of her, but she cares a lot what Agatha thinks.</p><p>“Why would you be so fucking rude to people who are trying to help you?” Agatha asks, and Rio feels it like a gut punch.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” she says softly.</p><p>“When I get there tonight, you’re going to regret behaving like a spoiled asshole. And I’m not the one you’ll be apologizing to. At least not the only one. Do you understand?”</p><p>She’s playing with the blanket as Agatha tells her off, for something to do with her free hand. She swallows hard before responding. “Yes, I understand.”</p><p>“And you had better spend the rest of today on your best behavior,” Agatha continues to scold her.</p><p>“I will,” Rio promises, plucking at the threads of the blanket edge. “I’m in trouble?” She knows the answer, but she still wants to hear Agatha say it.</p><p>“Yeah baby, you’re in trouble,” Agatha says. “Big trouble.”</p><p>She doesn’t know why it’s so exciting to her to be in trouble, but for some reason it just absolutely thrills her, even though she genuinely hates to disappoint Agatha. “Are you mad at me?” she checks.</p><p>“Not on your life,” Agatha swears. “I have to go to work now, so you be a good girl, okay?”</p><p>“Yes ma’am I will,” Rio says, and she means it. She’ll go out of her way to make sure she’s nice for the rest of the day. So at least when Agatha gets there later, she’ll have some good behavior to counter the bad.</p>

<p>“Are you going by yourself again?” Nicky asks Agatha in the morning before school.</p><p>Agatha owes Rio a punishment, but the kids want to see her, and she’s not going to make them wait just because she wants to get freaky with her g—with Rio. Maybe there’s a way she can work it out to do both. “What if we take separate cars? I’m sure you’ll both want to leave long before I’m ready to go. We can go pick up Rio’s car and I’ll drive that, and Vee, you can drive mine.”</p><p>Vee talks around a mouthful of waffle, waving her hand along with her words. “Sounds good to me. I won’t say no to driving.”</p><p>“Nicky?”</p><p>“Fine with me,” he says, beaming. “She drives kinda fast though.”</p><p>“Fucking traitor,” Vee mutters under her breath, and Agatha figures she kicks Nicky under the table because he jumps and gasps.</p><p>“Ow!”</p><p>“Speed limit,” Agatha says, pointing a finger at Valentina. “I’ll be behind you, so I’ll know if you’re speeding.”</p><p>Vee groans and rolls her eyes, and gets up to take her plate to the sink. “Yeah, yeah. Fucking squares.”</p><p>Agatha almost chokes on her coffee at that. She’s so far from a square it’s not even funny. But Vee definitely doesn’t need to know it. “Obeying traffic laws doesn’t make us squares,” she calls to Vee’s retreating form.</p><p>Valentina flips her off over one shoulder and keeps walking.</p><p>Agatha snorts and shakes her head, looking at Nicky. “I made you a turkey and cheese, it’s on the top shelf in the fridge, and there’s ham for Vee. I’ll see you after work, I love you,” she says, kissing the top of his head and making her way to the door.</p><p>“Thanks mom, love you too,” he says, smoothing down his hair after the kiss. He’s always been very particular about his hair, but she can’t blame him – it <em>is</em> pretty great.</p><p>--</p><p><strong>A: The kids are coming, but we’re driving separate so I can stay after they leave. Don’t think you’re off the hook.</strong></p><p>Agatha smirks at the message she sends Rio, pulling out of the driveway in Rio’s car.</p><p><strong>R: how ur drvg seprtly</strong></p><p>God, she’s going to have to address the texting issue soon. She’s not sure how much longer she can take it.</p><p><strong>A: I’m driving your car.</strong></p><p><strong>R: !!</strong></p><p><strong>A: Is that not okay?</strong></p><p><strong>R: u didnt ask</strong></p><p><strong>A: Do I need to ask?</strong></p><p><strong>R: well</strong></p><p><strong>R: no i guess not</strong></p><p><strong>A: If you’d rather I call the kids back and we all come together, I can do that.</strong></p><p><strong>R: no</strong></p><p><strong>A: Then why are you arguing?</strong></p><p><strong>R: idk</strong></p><p><strong>A: Are you trying to get yourself into even more trouble?</strong></p><p><strong>R: no I promise</strong></p><p><strong>R: i was just srprsd idc if u drv my car</strong></p><p><strong>A: You just thought you’d be difficult for no reason then?</strong></p><p><strong>R: no no no</strong></p><p><strong>A:You should probably just stop texting before you really fuck things up for yourself, Rio.</strong></p><p><strong>R: sorry</strong></p><p><strong>A: Go lay down in your bed and wait for us. I’ll text when we’re there.</strong></p><p><strong>R: ok</strong></p><p>She puts the phone away, puffing out a breath and shaking her head. Rio is in for it.</p><p>--</p><p>Rio greets them at the doors, and Agatha gives her a quick hug before stepping aside to let the kids talk to her.</p><p>“Hey,” Vee says awkwardly, hands shoved in her pants pockets. She doesn’t hug Rio, but Nicky does.</p><p>“Hi,” he says. “How are you doing?”</p><p>Agatha loves him so fucking much. He’s literally the best child in the entire world, the sweetest and most thoughtful boy, always. She had thought he would withdraw in his teen years like most kids, but he hadn’t. Not even for a minute. She’s so proud of the little man he’s become.</p><p>“I’m okay,” Rio says, shifting her weight back and forth from one foot to the other.</p><p>Agatha can tell she’s nervous. “Do you want to show them your room?” she suggests.</p><p>“Sure,” Rio says, biting her lip, and spins to head down the hallway.</p><p>Agatha slings her arms around the kids’ shoulders and drags them after Rio. “She gets her own room because she’s a rich brat,” she stage whispers, and Rio stops walking so suddenly that Agatha runs into her.</p><p>“Are you ever gonna stop using your money to manipulate people Aunt Rio?” Vee asks, looking around the private room.</p><p>“If I do, you won’t be getting three hundred a day,” Rio says, and Agatha puts a hand over her mouth to keep from laughing, because that was a pretty damn good comeback.</p><p>Vee’s jaw drops and she stares at her aunt. “Wow. Yeah, okay, you win that round.”</p><p>“She’s very funny when she’s sober,” Agatha offers.</p><p>Valentina eyes Rio sideways. “So it would seem.” She clears her throat and stares at her shoes, scuffing the toe of one on the carpet. “I’m glad you are. Sober, I mean. I’m glad you’re sober.”</p><p>Agatha feels herself smiling at them both.</p><p>“Thanks,” Rio says, a bit self-consciously, biting her lip again.</p><p>“Me too,” Nicky says, more enthusiastically than Vee. “And when you get out of here, we can try Monopoly again, right?”</p><p>“I want to,” Rio says. “You’ll have to teach me how to play, though.”</p><p>“You haven’t played Monopoly?” Vee asks with a snort, and then Agatha watches as realization sinks in, and Vee goes from incredulous to heartbroken in the span of about five seconds. “You—you—” Her eyes fill with tears and she pulls her hands out of her pockets, wrapping her arms around Rio. “I’m so sorry, it’s all his fault, you never got to play any games at all, did you?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes are wide and her body is rigid, but she slowly acclimates to the hug and finally returns it. “You don’t have to be sorry,” she whispers. “None of it was your fault. You weren’t even born yet.”</p><p>“But he was my dad, and he was good to me,” Valentina says miserably. “My whole life was a lie…”</p><p>“No it wasn’t,” Rio says, and Agatha can see her squeezing Valentina. “I never wanted you to know what happened. I never wanted to ruin your memories of him. I just—I had to know if he abused you too, or I would never have said anything about it. I’m so sorry…”</p><p>“It’s not your fault either,” Vee insists.</p><p>“It’s neither of your fault,” Agatha steps in. “Neither of you need to be sorry for what he did. It’s his fault, and only his. We’re going to leave the blame where it belongs, and both of you have the rest of your lives to heal together, okay?”</p><p>Both of her girls nod, and Nicky jumps on them, shouting his customary “group hug!”</p><p>Agatha joins in, and they’re all in a pile on the floor a few seconds later, the hurt forgotten for the moment.</p><p>--</p><p>After another ten minutes or so, Agatha suggests the kids get home to do homework and get some sleep, because it’s already after nine o’clock. She walks them to the car, hugs them both, reminds Vee to drive safely, and waits until they’re on the road before she grabs a half gallon of apple juice from Rio’s car and heads back inside.</p><p>Rio stares at the jug in her hand as they walk down the hall to her room. “What’s that for?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer her, just sets the juice on the floor by the door, makes sure the door is shut, and then grabs Rio’s collar, yanking her into a kiss.</p><p>Rio moans against her mouth, going instantly pliant, giving up whatever Agatha wants to take from her, and Agatha loves every second of it. She takes everything, including Rio’s breath.</p><p>“Baby,” she husks when she pulls back, a hand wrapped in the hair at the base of Rio’s neck, “you were naughty today.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes are glassy, her eyelids already heavy. “I’m sorry,” she offers, the words rasping out on an exhale.</p><p>“Say it,” Agatha demands.</p><p>“I was naughty today,” Rio whispers.</p><p>“Again,” Agatha says, unsatisfied.</p><p>Rio’s jaw works in silence for a beat before she says it again. “I was naughty today.” Her voice is subtly louder.</p><p>“You were,” Agatha agrees. “Tell me what you did.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks flush and Agatha fucking adores it. She craves that blush; would chase it to the ends of the earth.</p><p>“I dumped my breakfast tray into a woman’s lap for being interested in you, and left it for the staff to clean up,” Rio says, squirming but not fighting the hold on her hair.</p><p>“And?” Agatha asks, squeezing.</p><p>Rio moans, a soft, gentle sound, and keeps talking. “And when an orderly told me to clean up after myself, I was rude and refused. I—I said the janitor could sweep it up. And he said my visiting privileges would be revoked if I didn’t do it, so I—I did it.”</p><p>Rio’s trembling in her grip, and Agatha draws a fingernail down the side of her face. “Did you get it right the first time or did he have to send you back?”</p><p>Rio gasps, pressing herself further into Agatha’s space, and whimpers out a response. “He had to send me back… first to mop up my juice, and then again to put away the mop.”</p><p>Agatha purrs low in her throat. “So you didn’t do a good job,” she says. “You didn’t try your best.”</p><p>Rio whimpers again. “No ma’am I did not.”</p><p>Agatha licks her way along Rio’s jaw and nibbles on her earlobe. “Now can you guess what the juice is for?”</p><p>Rio sags against her and she shoots her free arm around her girl’s waist to hold her close and keep her knees from giving out completely. “You’re gonna make me clean it up.”</p><p>“Smart girl,” Agatha hums against the top of Rio’s head. “But first… I’m gonna finish last night’s spanking so you’re nice and sore while you’re cleaning up my mess.”</p><p>Rio makes a strangled noise and clings to her. “Please, yes,” she says, voice strained.</p><p>“Bend over the bed,” Agatha says. Rio’s in one of the outfits she’d gotten from Walmart last night – black and white boxers and a white beater tank. She watches Rio comply. “Boxers around your knees.”</p><p>Rio reaches her hands back and pushes the boxers down. Agatha goes to stand behind her, a little off to the side.</p><p>“Press up so your arms are straight. I can’t lean over that far every time I hit you.”</p><p>Rio adjusts her position so she’s still bent over the bed, but her ass is presented on a level that will be easier to reach.</p><p>“Good girl,” Agatha says, but it’s cursory and clipped, not meant to be dwelled on at the moment. She rests one hand on Rio’s lower back and smacks her sharply on the ass.</p><p>Rio rocks forward a bit, mewling softly, then moves back into place. “Should I count and thank you?” she asks, turning her head to look at Agatha over her shoulder.</p><p>Agatha thinks about it for a second and then nods. “Yeah. I think so.”</p><p>“Is—was that one or three? Since it’s—since you’re finishing it from last night?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t know why that question is so fucking hot, but it makes her clench, her stomach pulsing. “Three,” she decides.</p><p>“Three, thank you,” Rio recites and turns her head back to face the mattress.</p><p>Agatha rubs the red spot a few times, then spanks Rio’s other cheek, her hand clapping down firmly, the sound echoing around the room.</p><p>“Four, thank you,” Rio says, rocking forward with the impact, then pushing back into position.</p><p>Agatha again rubs the reddened skin, taking her time. “Are you ready for the next one?” she asks quietly.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio says. “Yes. Yes please.”</p><p>Agatha bites her lip, eyes fluttering closed for a minute, just taking in the situation; Rio’s eagerness and compliance. “Do you <em>want</em> the next one?” she asks, opening her eyes.</p><p>“Yes, I—I do,” Rio stutters.</p><p>Agatha leans over and places the sweetest, most affectionate open-mouthed kiss on Rio’s back.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio gasps, pressing herself up into Agatha’s mouth, to which Agatha straightens up and lands the next spank. She cups her palm slightly to enhance the feeling for herself and Rio, and the sound is like a shot.</p><p>Rio moans and throws her head back, hips chasing nothing. “Five,” she says, and Agatha can see her arms shaking. “Thank you ma’am.”</p><p>Agatha’s so wet it’s uncomfortable, and she almost decides to postpone the punishment and just take Rio apart right here right now… but that wouldn’t teach a very good lesson. She can control herself. She’s used to waiting for things she wants. Rio’s not going anywhere, they can fuck later. “You’re being very good,” she says instead. “But I don’t think you can hold yourself up much longer. You’re shaking, baby.”</p><p>“I’m—I’m okay,” Rio swears.</p><p>“Don’t you dare lie to me,” Agatha says, voice dropping.</p><p>Rio sucks in a sharp breath and shakes her head. “I’m not, I’m not lying, I wouldn’t. I promise I’m okay, I—I think I can hold myself up a little longer.”</p><p>“Hm.” Agatha’s not sure if she believes it, but she’ll give Rio the benefit of the doubt. She rubs the heated skin a few times and then gears up, withdrawing and bringing her hand down to deliver two punishing slaps in a row on each cheek.</p><p>Rio’s arms give out and she collapses over the bed, and when she tries to push back up, Agatha puts a hand between her shoulder blades to stop her. “It’s okay, baby,” she coaxes. “Stay down.”</p><p>Rio’s panting a little, fingers curled around the blankets in a desperate grip. “S—six, seven, eight, nine,” she counts. “Thank you, thank you thank you thank you.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t expect the four thank-yous in a row, and it <em>does</em> something to her. She leans over and presses herself to Rio’s back, teeth scraping a bare shoulder before she bites.</p><p>Rio lets out a cry and ruts her hips against the mattress, and Agatha’s not about to let her get away with that.</p><p>“No,” she barks, sharp and disapproving.</p><p>“I’m sorry!” Rio gasps. “I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to, please, I’m so sorry, I’ll be good. I swear I’ll be good. I’ll be so good…”</p><p>“Don’t do it again,” Agatha snaps.</p><p>Rio starts to cry, shaking her head almost violently. “I won’t, I promise, I’m sorry Agatha, I’m so sorry for being bad…”</p><p>Agatha strokes a hand through her hair, still leant over her, pressed against her back. “You <em>were</em> bad, weren’t you, Rio? Grinding into the mattress like that? Without permission? Without <em>my</em> permission?”</p><p>“Yes,” Rio nods, still crying, wiping her eyes on the blanket, but fresh tears take their place. “That was so bad, I shouldn’t have done it, I should’ve been good for you. I want to be so good for you. Please—please forgive me. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p>“Mmm,” Agatha purrs, nuzzling the back of Rio’s head with her nose. “I forgive you, baby. And I know you won’t do it again.”</p><p>“N—no, never,” Rio says.</p><p>“Because you take what I give you, and <em>only</em> what I give you, isn’t that right?” Agatha says against her ear.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio breathes out harshly. “God, yes.”</p><p>“And why is that?” Agatha prompts, clenching her thighs together.</p><p>“Because you own me,” Rio says with a whimper.</p><p>Agatha had expected a less potent variant of that ideal, like Rio to say ‘because I’m yours’, and she is not prepared for the visceral way she reacts. She feels insane; feral. The urge to claw Rio to shreds rises up her chest and it’s choking her. She can’t even speak, she just stands up and pulls Rio with her, and slams her into the wall.</p><p>Rio yelps when she hits the wall, eyes wide when Agatha shoves a knee between her legs, but she doesn’t grind down. She doesn’t move at all.</p><p>It isn’t meant as a test, but if it was, Rio would have passed with flying colors.</p><p>Her hands go to Rio’s waist, dragging her forward, the denim of Agatha’s jeans rough against her bare cunt, and Rio shudders, putting her hands behind her on the wall.</p><p>The boxers still stretched around Rio’s knees are suddenly annoying and Agatha stomps on them to get them the rest of the way down, then returns her knee to the warmth of Rio’s slit and drags the girl forward again.</p><p>“Ride,” she grits out, the one word all she can manage to say.</p><p>And Rio does. She rides like a prize. She’s fucking <em>perfect</em> and Agatha can’t get enough.</p><p>It doesn’t take long for Rio to start making noises, little desperate grunts and moans and whines as she chases the feelings Agatha’s doing her best to provide.</p><p>“Am I—am I allowed to come?” Rio’s breaths are coming hot and heavy, her chest heaving, her voice like she’s swallowed thunder.</p><p>Agatha should say no, because technically Rio’s in trouble, but all she wants is to make this perfect little princess feel good. “Yes,” she growls. She squeezes Rio’s waist, helping her ride, flexing the muscles in her thigh every time Rio bucks forward.</p><p>And then Rio’s hands come off the wall and her arms wrap tight around Agatha’s neck, face buried against her throat, and she’s shaking through a violent storm.</p><p>Agatha holds her steady, and when the aftershocks are through, she slides her hands down to Rio’s ass and lifts her up.</p><p>Rio wraps her legs around Agatha’s waist, her arms still clinging around Agatha’s neck, and she’s crying.</p><p>“I’m here,” Agatha promises, her faculties finally returned enough to speak more than one word at a time. “I’ve got you, baby. You’re such a good girl.”</p><p>Rio sobs into her throat, still shaking, and Agatha sits on the bed with her. Now that she doesn’t have to hold Rio up, she moves her hands to rub up and down her girl’s back under the tank top.</p><p>“Good girl,” she says again, coating her voice with honey, trying to let Rio know she’s safe and loved. Or—or—cared for. Safe and cared for. Right? Yes. Safe and cared for. “You’re my sweet girl, aren’t you, baby?”</p><p>Rio manages a nod even if she doesn’t stop crying and clinging.</p><p>“Yeah, you are,” Agatha agrees, still rubbing her back. “So good for me.”</p><p>Rio nods again, and Agatha just holds her like that for a long time, letting her cry.</p><p>When the tears slow down to sniffles, Agatha starts rocking a little and humming softly. She’s not even sure what tune it is, just something she heard once and liked the sound of, and it stuck in her brain without words or a name. Rio seems to like it, because she calms down even more, her vise grip on Agatha’s neck finally loosening, her sniffles further apart.</p><p>“What was that all about, hmm? Are you okay?”</p><p>“I’m okay,” Rio sniffs. “I just got overwhelmed. I was—I just—I have so many feelings, Agatha. In general now that I’m sober, and—” She stops and swallows and breathes out sharply through her nose, almost like a little huff. “And for you.”</p><p>Agatha’s heart skips in her chest and starts thumping against her sternum, because—“For me? Feelings for me?” she barely dares to say.</p><p>“I’m sorry,” Rio whispers. “I’m sure that’s not what you want to hear, I just don’t want to be dishonest. Not with you.”</p><p>“Of course it’s what I want to hear,” Agatha says, afraid of her own feelings but refusing to be a coward. Not when Rio’s being so raw and honest with her. “You honestly don’t think I want you to have feelings for me, Rio? I want you to have all the feelings. I want you to fall head over heels in love with me so you’ll never want to walk away.”</p><p>Rio whimpers, picking her head up, fierce brown eyes staring directly into Agatha’s. Directly into her soul, it feels like. “I don’t know what love feels like, but if it’s wanting to be around someone every single second and feeling like you’re gonna die when they’re not next to you, then this is it.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes are burning, tears tracking down her cheeks as they stare at each other, and she’s never felt so vulnerable in her life. She brings her hands up to hold Rio’s face, resting their foreheads together. “That’s what it feels like,” she whispers. “And I love you too.”</p>
