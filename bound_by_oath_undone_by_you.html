<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rio Vidal had always strived for perfection. When she was in the Marine Corps, it was perfection. When she made the Special Forces program, it was perfection. When she was offered a job as a top tier Secret Service agent, it was her drive for perfection that got her there.</p><p>And now at 38 years old, she had climbed the ranks high enough to be head of personal security for the President of the United States of America. Except this time, it was bigger. This time is required more perfection.</p><p>The whole world was watching when Agatha Harkness raised her hand and took the oath of office. And Rio was standing off in the corner, watching her with a marked precision before scanning the area. But her eyes couldn’t stay off the new President for long.</p><p>Agatha Harkness. A former senator with a reputation for cutting deals in smoke-filled rooms, never blinking under pressure, for winning – always one might add – she had stormed into the Presidency like a hurricane on heels.</p><p>There had never been a more qualified candidate. President Harkness had served in all branches of government, serving as an unbeatable prosecuting attorney, working to the attorney general of Massachusetts before running for the Senate. She paved ways for millions of women, protecting minority identities with a fierceness that even made the stoic Rio Vidal shudder.</p><p>The press called her calculating. Her opponents called her ruthless. Her supporters called her brilliant.</p><p>Behind closed doors, Agatha called it what it was: survival.</p><p>For Agent Vidal, newly assigned to her protection detail, the job was simple. Keep the president alive. Keep her schedule tight. Keep the chaos out. Even if to some Agatha Harkness was the definition of cold, calculated, chaos.</p><p>Nothing about Agatha Harkness was simple. Not the way she walked into a room like she owned it. Not the way her eyes flickered over you, like she was reading you as easily as an open book. And not in the way she smiled, slow, sharp, and just a little too knowing. Like every one of your secrets was in the palm of her hand.</p><p>The ceremony was over quickly, the January weather on this DC morning sending everyone freezing to their cars. Rio had yet to formally meet President Harkness, being reassigned to her detail this morning after an emergency. But she took it in stride.</p><p>Which led to now, with Marine 1 landing on the lawn of the White House. Rio stood at the ready, waiting for Madam President to step out, quickly moving into position next to her, an arm ghosting over her back.</p><p>“Madam President I am your new head of personal security, Special Agent Rio Vidal.” Rio introduced herself with practice eased, her voice calm as she led Agatha inside. “Agent Vidal nice to meet you.”</p><p>Agatha gave her that simple smile, something that was more amused than anything else. Rio nodded back leading Agatha inside the White House with practiced ease. Alice fell into step behind them, Agatha’s newly appointed Chief of Staff Jennifer Kale.</p><p>“Kale what time is the inauguration ball tonight?” Agatha asked in that cool tone. The pair started speaking as Rio and Alice, her partner for this shift, followed them through the hallway.</p><p>Rio had walked these corridors before, but never like this – never shadowing the most powerful woman in the world, never with the weight of the nation hanging on every breath she took. Agatha continued walking ahead of her, heels sharp against the marble floor, shoulders back, head held high.</p><p>Her and Jen continued talking about the upcoming events for tonight as they reached the Oval Office, Rio and Alice splitting to cover the two doors. Aides scattered at the sight of them, knowing better than to interrupt the newly inaugurated President when she had that gleam in her eye. Agatha waved them off telling them to go get lunch and turned to Rio, facing her fully for the first time.</p><p>For a heartbeat, Agatha studied her with a look Rio couldn’t decipher, almost like Rio was prey and Agatha was an apex predator.</p><p>Rio saw the sharp intelligence in Agatha’s eyes, the glimmer of amusement dancing just beneath. She also saw the exhaustion, the weight of the day pulling at the corners of her mouth, the faintest tightness in her shoulders.</p><p>“Agent Vidal,” Agatha said in a tone that almost made Rio shiver, “I assume you’ve been briefed on the general threats I face?” She raised her eyebrow as Jen chuckled at her antics. “Yes, ma’am.” Rio responded, her voice low like honey.</p><p>“Then you know how long the list is.” Agatha responded, eyebrow raised before she turned to Alice. “And you, Agent?” Alice smiled, “Agent Alice Wu-Gulliver Madam President. And yes, your entire personal team has been briefed.” Agatha nodded her head at the introduction before she turned her gaze to Rio again narrowing her eyes.</p><p>A woman as the first president of the most powerful military nation, was bound to have its enemies. Name the conservative Rodgers campaign currently claiming that the election was rigged, and currently still calling for Agatha’s head. A woman in power was a dangerous thing to them.</p><p>“So, you know how long the list is?” A statement, Agatha was testing Rio. A ghost of a smirk graced her face. “I’ve seen longer, Madam President.” Agatha arched a brow, clearly intrigued. “Oh?” Rio gave a faint smile, the barest flicker at the corner of her mouth.</p><p>“I was with a diplomatic team in Kabul, ma’am. And again, in Bogotá.” Rio held Agatha’s gaze, the icy blue eyes reading her as if she were an open book. “Ah,” Agatha nodded eyes never leaving Rio’s, “A woman with scars.”</p><p>Rio didn’t flinch, finally letting the smile peek through as she held Agatha’s challenging gaze. “A woman who knows how to keep you alive,” Rio paused before continuing, “A woman who knows how to keep you alive.”</p><p>For a moment the room was silent, Jen and Alice’s watching the silent sparring match. Rio took a deep breath, the perfume coming off Agatha from the small space. It was something dark, expensive, with a hint of spice.</p><p>Agatha smiled slowly. “Good I would like it to stay that way.”</p><p>Jen cleared her throat, breaking the moment as Agatha turned to look at the iPad she was holding. Rio looking across the room at Alice who only have her a warning look. Rio might be fucked.</p><p>--</p><p>The next few hours were a blur of meetings, photo ops, and briefings. Rio shadowed every move, barely blinking, earpiece humming in her ear. And yet, even with the whirlwind of activity, she kept catching those little glances. Agatha looking over her shoulder during a call. Agatha, half-smiling when Rio would enter a room across from her. Agatha giving her a challenging look from across the room when their eyes would meet.</p><p>Rio had banned herself from looking at the President. The woman made her feel this strange feeling in her chest, maybe it was just that the representation women deserved was here. The person who would fight for minority rights had made it into office.</p><p>By the time the day wound down, Rio was exhausted – but Agatha? She looked like she was just getting started. They were headed into the residential quarters, Alice stopping at the entrance as Rio showed her to her room.</p><p>“Here is your room ma’am.” Agatha only hummed, before speaking. “Walk with me Agent,” Agatha murmured as she continued into the room, heading straight for the balcony. Rio hesitated for a split second before deciding to follow.</p><p>The cold January air bit at them, but Agatha didn’t seem to mind. She leaned against the stone railing, eyes scanning the dark city beyond. “It’s a strange thing,” she said quietly, “standing here. Knowing the world is watching. Knowing every word, every choice, every breath is dissected and twisted and spun.”</p><p>Rio stood a respectful distance behind her, hands folded in front. “Comes with the job ma’am.” Agatha let out a soft laugh. “Yes but no one tells you what is feels like.” There was a beat of silence between them, the cold air swirling.</p><p>“Tell me Agent Vidal,” Agatha said softly into the night, not turning to look at Rio, “What do you think of me?” Rio stiffened slightly. “Madam President?”</p><p>“I’ve read your file,” Agatha murmured. “I know you’re thorough. Precise. You don’t miss details. So,” Agatha tuned, eyes glittering in the low light, “What do you think?” Rio held her ground. “I think you are brilliant, ma’am. I think you’re dangerous to an even more dangerous set of beliefs. And I think that you are exactly what this country needs right now.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile turned sharp. “Dangerous, huh?”</p><p>Rio met her gaze evenly, something smoldering in both of their eyes. “Yes, Ma’am.” Agatha stepped closer, only a few feet away now. “And does that scare you, Agent Vidal?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened, her heartbeat loud in her ears for a reason she wasn’t willing to acknowledge yet. “No, ma’am.” Agatha studied her for a long moment, eyes flickering over her face, as if trying to peel back every layer. Then, slowly, she smiled – soft, dangerous, knowing.</p><p>“Good.” She said, her voice firm and much calmer than Rio felt on the inside, “Because I think we are going to have a very interesting time together.” Rio let a smile grace her face at this. “I am sure Madam President. If you will excuse me, I must go direct security change.” Rio have her one last smile and nod, her suit jacket suddenly feeling too tight as she strode through the residence.</p><p>She wasn’t easily rattled. Years of combat, of field assignments, of dangerous missions had hardened her into something steady, something unshakable. But Agatha Harkness? She was something else entirely.</p><p>Every glance, every word, every little tilt of her head carried weight. It was like she saw right through Rio – like she was playing a game Rio hadn’t even realized she’d been invited too.</p><p>“Agent Vidal.” Rio heard Agatha’s voice right as she reached the door, turning to see the older woman in the dimly lit room with a knowing smile on her face. “Make sure you get some good rest; I want to go running in the morning.”</p><p>Rio nodded reaching for the door handle. “Yes Ma’am.” Rio swallowed forcing herself to hold the steady, unreadable expression. Agatha’s smile deepened – not cruel, not kind, just… knowing.</p><p>“Good night, Agent.” Agatha spoke in that tone Rio couldn’t place yet. She nodded before opening the door and slipping back into the hallway, her heart beating just a little too fast.</p><p>--</p><p>The next morning, before dawn had even hinted at the Washington skyline, Rio Vidal stood outside the private residence doors, dressed in black tactical joggers, a long-sleeved Secret Service training shirt, and lightweight runners.</p><p>The official schedule said the President had an early intelligence briefing at 7:30am followed by back-to-back meetings until noon. But before all that – before the motorcade rolled out, before the press corps swarmed, before the West Wing staff descended with their armfuls of papers and demands – Agatha Harkness wanted a run.</p><p>The morning was cold, even by D.C.’s January standards, when Rio Vidal waited outside the residence doors, breath steady in the frost. She checked her watch. 5:59am.</p><p>Next to her Alice Wu-Gulliver gave a small yawn she tried to hide behind her gloved hand. “You really think she’s going to come running, or is this some power-play test for the new detail lead?”</p><p>Rio gave a faint shake of her head. “Both.”</p><p>Alice smiled and laughed lightly, raising a brow an impressed look on her face. “If she makes it more than a mile in this weather that woman is capable of anything.”</p><p>Before Rio could answer, the door opened. President Harkness stepped out, dark sweatpants, sleek charcoal running top, with a beanie and hair pulled back in a simple braid. She moved like someone who expected you to keep up or get left behind.</p><p>“Morning, Agent Vidal. Agent Wu,” Agatha greeted smoothly, eyes glinting with the hint of a smirk as she scanned the other five agents behind them. “Ready?” She stretched before starting into a slow jogging pace.</p><p>“Always, Madam President.” Rio answered as she fell into step right next to her as Alice and the other five agents formed a box around the new President. Alice trotted slightly behind, staying close.</p><p>As they moved off down the private path looping around the South Lawn, the cold bit at their faces, but the adrenaline was warm. “All of you are trained in mixed martial arts, right?” Agatha asked causally over her shoulder as they picked up the pace. Alice made a small choking sound. Rio to her credit, answered flatly, “Yes Ma’am.”</p><p>“Good,” Agatha murmured, a little amused smile at the corners of her mouth. “Jennifer insisted I double-check after the Secret Service incident on the campaign trail.” Jennifer Kale. Chief of Staff. She’d briefed Rio thoroughly last night after Rio left the residence. Jennifer didn’t miss details – and she didn’t trust people around Agatha without layers of vetting.</p><p>They fell into a steady rhythm. The world was just starting to stir frost on the grass, Secret Service patrols quietly sweeping, a few senior West Wing staff already arriving. Alice huffed lightly beside them, half-jogging, half-chatting softly over the comms, scheming in with the outer perimeter agents.</p><p>Rio kept her eyes sharp, scanning the tree lines, the rooftops, the long sweep of the lawn. But inevitable – every few strides – Rio felt the weighted gaze of the President on her. Agatha ran like she negotiated, smooth, controlled, making you feel like you were the on working to keep up. Stripping control from those around her.</p><p>“I read your file.” Agatha said lightly, her eyes flicking over with a glint of something. “Former Marine, former Special Forces, top-tier security record. You don’t lose focus. You don’t miss details. You don’t get rattled.” Rio stayed quiet, the sound of their steps the only noise.</p><p>Agatha smiled faintly. “I like that.” Which should not have made heat rush down Rio’s spine the way it did.</p><p>Alice snorted behind them. “That’s the President’s way of saying you’re already under her microscope.” Agatha laughed low and amused, “I don’t need a microscope, Agent Wu. Just good instincts.” Rio smiled lightly as she continued running, eyes forward as they scanned everywhere as Agatha continued to push them faster.</p><p>They slowed after two miles, breath clouding the cold air. Agatha rolled her shoulders, stretching her neck. “Walk me through today, Agent Vidal,” she said, like it was nothing, like this wasn’t a test.</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate, “9 a.m. security briefing with Intelligence Director Woo and National Security Advisor Rambeau. 10:30 meeting with Chief of Staff Kale and Defense liaison Elsa Bloodstone on the Eastern Europe package. Lunch with the UN delegation at one. Afternoon block for classified briefings, plus the environmental committee at four.”</p><p>Agatha raised an eyebrow. “Sharp.” Rio gave a faint nod. “It’s my job, ma’am.” Agatha smiled again – that slow knowing curve that seemed to tug at the edge of Rio’s carefully built discipline. “It’s impressive.”</p><p>--</p><p>Back inside the resident, Jennifer Kale was already waiting near the private study, tablet in hand, eyes sharp. She wore a tailored navy suit, poised and ready for business.</p><p>“Morning run complete, Madam President?” Jennifer asked briskly. “Complete.” Agatha confirmed, pulling off her gloves. “Anything on fire yet?”</p><p>“No fires. But Monica Rambeau is here early – she wants five minutes before the formal security briefing. Agatha exchanged a quick look with Rio. “Clear her through?” Agatha moved towards her room to get ready for the day.</p><p>Rio gave a curt nod. “Already on it, ma’am.”</p><p>By the time Monica Rambeau arrived at the front – trim black suit, dark hair in clean twist, portfolio tucked under one arm – Rio was at the elevator flanked by Alice dressed in their all-black tight-fitting suits, white shirts underneath and earpieces back in.</p><p>“Agent Vidal,” Monica greeted smoothly, extending her hand. “Glad to finally meet you.”</p><p>“Advisor Rambeau.” Rio nodded, shaking firmly.</p><p>As they moved toward the study, Alice murmured softly near Rio’s shoulder, “The National Security Advisor moves like she’s got sex crises lined up behind her.” Rio’s mouth twitched, just slightly, “She probably does.”</p><p>They reached the brief room quickly, and the day kicked into motion.</p><p>Jennifer ran point, toggling between updates on Senate negotiations, foreign policy prep, and upcoming defense reviews. Jimmy Woo’s intelligence reports hit the president’s desk by midmorning, dense with cybersecurity updates, foreign surveillance notes, and potential domestic threats. Elsa Bloodstone, sharp and uncompromising, came in with a detailed contractor review, laser-focused on tightening defense readiness.</p><p>The president moved through it all with smooth, cutting efficiency – listening, questioning, adjusting, commanding. And yet, every so often, her gaze would flick – briefly, almost absentmindedly – toward Rio.</p><p>It was subtle.</p><p>But Rio felt it every time like lava being poured over her.</p><p>--</p><p>By late afternoon, Rio stood outside the Oval Office as Agatha wrapped up a final call. Alice leaned against the wall nearby, scrolling through the latest security logs.</p><p>“You are settling in?” Alice asked quietly. Rio nodded, “Getting there.” Alice smirked, “She’s intense, huh?”</p><p>Rio gave a slow exhaled. “That’s one word for it.”</p><p>Agatha hung up the phone, standing from her desk. She paused just long enough to let her eye’s meet Rio’s – a flicker of something, maybe amusement, maybe calculation, maybe curiosity. She moved around the desk, Alice opening the door for her as she exited, Alice and Rio falling into step behind her.</p><p>“You said you’re trained in mixed martial arts earlier,” Agatha said, eyes forward as she navigated her way to the residence, “Will you train with me?” Rio and Alice exchanged glances before Rio responded. “Of course, Madam President” Rio said falling into step beside her.</p><p>“I should like to start tomorrow; my schedule is clear around noon.” Rio nodded, “Yes ma’am.” They reached the residence doors. For a beat, Agatha lingered, turning to face the Agent’s gaze resting on Rio’s face. “I think we are going to work well together, Agent Vidal.” She said softly almost like a promise before turning to Alice, “Same with you Agent Wu.”</p><p>Rio held her posture steady, even as something sparked low in her chest – a flicker of heat, of pull, of the kind of dangerous tension she usually buried deep under layers of training.</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Rio said evenly, “I think so too.”</p><p>For the first time in years, Rio Vidal felt something str inside her that had nothing to do with duty, or discipline, or perfection.</p><p>Something that had everything to do with the woman she had just promised to protect.</p><p>--</p><p>The private gym under the White House hummed softly – the whir of fans, the faint slap of mats, and the occasional low grunt or exhale.</p><p>Rio Vidal stood barefoot on the training mat, loose black athletic pants hugging her hips, a fitted compression tank outlining her solid shoulders and muscular frame. At 5’9” and 39 years old, she carried her strength with quiet ease: toned biceps, firm abs, the kind of build that made people instinctively step aside when she walked through the room.</p><p>Across from her, the President of the United States stretched out her arms, rolling her shoulders.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was … striking. Rio was not blind.</p><p>At 55, she wore her age not like a burden but like a weapon – confidence carved deep into her sharp, elegant features. Wild, curly brown hair streaked with silver framed her face in a mane of deliberate chaos, and icy blue eyes sparkled with that ever-present, knowing glint. She stood at 5’7”, curvy yet toned, the kind of woman who owned the space she walked into.</p><p>And now, she was watching Rio with a smirk that made Rio’s stomach tighten just a little too much.</p><p>“Madam President,” Rio began, tone brisk and profession, “remember, we’re running though jiu-jitsu techniques today for body control and self-defense. Alice will partner you first, then I’ll rotate in.”</p><p>Alice shot a grin from where she crouched nearby, tightening her gloves. “Ready to throw me around ma’am?” Agatha raised a brow. “You know, Agent Wu, you might regret the invitation.”</p><p>They circled each other. Despite the light tone, there was nothing casual about the way Agatha moved – balanced, sharp, focused.</p><p>Rio felt her pulse quicken. She hadn’t expected this. Most protected were stiff of clumsy when asked to train. But Agatha? She knew exactly what she was doing.</p><p>Alice lunged slightly – testing, probing – and Agatha slid under, twisting her opponent’s balance and driving her to the mat with swift, efficient control. “Whoa,” Alice grunted, breathless but laughing. “You’ve done this before.”</p><p>Agatha offered her a hand up, her grin edged with amusement. “What can I say? I hate being underestimated.” From the sideline, Rio couldn’t stop the faint curve of a smile at the corner of her mouth. Of course she was good.</p><p>“Alright, Madam President,” Rio said, voice smooth but clipped, “my turn.”</p><p>Agatha gave a slow smile, rising to her feet lightly and offering Alice a hand up. “I was wondering when you’d stop making me play with your agents and come test me yourself.” Rio ticked her jaw, refraining from the way that made her feel.</p><p>They moved to the center of the mat, barefoot, standing in the sharp light. Alice leaned against the wall, arms crossed, grinning as she watched. “Don’t hold back Rio,” Alice called, “She’s tougher than she looks.”</p><p>Rio stretched one arm, feeling the pull along her bicep. She was hyperaware, suddenly, of Agatha’s eyes flickering over her – from her sculpted shoulders to the tight line of her abs beneath the thin blank tank top.</p><p>Agatha Harkness had been watching Rio all morning. And now Rio was about to give her a show. “Ready?” Rio asked softly. “More than ready, Agent Vidal.”</p><p>They circled each other, Agatha’s stance ready, weight balanced on the balls of her feet, hands up. She moved lightly, easily – not with brute strength, but with a cat-like grace honed by years of practice. Rio watched her carefully, heart beating just a little faster.</p><p>They clashed -quick and sharp. Agatha shot low, testing Rio’s balance. Rio shifted, blocking smoothly, using her superior strength to redirect the move. But Agatha was fast. In a flash, she pivoted twisting under Rio’s arm, slipping behind her in a move that caught Rio by surprise.</p><p>Rio chuckled, “Clever.”</p><p>Agatha murmured from behind her, breath ghosting over Rio’s ear, “Oh you have no idea.”</p><p>They separated quickly, Rio fighting to hide the goosebumps that racked her body from the President’s boldness.</p><p>Rio feinted a sweep and Agatha caught it, twisting with elegant precision. Their bodies met, pressed close. Rio could feel the sharp curve of Agatha’s hip against hers, the faint catches of the President’s breath, the flex of her toned arms as she fought to stay upright.</p><p>For a split second, they locked eyes.</p><p>Icy blue met deep, rich brown. Something heated flickered between them as Rio let go like Agatha was on fire. She swallowed hard, “You’re strong.” She murmured. Agatha smirked faintly. “You’re just noticing that now?”</p><p>They circled each other again Rio focused on Agatha with calculated precision.</p><p>Rio lunged, trying a throw – but Agatha twisted smoothly, slipping under, her hands sliding across Rio’s shoulder, bracing, and then pulling. The move drives them both down- Rio half-twisted, Agatha straddling her waist, pinning her briefly with surprising control.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched. Agatha leaned in, face inches from hers pretending like the was moving to subdue Rio further, a slow wicked smile ghosting her lips as she said, “Pinned, Agent Vidal?”</p><p>Rio let out a sound that was almost a low growl. “Don’t get cocky, Madam President.” With a surge, she shifted her weight, sliding one arm under Agatha’s grip, twisting. Suddenly they were rolling, tangled together, bodies pressed close, breath mingling, muscles straining as they fought for dominance.</p><p>Rio could feel everything – the curve of Agatha’s thigh against hers, the brush of wild curls against her neck, the faint, sharp sound of Agatha’s laughter against her ear. It was too much. Too close. Too hot.</p><p>Rio flipped them smoothly, pinning Agatha back to the mat, one strong hand braced beside her head, chest heaving. Agatha’s icy blue eyes sparkled up at her, sharp and amused and something else – something softer, warmer.</p><p>“You’re good,” Agatha murmured softly. Rio’s voice came out low, almost rough as her eyes flickered to Agatha’s lips before snapping back up to her eyes. “So are you.”</p><p>For a heartbeat night of them moved. Rio could feel the pulse racing under Agatha’s skin. She could see the faint flush rising in the older woman’s cheeks, the sharp gleam in her eyes.</p><p>She wanted –</p><p>No.</p><p>Alice cleared her throat laughing, “I think that is the first time I have seen someone give Rio a run for her money.” Rio shook herself out of the daze drawing a deep steadying breath, pushing herself up and off, standing quickly and offering a hand down. “We should cool down, Madam President.” Agatha’s smile curved slow and knowing. “Of course, Agent Vidal.”</p><p>As they stretched side by side, Rio tried to calm the storm still roiling inside her. She was a profession. She was here to protect Agatha, not fall into this dangerous, magnetic pull.</p><p>And yet.</p><p>Every time Agatha’s cool blue gaze flicked toward her, every time the President’s elegant fingers brushed lightly past hers, every time that sharp, knowing smile curved those perfect lips –</p><p>Rio fell herself unraveling, bit by bit.</p><p>Agatha Harkness was going to be the end of her.</p><p>And she didn’t know if she even wanted to stop it.</p>

<p>The White House was never quiet, not truly.</p><p>Even in the soft stretch of early morning, when the corridors were dimly lit and aides scurried past only in quiet pairs, the place thrummed with the hum of machinery, the shuffle of security, the undercurrent of a nation’s weight.</p><p>Rio Vidal moved through the West Wing with the fluid, confident step of someone who knew every inch of the ground she walked on. Her fitted navy-blue suit clung to her as she adjusted the cuff. The morning light caught the deep chocolate brown of her eyes as they scanned the hall, sharp and alert beneath her dark brows. She was already two steps ahead of the day.</p><p>The earpiece nestled snugly inside her ear crackled faintly. Agent Wu’s clear, smooth voice came through, “South entrance clear. Motorcade still ten minutes out.”</p><p>“Copy,” Rio murmured, tapping her mic in rhythm with her steps.</p><p>The President was due to meet with Secretary of State Lilia Calderu shortly – one of many delicate diplomatic conversations on the schedule today. Rio’s mind ran through the details, reviewing the intelligence she had been briefed on this morning.</p><p>Eastern Europe tensions had escalated again, with covert operations rumored on both sides of the border. The stakes in this meeting were high – discussing sanctions, military posturing, fragile alliances – all balanced on the edge of fragile diplomacy.</p><p>William Kaplan, Agatha’s whip-smart, fresh-faced assistant, was already buzzing for updates as she approached the Oval Office. His texts had been coming in like rapid fire, each one with a small jolt of caffeine to Rio’s carefully measured calm.</p><p>William was sharp and brilliant – barely thirty, and organization genius and completely unfazed by the sheer chaos of working for Agatha Harkness. She admired that in him, even if his youthful energy grated against Rio’s calculated calm.</p><p>“Agent Vidal,” William’s voice floated softly from the end of the hall, where he leaned against the doorway of the Roosevelt Room. His tablet was clutched in one hand, his blazer slightly rumpled from lake of sleep, and his tie a little loose from the long morning. “She’s finishing a call. Secretary Calderu’s arrival is five minutes.”</p><p>Rio gave him a small nod, brushing past him toward the private door that led into the Oval Office.</p><p>Inside, Agatha Harkness stood by the window, her wild, curly brown hair loosely pinned back, the soft tendrils framing a face that was both sharp and tired. Her sleek black suit hugged her toned and curvy frame – a silhouetted of power wrapped in poise.</p><p>She spoke briskly into the phone, one hand gesturing slightly as she tracked notes on papers spready across her desk.</p><p>Icy blue eyes flicked up as Rio entered.</p><p>Their gazes met. And for a beat, the air tightened.</p><p>It had been a week since the sparring session in the gym – a week of tense glances, clipped conversations, and Rio’s increasingly impossible efforts to shove the magnetic pull of the President into a neat profession box.</p><p>Agatha’s intensity always seemed to catch Rio off guard, like she was a force of nature wrapped in silk, simultaneously a tempest and a calm sea. “Get back to me with that report Mark.” Agatha spoke, her tone making Rio’s knees almost weak.</p><p>Agatha hung up smoothly, turning towards Rio with that sharp smile – the one that was both a challenge and invitation. “Agent Vidal.”</p><p>“Madam President.” Rio inclined her head taking her position next to the door.</p><p>“Still standing.” Agatha stated her eyes flickering over Rio.</p><p>“Always Ma’am.” A ghost of a smirk made its way onto Rio’s face at the insinuation. There was something in the way Agatha watched her – sharp, testing, amused. Like she was reading a page Rio hadn’t written yet.</p><p>“Secretary Calderu is here, ma’am.” Rio reported calmly Alice announcing the arrival through her earpiece. “Awesome thank you Agent.” Agatha spoke moving to sit at the desk.</p><p>The door swung open, and Lilia Calderu swept into the Oval Office. Like Agatha’s, her hair was streaked with grey, framing a face that was moth composed and inscrutable. Her deep voice carried the steady, diplomatic weight that made her one of the most effective Secretaries of State in modern history – a woman who knew the game and played it with ruthless grace.</p><p>As if Agatha would accept anything else in her cabinet.</p><p>“Madam President,” Lilia greeted smoothly, shaking Agatha’s hand firmly. “It’s good to see you.” Rio stood silently by the door watching. “Lilia,” Agatha smiled faintly. “Always.”</p><p>Rio moved back, standing at the edge of the room, her body a coiled spring of readiness. She observed every subtle gesture – the most imperceptible tightening of Lilia’s jaw, the way Agatha’s eyes flicker briefly toward the window.</p><p>The topic was the rising tension in Eastern Europe, a volatile mix of border disputes, cyber-attacks, and shadow diplomacy. Agatha’s voice was calm but firm as she laid out the United States’ positions to Lilia – cautious, measured, yet unwavering support of democratic allies.</p><p>Lilia responded, weaving between threats and promises, leverage and compromise. “I spoke with General Lazarev last night.” Lilia said softly, her hands folded. “He insists their troop movements are defensive.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile tightened. “And you believe him?”</p><p>“Madam President, I’ve known Lazarev for twenty years. I believe he <em>thinks</em> they’re defensive. But I also believe his government’s chessboard is wider than even he sees.”</p><p>William Kaplan slipped quietly into the room, his tablet glowing softly in his hands. He handed a fresh file to Rio as he passed, eyes flickering to hers with a polite, harried smile before he darted back out.</p><p>Rio glanced at the file, the words ‘possible insider threat’ and ‘compromised channels’ jumping out immediately. Her heartbeat quickened before she steeled herself into a calm presence. The conversation stretched on – subtle, intricate, the kind of high-level talk Rio was used to tuning out.</p><p>When Agatha laughed softly – a rich, warm sound that seemed to fill the room like sunlight – Rio felt it, sharp as a blade along her spine and in her chest.</p><p>
<em>You need to get your head on straight, Vidal.</em>
</p><p>--</p><p>Hours later, after tense meetings, delicate negotiations, and the grinding weight of statecraft, Rio found herself once again outside the President’s private study. “Go take a break, Rio.” Alice urged quietly, nudging her shoulder as she passed. “You’ve been on all day.”</p><p>“I am good.” Rio spoke surely, “I’ll check on her first and then meet shift change. I will meet you in the gym.” Alice gave her a knowing glance but let it drop. Rio waited to be alone in the hallway, then lifted her hand and knocked softly.</p><p>“Come in,” Agatha’s voice called.</p><p>The room was dimly lit, the city lights outside casting gold and blue across the carpet. Agatha sat barefoot by the window, curled into an armchair, a glass of bourbon resting on the table beside her. Her suit jacket was draped over the chair, sleeves of her blouse rolled up, curls tumbling loose from their pin.</p><p>She looked every inch the formidable woman Rio protected – and something else, something more vulnerable, more human.</p><p>“Agent Vidal,” Agatha greeted her softly with a smile.</p><p>“Just checking to make sure you’re settled for the evening, ma’am.” Rio said, her voice low and careful. Agatha’s lips curved faintly. “Yes, I am good for the evening. Ever diligent.” Agatha responded with a teasing tone.</p><p>Rio shifted slightly, “It’s part of the job, ma’am.” Agatha’s gaze sharpened. “Is it?” There was a stretch of silence.</p><p>“You weren’t always Secret Service,” Agatha murmured, rising to her feet slowly, crossing the room. “MARSOC? Special operations. I read your file.”</p><p>Rio’s shoulders stiffened, “As you’ve mentioned,” there was a brief pause as Agatha approached like she was stalking prey, “ma’am.” Rio finished swallowing.</p><p>“And before that – foster homes, three siblings, raised mostly on your own after seventeen.” Agatha’s voice softened, curiosity lacing through it. “You don’t let many people close, do you?”</p><p>Rio’s throat tightened. “I prefer to keep things professional, ma’am.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile turned sly as she stepped closer. “I’ve noticed.”</p><p>She stepped closer, close enough that Rio could catch the faint scent of her – something warm, sharp, and faintly floral. Agatha tilted her head, studying Rio like she was trying to solve a puzzle.</p><p>“What is it that makes you stay, Agent Vidal?” Agatha asked softly. Rio looked down meeting her gaze evenly, “Because someone like you is worth protecting ma’am.” Rio’s voice was lower than she expected it to be, and she watched as Agatha’s eyes darkened.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched – just barely. Her hand lifted, brushing lightly against Rio’s sleeve. The touch was brief, feather-light, but it crackled between them like livewire. And Rio felt it <em>everywhere</em>.</p><p>“Do you ever wonder,” Agatha murmured her voice dropping lower, “what would happen if you stopped pretending this was just a job?”</p><p>Rio swallowed hard. Her heart thundered against her ribs. “Ma’am,” she said softly, firmly, “with respect… that’s a dangerous question.” Agatha’s blue eyes glittered as she looked up at Rio, fixing the lapel of her suit jacket.</p><p>“Dangerous doesn’t scare me, Agent Vidal.” For a moment they both stood locked in a quiet standoff – two powerful women bound by duty, desire, and a thousand invisible lines they weren’t supposed to cross.</p><p>Then, with a sharp, knowing smile, Agatha stepped back.</p><p>“Good night, Agent Vidal.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly. “Goodnight, ma’am.”</p><p>As she stepped out into the hallway, heart still pounding, Rio knew one thing for certain: no matter how hard she tried the clash was inevitable.</p><p>--</p><p>Rio had handled the shift change and strode right to the gym. It was buried deep in the basement, a sleek, reinforced space where Secret Service agents trained long after the public had gone to sleep.</p><p>At this late hour, the gym was nearly empty except for the rhythmic thud of gloves striking pads, the sharp breath of exertion, and the low hum of music spilling from a speaker tucked on a shelf. Alice ducked a punch, grinning as Rio Vidal came at her fast.</p><p>“Come on, Vidal, you can hit harder than that,” Alice taunted, her voice light despite the sweat slicking her dark hair back. She pivoted on her heel, blocking a sharp jab and throwing a swift counterpunch that Rio easily deflected.</p><p>Rio smirked, circling. “You sure you want to poke that bear, Alice?” Alice flashed a grin, “Oh I am counting on it.” Her eyes were sharp with challenge.</p><p>The two women moved with fluid precision, their bodies familiar with the dance of combat. Rio was taller, lean muscle honed by years of military service, her dark eyes laser-focused, every motion measured and efficient.</p><p>Alice, quicker on her feet, favored speed and agility, darting in and out with lightning-quick strikes, her compact frame coiled with energy. They trained together often, but tonight Rio seemed distracted.</p><p>“You have been tense all week,” Alice said, between breaths, dodging a hook. “Want to talk about it?”</p><p>“Not really,” Rio grunted, driving forward with a rapid combo that forced Alice back a step. “Let me guess,” Alice panted, blocking. “President Harkness?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened. That half-flicker of a second was all Alice needed. “Ha! Nailed it,” Alice teased, dancing out of reach. “You’ve got it bad Vidal.” Rio stopped abruptly, pulling back. “This is not a conversation we are having Alice.”</p><p>Alice lowered her gloves slightly, her teasing smile softening. “Hey look, I’m your friend. I’m not judging. But you can’t keep bottling this up.” Rio exhaled hard, wiping a gloved hand across her forehead. “It’s complicated.”</p><p>Alice stepped closer, dropping her voice. “It’s only complicated because you make it complicated. She’s clearly into you.” Rio gave her a sharp look, “Careful Wu-Gulliver.”</p><p>Alice raised her hands in mock surrender. “Fine, fine. I’m just saying – you’re allowed to be human too Rio. There was a beat of silence as Rio flexed her fists, tension crackling under her skin.</p><p>Without warning, she launched forward, gloves up, striking hard. Alice laughed, exhilarated, dodging and weaving, their bodies colliding in controlled ferocity. The sound of fists striking pads echoed through the gym.</p><p>Minutes later, they collapsed onto the mats, breathing hard, sweat streaking their skin. Alice sprawled out, arms flung wide, staring up at the ceiling. “Damn, Vidal, you’re going to kill me one of these days.”</p><p>Rio sat cross-legged, pulling off her gloves, flexing her fingers. “You started it.” Alice rolled her head to the side, watching her. “You’re not just fighting me tonight. You’re fighting yourself.” Rio didn’t respond immediately. She picked at the laces of her gloves, her brow furrowed.</p><p>“I’ve been doing this job a long time,” Rio said finally, her voice low. “You don’t… get involved. You can’t afford it.” She paused before continuing, “Besides she is a woman, the media would flay her alive if they found out she had a relationship with an Agent.”</p><p>“Yeah, well tell that to your heart Vidal” Alice propped herself up on her elbows. “You sound like a damn movie cliché.” Rio let out a soft, humorless laugh as she reached over pushing Alice lightly. Alice grinned. “What can I say? I’ve got range.”</p><p>They sat in companionable silence for a moment, the sounds of the gym fading to the quiet thrum of the building around them. Finally, Alice pushed herself up fully, reaching for her water bottle. “Look, you don’t have to tell me anything. But maybe… just maybe… you should tell her.” Rio looked at her with that cutting gaze.</p><p>“It’s not that simple.” Alice’s expression softened, “I know.” Rio stared at the floor, her hands resting loosely on her knees. “I can’t be the one who breaks the line,” Rio said quietly. “She’s the President. There is too much at stake.”</p><p>Alice studied her for a long moment. “Yeah,” She murmured. “But maybe she’s already standing on the line, waiting for you.” The weight of those words settled heavily between them. Rio ran a hand through her damp hair, closing her eyes briefly.</p><p>“I just don’t know how to stop,” She whispered. “I don’t know how to let myself want it.” Alice reached out, squeezing her shoulder gently. “Then maybe start by admitting you do.”</p><p>Outside the White House loomed silent and gleaming, and somewhere inside a President say awake by the window, her thoughts fixed not on policy or power, but in the woman who stands between her and the world.</p><p>--</p><p>The pale gold of awn stretched over the White House grounds as Rio Vidal tightened the laces of her running shows. She adjusted her black Secret Service tactical outfit and exhaled slowly, watching her breath curl faintly in the cool air.  Beside her, Alice bounced lightly on the balls of her feet, radiating energy despite the early hour.</p><p>“You ready?” Alice teased, pulling her hair into a neat ponytail. Her dark eyes sparkled with mischief. “Because if she runs anything like she did the last time, I am going to need a head start.” Rio shot her a sideways glance. “Stay focused, Alice. It’s a run, not a competition.”</p><p>“Oh, come on. You know you’re as curious as I am.” Alice grinned, nudging Rio with her elbow. “Madam President’s athletic. She kicked my ass in sparring and has outrun most agents on her morning runs. That’s why we’re here and everyone is spread out for protection. She made you work for it too.”</p><p>Before Rio could answer, the side door opened, and Agatha Harkness emerged. She wore sleek black running leggings and a dark gray zip-up jacket with the presidential seal. Her wavy brown hair pulled back into a loose knot.</p><p>Even at dawn, even in casual clothes, Agatha carried herself like she owned every inch of ground under her feet. And she was breathtaking. “Good morning, Agents.” Agatha called smoothly, a faint smile playing on her lips.</p><p>“Morning, ma’am,” Alice chimed brightly, offering a half-salute. “Madam President.” Rio said more formally, inclining her head.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes sparkled with amusement. “Let’s not be too formal out here, Agent Vidal. After all, we’re just going for a jog.”</p><p>They set off across the South Lawn, feet crunching lightly on the gravel path. Rio automatically took the lead, her eyes sweeping over the grounds with practiced focus, but she could feel Agatha’s presence close behind. Alice, humming under her breath, fell in beside the President with a casual grin.</p><p>“So, Madam President,” Alice chirped after a few minutes, “are you planning to outrun us, or are we allowed to keep up today?” Agatha laughed softly, a low, rich sound that sent a surprising jolt through Rio’s chest. “You can keep up, Agent Wu.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw tightened slightly. She lengthened her stride, focusing on the perimeter, on the rhythm of her steps – anything but the magnetic pull she felt when Agatha matched her pace. As Agatha drifted closer, her voice pitched low for Rio’s ears. “You’re quiet this morning Agent Vidal.”</p><p>“I am focused, ma’am.”</p><p>“Focused on your job or focused on ignoring me?” Rio’s pulse ticked up. “On the job ma’am.” Agatha gave a sly little smile, her blue eyes glittering. “Of course.” Alice a few steps behind now called out cheerfully. “You know, I am still recovering from the last time you sparred with us, ma’am. I think I bruised in places I didn’t know I could.”</p><p>Agatha laughed, shooting Alice a warm glance over her should. “You held your own well enough, Agent Wu. Agent Vidal here is the real challenge.”</p><p>Rio’s cheeks heated despite the cool air. She increased her pace slightly, hoping the conversation would drop – but Agatha matched her effortlessly, her long legs eating up the ground with ease. They ran down toward the edge of the gardens, where the morning light painted the trees in soft amber gold.</p><p>The air smelled faintly of dew and fresh earth. Rio took a steadying breath, trying to center herself. “You know,” Agatha murmured beside her, “you don’t have to be so tense Agent Vidal. We are just running.”</p><p>Rio kept her gaze forward. “With respect ma’am, I’m responsible for your safety. I can’t afford to relax.” Agatha’s lips curved into a knowing smile. “Is that what you tell yourself?”</p><p>Alice jogging a distance behind them, shouted out, “Vidal I think she might be faster than you!” Rio rolled her eyes, “Stay focused Alice” Rio shouted back.  Agatha laughed softly, “Oh, let her talk, Agent Vidal. She’s amusing.”</p><p>They reached the far edge of the grounds, where the Potomac shimmered faintly in the distance. Agatha slowed slightly, turning to face the two agents. “Let’s pause here for a moment,” She said lightly, “Enjoy the view.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then gave a sharp nod scanning the area and signaling for Alice to go check in with the other agents quickly. As she turned and walked down the path, Agatha stepped closer to Rio.</p><p>“You’re always so controlled, Agent. Always so composed. Don’t you ever wonder what it would be like to let go, just a little?” Rio’s throat tightened. “That’s not my role, ma’am.” Agatha tilted her head, eyes gleaming with that look like she was reading Rio with practiced ease. “Pity.”</p><p>Alice rejoined them with a grin. “You know Vidal, if she keeps teasing you like this, you’re going to pop a blood vessel.”</p><p>“Enough Alice.” Rio mutter, though her lips twitched faintly despite herself. Agatha laughed again, the sound soft and pleased. “Shall we head back?”</p><p>They turned slowing their jog to an easy pace toward the residence. The early sunlight painted everything in a golden glow, and for a moment, Rio let herself enjoy the rhythm of the run, and the steady pulse of the earth beneath her feet.</p><p>As they neared the steps, Agatha slowed, glancing sidelong at Rio. “Agent Vidal, I think we should make these runs a regular thing.” Rio swallowed hard. “If that is your preference ma’am.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile deepened, “Oh I have many preferences.”</p><p>Alice caught up, breathless but grinning, “You two are exhausting.” Agatha gave a soft laugh, brushing a stray curl back from her face. “And yet, here you are Agent Wu.” They reached the steps and Agatha turned smoothly, her expression amused and just a touch wicked. “Thank you for the company, Agents.”</p><p>Rio inclined her head, “Anytime, ma’am.” Agatha’s eyes glinted. “Oh, I know.” With that, she disappeared inside, leaving Rio standing tense and still her heart pounding.</p><p>Beside her, Alice let out a low whistle. “Vidal you are so, so screwed.” Rio exhaled slowly, pressing a hand to her forehead. “Don’t start, Alice.”</p><p>“Oh, I am starting,” Alice grinned. “This is the best entertainment I’ve had in months. But seriously Rio, you need to breathe. You look like you just ran a marathon – and we weren’t even sprinting.”</p><p>“I’m fine,” Rio muttered, her voice it’s clipped tone. “Oh yeah you’re <em>fine</em> all right,” Alice said, waggling her eyebrows as they headed back inside the White House, “Totally not rattled. Totally not watching Madam President with the same look I give a double chocolate cake.”</p><p>Rio shot her another glare, “Alice.”</p><p>“Relax, Vidal. It’s just me.” Alice bumped her shoulder lightly. “You don’t have to play Secret Service Agent Ice Queen with me.” She smirked. “And come on, you can’t tell me that you don’t feel <em>something</em> when she pulls that ‘oh, I have many preferences’ lines on you.”</p><p>Rio exhaled slowly, rolling her shoulders back. “She flirts with everyone, Alice. You know that.”</p><p>“No, she doesn’t Rio.” Alice gave her a knowing look. “You’re the only one she does it too and she’s making you nervous. That’s saying something.”</p><p>Before Rio could answer, her earpiece crackled softly. She tapped it, automatically falling back into professional mode. “Vidal here.”</p><p>“Copy,” came Agent Singh’s voice from the other end, stationed over by the North Portico. “Perimeter secure. No unusual activity. We’re rotating out for shift change in ten.”</p><p>“Understood,” Rio replied smoothly. “I’ll brief the new team.” As she straightened, Alice gave her a low whistle. “Back to business huh?”</p><p>“Always,” Rio said, adjusting her jacket.</p><p>--</p><p>Inside the residence, Agatha paused just inside the hallway, a small, satisfied smile playing at the corner of her mouth. She peeled off her gloves slowly, thoughtfully, her mind half on the morning run, half on the look in Agent Vidal’s eyes.</p><p>So serious, so controlled. Agatha chuckled softly. She admired competence – craved it really - but there was something especially satisfying about watching Rio wrestle with that razor’s edge between duty and something more dangerous.</p><p>“Ma’am,” William approached with a clipboard in hand, “your 8:30 briefing has been moved to the Situation Room. There has been an update on the Geneva negotiations.” Agatha added smoothly. “Thank you, William.” She slid her jacket off, handing it over.</p><p>“Also please arrange for Agent Vidal, Wu, and Singh to be at my dress fittings for the White House Correspondents dinner.” Agatha spoke evenly, even though she had an ulterior motive.</p><p>“Will do Ma’am.” William nodded, taking the jacket and putting it away.</p><p>This would be fun.</p><p>--</p><p>The security van pulled discreetly into the alley behind an upscale Georgetown boutique, windows tinted in near black. Rio stepped out first, scanning the area with sharp eyes, one hand resting near her sidearm.</p><p>Agent Wu-Gulliver, stepped out after, gum in her mouth, bouncing on her toes like she was going to a boxing match instead of a dress fitting. Agent Singh adjusted his cuff mic with clinical precision.</p><p>The final person out of the vehicle was the chief of staff Jen, immaculate as always in a navy pantsuit and low heels. She slipped on her sunglasses and gave Rio a curt nod.</p><p>“Let’s make this fast, clean, and quiet.” She said briskly. “I don’t want some tabloid getting a shot of the President before the dinner even happens.” She eyed Alice who was still bouncing. “And no commentary unless it is absolutely necessary.”</p><p>Alice mock zipped her lips. “You wound me, Jen.” Jen rolled her eyes, “Not yet but keep testing me.”</p><p>Inside the boutique, everything was already secure. The building had been swept, the boutique owner and assistant were vetted, and two Secret Service agents were stationed outside. The fitting suit, a luxurious private space with floor-length mirrors and ivory furnishings, had been prepper for one very important customer.</p><p>Rio double-checked the perimeter again anyway.</p><p>“This is excessive,” Singh mutter under his breath. “Agreed,” Jen said as she surveyed the plush room, “but it’s also Georgetown. Last thing we need is a leaked photo of the President half-dressed next to a rack of sequins.”</p><p>Just then, the black SUV pulled up behind the building. Rio’s back straightened as if yanked by wire. Agatha Harkness stepped out with her usual poise, wearing a navy trench coat and sunglasses, her brown curls pinned in an artful twist. Even in the soft afternoon light, she looked like a woman who owned everything within a mile radius.</p><p>“Good afternoon, Agents,” she said smoothly, sliding her sunglasses into one hand. “Jen.”</p><p>“Madam President,” Jen greeted, then gave her a once over. “Ready for the circus?”</p><p>“I’m told it’s a fitting,” Agatha said with a faint smile, “not a gladiator match.”</p><p>“Same thing where you’re involved.” Jen teased following Agatha into the closed off dressing room. Rio followed in behind with Alice, Singh staying outside the door.</p><p>Agatha laughed, her gazing sliding briefly – and intentionally – to Rio. “I do try t keep thinks interesting.” Rio didn’t flinch. “Boutique is secured, ma’am. Suite is clear.”</p><p>Agatha smiled and stepped behind the screen to change, while the rest of them waited – Jen seated with her phone, Singh outside the door, and Alice pretending not to snoop. If she wasn’t subtle with Agatha, then Alice might as well shout her interest in Jen from the rooftops.</p><p>“I thought dress fitting would be boring,” Alice whispered to Rio, “but this is tense. I feel like someone’s about to snap a garter.”</p><p>“Wu,” Rio warned under her breath. “Behind the screen, Agatha laughed – clearly hearing them. “You always keep them on such a tight leash, Agent Vidal.”</p><p>“She tries.” Alice muttered, earning an elbow to the rib from Rio. Jen didn’t look up from her phone. “I live in fear of both of you opening your mouths in public.”</p><p>A moment later, Agatha stepped out – and all conversation stopped. The gown was a deep sapphire blue, sleeveless, silk that shimmered in the light. It hugged Agatha’s figure perfectly, the neckline both dignified and daring. The room seemed to tilt slightly as she moved to stand by the mirror.</p><p>Alice gave a low whistle, Rio couldn’t tear her eyes off Agatha, and Jen glanced up giving a single approving nod. “You’re going to make headlines.” Jen said.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes, however, slid to Rio. “And you? Agent Vidal?” Rio was still as she tore her eyes off Agatha knowing she had been caught. She met her gaze, dark brown somehow impossibly darker, meeting blue eyes that matched her own.</p><p>“You look… very distinguished, ma’am.” Rio spoke, her voice subtly portraying the rapid number of emotions she was feeling.</p><p>Jen raised one eyebrow.</p><p>“<em>Distinguished</em>?” Alice muttered. “Girl, you have lost the thread.” Alice let out with a sigh.</p><p>Agatha just smiled that knowing look, “Is that your professional opinion?”</p><p>Rio decided, for once, just to risk a little bit.</p><p>“My professional opinion is that the neckline poses a slight security concern,” Rio said in that low, even honeyed voice, “It may encourage… distraction.” Jen choked very softly on her coffee. Alice wheezed.</p><p>Agatha, visibly delighted with a flush creeping up her neck, turned back to the mirror. “Noted.” Rio things for once, she is the one that threw Agatha off-guard.</p><p>The tailor, Elise, stepping in to adjust the hem. As her hands slid up the gown’s side, Rio’s eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly. Her jaw tightened, a pulse ticking at her temple.</p><p>“That’s far enough,” Rio said, voice low and edged with steel. Elise froze, glancing up wide eyes. “Oh! Yes, of course, Agent – apologies.”</p><p>Agatha, watching the entire scene unfold in the mirror, let her lips curl into a knowing, slow smile. She tilted her head, meeting Rio’s reflection directly, her voice dropping to a silken purr.</p><p>“You take your job very seriously, Agent Vidal.” Her gaze swept deliberately from Rio’s rigid posture to her clenched jaw. “Tell me… is it just my safety from needled you’re protecting?”</p><p>Rio’s spine snapped even straighter. “My duty is your security, ma’am.”</p><p>Jen, from the corner, let out an audible sigh, pinching the bridge of her nose. “For the love of God, can we keep this a dress fitting and not an exercise in... territorial posturing?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss a beat. Her smile deepened, slow and dangerous, like a cat playing with its prey. “Oh, I can multitask, Jen. I always do.”</p><p>Alice let out a strangled little wheeze, turning quickly to hide her grin. Rio’s fingers twitched at her sides – just once – before she locked them back behind her back, jaw tight, eyes forward. Agatha’s voice came again, soft and amused just for her. “Careful, Agent. Someone might think you mind when they touch me.”</p><p>The air between them crackled, sharp as live wire. Rio exhaled slowly, forcing her voice even. “I mind when anyone poses a potential risk, ma’am.” Agatha’s laugh was low, rich, and thoroughly unconvinced. “Mmmm. Of course you do.”</p><p>--</p><p>After Agatha tried on two more gowns, all equally stunning, she stepped behind the screen to change back into her coat. Jen stood and tucked her phone away. “We’re moving in five. Let’s not loiter.” Rio nodded once; her jaw tight. She could feel the ghost of Agatha’s gaze on her skin.</p><p>A moment later, Agatha stepped out, sliding on her sunglasses. “Let’s head out,” she said, her tone smooth as satin. Then she turned to Rio, voice pitched low only for her to hear, “You’ll be attending the Correspondents’ Dinner, yes?”</p><p>“I’ll be a part of your security team,” Rio replied, keeping her posture rigid. “Good,” Agatha said, her smile slow and deliberate. “I like having you close.”</p><p>Behind them, Jen muttered, “Oh for the love of…” Alice wheezed, “This is not sustainable.”</p><p>As they made their way to the exit, Agatha paused just before stepping into the SUV. She glanced over her shoulder at Rio. “You were right by the way,” she said softly. “The neckline is distraction.”</p><p>Rio’s expression didn’t waiver – but her eyes darkened for Agatha to see. “Next time,” Agatha added, eyes glinting, “you’ll help me pick the dress.”</p><p>She slid into the car. Alice swiveled toward Jen. “So, you going to pretend you don’t see that?” Jen exhaled, pulling out a protein bar, and deadpanned, “I’m pretending it’s someone else’s problem.”</p><p>Rio, still watching the SUV, said nothing – but the faintest tension in her shoulders gave her away. Alice elbowed her, “You are so doomed.”</p><p>And Jen? Jen just shook her head and muttered, “This administration is going to kill me.”</p>

<p>io stood in the narrow hallway outside the Oval Office, her back pressed to the cool wall, her earpiece crackling with static. Agatha had asked for the room, talking to a foreign diplomat. Down the corridor, the muffled sound of voices could be heard – Agatha’s voice, low and coaxing, another woman’s laugh, sharp and dangerous.</p><p>She moved, boots silent on the carpet, hand on her sidearm, heart pounding faster than it ever should. The door was ajar, lightly spilling out, and as she pushed it all the way open…</p><p>There was Agatha.</p><p>Not behind the desk, but still in command – pressing the woman against it, her head thrown back, throat bared, a soft sound slipping from her parted lips. Her dark curls tumbled loose, her blouse half open, skin flushed.</p><p>For a moment, Rio’s brain stalled, caught between alarm and something far more dangerous. Then Agatha’s blue eyes flicker up locking onto hers – sharp, knowing, half-lidded. “Agent Vidal,” she murmured, her hands roving over the woman, voice like silk sliding across skin, “You’re late.”</p><p>Suddenly, a shadowed figure stepped out from behind her. Rio lunged, her hand closed around Agatha’s wrist, yanking her back, pulling her flush against her body. She felt Agatha’s breath hitch, her hands curl into Rio’s jacket, her mouth ghosting over Rio’s ear…</p><p>“Too slow, Agent.” Agatha whispered, “You’re always too slow.”</p><p>A flash of movement – a blade –</p><p>Rio jolted awake, heart slamming against her ribs, breath tearing from her throat. She sat bolt upright in bed, chest heaving, sweat slicking her skin.</p><p>Damn it.</p><p>The dim numbers on her besides the clock blinked 4:17 a.m.</p><p>Rio scrubbed a hand over her face, exhaling hard. Another dream. Another damn dream.</p><p>She swung her legs over the side of the bed, planting her feet on the cool floor. The faint buzz of her work phone on the nightstand broke the silence. She grabbed it, thumbed through a few updates – briefings, motorcade timing, security clearance lists.</p><p>Her reflection in the dark window stared back at her – dark eyes, sharp jawline, muscle coiled tight under tanned skin. Controlled, measured, always.</p><p>She needed to be sharp tonight. No room for this kind of noise.</p><p>Tonight was the White House Correspondents’ Dinner. The biggest, glitziest, most maddening public event of the year. Cameras, reporters, politicians, celebrities – and Agatha Harkness at the center of it all.</p><p>Rio exhaled, shaking out her shoulders.</p><p>Focus.</p><p>--</p><p>The White House was a hive of motion by late afternoon.</p><p>Down in the secure prep room, Rio adjusted the collar of her sharp black tuxedo jacket, glancing at herself briefly in the mirror. The tailored cut hugged her lean frame, crisp and profession, but the knot in her stomach wouldn’t loosen.</p><p>“Damn Vidal,” Alice drawled from across the room, where she was tying her own black tie with a cocky grin. “You clean up nice. Should we be worried you’ll outshine the President tonight?”</p><p>Rio shot her a dry look but gave no response.</p><p>Alice smirked turning back to the mirror she was in front of, “You going to tell me why you’ve been grinding your teeth all day? You’re wound tighter than a drum all day.”</p><p>“Security detail is tight tonight. Women can’t be in accepted into positions of power without being perfect.” Rio said curtly, turning to check the seating map again. “High-profile attendees, international press, at least three Senators who hate her guts, and two people rumored to be ex-lovers. Nothing about this is routine.”</p><p>Alice gave her a lazy grin, “Right, right, it’s all about the job.”</p><p>Before Rio could snap back, Jen breezed in, tablet in hand, sleek navy suit impeccable as always. “Alright, kids,” she said briskly, glancing between them and the other agents, “Motorcade leaves in twenty. Madam President wants eyes on the floor before she arrives, double sweeps on the guest list, and no – I repeat – no theatrics in front of the press.”</p><p>Her sharp eyes cut to Alice.</p><p>“What?” Alice said innocently. “I am a model of restraint.”</p><p>Jen rolled her eyes, “Try harder.” She pivoted to Rio. “You’ve got primary watch on the President. Stick close, but don’t hover. And for God’s sake, try not to look like you want to murder everyone who talks to her, okay?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw ticked. “Understood.”</p><p>Jen arched an eyebrow, then muttered under her breath as she stalked out, “I need a raise.”</p><p>--</p><p>By the time they reached the ballroom, the place was glittering sea of gowns, tuxedos, jewels, and camera flashes.</p><p>Rio moved through the crowd like a shadow, sharp-eyed, taking in every exit, every cluster of reporters, every unfamiliar face.</p><p>And then –</p><p>Rio saw her.</p><p>President Agatha Harkness stepped through the grand entrance, a vision in deep emerald silk, the fabric hugging her curves, her dark curls pinned back to reveal the elegant line of her throat. Her lips were painted a deep wine-red, her blue eyes alight with power and amusement.</p><p>Every head turned.</p><p>Rio felt her breath catch for just half a second – then snapped herself back to alert.</p><p>Alice appeared at her elbow, whispering, “Pick up your jaw, Vidal.”</p><p>“Eyes on the room.” Rio growled, even as Agatha’s gaze swept across the crowd – and landed directly other.</p><p>The faint, knowing smile curved Agatha’s lips.</p><p>She moved like she owned the floor, accepting greetings, shaking hands, flashing that magnetic charm that made people lean in closer, laugh too loudly, stumble over their own words.</p><p>Jen kept pace beside her, expression sharp as ever, murmuring reminders and updates. William Kaplan hovered nearby, checking his tablet, a small frown creasing his young face.</p><p>Rio moved into position, staying close, always just behind, watching everything. Watching <em>everyone.</em></p><p>--</p><p>Agatha stood at the podium after socializing for a couple hours, a soft hush falling over the glittering ballroom. The lights caught the faint streaks of silver in her dark curls, the sharp elegance of her emerald gown, the quiet steel in her expression.</p><p>She let the applause settle, resting her hands lightly on either side of the podium. Then she leaned in, her voice calm, even – but resonant.</p><p>“Good evening.</p><p>When I was growing up in Salem, Massachusetts, there were two things I knew for absolute certainty.</p><p>First: I wanted to fight. Not with fists – though believe me, I was tempted more than once – but with my mind. With sharp words, with better arguments, with iron determination.</p><p>And second: that there were people who didn’t believe a girl like me belonged anywhere near power.</p><p>You see, I didn’t grow up in an easy household. My mother, Evanora Harkness, was a woman of exacting standards. To put it bluntly – she was abusive, in every wat that matters. She tried to make me small. She tried to crush me, remake me into some quiet, obedient, fragile.</p><p>But the thing is…</p><p>I was never fragile.</p><p>I survived her. I outlasted her. And I carried that fight forward.</p><p>I worked my way through Harvard Law, graduating top of my class, not because the world expected it – but because I demanded it. I became a prosecuting attorney, fighting for the voiceless. I climbed the ladder to Attorney General, then to Senator. Fighting for the people. For you.</p><p>And now I stand here before you as the first female President of the United States of America.”</p><p>She let the words hand there, her gaze sweeping the room, calm and fierce. Rio felt tears forming at the raw emotion and confidence radiating off her.</p><p>“I stand here tonight as a 55-year-old queer woman. The first of her kind to hold this office – and I stand here not just for myself, but for every woman in America who has been told she is ‘too much’. Too ambitious. Too loud. Too passionate. Too angry. Too queer. Too different.</p><p>I stand here to say:</p><p>You are never too much.</p><p>You are exactly enough.</p><p>And you are powerful beyond measure.”</p><p>The room was utterly still, breathless.</p><p>Agatha’s voice softened, just a touch, a faint tremble threading through her words.</p><p>“For the young girl sitting at home right now, watching this on TV, wondering if her dreams are too big. For the survivor wondering if her pain disqualifies her from greatness. For the woman in the boardroom, the classroom, the courtroom, the hospital, the battlefield – wondering if she is allowed to want more.</p><p>You are.</p><p>You are allowed to want <em>everything</em>.</p><p>And here’s the Truth, they don’t tell you:</p><p>You can win. You can stand at the top.</p><p>I am living proof.</p><p>Here’s to the hard road.</p><p>Here’s to the long fight.</p><p>And here’s to every woman who dares to stand at the summit – and <em>own it</em>.</p><p>Thank you.”</p><p>Cheers rippled through the crowd as they clapped, giving a standing ovation as Agatha stepped back from the podium, a small knowing smile gracing her face. For just a moment, her sharp blue eyes flicked across the crowd – and landed, briefly, on one figure standing silent at the edge of the room.</p><p>Rio Vidal.</p><p>Standing there like a shadow, like a storm barely held in check, like the one thing Agatha could never quite outmaneuver.</p><p>And Agatha thought with a faint, private thrill:</p><p>She had won.</p><p>--</p><p>The applause was deafening.</p><p>Rio stood at the edge of the ballroom, a quiet shadow against the glittering wall of bodies and wine glasses and pressed tuxedos. The light from the chandeliers shimmered off sequined gowns, crystal, silverware. A thousand people clapped like they had just witnessed a miracle.</p><p>And maybe they had.</p><p>Because Agatha Harkness had just lit the room on fire – not with volume, not with spectacle, but with the kind of honesty that left scorch marks.</p><p>Rio had heard the speech from her post – every word, every pause. She’d watched Agatha’s shoulders hold the weight of it, had seen the flicker in her eyes, when she spoke about her mother. About survival. About fighting her way to the top, scarred and still standing.</p><p>Rio had fought things. People. Entire nations. But nothing scared her more than how much she wanted to protect that woman. And how easily that woman could bring her to her knees.</p><p>The applause began to fade, but the shift was instant. Agatha stepped off the stage, and the sea surged toward her.</p><p>Senators, actors, journalists, tech CEOs – they all pressed in, drawn to her like moths to a flame.</p><p>She moved throw them with ease, smiling, dipping her head, accepting handshakes and compliments and empty words layered in politics.</p><p>And Rio watched.</p><p>She watched everything. Every hand that lingered too long on Agatha’s bare arm. Every chuckle that edged too close to flirtation. Every brush of touch that wasn’t protocol.</p><p>Senator Blake leaned in with that cocky tilt of his head – the same one who once said that women made ‘emotional leaders’. Agatha laughed at something he said, and Rio’s fingers twitched.</p><p>Lilia Merrin, that young actress from the Hulu political drama, clutched Agatha’s wrist like they were old friends. Whispered something in her ear. Agatha tilted her head back and smiled – Polite. Cool. Unreadable.</p><p>It shouldn’t bother her. It shouldn’t.</p><p>But Rio could feel the jealousy flare in her throat like a swallowed flame.</p><p>“You’re brooding,” came Alice’s voice through her comm.</p><p>“I’m working.” Rio replied evenly.</p><p>“You’re brooding while working.” A pause. “Also glaring. I’m across the ballroom and I can see the scowl from here.”</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw. “Eyes on your sector, Wu.” Alice snorted. “Sure, sure. Just trying to figure out how we’re going to scrape you off the marble when you combust.”</p><p>Rio said nothing. Her eyes locked on Agatha, who was now speaking with Leonard Vale – media mogul, power broker, human oil slick.</p><p>He took her hand, kissed it, and something low in that slick practiced voice. Agatha smiled. Rio didn’t move, but every inch of her body went taut.</p><p>Vale’s eyes flicked – following Agatha’s brief glance – and landed directly on Rio. They held for a half beat too long. He smiled. Smug. Knowing.</p><p>Agatha said something Rio couldn’t hear. Vale touched her sleeve lightly. Rio shifted her stance purely out of protocol – if he touched her again…</p><p>Then suddenly, Agatha turned. She slid out of the knot of people with the smooth elegance of someone that had done it a thousand times. And she walked straight towards Rio.</p><p>Her heels clicked softly over the marble. Her emerald gown shimmered like a forest fire under the lights. Rio’s eyes couldn’t stop the way the trailed over her before holding Agatha’s gaze. She stopped just close enough that Rio could smell her perfume – something subtle, smoky, expensive.</p><p>“Agent Vidal,” Agatha murmured, voice pitched low. “Tell me honestly – how am I doing tonight?”</p><p>Rio swallowed. Hard.</p><p>“You’re breathtaking, ma’am.” Rio said, the words clipped but true. “As always.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, eyes glittering. “And you’re wound tighter than I have ever seen you. I can feel it from across the room.”</p><p>“I am fine.”</p><p>“Mmmm.” Agatha looked at her with that knowing look. The one that drove her crazy. The silence between them stretched. Tense. Private. Loaded. Her gaze dropped to Rio’s mouth. Just for a breath. A flicker.</p><p>Then Jen appeared like a storm cloud on heels, flanked by staff. “Ma’am, CNN is ready when you are, and the BBC rep is hovering near the bar like a hawk.” Agatha sighed faintly, turning her head but not stepping away. “Of course.”</p><p>“After you Madam President.” Rio extended a handout gesturing that she would follow her. As the President turned, Rio’s arm dropped her side, where her fingers twitched. Her heart thudded painfully in her chest.</p><p>--</p><p>Later, after the speeches – after the pointed jabs from comedians, after the polite applause, after the delicate political balancing acts – Rio followed Agatha backstage as she wrapped up a quiet conversation with a major network anchor.</p><p>“Agent Vidal,” Agatha murmured falling into step beside her, “you’re brooding tonight.”</p><p>“I am doing my job ma’am.”</p><p>“Mmmm,” Agatha mused, reaching a handout to stop Rio with a hand on her arm. It lit every nerve ending on fire through her jacket. “That is what you always say.”</p><p>“You’re attracting a lot of attention,” Rio said quietly, eyes flickering over the small knot of press waiting by the side entrance. “We need to keep moving and get you back on the floor.”</p><p>Agatha’s smile deepened, “Jealousy doesn’t suit you, Agent Vidal.”</p><p>Rio froze for half a second, her throat tightening. “I’m not …”</p><p>“Relax,” Agatha almost purred, looking up at Rio with those icy eyes impossibly dark, “You’re doing wonderfully.”</p><p>Before Rio could reply, Jen swept over briskly, pulling Agatha out and toward the waiting photo line. “Ma’am, if we could just…”</p><p>“I will be right there Jen,” Agatha said smoothly, flicking a glance back at Rio. “Stay close, Agent.”</p><p>Rio watched her glide away, feeling her pulse thrum harder under her skin.</p><p>--</p><p>The motorcade slid through the dark streets of D.C., headlights cutting sharp beams across the wet pavement. Inside the black SUV, Agatha leaned back against the leather seat, one hand resting casually on her lap, the other toying with the clasp on her evening clutch.</p><p>Across from her, Rio sat stiff-backed, every nerve humming under her skin. She kept her eyes trained out the tinted window, earpiece crackling softly as agents checked in one by one.</p><p>“Agent Vidal,” Agatha murmured, her voice smooth as silk, “you’re unusually quiet.”</p><p>Rio didn’t turn. “Standard post-event protocol, ma’am.”</p><p>“Mmmm,” Agatha hummed, a faint smile curving her lips. “I’m sure.” Beside her, Jen tapped quickly at her phone, half-listening.</p><p>Without warning, Rio’s earpiece crackled sharply.</p><p>“Bravo One, this is Lead Two – possible tail on McPherson, black sedan, no plates, moving erratically.”</p><p>Rio stiffened her hand shot up to her comm, “Lead Two, copy. Confirm route diversion to secure corridor, now.” The SUV jolted slightly as the lead car swerved, the convoy peeling off onto a side street.</p><p>Agatha sat up, her brow arching, “Problem, Agent Vidal?”</p><p>“Stay down ma’am,” Rio said sharply, one hand on her sidearm, and one hand ghosting over Agatha’s knee. Jen paled slightly, glancing out the window, “What the hell…?”</p><p>The black sedan came roaring around the corner, headlights flaring.</p><p>“Bravo One, evasive maneuvers!” Rio barked into her mic. The SUV lurched violented, jerking to the right as the driver swerved. Agatha braced herself against the seat, eyes flashing.</p><p>Outside, the sedan clips the rear-most vehicle sending sparks flying.</p><p>Rio didn’t think – she lunged, shoving Agatha down across the seat, shielding her body with her own. “Stay down!” She hissed.</p><p>Gunshots cracked through the night.</p><p>The convoy surged forward, tires screaming, engines roaring as they raced through the narrow backstreets.</p><p>“Lead One, threat neutralized, no pursuit,” came the sharp voice over comms a tense minute later. “Repeat, no pursuit.”</p><p>Rio stayed braced over Agatha a moment longer, her breath harsh in her chest, every muscle locked tight.</p><p>Slowly, cautiously, she eased back, heart still hammering.</p><p>Agatha looked up at her – hair mussed, her lips slightly parted, a faint flush on her cheeks. For a long moment, neither of them spoke.</p><p>Then Agatha’s lips curved faintly. “Well,” she spoke with that charming tone, “that was exciting.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched. She was going to kill her.</p><p>--</p><p>The motorcade slid through the private White House gates, engines humming low, tires hissing softly on wet pavement.</p><p>Inside the SUV, Agatha sat composed, legs crossed neatly, one hand idly adjusting the clasp of her clutch. Her reflection shimmered faintly in the dark window.</p><p>Rio sat across from her, jaw clenched, eyes hard, earpiece pressed tight.</p><p>The security scare had been fast. Too fast. No one predicted it – no flagged vehicles, no chatter, no advance warning. It was a pure, blind-side hit.</p><p>They’d barely escaped.</p><p>As soon as they convoy rolled to a stop, Rio was out of the vehicle, barking ordered into her mic. Agents swarmed the courtyard, sweeping the area, hustling Agatha inside under tight formation.</p><p>Rio followed close, every nerve burning, heart hammering harder than it should.</p><p>Inside the private study, the moment the door shut behind them, Agatha let out a slow breath, smoothing her palms down the front of her gown.</p><p>“Well,” she said softly, “that was unexpected.”</p><p>Her tone was light – too light, too calm, too breezy for what had just happened.</p><p>Rio’s pulse spiked.</p><p>“Unexpected?” She bit out, stepping forward. “You were nearly hit by a vehicle <em>chasing the presidential motorcade</em>, ma’am. That’s not ‘unexpected’. That’s a breach. That’s a threat.”</p><p>Agatha’s brow arched, “And it was handled.”</p><p>“Handled?” Rio’s voice sharpened as she strode across the room stopping just in front of the President. “We didn’t see it coming. We had <em>no</em> warning, no chatter, no indicators on the ground. That’s catastrophic failure in security, ma’am – and you’re just…”</p><p>Her voice broke off, sharp with the force of emotion behind it. She dragged a hand through her short dark hair, trying to steady her breathing as she exhaled and turned away from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha’s sharp blue eyes softened faintly as she watched her. “Agent.”</p><p>But Rio shook her head, pacing a step away, fists clenched. “You don’t get it. You can’t get it. I watched that car close on us, and all I could think – the only thing going through my head – was what I would do if they took you out right there. If I failed. I couldn’t…”</p><p>She cut herself off, jaw tight.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was quieter now, low and measured as she heard heels click across the ground. “You didn’t fail.”</p><p>Rio turned sharply. “You’re not the one who must live with that risk ma’am. I am.” Rio looked down meeting those captivating blue eyes and realized for the first time how close they were standing.</p><p>A tense beat stretched between them.</p><p>Agatha stepped forward, slow and deliberate, until she was barely a breath away. “You care,” she murmured, her voice edged with something raw, “more than you’re supposed to.”</p><p>Rio’s throat tightened. “I have to care ma’am. That’s the job.”</p><p>Agatha gave a soft, almost broken laugh, her fingers reaching out as they ghosted themselves over the lapels of Rio’s jacket. “No Agent Vidal,” she whispered. “That’s not why.”</p><p>The air between them pulsed, hot and sharp, too full of everything they weren’t saying.</p><p>For a heartbeat, neither of them moved.</p><p>Rio felt her chest rising and falling, too fast, too hard, her eyes locked on Agatha’s – and for one wild second, they both looked like they might shatter.</p><p>She stepped forward, closing the last breath of space between them.</p><p>Agatha’s breath caught softly, her lashes fluttering as Rio lifted a calm and sure hand – fingers brushing along the sharp line of her jaw, tucking a loose curl behind her ear.</p><p>“Say my name,” Rio murmured, voice low, rough, almost breaking.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted, her eyes darkening to a storm. “Rio,” she whispered – barely a sound, just the shape of the word, as if it were something sacred.</p><p>Rio leaned in, her mouth brushing feather-light over Agatha’s – not quite a kiss, just the faintest, trembling ghost of contact. Enough to feel the heat, the pull, the impossible ache between them.</p><p>Agatha’s hand lifted, curling lightly in Rio’s jacket her breath hitching –</p><p>“I love the way it sounds on her lips,” Rio whispered, almost a breath her eyes flickering over Agatha’s searching –</p><p>A sharp knock at the door sounded.</p><p>They jerked apart like they had been set on fire, Rio turning away as she immediately raked a hand through her hair.</p><p>“Madam President,” Jen’s voice called, brisk but slightly strained. They’re requesting you in the Situation Room. Debrief in five.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes squeezed shut for half a heartbeat, before turning and moving towards the door. “Duty calls.” She murmured loud enough for Rio to hear.</p><p>She turned meeting Agatha’s gaze, steeling her expression again. “Yes, ma’am.”</p><p>At the door, Agatha paused – turning just enough to glance back, her yes still a little too bright, her voice softer, raw.</p><p>“Thank you, Rio.”</p><p>And then she was gone.</p><p>Rio stood alone in the room, chest heaving, her lips tingling, her hands clenched tight behind her back to keep from shaking. And Rio knew, she would lay down her life to hear her name come out of Agatha's mouth like that again.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The echo of her name was still burning in Rio’s ears.</p><p><em>Rio</em>.</p><p>Agatha had whispered it like a secret – like a truth she hadn’t meant to say out loud. Not Agent Vidal. Just Rio.</p><p>She walked through the corridor to the Situation Room in silence, trailing Agatha, her boots barely whispering against the polished floors. The white halls, so pristine and historic during the day, had turned stark and sterile under the hum of recessed lighting. Only the faint buss of security comms and the occasional scuff of another agent’s step reminded her this place never truly slept.</p><p>Her mind, though, wouldn’t stop spinning as they strode through the hallway. Not with the way Agatha had said it. Not with the impossible heat of their almost-kiss. Rio wondered briefly what Agatha would have sounded like moaning it.</p><p>Would she say it like she owned it? Like it was the only name she was supposed to say for the rest of her life?</p><p>Rio’s chest still felt tight. Her pulse hadn’t settled. And now she had to walk into a national security debrief like none of it happened. Because none of it could happen. She reached the reinforced doors. Two guards nodded her through without a word.</p><p>Inside, the air was sharp with tension.</p><p>A large display glowed across one wall, showing satellite footage, traffic overlays, and tactical maps. Around the sleek conference table, the President’s top brass was already gathering.</p><p>Yelena Belove, Secretary of Defense, lounged back in her seat like she owned the place – all black leather, platinum-blonde braid, and eyes that had seen a thousand battlefields. Her boots were kicked up on the base of the table, her arms crossed, unimpressed.</p><p>Across from her sat Lilia Calderu, Secretary of State, spine straight and posture regal, her silver-streaked hair drawn into a flawless knot. Her gaze was already locked on the screen, calculating.</p><p>And at the far end stood the five-star general Steve Rogers, one of the men Rio had served under. His uniform was crisp and the face that had once graced propaganda posters hadn’t aged at all.</p><p>“General,” Rio said, taking her seat. Her posture was crisp, but the weight of Agatha’s scent still clung to her jacket like a phantom.</p><p>The room fell into a hush as the final figure entered – not Agatha, but Jen. The Chief of Staff entered, tablet in hand, lips drawn in a firm line.</p><p>“The President is taking a final briefing from William and will join us shortly,” Jen announced. “We will begin with what we know.”</p><p>The screens shifted. Surveillance footage played silently – grainy traffic cams, heat signatures. The black sedan that had attacked the motorcade was traced frame by frame. They watched it tail the convoy, then make its erratic charge. They watched it crash, smoke, burn. The driver had been unrecognizable. No survivors. Rio’s jaw clenched.</p><p>Monica Rambeau, Director of National Intelligence, stood after the clips ended, “Interpol confirmed twenty minutes ago,” Monica said grimly, “The VIN was traced to a ghost registry tied to Sokovian paramilitary activity. Burn phones recovered from the wreck match similar intel flagged last quarter – but this is the first direct attempt on a U.S. President we’ve seen from the quadrant in over a decade.”</p><p>Lilia’s voice was low, calm. “They’re escalating.”</p><p>“They’re desperate,” Yelena said flatly, “Sokovia’s collapse fractured their intelligence networks, but whoever’s left knows how to stir chaos. This wasn’t meant to kill. It was meant to send a message.”</p><p>“Consider it delivered,” Steve said, voice like a cold knife. “So, the question is, what’s the message?”</p><p>“Eastern Europe.” Lilia said, already flipping through a set of digital documents. “We’ve seen rising instability across the Baltics. There’s been a shift in cyber behavior – proxy strikes, sabotage, low-level data leaks. This hit might not be about the President personally. It might be about what she represents to Europe.”</p><p>“Strength,” Yelena muttered. “Stability. Female power.” Her gaze flicked to Rio. “And threat.”</p><p>“More than that,” Lilia said. “We’ve been in active talks with Romania, Lithuania, and Latvia on a joint defense accord. Sokovia’s old power base sees that as betrayal. They’re trying to destabilize perception.</p><p>Rio’s brow furrowed as she growled out, “They came after her <em>on American soil.</em>”</p><p>“Exactly.” Lilia said, eyes sharp. “That is not just a threat. That’s a challenge.”</p><p>Before anyone could answer, the door opened again.</p><p>Agatha entered and everyone stood.</p><p>She was no longer in her emerald gown. Now she wore a sharp navy skirt, white blouse, and her makeup removed, her curls gathered into a sleek twist. But even stripped down to power mode, she looked regal. Controlled. Dangerous.</p><p>And when her eyes met Rio’s – for just a fraction of a second – the heat of the study came roaring back.</p><p>Rio’s breath caught, but she said nothing.</p><p>“Madam President,” Steve said with a nod, everyone taking their seats as Agatha sat at the head of the table.</p><p>“Let’s get to work.” Agatha said smoothly.</p><p>--</p><p>The digital map shifted again, now displaying Eastern Europe under layers of satellite overlays – troop movements, contested borders, line of encrypted chatter. Sokovian pulsed at the center, a web of red dots spreading like veins outward.</p><p>Agatha’s gaze skimmed the room. She didn’t speak for a moment – not because she didn’t know what to say, but because silence was a weapon she wielded well. Let them squirm. Let them lean forward. Let them reveal themselves.</p><p>She folded her hands neatly, then looked to Lilia.</p><p>“Talk to me about Moscow.”</p><p>Lilia straightened; her deep brown eyes unreadable. “The Kremlin claims no knowledge. Of course they would. But their security council has been eerily quiet the last twenty-four hours. I suspect Sokovia has their blessing – or their amusement.”</p><p>Yelena scoff, “Moscow doesn’t blink unless it benefits them. If they’re quiet, they’re watching.”</p><p>“And waiting,” Steve added. “Testing your resolve ma’am.” Agatha nodded once, sharp. “What are our options?”</p><p>Yelena sat up straighter, something electric snapping into her posture. “Retaliation. Soft strike – cyber first. Hit their surveillance infrastructure. Take out two of the ghost networks that keep them fed. We cripple their digital backbone without firing a bullet.”</p><p>“And after that?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Yelena smirked faintly. “Then we do fire bullets.”</p><p>Steve cleared his throat, expression stony. “With respect, Madam President, we’d be looking at NATO backlash. Several of those borders are frozen in diplomatic gray zones. If we move too fast, we fracture the alliances you ran on building and repairing.”</p><p>“Better fractured than blind.” Yelena said cooly. “This as a direct attack on our soil.”</p><p>“And if we overplay it?” Lilia interjected. “We look paranoid. Reactionary. Weak enough to flinch. They want chaos – you give it to them on a silver platter if you turn this into bloodshed.”</p><p>Agatha held up a single finger. The room went silent.</p><p>“I want a full escalation analysis,” she says calmly. “If we push on Sokovia’s networks, who answers? Who benefits? And who dies?”</p><p>Rio watched her. Not the room. Not the screen just her.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was level, almost cool – but Rio could see it. The ire under the surface. The storm behind her blue eyes. She knew what this meant. Not just for the nation, but for herself.</p><p>It had been her life in the crosshairs. Not a convoy, not a symbol. Her.</p><p>And yet she sat there, straight-backed and unflinching, balancing diplomacy and war on the edge of a knife.</p><p>“Madam President.” Lilia said softly, “the world is going to look to you tomorrow morning. Not for rage. Not even for revenge. But for control.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly.</p><p>And then her gaze shifted – not to Steve. Not to her cabinet. But to Rio.</p><p>“Control,” she repeated, eyes locked with hers. “It costs more than people realize.”</p><p>Rio felt the words land like a punch. Because they weren’t just about Sokovia. They weren’t just about policy or power.</p><p>They were about <em>them</em>.</p><p>Agatha blinked, the moment gone, her gaze sweeping forward again.</p><p>“Yelena,” She said.” Run me two options. One: full-spectrum cyber retaliation. Two: precision psychological warfare. I want misinformation leaks that turn their own allies against them. And I want it fast.”</p><p>Yelena grinned like she had just been handed a loaded weapon. “Copy that.”</p><p>“Steve,” Agatha continued. “Draft a response letter to NATIO – calm but firm. Frame it as us respecting procedure, not showing hesitation.”</p><p>“Already on it,” he said, typing quickly on his secure tablet.</p><p>Agatha turned to Lilia. “Get me with the Lithuanian Prime Minister at 0700. And prep a private channel with Romania’s defense minister. If it goes loud, we’ll need to know which neighbors are flinching first.”</p><p>Lilia’s jaw set. “Understood.”</p><p>“Jen, I want press photos of me running tomorrow morning. No signs of weakness. The perfect picture of health like nothing happened.” Agatha stated. “Yes, ma’am I will get that set up.”</p><p>Agatha stood; the room followed suit. A ripple of movement, precise and professional. But no one missed the weight in the air. No one missed the unspoken message:</p><p>This wasn’t over.</p><p>As she collected her files and moved towards the exit, Agatha paused – just slightly – near Rio. No one else noticed. But Rio did. Rio always did.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was low, barely a breath. “Walk with me.”</p><p>Rio fell into step behind her.</p><p>Behind them the room burst into quiet chaos – orders flying, reports being pulled, maps rearranged.</p><p>But for a moment, it was just the two of them walking through the marble halls of power, their shoulders almost brushing, their breathing quiet and in sync.</p><p>At the end of the hall, she slowed, stopping near on the tall windows overlooking the South Lawn. Moonlight bathed the marble floor. Her reflection shimmered faintly in the glass.</p><p>“I need your opinion,” she said quietly.</p><p>Rio blinked. “Ma’am?”</p><p>“Not as my agent,” Agatha said turning slightly to face her. “Not as protocol. I want to know what you think. About Sokovia. About tonight.”</p><p>Rio hesitated. “Why me?”</p><p>Agatha’s smile was faint, but not unkind. “Because you’re the only one in that room who doesn’t benefit from telling me what I want to hear.” She paused before continuing, “And I trust you Rio.” Her voice was low, murmuring Rio’s name.</p><p>Rio’s throat tightened; her eyes fluttering shut before meeting Agatha’s gaze again met with one full of mischief. She wasn’t used to this – to being asked. To being seen.</p><p>She let out a slow breath. “I think tonight was a warning shot. I think Sokovia’s desperate. And I think… if you retaliate too loudly, they’ll come back louder. But if you’re too soft – they will take advantage.”</p><p>Agatha was quiet for a moment, considering.</p><p>“And what would you do,” She murmured, “if you were in my place?”</p><p>Rio met her gaze steady and unflinching. “I’d make sure the next time they moved, they regretted ever setting foot on the board.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved slightly. Not a smile. Not quite. But something sharp. Something like satisfaction.</p><p>“Good,” she said softly. “Because I intend to win.”</p><p>Rio would fall to her knees and crawl for more praise from Agatha.</p><p>She looked at Rio for a moment. “You always tell me the truth.”</p><p>Rio’s voice was quiet. “I always will.”</p><p>Agatha turned her head slightly. “What do you want me to do?”</p><p>Rio stilled.</p><p>This wasn’t about policy. This wasn’t about Sokovia. It was a question from <em>Agatha</em>, not the President. It was dangerous – raw.</p><p>Rio’s voice came out slow. Careful. “I want you safe.”</p><p>Agatha huffed a soft laugh – not cruel, but brittle around the edges. “That’s not part of the job description.”</p><p>“I know.” A pause. “Doesn’t stop me from wanting it.”</p><p>Agatha finally tuned to fully face her. Her makeup was long gone, but something remained – that quiet, cutting beauty that didn’t need polish. The curve of her mouth softened. Her shoulder’s dropped, just a fraction.</p><p>She looked tired, but not weak.</p><p>“Do you ever think,” she murmured, “About what it costs? Being first?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer, her voice barely above a whisper now. “I am not just a woman in this office. I am a symbol. A spectacle. Every move I make is under glass. And God forbid I bleed – because then I am a liability.” She laughed softly, bitterly. “Or worse. A disappointment.”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened. “You’re not a disappointment.”</p><p>Agatha looked up at her. “Aren’t I?” This was about more than the presidency.</p><p>“No.” It came out sharper than intended – more force than she’d meant, but Rio didn’t pull it back. “You are the strongest person I’ve ever known. And I’ve served under people who moved empires. But you…” Her voice dropped, that low honeyed tone curling around her words, “You fight battles no one else sees.”</p><p>A silence stretched between them – charged, intimate.</p><p>Agatha’s voice was rough now. “Then why does it still feel like I’m losing?”</p><p>Rio took a small step closer, their bodies barely brushing. “Because they keep putting you on battlefields.”</p><p>“And you keep pulling me out of them,” Agatha said, voice soft. “Even when I don’t ask.”</p><p>“I always will.” Rio’s voice cracked, just slightly. “Even when you don’t want me too.”</p><p>They were too close now. Not touching. But the gravity of it was unbearable. Rio could smell her – something warm, clean, faintly floral under the night.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes searched hers. “Why?”</p><p>Rio hesitated. Then: “Because I can’t not.”</p><p>There. Spoke. Unsaid. Everything in between.</p><p>Agatha reached up slowly, her fingertips brushing the lapel of Rio’s jacket before gripping it in her hand, pulling her closer. “I have been alone a long time Rio,” she said barely audible. “And you… you make me forget how it felt to survive without anyone.”</p><p>Rio’s breath caught.</p><p>They stood suspended their – between duty and desire, between power and vulnerability, between the White House and whatever this was threatening to become.</p><p>Rio’s voice was hoarse. “Say my name again.” She commanded, her hands resting on Agatha’s hips, pulling her hips flush against her.</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved into a devious smile, as she pulled Rio closer, leaning up to let say her name breathlessly, “Rio.”</p><p>“Agatha,” Rio growled one hand leaving Agatha’s hip to cut the back of Agatha’s neck – firm, possessive, trembling with restraint she’d finally decided to stop pretending she had. Agatha let out a soft gasp, the sound slipping between her parted lips as Rio closed the distance.</p><p>And then she kissed her.</p><p>Not soft.</p><p>Not cautious.</p><p>Rio <em>claimed </em>her.</p><p>She pushed Agatha back, gently but unrelenting, until her spine pressed against the cold marble wall of the alcove. Agatha went willingly – breathless, clutching at the lapels of Rio’s jacket, her fingers fisting into the fabric like she needed something to anchor her.</p><p>Their mouths met in a rush – urgent, unpracticed, hungry. Years of practiced control unraveling in seconds.</p><p>Agatha kissed her back with fire – pulling her in tighter, her body arching into Rio’s as if they were molded for each other.</p><p>Rio’s hand slid to her waist, fingers splaying over silk and heat. She pressed in – claiming and sure. The kind of kiss that said <em>you’re mine and I am tired of pretending otherwise.</em></p><p>Agatha moaned softly into her mouth as she bit at Rio’s lip, sucking it hard before releasing it with a pop. Rio’s lips dragged down along the line of her aw, her breath ragged, “Say it again,” She whispered into the flushed skin of Agatha’s neck.</p><p>Agatha’s head tipped back, breath catching, “Rio…” She whined. Like it was a confession. Like the truth she never dared speak until today.</p><p>Rio growled something unintelligible, her lips crashing back into hers, hungry and reckless. The world narrowed to the heat of Agatha’s mouth, the way her body was grinding into Rio’s, the soft desperate sounds only Rio got to hear.</p><p>Agatha’s hands slid into Rio’s hair, grabbing a fist full and yanking backwards, exposing Rio’s throat for Agatha’s claiming. “Fuck Agatha.” Rio growled out slipping a thigh in between Agatha’s legs. The older woman whined into Rio’s neck her hips chasing the friction.</p><p>Suddenly footsteps.</p><p>Sharp. Coming fast around the corner.</p><p>Voices followed, distant but rising, “… President Harkness said she stepped out this way…”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flew open.</p><p>Rio jerked back like she’d been shocked, her hands dropping instantly, jaw clenching as instinct overtook desire. In one practiced motion, she spun to face the hall, body angling slightly in front of Agatha’s like a shield.</p><p>Agatha was still flushed, lips swollen, her pupils blown wide – but her spine straightened in an instant. She smoothed her suit with trembling hands, already rebuilding the mask. The President again.</p><p>The footsteps grew louder. Closer.</p><p>Rio leaned in fast, her voice a rasp in Agatha’s ear, “Lipstick.”</p><p>Agatha wiped the corner of her mouth with shaking fingers, her breath still uneven.</p><p>“Agent.”</p><p>“Don’t.” Rio hissed. “Not yet.”</p><p>Just before the aide rounded the corner, Agatha stepped cleanly away from the alcove – head held high, expression composed, the only sign of their stolen moment the flush she couldn’t quiet hide.</p><p>The aide appeared, blinking. “Ma’am – sorry to interrupt, we’ve got an urgent sitrep from Lviv. They’re waiting in Command Control.”</p><p>Agatha nodded, voice calm. “Understood. I’ll be there in two.”</p><p>The aide turned and hurried off. Silence returned.</p><p>Rio hadn’t moved, but her fists were still clenched, her breath still heavy in her chest. Agatha turned back to her slowly, eyes flickering over her face like she was memorizing it.</p><p>“Next time,” she whispered, her voice still trembling with desire, “I want to finish this. In a bed.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curled in a dark smile, her eyes raking over Agatha to let her know how much she wanted her. “So do I.”</p><p>And then Agatha stepped into the light and walked away – shoulders squared; heartbeat still thundering.</p><p>Behind her, Rio exhaled like she’d just stepped off the battlefield.</p><p>Because she had.</p><p>And she’d go back to it again in a heartbeat, it is meant getting her alone again.</p>

<p>The morning air was crisp, the kind of clean that only existed before sunrise – before the press briefings, the state calls, the war planning. Rio’s boots crunched against the gravel of the South Lawn’s private trail, each stride controlled, deliberate, mechanical.</p><p>As if the feeling of Agatha’s hands all over her wasn’t still burning her skin. As if the memory of how responsive she was, how easily she crumbled just like Rio wasn’t fresh on her mind. As if she couldn’t wait for the next moment, they would be alone.</p><p>Beside her, Alice stretched one arm across her chest, ponytail swinging behind her like a metronome.</p><p>“You good?” Alice asked, her breath fogging in the cool February air.</p><p>Rio grunted. “Fine.”</p><p>“Uh huh.” Alice turned slightly, looking at her sideways. “You didn’t sleep.”</p><p>“I don’t sleep much.”</p><p>“You also forgot your thigh holster.”</p><p>Rio glanced down. She had. Dammit.</p><p>Alice’s lips quirked. “So, unless you’re planning to karate chop an assassin with your knee, I’m going to go ahead and call the bullshit on ‘fine’.”</p><p>Before Rio could answer, the residence doors opened.</p><p>And there she was.</p><p>Agatha Harkness.</p><p>The President of the United States. The woman who had moaned Rio’s name like it was a sacrament just hours ago.</p><p>She stepped out in a tailored navy-blue tracksuit, her curls tied up, sleek and powerful. Her running shoes were black with a splash of crimson – subtle, almost poetic. Like blood beneath velvet.</p><p>Rio’s chest tightened.</p><p>Alice whistled under her breath. “Madam President looking presidential as hell.”</p><p>“Watch it,” Rio barked, but her voice lacked any real edge.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes locked with Rio’s across the lawn. Just a flicker. But it was there.</p><p>Oh, she remembers too.</p><p>And fuck, Rio could still feel the heat of her, the press of her hips, the soft rasp of <em>Rio</em> ghosting her lips.</p><p>“You’re staring,” Alice said dryly, stretching her calves now.</p><p>“I am watching my protectee.”</p><p>“You’re watching her like you want to guard her with your mouth.” Alice snorted.</p><p>Rio’s head snapped toward her. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Alice smirked. “Look, I get what it means to want someone you’re not supposed to.” Rio didn’t answer. She couldn’t.</p><p>Because in the seconds after that kiss, before the world snapped back into focus, Agatha hadn’t looked ashamed. She’d looked… alive. Terrified. But alive.</p><p>Agatha jogged over to them with practiced pace. “Morning,” she said smoothly, eyes flicking from Alice to Rio and back again. “Thank you for being ready.”</p><p>“Always.” Alice said brightly.</p><p>Rio simply nodded.</p><p>Agatha took a moment to stretch, her motions precise. Controlled. The elastic waistband of her jacket rode up slightly as she reached overhead, revealing a sliver of skin above her hips. Rio felt the heat crawl up her neck and looked away.</p><p>“Route?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Two laps around the perimeter trail.” Alice said. “We’ve got runners posted along the path and visual comms every 400 yards. Secret Service has thermal perimeter active. The press you requested is vetted and waiting for pictures.”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “Let’s move.”</p><p>The three of them fell into a rhythm – Agatha at the center, Rio lightly behind and left, Alice on the right. For the first five minutes, the only sounds were breath and gravel.</p><p>Then Agatha spoke – casual, measured. “I trust the Situation Room held after I left?”</p><p>“Yelena wanted to punch Steve.” Alice said conversationally. “Again?” Agatha said, lips twitching. “He said her cyber strike plan was reckless,” Rio added flatly.</p><p>“She took offense?”</p><p>“She told him if he wanted to play it safe, he could retire to a bunker in Idaho.” Agatha huffed a small laugh. “That would be why I nominated her.”</p><p>Rio nearly smiled.</p><p>They hit the first bed, the sun beginning to bleed over the eastern sky. The shadows stretched long over the lawn, painting them like giants against the stone walls of power. Agatha’s breathing was even, controlled. She was always in control. But her voice dropped slightly – just for Rio.</p><p>“Rough night?” She asked, feigning indifference.</p><p>Rio didn’t answer right away. Her body was warm now, not from the run – but from the memory. The feeling of Agatha’s hands. The way her voice cracked when she said, <em>“I have been alone a long time Rio.” </em></p><p>“I’ve had worse,” Rio said eventually.</p><p>“That’s not what I asked.”</p><p>Alice suddenly slowed behind them. “I am giving you two fifteen second. If you kiss, I want hazard pay.”</p><p>“Wu.” Rio barked.</p><p>“Counting down.” Alice grinned, veering slightly off the path towards a nearby comms post.</p><p>Agatha kept running, smooth and unhurried. Her voice was velvet and entirely too calm. “I don’t regret it.”</p><p>The words landed like a low blow, knocking the wind out of Rio more effectively than the run ever could. It was cruel almost – how casually Agatha dropped bombs like that. But there was heat under the surface, banked like embers under ash.</p><p>“I do regret,” Agatha added, slower now, her breath perfectly measured, “that is ended when it did?” Rio’s lungs burned and not from exertion.</p><p>She kept her gaze forward, muscles coiled tight. “We shouldn’t be talking about this.”</p><p>“But we are,” Agatha said, her voice dipping lower. “And you haven’t stopped thinking about it either.”</p><p>Rio nearly stumbled.</p><p>Agatha kept her pace steady, predatory. Controlled. Her tone was soft, but the tension behind it was razor sharp. Another bend. Another stretch of silence, broken only by the pounding of their feet, the rustle of wind through leaves, the buzz of tension building like a storm surge.</p><p>And then Agatha whispered it. A question dressed like temptation:</p><p>“If I asked you to kiss me again – off duty, in a room with no cameras, no protocols, no rules – would you?”</p><p>Rio didn’t get a chance to answer as Alice jogged back up to them. Just steeled her expression and resolve as she picked up the pace.</p><p>Because the truth was yes. God, yes.</p><p>She would push Agatha up against the door, peel that suit from her body like it personally offended her, get on her knees, and devour her with the desperation she kept locked behind a thousand rules of conduct. She would kiss her until Agatha forgot her title, forgot her legacy, forgot everything but Rio’s mouth.</p><p>She clenched her fists and kept running.</p><p>Because duty still outranked desire.</p><p>Rio didn’t look at her. Her jaw was tight, breath shallow. Agatha didn’t press. Didn’t need too.</p><p>--</p><p>They returned to the East Residence, shoes crunching on the polished stone as the sun crept over the horizon. The run had done nothing to burn off the heat simmering beneath Rio’s skin – not the tight ache in her thighs, not the sting of the cold air against her flushed face. It lived somewhere deeper, somewhere in her just where Agatha’s voice still lingered like smoke.</p><p>
<em>If I asked you to kiss me again…</em>
</p><p>Jesus.</p><p>The doors closed behind them with a soft click, and silence swallowed the space. No aides. No press. Just pale morning light bleeding in through high windows and the three of them moving across the entry hall like nothing was unraveling under their skin.</p><p>Alice peeled off her windbreaker with a dramatic groan. “Remind me next time to fake an ankle injury and call it a day. I thought you wanted a PR photo op, not a half-marathon.”</p><p>Agatha, who’d maintained a steady, effortless pace for the entire run, raised an elegant brow. “I did say two laps.”</p><p>“That was four,” Alice mutters. “One for NATO, one for the press, one for your ghostwriter, and one for cardio trauma.”</p><p>Rio said nothing, stripping her gloves in slow, controlled motions. Every move had to be deliberate now. Every breath measured. Because Agatha was still standing too close, and Rio couldn’t trust her body not to betray her if it got even a taste of what it wanted.</p><p>Alice turned toward them, water bottle in hand. “Is it just me, or was the air between you two spicy as hell this morning?”</p><p>Rio stiffened. “What?”</p><p>“Oh, come on.” Alice pointed between them like she was diagnosing a case of coiled tension. “I’ve seen less charged chemistry in spy thrillers. You were running like a pair of panthers stalking each other.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched – not quite a smile, not quite a denial.</p><p>“I wasn’t aware you moonlighted as a gossip columnist, Agent Wu,” she said smoothly.</p><p>“I don’t,” Alice replied cheerfully, “but I do watch people for a living, and you two were broadcasting a frequency I haven’t heard since that time Yelena threatened to ‘retrain’ Lilia in a broom closet.”</p><p>“Jesus, Alice.” Rio nearly choked.</p><p>“Don’t Jesus me, you know I am right.”</p><p>Agatah turned away, calmly unzipping her jacket with the same kind of precision she used to dismantle foreign policy on camera. “We were running. It’s a morning routine. That’s all.”</p><p>“Mmmm,” Alice said. “Sure. Except it felt less like a routine and more like foreplay. You two didn’t talk for three miles and somehow still managed to eye-fuck each other the entire time.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw locked. “You’re imagining things.”</p><p>“Am I?” Alice tilted her head. “Because at one point, you almost tripped over your own feet when the President adjusted her ponytail.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow turned towards Rio. “I wasn’t aware that my hair was such a hazard.”</p><p>Alice grinned. “Ma’am your hair could start wars.”</p><p>Just then, the heavy wood door behind them swung open with sharp purpose.</p><p>Jen walked in holding a tablet in one hand, blazer half-buttoned and a coffee she looked moments away from throwing at someone. She paused just inside the room and took stock in two seconds flat – the flushed President, the stiff-necked agent, and the unusually cheerful second agent standing far too casually between them.</p><p>Her eyes narrowed.</p><p>“Do I even want to know what’s going on?”</p><p>“Nope.” Alice spoke instantly. “Just finishing the world’s most intense group jog.”</p><p>Jen didn’t move. Her gaze flicked between Agatha and Rio like she was cataloging micro expressions for a report to God. “Uh-huh. And is there a reason both of you look like you just committed treason?”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “We ran. That’s it.”</p><p>Agatha folded her towel neatly over her arm. “It’s part of the optics package. Appear strong. Present. In control.”</p><p>“You’re also sweating like a woman trying to escape a confession,” Jen muttered, staring at her tablet but not reading it. “And you...” She looked directly at Rio, “..., have your ‘I didn’t touch anything’ face on.”</p><p>Alice raised a brow, “She has a face for that?”</p><p>Jen ignored her. “I don’t like whatever this is.”</p><p>“It’s not anything,” Agatha said crisply. “Alice, would you get the gate report for me before the morning brief?”</p><p>“Sure thing.” Alice smiled, mock saluting Jen before walking out of the door.</p><p>Jen sighed. “I have to go to a meeting. But Madam President please be in the Situation Room in 10 minutes.” With that she turned on a heel, walking out of the door.</p><p>“We can’t do this,” she said. It sounded like a plea. A warning. A prayer.</p><p>Agatha stepped closer – slow, sure, unrattled even now. “I don’t care.”</p><p>“That’s the problem, Rio said quietly. “Because I do.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her like a woman unraveling the threads she’d sworn to keep intact. “Then don’t kiss me.”</p><p>It was a challenge.</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Didn’t speak.</p><p>Didn’t breathe.</p><p>Because Agatha’s voice still echoed in her chest, low and provocative and almost cruel in its softness: <em>Then don’t kiss me</em>.</p><p>It was a line drawn in the sand – an invitation dressed as a warning.</p><p>And Rio was already halfway across it.</p><p>She stared at her, barely keeping the storm off her face. Agatha, flushed from the run, hair curling against her temples, looked every inch the danger she was. The danger Rio wanted. Needed. Couldn’t have.</p><p>“I’m serious.” Rio said, voice hoarse. “You can’t just say shit like that and expect me to act like your fucking bodyguard five minutes later.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “You have never been just my bodyguard, Rio.”</p><p>That name again. Spoken like a secret. Like a sin.</p><p>Rio’s fists clenched at her sides.</p><p>She took one breath.</p><p>Then two.</p><p>She leaned in, voice a rasp, barely audible over the ticking clock on the wall. “You keep pushing me like this, and one day I won’t stop.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flickered, darkening, lips parting just slightly, “The challenge still stands.”</p><p>A voice rang out from the hallway, echoing off the marble.</p><p>“Ma’am? You’ve got Lilia on hold and Steve Rogers pacing like he’s about to invade France.”</p><p>Jen. Again. Because of course.</p><p>Agatha straightened instantly, spine snapping into presidential posture, her expression smoothing like silk.</p><p>“On my way,” She called back, her voice clear and controlled – like she hadn’t just been standing in a gravitation pull of a woman who wanted her too much.</p><p>She looked at Rio one last time. No mask this time. Just eyes filled with things unsaid.</p><p>--</p><p>The Situation Room was already buzzing by the time Agatha entered.</p><p>Screens lit the walls with satellite feeds, encrypted messages, border overlays. A digital map of Eastern Europe glowed red at the edges- Sokovia pulsing at the center like a festering wound.</p><p>Steve Rogers stood near the head of the table, arms folded across his chest, jaw tight. Lilia Calderu tapped through briefing slides on her tablet. Monica Rambeau, already mid-call, gave a quick nod toward Agatha before muting her line.</p><p>Everyone snapped to attention.</p><p>“Madam President,” Steve said.</p><p>Agatha nodded. “What do we know?”</p><p>Monica disconnected her headset. “Multiple sources confirm the cell responsible for the motorcade attack had ties to a defunct intelligence faction operating out of old Sokovian military infrastructure. They’re not clean state operatives- they’re mercenary, mobile, and ideological.”</p><p>“Worse than soldiers,” Lilia added. “They don’t want concessions. They want collapse. Chaos.”</p><p>Steve pointed to the display. “We have three plays, ma’am. Cyber disruption. Surgical sabotage. Or indirect destabilization through third-party proxies.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes flicked between the options.</p><p>“And the risk with each?”</p><p>“Cyber’s clean,” Monica said. “But it escalates our visibility. They’ll know it’s us, even if we keep it off the record.”</p><p>“Surgical hits could backfire,” Steve admitted. “Collateral. Optics. We misstep once, and NATO thinks you’ve gone full cowboy.”</p><p>“Proxy destabilization?” Agatha asked.</p><p>Lilia met her gaze evenly. “Slow. Effective. But it doesn’t feel like justice. Not publicly. The press will tear into it.”</p><p>Silence stretched for a beat.</p><p>Then Agatha exhaled, folding her arms as she studied the map again. Her voice was low, composed. “Give me full scenarios for each. Escalation charts, fallback contingencies. I want all three pathways rendered by noon.”</p><p>“Yes, ma’am,” Monica said instantly.</p><p>“Also,” Agatha added, her gaze narrowing on a blinking node near the Black Sea. “I want updated fleet positioning in the region. If Sokovia thinks they can dance on my soil without consequence, I want them to hear the boots circling the ballroom.”</p><p>Steve offered a faint smile. “Understood.”</p><p>Lilia added, “You’ll have Lithuanian and Romanian channels prepped by the hour. Both are twitchy. They want to help, but not if it looks like war.”</p><p>Agatha nodded once. “Make it look like strategy. That’s what we’re selling.”</p><p>And just like that, the room snapped into movement.</p><p>Orders issued. Data transferred. War games ignited beneath the surface.</p><p>But Agatha stood still for a long second, fingers drumming once against the table before falling silent. Then, almost casually:</p><p>“I want the gym cleared.”</p><p>Everyone looked up.</p><p>“Excuse me?” Lilia blinked.</p><p>Agatha turned, calm and unwavering. “Twenty minutes. Rio, Alice, and- what’s his name- Agent McCrae. The MMA champ.”</p><p>Steve raised an eyebrow. “You’re… sparring?”</p><p>“I’m not starting a war before I’ve punched something,” Agatha said simply. “And no offense to the National Security Council, but none of you qualify.”</p><p>She turned to leave.</p><p>“Ma’am,” Jen called from the hall as she passed, tablet in hand. “Do I even want to know-?”</p><p>“Nope,” Agatha said. “Tell Rogers to get me mat clearance.”</p><p>Jen stared after her. “I hate this job.”</p><p>--</p><p>The lights overhead buzzed to life, throwing sharp angles across the padded floor.</p><p>Agatha stepped onto the mat barefoot, sleeves of her navy athletic top pushed to her elbows, hair twisted into a tight knot. She looked every inch the stateswoman- until she rolled her shoulders and cracked her knuckles.</p><p>Rio stood to one side, jaw tight, hair damp from the shower she barely had time to finish. Alice was grinning like Christmas had come early. McCrae, tall and broad and built like a truck, looked unsure whether this was a prank or a trap.</p><p>“Rules?” Alice asked, bouncing slightly on her toes.</p><p>“None,” Agatha said.</p><p>McCrae blinked. “Wait, ma’am, with respect-”</p><p>Agatha moved before he finished. Quick, efficient, fluid. Her heel swept out low, fast as a whip, knocking McCrae off balance. He caught himself, barely, and let out a startled breath.</p><p>“She’s serious,” Rio muttered.</p><p>“Understatement of the year,” Alice grinned, circling in.</p><p>Agatha glanced at Rio. “You’re last.”</p><p>Rio’s brows lifted. “You are saving the best for last or just trying to piss me off?”</p><p>Agatha smiled- sharp and unrepentant. “Why not both?”</p><p>The padded floor was cool beneath bare feet, and the air held the faint scent of sweat, vinyl, and adrenaline.</p><p>Agatha stepped to the center of the mat like she belonged there- like war rooms and diplomacy were just a different kind of combat. She rolled her neck once, loosened her shoulders, and fixed her gaze on Agent McCrae.</p><p>“Let’s begin,” she said calmly.</p><p>McCrae hesitated, clearly unsure how to proceed with sparring the President. “Ma’am, I really don’t-”</p><p>Agatha struck first.</p><p>A low, fluid kick swept toward his knee- not hard enough to damage, but enough to test his reflexes. He dodged, barely. Then her fist came next - quick and sharp, just brushing his shoulder as he pivoted. The message was clear: <em>take me seriously or get embarrassed.</em></p><p>McCrae adjusted quickly, coming in with a grappling hold. Agatha let him close, then shifted her weight and flipped him onto the mat with a practiced sweep of her leg. He landed with a dull thud, breath huffed from his lungs.</p><p>Alice whistled. “And <em>that</em> is why you don’t underestimate a woman who’s negotiated missile treaties.”</p><p>McCrae groaned. “Permission to never do that again, ma’am?”</p><p>Agatha offered him a hand up, not unkind. “Granted.”</p><p>Next came Alice.</p><p>The energy shifted immediately. Alice grinned like she’d been waiting her whole career for sanctioned hand-to-hand combat with the Commander-in-Chief. She bounced on the balls of her feet, then lunged.</p><p>Agatha dodged the first strike but blocked the second. Alice was fast- deceptively fast- and had no hesitation about aiming high. Elbow, palm, knee. She came in hot, playful but focused.</p><p>Agatha matched her, not with brute strength but with flow- redirecting momentum, turning strikes into openings. It was more dance than fight, sparking laughter from Alice when Agatha caught her wrist mid-swing and twisted her into a lock.</p><p>“Okay!” Alice laughed breathlessly. “I surrender. Jesus. I’m going to need a chiropractor and a therapist.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curved slightly. “Both are on staff. You’ll be fine.”</p><p>Then, finally-</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha said, turning slowly.</p><p>The room changed.</p><p>Alice stepped back without a word, and even McCrae went quiet. Rio rolled her shoulders back, hands flexing slightly. She stepped onto the mat, controlled, coiled, like every nerve in her body was waiting for permission to explode.</p><p>No one spoke.</p><p>The room was hot with breath and friction, the padded floor slick under bare feet. The others had faded into the periphery. This wasn’t sparring anymore. This was something else. Something primal. Something personal.</p><p>Agatha and Rio circled like predators – silent, coiled, and absolutely locked on each other.</p><p>Agatha struck first. A sharp low kick. A palm to the shoulder. Clean, precise – too clean. Rio blocked with equal skill, but her eyes never left Agatha’s. She could already feel it – that look. Mischief buried under calculation.</p><p>“You’ve been holding back,” Agatha murmured, just loud enough for Rio to hear.</p><p>“I was being respectful,” Rio replied, dodging a hook.</p><p>Agatha smirked, “I am not going to break Rio. You can be rough with me.” Rio faltered, her throat catching at the words that left Agatha’s mouth.</p><p>She moved again – sweeping under Rio’s arm, catching her from the side, fingers grazing Rio’s waist longer than necessary. Rio inhaled sharply, her balance wavering for half a second. Agatha used it, slamming them both down to the mat, landing astride her hips.</p><p>Straddling her.</p><p>“You’re distracted,” Agatha whispered, breath brushing Rio’s ear. “Am I in your head, Agent Vidal?”</p><p>Rio growled low in her throat. She bucked, grabbed Agatha’s thigh, twisted –</p><p>And flipped her.</p><p>Now it was Rio on top.</p><p>Agatha’s back hit the mat with a sharp exhale – but it wasn’t pain that left her lips. It was a moan. Soft. Barely audible. But it curled around Rio’s spine like heat.</p><p>“God,” Agatha breathed, voice dark and slick. “You’re so good when you stop pretending.”</p><p>“Shut up,” Rio hissed, pinning her wrists.</p><p>Agatha arched beneath her; the contact too close – too much. And then she said it, low and wicked:</p><p>“Good girl.”</p><p>Rio’s pulse <em>slammed</em>.</p><p>Her gripped tightened. Her body pressed harder, thighs caging Agatha’s hips with ruthless control. “Say that again.” She warned, her voice like gravel.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes gleamed, pupils blown wide. “<em>Good girl</em>.” She said slowly, deliberately, almost like she was moaning it.</p><p>She yanked Agatha’s arms high above her head, grinding her hips down just enough to make Agatha gasp again – another one of those sounds, too raw for politics, too wet with want for anywhere but here.</p><p>“You want to play like that?” Rio rasped.</p><p>Agatha, smiled, breathless. “Make me regret it Rio.”</p><p>Rio didn’t kiss her.</p><p>But her body screamed with the want of it.</p><p>Instead, she shifted fast, caught Agatha’s left arm, twisted, and flipped her into a joint lock that had her pinned flat – legs spread, arms trapped.</p><p>“Yield.” Rio demanded.</p><p>Agatha writhed, panting now. “Why would I?” she whispered, “I like it like this.”</p><p>Her voice was wrecked. Ruined. And still laced with power.</p><p>Rio leaned in, her lips at Agatha’s ear now. “Say it.” She commanded.</p><p>Agatha’s breath shuddered, “…Fine.”</p><p>Rio didn’t release her right away. She held her there. Dominating. Owning.</p><p>Until Agatha whispered, this time not teasing – just soft.</p><p>“You win.” Slowly, Rio let go.</p><p>Agatha remained on her back, chest heaving, lips parted. Her hair was wild now, her skin flushed, pupils still wide like she couldn’t come down from the high fast enough. Rio rose, towering over her.</p><p>“I warned you,” she said, voice dark. “I don’t play.”</p><p>Agatha sat up slowly, wiping sweat from her face with the back of her wrist.</p><p>“No,” she murmured. “You devour.”</p><p>From the sidelines, Alice groaned into her hands. “Okay, <em>I</em> need a cigarette. And therapy. And Jesus.”</p><p>McCrae blinked. “Was that even legal?”</p><p>No one answered. Agatha stood at last, posture regal, but her body told another story. Her knees were shaking. And she loved it. So did Rio.</p><p>And the next time they sparred – there wouldn’t be an audience.</p><p>--</p><p>The building had quieted. Most staff were gone. The press pool long dismissed. Only the hum of late-night security and the muted voices of the war room lingered like ghosts through the marble halls.</p><p>Rio stood at her usual post- hands clasped behind her back, jacket unzipped just enough to breathe. Her body was still sore from the sparring match, from holding Agatha down, from <em>not</em> doing what every nerve had begged her to do.</p><p>It had been a long day.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t spoken to her directly since.</p><p>Not in the Situation Room. Not in the briefings. Not during the midday meeting with the Lithuanian ambassador. She’d remained presidential. Sharp. Flawless. Cold when she needed to be, soft when she chose.</p><p>But not once did she look at Rio.</p><p>Not until now.</p><p>The door to the Oval opened quietly. Jen stepped out first, flipping through notes on a secure tablet, muttering under her breath. Alice was behind her, eating something that looked like the world’s saddest protein bar.</p><p>And then Agatha followed.</p><p>Hair perfectly pinned. Navy suit tailored to hell. A folder in one hand, heels clicking softly on the runner. She didn’t speak to Jen. Didn’t even glance at Alice.</p><p>She looked at Rio.</p><p>Just once.</p><p>A long, measured glance.</p><p>Not quick. Not professional. Not accidental.</p><p>Her eyes moved from Rio’s boots… up her legs… paused at her waist… lingered at her chest.</p><p>And then landed on her mouth.</p><p><em>That</em> was the moment.</p><p>She didn’t smile. She didn’t blink.</p><p>She just stared.</p><p>And Rio felt it like gravity shifting under her skin.</p><p>Then Agatha’s gaze met hers fully, and she tilted her head- just a little. A silent challenge. A dangerous invitation. One corner of her mouth twitched, almost imperceptible.</p><p>
<em>Do it again.</em>
</p><p>Agatha’s eyes stayed locked on Rio’s for a heartbeat longer.</p><p>Then – like flipping a switch – she turned to Jen, calm and composed. “Reschedule the 8:00 with Defense for the morning. I want updated satellite scans on the western corridor first.”</p><p>Jen didn’t miss a beat. “Already in motion. Do you want to loop in Lilia again?”</p><p>Agatha nodded, walking forward. “Not yet. I want Romania’s readout first. If they start waffling, we’ll use Lithuania as leverage.”</p><p>Alice followed them without a word, still munching her protein bar like this was just another Thursday.</p><p>Rio stepped into formation behind them, her body taut, her heartbeat thunderous in her ears.</p><p>Because Agatha didn’t look back.</p><p>Not once.</p><p>Not even after that <em>look</em>- the one that had said <em>do it again</em> with devastating, unspoken clarity. Like she hadn’t just dragged her eyes down Rio’s body. Like she hadn’t issued a command Rio <em>wanted</em> to follow more than she wanted to breathe.</p><p>They moved through the dim halls in silence – Jen updating, Agatha nodding, Alice joking quietly to herself. But Rio didn’t hear a word of it.</p><p>She was stuck in that stare.</p><p>In the heat of it.</p><p>The promise of it.</p><p>She followed them through the West Wing, down the private corridor connecting to the Residence, past the last lingering staffers and into the shadowed hush of power’s inner sanctum.</p><p>Security waved them through without question.</p><p>No one asked why the President wasn’t speaking. No one questioned why her bodyguard looked like she was walking to her own damn execution.</p><p>Agatha didn’t slow until they reached the double doors of the private residence. Jen peeled off with a quiet, “I’ll have the reports on your desk by six, ma’am.”</p><p>Agatha nodded without turning.</p><p>Alice gave Rio a side glance – something wry and unspoken – but mercifully kept her mouth shut this time.</p><p>Then she, too, disappeared down another hallway.</p><p>Leaving just the two of them.</p><p>Agatha stepped through the doors. Didn’t look back.</p><p>But she left them open.</p><p>And Rio followed.</p><p>In silence.</p><p>In obedience.</p><p>In heat.</p>

<p>The door shut with a soft click behind Rio.</p><p>Not slammed. Not locked.</p><p>Just shut.</p><p>And somehow, that silence was louder than a gunshot.</p><p>Agatha didn’t turn. She stood near the tall windows, the city twinkling far beyond the glass. One hand rested lightly on the sill. Her suit jacket had come off sometimes during the walk back, and now only the soft line of her blouse clung to her spine, the muscles beneath it taught with tension. Her heels still on.</p><p>And she didn’t say a word.</p><p>Not <em>thank you. </em>Not <em>good night.</em></p><p>Just silence. The same silence she’d used in the Situation Room – weaponized now, turned inward.</p><p>Rio stood in the entryway, locking the door behind her. Her body still buzzing. Her hands still clenched. That – look <em>do it again</em> – still carved into her ribs. “Say something.” She rasped. Agatha turned then, slowly.</p><p>Her expression unreadable, but her eyes were fire. Not diplomatic, not presidential.</p><p>Just her.</p><p>“I don’t need to,” Agatha said. “You already know what I want.” Rio swallowed hard. “You gave me an order.”</p><p>“Yes,” Agatha said, stepping closer, her voice velvet-wrapped steel. “And you followed. Like a good girl.” Rio’s breath caught. Agatha saw it. Smiled. Cruel and perfect.</p><p>“You like that, don’t you?” She whispered. “When I tell you what to do.”</p><p>Rio moved fast. One step. Two.</p><p>She caught Agatha by the waist and slammed her against the door with a. thud, their bodies colliding like a dam finally bursting.</p><p>And when Agatha’s back hit the wall with a satisfying thud, she didn’t flinch. She <em>smiled</em>.</p><p>God, she was dangerous.</p><p>Within seconds they were devouring each other. Rio's hands thoroughly undoing the woman beneath her.</p><p>Her navy skirt was rumpled, twisted around her hips, the zipper half-undone. Her silk blouse clung to her in sweat-damp patches, the top buttons torn loose from Rio’s earlier grip. Exposing the tops of her breasts, flushed and heaving beneath a lace bra that looked more like something stolen from a dream than a drawer. Her lipstick was half-smeared. Her hair had fallen out of its bun and was in wild curls.</p><p>But her spine was still straight, her jaw still set with command.</p><p>Beautiful.</p><p>Untouchable.</p><p>And completely wrecked.</p><p>Rio was already on her – one hand braced beside Agatha’s head, the other gripping her hip hard enough to bruise. Their mouths collided again, all tongue and hunger, devouring in a rhythm to wild to fake.</p><p>Agatha gasped into her, nails dragging down the front of Rio’s tank top, catching the hem and pulling it up, exposing carved lines of muscles, and boxers disappearing into the waistband of tactical pants.</p><p>Rio’s abs flexed as Agatha’s nails raked down them.</p><p>“You’re unreal,” Agatha murmured, fingers tracing each defined ridge like she was memorizing the map of a battlefield. “You’ve been walking around with this under a suit the whole time?”</p><p>Rio grinned against her throat where she bit softly. “Only for you.”</p><p>She bit down lightly on Agatha’s collarbone, then dragged her tongue over it. Agatha’s head lolled back.</p><p>“This what you needed sweetheart?” Rio growled, Agatha choking out a moan at the pet name. “Someone to take control after you spent all damn day pretending you still, have it?” Agatha moaned again – soft and wicked – and tilted her head back. “That mouth.” Agatha breathed. “Keep talking.”</p><p>Rio dragged her thigh between Agatha’s legs and <em>pressed</em>. “I bet you’ve been dripping since the gym,” she said, voice like gravel. “You got off on me pinning you down, didn’t you? You liked the whole room watching me ruin you.”</p><p>Agatha whimpered and rutted forward seeking something, “God – yes.”</p><p>“Look at you,” Rio growled, dragging Agatha by the hips to the nearest piece of furniture – a polished side table just inside the residence door. “You’re the one who couldn’t wait to get your hands on me.” Agatha moaned out, trying to level the playing field.</p><p>Rio tossed Agatha back, fast but controlled, so her ass hit the edge of the table, and her legs fell open with a groan. The skirt rode up her waist, revealing lace panties soaked through, her thighs trembling with anticipation.</p><p>“I poke and prod at you, trying to push your buttons,” Agatha growled out, “You finally give in. And it’s because I ignored you after I riled you up? Does it make you feel all big and strong?”</p><p>Agatha sprawled back, blouse barely hanging on, one strap fallen over her shoulder, the other pushed down to reveal the full swell of one breast, nipple outline beneath black lace. Her body was flushed, sweat-kissed, glowing. And she wasn’t done provoking Rio yet.</p><p>As Rio tried to step between her legs, Agatha stuck one heeled foot out, stopping her at her hip. Rio didn’t push or move accepting the boundary but still looking at Agatha like she wanted to devour her whole.</p><p>“Answer me Rio.” Agatha demanded the power and control in her voice steady as she stared her down. “I can see how badly you want me.” Agatha breathed out, her half-lidded eyes raking up Rio. “But don’t think you’re the one in control here.”</p><p>Rio growled swatted Agatha’s foot away, surging forward her kiss biting as she threaded one hand through Agatha’s wild locks, the other gripping Agatha’s hip with bruising force. She broke the kiss, trailing her lips down Agatha’s throat, nipping before soothing it with her tongue.</p><p>“You wanted this, didn’t you?” Rio muttered, dragging her tongue up the side of Agatha’s throat biting just below her ear, the whimper Agatha’s released was downright sinful. Every time you said my name like it was a goddamn prayer – you were begging for this.”</p><p>“I didn’t beg,” Agatha snapped her voice more in control then Rio had ever felt in her lifetime, hips twitching forward. “I ordered.”</p><p>Rio smirked against her pale skin. “Then tell me again.” She accentuated with a bite to Agatha’s collarbone, using her grip in her hair to angle her head back and the hand at her hip pulling her forward to the edge of the table making her grind into Rio’s stomach.</p><p>“Tell me to wreck you.” Rio growled, pulling her head back looking into Agatha’s eyes.</p><p>Agatha met her gaze, voice rough. “Get on your knees and make me scream, Agent Vidal.”</p><p>Rio didn’t hesitate. “Yes, Madam President.”</p><p>She dropped between her legs, hands gripping those toned thighs and pulling her forward. She left bruising bites, kissing and sucking her way to the apex of Agatha’s thighs. Agatha threaded one hand through her hair, the other gripping the edge of the table for support.</p><p>Agatha moaned out, “Rio if you don’t…” The agent between her knees licked one broad stripe up her lace underwear, effectively shutting Agatha Harkness up. She tore the panties off with her teeth before looking up, just once, just making sure she was ok.</p><p>Agatha looked down at her with a look neither of them were ready to decipher before giving a small nod.</p><p>And then Rio <em>devoured </em>her.</p><p>No teasing. No mercy.</p><p>Agatha cried out – head thrown back, curls sticking to her sweat – slicked neck – while Rio mouthed at her like she’d die if she stopped. Tongue deep, rhythmic, greedy. Her hands flexed against Agatha’s hips, fingertips digging into soft, flushed skin, holding her still.</p><p>“You tasted like fucking victory,” Rio murmured almost to herself. “No wonder you’re so powerful.”</p><p>Agatha’s body arched, her moans turning hoarse. “God – Rio, don’t stop, fuck – don’t…”</p><p>“I am just getting started,” She moaned into the president as she felt a sharp tug at her hair, effectively shutting her up and shoving her impossibly deeper. One hand left the President’s thigh, snaking under her chin teasing her entrance.</p><p>Rio started a punishing rhythm, Agatha’s body singing to her as her heels dug into the Agent’s shoulders. She felt the way Agatha clenched around her, fluttering to tell her how close the President was. And Rio was certain she would die happy right here.</p><p>With one final curl against that sweet spot, Agatha came hard and fast, spilling into Rio as she rode her orgasm. Agatha became too sensitive yanking Rio off her and pulling her up, licking a broad path across Rio’s chin, moaning at the taste of herself.</p><p>“God, I do taste good.” Even post best orgasm of her life Agatha was smug, Rio moaned as Agatha sucked her bottom lip releasing it with a pop.</p><p>Agatha was shaking, hair wild, breasts exposed, one strap of her bra dangling around her elbow. She looked like she’d just come off a battlefield.</p><p>And Rio had won.</p><p>But she wasn’t done.</p><p>She lifted her – arms strong under the curve of Agatha’s thighs and back – and carried her across the room.</p><p>“You’re staring.” Agatha rasped.</p><p>“I should,” Rio said, voice thick. “You’re the most beautiful person I’ve ever fucking seen.”</p><p>She kicked open the bedroom door, not caring if it broke, throwing Agatha onto the bed. “Get undressed.” She commanded, shedding the rest of her clothes before helping Agatha tear off her.</p><p>She crawled up the bed settling between Agatha’s legs like that was wear she belonged for the rest of her life. Rio kissed Agatha, slower, surer, her tongue exploring her mouth as Rio slipped her hand back between her thighs.</p><p>“Beg for it.” She commanded in that soft tone. As if it wasn’t going to completely undo Agatha.</p><p>And Agatha did. “Please,” she gasped, “Please, I need to come again. Make me come Rio. <em>Please</em>.”</p><p>Rio obeyed.</p><p>Agatha shattered again. The rhythm slow and steady, unspoken, completely ruining both. And when she breathed out, “I’m – I’m to – sensitive.” Rio finally released her showering her body with soft kisses.</p><p>Agatha didn’t let her stay that way for long because as soon as Rio kissed her mouth, she flipped them with surprising power and ease. She slid down Rio’s body, marking every part of her she could until Rio was the one writhing and begging.</p><p>Agatha Harkness settled between her legs, looking Rio in her eyes as she licked one broad stripe up Rio’s center, sucking her clit into her mouth with practiced ease. Agatha Harkness devoured her with the same precision the President exuded to the world.</p><p>Rio arched back.</p><p>“Your mouth – fuck…”</p><p>Agatha moaned, vibrations echoing and through her entire body.</p><p>Rio tangled her hands into Agatha’s curls, helpless now, groaning as the older woman entered her with two fingers.</p><p>“Fuck, you’re going to make me come.” Rio whined.</p><p>“Good.” Agatha rasped before diving back in.</p><p>And Rio shattered.</p><p>Hard. Loud. Agatha’s name on her lips like a prayer.</p><p>Agatha licked up every drop, before slowly crawling her way back up, smug and undone.</p><p>“Now we’re even.”</p><p>She kissed the corner of Rio’s mouth, brushing her hands over Rio’s abs, causing her to clench.</p><p>“We should break protocol for that again sometime,” Agatha murmured.</p><p>Rio huffed, trying to catch her breath. “That wasn’t protocol. That was an explosion of every rule. That was a war.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, coming to lay next to Rio on her side facing her. “I won.”</p><p>Rio laughed softly. “No, you didn’t.”</p><p>Their eyes met. The look between them wasn’t just heat. It was <em>loaded</em>. A thousand implications. A thousand things neither of them had said but both understood. They would never be able to stay away from each other now.</p><p>Before either could ruin it with words, Rio’s phone buzzed violently on the hardwood floor beside the discarded pile of her pants. She blinked, heart still pounding, and stooped to grab it. The screen glared back at her.</p><p>
<strong>Alice:</strong>
</p><p>
<em>Where the hell are you? POTUS schedule just shifted. You’re needed.</em>
</p><p>Then another:</p><p>
<em>I swear to God if you’re napping again in the surveillance blind spot I will taze you.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s stomach twisted.</p><p>She straightened slowly, moving to put her close back on, running a hand through her hair. Agatha had pulled herself to sit against the headboard, arms crossed against her chest watching her. Still radiant. Still smug. Still undone in the worst, most dangerous way. “You have to go.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio zipped her pants tucking her shirt in. “Duty calls.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes darkened. “We will need to talk about this.”</p><p>Rio hesitated, then nodded once. “Of course.”</p><p>The corner of Agatha’s mouth curved up – slow, sharp, private. “Ok then.”</p><p>And with that, Rio grabbed her jacket, her security earpiece, and walked out of the Residence, rebuilding herself from the inside out.</p><p>But as the door clicked shut behind her, she realized something bone deep.</p><p>
<em>She wasn’t sure she’d ever be able to look at Agatha in daylight again.</em>
</p><p>--</p><p>The morning air was too cold.</p><p>Rio’s body still ached – not from the sleepless night. From what happened prior. From everything that had been said without being said. From the taste and feel of Agatha still burned into her.</p><p>She stood at the at the entrance to the residence, stretching in silence, trying to burn off the tension. The White House was just starting to stir behind her – lights coming on in windows, the subtle buzz of early shift agents checking in. Normalcy was settling in around her like a trap.</p><p>And then she heard it.</p><p>The click of the door shutting. The sound of breath, steady and low.</p><p>Agatha.</p><p>Walking towards them in fitted navy leggings and a zipped training jacket that hugged her body too well. Her hair was in a ponytail again, sleek, efficient, controlled.</p><p>Like nothing had happened.</p><p>Like she hadn’t come four times under Rio’s hands and mouth less than seven hours ago.</p><p>Alice was beside her, chatting easily, sipping from a green smoothie cup and already rolling her eyes at something Agatha had said.</p><p>Rio walked up to them taking a deep breath.</p><p>“Oh, thank God,” Alice said when she spotted Rio. “There she is. Agent Vidal, the vanishing myth. Glad to see you decided to rejoin the land of the competent.”</p><p>Rio cleared her throat. “Yeah, Morning Madam President.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look directly at her. “Morning Agent.”</p><p>Cool. Neutral. Civil.</p><p>It felt like getting slapped.</p><p>Alice bumped Rio with her elbow. “You look like shit. You, okay?”</p><p>“I didn’t sleep much.”</p><p>“You never sleep much,” Alice replied. “But this is more like ‘haunted by the ghost of very good sex’ not sleeping.”</p><p>Rio’s spine stiffened.</p><p>Agatha started the jog, eyes locked on a distant tree. Not a twitch. Not a smile.</p><p>Rio and Alice fell into place with her, keeping the pace.</p><p>Alice kept going. “What, was it a Tinder date? Oh God, was it Yelena again? Please tell me you learned your lesson.”</p><p>Rio said nothing.</p><p>Agatha still hadn’t looked at her.</p><p>But her pace shifted – just slightly. A subtle acceleration. The kind of thing only Rio would notice.</p><p>Alice, oblivious, snorted. “Seriously, though. Yelena would be interested in you for sure. She winked at me in the West Wing corridor, asked where you were. Said – and I quote – ‘Tell Rio I want to see her.’”</p><p>Rio clenched her jaw. “She is just trying to get under people’s skin.”</p><p>“Oh, I know,” Alice said. “But honestly, it kind of sounded like she wasn’t bluffing.” Agatha’s voice hitched – barely audible, but unmistakable.</p><p>Rio glanced sideways.</p><p>Agatha’s face was smooth. Too smooth. Lips pressed into a faint line, eyes narrowed on the trail ahead like she was solving a military campaign, not jogging before breakfast. But her voice, when it finally came, was like ice breaking.</p><p>“It seems Agent Vidal has always had a thing for combat-ready women,” Agatha said coolly. “It’s not surprising.”</p><p>Alice blinked, “Wait – what?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t elaborate. She just kept running. But Rio caught it – the flash in her eyes, the sharpness in her voice. That quiet, unmistakable bit that said: <em>This is bothering me.</em></p><p>Alice laughed, still trying to piece it together. “Wow, okay, tension. You two good?”</p><p>Agatha turned her head just enough to let a smile curl the corner of her mouth. “Perfect.”</p><p>The smile didn’t reach her eyes.</p><p>“Let’s move.” She said, crisp and commanding, picking up the pace.</p><p>Rio fell int step beside her. Alice trailed behind, muttering to herself about code names and needing hazard pay for emotional whiplash.</p><p>They ran in silence.</p><p>But every footfall echoed with last night.</p><p>With jealousy. With something possessive and dangerous and utterly unresolved.</p><p>The cool air did nothing to settle Rio’s pulse. Not with Agatha this close. Not with the sound of her breath catching in her throat every time their shoulder’s brushed. Not with the memory of her pressed against the wall, moaning Rio’s name like a confession.</p><p>They reached the first curve in the trail.</p><p>Still no words.</p><p>Rio finally broke. “You, okay?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look at her. “Why wouldn’t I be?</p><p>“Because of last night.”</p><p>“I am compartmentalizing,” Agatha replied. “Just like this job taught me too.”</p><p>That stung. “Is that what you’re calling it?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “What do you want me to say Rio? That it was a mistake? That I regret it?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer.</p><p>Because she didn’t want to hear yes.</p><p>And she wasn’t ready to hear no.</p><p>They kept running. Windless. Wordless.</p><p>Then Agatha’s voice dropped. “After.”</p><p>--</p><p>They peeled off from Alice at the residence entrance.</p><p>Agatha didn’t say goodbye – just walked inside, sharp and wordless, tension rippling from her shoulders like static. Rio followed, close behind, blood still thrumming from the run, the fight they didn’t have, the conversation they didn’t finish.</p><p>As soon as the doors shut behind them, it snapped.</p><p>“Really?” Rio said, voice tight. “You’re going to freeze me out now?”</p><p>Agatha kept walking toward the sitting room, sweat cooling against her skin, her ponytail damp at the base of her neck. She didn’t look back. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p><p>Rio followed. “Don’t give me that. You have been radiated pissed-off energy since Alice opened her mouth about Yelena.”</p><p>Agatha stopped, turned slowly.</p><p>Her workout jacket clung to her like a second skin – unforgiving, zipped halfway up, her breathing shallow and sharp from the sprint. Her face flushed; her lips parted. And her eyes –</p><p>Cold.</p><p>But not empty.</p><p>That was worse, somehow.</p><p>Because Rio knew what lived behind them now – knew what those eyes looked like when they rolled back in pleasure, when they fluttered shut as her fingers curled just right. Knew what Agatha looked like when she held eye contact while devouring Rio.</p><p>And now that was all gone.</p><p>Frozen over.</p><p>Agatha turned fully, arms folding tightly across her chest. “Why would I be pissed off, Rio? Because you slept with someone else?”</p><p>“I didn’t.” Rio’s voice was flat. “You know I didn’t.”</p><p>“Do I?” Agatha said tilting her head. “Because Alice seems confident. She certainly thinks it happening. And you didn’t deny it.”</p><p>“Because I don’t owe her an explanation,” Rio said, stepping forward, “But I owe you one.”</p><p>Agatha barked a laugh. “No, you don’t. That would imply this is something that it’s not.”</p><p>Rio blinked. “You’re really going to pretend last night meant nothing?”</p><p>Agatha’s jaw tightened. “It was sex.”</p><p>“Bullshit.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t respond.</p><p>Rio’s chest rose and fell. Her voice dropped, low and controlled. “Say it didn’t mean anything, and I will walk away right now.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her.</p><p>For a second, her mouth opened like she might say it.</p><p>But then her eyes flickered – just enough to betray the truth. She couldn’t.</p><p>And Rio saw it.</p><p>“You’re jealous.” Rio said quietly.</p><p>Agatha scoffed. “Don’t flatter yourself.”</p><p>Rio stepped closer, crowding into her space. “You are. You hated hearing Yelena’s name come out of my mouth. You flinched.”</p><p>“I flinched,” Agatha repeated, biting the word like it tasted bitter. “You think I’m that fragile?”</p><p>“I think that you’re human.”</p><p>Agatha’s arms dropped to her sides; fists clenched. “You’re the head of my detail Rio. You’re supposed to protect me. Not possess me and undress me like you own me. Not fuck me like I belong to you.”</p><p>“You do. Just like I belong to you.” Rio said before she could stop herself.</p><p>Agatha froze. “No. I don’t. I don’t belong to anyone.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio started before she stopped.</p><p>Agatha looked away. “Even if I wanted it, I can’t afford it. That is an impeachment waiting to happen. More than half the nation is relying on my success.”</p><p>Silence stretched long and taut between them.</p><p>Rio shook her head. “You’d rather burn it down than risk needing someone.”</p><p>“I have always burned it down.” Agatha whispered. “That is how I got here.”</p><p>“And it’s worth it to end up alone?”</p><p>That landed like a slap. Agatha’s face didn’t change, but her breath stuttered.</p><p>And then her phone buzzed. She looked down. The alert was clear from Jess: President need in SitRoom – 10 minutes briefing ahead of 0700 call.</p><p>Of course.</p><p>She looked back up, the mask already slipping back into place – but this time, something cracked behind her eyes.</p><p>“You fucked the President of the United States, Rio,” she said, voice sharp with heat and restraint. “That title doesn’t just go away. I still have a duty to perform. Regardless of my relationship with you. Regardless of whatever the hell that night meant.”</p><p>Rio’s throat worked. “It meant something.”</p><p>Agatha’s voice dropped, cold and final. “Not enough.”</p><p>She turned, something in her face telling Rio that she didn’t mean a word of it.</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>But she was already walking away, spine straight, jaw locked, every step louder than the last.</p><p>“Thank you for your concern, Agent Vidal,” she said without looking back. “You’re dismissed.”</p><p>And just like that she was gone.</p><p>Leaving Rio behind.</p><p> </p>

<strong>Agatha’s POV</strong>
</p><p>Three days.</p><p>That was all it had taken for everything to calcify into silence.</p><p>Not official silence – her staff spoke to her hourly, briefing her on troop movements, foreign response, internal PR. Jen hovered like a hawk, her Chief of Staff precision razor-sharp as ever. Even Alice had stopped trying to crack jokes and instead brought her coffee with a quiet sort of reverence.</p><p>But from Rio?</p><p>Nothing. No glances. No Banter. No whispered, biting remarks at her six.</p><p>Just professionalism.</p><p>Just distance.</p><p>Just pain wrapping in discipline.</p><p>Agatha hated herself for wanting more.</p><p>She sat now at the head of the Situation Room table, stylus in hand, its tip hovering above the encrypted surface of her tablet without writing anything. Briefs scrolled across the screen, maps updated in real time with overlays in red and amber. A slow march of threat indicators growing thicker every hour.</p><p>The Karazin Ridge had always been volatile. A disputed line between Sokovia and its western neighbors, buried under fifty years of treaties no one fully believed in. But this week? Sokovia had stopped pretending.</p><p>No warning. No provocation.</p><p>Just sudden, silent encroachment into neutral territory. She should have seen it coming. Especially after the attack on her.</p><p>But no one had – no one could have – predicted how quickly their troops would move, how methodically they’d erected jammers and outposts, how quietly they’d silenced local communication. No bombast. No press.</p><p>Just control. Something Agatha was currently struggling with.</p><p>Its chiller her more than an open attack would have.</p><p>Still, the world didn’t know yet. Not fully. An until it did, she had razor-thin window to shape the narrative.</p><p>The generals were speaking – offering containment options, diplomatic feelers. She heard their voice, tracked their words.</p><p>But her mind kept drifting.</p><p>To the silence that followed her everywhere now.</p><p>To Rio, standing behind her like she wasn’t burning up inside.</p><p>It was easier to pretend, wasn’t it? That night had been… aberration. An indulgence. A heatwave in the middle of a snowstorm.</p><p>Except it wasn’t.</p><p>Because Agatha felt it – like phantom limb. Her mouth remembered Rio’s taste. Her thighs clenched in memory of those bruising hands. Her chest still ached from the softness afterwards, the way Rio had looked at her like she wasn’t just the President. Like she was <em>hers</em>.</p><p>And now?</p><p>Now they were ice.</p><p>Now Agatha felt alone again.</p><p>But worse, because now she remembered what not alone felt like.</p><p>And she wasn’t sure she’d survive it a second time.</p><p>“Madam, President.” Jen said beside her quiet, but firm.</p><p>Agatha blinked. Sat straighter.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>The general across from her cleared his throat. “As of 0300 hours, Sokovian forces have moved artillery units into Position Echo on the Karazin border. Technically, they haven’t violated international law, but they are daring someone to say otherwise.”</p><p>“And UN response?”</p><p>“Slow. Tentative. No one wants to first the first word, let alone the first shot.”</p><p>Agatha narrowed her eyes at the map.</p><p>“Then we make sure they don’t get to write the script. Increase humanitarian presence in adjacent sectors. Make it clear we’re there to stabilize, not provoke.”</p><p>“Yes ma’am.”</p><p>She nodded, curt and presidential.</p><p>And behind her?</p><p>Still silence.</p><p>Still Rio.</p><p>--</p><p>
<strong>Rio's POV</strong>
</p><p>Three days.</p><p>Rio had endured worse stretches in the field – cold, starvation, interrogations that stretched beyond sleep – but this? This kind of silence? It was the kind that crawled under her skin and rotted her from the inside.</p><p>It was a different kind of brutality.</p><p>Agatha had been perfectly presidential. Perfectly cold. Perfectly professional. She had her briefings. She signed directives. She spoke to her general in clipped, exact tones.</p><p>But not to Rio.</p><p>Rio, who had touched her, tasted her, <em>known </em>her.</p><p>Now she didn’t even get the chance.</p><p>She stood behind the President’s left shoulder in the Situation Room, in the spot she always occupied, invisible to everyone except the woman she could feel like gravity itself. Agatha sat forward slightly, reading a satellite overlay that glared in amber across the encrypted table, lips pressed into a tight, neutral line.</p><p>She clenched the stylus in her hand every now and then. Not enough for the brass to notice, but Rio saw it. Of course she saw it. She noticed everything – like how Agatha’s jaw tightened every time someone mentioned Sokovia. Like the way her fingers curled against the desk just before she spoke, like she needed to physically pull herself together to command a room.</p><p>And then there were the looks.</p><p>Only when she thought no one else was paying attention.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes would flicker toward her – sharp, unblinking, as if Rio were a puzzle she hated having to solve. Or wanted to solve again with her teeth.</p><p>She’d devour her if given the chance. That much was written plain on her face.</p><p>And that was the part that <em>killed</em> Rio. Not the silence. Not even the distance. But the knowing – knowing Agatha still wanted her and was just <em>choosing</em> to burn instead of touch.</p><p>Discipline. Duty. Distance.</p><p>Rio had been trained for all three.</p><p>She’d just never had to apply them to <em>desire</em> before.</p><p>She forced her expression into something close to boredom as the generals continued talking.</p><p>“… Position Echo on the Karazin border. Technically still within disputed territory, but Sokovia has escalated deployment speed significantly. No official statement from their government.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t react. She stared at the map like she could bend it into submission. “And the UN?”</p><p>“Stalling. Waiting for consensus. No one wants to say the first word. Let alone fire the first shot.”</p><p>Rio’s eyes flickered to the edge of the digital overlay. Sokovian red was starting to seep past the buffer line like a bloodstain.</p><p>Agatha leaned forward – elbows on the table. “Increase humanitarian presence. Civilian outreach. I want food drops and medical teams on the ground by 1800 hours. Make it clear we are stabilizing the region – not provoking anyone.”</p><p>“Yes ma’am.”</p><p>She sat back. A picture of resolve. Presidential steel.</p><p>But her thumb grazed the edge of her stylus again. And Rio caught her tongue dart briefly across her bottom lip, like she’d remembered the taste of something – or someone.</p><p>And Rio? She was burning.</p><p>But she said nothing.</p><p>Because that was the job.</p><p>--</p><p>The gym was quiet and smelled faintly like rubber, iron, and sweat. Rio liked it. No press, no protocols, no expectations other than pain and sweat. Which is what she needed.</p><p>Alice hit the mat with a grunt and a thud.</p><p>“For fuck’s sake.” She gasped, lying there with one arm draped dramatically across her chest. “Are you trying to kill me or just prove a point?”</p><p>Rio offered a hand. “You’re the one that asked to spar.”</p><p>Alice took it, letting herself be hauled upright like a sack of flour.  “I didn’t realize you’d be in Terminator mode.”</p><p>“I’m not…”</p><p>“You <em>are</em>, Vidal.” She tossed a punch that Rio almost blocked lazily. “You’re tight. Overthinking. Tense as hell.”</p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose, circling. “I’m fine.”</p><p>Alice smirked. “You sure? Because we’ve sparred before. You’re usually smooth. Scary, but smooth. Now you’re just angry.”</p><p>They traded blows. Rio let Alice get a glancing hit to the ribs before spinning into a counter that left Alice on her back again.</p><p>Alice coughed, winded. “Jesus. Is this about the Sokovian or the President?”</p><p>Rio froze. Just for a second. But Alice saw it.</p><p>“Oh my God,” she groaned, lying back and staring at the ceiling. “You <em>did </em>sleep with her.”</p><p>Rio grabbed a towel, wiping her face. “That is none of your business.”</p><p>“You <em>totally</em> did. Damn.” Alice sat up, face flushed from exertion and excitement. “You going to tell me it was some heated post-assassination-night confession? Or did she just… order you into her bedroom like a very patriotic fairytale?”</p><p>Rio turned to the weight rack and began adjusting plates just to avoid eye contact. “It was a mistake.”</p><p>“Sure, didn’t look like a mistake when she was staring at you in the press briefing yesterday like you were the last glass of water in the desert.”</p><p>Rio tighten the weight collar with too much force.</p><p>Alice got to her feet and leaned on the bench next to her. “Look. I know it’s not simple. Power dynamics. Public optics. National security. But she’s not just the President. She’s a person. And she clearly doesn’t know how to stop wanting you.”</p><p>“She told me to forget it.”</p><p>“And you listened?”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer.</p><p>Alice’s voice softened. “You ever think maybe she pushed you away because it <em>meant </em>something? And she’s terrified?”</p><p>Rio stared down at the weight. “I’m not supposed to feel anything.”</p><p>“But you do.”</p><p>She closed her eyes. “Every second.”</p><p>Alice let that sit. No teasing. No jokes. Just the quiet of the gym and the weight of unspoken truths.</p><p>“So… is now a bad time to ask if I can ship it on a Twitter burner account?”</p><p>Rio choked on a laugh. “You are the worst.”</p><p>“I know,” Alice said with a grin, slinging a towel over her shoulder.” But you’re in love with the President, so I think I win.”</p><p>--</p><p>
<strong>Agatha’s POV</strong>
</p><p>It was just past 2 a.m., and the golden lamplight threw long shadows over the cracked spine of leather-bound intelligence folder. The desk in front of Agatha Harkness was cluttered with classified documents, military projections, and a half-empty glass of untouched bourbon. But she hadn’t turned a page in nearly half an hour.</p><p>She wasn’t thinking about Sokovia.</p><p>She was thinking about Rio.</p><p>The thought of her haunted this room now. It had ever since that night. It had seeped into the silence between them, into the ache in her chest when Rio stood too close, into the curl of longing in her spine when she sat too long and remembered the weight of Rio’s hands on her hips.</p><p>The door opened with a soft click.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up. She didn’t need to.</p><p>She knew the way Rio moved. The way her boots softened against the carpet. The way her breath deepened when she saw Agatha like this – alone, exhausted, unraveling.</p><p>“You’re still awake,” Rio said. Her voice was quiet, but not soft. It carried heat, weight. Restraint.</p><p>“So are you,” Agatha replied, flipping a page just to make it look like she was doing something useful.</p><p>“You should sleep.”</p><p>Agatha snorted without humor. “And you should stop protecting me from ghosts.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. She stepped deeper into the room, the door shutting behind her with a finality that made the air feel heavier. Her presence was magnetic. It always had been, but now it felt dangerous.</p><p>Agatha looked up.</p><p>And for a breath, neither of them moved.</p><p>Rio stood by the fireplace, flame catching along the line of her jaw, throwing shadows down her throat. Her jacket had been discarded, her shirt sleeves rolled up her forearms, exposing the delicious muscle there. She looked like sin and salvation, standing there with eyes that knew too much.</p><p>“This is a bad idea.” Agatha murmured.</p><p>“Then tell me to leave.”</p><p>Agatha opened her mouth. But nothing came out.</p><p>Because she didn’t want Rio to leave.</p><p>She wanted Rio to stay. She wanted Rio to come closer. She wanted –</p><p>“I think about it every night.” She said, the words dragging out of her like blood from a wound.</p><p>Rio blinked; her face unreadable.</p><p>Agatha stool. She walked slowly around the desk, every step deliberates. When she reached the hearth, she stopped, just short of touching. Close enough to feel the heat of Rio’s body.</p><p>“I think about your hands on me.” Agatha said, voice low, confessional. “The way you took me apart. The sound you made when I moaned into your mouth. The way you made me forget who I was, as if I was only yours.”</p><p>Rio didn’t speak; her eyes fluttering closed as her jaw ticked.</p><p>“I think about what it would be like if I asked you to bend me over that desk. Not like before. Slower. Meaner. More certain.”</p><p>Rio’s throat bobbed with a hard swallow.</p><p>Agatha leaned slightly, her breath ghosting across Rio’s collar. “I think about the sound your belt would make as you unbuckled it. About you pressed me down against the seal of this office, using your body to hold me still.”</p><p>She looked up at her then, eyes wide and dark and ruined. “I think about you sliding into me with your strap. Fucking me until I can’t remember anything but your name.”</p><p>Rio’s hand flexed at her side.</p><p>Agatha wasn’t done</p><p>“I’d beg for it. Right there on the desk where I sign executive orders. Where I try to keep this world from burning. I’d beg for<em> you</em> to ruin me.”</p><p>And then her voice cracked.</p><p>“But I can’t. I can’t let that happened.”</p><p>Rio finally spoke. Her voice hoarse. “Why not?”</p><p>Agatha stepped back like she’d been scaled. Her arms crossed, her shoulders folding inward.</p><p>“Because you’re the head of my security detail. Because if anyone knew…” She shook her head. “It wouldn’t just be a scandal. It would be a disaster. They would crucify us both. They’d call it abuse of power. They’d say I seduced you. Or worse – that you manipulated me. It would tear apart the administration. And you… you would never wear that badge again.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, slow and pained. “I never cared about the badge.”</p><p>“Well, I do.” Agatha snapped. “I care about what you’ve built. About what it cost you to be where you are. Things do not come easily to women in this country.”</p><p>She turned; one hand braced on the edge of the desk. Her back was to Rio now. Her voice softened.</p><p>“Do you know how hard it is to sit here, day after day, and pretend I don’t want to break every rule for you?”</p><p>A beat.</p><p>“Do you know what it feels like to ache in silence? It would be different, if it was just sex, but you and I both know that isn’t true.”</p><p>Another beat. Then footsteps. Soft. Controlled.</p><p>Rio stood behind her again. Just close enough to feel. Not touching. Not yet.</p><p>“Yes,” Rio said.</p><p>Agatha breathed in sharply. Rio took another step, gently pressing her body against Agatha, and Agatha, God help her, leaned her body back into her. She brought a hand up to brush the loose curls from the side of Agatha’s neck, fingers trembling slightly. And then, slow and reverent, she lowered her mouth, ghosting her lips over the skin just beneath Agatha’s ear. Not a kiss. Not yet. Just heat. Just promise.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched. Her eyes fluttered closed, lips parting, but no sound came out. Just sensation.</p><p>Rio’s nose brushed the edge of her jaw, and for a moment she lingered – letting the silence speak, letting the ache curl tighter between them. Her hand hovered just above Agatha’s waist, shaking with restraint, with the memory of how it felt to hold her, to own every gasp she gave.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly, involuntarily, baring more of her throat to the ghost of that touch. It was an offering and a refusal all at once.</p><p>Rio didn’t press further. She couldn’t. Not here. Not like this.</p><p>But she let her breath fan across Agatha’s skin, warm and unspoken, and Agatha shivered like it was a touch. Like it was a promise they both knew could destroy them.</p><p>“Stay,” Agatha whispered. “But stay on that side of the room.”</p><p>“How long?” Rio murmured against her skin.</p><p>Agatha looked over her shoulder, eyes tired and burning.</p><p>Rio nodded once.</p><p>And took her post by the fire.</p><p>Agatha sat back down.</p><p>But her hand trembled as she picked up her pen. And the fire cast long shadows behind her, where Rio stood watching, burning with everything they couldn’t have.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>--</p><p>
<strong>Rio's POV</strong>
</p><p>It had been a week.</p><p>Seven days since Agatha’s voice had broken in the Oval Office and Rio had dared to press against her like a woman already lost.</p><p>Since then, nothing had happened. Not really. No more ghosted touches. No more whispered confessions or illicit proximity.</p><p>But something <em>had </em>changed. The air between them hummed differently now – thicker, electric, like a voltage line fraying in the dark. Every glance, every brush of awareness was steeped in knowledge of what had nearly happened, and worse, what they both still wanted.</p><p>Rio stood just inside the Roosevelt Room, arms behind her back, gaze fixed ahead but mind spiraling. She was supposed to be assessing the security flow for the upcoming state dinner, but her eyes kept drifting to the head of the table where Agatha sat between Jen and Secretary Calderu.</p><p>They were discussing decorum, floral arrangements, and diplomatic seating politics, but Rio barely heard a word.</p><p>Because Agatha looked lethal today.</p><p>Her hair was down in soft, deliberate waves touched by streaks of silver that framed her face like armor. A silk blouse clung to her shoulders in a deep shade of plum. She kept adjusting her glasses, and every time her fingers brushed the bridge of her nose, Rio felt like she was unraveling from the inside out.</p><p>She shouldn’t look. Shouldn’t think about it. But Agatha would lift her eyes – slow, almost lazy – and that look would be there again. Hunger, control, memory.</p><p>Like she wanted to devour Rio in silence.</p><p>“We’ll need to be careful with the Sokovian delegation,” Lilia was saying, tapping her pen against the seating chart. “Too close to Latvia and it becomes provocative. Too far, and it reads like a snub.”</p><p>“I’d recommend moving them one seat closer to Wakanda,” Agatha said, calm and sharp. “That sends a subtle message about expectations for neutrality, without sparking outright tension.”</p><p>“Risky,” Lilia replied, but nodded. “Bold. I like it.”</p><p>“And the Belgians?” Jen asked, flipping her binder open. “Still insisting on their ambassador being near the First Lady of France?”</p><p>“Apparently, he’s nursing a crush,” Lilia muttered.</p><p>Jen scoffed. “And what that means we shuffle protocol?”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes didn’t leave the seating chart. “It means we give him what he wants in exchange for a quiet concession later. Put him two seats to the right. Not close enough to leer, but close enough to feel acknowledged.”</p><p>Jen made a note. “You’re playing five-dimensional chess again.”</p><p>“I don’t play,” Agatha said, the corner of her mouth lifted, “I win.”</p><p>The heat that moved through Rio’s chest was involuntary.</p><p>“I am more worried about them trashing the wine list again,” Jen muttered, flipping through a printout. “Last time, one of them called our merlot ‘civilian piss’.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved. “It<em> was</em> civilian piss. I replaced the supplier the next morning.”</p><p>The sound of her voice – dry, knowing, laced with amusement – sent a bold of heat through Rio. She shifted her stance, jaw tight.</p><p>“I’ll coordinate with the sommelier,” Lilia said. “But if a single Sokovian sneezes near my centerpieces, I am flying back home.”</p><p>“You’re already home,” Jen deadpanned.</p><p>“Exactly.”</p><p>Agatha leaned back, hands clasped in front of her, and her eyes flicked to Rio.</p><p>Held.</p><p>Just a second too long.</p><p>A breath caught in Rio’s throat. Her pulse kicked.</p><p>She looked away – to the window, where a soft spring storm blurred the D.C. skyline.</p><p>Of course it was raining.</p><p>She remembered Agatha’s voice from that night. Remembered the husky tension when she said she’d imagined being taken again – slower, meaner. Right on the desk. And now, with diplomatic protocol being reviewed over finger sandwiches, all Rio could see was that polished wood and the stretch of Agatha’s body across it.</p><p>Or hers.</p><p>“Speaking of optics,” Agatha said, turning a page in her dossier,” let’s replace the long table set up. I want intimate rounds of eight. Four per side, alternating nationals and diplomats. It will encourage discussion and make it harder for one bloc to dominate the narrative.</p><p>Jen tapped her pen against her lips. “We’ll need more service staff for that. More earpieces too.”</p><p>Rio stepped forwards; voice steady. “I’ll expand the team. Quietly. The additional agents will blend in.”</p><p>Agatha’s eyes met hers, and Rio felt it.</p><p>The way Agatha’s gaze softened – just barely – then darkened again.</p><p>“Thank you,” Agatha said. Her voice held no tremor, but something curled underneath the surface.</p><p>Lilia didn’t notice. She was too busy scribbling floral notes. “No lilies. The Latvians associate them with funerals.”</p><p>“And no white roses.” Jen added, “France still hasn’t forgotten the last banquet when the Ambassador’s wife cried over the table.”</p><p>Agatha sighed. “What about Orchids?”</p><p>“Safe. Elegant. Expensive enough to look like we care,” Lilia said.</p><p>Rio watched Agatha nod. It was precise. Presidential. But the second her attention dropped back to the agenda, Rio caught the way her fingers lingered – slow, like she was imaging something else.</p><p>“Agent Vidal,” Agatha said suddenly, voice cool.</p><p>“Yes ma’am.”</p><p>“Please ensure the upper-level staff entrance is secured before the dinner. I don’t want reporters or unauthorized guests using it as a shortcut.”</p><p>“Understood.”</p><p>“And stay visible during the event.”</p><p>A pause.</p><p>“I want you where I can see you.”</p><p>Jen glanced up, curious. Lilia didn’t react.</p><p>But Rio felt like she had been lit on fire.</p><p>“Yes ma’am.” She said, eyes steady.</p><p>Agatha turned back to the floral mockups. Calm. Detached. But Rio knew better.</p><p>She could see it now in every movement – Agatha’s iron grip on her own composure.</p><p>And Rio could feel herself cracking in the quiet.</p>

<strong>Agatha’s POV</strong>
</p><p>Rio’s mouth crashed against hers like a wave breaking on rock – sharp, sudden, wet. It wasn’t sweet. It wasn’t tender.</p><p>It was desperate.</p><p>Agatha didn’t remember how they had got here, only that her back hit the Resolute Desk with enough force to scatter pens and briefing folders to the floor. Somewhere, someone would care.</p><p>Not her.</p><p>Not now.</p><p>She clawed at Rio’s shirt, fingers yanking the buttons apart with a hiss, raking her nails down taut muscles. “You think you’re in control?” She rasped against her lips, biting her bottom one so hard it started bleeding.</p><p>Rio growled in return, on hand coming up to grip Agatha’s throat before turning her head exposing her neck/ Her teeth grazed Agatha’s jaw before her other hand found the slit in her skirt dragging it up, exposing thigh, skin, heat.</p><p>“I’ve never been in control with you,” Rio said, voice rough and shaking.</p><p>“Then beg,” Agatha whispered.</p><p>She meant it to be cruel.</p><p>It came out like a prayer.</p><p>Rio dropped to her knees, strong hands sliding along her thighs as if mapping a sacred geography. Agatha’s head fell back when teeth grazed the inside of her knee, her breath catching in a gasp too loud for the West Wing.</p><p>Her hands were in Rio’s hair now, gripping tight as a whimper caught in her throat. “Don’t stop,” she said. Ordered. Pleaded. It didn’t matter.</p><p>Rio didn’t stop.</p><p>When her mouth found Agatha again, it was with the reverence of someone dying for absolution. The snap of her hips against the desk, the scrape of nails over the edge – Agatha bit down a cry, thighs threatening to suffocate Rio.</p><p>“Say my name,” Rio murmured, voice hot and ruined between her legs.</p><p>“God,” Agatha gasped. “<em>God</em> – Rio.”</p><p>“Again Agatha.”</p><p>“Rio,” She moaned, “Don’t stop…”</p><p>And then –</p><p>A sound.</p><p>Sharp. Distant. Real.</p><p>Agatha jerked upright in her bed, chest heaving, heart racing like gunfire in her ribs.</p><p>The bedroom was dark. Too dark.</p><p>No Rio.</p><p>No desk.</p><p>Just sweat-damp sheets and the ghost of pleasure still humming between her legs like an aftershock.</p><p>“Fuck,” She whispered, hard pressed to her sternum.</p><p>The storm outside rumbled low against her windows.</p><p>She was alone. Still alone.</p><p>And that was the worst part of the dream.</p><p>It had felt so <em>real.</em></p><p>So close.</p><p>Too close.</p><p>--</p><p>Agatha walked into the Situation Room like she belonged in the storm that was raging outside the White House.</p><p>Crisp navy suit, hair swept up in a smooth twist, expression carved in granite. If the dream from hours earlier still clung to her skin like smoke, no one would know it. Not from her step. Not from her face. Not from the calm deliberate way she took her seat at the head of the table.</p><p>The President didn’t tremble.</p><p>The President didn’t sweat.</p><p>The President <em>commanded.</em></p><p>“Madam President,” Secretary Calderu began without preamble, placing a folder on the table. “Sokovian movements at the Pinsk border overnight. Unmarked transports. No confirmed engagement, but local surveillance says its likely artillery repositioning.”</p><p>“Intent?” Agatha asked, flipping the folder open with steady fingers.</p><p>“They’re not posturing anymore,” Calderu replied. “They’re preparing. It looks like a shift from deterrence to readiness.”</p><p>“Satellite intel confirms uptick in encrypted communications with Belarus,” General Rogers added. “We’re seeing signature flags consistent with weapons transfer. Not fill mobilization. Not yet. But it’s enough to ring Brussels’ bells.”</p><p>Yelena Belova leaned back in her chair; boots crossed at the ankle under the table. “They’re doing this with a grin. It’s a slap dressed up like a handshake.”</p><p>“And our Embassy?” Agatha asked.</p><p>“Still operational,” Yelena answered. “But there is noise. Loud noise. Our consulate in Vienna intercepted chatter that Sokovian diplomats are planning to demand neutrality tomorrow at the dinner.”</p><p>Agatha closed the folder. “No.”</p><p>Yelena blinked. “No…?”</p><p>“There will be no Sokovian diplomats at the state dinner.”</p><p>A quiet ripple moved through the room.</p><p>“Ma’am, that will be viewed as…” Calderu started.</p><p>“A deliberate line in the sand,” Agatha cut in, voice clear, even. “Yes. That’s the point. Let them know they’ve lost their seat at the table – literally and figuratively – until they deescalate and withdraw their armored presence from the border.”</p><p>Steve gave a low nod of respect. “Understood.”</p><p>“And if Brussels panics,” Agatha continued, “we remind them Article Five is only as strong as its enforcers. We lead. We do not flinch.”</p><p>She took her pen, clicked it open, and signed the directive.</p><p>No flourish. No hesitation.</p><p>Calderu took the paper. “It’s done. I’ll notify them after we are done here.”</p><p>“Next.” Agatha said.</p><p>--</p><p>
<strong>Rio’s POV</strong>
</p><p>The hallway outside the Situation Room thrummed with controlled chaos – phone calls behind closed doors, aides darting like currents between departments, and the sharp – clicking footsteps of someone trying to stay ahead of history. The smell of strong coffee, rain damp work, and toner clung to the air.</p><p>Alice stood just off-center from the double doors, one ankle cross over the other, sipping lukewarm espresso from a black porcelain cup like it was champagne. Her posture was replaced, but her eyes missed nothing. Least of all the detail agent posted to her left.</p><p>“You know,” she said idly, “for someone trained to be invisible, you’re about as subtle as a bull in a Tiffany’s.”</p><p>Rio didn’t move. “I’m here to protect not be a shadow.”</p><p>Alice grinned. “Must be the magnetic personality. Or maybe I’m just waiting to see if you combust.”</p><p>“I’m fine.”</p><p>“Mm.” Alice sipped. “That’s what people say right before they implode spectacularly and take national security down with them.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed, but she didn’t bite.</p><p>Alice tilted her head, sharp eyes catching every tick. “Come on. You’ve been coiled tighter than a sniper for the last twenty-four hours. I’ve seen calmer bomb squads.”</p><p>“I’m not your concern.”</p><p>“You’re not. She is.”</p><p>Rio’s nostrils flared slightly.</p><p>Alice pressed, softer now. “She came in like nothing could touch her. And I watched her flip that meeting like a chessboard. But her knuckles were white the entire time she held that folder, and she didn’t blink for the first seven minutes. That’s not strategy. That’s strain.”</p><p>“She’s managing it.” Rio said carefully.</p><p>“Right,” Alice said taking another sip.</p><p>Rio didn’t reply as the Situation Room does open with a low hiss of hydraulics. The hallway snapped to attention.</p><p>Agatha strode out first, spine straight, expression unreadable – an elegant weapon cloaked in navy wool and high-gloss heels. Her presence made people slow down, shift posture, recalibrate. She didn’t need to speak to command a room. She <em>was </em>the room.</p><p>Beside her walked Jen, still flipping through a binder with annotated margins. “– and Gauthier’s probably going to have a coronary,” she was saying, a voice full of dry amusement. “Disinviting the Sokovian? That’s the kind of bold move that makes headlines and enemies. Which I guess you like.”</p><p>“They made themselves enemies,” Agatha replied smoothly. “I’m just done serving them dessert.”</p><p>Jen let out a low whistle. “Remind me never to cross you.”</p><p>They rounded the corner and walked directly into Rio and Alice’s line of sight. Agatha’s eyes barely flicked to them, but that one flick – half a second, if that – Rio felt it. The catch in her step. The narrowing of her gaze. Like an invisible thread pulled taut between them.</p><p>Alice pushed off the wall to fall in step behind them, tugging Rio along with a flick of her chin. The four of them moved like a unit forged in fire.</p><p>“Madam President,” Alice called, “I’d like to officially lodge a complaint. Your foreign policy is making it extremely difficult for me to keep track of which diplomats I’m supposed to seduce, placate, or legally intimidate.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t slow. “You can do all three. Just not in that order.”</p><p>“That’s flirting with abuse of power.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t slow. “No, that’s power used efficiently.”</p><p>Je barked a laugh. “God, I love it when you get tyrannical.”</p><p>Alice stage-whispered to Rio, “You hearing this? This is what seduction looks like in constitutional law.”</p><p>Rio didn’t answer. She was too focused on the way Agatha was sweeping through the halls. It was mesmerizing.</p><p>Jen looped her arms around the binder and exhaled. “You know Gauthier’s going to try and call you out on this. Publicly.”</p><p>“Let him,” Agatha said. “Every time someone panics about me setting a boundary, they prove why it needed to be drawn.”</p><p>“Cold,” Alice murmured.</p><p>“Calculated,” Agatha corrected.</p><p>They turned into a quieter corridor now, one line with portraits of past administrations and narrow windows misted by the rain. The pace slowed, just slightly. The press was elsewhere. The staffers had scattered. And here, in this quiet stretch of hallway, things felt… thinner. Softer. The air less weaponized.</p><p>Agatha’s shoulders dropped half an inch.</p><p>Rio clocked it immediately.</p><p>Alice’s voice dropped too, glancing between them. “You know if you need backup tonight, I’m great at awkward small talk and luring petty diplomats into saying things on camera.”</p><p>“You’re not cleared to operate as bait.” Rio muttered.</p><p>Alice beamed. “You do worry about me.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips quirked.</p><p>They reached the junction near the residence wing elevators. Jen peeled off, muttering something about needing to ‘go scream into a napkin’ before prepping press language. Alice lingered a moment longer, her gaze catching Agatha’s.</p><p>“You sure about this move?” she asked meaning more than just the disinvite.</p><p>Agatha didn’t hesitate. “Yes.”</p><p>Alice nodded, satisfied. “We will up security protocol.”</p><p>She disappeared with a nod to Rio, leaving the hallway empty except for the two of them.</p><p>Agatha turned to go. Rio stepped aside, as always.</p><p>But instead of walking forward, Agatha paused.</p><p>She looked at Rio – fully now. No passing glance. No flicker. Just looked.</p><p>Her eyes weren’t glass. Not this time. They were dark. Tired. And something else.</p><p>“I appreciate your discretion,” Agatha said quietly.</p><p>Rio inclined her head. “It’s my job.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze didn’t move. “It’s more than that. I know.”</p><p>A long silence fluttered.</p><p>Then:</p><p>“You aren’t sleeping.” Rio said, not a question.</p><p>Agatha’s lips parted; a breath caught.</p><p>And then she turned, walking away without another word.</p><p>But her hand brushed Rio’s as she passed.</p><p>--</p><p>Rio stood alone.</p><p>The hallway outside the Residence was quiet, polished, ceremonial. No chatter. No junior aides scrambling past. She’d cleared it herself.</p><p>It wasn’t standard, not strictly. But tonight wasn’t standard either.</p><p>Below them, the East Room buzzed – diplomats circling like sharks in silk and tuxedos, a string quartet rehearsing through the murmur of champagne being poured. Protocol was in full swing.</p><p>But this hallway held stillness.</p><p>And Rio was waiting.</p><p>Her suit was flawless: black, pressed, sharp at every drop. No tie – just an open collar, clean lines. Her hands rested behind her back, her posture military, unmoving.</p><p>But inside?</p><p>A storm.</p><p>She was too aware of the door behind her. Of whom stood beyond it. Of the way memory blurred with anticipation. She could feel the echo of the last time they were alone like fingerprints against her ribs.</p><p>She didn’t look at her watch.</p><p>She <em>felt </em>the second’s pass.</p><p>And then –</p><p>The doorknob turned.</p><p>And Rio’s lungs forgot what they were supposed to do.</p><p>Agatha stepped out like she was walking into a theatre of power. Every inch of her was polished diplomacy and deliberate control. The navy gown fit like it had been measured to her intentions – structured silk, high neckline, sleeveless, with a back cut low enough to be remembered without being remarked upon. The slit at her leg was precise, not provocative. Her heels clicked against the marble like punctuation.</p><p>She didn’t speak.</p><p>She just looked at Rio.</p><p>And Rio looked back.</p><p>They let their eyes drag – once. A quiet study. A long silence thick with memory. The subtle shift of breath. The flicker of a gaze that wandered lower, lingered just a second too long.</p><p>Agatha was the first to speak, but her tone was perfectly dry.</p><p>“Well,” she said. I see the Presidential Detail is committed to raising the national heart rate tonight.”</p><p>Rio didn’t smile.</p><p> Not exactly.</p><p>But her voice was low and steady. “It’s part of the job description.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitched. “You wear it well.”</p><p>Her eyes swept over Rio’s form – measured, thoughtful, a diplomat assessing a territory already visible but never quite conquered.</p><p>“Handsome.” She added, like an observation more than a compliment.</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed. “You look…” she exhaled softly, “… exactly like the kind of woman wars are started over.”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer. “Let’s not encourage the press.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curved, a small, tight thing. “Too late for that.”</p><p>Their eyes met – just long enough for the room to shrink.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head slightly. “Tell me, Agent… is this your professional posture? Or just what you do when you’re trying not to stare?”</p><p>Rio didn’t flinch. “If I am staring, I am doing my job.”</p><p>“Oh?” Agatha arched a brow. “Protective detail? Or reconnaissance.”</p><p>“Both,” Rio said. “You’re a high-value assets.”</p><p>Agatha made a soft, amused sound in the back of her throat. Her fingers reached up, brushing something invisible from Rio’s lapel – a touch with no real purpose. The gesture itself was harmless.</p><p>But the pause that followed wasn’t.</p><p>Her hand lingered, just a fraction too long.</p><p>“You hide it well,” She murmured.</p><p>Rio’s breath hitched barely, “Hide what?”</p><p>“That look in your eye. Like you already know how this ends.”</p><p>Rio held her gaze. “Maybe I do.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth curved again, but it didn’t quite reach her eyes. Something inside her flickered – sharp and soft all at once.</p><p>“This gown is a distraction,” she said, voice quiet now.</p><p>“I noticed.”</p><p>“So have you accounted for that in your security assessment?”</p><p>“I’m adjusting for variables,” Rio said, tone dry.</p><p>Agatha’s smile finally reached her eyes. “Of course you are.”</p><p>She stepped even closer. Not touching. But the space between them now felt… fragile.</p><p>Her eyes dropped – not quite to Rio’s chest. Not quite to her lips. But somewhere in between.</p><p>Then back up.</p><p>The air was thick.</p><p>And when Agatha spoke again, it wasn’t for teasing.</p><p>“I’m tired.” She said, very quietly, “Of pretending.”</p><p>Rio’s throat tightened. “I know.”</p><p>Agatha took a breath, careful. “Of acting like this isn’t real. Like I don’t walk into rooms wondering where you are. Like I didn’t spend the last week thinking about the way you say my name when you forget who I am.”</p><p>Rio looked at her then – not just at her, <em>into</em> her. “Agatha.” She choked out.</p><p>And all the composure, all the cool detachment she wore like body armor, flickered.</p><p>“I’m done pretending too,” she said, voice low. “I tried. I’ve stood behind you in silence, guarded you, swallowed everything I fell until I could barely breathe…”</p><p>“Rio…”</p><p>“I want this.” Rio said. “I want you. And I’m not sorry for it.”</p><p>The words landed between them like a gauntlet.</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak right away.</p><p>She looked at her hands. Her reflection in the narrow mirror inset into the hallway paneling. The slight tremor in her breath.</p><p>Then she looked back at Rio.</p><p>And nodded.</p><p>“Good,” she said softly. “Because I’m giving in.”</p><p>Rio blinked.</p><p>“The world be damned,” Agatha added, with a hint of defiance.</p><p>And it wasn’t dramatic.</p><p>It wasn’t loud.</p><p>It was the calm of a storm that had already decided where it was going to strike.</p><p>Agatha’s hand brushed Rio’s again – just a whisper of contact. Nothing that would be seen. Nothing that would be cited.</p><p>But it was enough.</p><p>“Escort me, Agent.”</p><p>Rio smiled, leading the way to the elevator and pressing the button, following Agatha in.</p><p>Their hands didn’t touch again - but the closeness hummed.</p><p>And as they moved toward the elevator – the ballroom waiting below, the world sharpening its cameras – neither of them looked away.</p><p>Not anymore.</p>

<strong>Agatha’s POV</strong>
</p><p>The East Room glittered like a photograph in a history book.</p><p>Chandeliers hummed above, the sound of strings folding into the air like a ribbon. Crystal clinked against China, the floral arrangements were aggressive in their perfection, and the weight of hundreds of gazes were pulled at the edges of Agatha Harkness’ spine.</p><p>She stood at the center of it all, a wine-dark smile painted on her lips, hand gently resting on the curve of a champagne flute she hadn’t touched.</p><p>Her gown clung precisely where it needed to. The slit allowed just enough movement to glide without sweeping. Every inch of her was polished, powerful, poised – and vibrating with the effort it too not to look behind her.</p><p>Not look at Rio.</p><p>Because she could feel that protective gaze following her.</p><p>Somewhere behind her, in her periphery, a shadow and flame at once. Her presence a magnetic pull along Agatha’s skin. And it was unbearable.</p><p>She had agreed to give in. The world be damned. But tonight, the world still watched.</p><p>“Madam President.” Lilia Calderu said in greeting, sidling up to her, her voice low and dry as good vermouth. “You’re bleeding tension.”</p><p>Agatha blinked. Tilted her head slightly toward her Secretary of State. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“You’re vibrating.”</p><p>“I’m poised.”</p><p>“You’re lying.”</p><p>Agatha smiled tightly, but her jaw ached. “Gauthier’s circling. He hasn’t approached yet.”</p><p>Lilia followed her gaze. “He will.”</p><p>“He thinks I made a mistake.”</p><p>“You drew a boundary.”</p><p>“Diplomats don’t like boundaries.”</p><p>“Especially not when they come from a woman in heels.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled slowly. It burned. “He’ll try to shame me publicly.”</p><p>“Then look bored when he does it,” Lilia said. “Like it’s a dress rehearsal for a farce you’re too powerful to attend.”</p><p>Jen Kale appeared from the crowd like a weapon in emerald satin, two wine glasses in one hand and a raised brow in the other.</p><p>“I brought you both options,” She said to Agatha, “Dry or dangerous.”</p><p>Agatha took the glass on the left. “Is there a third?”</p><p>“Not since you disinvited the Sokovians.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. “They would have used my table to stage a lie.”</p><p>Jen sipped. “Of course they would have. And being in the room when you said it? Chef’s kiss.”</p><p>“It was satisfying.” Lilia agreed.</p><p>“It was surgical.” Jen corrected.</p><p>Agatha almost smiled.</p><p>Then she saw him.</p><p>Ambassador Henri Gauthier.</p><p>French diplomat. Longtime NATO hawk. Arrogant in the way only seasoned bureaucrats and mediocre men could be.</p><p>He was already walking toward her.</p><p>Agatha stood still.</p><p>She didn’t adjust her gown. She didn’t need to. But she straightened her spine and lifted her chin half an inch. Her mouth found a neutral curve. Not a smile. Not yet.</p><p>Gauthier stopped just shy of touching distance.</p><p>“Madam President,” he said, his voice oozing charm and vinegar. “You look… formidable tonight.”</p><p>“Ambassador,” She replied cooly. “Enjoying the evening?”</p><p>“Trying to,” he said, “though it’s hard not to notice a few empty seats.”</p><p>Agatha raised a brow. “And yet you managed to find yours without an issue.”</p><p>He chuckled lightly. “A bold move, excluding the Sokovians.”</p><p>“A necessary one.”</p><p>“You ignited unease.”</p><p>Agatha sipped her wine. “Unease is preferable to appeasement.”</p><p>“You risk alienating partners.”</p><p>“No. I’m clarifying our position. I won’t let this administration be complicit in performative neutrality. It leads to the genocide of people.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t wait for her team to interject. She turned slightly; voice clipped but composed. “Representation was extended. Those chose outrage. That was their strategy, not ours.”</p><p>“Because they were insulted,” Gauthier said. “And now I have three prime ministers asking whether the U.S. intends to rupture the alliance over a table arrangement.”</p><p>Agatha turned to him. Her voice dropped in temperature.</p><p>“Henri, if a table is all it takes to fracture NATO, then the alliance was already cracked. I refuse to prop it up with etiquette and white linen.”</p><p>His expression darkened. “This isn’t theatre, Madam President.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha said, leaning forward. “This is power. And I won’t apologize for exercising it.”</p><p>Gauthier narrowed his eyes. “You’re being emotional.”</p><p>That was the wrong choice.</p><p>Agatha took a step closer, lowering her voice to something lethal.</p><p>She was close enough that her voice didn’t need to rise. “Let me be perfectly clear. I am not emotional. I am calculating. I weighed the optics, I considered the backlash, and I still made the call. Because doing what’s right is not always synonymous with doing what’s comfortable for men like you.”</p><p>He stiffened.</p><p>Agatha went on, tone calm as a scalpel. “The Sokovians have violated agreements, antagonized borders, and issued thinly veiled threat to half the room tonight. A group with ties to their security ministry tried on my motorcade last month – an act they have yet to disown, let alone condemn. They do not get my table. They do not get my wine. They do not get a photo op in front of an American flag while planning their next advance.”</p><p>Gauthier faltered. His mouth opened, then closed.</p><p>Agatha tilted her head. “Now unless you’d like to discuss actionable strategy to deter escalation, I suggest you return to your set and enjoy the duck confit.”</p><p>A beat of silence.</p><p>Then he bowed.</p><p>Not out of respect.</p><p>Out of retreat.</p><p>He walked away.</p><p>Within seconds, two more diplomats converged – Minister Dietrich from Germany and Foreign Secretary Halliday from the UK.</p><p>“Madam President,” Dietrich said gently, “Germany does not question your right to set the guest list – but we do hope this move signals strategic clarity, not isolation.”</p><p>Agatha turned to him without missing a beat. “Clarity is the point, minister. We will not feign amity with those preparing to destabilize sovereign borders.”</p><p>Halliday, sharper, stepped forward. “There are murmurs that Paris is now considering a separate summit.”</p><p>Agatha raised her glass. “Then let Paris murmur. We’ll lead.”</p><p>Dietrich gave a careful nod. “Berlin will back you, if it comes to that. But we urge caution.”</p><p>“I value your counsel,” Agatha said smoothly. “And your backbone.”</p><p>Before they could part, a third figure joined them – Lucian Valois, the Belgian foreign minister. Silver-haired, sharp-eyed, with the sort of effortless charm that didn’t need to try.</p><p>“Madam President.” He said bowing slightly. “Your speech was sharper than your heels tonight.”</p><p>Agatha gave him a look. “That’s a dangerous thing to say to a woman that heads the most powerful nation.”</p><p>“Ah,” he said smiling. “But I’ve always been partial to danger. Especially when it arrives draped in silk and diplomacy.”</p><p>Jen choked slightly on her wine.</p><p>Agatha lifted a brow. “Careful, Minister. I don’t have time for another incident requiring an apology letter.”</p><p>Lucien leaned in, mock conspiratorial. “Then allow me to offer a preemptive one – should I ever cross the line between respect and fascination.”</p><p>“Fascination is allowed,” Agatha replied. “Flattery, however, gets you seated by the ice sculpture.”</p><p>He grinned. “Then I’ll try to keep my admiration strategic.”</p><p>As he stepped away, Jen leaned over. “I think he just tried to seduce you diplomatically.”</p><p>“Let him try,” Agatha murmured. “I’m more dangerous in heels than he is with an army.”</p><p>Jen handed her the second glass. “You earned this one.”</p><p>Agatha took it. Drank.</p><p>“That was cleaner than I expected,” Lilia murmured.</p><p>“He knows he’s lost the room.” Agatha said.</p><p>--</p><p>
<strong>Rio’s POV</strong>
</p><p>Rio stood near the edge of the ballroom, perfectly still.</p><p>From here, her position had full coverage of the East Room – diplomats, aides, security staff. She could see the snaking path of waiters slipping between clutches of political royalty. The music was pleasant, too polished to be stirring. The champagne was probably overpriced. The tension in her jaw? Unrelenting.</p><p>Agatha had stepped onto the dance floor alone – shoulders back, head high. Regal. Self-possessed. Magnificent.</p><p>And then the Belgian foreign minister, Lucien Valois, extended his hand.</p><p>Rio’s eyes narrowed.</p><p>Agatha hesitated, just for a second, then accepted. Valois led her into a slow waltz, all diplomatic charm and calculated grace.</p><p>From across the room, Rio tracked every turn.</p><p>“You’re staring,” came Yelena’s voice from her left, low and amused.</p><p>“I’m working.” Rio replied without shifting her eyes.</p><p>“Sure,” Yelena said stepping beside her. “That must be why your shoulders are locked up like you’re preparing for a sniper shot.”</p><p>Rio gave a small grunt and adjusted the mic on her collar.</p><p>Yelena kept watching her. “You really don’t know how to turn it off, do you?”</p><p>“It’s not my job to relax,” Rio said.</p><p>“It’s a dance, Vidal. Not a coup.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth twitched – just slightly – but didn’t curve into a smile.</p><p>Yelena followed her gaze to the dance floor. “You think he is probing?”</p><p>“Of course he is probing,” Rio said tightly. “That man doesn’t ask a question unless he’s already two moves ahead.”</p><p>“You know,” Yelena said, folding her arms, “when I first got this appointment, I figured the Secret Service detail would be uptight. Strait-laced. But you’re like a wolf. Staring down every guest like you can smell intent.”</p><p>Rio didn’t respond.</p><p>Yelena let the silence sit a moment before adding, “I’d be lying if I said I didn’t find it a little hot.”</p><p>That drew Rio’s gaze – sharp, surprised.</p><p>Yelena just gave a crooked smile. “Don’t panic. I know better than to throw myself at someone who’s married to their job. You’ve got more walls up than Langley.”</p><p>“I’m not married to anything.” Rio said coolly.</p><p>“Mmmm. Just deeply committed.”</p><p>Alice appeared at their side like smoke. “Are this what flirting sounds like from the defense department?”</p><p>“Depends on whether she’s buying the next round.” Yelena said dryly.</p><p>“I’ll make it a double,” Alice replied smoothly. “Now back to business. Australian attaché confirmed – they’re voting against the Sokovian resolution. Said the President was ‘convincing’. I think that was diplomatic for ‘scary as hell’.”</p><p>Rio gave a short nod, eyes still on the floor. “She earned that.”</p><p>“She’s handling the room like it’s a pressure mine.” Yelena said, her tone shifting. “Even when she’s dancing, she’s scanning every angle.”</p><p>“She’s not missing a thing,” Rio agreed.</p><p>“Neither are you,” Alice added, eyes flickering sideways. “You’re more keyed up than usual.”</p><p>Rio’s jaw flexed. “Lot of chatter. Lot of moving parts.”</p><p>“Mmmm. Press pen’s getting antsy,” Alice said. “One of them just texted me: ‘Is Gauthier sweating?’ Apparently, that’s our new diplomatic weather gauge.”</p><p>“Let them speculate,” Rio said. “Gauthier’s folding, and the President hasn’t even blinked.”</p><p>“Neither have you.” Yelena murmured.</p><p>That silence hung heavy between them for a moment. On the floor, Agatha tilted her head – laughing politely at something Valois said. Rio’s eyes tracked it like it might detonate.</p><p>“She’s not enjoying it.” Alice observed.</p><p>“No,” Rio said.</p><p>“She’s using it,” Alice added. “Valois has something she wants.”</p><p>“He doesn’t know it yet,” Rio murmured.</p><p>Yelena tilted her head, watching Rio now. “You ever dance?”</p><p>Rio gave her a look.</p><p>Yelena held her hands up in mock defense. “Just curious. Seems like the only time you ever move is to reposition for coverage.”</p><p>“I move when I need to,” Rio said.</p><p>Alice grinned. “She dances with bullets, not diplomats.”</p><p>Rio didn’t smile, but her posture relaxed just a fraction.</p><p>Yelena’s voice dropped, quieter now. “You do good work, Vidal. But maybe tonight, let someone else carry the weight of worry for five minutes.”</p><p>Rio shook her head. “I don’t let things fall through.”</p><p>Alice sighed. “God forbid.”</p><p>Another agent’s voice crackled softly in Rio’s earpiece. “Chatter in the press pen just ticked up again. French envoy’s facial expression might go viral.”</p><p>“Let it.” Rio said. “Tonight isn’t for saving face. It’s for drawing lines.”</p><p>From across the room, Agatha turned slightly – her eyes sweeping the space with ease. They passed over Rio’s position.</p><p>And then, just for a second the stopped.</p><p>Not long. Not intense. But a pause. A recognition.</p><p>Rio didn’t move.</p><p>Neither did Agatha.</p><p>Then she continued dancing – composure unbroken.</p><p>Yelena noticed. “Looks like she saw you.”</p><p>Rio’s reply was quiet. “She sees everything.”</p><p>--</p><p>
<strong>Agatha’s POV</strong>
</p><p>Agatha let Valois take her hand.</p><p>His palm was too warm. His ring finger callused where it shouldn’t be. The man was polished yes – but polished like a blade, not a gem.</p><p>The orchestra swept into a stately waltz. Around them, diplomats danced and drank and plotted behind polite smiles. She followed him into step without faltering, her expression unreadable, her body poised like a dagger in velvet.</p><p>“Ah, Madame President,” Valois said, smiling as though he already owned the moment. “America’s iron queen. I’ve been warned about you.”</p><p>“Then they didn’t warn you enough,” She murmured.</p><p>He laughed, amused and unthreatened. “You wear power beautifully.”</p><p>“You say that like you think I’m wearing it for you.”</p><p>His grip tightened just slightly. “Do you always come out swinging in ballrooms?”</p><p>“Only when I am bored.”</p><p>“I’d hoped to charm you.”</p><p>She tilted her head. “That is a common mistake.”</p><p>Valois’s smile didn’t falter, but his eyes grew sharper. “Tell me then. What would it take to intrigue you?”</p><p>“Something honest,” She said, “something rare.”</p><p>“Then let’s talk honestly,” he said, voice dripping in octave. “Sokovia. If the vote fails…”</p><p>“It won’t.”</p><p>But if it does...”</p><p>“It won’t.”</p><p>His smile faded, just slightly. “You’re certain.”</p><p>“I’m inevitable.”</p><p>Valois chuckled again, but the edge of his gaze had shifted. “Your confidence borders on delusion.”</p><p>“No.” she said cooly. “It borders on intel. Which I have. And you don’t.”</p><p>“You act like the world belongs to you.” He spoke.</p><p>Agatha’s eyes glittered. “No. I act like I am done asking for a seat at the table I built.”</p><p>They tuned – one slow revolution in the sweep of the dance, her heel slicing the marble with precision. And then his hand drifted a millimeter too far, the shift in his stance familiar, entitled.</p><p>Her voice cut through low and lethal, “I’m simply tired,” she paused leaning forward, “of men who mistake proximity for permission.”</p><p>Valois froze for half a beat. She felt it – the tension coiling in his spine as if stuck.</p><p>“Touché.” He said, tone clipped.</p><p>A beat of silence passed. Then:</p><p>“I’ll be frank,” Valois said, shifting tactics. “We’re nervous. Gauthier’s holding by a thread, and the Europeans are split. Sokovia is a powder keg, and you’ve lit the match. What are you after?”</p><p>She leaned in just enough to let her breath ghost near his jaw. Not intimate. Predatory.</p><p>“Stability,” she said.</p><p>“And the cost?”</p><p>“Depends on who pays it.”</p><p>He stared at her, dark eyes searching. “You’ll make enemies you can’t unmake.”</p><p>She smiled again. “You should hope I’ve already made them. That’s the only reason you’re still on this dance floor.”</p><p>Another slow turn. Her eyes skimmed the room – flashes of glittering glass, watchful reporters, aides pretending not to eavesdrop.</p><p>And then –</p><p>There.</p><p>Rio.</p><p>Stone-still at the edge of the crowd, half-shadowed by a column, black suit like a second skin. The tension in her jaw visible even from here. Agatha’s gaze caught hers – <em>and found her already staring.</em></p><p>The moment struck like a blow to the chest.</p><p>Everything inside Agatha stilled.</p><p>Rio’s eyes didn’t waver. Didn’t blink. Didn’t move. They just <em>held her</em> – with the kind of focus and respect that made the rest of the world drop away.</p><p>Agatha didn’t look away.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Not until the silence between them screamed louder than the movement.</p><p>Then she exhaled slowly and turned her attention back to Valois.</p><p>He’d seen it.</p><p>Of course he had.</p><p>His expression shifted, calculating. “She’s intense that one.”</p><p>“Careful,” Agatha said, voice suddenly glacial. “You’re one comment away from becoming a security incident.”</p><p>Valois raised both hands slightly in mock surrender, lips twisting. “You dive hard, Agatha.”</p><p>“And you drive drunk on relevance. We all have our vices.” Another step Another breath.</p><p>She could still <em>feel</em> Rio’s eyes on her. Not touching – but <em>branding.</em> A line of heat down her back, across the top of her chest. She could almost taste her – steel and ash and restraint wound so tight it might snap.</p><p>Valois leaned in one last time. “Just answer me this. When it breaks – because it <em>will </em>break – are you going to be the one left standing in the rubble?”</p><p>Agatha met his eyes with a calm fury.</p><p>“I’m not standing in the rubble, Lucien,” she said. “I am the one who decides where it falls.”</p><p>The music ended.</p><p>She stepped back.</p><p>He bowed. She didn’t her eyes swept across the crowd again, but this time she didn’t look for Rio. She didn’t need too.</p><p>--</p><p>
<strong>Rio’s POV</strong>
</p><p>The orchestra’s final chord lingered like the ghost of a command. The East Room murmured with soft sounds of diplomacy disassembling – diplomats making their polite exits, aides collecting empty glasses, a thousand cameras finally blinking to rest. Agatha stood still, statuesque at the edge of the crowd. Her heels had not moved in minutes.</p><p>Rio was there the moment Agatha turned.</p><p>No words. No signal. Just instinct.</p><p>They peeled off silently, Alice catching Rio’s eyes briefly – <em>You’re clear</em>. Agatha didn’t offer goodbyes or thanks, only the precision of her movements and the cut of her profile as she strode toward the East Wing exit. Every step was power. Every inch between them vibrated with something unraveled.</p><p>The service corridors behind the dining room were empty, dimmer, laced with security light. Marble turned to polished concrete. Velvet became silence.</p><p>Rio followed like gravity had selected her for it.</p><p>They reached the elevator.</p><p>The doors slid open.</p><p>They stepped inside.</p><p>Rio hit the button for the Residence.</p><p>As the doors closed, something snapped.</p><p>Agatha didn’t speak – but she didn’t need too.</p><p>Her back was still turned when Rio moved.</p><p>Two strides. One breath.</p><p>Then Rio caught her wrist – firm but not rough – and turned her sharply. Not violently. Not disrespectfully. But like the world had been asking her not to for far too long.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth parted, a protest or a gasp –</p><p>Then she was pressed against the mirrored wall.</p><p>Rio’s body flush against hers. The mirrored panel in front of her fogged with her breath.</p><p>“I’ve waited all night,” Rio said, voice low, ragged, almost dangerous, “watching you wield power like a blade, watching you let that fucking diplomat put his hands on you 0 and you let him, Agatha...”</p><p>“It was strategy,” Agatha hissed, breath hot, hands gripping at the railing in front of her.</p><p>“It was torture.” Rio growled.</p><p>Agatha’s head tilted, defiant. “So, what are you going to do about it?”</p><p>Rio’s hand slid around her throat – not squeezing, just anchoring.</p><p>“Look at yourself,” she said. Her other hand caught Agatha’s chin, turned it to make her look at herself in the mirror.</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched.</p><p>In the reflection: the President of the United States pinned like a secret, eyes gone dark, mouth parted. Her dress was already wrinkled where Rio’s hand had found her hip. Her mascara was flawless. Her hunger was not.</p><p>“You’re perfect,” Rio rasped, her voice like a match strike.</p><p>“You walked into a room and bend the world. But in here…” her fingers flexed against the silk of Agatha’s gown – “you’re mine.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, uneven.</p><p>“And if I’m not?”</p><p>Rio leaned in, lips brushing her ear. “Then tell me to stop.”</p><p>She didn’t.</p><p>Instead, Agatha pushed off the mirror spinning herself to fully face Rio before fisting her hands in the lapel of her jacket. She dragged their mouths together in a clash of wine and fire.</p><p>It wasn’t soft. It wasn’t sweet.</p><p>It was everything they hadn’t said.</p><p>Teeth. Tongue. Heat.</p><p>Rio kissed her like she was claiming territory already marked, both dangerously close to forgetting titles and consequences. Agatha’s hands found her collar, then her hair, yanking until Rio groaned into her mouth.</p><p>The elevator kept climbing.</p><p>So did they.</p><p>Rio’s thigh slipped between Agatha’s legs. Her dress bunched indecently high. Agatha ground down hard, and Rio nearly lost her composure.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio whispered against her skin. “Do you even know what you do to me?”</p><p>Agatha’s voice was silk over a blade. “Yes. I know.”</p><p>“Say my name.”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Agatha…”</p><p>“No,” she hissed grabbing Rio’s jaw, forcing her to meet the reflection again. “Look. Look what you do to me.”</p><p>The mirror didn’t lie.</p><p>Agatha’s cheeks were flushed, lips red and kiss swollen. Her gown was half-undone at the shoulder, one strap nearly fallen, her leg wrapped around Rio’s hip like a vice.</p><p>And Rio – Rio was undone in a different way. Still in uniform. Still lethal. But wrecked. Like she would walk on her hands and knees through fire for the woman underneath her.</p><p>Agatha slid her hand down, over Rio’s chest, slow and dragging.</p><p>“I’m not giving you easy,” she murmured. “You want this, you fight for it.”</p><p>Rio did.</p><p>Mouth trailing down her neck, tongue hot against the pulse, she gripped Agatha’s thigh and pinned her harder against the mirrored wall. Agatha’s moan was sharp, obscene.</p><p>“You’re soaked,” Rio rasped. “And we haven’t even made it to the bed.”</p><p>Agatha smirked, though it was shaky. “You want to lecture me about control while I’m ready to come on your thigh?”</p><p>Rio groaned, “You’ll be the death of me.”</p><p>Their lips collided again. Agatha bit. Rio gasped. Her thigh pressed higher, grinding slow, deliberate. Agatha clutched at her shoulders like she’d fall apart without something to hold.</p><p>“You make me…” Agatha didn’t finish. Couldn’t.</p><p>Didn’t need to.</p><p>The elevator dinged.</p><p>They froze. Heavy breathing. Wrinkled silk. Hunger unfulfilled.</p><p>Doors opened.</p><p>Rio stepped back first, chest heaving, shirt ripped open and pants askew.</p><p>Agatha’s dress was twisted. Her lipstick was wrecked. Her dignity was intact – but only barely.</p><p>She didn’t fix a thing. She didn’t need too.</p><p>No one stood posted in the hall, just Rio and her making their way calmly to the Residence entrance.</p><p>Agatha turned once she was inside, facing Rio.</p><p>No hesitation. No coy retreat. Just the pure, calculated hunger of a woman done pretending she didn’t want what was hers to take. Her eyes, midnight dark and heavy-lidded, locked onto Rio like she was hunting her. She moved – slow and deliberate – and grabbed Rio by the tie. Yanked her forward. The move wasn’t elegant. It was commanding.</p><p>The kiss was war.</p><p>Agatha’s mouth crashed into hers, not searching but claiming, all tongue and teeth and the wet, obscene sound of months of denial breaking in real time. Rio groaned – full-bodied and involuntary – one had catching Agatha’s waist like she’d fall without it.</p><p>And God, her waist.</p><p>Rio’s fingers pressed into the curve where silk met flesh, gripping hard enough to leave marks. Agatha’s hips were pure temptation – full, soft, sinful – and Rio’s body was all taut muscle and trained control, trembled as that curve ground against her. It was beautiful, unbearable: Agatha’s thigh brushing the apex of Rio’s thighs, finding the heat already pooling there, pressing with purpose.</p><p>“Fuck,” Rio hissed against her lips.</p><p>Agatha smiled, savage. “You’re so wet for me already?” Mocking Rio’s earlier words.</p><p>“You had me soaked since you stepped out of those very doors.” Rio growled, lifting her, “And since the first time we did this, in this very room.”</p><p>Agatha gasped, legs wrapping around her instinctively as Rio carried her backwards towards the bed, her strength effortless and obscene. Shoulders like carved stone shifted under Agatha’s grasp, each movement of Rio’s body a reminder that she could break men with her hands – and here she was, carefully dismantling her instead.</p><p>They hit the mattress hard. Rio landed on top, hips slotted perfectly between Agatha’s thighs, mouth never parting.</p><p>Agatha’s hands went to the buttons of Rio’s shirt, impatient, popping them open to reveal the taut planes of her chest. Her skin was olive-gold, flushed with heat, and the cut of her muscles made Agatha ache. She leaned up, lips trailing down the line of her throat to her collarbone, licking the sweat already gathering there.</p><p>“You’re a fucking sculpture,” she breathed, tongue tracing the swell of Rio’s chest. “So handsome. No wonder they all want you.”</p><p>“They don’t get me.” Rio’s hand cupped her breast through the dress, thumb flicking her nipple through the silk. “Only you do.”</p><p>The sound Agatha made was animal.</p><p>She pushed Rio up, flipping them fast. Agatha straddled her now, dress hiked up over her hips, thighs hugging Rio’s ribs. Her own body was a vision – breasts full and high, the neckline of the gown dipping scandalously low, her skin pale and flushed, dusted with goosebumps. Her lipstick was ruined. Her perfectly grey streaked hair was chaos.</p><p>She looked like sin.</p><p>Rio’s hands spanned her hips, fingers digging into the softness there with reverence. “You’re divine.”</p><p>Agatha rocked against her. “I’m hungry.”</p><p>Rio surged up to meet her mouth, kissing her hard as one hand slid down to push the dress higher. She found the edge of her panties – already soaked – and tore them off without hesitation.</p><p>“Jesus,” she whispered, running her fingers through the slick heat between Agatha’s thighs. “I will never get used to you dripping for me.”</p><p>Agatha ground down against her hand, shuddering. “Not tonight. I get to feast first.”</p><p>She slid down Rio’s body like she’d been born to do it, pushing her shirt further open, pressing kisses to every inch of hard-earned muscle until she was between her thighs. She pulled the tailored trousers and briefs down, revealing everything Rio had hidden under her armor.</p><p>Rio gasped as Agatha licked a long strip up her center – slow, savoring, claiming.</p><p>“Agatha… fuck…”</p><p>“You taste like something holy,” Agatha whispered, before diving back in. She flattened out her tongue, circled her clit, teased her with entrance slow, wet strokes that had Rio’s thighs shaking in minutes. Her hands held Rio’s hips down as she licked like she was starving, relentless, ruthless.</p><p>Rio bucked. “I can’t – please – I’m going too…”</p><p>Agatha sucked hard, then moaned as Rio shattered. Her body arched, hands tangled in the sheets, a cry tearing from her throat like confession. She came on Agatha’s tongue, trembling, gasping, undone.</p><p>Agatha crawled back up, lips glistening. “Now,” she said darkly, “I want you inside me.”</p><p>Rio blinked, still panting, “What?”</p><p>Agatha reached beneath the bed, pulled out the harness, and shoved it into Rio’s hands.</p><p>“Put it on.” She demanded, “Now.”</p><p>Something primal sparked in Rio’s eyes. She obeyed, quick despite the aftershocks still rolling through her. Leather kissed her hips. The length jutted proud and ready.</p><p>Agatha climbed back onto her lap, position herself with one hand, and sank down in one unbroken motion.</p><p>Both moaned.</p><p>That might have been the hottest thing Rio had ever seen.</p><p>The stretch was maddening, perfect. Agatha’s eyes fluttered, lips parted, head tipped back in near-painful bliss.</p><p>“Fuck – you fill me so good.” She panted.</p><p>Rio gripped her hips, thrusting up to meet her, building the rhythm faster. The room blurred – just bodies, breath, the slap of skin.</p><p>It was violent in its intensity. Not cruel – never cruel – but desperate, all hips and friction and months of starvation finally fed. Rio drove into her with bruising precision, each stroke slamming the bed into the wall. Agatha raked her nails down Rio’s muscled chest, squeezing her breasts.</p><p>Agatha rode her like it was war, hands braced, hair flying, moans turned into cries. Her thighs trembled with effort, with pleasure.</p><p>“More,” she demanded. “Harder.”</p><p>Rio flipped them, taking over. “You want harder?” she growled, bracing herself and slamming in deep. “You’re going to take everything I give you.”</p><p>Agatha arched beneath her, crying out, hands clawing at Rio’s back. “Yes, fuck, like that – don’t – stop…”</p><p>“I’m not stopping until you forget your own name.”</p><p>Agatha’s laugh broke into another moan. “Then ruin me, Rio.”</p><p>The name hitting Rio like lightening. Her next thrust made the headboard crack the wall.</p><p>Agatha came with a scream, body locking tight, and Rio followed seconds later, burying her face in Agatha’s neck, both shaking.</p><p>When the world settled, Agatha cupped Rio’s jaw, pulling her in for a ling slow kiss.</p><p>“I should have demanded this months ago.” She whispered.</p><p>Rio grinned. “Yeah. I have been waiting to give in.”</p><p>Rio pulled out gently, removing everything to clean later.</p><p>They collapsed together, soaked and stunned.</p><p>Agatha reached out for her.</p><p>Rio pulled the older woman close.</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Then:</p><p>“You’re mine.” Agatha whispered, still breathless.</p><p>“Always.” Rio said.</p><p>And this time, there was no lie in it.</p>

<p>The room smelled like rain and skin.</p><p>Soft light crept through the gauzy curtains, coloring the world hues of early morning silver. Outside, the city slept. Inside, Agatha Harkness watched as the only person who had ever made her feel unarmored reached for her shirt.</p><p>Rio sat on the edge of the bed, bare from the waist up, the strong lines of her back drawn in delicate shadow. Angry red lines showed in the moonlight, one of the many claims Agatha had put on her.</p><p>Rio moved slowly as if each gesture cost her something. The open collar of her shirt brushed her shoulder as she pulled it on, and Agatha reached out before she could stop herself.</p><p>“Don’t go,” she said softly, fingertips just grazing the small of Rio’s back.</p><p>Rio froze. Her head tilted slightly; eyes fixed on the floor. Then she exhaled.</p><p>“I have too.”</p><p>Agatha sat up, the sheet falling to her waist. Her hair was loose, unruly, and her voice was rough with sleep and something else – something far more fragile.</p><p>“I know,” she said. “I just hate it.”</p><p>Rio turned to face her finally, and the pain in her eyes was raw, open, unhidden for once. There was no armor in her expression. No uniform in the world that could mask what lived in her now.</p><p>“I love you,” Rio said, her face showing it as her eyes tracked Agatha. As if it had been on her tongue for months, just waiting for a safe place to land.</p><p>Agatha blinked.</p><p>The words didn’t knock the air from her lungs the way she thought they might. They didn’t feel foreign or frightening. They felt inevitable.</p><p>Her mouth curved, trembling at the edges. “Of course you do,” she whispered, the ache turning to something warm.</p><p>Rio stepped forward then, kneeling before her at the edge of the bed, her hands finding Agatha’s hip beneath the sheets.</p><p>“I tried to stay above it,” she murmured, forehead pressing gently to Agatha’s thigh.</p><p>“Tried to tell myself it was just protection. That it was duty. But it’s not. I would follow you off the edge of the world if you asked. And not because it’s my job – but because it’s you.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers slid into Rio’s hair, cradling the back of her neck.</p><p>“You think I don’t feel the same?” She asked, voice low and rough. “Rio, I’ve wanted you since the first day you looked at me like I was more than my position.”</p><p>“You are.”</p><p>Agatha smiled down at her. “So are you.”</p><p>They stayed like that for a long moment. Breathing the same quiet. Holding the same truth.</p><p>Finally, Rio pulled back, rising to her feet, buttoning the last few buttons of her short. “I can’t stay in this job. Not now. Not like this.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t flinch. “I know.”</p><p>“I want to build something with you. Something Real. But I can’t do that while I’m part of your security detail. We both know the optics. The power dynamic. The risk.”</p><p>Agatha rose from the bed, leaving the sheets on the bed, bare shoulders kissed by the light. “You’re not leaving me, are you?”</p><p>Rio shook her head instantly. “Never. Just the chain of command.”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer and rested her forehead against Rio’s. “Then do it. Put in the transfer. Find a role where you are free.”</p><p>“I was thinking The Agency. QRT maybe.” Rio said gently, studying her reaction. “High risk, I know. But it’s real work. Something I am good at. Off the radar.”</p><p>“You sure about that?”</p><p>“No.” Rio admitted, a small smile tugging at her lips. “But I am sure about you.”</p><p>Agatha kissed her then. Slow. Deep. No heat this time. Just home.</p><p>When they parted, Agatha said, “I love you too. It’s not convenient. And it might not be safe. But it’s mine. You’re mine. I love you Rio Vidal.”</p><p>Rio exhaled, eyes closing for just a second. “I needed to hear that.”</p><p>“You’ll hear it again,” Agatha promised, brushing her knuckles along Rio’s jaw. “And again. And again. Until you believe it.”</p><p>Rio leaned in; one last kiss pressed to Agatha’s temple. “Get some sleep.”</p><p>Agatha smiled. “I’ll pretend to try.”</p><p>Rio left quietly her footsteps soft but unshakable. The doors closed behind her.</p><p>And for once, Agatha didn’t feel abandoned.</p><p>She felt chosen.</p><p>--</p><p>The Oval Office, four hours later.</p><p>The sun had fully risen, cutting across the historic curves of the room. Agatha sat behind the Resolute desk, a black mug of bitter coffee cooling beside her, eyes scanning the pages of the Sokovian brief that had been waiting when she returned from the Residence.</p><p>Her body was present. Her mind – still back in the shadows of dawn.</p><p>She turned a page. Marked a line. Underlined a veiled threat tucked inside an economic concession. It was sharp work, methodical. But her pen paused every few lines. Her thoughts drifted to the memory of Rio’s hand against her cheek. The way she’d whispered “I love you” like it had always been true. Because it had been.</p><p>She was focused on not thinking about it that she didn’t notice the door open.</p><p>“You look like hell,” Rio said casually.</p><p>Agatha’s head snapped up.</p><p>Rio leaned against the doorframe in her black suit, tie slightly loose, hands in her pockets, radiating a confidence that felt like fire kept barely caged. Agatha straightened slightly lifting her chin.</p><p>“You’re not supposed to walk in her unannounced.”</p><p>“Then fire me.”</p><p>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Not even slightly funny.”</p><p>Rio stepped in and shut the door with a soft click. “I filed the transfer,” she said voice gentler now. “CIA. QRT unit. Alice is already pulling strings. Shouldn’t be long.”</p><p>Something in Agatha eased. But not all the way.</p><p>“And until then?”</p><p>“Until then, I’m still yours. Professionally. Mostly.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Mostly?”</p><p>Rio smirked and moved toward the desk, her posture casual but alert, always aware of exits, of windows, of threat vectors. But her eyes – they were soft. Warm.</p><p>“Yelena’s still got a crush on me, by the way.” She said, plucking a classified document off the desk and flipping it without reading. “Told me I had the shoulders of a Roman general.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t look up from the brief she was pretending to still focus on. “She’s not wrong.”</p><p>“Jealous?”</p><p>“Should I be?”</p><p>Rio leaned forward on the desk, one hand bracing her weight as she whispered, “I am all yours baby.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips curled slightly. “Damn right you are.”</p><p>“She even asked if I wanted to blow off the morning brief and hit the shooting range. I told her I had plans.”</p><p>“Plans lie sneaking into the Oval to flirt with your boss?”</p><p>“Exactly like that,” Rio murmured, voice dipping low as she leaned in closer. “Told her I already had everything I wanted. Still feeling it this morning.”</p><p>Agatha chuckled, lips curling over the rim of her coffee. “Is that your subtle way of bragging? Because sweetheart, if I remember last night, there was nothing subtle about you.”</p><p>“Comes with the training.”</p><p>The moment hovered between them, warm and charged and familiar in a way that felt dangerous. And then –</p><p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” Jen’s voice exploded across the room like a grenade.</p><p>They both turned. The door hadn’t been locked. Jennifer Kale stood just inside the room, arms crossed, her heels clicking sharp across the floor as she advanced like a weapon in motion. Her eyes were ablaze.</p><p>“Unbelievable.” She snapped, “Tell me I’m not seeing what I’m seeing. The President of the United States practically making heart eyes at her detail way to close – who, unless I’m mistaken, has very visible marks on her neck.”</p><p>Agatha set her mug down with a quiet clink. “Jen…”</p><p>“Don’t you dare.” Jen cut her off. “Do you have any idea what you’ve risked? What this looks like? You’re the first female President. You do not get to be careless.”</p><p>Rio stepped back slightly but didn’t retreat. Her voice was calm. “I’ve already filed for transfer. CIA. QRT.”</p><p>Jen froze. “You what?”</p><p>Agatha stood now, spine tall, voice steady. “She’s stepping down from my detail. It’s already in motion.”</p><p>“To protect her,” Rio added, voice low but clear. “To protect this.”</p><p>Jen looked between them, stunned for a moment. Her anger softened just enough to let the panic show. “You know what kind of storm this would cause if it got out? Headlines. Hearings. Leaks. You’ll be crucified – not because you did anything wrong, but because they want you to fail.”</p><p>Agatha nodded slowly. “I know.”</p><p>“And I am walking away from the detail to make sure she can,” Rio said.</p><p>Jen’s mouth was tight. “I knew something was going on. I told myself I was imaging it because you are smarter than this.”</p><p>“I am,” Agatha said, “But I am not ashamed.”</p><p>“You don’t get to be human like them,” Jen said, voice breaking just slightly. “You have to be better. Cleaner. Untouchable. Because the world doesn’t want you to succeed.”</p><p>“Then maybe it’s time the world adjusts,” Agatha replied.</p><p>Jen stared for another long beat, then finally shook her head. “God help you if it leaks. Just – be smart. Both of you. Promise me that.”</p><p>Agatha held her gaze. “Always.”</p><p>Jen exhaled, weary now. She turned and left without another word.</p><p>The door clicked shut behind her.</p><p>Agatha let out a breath she hadn’t realized she had been holding.</p><p>Rio spoke breaking the silence. “That was… warmer than I expected.”</p><p>“Which part?”</p><p>“The part where she didn’t call for my immediate resignation. Or the part where she said she knew.”</p><p>Agatha looked at her, fierce and fragile all at once. “Both.”</p><p>Rio moved closer.</p><p>“You really mean it?”</p><p>Agatha nodded. “I always mean it when it comes to you.”</p><p>Rio pressed her forehead to Agatha’s.</p><p>They stood like that for a long time, not speaking, just holding still. A clock ticked softly behind them, but neither one moved. Outside, the sounds of the waking world filtered in slowly – a helicopter overhead, the distant rhythm of people beyond Lafayette Square, the shift of security at the West Wing door. None of it mattered.</p><p>Finally, Agatha broke the silence. “This isn’t over. Not with Jen. Not with the press. Not with the party.”</p><p>Rio didn’t pull back. “I know.”</p><p>“But I want you beside me anyway.”</p><p>Rio kissed her brow. “Then that’s where I’ll stay.”</p><p>And just like that, the fear settled. Not gone, not fixed. But face. Together.</p><p>--</p><p>
<strong>Two Weeks Later</strong>
</p><p>The fire in the hearth had died down to embers, casting a soft orange flicker over the shelves of books and polished bourbon decanters lining the private study. A storm rolled quietly beyond the windows, the wind tugging at the panes like a restless guest. It was nearly midnight. And Agatha Harkness had no interest in sleep.</p><p>She sat curled on a leather seat, barefoot, her navy slacks loose and comfortable, her white blouse open at the collar. Her laptop was open but forgotten on the coffee table in front of her, a report on rising cyber espionage threats barely scrolled past the second paragraph. Her glass of whiskey says untouched.</p><p>Because Rio was here.</p><p>It was the first time they’d been alone since the State Dinner.</p><p>Two weeks of silent corridors, careful spacing, and stolen glances across the rooms they no longer shared. Two weeks of aching restraint, every moment together watched, measured, profession. They had to keep it clean – technically. But tonight, finally, the air between them was allowed to breath.</p><p>Standing just across the room, dressed in a soft black t-shirt and fitted slacks, Rio was somehow still the most alert thing in the space. Her hair was damp from the rain, her holster gone but the echo of discipline still stamped across her posture. Her presence was steady, grounding.</p><p>And impossibly tempting.</p><p>“I got the call,” Rio said, and it took Agatha a second to realize what she said.</p><p>Agatha blinked. “From Langley?”</p><p>Rio nodded once, a quiet smile tugging at the corner of her mouth. “I’m in. Official assignment lands in the morning. It’s not QRT – more like black support. Embedded asset operations. Short-term, surgical deployments.”</p><p>Agatha exhaled, the breath catching Someshwar between relief and dread. “That sounds… incredibly dangerous.”</p><p>“Which is why I’m perfect for it,” Rio said, matter of fact. Then softer, “And it gets me out from under your detail. Which makes all this a hell of a lot less scandalous.”</p><p>Agatha tilted her head, her voice playful. “You think we’re any less scandalous now?”</p><p>Rio’s mouth curved into a smirk, but she didn’t answer. Instead, she walked over to the sideboard and poured herself a splash of bourbon. Neat. She turned back, drink in hand, leaning against the edge of the table.</p><p>“You proud of me?” She asked.</p><p>Agatha leaned back, letting her gaze sweep from Rio’s damp hair to the curve of her hip. “Endlessly.”</p><p>Rio took a sip, letting the quiet settle between them. The fire crackled. Thunder rumbled.</p><p>Agatha’s smile was low, indulgent, wicked. “You know,” she said, voice velvet-dipped in challenge, “if we really wanted to avoid a scandal, you wouldn’t have come here tonight.”</p><p>Rio tilted her head, the corner of her mouth twitching. “And if you really wanted me to leave, you’d stop looking at me like that.”</p><p>“Like what?”</p><p>“Like you are already undressing me.”</p><p>Agatha let her eyes drop – slowly – to Rio’s bare forearms, the way her black t-shirt clung to the shape of her chest, the damp curve of her collarbone. Then back up. “Am I wrong too?”</p><p>Rio let out a breath of a laugh and turned slightly, giving Agatha her back as she sipped her bourbon. “You’re dangerous when you’re bored.”</p><p>“I’m dangerous when I’m alone with you,” Agatha corrected, rising from her chair slowly. “And you walked in here like you forgot that.”</p><p>“I didn’t forget.” Rio kept her tone even, but her knuckles were white around the glass. “I’m just trying to remember the part where I promised myself, I’d keep this clean.”</p><p>Agatha stepped closer. “And how’s that going?”</p><p>Rio turned. She looked at Agatha – truly looked – and for a second her composure wavered. Just a flicker. “Terribly.”</p><p>Silence rolled through the study. The fire crackled behind them. Thunder rumbled low and long outside.</p><p>Agatha moved in, one step at a time. “Two weeks of pretending you don’t want me in public. And now you’re here, alone with me. You made that choice.”</p><p>“Maybe I did,” Rio said. She set her glass down without taking her eyes off Agatha. “But I’m not letting you win that easily.”</p><p>Agatha arched a brow. “Win?”</p><p>Rio moved toward her – not quite touching, but close enough that Agatha could smell the rain on her skin, the bourbon on her breath. “You think you can say a few filthy words and I’ll fall to my knees?”</p><p>“I don’t need you on your knees.” Agatha teased.</p><p>That pierced something. Rio’s jaw flexed.</p><p>“You’ve been so good,” Agatha said voice dropping. “Disciplined. Controlled. But I’ve seen the way you look at me when you think no one else is watching.”</p><p>“And what if I’ve seen the way you look at me?” Rio shot back. “Like you’re starving.”</p><p>Agatha closed the gap between them completely. Her fingers brushed Rio’s hip – featherlight – and she felt the sharp inhale it drew.</p><p>‘Then maybe we’re both overdue.” She spoke.</p><p>Rio exhaled through her nose. “I am not going to beg.”</p><p>“You don’t have to,” Agatha said, stepping in so their chests just barely touched. “I’ll do it for the both of us.”</p><p>That undid her.</p><p>Rio reached out, finally, gripping Agatha’s waist tight. But she didn’t kiss her – not yet. She just held her there, their faces inches apart, like she needed to feel the moment stretch between them.</p><p>“You’re impossible,” she said.</p><p>“And you’re still not kissing me.”</p><p>Rio leaned in, bruising her lips just barely over Agatha’s. “I want you to earn it.” She echoed Agatha’s previous words.</p><p>Agatha smiled into it – teeth catching Rio’s bottom lip in a soft bite. “I’ve been earning it since the day I met you.”</p><p>And Rio gave in.</p><p>The kiss started slow – all tension and restraint – but cracked open fast. Weeks of denial collapsed in a single breath. Rio’s hands slid up under Agatha’s blouse, dragging it over her shoulders, fingers reverent over warm skin.</p><p>“God, you’re unfair,” Rio breathed, “you weaponize this.”</p><p>“I’m the President,” Agatha said, breath hitching as Rio’s mouth found the edge of her throat. “Everything is a weapon.”</p><p>“Yeah,” Rio growled, “and you’re lethal.”</p><p>Their clothes came off piece by piece – but Rio stayed deliberate, teasing. She laid Agatha back on the rug in front of the fireplace with infuriating slowness, eyes roaming over every inch of revealed skin like she was memorizing it.</p><p>“You’re taking your time,” Agatha said, voice wrecked with need.</p><p>“I told you,” Rio said, settling between her legs. “You don’t get to have me all at once.”</p><p>She kissed her now – lower now – and Agatha arched, gasping as Rio’s mouth worked soft circles into her skin. But she didn’t give in fast. She teased her way down Agatha’s body, biting gently just above her hip, licking slowly along her inner thigh – and then pulling away just enough to make Agatha curse.</p><p>“Rio,” Agatha warned.</p><p>“Say please.”</p><p>“You’re insufferable.”</p><p>Rio smirked, “And you’re so, so wet. Want me to do something about that baby?”</p><p>Agatha gritted her teeth. “Please.”</p><p>And that was all Rio needed.</p><p>She slipped her tongue against her slowly first – deliberate, calculated – until Agatha writhed under her, nails dragging across Rio’s shoulders. Then she gave her what she needed. Fast. Deep. Desperate. And when Agatha came, she did it shaking, gasping, fists twisted in Rio’s hair as if she could anchor herself to the woman ruining her.</p><p>When Rio finally slid up, her mouth glossy, her pupils blown wide, she looked down at Agatha like she was the only thing left on Earth.</p><p>Agatha pulled her close by the back of her neck. “You’re mine,” she whispered.</p><p>Rio kissed her again, hot and deep and filled with teeth. “I am always yours.”</p><p>They made it to the bedroom half-dressed, bumping into walls and kissing like they needed each other to breathe. This time, it was Agatha who pushed Rio down, crawled up her slowly and deliberately.</p><p>She kissed her – hard, claiming – and Rio laid bare underneath her. Their mouths fought for dominance until Agatha bit Rio’s lip, not hard enough to hurt, just enough to remind her who she belonged too.</p><p>Agatha stepped back, letting her eyes drag slowly down Rio’s bare chest. “Perfect,” she said. “Look at you. Two weeks of being good, and now you’re shaking.”</p><p>“I’m not shaking.”</p><p>“You are,” Agatha murmured, dragging her fingers up Rio’s ribs, nails light. “And I haven’t even touched you properly yet.”</p><p>Rio grunted; fists clenched in the sheets. “You going to fix that, or just keep talking?”</p><p>“Oh, I’m going to ruin you.”</p><p>Agatha pushed her back again, straddling her thighs without mercy. Their mouths crashed again – teeth, tongues, moans – and Agatha’s hands were everywhere, dragging, exploring, devouring.</p><p>“I missed you,” Agatha growled. “Every time I close my eyes, I see you in that damn suit, looking at me like you’d eat me alive.”</p><p>Rio let her head fall back with a curse. “Then do it. Fucking take me.”</p><p>Agatha bit down on her neck, hard enough to leave a mark. “Oh, I plan to.”</p><p>No strap. No toys. Just her. She wanted it filthy and raw, and she wanted to hear Rio beg.</p><p>Agatha slipped two fingers between Rio’s legs – already soaked.</p><p>“Oh, you’re dripping,” she whispered, voice decadent. “You’re so fucking wet for me. Have you been touching yourself at night, thinking about me?”</p><p>Rio groaned, hips jerking into her hand. “Fuck – no. Couldn’t.”</p><p>Agatha grinned. “Good. That’s my girl.”</p><p>Rio whimpered.</p><p>Agatha stilled.</p><p>“Did you just moan from only that?”</p><p>Rio’s jaw clenched. “Don’t.”</p><p>“No,” Agatha whispered, voice deadly soft, “I think I will.”</p><p>She leaned down; her mouth right next to Rio’s ear.</p><p>“<em>Good boy</em>.”</p><p>Rio’s entire body arched, hips snapping up, a sound torn from her throat like it had been waiting to be unleashed for years.</p><p>“Oh my God.”</p><p>Agatha grinned like she’d just won a war. “There it is,” she purred. “Look at you. Fuck, that made you leak.”</p><p>“I – fuck, Agatha…”</p><p>Agatha kissed her fiercely, her hand already moving again. Her flingers slid inside Rio slow and deep, curling just right, finding the spot that made Rio cry out again, louder this time, legs trembling.</p><p>“That’s it,” Agatha crooned. “You’re doing so good for me. So tight. So, fucking perfect around my fingers.”</p><p>Rio was panting now, writhing under her. “Please – please, harder…”</p><p>“Beg me,” Agatha said. “Beg me like you mean it.”</p><p>“Fuck, Agatha, I need you, please, I can’t…” Rio’s words disintegrated into a moan as Agatha picked up the pace, fingers slamming into her with precision. “Please fuck me, please don’t stop, I need to come…”</p><p>“Who do you belong to?” Agatha asked, curling her fingers hard again.</p><p>“You!” Rio shouted. “I belong to you…”</p><p>“That’s right,” Agatha said, breathless and savage. “You’re mine. No more rules. No more rules. No more uniforms. Just you, shaking under me.”</p><p>She shifted, bringing her mouth down over Rio’s chest, biting and licking across her nipples while her fingers stayed relentless. She moaned against her skin, adding a third finger, fucking her open, making her sob.</p><p>“Agatha – oh God, I’m going to…”</p><p>“You come when I say.”</p><p>Rio screamed into the crook of her arm, shaking.” I can’t hold it...”</p><p>Agatha bit her ear, “Come for me like a good boy baby.”</p><p>And Rio shattered.</p><p>It wasn’t quiet. It wasn’t graceful. It was raw, wild, and devastating. Her whole body bucked and twisted under Agatha as she came hard, soaking her hand, sobbing Agatha’s name like a prayer and a curse.</p><p>Agatha held her through it, riding every wave with her fingers still inside, whispering. “That’s it. That’s my baby. Look at you. So, fucking beautiful when you break for me.”</p><p>When it was over, Rio collapsed back, boneless and shaking, tears leaking from the corners of her eyes.</p><p>Agatha slowly withdrew her fingers, lifting them to her mouth, licking them clean with a hum of satisfaction. “Who knew you had such a praise kink.</p><p>Rio laughed weakly, dragging her hand over her face. “You’re a menace.”</p><p>“You love it.”</p><p>Rio pulled her closer, still gasping for breath. “I do.”</p>
