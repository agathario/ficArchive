<div class="userstuff">
<p>“Mm, Agatha, your alarm is going off,” the massive lump beside her mumbles. </p><p>Agatha groans as her hand shoots out to silence her phone. She fumbles with it, hears her phone clatter on the ground. But she doesn’t care. She just wants to snuggle back into her bed, into the smell of pine that’s enveloping her senses. She burrows deeper under the covers until she’s pressed up against Rio. </p><p>“What cologne are you wearing?” Agatha asks.</p><p>“‘m not wearing cologne,” Rio responds. Her sleepy voice is deep, and so attractive, and her cock is pressing into Agatha’s hip. “I showered last night, remember? No cologne.”</p><p>Agatha presses her nose against the side of Rio’s neck and inhales. It smells so fucking good, makes her Omega whine inside of her, makes her feel deliriously wet. “You smell so good,” she says, biting at the skin.</p><p>Rio lets out a moan. “Agatha. We can’t. You need to get up and get ready.” </p><p>“I can be late.” She kisses Rio where she bit, soothing it with her tongue before leaving another bite. She’s delighted when Rio gives her a full body shudder. “I can feel how hard you are. And we had to go six long weeks without sex. Don’t you miss me?” </p><p>“I had you last night,” Rio says weakly. Her hips gyrate against the firm line of Agatha’s body, as if she has no control over it, despite what her mouth is saying. </p><p>The smell of pine is so overwhelming, making Agatha almost oversensitive already and she hasn’t even been touched. Her Omega is going crazy with it, and she’s not sure what it is or why it’s happening or why her body is affected, but she definitely doesn’t mind it.</p><p>Just as she goes to throw her leg over Rio’s hips so she can hump against Rio’s clothed dick, her phone starts to blare again. She rolls off of Rio and groans, loud and angry and frustrated. She’s going to have to go through her entire day wet and unfulfilled now. </p><p>Agatha shucks the blankets off of herself and moves to get up before she hears, “wait,” from behind her. Agatha looks over her shoulder curiously before she’s tugged down into a kiss before being pushed back up. She feels slightly dizzy, so now she’s horny <em> and </em>disoriented.</p><p>“Can I come over again tonight?” Rio asks after Agatha walks out of her bathroom half an hour later, hair waved to perfection and makeup on. </p><p>“You’ve been here for the past week and a half. Won’t your spider miss you?” </p><p>Rio pouts but she deliberates. “You’re right. I should go home and say hi to her for more than just a half an hour tonight.” But she doesn’t seem too happy about the apparent rejection, like she would rather spend time here in Agatha’s apartment with Agatha than at her own apartment with her spider and alone. </p><p>“I’ll text you on the weekend, okay?” Agatha says softly. More soft than she talks to anyone, except for her pet bunny. Soft in the way that would most definitely get her made fun of for the next calendar year by Jen and anyone within a two mile radius. “Don’t be late for work. Make coffee if you want.”</p><p>And then she’s on her way out the door with a weird sinking feeling in her gut. </p><hr/><p>She doesn’t text Rio that weekend. In fact, she makes a pointed effort not to text her. Instead, she makes plans to go out with Jen. Which must clue the other woman into thinking something is wrong because she pounces almost immediately. </p><p>“Harkness,” Jen says, like they’re run-of-the-mill Disney villains squaring off in an evil lair instead of two women who have known each other for most of their lives. “Been a long time. Thought I lost you to that poor dorky Alpha.” </p><p>“We had to go six weeks without sex, Jenny. We had to make up for lost time.” </p><p>Jen rolls her eyes. “Six weeks isn’t that long, you weren’t even celibate, and you’re not even exclusive. You could have gotten sex from any other Alpha.”</p><p>Sure, except Agatha doesn’t <em> want </em>any other Alpha. Which is something she’d come to terms with after the second week of Rio being injured and now being able to get fucked. She tried to get picked up, and she could have. She definitely could have. But she couldn’t help but compare every Alpha who came near her to Rio and she doesn’t think she could go through sex with her brain like that.</p><p>“I don’t even like Alpha’s,” Agatha says instead. “I found one I’m friends with and actually don’t hate, it’s never going to happen again.” Oh, yeah. Jennifer’s an Alpha. “No offence.”</p><p>“Been there, done that,” Jen says and Agatha gags. She tries to forget that they lost their virginities to each other, although Agatha will always say that she’s happy she had a very safe and comforting first time compared to other Omegas she knows. “It’s just… pathetic.” </p><p>Agatha tilts her head. “What is?” </p><p>“You. And Rio. You and Rio are pathetic.” </p><p>That’s so rude, but Agatha can’t help it, so—</p><p>“What do you mean? Haven’t you ever heard of an Omega and an Alpha fucking and letting off steam before? Do you know how hard it is to deal with heats alone?”</p><p>“Do you know how intimate dealing with a heat with an Alpha partner is?” Jen fires back. “You two are exclusive without the label. You’re essentially dating, you might as well give each other your mating bites now. It’s exhausting to watch you.” </p><p>Agatha’s mouth drops in indignation. Not even mock indignation, she’s borderline offended. “What are you even saying?” She can’t believe Jen is saying this. Well, no, she definitely <em> can</em>, but she can’t believe that her Omega is practically agreeing with her. Where it would usually have her hackles rising, it’s practically purring at the words. </p><p>“I’m saying that you and Rio need to get your act together. You’re obviously in love with each other, your wolves are obviously complimentary and have accepted each other. You both are freaky and weird and <em> annoying</em>, and she actually tolerates you which means she must be a saint of some sort.” </p><p>First of all, ouch. That kind of stings a little but Agatha doesn’t even flinch at the brutal honesty because she’s probably right, Rio must be a saint for tolerating Agatha with all her sharp, jagged edges. </p><p>“We like to fuck. I like to be fucked by her. I also like being her friend. There is nothing wrong with that and you are reading too far into this.” She rolls her eyes, leaning against the table. “And if I suddenly like how she smells then that’s between me, myself and I.” </p><p>“What do you mean? Like her perfume?” </p><p>Agatha’s nose scrunches in thought. “No, it’s like…” She sighs. “Before, she smelled plain. Sometimes I could pick up the slightest smell of her, like, natural odour. I can definitely smell her p—” </p><p>“—Shut the fuck up, Harkness.” </p><p>“Rude. Anyway. I could smell, like, her sweat. I could smell her shampoo in her hair. She sometimes came over smelling like dirt and mud, which could be from her greenhouse. But lately she’s smelled more… I don’t know. Musky? Like, pine. Like, when you go into the forest after it rains.”</p><p>“Okay, Nicholas Sparks, calm down a little or I really will think you’re in love with her,” Jen says with a cackle. </p><p>The laugh Agatha gives in response is robotic, her smile far too wooden. That’s such a silly idea. Agatha Harkness being in love? With Rio Vidal? An Alpha who doesn’t act like an Alpha in the slightest? </p><p>(Except when they fuck, sometimes, when Rio gets rough and gruffly talks into her ear as she pins her down and mounts her.) </p><p>Yeah, no. Definitely not. Just as Agatha opens her mouth to respond, probably something snarky that would get a drink dumped on her, a voice intervenes. “I’m sorry, I don’t mean to eavesdrop, but what were you saying about the scent of your Alpha?” </p><p>“She’s not <em> my </em> Alp—”</p><p>“Yeah, Agatha, let’s tell this nice old lady about your Alpha’s scent.” Jen’s so gleeful that it’s radiating off of her and Agatha grits her teeth. The old lady takes a seat at the table like she was invited to. And, well, Agatha supposes that Jen’s words were an invitation of some sort. “I’m Jen, by the way.” </p><p>The older woman gives a polite smile. “Lilia Calderu. Divination.” Oh, great. A hack. “Now, do go on, dear. We don’t have all day.”</p><p>Jen is hiding her smile behind her hand but Agatha just leaves it alone. She sits back in her chair, shakes out her hair. “I don’t know. She just started smelling like pine. It’s so aggravating, because the scent isn’t even that special but it calms me. And it turns me on. And if she’s there when I’m falling asleep and I’m able to smell her, I can fall asleep so quickly.” </p><p>Lilia looks pensive for a moment before she rests her elbows on the table. “Have you heard of fated pairs, Agatha?” </p><p>“I mean, of course,” Agatha replies. “It’s a myth, right? I’ve never met a single fated pair. I’ve only read about them and I’m not even sure I believe most of it.” </p><p>“It’s science,” Lilia says, in a tone that leaves no room for argument. “It’s biology. You’re able to smell your one true mate. It’s so rare because of the amount of people in the world. You can’t meet everyone, so the chances of you being able to find them are minimal. But some people get lucky.” </p><p>Jen snorts. “Are you trying to tell us that you think Agatha and Rio are fated mates?” She laughs a bit too hard for it to be warranted. “Agatha Harkness? Has a <em> soulmate</em>?” </p><p>“It’s science,” Lilia repeats. “You can’t smell my scent. I can’t smell your scent. I can’t smell Agatha’s scent. But suddenly Agatha is able to smell Rio’s scent?” She raises her eyebrows. When no one replies, she looks at Agatha contemplatively. “Do you know if Rio can smell <em> your </em> scent?” </p><p>The night Rio gets injured plays in her head. </p><p><em> You smell like purple</em>.</p><p>At the time, Agatha brushed it off, because what the fuck does that mean? She smells like purple? That could mean anything. It could’ve been the good sex, it could’ve been the smell of her slick. It could have been anything. It doesn’t necessarily mean her <em> scent</em>, right? </p><p>“Your eyes lit up like you remembered something,” Lilia acknowledges. “What is it?” </p><p>“Nothing,” Agatha mutters. “I have to go. Thanks for the enlightening conversation, but I don’t have a true mate. I’m destined to be alone by myself.” </p><p>“No one is destined to be alone,” Lilia tells her, voice too gentle. Too motherly, in the way her own mother never was and if Agatha starts to cry because this random stranger lady is showing her kindness then she will never live it down. “It’s something to think about. And if what I’m picking up from you is correct, your Omega is completely amendable to this Rio being your mate.” </p><p>Agatha downs the rest of her drink and stands. “Well, it’s been swell getting therapized by a total stranger and a woman who hasn’t touched an Omega since me, but I have to go.” She knows she’s being a little mean. Maybe rude. But she doesn’t care. </p><p>She also doesn’t wait for a reply. She just walks away and heads back toward her apartment, where she plans on washing her sheets and trying to rid herself of Rio’s scent. </p><hr/><p>It doesn’t work. No matter how many times Agatha washes her bedding, she can still smell Rio’s pine. She can still smell it in her clothes and in other parts of her apartment. It’s pissing her off, especially when she’s forcing herself to ignore any and all contact with Rio. </p><p>She even does research about fated mates. Everything Lilia said has been scientifically backed. Even by her former university. Even by people she respects. There are millions of articles, of stories, of experiments. And everything leads back to the answer that Agatha was fearing: Rio is probably her soulmate and the universe is cruel. </p><p>Agatha manages two weeks without seeing Rio, kissing Rio, fucking Rio. She manages to even avoid texting Rio back unless absolutely necessary. She feels awful, like something is missing, but she doesn’t want to dwell on that. </p><p>
<b>RIO [2:34 p.m.] </b>
</p><p>It’s been a couple of days. Are you okay? </p><p>
<b>RIO [6:17 p.m.] </b>
</p><p>Agatha? Did I do something? </p><p>
<b>RIO [9:45 p.m.]</b>
</p><p>I’m getting nervous. I’m coming over.</p><p align="right">
<b>AGATHA [10:03 p.m.]</b>
</p><p align="right">no dont i dont want company </p><p>
<b>RIO [10:04 p.m.]</b>
</p><p>Too late, I’m already outside. </p><p>
<b>RIO [10:06 p.m.]</b>
</p><p>Please open the door. </p><p>
<b>RIO [10:09 p.m.]</b>
</p><p>Please. </p><p>Agatha’s heart clenches uncomfortably behind her rib cage and she feels like she can’t breathe. Her Omega is fighting her tooth and nail when Agatha doesn’t open the door, when she doesn’t reply to Rio’s text. </p><p>And then she hears a key in the door, hears the lock unhatch and watches as the door opens. Her first thought is: fuck, Agatha regrets giving Rio that spare key. Her second thought is: fuck, Agatha really missed her and she can’t help the pathetic way her lungs constrict when she sees her. </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio breathes out as soon as she shuts and locks the door. She looks a little wrecked, a little off kilter. Sexy in a way that Agatha has never seen her. </p><p>Agatha almost can’t help herself when she strides forward and kisses Rio with everything she has in her. Rio kisses back immediately, her hands grasping at Agatha’s waist tightly, like she might fly away if she doesn’t. And honestly, Agatha could. </p><p>She winds up bent over the back of the couch before long, Rio’s cock dragging deliciously inside of her, her hands holding her waist so tight that Agatha knows she’s going to bruise. She feels so good, she smells so good, her scent is everywhere and now she’s <em> inside her</em>. </p><p>“Fuck, Rio, baby,” Agatha moans into her arms. She arches her back more, pushing back against Rio’s hard thrusts, knowing that the neighbours downstairs are definitely getting more than they pay for in their rent. “God, you feel so good.”</p><p>“You feel good,” Rio grunts. Her thrusts speed up, her scent somehow gets stronger in a way that Agatha doesn’t think she’s ever smelled before. It makes Agatha’s body warm, makes her orgasm crash into her like a crash. “Missed you so much, baby. Missed your pretty pussy, missed your hair, missed your voice.” Her hips stutter before she presses in even deeper. “Missed how you smell. Fuck, you smell so good.” </p><p>Those words almost push Agatha into a spiral but instead she presses her fingers onto her own clit and comes again, tightening around Rio enticingly. She feels Rio’s hot come deep inside her, feels it drip out of her when Rio pulls out. </p><p>She’s spun around, pressed against the couch, and she knows she’s going to have stains there from the come dripping out of her. From her slick <em> and </em> Rio’s come dripping out of her. God, she’s never going to be able to sell this thing. </p><p>“You smell like me now,” Rio growls. </p><p>“Are you in <em> rut</em>?” Rio’s teeth scrape against Agatha’s neck and Agatha gasps. That answers that question, then. That explains it. </p><p>“God, your smell. I couldn’t stop thinking about your smell.” Her voice is huskier than Agatha has ever heard it. Her touch is more possessive. “My Alpha wouldn’t settle. Anytime I thought of you, it howled. I needed to be here. <em> I need you</em>.”</p><p>Hearing that makes an absolute mess in Agatha’s mind, makes her pussy clench around nothing, makes her moan. “Rio,” she mumbles. “Rio, it’s just your rut.”</p><p>“No, it’s <em> you</em>. It’s you, and how you smell, and how my Alpha needs you. It’s you.” </p><p>Agatha swallows. She can’t kick Rio out like this. She needs to get her in bed, get her asleep. She needs her to sleep this off before she says more things that will completely send Agatha to ruin. </p><p>“If I let you fuck me in the shower, will you take some meds and go to sleep? I’ll sleep in the bed with you.” </p><p>Rio nods, nosing at Agatha’s neck, “Anything you want, baby.” </p><p>So, Agatha pulls Rio into the shower stall with her. Lets Rio wash her hair, lets Rio fuck her against the wall with Agatha’s leg over her hip. Lets Rio come so deep inside of her that she thinks she’ll smell like her for days. Lets Rio maneuver Agatha into the position she wants when they get into bed and snuggle up next to each other, after Rio swallows down her meds. </p><p>And then she’s out like a light. She’s holding Agatha so tightly that she’s not sure she could wiggle out even if she wants to, and she’s terrified to find that she doesn’t want to. She feels safe in Rio’s arms, feels wanted, feels like maybe they are something more than Agatha thought they were. Like she’s more important to Rio than she ever knew. </p><p>When she blinks awake, she doesn’t even know what time it is. She just feels the tip of Rio’s cock nudging against her thighs. “Are you awake?” Rio whispers against her skin. Agatha just nods, pushes her ass back. </p><p>Rio doesn’t go inside. She slips her cock between the snug space between her thighs, brushing against Agatha’s pussy with every pass, but doesn’t slip inside. No, she just keeps thrusting forward gently, and somehow this is even hotter than being fucked into the mattress.</p><p>Somehow, when Rio’s hand reaches under her body to grasp her breast and tweak her nipples to hardness, when her cockhead nudges against Agatha’s clit, when she can hear the lewd, wet sound of Rio’s cock rubbing between her thighs and up against her slit, it’s hot enough to push her into orgasm.</p><p>It only takes a couple more thrusts for Rio to come too, painting Agatha’s thighs and getting on the bedsheets below them. Agatha groans internally. She’s never going to get Rio’s smell out of it now. </p><p>“You’re so hot, baby,” Rio says. And she’s nosing at Agatha’s neck again, like she can smell her. Like she knows what Agatha smells like.</p><p>Rio just continues nuzzling against Agatha, rubbing her face against her skin like a cat. Agatha lets her for a little bit before she mutters, “Rio?” She hears an affirmative noise of acknowledgement behind her. “Do you only want me right now because of your rut?” </p><p>“My rut is not influencing me right now,” Rio says after a moment of silence. “Last night… maybe. But I’m here because I want to be.” The words hit Agatha square in the chest. “Can you tell me why you were ignoring me, now? I think Jen might know but she refused to tell me.”</p><p>Agatha squeezes her eyes shut, clenches her jaw. She figures she can’t hide from this anymore. She’s doing a disservice to herself and to Rio. And to her sex life. She might as well come clean about everything to Rio and if Rio rejects her, then Agatha can finally try to move on. </p><p>“Can you smell me?” </p><p>“Yeah,” Rio says simply, quickly, like it’s not something that has been a point of contention in Agatha’s mind for the past month. </p><p>“What do I smell like?” </p><p>Rio’s chin hooks on Agatha’s shoulder and she inhales. “Purple.” </p><p>
<em> You smell like purple.  </em>
</p><p>Again, what the fuck does that mean? What does purple even smell like? It’s a fucking <em> colour</em>, not a scent. And Agatha asks as much, letting all of her frustration seep in.</p><p>“Like…” Rio sighs. “Like. The most beautiful, purple flower you’ve ever seen. Violet. Powdery. Floral. Something so divinely feminine. Like, when you look at the colour purple and you can just imagine what it smells like. That’s what you smell like.” </p><p>“I smell like purple,” Agatha says, like a realization. </p><p>“Mm,” Rio says, nosing her neck again. When Agatha turns around to face her, Rio makes a noise of complaint before her eyes focus on Agatha’s. Then she smiles, so gently, and her eyes soften. “There you are. There’s my girl.” </p><p>If Rio makes Agatha cry, she’ll never forgive her. </p><p>“You can’t just say shit like that,” Agatha mutters. </p><p>“Why not?” She tilts her head like a cute chocolate lab. “You are mine, right? Isn’t that what this conversation is preluding to? I know the lore, I know the history, I know the science. And I also overheard Jen’s conversation with Alice about fated mates and the things a kooky old woman told you before you decided to try to ghost me.” </p><p>Agatha groans and closes her eyes. “Goddamn it.” </p><p>Rio chuckles, but then she reaches up and she cups Agatha’s cheek. The pad of her thumb rubs gently underneath Agatha’s eye until she gets the hint and opens up. “Are you upset about it? Is it because it’s me?” </p><p>“No,” Agatha says automatically. “That’s not why at all.” She shakes her head, swallowing. She’s never been good at the feelings thing, never will be, but she’s tired. She has to try. Just once. “I never thought being mated was in the cards for me. And then finding out the universe made the only person I ever felt comfortable with the person who was biologically meant for me…” She trails off. “I want you to want me because <em> you </em>want me. Not because biology does.”</p><p>“I have wanted you since before I could smell your purple,” Rio promises. “I have wanted you since the first time we kissed. But I knew I had to be patient and I think you’re worth waiting for.” She smiles gently. “Even if you weren’t my fated mate… even if our wolves weren’t meant for each other… I’d still want you to be mine.” </p><p>Agatha’s eyes fill with tears but she wills them back the best she can. “Really?”</p><p>“Really,” Rio says. “I’m stupidly in love with you. And I think you’re in love with me, too, but I didn’t want to push you. I wanted you to come to the realization yourself.” </p><p>It’s such a Rio thing to say that Agatha starts to laugh, and then she can’t help the tears, and then she’s curling into Rio and allowing Rio to comfort her. To hold her, to calm her with her scent. </p><p>“I love you too,” Agatha mumbles into the skin of Rio’s chest. She can’t look at Rio while she says it, not yet. Possibly not ever. And she probably won’t say it much because it’s hard. But she can say it this once, she can say it once for Rio so she knows. </p><p>And the asshole says, “I know,” which makes Agatha laugh, and makes her lean up to kiss her. </p><p>Soon enough, Agatha isn’t thinking at all. She’s just allowing her Alpha to take care of her, to fuck her into the mattress, to scent her. </p><p>“When I mate you,” Rio growls into her ear, “the first thing I’m going to do is knot you like the pretty little Omega you are. Like you deserve.” And Agatha shatters around her cock, under her, feels her the wetness of her orgasm on her thighs and on Rio’s thighs. “Such a good girl.
