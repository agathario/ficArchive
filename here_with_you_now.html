<p>
      *****
     </p>
</center>
<p>
     The warmth of the Auckland sun had begun to heat the bed chambers of the houseboat that sat on the coast of Bayswater Marina, a sure sign that it's occupant had overslept.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft sigh passed through slightly chapped lips as the woman in the bed sat up, arms reaching upward, pulling, tugging at the muscles that had been idle from sleep. A soft squeak of satisfaction filled the air as she settled back into the mattress, palms flush against the gentle fluff of the duvet. Bare feet touched the cool and dark hardwood floors and her eyes slid closed, the last air of sleep passing through her lungs in a light sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of the waves lapping against the side of the home had always brought her peace, and it was the best thing she felt she could ever wake to. Or, one of them at least.
    </p>
<p>
     Soft footsteps carried her to the small bathroom with the camp shower and drain sink as she peered into the mirror.
    </p>
<p>
     Dark but warm eyes met her, still a little cloudy with sleep, thin lines pressed into her right cheek from the folds of the pillowcase she had been laying on. Her dark hair spilled in soft but disheveled waves over the tops of her shoulders and she could tell that if she didn't tend to her drying lips, they were going to end up splitting.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio Vidal was a simple woman. She lived in the water, she worked from the office on her house boat, consistently working on the coding to complete the pollinating drones she had spent the last six years working on, and her daughter was coming close to closing out her senior year of university in Queenstown.
    </p>
<p>
     Estrella Vidal was Rio's pride and joy. She had her mother's smile, the same cheekbones and jaw. There were even days when Rio saw a reflection of her own gaze when she looked into her daughter's eyes. It had been the two of them against the world, and they had made it this far.
    </p>
<p>
     That wasn't to say that perhaps there weren't certain facets of Rio's life that could have been considered... a little lacking.
    </p>
<p>
     Although she tried to avoid the conversation every time Estee brought it up, her daughter knew she was lonely. She played it off with ease; work kept her busy, tending to the boat occupied her time, and of course she attempted to spend every waking moment with Estee when she flew home from school. She was honestly surprised that she hadn't asked outright: "When are you going to let yourself be loved?"
    </p>
<p>
     Although she told anyone who wasn't her daughter that asked that she didn't, she remembered the name of Estee's father, but she had buried it deep, only ever unearthing it for the only person who had a right to know.
    </p>
<p>
     When Estee had turned eighteen, Rio had finally decided that it was time to tell her the heartbreaking truth of how she had come to be her mother's pride and joy. Rio had been a little older than Estee was at the time, in college. There had been a party, she had left her drink unattended. She had stirred in an unfamiliar dorm, an only semi-familiar man in the bed next to her. Her body had ached, torn from the inside out, but she had forced it into motion. She had dressed herself, collected what she could find of her things, and left before he had ever even stirred.
    </p>
<p>
     Four months later, she found out she was pregnant.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee had teared up, but because she understood so many things that had been unspoken through her entire childhood. What she voiced to Rio that had bothered her the most about the entire thing was that Rio had always made it out that it had been his choice to leave, but not that it had never really been her choice to have her life flipped on its head.
    </p>
<p>
     As tough as it had been to have that conversation, Rio knew that it had strengthened their already iron-clad bond. Estee fully understood the extent of the lengths Rio would always go to in order to see that she had a good life. She saw her mother's sacrifice and realized that without it, she would have never existed. Rio had gotten lucky with that one, and she knew it. Estee was an incredible kid, and Rio had been told multiple times that it was all in how she had raised her; she treated her like she had always been a human being before anything else, even a child. Life was a fickle thing, and Rio hadn't taken to the idea of sugar coating pain and heartache. She wanted Estrella to understand life before it upended her own.
    </p>
<p>
     It really had been her biggest pride, watching her little girl grow and flourish into a young woman, watching as she made her way through uni, fighting every step of the way for her psychology degree. Sure, Rio had achieved her own triumphs, but something about watching her daughter take life head-on and win? It was even sweeter, even more to savor.
    </p>
<p>
     She finished brushing her teeth before she ran a hand loosely through her hair to try and tame some of the stray strands that whipped and twisted into a halo -- or crown -- atop her head.
    </p>
<p>
     As her feet carried her to the kitchenette, her fingertips traced gingerly over a photo of the two of them together that was pinned to the refrigerator with a magnet. She pulled the door open, a deep frown forming at what she saw on the inside: half a bottle of orange juice and half of a cucumber. Well, she had apparently forgotten that a market run had been a severe necessity. An annoyed huff of a sigh passed through her lips as she withdrew the orange juice and shut the door, making haste in pouring herself a small glass, stowing the remaining juice for another time.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood, poised at the edge of the dining room table as she sipped at the juice, her eyes tracing gentle lines over the view outside of the window, the other homes, the bridge that crossed over the marina, close and wondrous in structure, sometimes casting a cool afternoon shadow over her deck when the sun hit just right. Maybe that was what she would do today; she would spend the day outside. Well, after her market run, of course.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, she had set about her day. She watered the throngs of plants that clung to or hung from every surface available in the home. They were one of the many things she was proud of, the ones both inside and out. She changed her clothes and grabbed her keys, departing for the market.
    </p>
<p>
     As the sun climbed higher in the sky, it was quickly becoming another hot Auckland day, and Rio was secretly hoping that she would catch the shadow of the bridge pillar enough to enjoy some respite from the heat later.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon her exit from the market, her phone buzzed in her pocket as she closed the back hatch of her car and she fished it out, her smile instant at seeing a text from Estee.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi, mama. This is your daily reminder that I love you. And you are a badass."
    </p>
<p>
     A soft chuckle passed through her lips as she made her way around to the front, sliding into the driver's seat.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you too, roo," she texted back stowing her phone as she started the car.
    </p>
<p>
     The most arduous part of grocery shopping? Getting everything inside, hands down. By the time Rio stowed the last two items, bottles of white wine, her face was flushed and she was ready to grab a book, pour herself a glass of that wine, and spend the afternoon bathed in the hot fall day.
    </p>
<p>
     As it so happened, pretty much all of that had gone to plan. She had changed into shorts that were perhaps a little too short for public purview and a soft pastel green tank top, a lighter color for more reflective purposes. She hid her eyes behind a pair of aviators and pulled her hair into a messy bun atop her head.
    </p>
<p>
     It was what happened in the middle of her solitude that threw the outlook of her day into a blender at full speed.
    </p>
<p>
     She had heard her before she had seen her.
    </p>
<p>
     A woman's voice echoed off of the water, rising and dipping in volume as she was traversing the bridge, on the phone with someone. The alarm in Rio's eyes was masked behind the sunglasses she wore as she watched cyclists heading toward the woman. The closer they got, the more they shouted in their thick Kiwi accents, not that dissimilar to her own (though her own was only considerably a trace, tinged with her Puerto Rican upbringing). The woman looked confused, but tucked her head and kept walking.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh no, Rio thought, this was not going to end well.
    </p>
<p>
     She was on her feet, pacing over to the edge of the deck as she tucked both pinky fingers beneath her tongue. She exuded a loud whistle, which caught the woman's attention. Rio took her in for a split second; her long dark hair whipped gently in the wind behind her, her tall frame well dressed in a cream button down and waist high plum trousers. She lowered the phone, having noticed that Rio was trying to get her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can I--?" the woman had started, but she was cut off when another cyclist came whizzing by, bumping into her. What happened next almost didn't seem real. The force of the hit, and where it was placed, sent the woman lunging forward from where she stood, with just enough momentum that she flipped over the railing and dropped about seven or eight feet into the water, her phone launching out of her hand, landing in the water a good ten feet away. Immediately, Rio rushed to the side of the deck that was closer to the bridge, pushing the gate open so that she could drop the ladder, her head lifting as she saw the woman surface.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is there something you wanted?!" the woman nearly shrieked as she began to tread over to where Rio was, if for no other reason than realizing it was the quickest route of escape.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips tugged upward, stuck in something that was halfway between a smirk and a truly amused smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "You were walking in the bike path," she stated, holding out a hand for the other woman to take so that she could hoist her onto the deck.
    </p>
<p>
     As their hands clasped, the woman's expression was sheepish, realizing that she had indeed brought this upon herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hoisted her out, taking half a step back as she gave her a once over, pressing her lips into a thin line.
    </p>
<p>
     "Give me a second." She disappeared inside and returned with a towel, handing it over. The woman began to dry herself to the best of her abilities, but Rio could literally see the realization hit her quickly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Shit," she hissed, and Rio's gaze cut to her. "I dropped my phone."
    </p>
<p>
     "Its okay, you can use--" she tapped her chest, where she had stowed her own phone, but it was gone. It was, she realized, at the bottom of the water, right next to the leg of the ladder from where she had leaned over to help her out.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well. Fuck."
    </p>
<p>
     The other woman's eyes widened slightly, but she did not appear to have lost much composure, despite the fact that she was soaking wet.
    </p>
<p>
     "Tell ya what," Rio offered, tilting her head innocently. "I can give you a change of clothes and dry those off for you. And then I can take you wherever you need to get to, if you'd like."
    </p>
<p>
     The stranger considered a moment, tapping a finger to her pointed chin. "You know, most people at least offer to buy me dinner before they ask me to strip down," she replied, a clear light dancing in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     The urge to fumble was strong within Rio, but what came out was far smoother than she had thought herself capable.
    </p>
<p>
     "Right, right. How rude of me. Would you like to join me for dinner?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio almost had to ask herself who she thought she was, talking to this woman like that. Was she
     <i>
      flirting?
     </i>
     She couldn't even recall the last time she had done such a thing.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman's eyes glimmered, bright in the light of the afternoon sun.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, she gave her this smile, this knowing and pointed smile that said more than what rolled off of her lips. "Do you care if I rinse off? Marina water is... ugh." And then it hit Rio. The accent. This woman was American.
    </p>
<p>
     "No problem. The washroom is directly back and to the left. Towels are in the cabinet and help yourself to the closet, whatever is most comfortable. I'm going to head back outside, feel free to join me when you're done."
    </p>
<p>
     The woman offered a soft thanks, and Rio did as she stated she would, and returned outside. When the woman resurfaced a little while later (admittedly a little later than Rio had expected), there was a second wine glass and the chilled bottle sitting next to it on the table set beside Rio, another chair on the opposing side.
    </p>
<p>
     "Help yourself," she indicated with a flourish of her hand as she rose and took the wet clothing from the woman, hurrying inside to throw them in the dryer, turning it on. The thing was ancient, and needed replaced, but it would get the job done, albeit slowly. When she returned to the deck, the brunette was perched on the once empty chair, the now-full glass of wine in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... erm--" she breathed a nervous chuckle, drowning it with a gulp of the wine. "Sorry, I guess, for crashing your afternoon."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head. "You crashed nothing. I was just reading when I saw you in the path of an onslaught, so I thought I might be able to play hero, but I've really got to work on my timing," she teased, her eyes sparkling behind those sunglasses.
    </p>
<p>
     "I suppose I could have been more mindful. I guess I'm used the the world moving around me, most of the time." She snorted a soft chuckle, taking another pull from the wine glass.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would admit, there was this air of confidence that seemed to encompass this woman. Even with wet hair, having just climbed out of a marina, there was just this aura about her, bright and burning hot. It was enchanting, to say the least.
    </p>
<p>
     "At least you got free wine out of it?" Rio posed, hiding her smile behind her own sip of the crisp liquid. Her eyes lifted, drifting over to the profile of the woman.
    </p>
<p>
     She was striking, truly so. Her features were sharp and pointed, yet somehow still soft in the right places. There were the lightest of lines that stemmed from the corners of her eyes, wrinkles that came for years of smiling, of laughter. Her eyes were a glimmering blue when the sun hit them just right, sparkling like the water often did at sunset. Her lips--
    </p>
<p>
     Woah.
     <i>
      Woah.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio blinked, thankful for the protection the sunglasses on her face had to offer when it came to the look that had flashed across her dark green eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     What was she thinking? It was true, Rio had been alone for over twenty years. It had always just been her and Estee, and she had never once considered bringing someone else into their fold. Hell, she still wasn't, but this was the first time in an incredibly long while that she felt this unfamiliar pang in her chest. Was it--? No, it couldn't be. She had just met this woman twenty-five minutes ago. She couldn't be attracted to her.
    </p>
<p>
     She took another large gulp of the wine, her eyes casting out in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Free wine never hurts. Especially when you're nursing the sting of being a complete idiot."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio laughed, a truly delighted but gentle sound that was light and filled with a genuine joy, her head turning as she took in the sight of the woman, who she realized was looking at her, a little wry smile twisting up her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's okay, I promise. Mistakes happen. But, to be noted, you learned your lesson, hm?" A brow hiked over the thin frame of the aviators, and the smallest smirk tugged at the corner of her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, thank you," she said softly and Rio's expression loosened.
    </p>
<p>
     "You don't have to thank me. It was sort of my fault anyway. You were just sort of... magnetizing."
    </p>
<p>
     If she didn't know any better, she could have sworn that for the briefest moment, the other woman blushed. Before the moment could hold any gravitas, her voice sounded, drawing Rio's attention.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you live here alone?" she asked coolly, casually.
    </p>
<p>
     "I do. My daughter often stays when she's not at university, but otherwise, it's just me."
    </p>
<p>
     She could almost hear it, the way those eyebrows shot up from across the table.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're old enough to have a kid in university?" she asked, the sound of her voice bordering on the edge of disbelieving. This drew a smirk from Rio, her eyes watching the water patiently, carefully. "I call shenanigans."
    </p>
<p>
     Another laugh slipped through Rio's lips, her head turning again. She raised a hand, palm out, and placed her other to her chest. "Honest truth!" she responded, though the grin on her face was wide. She was flattered, honestly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well. I wouldn't believe it," she countered, glancing over to take Rio in, that light dancing in those gorgeous blue eyes again. "But I'll give you the benefit of the doubt."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned again, another sip of wine landing in her stomach as she tried to quell the dull heat that had started to burn somewhere in her chest. What was she doing? Why did she feel like she had known this woman for years instead of minutes? Why did she feel like this woman could see right through her?
    </p>
<p>
     "What about you? Do you have kids?"
    </p>
<p>
     The woman gave a soft nod, a gentle expression blanketing her features. It was clear that there was an affection there.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have a son. He just turned twenty a few weeks ago. He's currently living in Dubai pursuing his social media empire," she informed her, though Rio could almost hear the unmuttered scoff that wanted to follow the last part of that sentence.
    </p>
<p>
     "And your husband?" Rio asked it before she could think it through; she was an unwed mother, it stood to reason that this woman could be too.
    </p>
<p>
     But the sound. That
     <i>
      sound.
     </i>
     It was loud, boisterous and thoroughly entertained. The laugh that escaped the brunette almost startled her, but then it warmed her. It was a beautiful sound, almost heart-stoppingly pristine in its magnificence. And then, she realized what she was laughing at. Shit.
    </p>
<p>
     "I divorced him ten years ago when I realized that what we wanted out of life was never going to be mutual. I'd rather be alone than sacrifice large parts of myself to make someone else happy." Her voice had started strong, but the longer she talked, the softer the tones became. Rio knew that feeling, she knew it deep in the fabric of her bones. She knew what it was like to want to hoard the good pieces of yourself for fear that giving them to someone else could break you.
    </p>
<p>
     The silence fell between them, a gentle understanding, but before Rio could thrum on to the next topic, the other woman's voice hit her ears.
    </p>
<p>
     "I've never been on one before," she commented, her gaze sweeping. "A houseboat, I mean."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's smile tugged again, this time a little warmer, a little softer. "It's pretty much the same as a house. But this one's old. Needs a lot of work. And a laundry set up that isn't a half day project," she added, chuckling softly.
    </p>
<p>
     "So we have time, then, is what you're saying?" the other woman questioned with a brow quirked.
    </p>
<p>
     "It is," Rio responded.
    </p>
<p>
     The other woman lifted her glass. "I'll drink to that."
    </p>
<p>
     The rims of their glasses touched with a soft
     <i>

     and both women threw back the remnants of the wine. Rio reached for the bottle, refilling her own before she held it up in question to the other woman, who held her glass out in response. Rio filled it, then set the empty bottle on the ground at the base of the table, leaning back in her own chair.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you really want to stay for dinner?" Rio asked, and though she had pushed it out confidently, there was the smallest twinge of something -- hope, perhaps -- that tempered it's certainty.
    </p>
<p>
     Those blue eyes cast over to her and with the sun beginning its descent in the sky, the orange tones seemed to accentuate those sharp and beautiful features, elevating them to a stunning degree. There was a smile across those lips, one that was prodding, daring. Rio could almost see it in her eyes: She had suggested, but not expected the invitation.
    </p>
<p>
     "That depends. Can you cook?" she posed, her brow arching in curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's response was immediate. "Would I be offering if I knew I'd embarrass myself?" she posed back, that smile still stuck to her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Fair enough. What would be on the menu tonight, then, chef?"
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel it, feel the bow of this woman's confidence gliding over her, playing each string with exact precision like the fiddle that she was. Her dark eyes darted behind tinted lenses, searching her face for -- what even was she looking for? Approval? Interest? Engagement?
    </p>
<p>
     "It's nice enough I had planned to grill. How does steak and potatoes sound?"
    </p>
<p>
     She could see the delight immediately write itself across her face. "That sounds great, actually," the woman responded and Rio gave a decisive nod.
    </p>
<p>
     "Steak it is then."
    </p>
<p>
     She had excused herself to prep things and had returned ten minutes later with everything she would need, and another bottle of wine, uncorked, in one hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "For you, my lady," she offered with a soft laugh, one that was echoed by the woman's laughter as well. She handed over the bottle and set to work, taking only a few more moments before she closed the lid of the grill and resumed her spot on the left side of the table.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, you're American?" Rio posed casually, trying actively to hide the interest in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman nodded, that icy gaze sweeping over to her.
     <i>
      Gods,
     </i>
     Rio thought,
     <i>
      she really was so beautiful.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     No. Absolutely not.
     <i>
      Stop it.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "I was born in Salem, Massachusetts, but I've lived in Los Angeles for the last thirty years." She paused, watching Rio's face, and then spoke again. "Two very different ends of the spectrum, when it comes to America. Also, two different ends of the country, too."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded in mild understanding; she had heard of LA. It was a hub for the entertainment industry. Everyone knew that, though. Her knowledge beyond that much? Well, it was pretty limited.
    </p>
<p>
     "And you?" she posed, her gaze seeming to pry, to peel a little bit as it bore into her, though her own eyes were still shielded. "That accent isn't strictly here."
    </p>
<p>
     "I was born in Puerto Rico," she admitted, glancing down into her wine. "We moved when I was six, and I've just... never left, which was my father's intent. We left after my mother was taken from us and upon arriving, he denounced our citizenship." Rio paused, sensing that she was providing a little more detail than was necessary. "So... My whole life is here. Well, in the country. She spends the majority of her time in Queenstown."
    </p>
<p>
     The woman's lips curled a bit more, into something more of a smirk. "I thought I heard something else, there. It's... different. It's..." This time, her lips twisted in thought before she spoke her last word. "Beautiful."
    </p>
<p>
     The heat on Rio's neck was instant and she willed it away before it could manage to seep onto her cheeks. It was stupid, wasn't it? The woman wasn't calling her beautiful, just a tone or cadence she had not heard before. It wasn't about her, it was just the way she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned back in her chair, but as she did so, she reached up, boldly removing the aviators before she set them down on the table, her dark gaze falling forward.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... are you here on business or pleasure?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Business," the woman responded, continuing, "But it's a Saturday and it was filled with meetings. I was actually on the phone with my best friend, coordinating a gin date for when I got back to the hotel when--" She flourished a hand to indicate their current situation. "Y'know," she added, as if to accentuate her point, though the way her lips slid back to reveal that beautiful smile, Rio thought it to be infectious, eliciting the same reaction from her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I travel a lot. Part of the job, I guess. Maybe it wouldn't kill me to be still for an evening."
    </p>
<p>
     The way she said it, something about it struck Rio. This woman was a shark. To stop moving would be her undoing.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is all of the travelling for work?" Rio posed for the sake of conversation. She knew she had no business asking these questions, thinking she would get answers, but she couldn't seem to stop herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "Most of it," she responded with a light shrug, an air of ease about her. "But I'm no stranger to the occasional vacation, too."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's dark gaze was caught on this woman, watching the astonishment in her expression as she took in the sights, the sounds of where they were. There was mystery, there was intrigue, but there was also... just pure curiosity. Suddenly, her head turned and Rio found herself eye to eye with her since the first time she had taken off her sunglasses, and honestly? It felt like she was crystal clear, like this woman was peering right into her, right through her.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet, what she said when she spoke was not even a fraction of how intense that stare was.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, what is there to do? I'm here til Tuesday, and I did manage to only have one meeting scheduled for tomorrow. What's something I absolutely have to do before I go?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a moment to rectify where this conversation was in her head and where it actually was, though her cool exterior never wavered.
    </p>
<p>
     She pondered her response for a moment. "Do you like rugby?" she asked curiously, and the smile she got was almost breathtaking.
    </p>
<p>
     "I do, but the All Blacks don't play until Thursday. I already checked."
    </p>
<p>
     "Damn. The hakas alone are worth it. That energy? Insane." Rio tapped a finger to her chin in thought, her eyes casting out toward the open sky. "If you can take the time," she started, looking back over at her. "I highly recommend the blue pools at Haast Pass. It's a little hike, nothing too crazy, but it's home to the most beautiful glacier-fed pools. It's... astonishing." There was something on her face, as she peered at Rio, that same cutting gaze that was still somehow warm and soft. It was reading her, assessing her, devouring her. She didn't speak, so Rio continued. "There's also Waikawawu Beach Tunnel. It's not as remote, but the beach is only accessible by a tunnel that was hand-carved in the 1900's. Man-made, but beautiful."
    </p>
<p>
     "You love it here," she commented, and Rio softened, giving a gentle nod.
    </p>
<p>
     "The majority of my memories are here, on that water, on the sand, in the city. It's been my night and day for most of my life. It's... my peace."
    </p>
<p>
     The other woman smiled, revering her with a sense of understanding that Rio could see in her eyes. There was something else there, too, something she could not quite name. Perhaps it was a sense of jealousy, but Rio saw no reason for such. Her hum drum existence, her very tiny place in the world, was worth no amount of jealousy.
    </p>
<p>
     A push of wind sent the scent of the grill in their direction and Rio's eyes widened a bit, having completely forgotten about the food.
    </p>
<p>
     "Shit!" she muttered, launching to her feet to tend to the grill. After a moment, the heat in front wasn't the only heat she was feeling. The other woman's eyes were on her, hot and searing, just watching her. She confirmed this by glancing, just briefly, over her shoulder to discover that she had been right. The heat crept up again, but this time she decided to use the guise of the grill to cover the flush on her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     She closed the lid and returned to her spot, plopping down a bit unceremoniously. "Another couple minutes and it should be ready," she informed her, reaching over to pick up her wine glass again.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're... quite nice," the woman said, causing Rio to turn her eyes toward her again, a disarming curl of her lips happening.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean... there really was no other choice here. I was really bad at the hero thing, so the least I could do is dry your clothes." Her shoulders lifted, then sank, in a light shrug. It made sense to her. She considered herself kind, sure, but this was something she felt the owed this stranger.
    </p>
<p>
     The brunette looked like she wanted to argue, but she tempered it with a knowing smile. Perhaps too knowing. It made Rio shift slightly in her seat, and while she wouldn't admit it, the way the other woman was slowly slipping beneath her skin, it made her nervous -- but excited at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     The sun was sinking further now, the oranges fading into purples and navies. She wanted to keep the conversation going, to ask questions she didn't know she had, but her mind wandered back to that grill.
    </p>
<p>
     That damn grill.
    </p>
<p>
     She excused herself once more and removed the meat from the grill, shutting it off before she made her way inside to ready their plates. It took her only a couple of moments, but before she returned, she stuck her head out the door.
    </p>
<p>
     "Would you like to eat out here or inside?" she posed, her tone sweet, showing that she did not care either way.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman's eyes swept the exterior again, as if looking for something specific. Her eyes met Rio's again across the deck.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you have any lighting out here?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio offered a small smile, leaning down at the base of the wall to plug in the string lights that ran around the trellis that lined the deck.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have a couple of candles, too, if you'd like."
    </p>
<p>
     "Ooh, like a date?" the woman posed, her grin wide and wicked. Rio would have never fessed up to it, but immediately, a burst of heat flared somewhere in her middle and she actively battled herself to not let it show on her face. It was an uphill battle; she hadn't been on a date since college. She hadn't felt any swell of affection in decades, for anyone that was not her child.
    </p>
<p>
     The other woman's stare was steely, but there was this underlying warmth that Rio could not push aside. Her lips cracked, though, parking way into a charming smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "Candles would be nice."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still fighting the flicker of a flame that was burning inside of her as she turned to head back inside, grabbing a couple of pillar candles and a lighter, returning to set them on the table between them. With a deft quickness, she lit them and stowed the lighter in the pocket of her shorts. She dipped back in one more time, this time returning with the plates in hand, setting them down and handing over the silverware.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman looked utterly enthralled, almost like she was ready to salivate at the drop of a hat.
    </p>
<p>
     "This looks amazing," she informed her, looking up at Rio with a gentle light in her eyes. "Thank you."
    </p>
<p>
     "You can say that when it doesn't turn out to have the consistency of shoe leather," she responded back with a gentle chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     As it turned out, Rio knew her way around a grill. The two women ate, keeping light chatter, though it appeared as though they were wise enough to reserve the actual meat of their conversation for when it wouldn't be interrupted by chewing. The woman thanked her again as Rio rose to take the plates back inside, but she also got to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     Shit. The clothes.
    </p>
<p>
     "We can check on the-- um, the dryer."
    </p>
<p>
     The sudden prospect that their time was quickly drawing to a close grabbed Rio up by the throat, giving a firm squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't ready.
    </p>
<p>
     The two shuffled back into the living quarters and Rio dropped the plates into the sink. "Do you need anything else?" she asked softly, as if prolonging the inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
     "Could I have a glass of water?" the woman asked, and Rio obliged with a nod. She pulled down a glass, filling it, and handed it over. She couldn't seem to keep her eyes off of her, watching as she took a few passive sips, but then realized she was staring and diverted her gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     "Let me just -- uh -- check on your clothes."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glided across the floor to the laundry area, not even hearing the gentle footsteps behind her. She turned to open the door to the dryer and suddenly, the other woman was far closer than she had realized, the glass still in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     It would have been so easy. She was closed enough that all Rio had to do was take half a step into her, and they'd be close enough to--
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Damn it!
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was again fighting the flush that was trying to overtake her. She fought it, shoved it down as far as she could. Instead, she offered a nervous smile, maneuvering enough to pull the door open so that she could feel inside. Much to her heightened disappointment, they were dry.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood to full height and indicated the open dryer to allow the woman to pull her clothes out.
    </p>
<p>
     Those blue eyes studied her long and hard, and she felt so impossibly transparent, like she could see every scribbled thought in Rio's brain about how good of a time she'd had, about how badly she didn't want it to be over, about how she wanted another hour, or two, or five. Then, those eyes shifted down and hesitated a long few moments on the dryer. In one fluid motion, the woman bent over, the glass of water still in her hand, and tossed the contents of it inside of the dryer. She stood, adjusted the almost-too-tight t-shirt of Rio's she had on, and pressed the 'start' button again.
    </p>
<p>
     "I guess they needed a little more time."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked up at her in astonishment. Her words seared themselves into Rio's chest, sinking into the bones of her ribcage. That hadn't been prompted, hadn't been something she would have ever asked for. More time with this stranger certainly was not something she would have objected to, but for the call to be out of her hands, and in this woman's? It made her feel good. It made her feel valuable. It made her feel wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     Someone had chosen her.
    </p>
<p>
     Something close to a smirk had graced Rio's lips. None of this made absolutely any sense, but if this woman was going to give her what she was craving in the form of more time? She wasn't going to argue with her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Since your water is gone..." Rio offered, her eyes flickering down to the empty glass and then back up again. "Does that mean you might like more wine?"
    </p>
<p>
     There was a flash, something bright and undeniable, behind those gorgeous eyes, and the grin that accompanied them. It caused Rio's heart to beat just hard enough to catch in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     "I would love more wine."
    </p>
<p>
     The pair returned to the deck, placing themselves in the chairs they had been occupying, but a soft silence fell over them like a warm blanket. Rio turned to the right, taking in the view of the woman next to her. She was a sight, surely, in that t-shirt and those shorts that had actually belonged to Estee. Her eyes searched out over the coast, the incredulity there prevalent, even from a profile view.
    </p>
<p>
     "I imagine it's nothing compared to LA," Rio offered gently, pulling the woman's attention, but she didn't turn her eyes away from the sight she was beholding.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's different, but in a good way. LA is towering buildings with lit up windows and peeks into other worlds. And sometimes, the sunsets are amazing too. But this?" There was a sense of awe in her tone, twisting around her words as her eyes lifted to the clear sky. "The lights, they're beautiful, but it's the fact that you can have them at the same time as getting to have the stars. That will never, ever happen in LA."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze followed, her head tilting back as her eyes fell on the dark navy canvas, speckled with hundreds of lights.
    </p>
<p>
     She was quiet for a long moment, thinking, pondering, calculating. She wanted to ask something, but knew what kind of question it was.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can I ask you something a bit personal?" she asked, her eyes trained on the other woman, who turned to meet her eye-to eye. "With the caveat that your answer doesn't really matter one way or another, I'm just curious."
    </p>
<p>
     The curiosity was there, in that gaze that was boring into her, looking into the very depths of who she was. But then, a ghost of a smile graced the woman's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "You absolutely can."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes turned out again, toward the water. "Do you... believe in God?"
    </p>
<p>
     She had almost expected a laugh, a bark of irritation, but was instead met with silence. She snuck a glance over and could see the answer forming behind her eyes. The way her lips twisted and the cheek closest to Rio pulled in, like she was chewing on it, piqued her interest. Being in the throes of thought looked good on her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Thinking looked good on her?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Jesus Christ. What was
     <i>
      wrong
     </i>
     with her?
    </p>
<p>
     Fortunately, Rio seemed to tune back in at the most opportune time.
    </p>
<p>
     "I was raised Catholic," the woman stated, her fingertips tracing lightly over her own chin as she spoke. "It... justified a lot of shitty things that happened in our rural town. By the time I left and went to college, though? I realized something incredibly important. You cannot believe something
     <i>
      and
     </i>
     know it at the same time. You can absolutely
     <i>
      believe
     </i>
     that there is a higher power, but only because there is no way to
     <b>
      know
     </b>
     there is one." The woman's lips pressed together as she searched for her next words. "I know that we have
     <i>
      one
     </i>
     life on this
     <i>
      one
     </i>
     planet, and at the end of the day, we really do little more than walk each other home." Her gaze dropped into her wine glass, a soft and sad chuckle passing through her lips. "I don't know how we got here, or why we are here. One thing I do know? Life goes on, so long as we choose to keep letting it. I know that inevitably, we are our own makers. Does that make
     <i>
      us
     </i>
     gods?"
    </p>
<p>
     In that moment, Rio had sat, completely rapt by every word that was coming out of her mouth. She wasn't sure what she had been expecting when she had asked such a question, but the answer? She was a bit gobsmacked, slightly lost for words. This woman had such an undeniable eloquence to her, to everything about her. From the cadence of her tone to the way she used her hands to accentuate the words she said, it was so...
     <i>
      divine.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Their eyes met again, and she spoke, turning the question on Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you?"
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      I could believe in you.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The thought was brief and fleeting, but it caused a prickle of electricity at the base of Rio's neck. She instead fought the urge to look away from this woman's scrutinizing gaze, holding it as she formed her answer.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know," she finally admitted. She began to ease her gaze off of her, moving it to the scene splayed out before them. "I've looked for reason in my life, spent time trying to decide if things happen for a reason, or whether it is all just harsh coincidence. I've wondered if things like pain have purpose, of if it's all just some random lottery of meaningless tragedy." She paused, glancing down into her glass, before she looked back up, still not braving to meet that icy blue gaze. "I don't know that I've ever reached a conclusion, but most days, I lean toward the latter." Her voice, while it had been soft already, dropped a little lower, a gentle hum in the night. "But I sit here, and I soak this all in..." her hand flourished to the sights before them, the home beneath them, and her sitting there right next to her, "and moments like this sure make me wonder."
    </p>
<p>
     Her gaze lifted and swept across that table, finding that white hot stare studying her, dissecting her, picking her apart. And then, those features smoothed, almost as smooth as the words that floated from her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nothing wrong in having hope that the good can balance the meaningless tragedy. Be it by the natural order, or by divine intervention."
    </p>
<p>
     That's what this was, wasn't it? It was the universe, sticking its fingers in their lives, pushing them together, forcing them to cross paths. Destiny wasn't real, but this? It was... something.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe it does. Maybe... I just need to look for it a little more often." Rio's eyes were stuck, studying this being in front of her. This confident, bold, beautiful being that she did not want to see leave.
    </p>
<p>
     A heavy and thick silence fell between them; they were just learning, just looking, just studying. But then, Rio's voice came in a rushed murmur.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know, if you wanted to stay longer... you could have asked."
    </p>
<p>
     Those blue hues crackled with lightning for the briefest moment, but Rio didn't miss it.
    </p>
<p>
     "But we have no agenda," she returned, as if the choice had not already been made.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat back in her chair, her eyes flickering down to the remaining bit of white wine in her glass. She pursed her lips for a quick moment as she thought.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well," she started, tracing over her chin with the tip of her finger in thought. "We can stay out here and enjoy the evening, or I have a pretty hefty DVD collection. Disclaimer, though, a good eighty percent are nature documentaries."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, there was something amused that crossed the woman's features. It was playful, happy. Rio felt almost bashful at the look she was being given, but she fought herself to not let it show.
    </p>
<p>
     "We can go inside," the woman suggested, lifting up her own glass to drain the last bit of wine. She stood and held her hand out expectantly. Rio's eyes fell down to it, then back up to her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Shouldn't
     <i>
      I
     </i>
     be the one to lead? It
     <i>
      is
     </i>
     my house," she questioned, quirking a brow.
    </p>
<p>
     "I've seen enough to have a good idea of where to go," she responded, and there was a fluttering in Rio's stomach, a ripple of butterfly wings tickling every inch of her ribcage from the inside. Aha, that was why it had taken her a little longer to resurfaced after her shower. She had been scoping her out.
    </p>
<p>
     In the world they lived in? That was fair, and honestly? It didn't bother Rio in the slightest.
    </p>
<p>
     She slid her palm into the other woman's this time, instead of the other way around. She let her pull her inside and toward the den, exactly where they needed to go. Inside was a small sofa, a bit outdated but comfortable enough, and a little stand that had a twenty inch television on it that was hooked up to a DVD player that came straight out of the early 2000's.
    </p>
<p>
     She could see the amused light flickering in the other woman's eyes, but she tried not to let it phase her. This wasn't a place she spent much time, but it was still somewhere she could relax. She indicated the stacks of DVDs and sat down on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     "Guest's choice," she voiced, watching the woman as she took to the task of selecting something.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes dared to linger on the tall, muscular but slim frame of the woman. Her legs were toned and slightly tan, though smooth all the way down as they came down from the openings of the shorts. There was a gentle curve of her ass in those shorts, shorts that didn't come up high enough to meet the bottom of that damn t-shirt. There was the smallest sliver of skin, probably so warm.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck.
     <i>
      Snap out of it, Vidal.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     After a moment, the brunette sat back on her heels, looking at the case in her palm. She looked up, glancing over her shoulder at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "This was filmed near here?" she asked, holding the case up to show Rio what she was referring to. It was a documentary about the wildlands that were located roughly twenty minutes up the road. She gave a slight nod accompanied by a gentle smile. She watched with interest as the woman popped it out and slid it into the tray of the DVD player. She got to her feet, placing herself on the couch next to Rio, though notably, there were a couple of inches of space between them. That was fine with Rio, honestly, because this woman had her so fucking nervous already.
    </p>
<p>
     And for what?
    </p>
<p>
     It did seem, for the time being, that she truly had been interested in the documentary. As the time wore on, though, Rio noticed that she became increasingly restless, trying to shift and stir to get comfortable. It was getting late, but she knew the dryer had at least another hour on it from the stunt she had pulled earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     "You can.. you know, get comfortable. It's okay," Rio assured her. They locked eyes for a moment, and it appeared as though the woman read this as a soft challenge. She shifted, pulling her legs up to curl them as she moved to her side and laid her head right in Rio's lap.
    </p>
<p>
     Her head was right there, laying on top of Rio's thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio was about to combust.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mmm, better," the woman mused, though her tone was rich and dark, unlike any use of it Rio had heard before. The way she spoke, the tone she used, the words she chose, it made it so infinitely difficult for Rio to not reach down, run her fingers through those soft brown locks.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a battle she won for all of five minutes. Almost mindlessly, her hand dropped and her fingers made a gentle sweeping motion, back and forth, as the tips of them carefully combed through her hair, soothing and sweet. Even though it was something she had not done... well, almost ever, it was almost terrifying how easy it felt to carry out.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't sure how long she had been at it, but something caught her attention: It was the softest of snores. Her eyes dropped to see the form of the woman in her lap, her chest rising and falling evenly, slowed by her slumber.
    </p>
<p>
     A gentle smile curled Rio's lips, but something else happened, too. There was a pang in her chest. Maybe it was of loneliness, or maybe it was of fear. She knew that in three days, this woman would be back on a plane to America and Rio would become just a memory. But damn it if she didn't want her to go.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly and carefully, Rio slid herself out from beneath the woman's head, supplementing her absence with a throw pillow. She reached up and pulled the blanket off of the back of the couch and draped it over the woman's thin frame, making sure she was completely covered. With that, she turned on her heel and made her way to her own room, changing out of her day clothes and into a pair of pajamas, which didn't look much different. As she climbed into bed and laid her head down on the pillow, she knew that sleep was going to be an elusive entity that night, and she had been right.
    </p>
<p>
     She woke with the sun as it clawed it's way over the horizon; glancing over at the clock, she realized she'd only been asleep for an hour. Well, today was surely going to call for a nap. She sat up and rubbed at her eyes, the weight of the previous day settling in over her.
    </p>
<p>
     Shit.
    </p>
<p>
     There was still someone in her house. Or, at least, she hoped there was. She was quiet as she threw back the duvet and scrambled to her feet, tiptoeing out into the rest of the house. As she reached the den, the warmth returned to see the woman still asleep on the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     She had stayed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio busied herself with pulling the now truly dry clothes out and folding them before she left them on the small coffee table in the den, there for her whenever she woke up. She knew that she needed to keep busy, in order not to fixate, but she had no clue what to do. So, she took to the kitchen, cleaning up the dishes from the night before, and then decided on brewing a pot of coffee. Halfway through that, she decided on pulling out eggs and bacon, setting to work on making a quick breakfast for the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
     She was halfway through her task when she heard a soft shuffling behind her. Her head lifted and her warm and sweet smile was instantaneous. There she was, dressed so smartly in that blouse and those trousers. Her hair cascaded down her shoulders in loose waves.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Gods. What a vision.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "Good morning," the woman greeted.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good morning. Coffee's on if you want some. And I'm making eggs and bacon," she informed her, though there was an underhanded offer in there, an unspoken request for just a little more time.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could sense the rejection coming, though, from about a mile out.
    </p>
<p>
     "I really should get going. I am sure there at least a few concerned people waiting to hear from me," she explained, and Rio could feel herself deflate inwardly, though she didn't let it touch her exterior. "But thank you, this has all been so kind of you, -- uh..." she trailed, a flash of panic in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     In an instant, the same flash mirrored in Rio's eyes. She froze, though, and the words came spilling out, breaking the dam of her nerves before she could think to stop them.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was my pleasure, really, -- er..."
    </p>
<p>
     And then, there it was. A silent agrement between the two of them: This had been a night, one that had been nearly tangible in its excitement, but that was all it was ever destined to be.
    </p>
<p>
     Just a night, where two strangers who did not even know one another's names, simply enjoyed one another's company.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman hesitated, just for a moment, and took a step that Rio thought was going to carry her toward the door, not toward her instead. She was suddenly right there, their fronts brushing ever so slightly. Both of her warm palms raised and slid to the curves of Rio's jaw, holding her face as if it were fragile glass. They eyes met, those blue irises staring into the deepest parts of her for the split second she stood still. And then, she felt the tug, the pull that was asking her to come halfway.
    </p>
<p>
     She caved, leaning in toward the other woman as their lips brushed, first, almost barely, and then met full on in a warm kiss that seemed to tangle its way through every inch of Rio's body. It was warm in its inception, but the seconds ticked on and the heat started to rise --
    </p>
<p>
     And then, suddenly, cold. No warmth, no skin. Just cold air.
    </p>
<p>
     But, it was only because the woman had been holding her breath. She exhaled, her warm breath on Rio's face, their foreheads barely brushing.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Thank you,"
     </i>
     she breathed. Her eyes flickered open, beholding Rio at close range.
    </p>
<p>
     She could almost feel it, the fight within the other woman, but she let Rio go, and Rio's heart sank at the same time, in sync with the other woman's hands.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio offered her a tight, if not sad, smile, and gave a nod of understanding. She watched as the woman turned, making her way to the front door. She stopped, though, and for one fleeting moment, Rio thought she might stay.
    </p>
<p>
     But then she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I won't forget you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze was unwavering as the door closed behind the woman, and closed on any hopes that she might have found an actual connection with another human being.
    </p>
<p>
     The sting felt more like a burn and it was instant, flaring in every last nerve she had. Her chin dropped and she exhaled a quiet sigh, her teeth digging softly into her bottom lip.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You might. But I won't."
     </i>

</p>

<p>
     That nap Rio had been so intent on taking when her guest from the night before had left? It had never happened. Instead, she had picked at the bacon and eggs she had cooked, spending the majority of her time pushing it around the plate. For as hungry, genuinely hungry, as she had been before that woman had walked into her kitchen and out of her life, she now could hardly stomach the idea of putting another bite in her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     She had tried to tidy up; she put the throw pillow back where it belonged and folded the blanket back up so that she could drape it across the back of the couch as it had been before she had stormed in and flipped everything Rio had thought she'd known on its head.
    </p>
<p>
     Every time she thought about it, part of her was a little indignant. She was upset with herself. She had made no move, at the woman's prompting, to introduce herself. By a general rule of thumb, then, she could not rightfully be upset over the fact that the woman had not offered her name, either. It had been a mutual mastery of the situation, a grasp that they lived two different lives. In fact, she had no idea what the woman did for work that had brought her to the reaches of New Zealand. Then again, it wasn't like she had offered her own profession up for discussion.
    </p>
<p>
     There had seemingly been more important things to talk about.
    </p>
<p>
     That stupid conversation about religion kept replaying in her brain. She could see it, projecting on the front of her skull, a vivid memory as she had watched the other woman as she had provided her answer.
    </p>
<p>
     She had locked every hand wave, every gesture, every tone shift into her head like it was a treasure, coveted by all who sailed the seven seas. It was her treasure. Her stash, one that no one else got to see or touch. It was a memory, something for her to cling to when she needed to recall something that would make her feel the edge of life again.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned, looking down at the folded t-shirt and sleep shorts she had lent to her the night before sitting on the coffee table.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Why couldn't she have taken them? It would have given her an excuse to come back.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio cursed herself for such a line of thought. That would have had to mean that the other woman would have seen last night with the same value Rio did. Judging by the fact that she had left, and not given her even an inkling of how she might find her? Well, Rio was of the very clear opinion that some people did not want to be found. Some people walked away because they never looked back.
    </p>
<p>
     It was discouraging, but she was quickly climbing to the realization that this was something she would have to let go.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried. She really did.
    </p>
<p>
     But
     <i>
      she
     </i>
     was...
     <i>
      everywhere.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     When she had finished picking up and cleaning up her failed attempt at breakfast, she realized that there was a very important task she had needed to handle. She grabbed her keys, climbed into the car and made her way into the city to the mobile shop in order to replace the phone she had dropped when helping that woman out of the water. It had taken a little over an hour, and she went straight back home, both feeling like she wasn't out long enough and also like she couldn't get there fast enough.
    </p>
<p>
     There, she could live in the remnants.
    </p>
<p>
     There, she could hold onto that magic.
    </p>
<p>
     After a brief period of setting up her phone, she had headed to the deck, picking up her book. She opened it, her fingertips gliding over the edges of the pages that remained for her to read. And again, she tried. She started to read, and then, five minutes later, she was re-reading the same paragraph for the twelfth time, still having absolutely no clue what it said.
    </p>
<p>
     Her palms on either side of the cover pressed inward and the book closed with a tight snap that wasn't quite as loud as her frustrated grunt. She had started to set the book down on the table, but hesitated only a moment as her phone began to ring. She made the exchange, setting the book down to pick up her phone, her lips curling up warmly at the sight of the name on the screen.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, roo," she cooed gently, leaning back into the chair, tilting her head back in the sunlight.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi, mama!" Estee's tone was bright and it made Rio's heart squeeze in her chest. "I was just calling to make sure that you were still going to be able to pick me up Saturday! My flight should be in about eight that morning."
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, baby. I've been counting down the days. Did you get the money I sent you?" Rio's voice was smooth and gentle, strongly affectionate. It would have been clear to anyone that would have looked in on her life from the outside that the most important thing in her entire life was that young woman.
    </p>
<p>
     She could hear Estee roll her eyes, even over the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, mama, but I told you that you didn't have to do that."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could hear the admonishment in her daughter's tone, but it just caused her to smile, bright and wide.
    </p>
<p>
     "Let me take care of you, yeah? One day the roles will be reversed," she reminded her with a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "And that's the one reason you won't be going into a care home," Estee responded, to which Rio delivered a dramatic gasp. "Hey! I said you
     <b>
      won't!
     </b>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed again, truly tickled and amused. That girl was her lifeblood.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... anything exciting happening lately?" Rio could hear it in Estee's tone; she was fishing. And this one time? Maybe Rio would offer a bite.
    </p>
<p>
     "I need to go back to the market," she stated offhandedly, as though Estrella was not entirely aware that she had been the day before.
    </p>
<p>
     "What did you forget?" Estee shot back, a thin line of anticipation winding its way around her words.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nothing. I just... had a dinner guest."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Estrella was unable to hold in her gasp.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama! What?!"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was red instantly, her thoughts back on that mysterious, alluring, beautiful, sexy woman.
    </p>
<p>
     "Spill!"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips twisted as her free hand picked at the hem of her shorts nervously. This was a first. In twenty one years, it was the very first time she had anyone, or anything, to talk about in this manner with her daughter.
    </p>
<p>
     "I was outside reading yesterday after I got back, and I heard someone up on the bridge. A lot of the bikers were shouting, but the woman kept walking."
    </p>
<p>
     There was a quiet interest on the other end of the line; Estee was already hanging on every word.
    </p>
<p>
     "I whistled at her and as I got her attention, a cyclist bumped into her... and ay dios mio! She fell right into the marina!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama! You're lying!" She could hear it, that hike that she had never heard before. She could hear the excitement, hear the thrill that this was bringing to her little girl.
    </p>
<p>
     "She swam over and I let her on the deck. She lost her phone, and I dropped mine when I went to help her out. Just got it replaced a little bit ago."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee was giggling, a pure and raw sound that often made Rio's heart thud a little harder in her chest. It was everything.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, I got her a towel and offered to dry her clothes. In that five hundred year old dryer."
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama, no," Estee gushed, the giggles overtaking her again.
    </p>
<p>
     "We had some wine, I grilled us some steaks. We, uh... ended up watching a movie."
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, okay. Now that's bordering on too much information," her daughter countered, but she couldn't help but roll her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, silly. We watched that documentary that was filmed in the wildlands. Well, we were watching it, until she fell asleep."
    </p>
<p>
     There was measured silence, surely as Estee was trying to decide if her mother was telling her the whole truth, which she almost immediately had decided she wasn't.
    </p>
<p>
     "So are you going to see her again?" she asked, and Rio could already feel the wave of her disappointment rushing in to shore.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, roo. She left this morning before breakfast was done. She... didn't tell me her name."
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh no."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips pressed into a thin line and her fingers picked even harder at the fraying edges of the short. She had really fucked things up for herself, hadn't she?
    </p>
<p>
     "It's okay, baby. It was a good night. I forgot what it was like to sit down with another adult and have a conversation about anything other than the coding algorithms it takes to make a pinto bean sized drone fly."
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama?" Estee spoke, her voice soft.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, baby?"
    </p>
<p>
     "You're a fuckin' nerd."
    </p>
<p>
     Their laughter was an echo on either side of the line and they spoke for a few more moments about random odds and ends until Estee had announced that she needed to head to class. Rio had told her she loved her, that she would see her on the weekend, and that they would buy extra champagne for their annual Oscar viewing party, which elicited a squeal of delight from the younger girl.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Te amo, mama."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Every time she heard those words, she could feel the warmth, like the same warmth she would get every single time Estee wrapped her little arms around her from the time she was a toddler until most recently as of two months ago.
    </p>
<p>
     The words were enough sometimes.
    </p>
<p>
     They mattered.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Te veo, mija."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There were times, especially on days like that one, where Rio just wished that her daughter was closer. She was feeling the acute sting of loneliness in a way that she had never before dared to let herself feel. She was closed off and guarded for this very reason. She was lonely by choice, she told herself. Or, at least, she had been. It had been her decision to not pursue relationships, to not seek out companionship. She had all she needed in the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Now?
    </p>
<p>
     Now, she had this deep rooted, rotting ache in her middle, one that told her this was the first time she had ever wanted something like this. Now, she knew what it was like to want something and have absolutely no way of attaining it.
    </p>
<p>
     The passing two days, they had been filled with an agonizing sense of restlessness. No matter what Rio did, her mind often wandered. She thought about the woman, about her smile, her eyes, her
     <i>
      laugh.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She thought about that kiss. Gods, what it was like to feel that way for the first time in so long. The pulse pounding, the warm heat that pooled so briefly in the pit of her stomach, the weakness in her knees, it was all etched into her grey matter, scarred deep within her brain tissue.
    </p>
<p>
     She thought about the sound of her voice, smooth like velvet and intentional in her usage of tone. She spoke with forethought, with a plan on her delivery.
    </p>
<p>
     That woman knew her words mattered.
    </p>
<p>
     The two empty bottles of wine had sat at the foot of the table for the first day before she finally had the courage to dispose of that memory, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Tuesday had rolled around and as she tried to move about her day, something kept whispering in the back of Rio's mind.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      She
     </i>
     was leaving, going back to America.
    </p>
<p>
     Her fingers hovered over the keys of her computer, her eyes staring blankly into the screen ahead of her, the coding completely jumbled as she tried to process it.
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn't do it anymore. She'd waited two days, hoping she might come back. She never did, though. Sitting around acting like she would? It wasn't doing Rio any good. So, to combat the sting, she shut off her computer and changed into a swim suit, two pieces, and threw a few things into a beach bag. If she couldn't escape
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     by sitting around, she would go out in an attempt to drown the memory from the depths of her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been enjoyable enough; the sun had been warm and the water had been cool and refreshing in a way she had not allowed herself to enjoy in some time.
    </p>
<p>
     The weight of life sometimes felt a little too heavy, and in the passing days, the weight of Rio's loneliness had started to crush her. The worst part about all of it was that there really wasn't a remedy here. There was no possible way that she would ever see
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     again, and she had absolutely zero interest in throwing herself into any kind of dating pool; that had never changed. What had changed was that she now knew she was
     <i>
      capable
     </i>
     of attraction, it just happened that she found herself attracted to completely the wrong person. She had let one person in close enough to develop even the smallest bond, and then she had blown it all to pieces because she couldn't help but to speak before she thought about what she was going to say.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Damnit,"
     </i>
     she hissed under her breath, reaching up to adjust the sunglasses on her face. Her skin was warm and tan from the hours she had spent in the sun, but it hadn't helped in her main goal of distancing herself from that night. Instead, she was coming to the realization that she could do her best to outrun every thought of the woman, but there was absolutely nowhere that she was going to find to hide.
    </p>
<p>
     There was an air of indignance about her as she got up and gathered her things, heading back to the car, not wanting to go home quite yet but knowing it was the only destination. She heaved a sigh and started the drive back, though the closer she got, something in her tugged. It pulled, it nagged, it begged her to go a different way. She had ended up on the other side of the marina, and just as she asked herself what she was doing there, her eyes lifted and she saw it.
    </p>
<p>
     The bridge.
    </p>
<p>
     She hesitated only a moment before she cut the engine and pulled the keys. She climbed out and with even, measured steps, she paced toward the opening of the bridge, starting to cross it, though she was on the correct side. She reached that point, the one she could still see so clearly in her head. She looked both ways and stepped forward, her eyes casting down onto the marina, then drifting to her own home. This was the last vantage point the woman had seen before she had toppled into Rio's life and made her question far more than she was comfortable with. This was the sight, the last glimpse of what Rio had looked like before
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     white hot existence had set Rio's world alight.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips pressed firm and she breathed a light sigh out of her nose. She needed to go home. She needed to sleep, something she hadn't done in a while.
    </p>
<p>
     She climbed back into her car and made the short trip around the marina, pulling into the lot that was a small walk away from her home. As she approached the walkway, something caught her eye. There, hanging on a rogue nail that stuck out of the docking post and glimmering in the setting sun was an earring.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't just any earring.
    </p>
<p>
     It was
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     earring.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's breath hitched in her chest and she reached out, though she pulled her hand back before her fingertips made contact with the black and silver dangle. It wasn't going to bite her, but the fact that it was there in the first place was enough to sting. How? She had been back and forth a few times in the passing days, and she knew it hadn't been there. She slid it off the nail and held it in her palm, almost afraid that if she held it too tight, it might shatter like an illusion. It was there, though, really there. It was right there.
    </p>
<p>
     Why was it there, though? The safest explanation, and the one Rio knew she had to cling to was that she had lost it. Someone had spotted it near the post and put it up to make sure it was seen. It was just a trinket that had been forgotten about.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Like me.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She had let herself fixate for a few hours, but ultimately had placed the lone earring in her jewelry box and shut the drawer. If she put it out of sight, it might lend to letting her stop thinking about her a little sooner.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the week had carried on, and by the time Rio found herself driving to the airport to pick up Estee, she had almost managed to push the woman from the weekend before completely out of her head.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Almost.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She had been surprised at the lack of push she'd gotten from Estee once she had gotten in the car; she'd expected her to give her the third degree, to rake her over the coals about the weekend before, about the nameless woman that seemed to have deeply unsettled her. Instead, she had been almost
     <i>
      too
     </i>
     affectionate. She talked about wanting to do things on her break that they hadn't done since she was little; she wanted the zoo, wanted to bake, wanted to go to the beach. By the time she suggested getting sushi -- which Rio knew she hated -- the jig was up.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright," Rio voiced, flipping down the indicator for her turn signal. "What is going on with you?" She looked to her left, taking Estee in measuredly as they sat at the red light. She looked... sheepish?
    </p>
<p>
     "Nothing, mama. I just... want to keep you busy."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio balked slightly, blinking at her daughter. What was that supposed to mean?
    </p>
<p>
     "Whatever happened that night... you've been different." Estee's eyes widened as Rio's head jerked back slightly, her brow furrowed in distaste. "Not bad different, just... Sad."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips twitched downward in the pull of a frown.
    </p>
<p>
     "She really did something to you, didn't she?"
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio had always been rather open and honest with Estrella, there were just certain things that she had never learned to talk about. Any kind of romantic feelings? Well, those were right at the top of the list.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's just it..." Rio started, pressing the gas hard enough to make their turn. She pressed her lips together, her grip tightening a little on the steering wheel. "She didn't... really
     <i>
      do
     </i>
     anything. She was..." she blew out a soft puff of air, knowing there weren't words. "I just... I wish that if she knew she wasn't going to come back, she wouldn't have kissed me."
    </p>
<p>
     In the blink of an eye, Estee's arm flew out and grabbed Rio's, her eyes wide and wild as she took in her mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "MOM!" she exclaimed, the use of the word causing uncomfortable goosebumps to sheet Rio's skin. She hated it when she called her mom. "You guys
     <i>
      kissed?!
     </i>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio could no longer fight the small satisfied grin that wanted to overtake her lips. She let it. "I mean...
     <i>
      she
     </i>
     kissed
     <i>
      me,
     </i>
     but yeah."
    </p>
<p>
     "Way to really bury the lead there, mama," Estee chastised, and Rio offered a soft laugh in response. Surely, there was more to unpack there, but for the time being, Estrella knew to let it be.
    </p>
<p>
     The weekend seemed to fly by; they went shopping, had a meal out, got ice cream. The two of them walked down the beach as the sun was setting in the sky, and by the time they retired, Rio had realized that she had hardly thought about
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     since her earlier conversation with Estee, and she felt a little proud. Of course, this devolved into diving right back into those memories, but the few hour long run had been a triumph in its own right.
    </p>
<p>
     Sunday was slow and lazy for them; she made them pancakes and they lounged around most of the afternoon, reading on the deck for the most part. The evening started to roll around and Rio couldn't ignore the excitement that had been bubbling in her daughter for the last few hours. She had pulled down the popcorn, threw it into the pan and put a lid over it, a waiting game until it was finished.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee pulled out a bottle of the champagne Rio had bought and artfully popped the cork before she filled the two flutes Rio had set out for them. Maybe the tradition was silly, but it was something they had done since Estee was just a kid.
    </p>
<p>
     "Any personal favorites you're rooting for this year?" Rio posed, pulling her own flute in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     "There's one that came out a few months ago... God, I can't for the life of me remember what it's called. It's about the same crime happening in exactly the same place four times over a century. I've heard it's really good, and is leading the pack."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio plucked a piece of popcorn off the top of the finished pile and popped it into her mouth. "Hm," she hummed, chewing as she dumped the popcorn into a large bowl for the two of them to share. "Sounds interesting."
    </p>
<p>
     They had missed most of the red carpet, but she didn't mind. Instead, they settled into the couch, watching the Oscar awards on that twenty inch TV. Best Director was up and for a brief moment as they announced the nominees, Rio's attention pulled to her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's the one I was talking about," Estee divulged, but Rio glanced up only for a moment, her eyes falling back down.
    </p>
<p>
     She scrolled for another moment and dismissed the email, locking her phone as they announced the winner.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And the Oscar goes to... Agatha Harkness for 'The Travelers.'"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     As if something reached beneath her chin and pulled her gaze up, Rio's eyes fell on the television.
    </p>
<p>
     She froze.
    </p>
<p>
     No breath, no beat of her heart.
    </p>
<p>
     No
     <i>
      fucking
     </i>
     way.
    </p>
<p>
     There she stood, even far more elegant than Rio would have ever given her credit for from memory. She was clad in a breathtaking purple dress --
     <i>
      what an amazing color on her
     </i>
     -- that shimmered in the right light. Her hair was curled in loose ringlets and her makeup made her look even more beautiful, which Rio had been convinced had not been possible. That woman had been flawless, covered head to toe in ocean water, and yet, in that moment, on that television screen?
    </p>
<p>
     She was a deity to be worshipped.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama?"
    </p>
<p>
     There was no fucking way. Not in any universe could this be happening.
    </p>
<p>
     "Estrella," Rio managed, her tone tight and strangled.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama, are you okay?"
    </p>
<p>
     "That's
     <i>
      her,
     </i>
     " she breathed, but Estee didn't make the correlation.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, mama, that's the director of the film I was telling you about."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head shook, her skin flushed and sweltering under the new found heat of realization.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, no. I mean... that's
     <i>
      her. That's the woman that fell into the marina.
     </i>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     Estee blinked at her, clearly trying to read her, trying to decide if her mother was completely and utterly fucking with her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're serious?" she asked for clarification, her green eyes searching her mother's face as if she might find any indication that she was not being honest.
    </p>
<p>
     But she was.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded, swallowing down the rock in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     No wonder she hadn't wanted her to know her name.
    </p>
<p>
     She was
     <i>
      Agatha Fucking Harkness.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio didn't need much more knowledge than she already had to know that what had happened? It was cemented into memory, solidified into being something she would never have again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was just... Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     And Agatha Harkness? She was a renowned film director, her life thriving in the hustle and bustle of LA.
    </p>
<p>
     While Agatha was a memory for her, she knew that she would have been considered lucky to have been given a second thought by the other woman.
    </p>
<p>
     It all made so much more sense, now.
    </p>
<p>
     They weren't just on different pages, they lived on entirely different planets.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, Rio would move on. For now? This felt like a wound that she needed to take the time to lick.

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     For one single, solitary moment in her life, Rio had wished that Estee was back at school. What had followed her revelation had been an absolute grilling. Most of it, she had managed to dodge, but she gave up enough to assure Estee that she had been telling the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     Just enough.
    </p>
<p>
     There was still a secret she had been keeping close to the vest, one she failed to mention even over the course of the next two weeks.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      She still had that earring.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She knew it was foolish; she was still primarily convinced that it had been a lost item, that someone had seen it, realized it was close to her home, and put it where they knew someone would inevitably find it. There could be no other explanation, no clear line of reasoning, and Rio refused to let her mind get carried away with extremely unlikely scenarios.
    </p>
<p>
     So, she simply didn't mention it.
    </p>
<p>
     She instead chose to enjoy the break with her daughter, doing the things she had asked, like making a trip to the zoo, going out to surf on a couple of mornings. It was good, quality time. There were sometimes moments when she would catch Estee's stare, the way she watched her with deft cunning, a silent but wise observance. Rio had ignored it, for the most part, and continued to prattle on about whatever it was they had been discussing. She saw it, though. She knew it was there.
    </p>
<p>
     She was thankful enough that she wasn't as inquisitive for the rest of her time as she had been that first night, but there was a strange crackling in the air as she drove them back to the airport so that Estee could finish her final semester. They usually held conversation in the majority of the time they spent together, but this ride was turning out to be uncomfortably quiet.
    </p>
<p>
     At last, Rio couldn't take it anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     "What's going on?" she posed, and while the question was direct, the delivery was soft and tame, tempered to be understanding.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's lips worried together, her gaze shifting over to her mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think you should go to America."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's reaction, it was completely automatic, an utter knee-jerk reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     She laughed. It was a bellowing, hearty, surprised almost-cackle that she had never heard from herself before. She glanced over at Estee, as if she would be laughing just as hard, like it was the funniest thing in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't, though. In fact, she looked a little off-put by the reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh. You're not kidding."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's stare was straight ahead out the window, her fingers beginning to fidget in her lap, her lips turned down at the corners. As Rio looked over again, though, she saw something else. Something... mischievous.
    </p>
<p>
     "Estrella Liliana Vidal," Rio dared, stealing another glance while still trying to focus on driving. "What did you do?"
    </p>
<p>
     Estee glanced over at her from the corner of her eye and looked back down at something she was pulling up on her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     "She has an office in LA."
    </p>
<p>
     "Estee," Rio scoffed, rolling her eyes. "Stop it."
    </p>
<p>
     "There's something you're not telling me."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio's brow pulled tight. She had tried very hard not to lie to her child, and so there were times that she felt withholding the truth was the best option. Her personal life, the first one she'd had in two decades, was on that list.
    </p>
<p>
     "I found her earring. Hanging on the post by the dock." There was a tinge of defeat in Rio's tone. Clearly, it was something she hadn't stopped thinking about, something that was consuming her whole.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama..." Estee breathed, a light flickering in her eyes, although her mother was not looking at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "She just lost it. Someone found it, hung it on the post. It's really that simple." Even as she was speaking, she could literally hear the lack of conviction in her own voice. She wanted it to be for any other reason, wanted it to be a calling card, a lifeline. She knew that she had to remain realistic.
    </p>
<p>
     She was a tech developer who lived her life on a boat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness was Hollywood royalty.
    </p>
<p>
     For a day, they had been quite the pair, but it had never been destined to see another sunset.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can I ask you something? And I think that whatever the answer to this question is will answer whether or not you should go."
    </p>
<p>
     There was an entire mask of uncertainty that seemed to cross Rio's face as she understood the permission her daughter was seeking. She glanced over, that beautiful little face, and had a feeling that she was about to completely throttle her life view. She nodded, offering the acceptance she had been looking for.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did the earring have the back on it?"
    </p>
<p>
     It was stunning, the rate of speed at which realization slammed into her. Rio almost lost her breath, but instead, she forced herself to blink, to recall what that earring looked like in her palm, the small rubber backing around the curve.
    </p>
<p>
     She swallowed down the rock that had formed in her throat and gave a gentle nod.
    </p>
<p>
     "It did."
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't have to look over to know that Estee was wearing a very satisfied smirk. She knew that maybe her mother wasn't going to give in right away, but this realization? Well, it might give her a nudge in the right direction.
    </p>
<p>
     Damn it. Why did they have to have this conversation right before they spent another five weeks apart?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio parked and got out with her daughter, following her inside of the airport. She stood by as she watched her check in, not failing to somehow get the attendant to smile and even laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     That girl was a ray of light.
    </p>
<p>
     As she pulled away, Rio met her and nodded her head toward TSA. They walked and she could practically hear the gears turning in the girl's head. They reached the end of the line and Rio turned to her daughter, not hesitating to pull her into a warm and firm hug. She held her close, taking in the feel of her in her arms, the way her shampoo smelled. They were the little things she would hold onto in her absence, the things that would make her feel a little less lonely.
    </p>
<p>
     She relinquished her hold and stood back up to full height, looking down on her beautiful girl. She had almost started to raise her hand to touch her cheek, but Estee beat her to the punch, both of her palms coming up to cup Rio's cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Think about it. I can send you the address. But... I think she might want her earring back."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could feel the heat on her neck; she knew she really only had one choice, here.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll think about it, mija." She leaned forward and pressed her lips softly to Estrella's forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     The younger woman threw her arms around her mother's neck, squeezing her tight, so similar to how she had once done as a little girl.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Te amo, mama."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Te veo, mija."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     They separated and Rio gave her hand a soft squeeze, letting her hand go so that she could depart. Rio did not move, though, just watched as she went through security until she had walked out of sight, right before she glanced over her shoulder and offered her mother one last wave.
    </p>
<p>
     And there it went, the part of Rio that often kept her sane and rational.
    </p>
<p>
     The drive home was hard, and it was even harder returning back to her empty house after having her daughter's company for two weeks. She missed her sorely already, but her words were still ringing in Rio's head.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      I think you should go to America.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     America was a big place. A really fucking big place. Yes, she knew that Agatha was somewhere in LA, and she was even more acutely aware of the fact that Estrella had gone out of her way to track down where this woman's office was, but it was wild. It was unrealistic. It was stupid. There was absolutely zero sense in the idea of getting on a plane to California to, what? Show up at this office building and, as a literal no one, beg for a moment of this woman's attention? Telling anyone who she was would mean nothing -- Agatha did not even know her name.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been turning over the conversation, and over the message that had apparently been left for her. It was a screaming, waving attempt at saying
     <i>
      I was here! I didn't forget!
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Something about reflecting on it made Rio's middle molten hot, melting at the mere idea of seeing her again.
    </p>
<p>
     No, it was literally insane.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the stuff of movies.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't real life.
    </p>
<p>
     She set her keys down on the counter, sighing softly as a hand ran idly through her hair. Her eyes scanned over her apartment, tracing along the throngs of plants, vibrant and green in their nature.
    </p>
<p>
     And then it caught her eye. There, tucked among the leaves of a devil's ivy plant was a post-it note -- purple, per the ones Estee had picked out -- folded into a flower.
    </p>
<p>
     She was still for a long moment, staring hard as if it might disappear. She had watered those plants multiple times and somehow, she had missed it. In fact, it didn't even look like a drop of water had ever even touched it. She moved forward, reaching out with a feather light touch as she plucked it from between the leaves and pulled it close. Gently and carefully, she worked to unfold it, her heart thudding loudly between her ears.
    </p>
<p>
     What were the chances there was even anything inside?
    </p>
<p>
     It was flat beneath her palm, vibrating with all of the energy of potential, of what could have been, or maybe even what could be. She lifted her hand and glanced down at the piece of paper.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      What a soft place to land.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The scrawl was neat and tidy; it did not belong to her, and she knew for a fact it did not belong to Estee. Something in her chest caught, and for a moment, Rio forgot how to breathe. She had already been convinced that Agatha's presence would haunt her home for the foreseeable future, but she had not expected such a blatant show.
    </p>
<p>
     For as good as she had been doing about not devolving into the complete spiral that was that stupid night she had spent with Agatha Harkness, it was all suddenly out the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Estee was right.
    </p>
<p>
     But it was still completely idiotic, bordering on kamikaze... right?
    </p>
<p>
     She was no one, and she was going to come across as some insane stalker, begging for the attention of one of Hollywood's biggest names. She had just won a fucking Oscar for chrissakes. And what? She thought she would actually get anywhere by showing up?
    </p>
<p>
     She pushed a defeated sigh through her nose, turning to head toward her bedroom. She paced inside and toward the closet, thumbing through the clothes to decide what to pull on after her shower. She settled on an olive green t-shirt and a pair of comfortable beige sweatpants and headed into the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     While she had always preferred hot showers, the one she stepped into might have been too much for every day Rio. That day, though? She needed the heat, needed to feel that burn on her skin to force her into the mentality of making tough calls. She knew she was being a complete fool, but she couldn't stop thinking about it, especially after finding the note.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew it didn't technically mean anything, that it was probably just the musings of a grateful woman, but in the same turn of thought, she knew that thinking that way? Well, perhaps she was being more foolish than she had given herself credit for.
    </p>
<p>
     What reason on earth could she have had for doing it? And how had it turned up today, of all days?
    </p>
<p>
     She shut the shower off and stepped out, toweling down before she pulled on her clothes. She tried to float about her evening, tending to a meal, and trying to watch a movie, but her mind kept drifting. By the time she made her way to bed, her eyes fell on the side table, the purple square of paper still laying, message side up. She picked it up, looking down at it in the light. She glanced up at the ceiling, blinking back the emotion welling in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     She set the note down and turned off the light, lifting up her phone to unlock the screen as she climbed into bed. She stared at it for a long moment, something bubbling up in her chest. After minutes of hesitation, and several taps to keep the screen on her phone from falling asleep, she pulled up her travel app and began to search.
    </p>
<p>
     She spent a good thirty minutes finding the right flight, and a hotel that seemed like it would be nice enough if she ended up a) not finding her, or b) getting turned away. She booked without a return ticket; if this worked out, she had no clue how long she would want to stay and if it didn't? Well, she also had no clue how long she could stand to stay after that.
    </p>
<p>
     Her last step was booking the Uber to take her to the airport. She submitted and sat back, her eyes darting over the phone in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Was she really doing this?
    </p>
<p>
     She was really doing this.
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed her lips together and pulled up the contact list, dialing out to Estee. It rang only twice before Estee's tired voice came over the line.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama? Estas bien?" she murmured in that sleepy tone, like Rio had pulled her straight from a hard slumber.
    </p>
<p>
     "Si, si, mija. I... You were right. I'm going to go."
    </p>
<p>
     "What?" Estrella breathed, the disbelief nearly tangible in her tone of voice. Rio knew it would throw her, but she also figured she had a right to know.
    </p>
<p>
     "My uber picks me up at one and my flight leaves at three thirty tomorrow," she divulged softly. She knew she was being an idiot, but... something was pulling her. Something she could no longer ignore.
    </p>
<p>
     "What changed?" Estee asked in a soft murmur.
    </p>
<p>
     "She left me a flower."
    </p>
<p>
     "You found it, then?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio balked, stammering for a moment as she tried to catch up.
    </p>
<p>
     "You knew?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I found it on the floor this morning. I put it in the devil's ivy because I know it's your favorite." Estee paused for a moment, breathing a gentle sigh. "I'm glad you did."
    </p>
<p>
     "Me too, kid." Rio responded in a soft voice. She hesitated a moment, humming softly in thought. "I'll text you before takeoff, yeah? Get some sleep, mija."
    </p>
<p>
     "Mmmk mama. Te amo," she murmured, clearly giving in again to the pull of sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you too, roo," she breathed before the line clicked and she was left alone again.
    </p>
<p>
     Alone with the gravity of her decisions.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time the next afternoon rolled around, she stared at her phone, her eyes fixed on the cancel button on the Uber. Sure, she would lose out on the cost of the cancelled flight, but wouldn't it be better that way? Wouldn't it be better than completely embarrassing herself? This was a fool's errand, and she was flying thousands of miles to see it out. She was... completely out of her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     It was almost as if for the next fifteen hours, she completely blacked out. There were fleeting, flashing memories of the flight, of the layover. There were little blips, weaving in and out, but before she fully understood the depth of her journey, she was exiting the plane in the throes of LAX, her duffel bag slung over her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     It didn't seem real. Was she really there, in America? In California? In LA?
    </p>
<p>
     Was she really in the same city as Agatha Harkness?
    </p>
<p>
     As she pulled up her phone and ordered another Uber, she tried to map out a plan in her head. It was probably best to head to the hotel first, check in and gain her bearings. It couldn't be the worst idea to try and work through her nerves before she made the plunge into searching out someone who probably didn't even remember her.
    </p>
<p>
     So, she slid into the back of the car as it arrived and drove her to her destination. The hotel was beautiful; it was called The Freehand and the architecture, coupled with the art? It was a breathtaking sight, and she gave herself a mental pat on the back for having the sense to at least pick somewhere that was worth spending her time. The bar was a nice touch, too, and she was almost certain she would be spending some of her time there.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio Vidal in the big city. Wasn't this a fucking joke?
    </p>
<p>
     She had spent a few minutes in a text exchange with Estee, letting her know she had arrived safe and also informing her that she had no direct plan on how to tackle this.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Just show up. Wing it from there."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Sage advice from her twenty-one year old daughter, she supposed.
    </p>
<p>
     She had put her phone down and moved over to the window, taking in the sights of a brand new city, a brand new country. It truly was beautiful, in an incredibly different way than she was used to at home. She checked the time; it was edging on 1pm -- oof, that time change was already kicking her ass. Well, no better time than the present, right?
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled up the address on the screenshot Estee had sent her, punching it into the Uber app, requesting a car. She had paced, anxiously, as she waited for it to show up. She was so nervous, nearly crawling out of her skin. The same thoughts kept repeating: What are you doing? Are you insane? This is awful. What are you thinking?
    </p>
<p>
     The car pulled up in front of the towering office building, the glass sheeting up the sides in a shimmering display of power, of money, of status.
    </p>
<p>
     The hammering of Rio's heart? It was a complete thunderstorm in her ears, a rapid repetition of crashing and thumping. This was never going to work.
    </p>
<p>
     This was a suicide mission.
    </p>
<p>
     She climbed out of the car and bravely found her feet carrying herself up the concrete steps that led to the walkway of the building. She had thought this through up until the point she crossed the threshold into that building.
    </p>
<p>
     The next forty minutes, she had been tasked with trying to barter with security, though every single attempt was futile. They asked her name, and she had given it willingly, but she knew it wouldn't matter. Agatha didn't know her like that. She knew that if she pushed any harder, security's next call was likely going to be to the police. He had let slip, at one point, that she wasn't in, but Rio had taken it as something said to deflect from her persistence.
    </p>
<p>
     Honestly, as she finally realized she would not be getting on that elevator, she heaved a soft and deflated sigh, asking instead for a piece of paper. She scribbled down her name, her phone number, and drew a small boat on jagged waves. Maybe, just maybe, that might be enough.
    </p>
<p>
     The doubt in her was strong, though, as she handed the paper over to the security guard who was still looking at her like she was entirely out of her mind. She knew what this looked like, and she knew that he had been of half a mind to start the process for a restraining order, but she'd had her hopes. She had wanted so badly for this idea that her life could be a real life fucking fairy tale to be real, to be tangible, to be hers. What she was realizing, as she turned around and tucked her chin to walk through those glass doors, was that any kind of a happy ending? When it came to her, it was reserved for the tales she had told her daughter as a child, and nothing more.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a sense of shame; no one really knew her, or why she was there, or why she had spent so long trying to strike some kind of deal with security that might afford her even a moment of Agatha's time, but it felt like they did. In the end, none of it really mattered, and yet? Rio's pride felt like it had been put through a gravel crusher.
    </p>
<p>
     Her mind was turning circles over what she was going to do. She supposed that it wouldn't be a terrible idea of spend some time in the city, to see the sights and experience things that she might not otherwise get to see or experience. She was in one of the biggest, busiest cities in the world. Surely, she could find something to do, some way to fill her time. She still couldn't help but feel the sting of disappointment; none of those things would ever measure up to what could have happened if she had managed to find Agatha again.
    </p>
<p>
     Her feet shuffled gently, scuffing softly over the concrete as she made her way back toward the stairs, the loneliness entwining itself around her, from head to toe. She reached the top of the stairs and lifted her head, an exhaled sigh catching mid breath.
    </p>
<p>
     There, at the bottom of the stairs, stood two women. There was a thin woman with long scarlet hair that cascaded over her shoulders, and then there was a woman next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Not just
     <i>
      a
     </i>
     woman.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      The
     </i>
     woman.
    </p>
<p>
     She was gripping onto her friend's arm, their eyes still locked across the expanse of the stairs. They were there, frozen in time, just scrambling to integrate what they were seeing into being reality.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, in sync, there was movement.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's feet began to move, carrying her down the stairs on the tips of her toes, the rubber of her combat boots scraping the concrete with how quickly she was moving. At the same time, Agatha was rushing forward, headed straight for the bottom of the stairs. The distance had been of almost equal measure, and as both of Rio's feet flattened on solid ground, she hardly had time to ground herself before they met.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's body bumped into hers as Rio felt her hands on her face, that touch, that caress, that captivating hold that commanded her attention. She could hardly even begin to process what was going on, and did not have a moment to think of anything to say before Agatha's lips were on her own, a hot and sultry kiss, passionate in its fair measure.
    </p>
<p>
     The way Agatha kissed her like that? She didn't need to breathe. Oxygen was irrelevant. All she needed in that moment was to keep kissing Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Then -- like a flash -- the bright realization of their setting and location sparked her to open her eyes, pulling back, though she didn't go far.
    </p>
<p>
     The smile on Rio's face was warm and instant, but before her brain could even adjust enough to form words, Agatha was speaking.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hi. I'm Agatha. What might your name be?"
     </i>
     The words were a soft brush, a sweet song to Rio's ears. They made her stomach twist in sheer delight, that familiar pink heat rising to her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's smile only seemed to grow, her dark eyes just searching over the woman's face, taking in every freckle, every crease, every divot and dimple. She wanted to commit this memory to an eternity, something she would always and forever have to hold on to.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "My name's Rio."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed, and the sound of her name on the other woman's lips had her heart leaping straight up into her throat. It was so beautiful, so elegant when it rolled off of her tongue.
     <i>
      "It's nice to meet you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The heat Rio was feeling in the pit of her being had to be showing, had to be obvious to anyone looking at her. There was no possible way in any existence that this was actually happening, that she was standing there with her hands on the hips of Agatha Harkness at the foot of her building. There was no way that Agatha had run up to her like that, held onto her like precious materials, and had kissed her in front of every single passerby that was on that block.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha placed a gentle hand to Rio's chest, their eyes meeting. Gods, those blues were even more enchanting from such a close view.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have so many questions," she murmured across the space at Rio, though there was a consistent and bright light that was shimmering in her gaze. "But first..." she managed, sliding to the side to face the woman she had abandoned closer to the street. As she turned, though, she seemed to slide right into Rio's side, like she had always belonged there. One arm slid around the small of Rio's back, and the other resumed its home on her chest, dead center.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio, this is my best friend, Wanda. Wanda this is... Rio, apparently. Otherwise known as 'boat woman.'"
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio's eyebrows shot up in surprise, and honestly, a touch of amusement, too.
    </p>
<p>
     "'Boat woman?'" She echoed, her gaze flickering up to Agatha, an undeniable smirk tugging on the corners of her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean. So maybe I've talked about you. A little bit." That almost would have been believable if her friend had not laughed the way she had, causing Rio's smirk to grow even more.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's gaze flickered down to the woman at her side, her stare light and full of amazement. She leaned a little closer, her voice dropping to that velvet smooth croon that she had used only once in their time together.
    </p>
<p>
     "I take it you found my message?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's skin sheeted in goosebumps, the thudding of her heart increasing at the proximity. She gulped down a breath, trying to keep her head steady. She nodded, her fingers dipping into her pocket to produce the earring. She held it up for show, letting it dangle from her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     The other woman's eyes were so bright in that moment that it made Rio swoon there against her side.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tapped Rio's chest softly with the tips of her fingers, her attention sweeping back to Wanda, an apologetic look crossing over those gorgeous features.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know we just made plans for the evening, but would you be super upset if I call for a rain check?" Agatha posed, a bit of honey laced through her words.
    </p>
<p>
     The other woman rolled her eyes. "I would be disappointed if you didn't."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thanked her and they exchanged a brief hug before Wanda departed, and the full weight of Agatha's attention suddenly settled on Rio, those beautiful blue eyes taking her in, mystified. Perhaps Agatha was of the same mind, here, that this felt far more surreal than either of them knew how to wrap their minds around.
    </p>
<p>
     "I need to grab my bag and coat from my office. If you'd like to join me, we can figure out what to do with the rest of our night."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's smile had hardly left her face from the moment their lips had pulled apart. She had wanted it to last longer, but she suddenly had a promise hanging in front of her that there would be plenty more time for that, that it might become something she would get to do at her leisure, and the thought alone was enough to excite her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Lead the way, my lady," Rio teased softly, flourishing a hand for Agatha to lead the way. What she had not been expecting was that, as she walked by, Agatha took hold of her hand and pulled her along, not letting go. In fact, she gave it a soft squeeze as they entered the building.
    </p>
<p>
     If Rio would have had a camera? She absolutely would have snapped a photo of the expression that crossed the face of the security guard at the front desk as the two women crossed the floor, hand in hand. Rio couldn't help the satisfied smirk that filled her face, an air of confidence beginning to exude from her form.
    </p>
<p>
     The elevators were absolutely pristine, and as the door shut behind them, she felt it again -- that gentle squeeze. Her head turned and her chin tilted up slightly, her eyes meeting Agatha's across the couple of inches between them.
    </p>
<p>
     There was this strong, silent exchange between them. There was this urge inside of Rio to grab her up by the face, to crush their lips together until neither of them could breathe anymore and had to separate only to gasp for air. She, somehow, found restraint. Where it came from, she had no idea, but she never once let go of her hand, even as the elevator slowed to a stop, the doors sliding open.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled her into the large and spacious office. She tugged her along to a back corner, pulling her through the doorway to an open space decorated in minimalist furniture and floor to ceiling windows that seemed to illuminate the entire space. It was beautiful, really, and Rio was struck with an overwhelming sense of awe.
    </p>
<p>
     "Give me one second," Agatha requested, but Rio was enchanted by the view, which she stepped closer to so that she could get a better vantage point.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a disbelief in her eyes, a wonder that was beyond linguistic expression.
    </p>
<p>
     "You've never seen anything like this?" came Agatha's soft, rich tones, quiet but close.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio started to shake her head, she felt an arm encircle her waist, pulling her back, holding her firmly. Being held by Agatha? That was actually happening? The other woman's chin rested on Rio's shoulder, their gazes casting out on the city evenly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, I suppose we might have quite a bit of exploring to do in your time here," Agatha suggested in a warm but smooth murmur, and Rio glanced down, lifting an arm to lay it atop Agatha's. She could tell, by the brief squeeze around her waist, that the delivery there was more than intended as a double entendre, and by no means did that perturb her in any way.
    </p>
<p>
     Her reply was smooth and rich, not missing a beat.
    </p>
<p>
     "I suppose we do."

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     The view outside of that high rise window had been one thing, but turning around in Agatha's grip to take her in, really take her in?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Gods. Be. Damned.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Everything about her was... perfect for what Rio knew of her as a person, thus far. Granted, there was a plethora left to learn about her, a great deal of knowledge to catalog and store away for future use. What she did know, though? Agatha wore every bit of who she was through what she looked like. It wasn't even that it was just how beautiful was; Rio saw that air again, the one that swirled around her, confident and proud. Her posture carried her authority, no matter what space she was walking in to command.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew who she was to the world and she wore it like a cape, like it gave her the power to take on the universe.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      She was her own god.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That conversation flashed, quick as a blink, and a gentle fondness filled Rio for a brief moment, and then, she was back to the task at hand: Her first lesson in Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     They were close, Agatha's arms snugly wrapped around the small of her back, holding her close enough that the fronts of their bodies were touching, just barely, but enough to really constitute contact. Just that little touch, it was enough to have every inch of Rio's skin searing with a burning heat that she was convinced could not be cooled. Those dark eyes took her in at that close proximity, her mind racing a million miles a minute.
    </p>
<p>
     How in the Hell was she right there, in that huge fucking building, standing damn near forehead-to-forehead with an acclaimed director? How in the hell had this become her life in the matter of a month? How had life gotten that far away from her?
    </p>
<p>
     Was it that it had gotten away, or was it more that she had watched it go, only to decide that the risk of chasing it and getting lost was worth the reward of finding it?
    </p>
<p>
     It would have been like pulling teeth to get her to admit it, but Rio knew it leaned toward the latter.
    </p>
<p>
     There was such a sense of reverence as her eyes traced every inch of the other woman's features, from the gentle slope of her nose to the light curve of her thin lips. Those blue eyes? Gods, those blue eyes were absolutely to die for, especially when soaked in the look they were wearing in that moment, that utter adoration practically bleeding out of them.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm free for the rest of the evening, so what we do is totally up to you," Agatha spoke, finally shattering the charged silence that had settled around them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes danced with light as they darted again, her lips curving up slightly as she thought. While she did have an actual agenda, she couldn't pass up the blatant opportunity to give Agatha a bit of a hard time. After all, she'd flown six and a half thousand miles. Hadn't she earned the right to razz her up a bit?
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't even have to ask?" Rio posed, and a flash of confusion crossed Agatha's expression. "I mean, not to toot my own horn, but you agreeing to a date without me having to ask? I must have some serious game."
    </p>
<p>
     Her grin was automatic, canvassing her entire face, even reaching up as far as to crinkle her eyes at the corners, the pure joy painting itself over every crevice of her features. Seeing that Agatha's expression rivaled her own? It sent a pulse of warmth through every extremity she had, surely touching her neck with that pink dusting, though she didn't much care anymore if Agatha bore witness to it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, didn't we sort of already have one of those?" Agatha asked, a brightness flickering there that nearly made Rio melt.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean..." Rio began, her lips dropping just barely into something that was a version of a softer, gentler smile. "There
     <i>
      were
     </i>
     candles?"
    </p>
<p>
     The laughter was immediate between the two of them, and for a second, Rio was pretty sure that her feet left the ground, that she had started to float toward the ceiling before the sound of Agatha's voice grounded her again.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... what do you think?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pondered a moment, the thoughts buzzing around behind dark irises. "We could go back to where I'm staying. There's a really nice bar on the ground floor."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tutted her tongue, a sly smirk finding her face. "Tsk, tsk, tsk. Always so insistent on plying me with alcohol. My mistake, though. I should have offered to buy you dinner first."
    </p>
<p>
     The wink that she tacked on at the end of her sentence? I could have just about ended her, full stop. It had been literally decades since she had been paid this kind of attention by literally anyone. She was even pretty damn amazed with the fact that she seemed to be keeping up with this woman. She would have laughed if someone had looked her in the eyes and told her she would be flirting with someone when she was nearly forty years old. The thought would have been downright hysterical.
    </p>
<p>
     But, there she was, holding her own.
    </p>
<p>
     "You can make it up to me with the best take out that you try to keep a secret from anyone else. And if you really feel
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     bad, you can pick up the tab, too."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha's brow quirked, and if Rio didn't know any better, she could have sworn that she heard her breath catch, for just the briefest second. She was not usually one to be so bold, at all, but there was something about the comfort in Agatha's aura that seemed to lend a hand to nearly yanking her out of the shell she had confined herself to for so long.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hm," Agatha murmured, her gaze intense as she seemed to regard Rio. Rio was focused on those eyes, on what was brewing in them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes?" she posed, as if to prod her into answering.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, nothing," Agatha dismissed, though her scrutinizing gaze had not let up in the least.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Rio pushed, tilting her head forward with an encouraging smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean, I guess it's just that I misjudged you."
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh?" This intrigued Rio; she had thought that she had been pretty transparent in their first meeting, at least in regards to everything that came up between them. Sure, there were pages of history yet left for them to learn, but she could not deduce what Agatha could possibly be talking about.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a curt nod, that intense stare boring right through Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "I just assumed you didn't have a bossy bone in your body." Her voice had dropped, it was textured and smooth, but there was a husky edge to it that Rio could not willingly ignore. Instead, another pulse of heat reverberated inside of her, but this time it was contained to her middle, white hot.
    </p>
<p>
     "I may just surprise you yet," Rio murmured back, her own voice slightly haughty, though for a moment she almost laughed at herself at the attempt to be sexy, alluring. Was it even succeeding? Well, only time would tell.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's focus shifted, having held her stare for so long, down to Rio's lips. They lingered for a solid moment before they raised again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn't control it, the look of amusement that had crept over her features.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's gaze was unrelenting, looking straight into the depths of her very essence, but Rio didn't waver, didn't hesitate to feed it right back.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You make it really hard to not want to kiss you,"
     </i>
     Agatha told her, her voice hardly more than a coarse whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     Instantly, Rio was set alight. She might as well have literally been on fire, because the heat that consumed her was instant, causing beads of sweat to spawn on the back of her neck, her temples. A spike of boldness flared through her, her voice coming out far stronger than she had thought it might, though her tones were still hushed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So what's stopping you?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could see clear as day, the way the giddiness nearly smothered Agatha for a split second at the permission she had offered to her.
    </p>
<p>
     What threw Rio off was that with that permission? It wasn't an immediate response. Agatha was still looking at her, watching her with this hot intensity that felt scorching, a daring tug pulling at her lips to reveal those perfect teeth in a full smile.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Agatha's hand raised, landing on Rio's shoulder, and the simple touch seemed to send a current straight to her chest, stopping her heart for a beat before kicking it back on again. And then, it moved. It was a firm pressure, an announcement that she was there, that she was right there, that Rio could really feel it. It was there for her to take in, to absorb, to devour. It slid up the crook of her neck, over the side of it as Agatha's thin fingers curled around the back. It slipped up higher, Agatha's hand easily finding a gentle grip in Rio's hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Their eyes had not left one another's stare, despite the fact that Rio knew for a fact she had crossed every bit of the color spectrum from pink to red to scarlet, finally landing at a bright crimson.
    </p>
<p>
     If Agatha was trying to make her want this so bad it fucking hurt, it was working.
    </p>
<p>
     Her heart was a steady drumline in her chest, ricocheting off the prison of her ribcage, just seeking the freedom it needed to beat, to thrum, to pound however hard it needed to without being controlled.
    </p>
<p>
     If she had been convinced that it wasn't going to get any better than that moment, what followed had been sure to blow her away. She had in no way been expecting Agatha's words, and it showed the moment they graced her ears.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I have thought about you every single day, and every single night since I walked out your door. I've thought about doing this twice as much."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had been quite certain that as the words processed, every bit of oxygen had been pulled out of her. It was damn near a known fact in that moment, but then? When Agatha finally dared to eliminate the space that had been like a solid wall between them, every bit of that heat ruminating in Rio's middle?
    </p>
<p>
     Their lips crushed together, mild at first, as if Agatha was gauging what level of heat Rio might find acceptable. It took only a moment for Rio to push back, to escalate it up another step.
    </p>
<p>
     She was convinced that breathing? It was unnecessary, something that had been a trick, a brainwashing of the masses.
    </p>
<p>
     Who needed to breathe when they could be kissed like
     <i>
      that?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     For as many times as Rio had told herself that she wouldn't know how to kiss someone even if she had to? Something primal, instinctual seemed to possess her. She fed right back into the exchange, her own hands gripping lightly at Agatha's sides, pulling her closer, their fronts flushed together.
    </p>
<p>
     There was only a mild sense of shock that struck Rio as she felt the tip of Agatha's tongue tracing lightly along the bottom of her top lip.
    </p>
<p>
     What pulled her attention instead was the bolt of lightning that shot straight up her spine, searing itself with scorching tendrils across every inch of her brain.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Gods, that was fucking hot.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She understood it for what it was, though. It was a tap on the barrier, a request for entrance. Agatha wanted in, and Rio was all but ready to kick the door down.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips parted and there was not even a split second of hesitance from the other woman as Rio felt their tongues meet, brushing, pushing, caressing. If she was a terrible kisser? Well, there had been no objections thus far, and she was inwardly begging the universe to just give her this, for as long as she could have it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grip tightened at the base of her skull and she could feel her pulling her closer, needing more, wanting more, taking more. And Rio was happy to give.
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn't have said how long they stood like that, gripping, grasping, sighing, gasping, but what she could have said was that by the time they parted, their pants and heavy breaths echoing off of the walls around them?
    </p>
<p>
     She knew she was never going to be able to get her fill of Agatha Harkness. Ever.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What do you say we go back to the hotel?"
     </i>
     Rio posed, the gentle caress of her stare sweeping over Agatha in question.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll call the car," she murmured. Before she loosened her hold, though, she dipped her head, stealing the briefest of pecks right off of an unsuspecting Rio's lips, leaving her gaping slightly in wonder. How the fuck did she do that? Where did this power come from? Where had she found this presence that she wore so proudly like battle armor?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was sold. Whatever it was Agatha was selling? Rio was investing everything she had in it.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew there was risk. She knew that they could spend two days together and realize that they hated each other. Right then, standing in that office as she turned to watch Agatha's form as she paced behind her desk on the phone, gathering her things? She didn't care. Every chip was on the table, a go-big-or-go-broke mentality finally having settled over her.
    </p>
<p>
     There was not much in life that Rio had ever really chased after. She'd found that she'd had everything she needed, in her career, and in her role as a mother. She'd been totally and utterly convinced that she lived a life that was full enough, and that she did not need to seek out anything else -- like a relationship -- to 'fix' any part of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Her loneliness had been so severe, though, that it had needed repairing.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Maybe,
     </i>
     she thought,
     <i>
      Agatha could be good with her hands.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There was the tiniest twitch of her lips, a barely-there smirk that she was glad Agatha could not see. She was getting ahead of herself, of course, and she was well aware, but that didn't mean she wanted to stop. Of course, she was not going to take her back to her hotel room and throw her down only to rip her clothes off, but she was not going to offer any sort of objection to any natural progression the night might have chosen to take.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha folded her coat over her arm, holding her purse in the same hand as she turned back to face Rio; out of the corner of Rio's eye, she could see the woman pause, for just a moment. She could feel that heat again, the scrutiny of her gaze, the way she was eating up everything she could glean from that vantage point.
    </p>
<p>
     She lifted her head, turning to meet Agatha's gaze across the room, an instant smile blossoming across her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Shall we?" Agatha offered as she stepped forward, holding out a hand as if it were the most natural thing in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced at it for only a moment before accepting the invitation, their palms clasping together as Agatha led her back toward the elevator and out the building.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had not held hands with another being that was not her own offspring in... well, almost ever. Her early college days had been mostly flings, not ever reaching any form of establishment when it came to a relationship. She had still been trying to figure herself out, but that ability for exploration had been seized from her before she'd had a chance to do anything with it.
    </p>
<p>
     But the way that Agatha seemed to refuse to let her go? The way she seemed to cling to the contact like it was some kind of lifeline? Rio had been completely bombarded with every emotion that could possibly be named since she had landed on American soil, but there was something special about what was flickering to life inside of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt
     <i>
      wanted.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The touch only dissipated twice in the journey from Agatha's office to the hotel, and it was the two times they had to break apart to get in and out of the car. The contact was never initiated by Rio, always Agatha. She was making a very clear, very bold statement, one that left Rio feeling eternally flushed:
     <i>
      This moment is ours, but I need the world to see that you are mine.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     They probably looked like a pair of teenage girls as the poured into the lobby of the hotel, the way they were so close and faces filled with amusement, light, happiness. It was a new outfit to wear for Rio, but she was quite liking the work out the muscles in her face were getting; they had been idle and unused in this manner for far too long.
    </p>
<p>
     The wind seemed to carry them, even in an enclosed lobby, as they made their way over to the bar that was located in the heart of the hotel.
    </p>
<p>
     They slid onto stools at the smooth cherry bar top and Agatha pulled her black credit card out, pinning it at the corners between her thumb and the pad of her middle finger, spinning it mindlessly as the bartender, a younger man with dark skin and bright eyes, approached them.
    </p>
<p>
     Everything about Agatha was so... effortless.
    </p>
<p>
     "A martini, dry with two extra olives and..." Those blue hues sliced over to Rio, regarding her, studying her, trying to deduce something. Rio had almost thought that Agatha had paused to allow her to answer, but it only took a moment for her to understand that she was playing a game. She wanted to know if she could guess.
    </p>
<p>
     She could see the question there, watching with earned interest as Agatha tried to land on the right answer. She faltered for a moment, and when she turned back to the bartender, she had thought that she might at least pose her deduction as a question.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no question in Agatha's addition to the order.
    </p>
<p>
     "A sidecar."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio balked; how the fuck had she known that? She blinked, though Agatha's profile remained completely cool and collected. She hadn't even glanced over to see if she was right. She had taken Rio's silence as a quiet victory, and Rio could tell by the way the corner of her mouth hitched up despite her eyes not leaving the bartender as he went about making their drinks.
    </p>
<p>
     "How do you do that?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand brushed beneath her chin and she glanced over at Rio with a feigned sense of shock. "Do what?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips pursed in amused dissatisfaction and she cocked a brow at her, tilting her head as if to say
     <i>
      You know what.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "Guess you'll have to stick around long enough to find out."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had begun to dispute, but she was interrupted by the man behind the bar as he turned around and slid their drinks in front of them. Agatha pressed the black plastic to the bar top and slid it over to him.
    </p>
<p>
     "Leave it open."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio studied her, an amused dance of expression flickering across her face
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, okay, Mommy Warbucks."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha's searing gaze sliced over to Rio, that sense of being transparent washing over all over again. It was solid and steady, assessing everything it saw, piecing together how she best wanted to respond. It could have been an illusion, but Rio could have sworn that she saw a lick of rose curl its way up Agatha's neck, but it seemed to fade just as fast.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Okay. So that had pressed a button.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes were smoldering for a passing moment, and then, just like that, she extinguished the fire, though Rio could still see the remaining coals there, fighting for enough oxygen to keep burning. It wasn't an angry look, it was something else. It was
     <i>
      attraction.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That stare, it was unrelenting, heavy in its weight, but only because Rio was learning that Agatha's silence often meant she had time to think, and when Agatha gave herself time to think? She could be damaging.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't want to forfeit the upper hand quite yet, though.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can I ask you something?" she posed, neglecting the drink that Agatha had just ordered for her to instead quench the thirst of her curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression softened as she considered, giving her a gentle nod of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     "When did you come back?"
    </p>
<p>
     The look in her eyes? Rio hardly knew how to make sense of it's tenderness, but she hardly had time to ponder it before she was pulled into the answer Agatha had to offer.
    </p>
<p>
     "The day I came back here. It was just after noon. You weren't home and I... I panicked. I didn't have anything on me, like a card, or even paper to write you a note. So I left the one thing I did have on me. It seems as though it got the job done."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's cheeks were suddenly hot and her eyes dropped to her lap, though there was a small smile still on her face. She lifted her head again, looking across at Agatha a bit earnestly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Honestly? I put it in my jewelry box with every intent of ignoring it. I... I thought you just lost it. However, after I realized who you are when we watched the Oscars, I told my daughter, and she was pretty insistent that I get on a plane and fly six thousand miles and find you after pointing out that you had left the back on it intentionally."
    </p>
<p>
     A soft hum of approval escaped Agatha's lips, which were twisted up in a grin, the softest huff of humor accompanying it a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
     "Smart girl."
    </p>
<p>
     She swiped her martini off of the bar top and swiveled in her seat, her knees nearly pressing into the side of Rio's thigh. She held the glass up, tilting her head to the side as she took in the sight of the other woman.
    </p>
<p>
     "What's her name?" Agatha asked, her tone tender, sweet.
    </p>
<p>
     "Estrella."
    </p>
<p>
     "Well then," Agatha announced, pushing the glass forward. "To Estrella."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it, this nestling of affection in her chest. How sweet was it that, as they shared their first toast on American soil, Agatha thought it deserved to belong to the one person who had pushed this to happen?
    </p>
<p>
     "To Estrella," she echoed, lifting her own glass to touch the rim of it to Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been the first toast, but it hadn't been the last. Or the second, third, or forth.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did not get drunk. It just wasn't something she did. However, right then? Well, she was pretty damn close to toeing the line.
    </p>
<p>
     They had been at that bar, just sipping their drinks, sharing soft conversation back and forth, finding some way to make small talk not seem so awkward. Rio had learned a lot in that couple of hours; Agatha had been in Auckland on business, that much had been true. In fact, she had even been at the wildlands the day before, doing a scouting for a filming location. She was still in the beginning stages of finding the legs for the project she was working on, but she had been growing more confident that she was coming close to settling on a location. She learned that Agatha's favorite flowers were azaleas, she hated dark chocolate, and she had a pretty intense allergy to cinnamon. Her favorite time of day was dusk, the most breathtaking place she had been for work had been Iceland, and her favorite holiday season was Christmas, solely for the spiked eggnog.
    </p>
<p>
     This woman wasn't just a book to be cracked open and read. She was an entire series, a multitude of standalone stories that, when put together, were an intricate and detailed showing of a completely and entirely complex woman.
    </p>
<p>
     She was full of content, filled with endless tales of sage wisdom and surely, tales of light and humor and life. Rio couldn't wait to absorb every single chapter.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had flagged down the bartender with an assured flick of her wrist, and he answered her call, appearing before them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Close me out," she instructed, "but before you do... could you add a bottle of the Remy Martin for room..." she trailed, glancing over at Rio, who seemed to catch on quick.
    </p>
<p>
     "2315."
    </p>
<p>
     "To room 2315."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, ma'am," he agreed with a nod. He turned to his work, finalizing the tab and placing the order for the bottle to be delivered up to Rio's room. He slid the check across the bar and Agatha signed it easily after adding a tip that Rio couldn't help but notice -- $150 -- and slid it back over to him. He thanked her with a grateful nod and took his leave.
    </p>
<p>
     Her face turned back to Agatha, drinking her in like a tall glass of water after a week in the desert.
    </p>
<p>
     "We should probably beat them up there, hm?" Agatha posed, the traces of a giggle lingering on her lips, though they never formed fully.
    </p>
<p>
     The light danced in Rio's face as she gave a nod, sliding off the stool to get back on her feet. When they said that it was impossible to gauge how drunk one was until they stood up? She knew exactly what that meant in that moment. She swayed, just barely, but kept herself steady, though she did not miss the way Agatha's hand flew up, hovering just outside of the side of her arm, though it never made contact.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had not even had time to consider where the elevator was before she felt Agatha's fingers slide between her own and she gave a light tug, seeming to know where she was going. Rio should have taken charge, should have acted like she had some semblance of control here, but there was something so... enticing about watching this woman brandish her confidence like a weapon, daring anyone to stand in her way.
    </p>
<p>
     They slipped into the elevator, devolving into a flurry of giggles as the door clipped Rio's heel on the way in as it started to close.
    </p>
<p>
     The way they laughed, the pure delight that shook them left them leaning into one another, holding onto each other. The calm started to come and the laughter began to die down, but they were so close that Rio could smell the gin on Agatha's breath mixing with the brandy on her own. Their eyes caught and after another beat, the laughter subsided.
    </p>
<p>
     They were there, locked in that battle of wills, each of them silently daring the other to be the one to jump, to careen over the edge of sanity and pull the other with them.
    </p>
<p>
     After only another moment, Rio broke. Her hand was up, firm against the side of Agatha's neck as she pulled her in, her mouth finding Agatha's with an astonishing ease. Their lips met in a crush of heat and desperation. This was something Rio could have done over and over again until she either suffocated, or the rest of the world melted away around them. Either was an option she was fine with.
    </p>
<p>
     For their setting and the fact that their inevitable destination was not that far away, that kiss seemed to spark a fire that spread in the blink of an eye. By the time the door dinged and slid open, Rio was far too engrossed with the way her tongue probed Agatha's mouth, wild and exploratory in nature to pay any attention. The door closed again, but with no destination, the elevator just sat.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio? Oblivious. She needed that, the taste of gin and vermouth on those lips, on that tongue. She needed the scent of palo santo and lilac that filled her senses from Agatha's perfume. She needed the feel of that silk blouse beneath her fingertips, smooth and rich at her touch.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, Agatha pulled away, her chest heaving a bit with the effort.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Erm. I think we've arrived,"
     </i>
     she indicated, a pointed finger gesturing to the stilled number above the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Instantly, they devolved into a fit of giggles, Rio leaning over to press the 'door open' button. The laughter was still bubbling out of her as they stumbled out of the elevator, never even an inch apart. As they neared her room, there was a sharply dressed man in uniform standing by her door, the bottle Agatha had requested in the palm of his hand, resting against his forearm.
    </p>
<p>
     As they approached, Agatha pulled something out of her wallet and tucked it back in her bag. She approached the man and made the exchange, sliding the hundred into his palm the moment she removed the bottle from it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ma'am," he acknowledged gratefully before he turned and made his exit.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned on her heel forty-five degrees to face Rio, a pleased smile on her lips. Her free hand gave a wave toward the door and Rio nodded, stepping forward to slide the key into the lock. The light flashed green and she pushed the door open, holding it while Agatha entered.
    </p>
<p>
     She let it close with a soft
     <i>
      click
     </i>
     and turned back to face the room, watching with interest as Agatha set the bottle down, slipped her shoes off and draped her coat over the back of the desk chair.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped further into the room, but her eyes never left Agatha. She moved with such a fluidity as she reached up, removing the clip from her hair. She shook it loose as it cascaded down her back in those flowing soft waves. She moved again, and even though her back was to Rio, Rio knew exactly what she was doing, only being proven right as Agatha turned around, the top two buttons of her blouse undone.
    </p>
<p>
     This woman was going to be the end of her, if she let her.
    </p>
<p>
     It was looking like a pretty feasible option from where she stood.

       What if we get to the sky and this was all a lie
       <br/>
       This was all a dream?

</p>
<p>
<i>
       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     In the hours that had passed as the two women had perched at that bar, the alcohol sliding down with ease and the banter free flowing, the world outside had grown dark. Not only had the sun started its descent in the sky, but thick shelves of dark clouds had rolled in.
    </p>
<p>
     The thunder was not loud enough to shake the center of the hotel, but in that room, its soft rumble could be heard outside of the window. The pelting of raindrops was soundless, but they collected on the glass, pooling in tiny spots that distorted the view ahead at the right angle. There could have been tornadoes, there could have been a tsunami, and Rio wouldn't have known.
    </p>
<p>
     Moreover, she wasn't sure she would have cared.
    </p>
<p>
     The tangible interest was still hanging thick in the air as Rio and Agatha both settled on the soft, plush bed that was stationed in the middle of the room, a little square of privacy that might offer them the space to explore, to learn, to understand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand swept over, gently laying the bottle of brandy in the small amount of space between them. Did Rio need it? Probably not, but it was a fun little temptation, a little reminder that she could lose herself a bit further in the warmth the liquor had to offer. She knew she didn't really need it -- the heat that had been smoldering within her since the moment she had arrived had not died down for even a second. But it was there if she wanted it.
    </p>
<p>
     Once again, as if she could not stand the thought of a bare palm, Agatha lifted a hand and reached over, securing Rio's snugly in her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips were parting and she was speaking before she had formed even a thought.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why do you do that?" she asked, though there was a tender curiosity laced in her voice. Her hand gave a light squeeze as if to indicate what she was referring to.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned her head toward her, leaving Rio to be met with an assessment, an evaluation of everything she was in that particular moment under steeled but warm eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because it's a constant reminder that the day we spent together wasn't a complete dream."
    </p>
<p>
     If Rio had been standing? She probably would have crumbled, her knees turned to absolute jelly. She had been feeling much the same way; every time they kissed, she was jolted into reality, into her reality, where chasing the things she wanted had, for once, turned out in her favor. She had intended on letting the weight sink over her, but Agatha spoke again.
    </p>
<p>
     "And because I can't kiss you constantly to hold firm in that assessment instead."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio flushed, an undeniable blushing that seemed to coat her from head to toe. This woman... This woman was absolutely something else.
    </p>
<p>
     "And while I would love to indulge in that within the privacy of these walls... My interest in getting to know you is a little heavier."
    </p>
<p>
     Still warm, Rio's eyes cast down to their hands, clasped together in a strong grip. She considered for a short moment before she looked back up at the other woman.
    </p>
<p>
     "What would you like to know?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes darted, ever so slightly, as they surveyed Rio's face, as if she were going to find the questions she wanted to ask there. Something about the way the moment drew on, about the intensity of that prying gaze, it started to unsettle Rio the slightest bit. She could sense it cooking, brewing; it was a desire for knowledge that wasn't quite so common.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave the smallest nod, a silent encouragement, a light push to get her to keep going.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is..." Agatha's lips twisted slightly in discomfort; she looked like she knew she had no right to be asking the question she was about to ask. "Is Estrella's father in the picture?"
    </p>
<p>
     At this, there was a sudden squeeze, a tightening in Rio's throat that nearly choked her.
    </p>
<p>
     This was a conversation that had taken her eighteen years to have with the only person she had thought deserved to know. It was something she was still wounded from, even if the pain it caused was nothing more than a minor sting after so long.
    </p>
<p>
     She could have lied. She could have made up some story about a college tryst gone wrong, or that she had made bad choices in her youth. She could have said anything other than the actual truth, but then... What would be the point? This woman was clearly interested in her, clearly wanted to get to know her. Neither of them had any clue if this would amount to anything after this trip, but to lie?
    </p>
<p>
     It wouldn't be productive, wouldn't lend to establishing any form of trust between them. Her eyes fell again on their hands, her thumb brushing over the back of Agatha's knuckles nervously. While she knew that the silence while she tried to decide on her delivery of a rather fucked fact of life was extensive, Agatha was patient, her hold firm on Rio's hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "I was in my second year of uni. I went with a couple of friends to a house party one night." Her voice had the lightest hint of a waver in it. It was the first time she had ever actually recounted what happened that night without censoring herself to protect Estee. "One of them wanted to show me something, a record collection, I think, and so I followed her, leaving my drink on the kitchen counter." There was the most subtle drop in Agatha's expression, as if she could already see where this was going. "I came back, as if nothing could have changed in those two minutes. The rest of the night... it was a blur."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled the smallest sigh, as if she were
     <i>
      ashamed.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "I woke up the next morning in a dorm room I didn't know, next to an older guy who I only knew in passing. I was naked and my body hurt in ways I had no clue it was capable of hurting." Her lips twisted dryly as she finally gathered the courage to look up at Agatha. "About four months later, I found out I was pregnant. It... it could have destroyed me, but I have always been so damn stubborn."
    </p>
<p>
     A flicker of agreement, and understanding, flashed over Agatha, dashingly quick. It touched Rio, a gentle grace of her soul.
    </p>
<p>
     "Every day for the last almost twenty two years, I have never regretted my decision to keep her. She is... my light, my reason, my sanity. She is my entire world, and watching as she grows, shaping into this amazing young woman with a ferocity and determination that just blows me away? It feels like my biggest accomplishment that I raised her. Me, alone, her whole life.
     <i>
      I did that.
     </i>
     I am the main reason that she is able to find joy and spread it like a cure to all that ails the world. I am why she strives to be the best person she can possibly be. I know it sounds like a brag, like I think so highly of myself, but... I know her. I know that for as much as she is everything to me, I am all she has ever known."
    </p>
<p>
     The longer she spoke, the more she could see the tides of different emotions swelling and ebbing inside of Agatha. She had a child, she knew what it was like to love another being so impossibly wholly that it made little to no sense. She knew what it was like to hope, day after day, that you had somehow been able to help create a productive member of society, or, even more, someone who could make a difference.
    </p>
<p>
     This tender quiet settled over them and there was only the feel of their hands, the soft even sounds of their breathing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt bare. She felt naked, like the armor of secrets she had been carrying with her had been peeled away by the woman next to her, a piece at a time. It had been a sudden but careful process, but Rio knew it was inevitable. She had known it the first time her fingers wrapped around Agatha's wet hand and pulled her out of the water.
    </p>
<p>
     She had known, immediately, that Agatha could so easily be her undoing.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have the same affection for Nicky," Agatha responded softly, her own eyes on their hands.
    </p>
<p>
     "Your son?" Rio asked quietly, her gaze lifting curiously.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nodded. "He's... a good kid. But, he also seemed to inherit his mother's complete and utter impulsivity and inability to weigh pros and cons of any given situation."
    </p>
<p>
     "You mentioned he was living in Dubai," Rio recalled, still studying the other woman, watching the warmth of her love for her son take hold of her.
    </p>
<p>
     "He created a dating app with a girl he went to high school with. It's basically all anonymous, but it's geared more toward finding connections through similar music tastes. It's been... really amazing to watch, but in the process he just..." Agatha hesitated, her eyes lifting straight ahead. "It just feels like he kind of forgot that Mom's still here, and she still likes hearing from him, and knowing he's okay." She exhaled a gentle sigh, a sad sigh. "I think... with what I do, he just assumes I no longer have time for him, but I have
     <i>
      always
     </i>
     made it when I needed to."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it, that gentle pull of understanding. They were both mothers who loved their children more than life itself, mothers who understood that life had its push and pull on those relationships, no matter how good of a parent they tried to be.
    </p>
<p>
     "He'll come around," Rio assured gently, though she had absolute zero grounds to even consider stating such a thing. She didn't know her son, and she arguably barely knew Agatha, but something in her could see it, that this woman lived and breathed for her child.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha breathed a soft laugh, that soft caress of her gaze holding onto Rio's face, as if for dear life.
    </p>
<p>
     "Your optimism is..." she started, but Rio was quick to cut in.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mildly annoying?" she offered, a brow lifting as the smallest smirk found her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha almost snorted, regarding her with a newfound softness.
    </p>
<p>
     "I was going to say... refreshing. After all, without such optimism, do you really think you would have spent fifteen hours on a plane and in airports to be sitting here with me?"
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, so, that was an incredibly fair point.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips parted, and the words sat on the very tip of her tongue, just waiting for the permission to fly free, but she was stuck, knowing that what they were? The weight they would hold? She hardly knew this woman, and yet? She said it anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     "I would have traveled to the ends of the earth to find you again," she admitted, the mixture of shame and honesty flashing in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     All at once, Agatha's hand lifted and affectionately cupped Rio's cheek, her thumb brushing light lines along the curve of her cheekbone. Rio had been anticipating the kiss that was sure to follow, but... the moment hung startlingly still between them.
    </p>
<p>
     There it was again, those eyes digging, burrowing deep within her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      What the hell was she looking at? What the hell did she see?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "Do you..." Agatha started in a quiet murmur, her eyes flickering down to Rio's lips, then back up to her gaze, "believe in soulmates?"
    </p>
<p>
     The cross between amusement and curiosity settled over Rio as she considered, though her eyes never left Agatha's face.
    </p>
<p>
     In her smitten haze, she had somehow missed the actual gravity of the question, but responded honestly, nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I have never believed much when it comes to love. My loneliness for years is indicative of that. But... I believe that there are people out there, people who have lived and experienced a life entirely different from my own, but because of that, those people have developed parts and pieces for themselves that i would never have had the experiences to know they needed to be planted."
     </i>
     Rio hesitated, letting go of a soft, tension-filled breath.
     <i>
      "I believe that sometimes, the edges of those pieces, the give and pull of how a puzzle works... two people can fit together just right, just enough to offer a fuller view, while still limited, to the bigger picture."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio watched as Agatha blinked at her, a pure, unadulterated look of absolute fascination stuck to her face. After a brief pause, Rio realized something.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was looking at her the way she had looked at her when she had asked Agatha about religion, and she had provided her answer.
    </p>
<p>
     Another moment passed and the tension broke, snapping like a rubber band that had been stretched beyond its capabilities.
    </p>
<p>
     She had still been acutely aware of the touch on her face, still present, but it was impossible to ignore as it moved, Agatha's fingers sliding into her hair as she pulled her closer, though with nowhere near the urgency she had exuded earlier in the day. Instead, her movements were slow and deliberate, making sure that Rio was entirely aware of what she was requesting of her in that moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Without hesitation, Rio met her halfway. Their lips brushed, a barely-there skimming of soft skin. It was a show, on Agatha's end, she was sure. It was a show of thanks for the things Rio had been so willing to share with her. It was the whisper of gratitude that, when given the choice, Rio had chosen to let her in.
    </p>
<p>
     It was sweet, and Rio understood it for what it was, but she wanted more. She wanted to bask in the feeling of this woman's adoration, to let the feeling of being wanted just cover her, head to toe. It could smother her, for all she cared. Being wanted, for her, was a high she couldn't stop chasing. She wanted it, and when she got it? She wanted more.
    </p>
<p>
     She got her wish as Agatha pressed the slightest bit closer to her, fully kissing her with an intent, with a sense of determination that was obvious in every fluid moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew what it was like to kiss Agatha, as was proven by the display in the office earlier in the day. But what was happening in that moment? Agatha was not just kissing her. Agatha was peppering affection over every inch of her soul. It wasn't frenzied or hurried. It was a slow, sweet moment of nothing but lips on lips, hands on warm skin. Rio's own fingers had wrapped around the wrist of the hand that was gently tangled into her hair, holding Agatha there, as if she was not going to get even an inch away.
    </p>
<p>
     For a long few moments, that was all it was. It was a lip lock that was designed to root them in the moment, to tether them together. The warmth of it had snugly fit around the both of them, kissing each other like life itself was dependent on it, that three hundred dollar bottle of liquor still cradled by the covers beneath them.
    </p>
<p>
     They separated after a little bit longer, though their breathing was a bit louder and the serene sound of it felt good, felt pristine in Rio's ears.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You've got to stop letting me do that,"
     </i>
     Agatha hummed warmly, her breath still hot on Rio's lips.
     <i>
      "Because I swear, I won't ever stop if you don't tell me to."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The softest, most pure sound of complete delight fluttered from Rio's lips in the shape of a giggle. The reaction it had was instant, a softness sweeping over Agatha's entire being.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes were bright as she considered.
    </p>
<p>
     "As fun as that sounds," Rio murmured back, a spark of mischief flashing in her gaze for the briefest moment, "I've been quite enjoying playing '896 questions on the second date.'"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha smiled, sweet and soft.
    </p>
<p>
     "So it
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     a date," she mused, the cutest light finding her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blushed, glancing away for a brief moment. She knew that she needed to work on her composure, but damn if Agatha did not get under her skin with little to no effort.
    </p>
<p>
     "You literally fell into my life because I whistled at you. At the time, I assumed dinner was obligatory," she teased back softly, though there was some truth peppered in with the statement.
    </p>
<p>
     She had felt some guilt, some of the blame for what had happened that afternoon, but it was apparent that every single thing she had done since? Well, Agatha apparently appreciated it enough to be sitting there telling her that she had the willful intentions of drowning her in attention.
    </p>
<p>
     And then a thought struck Rio, the dawning realization of her forgetfulness washing over her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What a soft place to land,"
     </i>
     she breathed in a bit of a mystified whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's face softened, beholding this woman before her.
    </p>
<p>
     "So you found that too," she deduced, wearing an expression that screamed that she couldn't have been more thrilled.
    </p>
<p>
     "You left that day, and then still somehow lived in my house for weeks."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's brows lifted, her delight clear between them.
    </p>
<p>
     "I
     <i>
      have
     </i>
     been told I can be a bit... haunting." She laughed, a soft sound that brought a sense of joy bubbling in Rio's chest.
    </p>
<p>
     "Could be worse," Rio murmured, brushing the tips of their noses together. "You could have stalked a complete stranger halfway across the world in the hope that they might give you five minutes of their time."
    </p>
<p>
     "Why would I do that when you're
     <i>
      so
     </i>
     good at it?"
    </p>
<p>
     It was Rio, this time, who chose to do away with any inkling of space between them. She pressed forward, stealing another kiss, one that started innocently enough.
    </p>
<p>
     That feeling of closeness, of warm contact, it was enough to send her rocketing off into space. It was no longer just a sense of feeling light or weightless. No, she was being propelled to reach the stars, to burn, scorching in the heat of the sun. She wanted to revel in it, to wrap it around herself tightly, to compress herself in that feeling that filled her from the top of her head to the tips of her toes.
    </p>
<p>
     They stayed tangled like that for a few minutes, hot breaths, soft pants, hands gently exploring over fabric. Nothing was being pushed, no agenda, just a general understanding that they had time before them, and they could use it appropriately. Finally, Rio gently removed her lips from Agatha's, though her compulsion to stay close did not wane, their foreheads pressing softly together.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Who the fuck are you, and where have you been my entire life?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's question elicited a sound so delectable and sweet, a tantalizing mixture of an amused laugh and something more. Something... deep.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Waiting to take the plunge, I suppose."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The tension in the space around them was thick, but not heavy. Rio understood it as a line they were standing on opposing sides of, both inching closer, gauging the other's reaction to the removal of space between them, in the metaphorical sense. Physically? Physically, they couldn't get close enough.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched her with an intense desire to just... know her. To just know everything she could possibly know about her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Tell me something," Rio beguiled, her eyes focused on Agatha's, on the way she gave a little nod to signify that it was okay to continue.
     <i>
      "Why did you come back that day?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Warmth radiated in Agatha's expression as she regarded Rio with that unbridled affection that was rooted deep within her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Because I needed to know your name."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The answer was so simple, so honest, and yet there was such a weight to it, a poundage that held it solid and firm where it sat, that answer nestling in the pit of Rio's stomach. Everything about this was so unfamiliar and new, and yet, in her bones, Rio could have sworn that it was the one place she had always meant to be. The comfort was overwhelming, and the ease with which she felt she could just exist was something she had not known she could feel.
    </p>
<p>
     Though they had been stuck like that, forehead to forehead for several long moments, Rio could feel the rise of something inside of her. It was an insatiable need to be closer filling her, brimming over the edges of her entire being.
    </p>
<p>
     She reached between them and pulled the bottle of brandy into her lap so that she could wiggle her hips enough to scoot over, sealing that remaining space, too. Agatha sensed what she was doing and adjusted accordingly, lifting an arm so that she could wrap it around Rio's shoulders, pulling her firmly into her side. Without hesitation, Rio's head fell to Agatha's shoulder, her eyes shutting in complete surrender.
    </p>
<p>
     Experiencing all of this, all of these emotions? These were literally all things that were entirely new to Rio. She had not been loved, or even cared for, by someone who was not her child. She had not been treasured, or coveted throughout her entire forty years on the earth, and she had never been bothered by it.
    </p>
<p>
     It had never really mattered one way or the other, until it had.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio was thinking, in those moments as she felt a sense of peace rest over her like a weighted blanket, was that she had been missing out. And then, she wondered if anyone else she could have possibly ever met in her life could have ever made her feel like she did right then, snugly fit against Agatha's side, the weight of the other woman's grasp heavy and comforting in its sense of safety over her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew she could spend all night picking it apart, trying to dissect this insane and instant attraction that had developed between the two of them. She could understand her own insanity, but then she realized that if she was insane? Well, she was staring at a spitting image of someone else who was, too, when she looked at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you want to know something?" Agatha whispered into the quiet, her fingertips beginning to trace light lines up Rio's arms.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes lifted, but her head did not move. Agatha still seemed to sense her interest, and decided to keep going.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have this director friend. I've known him a while; he's younger, but he's a good guy. I texted him after I came home and asked him to pick between two locations, one in Australia, and the one near you. He asked why I was struggling when I was usually so decisive. I told him it was because I knew I could not make a decision without bias."
    </p>
<p>
     This intrigued Rio. Their meeting had really effected her to that point, that she was questioning solid business decisions because she thought she was only making them based on personal feelings?
    </p>
<p>
     "He ended up prying it out of me, what happened. I think that honestly, he didn't believe me for a solid ten minutes. He asked how much money I wanted for the publishing rights to a script." She laughed, the hand that was on Rio's shoulder raising to gently comb through her hair. This caused Rio, too, to breathe a soft chuckle. She had to admit -- it was literally insane. There were films made over decades that were not nearly as good as the reality they were living out. "If anyone's making that blockbuster, I think I could do it justice before anybody else."
    </p>
<p>
     There was a strong satisfaction that warmed Rio, causing her skin to sheet in a thin layer of goosebumps. The way Agatha sat there talking, it made her feel like she was not as crazy as she had convinced herself they were. Sure, they were still in those beginning stages, but it was clear that the other woman saw the same thing she had: The gold string of fate, running from one chest to another, binding them together.
    </p>
<p>
     "What time is it?" Rio posed, her tone thick with exhaustion. She was a bit too worn to do the math, but she was pretty confident that she had been awake over twenty four hours.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's about ten 'til midnight," Agatha responded after glancing over at her phone on the bed beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     In her comfort, Rio had forgotten something very important. To extend an invitation.
    </p>
<p>
     "You'll stay tonight, won't you?" she asked, trying to fight to keep the desperation out of her voice. She had just gotten there, it seemed, and she wasn't ready to part ways so soon.
    </p>
<p>
     The corners of Agatha's eyes wrinkled with her smile, her head bobbing in a gentle nod.
    </p>
<p>
     "But only if you let me buy you midnight sushi from a flower shop basement."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes shimmered with a fondness as she recalled her own prior comment about wanting something that Agatha kept a secret.
    </p>
<p>
     "You really know all the spots, don't you?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha laughed, a light and flittering sound that seemed to expand, hugging every wall in the room.
    </p>
<p>
     "Give me a sec," she mused, turning her head slightly to brush her lips against Rio's forehead as she reached for her phone. She pulled it into her lap and set to work, triumphantly placing it back on the bed a moment later. "Food's ordered. The delivery guy will be here in twenty five minutes."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio found herself asking the internal question again that still seemed to have no apparent answer: How the Hell had this happened?
    </p>
<p>
     She was so comfortable, so rested, so relaxed as she sat there nestled into the side of the other woman. She knew that the road that lay ahead of them was filled with plenty of opportunities for them to learn and explore, and so she took that night for what it was: a moment to rest in a place where not only did she felt safe, but she felt cared for. She felt, for those passing minutes, like this woman just completely cared about her, about her well-being and her state of mind. She cared about pouring attention into her, about making her see that to Agatha? Rio was haunting in her own right.
    </p>
<p>
     They were both quiet, reserved in their silence as the soft hum of the tv played from across the room. Rio was exhausted, but she was fighting it long enough so that they could share their meal and she could inevitably pass out to catch up on some of the sleep she had been depriving herself of over the last day.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft tap at the door signified the arrival of their dinner and Agatha whispered a soft request for a moment as she removed herself from Rio's side, leaving it cold with the sudden lack of body heat. Rio's eyes slid shut as she listened to the soft exchange, and then the door shut again. She could hear those barely-there footsteps as they carried Agatha back toward the bed, the soft crinkle of the bag rustling as she set it down, her own weight causing the mattress to sink as she fit herself onto it. There was not even a single second of hesitation as she slid right back up into her position against Rio's side.
    </p>
<p>
     They ate, mostly in the quiet noise of the television; it had become pretty apparent that the day had taken its toll on them and rest was in their immediate future, but there was still something hovering around them that Rio could not ignore.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the dull drum of potential.
    </p>
<p>
     She put the last bite of her sushi into her mouth and chewed thoughtfully for a moment before she swallowed, her gaze sweeping over to the other woman, even as the chopsticks were still poised in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm really glad I'm here,"
     </i>
     Rio admitted, a shy divulgence that was truly underselling how she really felt.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha regarded her with a gentle reverence, but otherwise remained still.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm really glad you're here too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She punctuated that sentiment by leaning toward Rio, their shoulders pressed firmly together as their lips brushed in another heaven-sent kiss. It was brief, but it sent Rio's pulse pounding in her neck. And then, there was space between them, but it was filled with Agatha's immediate question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you ready to lay down?" There was a tender curiosity there, one that made Rio blush. She nodded her head gently in response, and Agatha set to cleaning things off the bed to prepare for sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted herself to her feet, making her way over to her duffel bag. She pulled out a t-shirt and then glanced up, over her shoulder, at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you want something more comfortable to sleep in?" Rio questioned, her tones hushed. Agatha's head lifted and she offered a smile that seemed to answer the question.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached in, pulling out another shirt, but then hesitated. She stared down into the bag, her mind turning circles. She grabbed only one pair of shorts and turned back to meet Agatha at the corner of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     "Here's a shirt and a pair of shorts. I... don't normally sleep in anything but a shirt and underwear, but if that's any kind of an issue, I can wear shorts," she tried to explain in a soft rush, but the amusement was already painting itself in Agatha's expression.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think I can practice some self-restraint for a night," Agatha offered, though her tone was low and textured, like it was meant to be enticing.
    </p>
<p>
     And it might have been, had Rio not been so thoroughly depleted.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached up and plucked one of the shirts from her grasp, her eyes sweeping down to the shorts before they cast up, flicking in instruction toward the bag. Rio was stunned for a moment, a low thud of something happening in her middle. She obliged, though, turning back to toss the shorts back into the bag. With her back to Agatha, and a mind too tired to consider any ability to be embarrassed, she stripped down.
    </p>
<p>
     Her jeans, her hunter green tank top, her bra all laid in a small heap at her feet as she finished tugging the sleep shirt over her head. The hem of it hung down low enough to not be considered too revealing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned, and as she did, she froze, her gaze stuck on the profile of the woman, bare chested, as she reached up, sliding her own shirt over her head. It had been brief, nothing more than a stolen glance, but Rio had paid the price of forgetting how to breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a snapshot, a photo that she wasn't sure she should have gotten the chance to take, but it was there, locked away, those hues of dim orange light clinging to that bare torso in every right way, the long waves of her hair cascading down her back as her head tilted up to put the shirt on with ease. Her mind quickly scanned over the image in her mind, tracing over the curve of her breast from the side, the little pouch of skin that often signified childbirth, the tiniest bit over rollover at the waist of her underwear.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been a private moment, one Rio was certain she was not meant to see, but she coveted it beyond reason, nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness was a goddess, of that Rio was convinced.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the swelling of heat and deep pulse in her center, Rio willed herself toward the bed, sliding in between the covers with ease, her eyes shimmering as Agatha did the same. The other woman reached over and turned off the light, leaving them cast in the shadows left by the projection of the television that was still quietly droning on in the background.
    </p>
<p>
     The two seemed to gravitate toward one another, meeting in a compromise at the middle of the bed, legs tangling with no effort. Agatha's arm felt strong and secure as it slid into place over Rio's side, holding her close. It was like the best version of any dream Rio could have ever had, to be held by Agatha, to be coveted by this absolute masterpiece of a human being. She had wanted it to keep going, didn't want the night to end, but she could feel the sleep winning out. Her eyes were growing heavy and her breathing was beginning to even out.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel herself slipping; she could hear the faintest rumble of thunder outside and the sounds of the tv were still soft. However, as she would have a thought, it would glide from her grasp, falling away from her, leaving her wondering what she had just been thinking about. And then, like a shot in the night, a soft plea slipped from her half-asleep lips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Please don't leave in the morning,"
     </i>
     she requested in the smallest of whispers, as though she were a child begging for something they were scared they could not have.
    </p>
<p>
     The response was a pressing of lips to the skin of her forehead.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm not going anywhere, darling."
     </i>

<p>
     There had never been a thought, the night before, to pull the curtains shut. It would explain, then, why Rio winced slightly at the light that poured into the room as she stirred to consciousness. It was so bright, nearly blinding, and it disoriented her, leaving her trying to place where she was and what was going on.
    </p>
<p>
     She rolled onto her back, her arms flat out on either side of her and a groggy sigh passed through her lips. She pulled her eyes open against the heavy weight of wanting more sleep, and if she had thought she was disoriented before?
    </p>
<p>
     It took all of three seconds for life to catch up with her. She was in America. In Los Angeles. She had come to find Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand swatted at the side of the bed the other woman had been on, confirming there was nothing there. She felt her heart sink, her last words still ringing through her mind. She had asked her not to leave.
    </p>
<p>
     And she had left anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     Groggily, Rio sat up, wiping the sleep out of her eyes as she surveyed the room, first sweeping over to the bedside table on the far side of the bed. No phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Her gaze landed across the room, though, at that desk. There, still hung on the back of the chair, was Agatha's coat, and not half a foot away sat her purse on the desk. Something brimmed in Rio's chest, a blossoming warmth that she could feel creeping out of her chest and into every other part of her.
    </p>
<p>
     The question still remained: Where was Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     She exhaled a long breath as she leaned back against the headboard and grabbed her own phone, pulling up her messaging app.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Shit.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She still didn't have her number. Her lips worried together for a moment as she stared down at the phone in her hands, realizing after a moment that she had somehow opened a text without realizing it, one from Estee.
    </p>
<p>
     "You okay, mama? How's it going?"
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, Rio felt a surge of guilt that she had not been communicating with her daughter since she had landed.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, mija. I found her. We drank at the bar here and had sushi. She stayed the night."
    </p>
<p>
     Her grin was instant at her daughter's reply.
    </p>
<p>
     "You will definitely be giving me way more than that the next time we facetime."
    </p>
<p>
     She was still staring down, smiling stupidly at the sheer amount of joy she felt to be having that conversation with her daughter, even with the ocean between them. There was a sound, though, of the lock on the door clicking, which caused a wrinkle in Rio's brow.
    </p>
<p>
     The door swung open and in strode Agatha, that air of confidence and certainty about her as she held the door open. Another man in a uniform pushed a silver cart through the door with his head down, one that was laden with plates covered in cloches and chilled bottles of champagne and orange juice on the bottom level.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes danced with light, feeling completely and utterly flattered that someone had gone to such lengths just to make her feel good. Well, she wasn't certain if that was Agatha's motive, but it was exactly what was happening. Rio felt like a diety, like this woman was a patron of her shrine and would send whatever offering she could to please her, to make her feel coveted. It was working. All of it was working.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha thanked the man and slid a bill into his palm -- a quirk Rio had noticed, tipping the help well -- and he turned, pulling the door shut behind him.
    </p>
<p>
     In an instant, Agatha's attention turned to her, full and focused. She felt like the sun, like Agatha just wanted nothing more to bask in the light of her presence. She clapped her hands together, glancing down at the cart. For the first time, she realized what Agatha was wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     She had put the shirt Rio had given her the night before on again and something in Rio's middle stirred at the fact that Agatha had dug just enough to pull out a pair of sweatpants that were a hair too short -- Rio's legs were not as quite as long as hers -- but they hugged every other part of her perfectly.
    </p>
<p>
     She eyed her, a dull ember flickering across her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "You went through my things?" she posed coyly, as if in challenge, though the struggle to keep the smile off of her lips was intense.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's face fell, her hands dropping as she realized the breach of privacy.
    </p>
<p>
     "I, um... I didn't think... I'm so--"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips split into a full grin and she dissolved into laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's okay. I'm not upset. I just wanted to give you a hard time."
    </p>
<p>
     The realization that she was not, in fact, in trouble settled over Agatha, the quick tension seeping out of her muscles with ease. Then, a flicker of mischief.
    </p>
<p>
     "I suppose in that case, all of this breakfast is for me?" she posed, raising a brow in a silent dare. She broke, though, only a moment later, pulling the cart a little closer.
    </p>
<p>
     "I didn't know if you were a sweet or savory breakfast person yet, so there's a benedict and an order of French toast, so I can take whichever you don't want. The bowl of fruit I figured we could share, and of course mimosas. "
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was talking, and Rio knew what she was saying, but she wasn't listening -- not really. Instead, she was just staring, watching, understanding. She was realizing something very fast: Agatha cared. They had spent a total of two days together, with a month of time between them, and yet, in that moment? There was this mix of feeling like they were both in the beginning stages of attraction and also like they had been at this for a while. The ease between them was startling, and Rio was certain that the catch was coming, eventually.
    </p>
<p>
     For now? She would enjoy what she could get. And what she was getting? A woman who had ordered food and alcohol for breakfast and brought it up to the room? What on earth had she ever done to be so deserving?
    </p>
<p>
     She was struck with a thought.
    </p>
<p>
     "How did you get back in?" Rio posed, though Agatha was mid-move toward the desk with something pressed against her palm. She stopped and pushed it toward her fingertips, holding up the keycard. Rio grinned, a soft breath of a chuckle passing her lips as Agatha set it back down on the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha handed over the French toast, per Rio's request, and she could see the silent annotation; it had been something else to learn about her, something Agatha marked down with piqued interest.
    </p>
<p>
     They ate and discussed things like the weather, what there was to do on a Sunday, what the beach conditions looked like. They formed a basic outline of the things they might do throughout the day, but Agatha notated that she needed to run home for a few things first. Rio had, missing the beat, volunteered that it would give her time to shower and get ready. Agatha's face had fallen slightly, but it picked right back up after the passing of a second.
    </p>
<p>
     As they finished breakfast, Rio found herself staring down at the empty plate in front of her, a thought briefly springing to life in her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Her voice was curious, not accusatory or harsh.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you charge this to the room?" she asked softly, her gaze lifting to Agatha. The look she wore, the expression on her face had such a casual nonchalance.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did." She could tell that Agatha could hear her reaction, and picked it up immediately. "After I changed the payment information to my card."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha!" Rio's voice was sharp, but it was still warm. "You should not be paying for me to stay here."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged, tipping her head back to down some of her drink.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't
     <i>
      have
     </i>
     to, but I
     <i>
      want
     </i>
     to. And I will until you make the decision that you'd be comfortable enough to come stay with me, instead."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked, stunned to silence. Agatha wanted to take her
     <i>
      home?
     </i>
     It had to seem stupid; Agatha had immediately been welcomed into her home, but Rio was well aware that it was only because of the circumstances. The fact that Agatha was looking her in the face, her sincerity practically bleeding through her, telling her that she wanted Rio's presence in her safe haven? It made her mouth dry, and made a pitch of nerves hike up her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes softened as she beheld the other woman, a soft sense of regard washing over her.
    </p>
<p>
     "We will see," she offered back, though there was a hint of promise to her tone. She knew that if things continued the way they had been going since she arrived, it was inevitable but she did not want to put any undue pressure on the situation, or set any kind of an expectation. She did not want Agatha to feel like anything was owed, here, or like there was some set standard of what this was supposed to look like.
    </p>
<p>
     This was a mess, at first glance.
    </p>
<p>
     It seemed, though, that Agatha was willing to sit dutifully by her side as they sorted it out and untangled the threads of what had drawn them together. The attraction was undeniable, but what about what came after? What about when it came down to the nitty gritty? Sure, they had already started breaking those walls down, but when would it come? When would the moment hit when they realized that their vastly different lives would stand in the way of anything they might have hoped to build together?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was pensive, observant for a moment as she watched Rio, a fondness settling in her features.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you want to go see it, at least? You can come with me while I change and re-do my face."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's smile was soft and she gave a gentle nod. "Let me shower really fast," she offered, pulling the cover back so that she could prepare to get out of the bed, but Agatha's hand was instant on her wrist. Her eyes lifted, those beautiful blue pools of warmth and desire peering right into her soul. Agatha raised her other hand, cupping Rio's chin in a firm hold of affection.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled her gently and Rio obliged, leaning into her, their lips brushing, softly at first, and then a little more firmly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Go on, hurry up!" she chided, giving Rio's cheek a soft pat as she quickly swiped another kiss before she leaned back against the headboard.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still grinning as she pulled herself from the bed and moved over to her bag, pulling out a change of clothes for the day. She doubled back to the bathroom, stealing a glance at Agatha over her shoulder, who was still watching her. She blushed under the heat of her gaze, tucking into the bathroom for a brief recovery.
    </p>
<p>
     Her shower was quick, and as she dressed and towel dried her hair, she found herself finding that dark reflection in the mirror, breaking if only just for a moment. What the hell was she doing? Who did she think she was to have Agatha Harkness sitting out there, waiting for her in the bed they had both slept in the night before?
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't know, but she wasn't going to stop the careening descent until someone made her.
    </p>
<p>
     She hung the towel and made her exit from the bathroom, those eyes landing on her almost instantly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked so... what was the word? Struck? Stunned? Taken aback? She just blinked at Rio, her lips slowly easing into a smile, an adoration overtaking her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You are so beautiful."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The blush was back instantly, heat pooling onto her cheeks and neck.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are the first to tell me, but with your sincerity, I am inclined to believe you," Rio shot back, her expression soft, reverent.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha climbed out of the bed, having changed back into her clothes from the day before, and stepped up to Rio, her hands finding Rio's sides with a starling ease. They were close, and Agatha's eyes on her felt heavy, weighted, like she was doing that thing again where she was seeing far beyond her skin. Unnerving her. Leaving her restless.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could dwell on it much longer, Agatha leaned toward her. There was no hold, no grip that was voicing what she wanted, but Rio understood it anyway. She met her, her own hands on Agatha's biceps as their lips met again, a kiss that was brief, but it said exactly what it needed to.
    </p>
<p>
     With another warm smile, Agatha grabbed her hand and they set about their day.
    </p>
<p>
     The car Agatha had called for had arrived and Rio watched with rapt interest as the world moved beyond them on the other side of those windows. The city was massive, and there was so much to see, even at a street level. It was incredible, really, but she was still aware, in the back of her mind, that Agatha was still clinging to her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     The car pulled out of the immediate city, the landscape beginning to fill out more with flat green areas, vineyards dotting them every so often. The longer they drove, the more the view continued to shift. Soon, they were rolling up the highway and Agatha gave a soft squeeze, pulling Rio's attention. As she looked over, Agatha was indicating the window and she followed, taking in what was across the highway.
    </p>
<p>
     It was blue and vast, and while Rio had spent the majority of her life on the water, seeing it like that, on the Pacific coast? It was breathtaking.
    </p>
<p>
     It was only a few more moments by the time the car slowed, pulling along a street that was incredibly long, each house having exponential space between it and the one next to it. They were massive homes, beautiful in their architecture and their presentation. Some of them were fronted with glass, some of them had keeps reminiscent of grand castles.
    </p>
<p>
     The car slowed and Rio's gaze swept to the view of the home outside of the window, an active battle taking over her as she tried to keep her mouth from falling open. The home was... massive. It was two stories, visibly, because she could not see the lower level from the front view of the house. There were two large garages, the doors a dark mahogany with ornate gold handles, trimmed with a dark brown molding.
    </p>
<p>
     It, as well as the rest of the house, was covered in a cream stone layout, giving it a legitimate castle feel. The house itself hung around in an angled shape similar to the letter 'j.' The shutters matched the color of the trim on the garage, and the windows were framed perfectly, set in just the right places. There were pillars that stretched from the overhang from the roof down to the balcony on the second floor, then down to the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was... verklempt. She didn't know what to say, or what to think. She had seen those glaringly obvious signs that Agatha was well off, including the three times she had tipped the wait staff at least a hundred dollars. Still, somehow it had not really set in until that moment that this woman was
     <i>
      wealthy.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to read the apprehension on Rio's startled expression and squeezed her hand a little tighter.
    </p>
<p>
     "We can have a conversation about it later," she offered in a gentle tone, her other hand reaching up to brush at Rio's cheek affectionately.
    </p>
<p>
     This seemed to satisfy Rio, who only let go of Agatha in order to climb out of the car and follow her up the walk to the home, still completely overwhelmed by the sheer size of it. If she had thought it was beautiful from the outisde?
    </p>
<p>
     She nearly lost her breath as they stepped over the threshold into the home. It was striking, the painfully white walls that were decorated in different pieces of framed art, the foyer opening up into a wide and open living room with a two story ceiling. There was a winding staircase to the left that led up the stairs, a balcony portion of the hallway bridging over the official entrance to the living space.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could not hide the awe that had completely overtaken her. The further they went into the house, the deeper it ran. This was... amazing. As the room opened up, there was a fireplace on the far wall, carefully designed shelving on either side, and an incredibly large television bolted to the wall above the stone mantle.
    </p>
<p>
     In the middle of it all, a thought struck her.
    </p>
<p>
     That twenty inch television they had watched that night.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft breath of a laugh escaped her lips, but Agatha didn't seem to notice.
    </p>
<p>
     "This... it's really, really beautiful." Her compliment was genuine, and she could tell that she landed the way had hoped it would.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you. Make yourself at home, I'll be as quick as I can," she informed her, leaning in to press her full lips to the apple of Rio's cheek sweetly before she departed to shower and change.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      I wonder if this is what she felt like
     </i>
     Rio thought to herself
     <i>
      when she was alone in my home.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The nosy part of her had surfaced and while she kept it mainly tempered and did not venture anywhere outside of the room she was in, she couldn't help but to want to inspect what she could see. The walls had varying styles of art, from Japanese Contemporary to Moorish Revival, and something in Rio told her that each piece had been specifically selected for reasons she could only hope to learn over time.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned her attention to the shelves on either side of the fireplace. There were decorative candles, small knick nacks, but most noticeably, there were several photos of Agatha and her son. Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could think to stop herself, she reached forward, picking one in a black frame up off of the shelf, looking down at it.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky looked younger than Agatha said he currently was, probably about fifteen, and Agatha was stood next to him, each of them securing the other in a one-armed hold. Agatha was wearing a fitted lilac gown, her hair twisted up into a bun, pinned tightly at the back of her head. Nicky stood beside her in a dark grey tuxedo, a bright and beaming smile on his face, his own hair pinned neatly atop his head in a tight bun, too, a few stray curls sticking out by his ears.
    </p>
<p>
     Most notably, there was a golden statue clutched in Agatha's hand. Judging by Nicky's age, Rio found herself safe in the assumption that it was probably a photo of the night Agatha had won her first Oscar. They both looked so happy, ecstatic in her victory. It was... touching.
    </p>
<p>
     She replaced it back in its spot on the shelf, shifting to look at other photos, most of them together, but a few stray ones of Nicky through the years, from a toddler to a teen. The most recent one, Rio figured, by the sight of the Burj Khalifa standing resolute in the background. He looked happy, looked like the world was in the palm of his hand, and the joy of it was resounding in his smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ahem," she heard over her shoulder, causing her chin to pull over it, a sheepish expression landing snugly over her. She was dressed smartly, though not entirely business. She had on a short sleeved lavender blouse that had one small flower embroidered into the corner of the chest pocket. A pair of slightly torn denim jeans hugged those slender, toned legs, and nude flats covered her feet. She looked so... effortless.
    </p>
<p>
     "I was just looking," she insisted, turning back to face Agatha, pacing over to her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know. Because I'm guilty of the same thing, you just didn't happen to bust me."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio breathed a laugh, giving a shrug in agreement. She couldn't really argue that point.
    </p>
<p>
     "Shall we? I booked us a reservation at Redbird for lunch and then we can see where the day takes us."
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you always just... completely manhandle any situation you encounter?" Rio asked in astonishment, though there was the hint of amusement in her tone.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love it here," she said in a tone that was almost a correction, a reminder. "I want you to see all of my favorite parts." The words hung between them for a moment, and she watched as a silent battle waged within Agatha, and one side won as she spoke again, a daring sparkle in her eyes. "Maybe I can make you love it enough that you can't stand to be away."
    </p>
<p>
     Funny, Rio thought. If she was going to fall in love with anything enough to want to stay, it was certainly not going to be the city itself.
    </p>
<p>
     She caught herself at the tail end of that thought, startled at the ease with which it had come. While this was obviously an unconventional whirlwind, she still had to find a way to keep herself in check, to remind herself that everything about this was still fragile, and needed to be handled with care.
    </p>
<p>
     They departed the expansive home and made their lunch reservations, Rio seeming to eat up any moment of Agatha's time that she had to offer. They ate, shared a drink, and then spend the day venturing through the city. They would stop in the occasional store, browse, and move along to the next. Agatha would occasionally drop a little anecdote about a bar they passed, or a restaurant they had to try at some point, and Rio absorbed it all, every single droplet of knowledge careening right into her awaiting bucket.
    </p>
<p>
     By later afternoon, they found themselves on the patio of a restaurant on Venice Beach, two glasses of chilled white wine sitting between them. The conversation had hardly hit a snag all day; it was free flowing and easy, just a constant give and take of information, of personal facts, stories of life, and random knowledge.
    </p>
<p>
     Talking to Agatha was the easiest thing in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     The sun had set by the time they finished their meals and just as Rio was about to suggest that they could go back to the hotel, Agatha's eyes lifted, alight with an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you want to see if anyone left a fire burning?" Rio's brow wrinkled slightly in confusion, but Agatha's gaze swept to the sand. "On the beach."
    </p>
<p>
     The realization dawned on her and she followed the direction Agatha had been looking, seeing the faint orange glow of an unattended fire. She smiled warmly and gave a gentle nod. In a familiar move, now, she hardly had to look for it as Agatha's hand held out expectantly and Rio slid her own into it with utter ease.
    </p>
<p>
     They removed their shoes at the edge of the sidewalk and ventured out onto the sand, making their way over to the fire they had spotted from the patio. They placed themselves in front of it, the ocean casting out in a wide and open expanse just behind it, the moonlight dancing across it in fractured patterns, broken up by the waves.
    </p>
<p>
     She seemed to be locked into that moment, the vastness of it really touching something deep within her. There she sat, thousands of miles from home, missing her daughter like hell, but coping with it because the only thing she had wanted more was to find the woman that had turned her life upside down.
    </p>
<p>
     She had found her, and there they sat, thighs pressed together with Rio's hand cradled in both of Agatha's as she held them in her lap. It was a stunning snapshot of the pure chaos her life had become and yet, streaked across it, in every shift of the light, in every flicker of the stars, there was an undeniable beauty.
    </p>
<p>
     The universe had tipped Agatha over that bridge and into her life, and while she had momentarily been convinced that it was the only times their paths should ever cross, she was resolute in her understanding that her not coming to LA? It had never really been an option.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned her weight into Agatha's side, her head tipping to lay on her shoulder, the quiet reverence settling around them as the sounds of the waves lapping at the shore echoed around them.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Is this one of those moments?"
     </i>
     Agatha asked in hushed tones.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hm?"
     </i>
     Rio hummed in soft response, though she didn't move to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "The ones where you wonder if maybe there's a higher power out there?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio released a soft sigh in thoughtful response.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "How did you know?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Because it is for me. Only because I know that even if I am my own god, most times, this? This is beyond me. I... couldn't have even written this."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's head finally lifted, but it was a slow and tender motion, and she did not go far. She looked at Agatha's profile at close range, the dancing orange hues licking up her face. She leaned in a little closer, pressing her lips gingerly to Agatha's cheek.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Fate, I suppose, is sometimes a kind mistress, too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha's lips flickered up into a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     They sat like that for a little while longer, Rio's weight comfortably settled against Agatha, their hands together, the gentle and salty breeze of the ocean blowing over them. As the temperature began to sink, though, the cold began to set in. Agatha suggested they head back and Rio agreed easily, soaking in the last few moments on the beach as they waited for the car to arrive to pick them up.
    </p>
<p>
     They spoke in hushed tones as they recounted their day, the things they had seen and experienced, the way the city was full of wonder and astonishment. They recapped Rio's favorite parts, and as the car rolled to a stop in front of the hotel and they climbed out? She wanted to start it over, to live through it again. It had been truly perfect in the most simple way. How could what lay ahead of them be any better?
    </p>
<p>
     They entered the elevator and Agatha made the move without hesitation, pulling Rio into her side in a warm embrace, her lips pressing to the top of Rio's head. They stood like that, silently holding one another until the door opened and the finished the venture to Rio's room.
    </p>
<p>
     In an instant, Rio realized something. Agatha had a bag with her. The revelation made her stomach flip in delight. She didn't have to ask again; Agatha had made it clear that until Rio was ready to check out? She was going to be pretty present.
    </p>
<p>
     They parted and changed, and Rio was ready for the closeness climbing into that bed would have to offer. Her phone dinged on the nightstand, though, and the tiniest wrinkle formed in her brow. She lifted it up, turning the screen to face her as she looked down at her, a message from Estee sitting unopened.
    </p>
<p>
     She slid onto the bed, one leg hanging over the edge as the other folded in front of her. She unlocked the phone and opened the message, her breath catching in her chest at what she saw. It was a three word message, and it nearly ended Rio right then and there.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Elias messaged me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The tears were almost instant, stinging at the backs of her eyes. She fought them as hard as she could, but they still spilled silently down cheeks that were now flamed red. Her hands trembled and she felt a knot of emotion sitting dead center in the middle of her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to notice the stillness and the silence, almost immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio?"
    </p>
<p>
     But Rio didn't respond, she just stared at the message. Estee was undoubtedly waiting on a response, but Rio had absolutely no clue what to say.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio..." Agatha said again, this time her voice a little more firm, trying to pull her attention. Slowly, the tears still rolling down her cheeks in steady streams, Rio lifted her head.
    </p>
<p>
     She could almost see it, the breaking of Agatha's heart in her chest. She just wanted to know what was wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     She was quick on her feet, gliding straight over to where Rio sat on the bed, placing herself on it directly in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What's wrong?"
     </i>
     Agatha tried to pull, so gently, as she reached forward and placed a comforting touch on Rio's arm.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I... I..."
     </i>
     she stammered, unable to look up and unable to form words. She was stuck, unable to speak more than a soft stutter of a beginning she couldn't finish.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly and carefully, Agatha reached down and pulled the phone from Rio's hands, otherwise not doing anything with it aside from setting it down on the mattress next to them. She scooted forward, closer, and gathered Rio on her arms, tucking her head beneath her chin to compress her as much as possible.
    </p>
<p>
     Something had clearly upset her, and Agatha was under no misconceptions that it had anything to do with her, but she wanted to fix it, regardless. She understood pretty quickly that Rio was not immediately ready to talk and so instead, Agatha would do the only thing she could, which was to offer physical comfort.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let her hold her, those tears having a hard time finding a way to dry. She knew she owed Agatha an explanation, but something in her was crushed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "The man... that raped me, he reached out to Estee for the first time in her life."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could almost hear it, beneath her ear: The distinct sound of Agatha's heart breaking. She could feel her lips on the crown of her head, which seemed to shatter her even further.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I've got you, darling,"
     </i>
     Agatha soothed in a low murmur, her hand coming up to run comfortingly over her hair.
     <i>
      "It's going to be alright."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In a moment when she shouldn't have, she put every bit of stock she had into believing the words Agatha said. Because if it wasn't?
    </p>
<p>
     She had no idea that she would do.

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     For about fifteen minutes, that had been all Rio had been able to say. It was the only thing she had been able to manage, and only because she knew that it was a silent debt that she owed to the other occupant in the room. The reality of it was raining down on her like shattered glass, completely cutting her open one slice at a time, and there had been no shield.
    </p>
<p>
     At least, not the immediate instant the wound had been inflicted, the second in time when Rio had read that message.
    </p>
<p>
     In the minutes following? Agatha metaphorically had thrown herself into the line of fire, shielding Rio from the damage as much as she could. In the physical sense, she sat there, so patient and kind as she just kept her arms firmly around Rio's slightly smaller frame. Her fingers had not once stopped the gentle combing through her hair, and every so often, Agatha would breathe a phrase meant to offer comfort.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      It's okay.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      You're safe.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      I'm right here.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      Get it out.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      Just keep breathing.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Despite the fact that Rio felt utterly lost in the flurry of every sour emotion that curdled in the pit of her stomach, she felt... grounded. There was a ribbon around her ankle as she began to drift, but Agatha was there, holding on for dear life. There was something in her grip that nearly shouted that she couldn't stand to let Rio get even an inch away when something was wounding her so badly.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      They were strangers.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's question hung heavy in her mind in that moment:
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Do you believe in soulmates?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The thought caused her to curl into Agatha further, tucking her face in the skin of her neck. She was still sniffling softly, and she knew that her reaction could be masked with the fact that she was already struggling. That one time, that one second, it was okay to keep it to herself.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hey,"
     </i>
     Agatha coaxed gently, her hand sliding out of Rio's hair and down to her back, rubbing a gentle path up and down it. She pulled back the slightest bit so she could look down, and Rio met her gaze with a broken resolve, though it was still actively cracking in the irises of her eyes. Agatha's other hand reached up, a finger curling affectionately under Rio's chin.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why don't you take a moment, sit outside, and call her?" she suggested, and Rio simply blinked at her in response. She didn't think the suggestion was stupid -- no, she thought herself to be a complete idiot for not having considered it sooner. What was more? Agatha had known. There hadn't been any prodding, any poking to try to understand.
    </p>
<p>
     She just...
     <i>
      got it.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sniffled again, reaching up to wipe at one cheek, though in the same instance, Agatha's thumb caught her other cheek, brushing the trail of tears away. She straightened up a little more, lifting her gaze to meet Agatha's beautiful blue one, that warm and too-kind smile gingerly gracing her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     She reached up, her palm soft as it cupped Agatha's cheek in an honest adoration. Her thumb brushed tenderly over the arch of her cheekbone for just a moment before she leaned forward, pressing their lips together warmly, fully. She just held it there for a long moment before their lips parted, but their foreheads were still pressed close. Her thumb hadn't stopped making its way across the mindless path on her cheek as the thoughts brewed behind her eyes. There was so much she wanted to say, so much she wanted Agatha to know, and yet? Nothing seemed to form.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, something else blossomed inside of her: A gratitude that she could hardly contain.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Thank you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stole another soft brush of their lips, her own hand raising to brush her knuckles over Rio's cheek. She sat back, her eyes filled with this gentle appreciation, a full understanding that she might not totally understand, but she didn't need to in order to show compassion. Her chin tipped in indication toward the sliding doors of the balcony.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Go,"
     </i>
     she instructed in something bordering on a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was going to listen, but first, she simply sat. Her dark gaze wasn't intense, but it was critical, trying to pick this woman apart. She was trying to see where she was going to break. She was trying to envision however far in the future, just in what way this woman was going to completely crush her. Her palm was still idle on her cheek, though her thumb had since stilled.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then? After three entire days spent together, Rio had no clue how she'd survive any kind of fall out with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Not when she was proving exactly the kind of person she was. Agatha was a rock. She was steadfast and resolute. She was unmovable.
    </p>
<p>
     After another beat, Rio seemed to snap back into the moment, her eyes meeting Agatha's across the small space between them.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll be right back," she offered softly, unable to resist the urge to lean in and steal another quick peck, somehow knowing she was going to need the comfort it was able to offer, something to wrap around her as she headed into the night to have an impossible conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio picked her phone up off of the bed and departed to the balcony, a defeated sigh passing through her lips as she folded into the lounger that was placed there. She glanced at her phone; it was just after midnight, which meant it was around eight back home, albeit the next day.
    </p>
<p>
     She stared at the contact page for her daughter, her mouth suddenly bone dry with the miserable anticipation that had overwhelmed her. There were questions they both needed answers to, though.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could hesitate any longer, she pressed the camera icon as the FaceTime rang in. It only rang twice before the image of Estee's face was full across her screen.
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately, Rio noticed a few things. One: Estee's gorgeous green eyes were red and swollen, indicative that she had been crying. Two: There were faint lines of mascara streaking her cheeks, indicative of just how long she had been crying. Three: She had clearly just gone through the same ritual Rio had, of preparing herself to come face to face with someone she loved enough to try to hide her pain from.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, mija," Rio breathed, her lip quivering involuntarily at the sight. She could suddenly feel this immense ache as it pulsed and radiated through every inch of her being.
    </p>
<p>
     She hated seeing her baby upset.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee wiped at her face again, sniffling in spite of herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "What... what happened, mija?" Rio asked, her voice soft and low, her best attempt at being comforting from thousands of miles away.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee swallowed hard, clearly trying to compose herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... was on a date --" she cut herself off at Rio's expression, shaking her head. "Not now. Later, yes. But... it was a Facebook message request. I haven't even actually opened it, but... I can see what it says."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel the flexing of her throat as it happened, a slow suffocation before she remembered that she could force herself to breathe. She was quiet, waiting for Estee to continue, but she could tell by the way her lips twisted that she was truly unsettled by it all.
    </p>
<p>
     "It said, 'Hey, I'm an old college friend of your mom's. I've been trying to get in touch with her. If you could have her reach out, I'd appreciate it.'" she read, though Rio could see the disgust bleeding onto her features. Estee knew who he was. She was the only one who had known who he was.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio forced down the peach-pit sized ball of anxiety and took a slow, steadying breath.
    </p>
<p>
     "Obviously, I think you should block him. On anything you can find him on. But..." Rio's eyes softened, taking in the disheveled state of her sweet girl. "Mija... tell me what you're thinking."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's eyes lifted, looking somewhere off camera and Rio could see the tears glass them over. At the same time, the bobbing of her throat in her neck signified that she was angry, that she was upset.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sweetheart..." she prodded, but she could do what it was doing, so she fell quiet. She let Estee build her resolve, find the right words she was looking for. Her gaze dropped back to her phone and Rio could still acutely feel the shattering happening in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... Do you think it has to do with the pictures?"
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio's brow knitted together in confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     "Pictures? What pictures?"
    </p>
<p>
     Estee suddenly looked uncomfortable. She was chewing on the inside of her lip nervously, as if physically finding a way to not keep talking.
    </p>
<p>
     "Estee..."
    </p>
<p>
     "I... they turned up this morning, probably around your lunch time."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's brows hiked, a silent prodding.
    </p>
<p>
     "There's... this website. It's called TMZ. It's pretty much a gossip rag."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still clearly not following, not even from the beginning. She was entirely lost, but she was using her judgment to try and understand that this was something Estee was truly struggling with.
    </p>
<p>
     "There's pictures of you and Agatha together. A few of you both on a patio, a couple of you walking down the street holding hands."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had always heard people use the expression 'my stomach fell through the floor' many times in her life, but she had never really understood the depth or gravity of it, not until right then.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mija... I... I'm so sorry," she fumbled, her eyes wide in terror.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama, stop."
    </p>
<p>
     "But I--"
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mama."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio snapped her mouth shut, looking back at her daughter on her phone screen. Estee straightened up a bit, a sudden shift in the air around her.
    </p>
<p>
     "If it does, and he saw them and that made him reach out? Well, fuck him. I mean, fuck him regardless because he's human scum, but he doesn't get that, mama. He doesn't get to take this from you. Which, that brings me to my second point." Estee's brow's hiked, as if to signify that she was about to get serious. "In my twenty-one years on this earth, I have
     <i>
      never,
     </i>
     and I mean
     <i>
      NEVER,
     </i>
     seen you smile like that. In my LIFE!"
    </p>
<p>
     At this, a small smile automatically pulled at her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Really, though. You look...
     <i>
      so
     </i>
     happy. You look like you've gotten a peek at what heaven looks like."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's expression softly as she considered.
    </p>
<p>
     "I just might have."
    </p>
<p>
     They talked for a few moments, the general heaviness of the moment having dissipated the more they spoke. It was hard, sure, but they would get through it. She had even asked, at one point, if Estee wanted her to come home. The response had been a chastising that she was still in school, so it wouldn't really much matter.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward, announcing that she was going to turn in for the night. Before she could get to telling her that she loved her, though, Estee spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama, can I ask you something?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, roo," she breathed, tilting her head slightly in curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     Instantly, Estee's grin spread wide, ear to ear.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can I say hi?"
    </p>
<p>
     A blooming tenderness warmed Rio's cheeks as she gave a gentle nod and stood, carrying the phone inside.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have someone who would like to say hello," she announced softly as she took in the sight of the other woman for a tender beat. She slid onto the bed next to Agatha, who was sitting on her side of the bed -- her side of the bed -- and fit right up next to her. She held the phone up, that shit eating grin still plastered to Estee's face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi! I hear that you're taking good care of my mama," she teased softly, causing Rio to curl into Agatha a little more in mock embarrassment.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm sure trying. It's very nice to unofficially meet you, Estrella," Agatha offered, and Rio felt it. In was instant, a washing of warmth, like running into a heated building on a subzero day. It started in her core, right in her very middle, and it shot out. It touched the end of every nerve she had, not only catching her breath, but stopping her heart for a split second in the process.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't just the fact that Agatha had used her proper name -- absolutely nailing the pronunciation -- it was the the sheer raw tenderness in her tone as she spoke to the most important being in Rio's life. It wasn't forced or fabricated. It was soft, natural. It was the tone of a mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did really just want to say hi, but..." Her gaze shifted from Rio to Agatha, a sweet smile forming on her face. "I'm really glad my mama met you."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could physically feel it as Agatha melted, just the slightest bit, at the compliment.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm pretty glad I met her, too," Agatha offered back tenderly, tilting her head to lay atop Rio's as it rested on her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's eyes shifted back to her mother, that same warm smile still on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Te amo, mama,"
     </i>
     she offered softly.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Te veo, mija. I'll check on you when I get up, yeah?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Sleep in. You deserve it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Before Rio could protest, the video image cut and Rio breathed a soft laugh. All at once, Agatha shifted, pulling her arm out from between them so that she could secure it snugly around Rio's shoulders, her hand rubbing gently at her bicep.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you okay?" Agatha asked her gently.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down at the dark phone in her hands, considering for a moment. She inhaled a slow breath before she picked up her head, looking up at the woman beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     This beautiful, compassionate, extraordinary, sensational woman. This kind-hearted, bright, intelligent woman.
    </p>
<p>
     What on earth had she ever done to be worthy?
    </p>
<p>
     There was a soft flicker in Rio's eyes while she took a moment to gather her courage, the words sitting heavy in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     "I wasn't. But... I am now. It... wasn't awful. Just... him trying to get in touch with me."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had started to fidget with her fingers in her lap, picking nervously at her cuticles.
    </p>
<p>
     "But... she asked me if I thought it was because of the pictures. I had absolutely no clue what in the world she was talking about, obviously. But then..." Rio pressed her lips together, studying Agatha carefully as she continued. "Does TMZ mean anything to you?"
    </p>
<p>
     The question landed immediately, and Rio could see it was like a sucker punch. Agatha's eyes slid shut and she tipped her head back, knocking it against the headboard of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Gods be damned,"
     </i>
     she groaned. She lifted her head again, her gaze sweeping down to Rio's face, a clear apology written there. "I... I am usually
     <i>
      so
     </i>
     good at sussing out the paparazzi. And, as of late, they hadn't really been bothering me. I guess I really failed to take the Oscars buzz into consideration."
    </p>
<p>
     Something formed, though, tugging on just the right muscles, pushing at all the right places on Agatha's face. It was this clear mixture of realization and utter wonder.
    </p>
<p>
     "What?" Rio prodded, her eyes never moving.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was my fault."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha--"
    </p>
<p>
     She shook her head, holding up a finger as if the thought were still forming in her head. Her eyes landed back on Rio's face, though, and there was the tiniest flicker of mischief that faded into something more... soft.
    </p>
<p>
     "I didn't notice because I wasn't looking. I wasn't looking because I have a really hard time looking at much else that isn't you when you're in my immediate vicinity."
    </p>
<p>
     Flattered? Understatement. Smitten? It was a step in the right direction. Infatuation didn't feel like it fit right.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio landed on it, going off like a lightbulb over her head.
    </p>
<p>
     She was so wholly
     <i>
      enamored
     </i>
     with Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you know..." Rio began, reaching up to brush a few light fingertips across the side of Agatha's neck, "that almost every time you have something to say, my heart stops beating so I can hear you clearly?"
    </p>
<p>
     An amused and thoroughly delighted grin split Agatha's lips, her eyes wrinkling at the corners with it's width.
    </p>
<p>
     "That kinda sounds like me when you smile," Agatha countered, raising her eyebrows in playful contest. "The whole breathing thing starts feeling like a sham for a few seconds there."
    </p>
<p>
     There was a gentle, sweet giggle that flittered off of Rio's lips, but she was stuck, so pulled into the way she felt when she basked in those beautiful blue hues. The air around them condensed for the briefest second, almost like there was something unspoken between them, something neither of them were ready to say.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had considered herself to be a sane person through most of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Sitting there, meeting Agatha's reverent gaze?
    </p>
<p>
     She had to be insane, sitting there thinking about how she could have just said it, and actually meant it. She could have just pushed it out and hoped for the best.
    </p>
<p>
     No, she told herself, there would be more time for that. More time that, perhaps, might not make her look so damn insane.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, her hand planted more firmly to the side of Agatha's neck, her fingers curling around into her hairline. With a gentle tug, she pulled her the slightest bit closer so that their lips could meet. It was soft, patient, thankful. It was a show of appreciation for literally every single thing she had done that day.
    </p>
<p>
     How many times was she going to get to kiss her, eyes closed, before she opened them to realize that Agatha had been nothing more than a figment of her imagination?
    </p>
<p>
     The reality of it was that in this life and on this plane, they had known each other a few days.
    </p>
<p>
     In the very far reaches of the essence of who Rio was as a human being? She felt like she'd known Agatha as long as the universe had been in existence. It was this deeply seated familiarity, this rooted feeling that something about their souls, something about their very existences were meant to collide in this world, in this time, but perhaps not for the first time.
    </p>
<p>
     In her grand debate over religion, rebirth was not a theory Rio had ever entertained. However, the longer she sat there, kissing Agatha and feeling her swallow every bit of her sadness and despair, she considered it. This was not their first time knowing one another. It simply couldn't be.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Maybe,
     </i>
     she thought as Agatha pulled back for a soft breath,
     <i>
      I just might believe in soulmates.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's fingertips still lingered on her own cheek, the wonder simply sitting over them, pinning them in the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you want to lay down?" The question was a genuine question, not an invitation. Rio was sure that Agatha was reading every bit of the emotional hangover mixed with her exhaustion as it was so plainly decorating her features.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded her head gently and they moved around just enough to get under the duvet after Agatha shut off the light.
    </p>
<p>
     Like a magnet, Rio gravitated into her side, her head finding a home on Agatha's chest, that soft thump of her heartbeat a steady lifeline beneath Rio's ear.
    </p>
<p>
     The room fell quiet, the TV off this time, and Rio let her eyes fall closed. She could feel the exhaustion in her bones, but she couldn't shut her mind off, couldn't make it stop. She just kept thinking about it, about the way Agatha had reacted to seeing her in distress.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been taking care of herself for an incredibly long time. She couldn't even really lay claim over to having an actual relationship. She had been a lonely woman, but it had always been by choice. She had done what she thought was best, not only to protect Estee, but perhaps to protect herself, too. After all, the brightest light in her life was born out of darkness. People were wicked and cruel. She knew that all too well.
    </p>
<p>
     But then... there was Agatha. Rio had been able to glimpse a few different sides of Agatha over the course of the last couple of days, and what Rio saw? It was a complex piecing together of so many various things. There was that tenacity that Rio adored, then the absolute intelligence that radiated off of her. She was authoritative, undoubtedly from being a woman in a very male-dominated industry, but she also showed gratitude.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, Rio realized, had a very stern understanding of the world, and while she could use it to be stern herself when needed, she also had the knowledge to know when life called for more tender moments.
    </p>
<p>
     She was a complex masterpiece, and Rio was completely of the understanding that she had barely scratched the surface.
    </p>
<p>
     The time had ticked on as her thoughts ran laps around the inside of her skull, and as she became aware of the room around her, she realized that Agatha's heartbeat had softened and her breathing was far more slow and even than it had been.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio squeezed her eyes shut, confident that the other woman was asleep, her soft whisper so quiet that it barely touched her own ears.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm not ready to love you yet, but I think I do already."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     ***
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio's consciousness slipped back into her physical form, she became hyper-aware of something in the entire two seconds it took her to take a breath:
    </p>
<p>
     For the first time in her entire life, Rio had woken up in someone else's arms.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a strong sense of comfort in the snug hold of Agatha's arm wrapped around her middle. She could feel, with almost intense awareness, every single place that Agatha's front was pressed her back, including the way her face was nuzzled into Rio's shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Breaking that moment was absolutely not an option, and so, Rio laid there, just reveling in what it felt to be held by someone, to be
     <i>
      cuddled
     </i>
     by another person. Rio felt safe in the assertion that she had literally never shared a bed with another adult, in her entire adult life, until she had found herself laying next to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't want to find out what it would feel like to lay next to anyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     After a short while, she heard Agatha draw in a breath -- likely the first of consciousness -- and the hold around her middle tightened.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mmmm,"
     </i>
     Agatha hummed into the back of Rio's neck, a truly warm and happy sound, one that touched Rio dead center in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good morning, beautiful," Rio cooed, her own arm draping over Agatha's, her thumb brushing softly over the warm skin there.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do we have to get up?" she questioned in a tired grunt, snuggling in even closer.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean, we don't
     <i>
      have
     </i>
     to, unless you have anywhere to be," Rio answered, her voice light. After a moment, she shifted, turning to roll over in Agatha's arms. Their legs wove together in an act that almost felt too intimate for where they were in the relationship, but the feeling it caused inside of Rio? It felt too good, and she wasn't going to give any credit to those voices in the back of her head that kept insisting she needed to keep herself grounded in reality.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Agatha was her reality now.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a soft air of calm over them, but it was shattered as Agatha sat up, her eyes wild, as if she had just realized something.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pushed herself up, too, looking at Agatha with mild worry and more intense confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's Monday," she hissed, reaching over for her phone to see what time it was. "And I am forty minutes late to a meeting with my casting director." She sighed, moving to type a couple of messages before she tossed the phone on the bed, sighing softly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, crisis averted. She figured when I hadn't texted her by nine thirty that I was likely not going to make it. But..." her eyes swept up to Rio, as if considering. "I do have some paperwork to do when it comes to filing for filming permits. You don't have to, but you can come to the office with me, if you'd like."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could tell just by the look on her face that Agatha knew it wasn't an exciting invitation, but it was still one that she could extend to show that she really was only leaving because she needed to, and not because she wanted any amount of space between them.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can bring a book," Rio suggested, as if that were enough of an answer to the question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you wear reading glasses?" Agatha asked, though Rio did not miss the way she quirked one brow.
    </p>
<p>
     "Regular ones. But I keep contacts in about ninety eight percent of the time," she admitted with a soft laugh. "But I have them, if you'd prefer I wear them," she teased, a small wrinkle forming in her nose as she scrunched her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Let me see them," Agatha beguiled, her eyes dancing with an excited light.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio heaved a sigh and removed herself from the bed, making her way over to her bag so that she could rummage through it, pulling out her glasses case. She snapped it open and removed them, sliding them onto her face before she lifted her head. She couldn't see anything through the double prescription, but it accomplished the task she had set out to do. The frames were thick, but not too thick, and a marbled blue all the way around. They weren't completely square, but they fit Rio's face perfectly.
    </p>
<p>
     She could hear it from across the space between them, that sharp intake of air as Agatha's bottom lip was pulled between her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     "Verdict?" Rio posed innocently, reaching up to slide them off, her gaze casting back up to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Contacts out. All of the time. Don't ever wear a single contact again," Agatha nearly gushed, the adoration clear in the look she was wearing. Her laughter was such a sweet sound, but Rio knew she was, in fact, being very serious.
    </p>
<p>
     "Glasses it is, then," she mused.
    </p>
<p>
     They busied themselves with getting ready for the day -- which had come to include Rio taking her contacts out -- and had regrouped a few minutes later as Agatha called for the car.
    </p>
<p>
     That softly flickering affection seemed to follow them everywhere they went, as long as they were together. Even as they spent a small chunk of the afternoon in Agatha's office, Rio lounging on the sofa with a book propped on her knees, she had the stunning realization that there was literally nowhere else in the world she would have rather been.
    </p>
<p>
     She had caught it -- a couple of times -- the way Agatha kept staring. Rio would glance up for the briefest moment to see Agatha scribbling at the papers in front of her and then turn her eyes back to her book, only to feel a gentle heat creep over her skin. Her gaze would flicker, ever so slightly, as it met Agatha's for a brief second and the other woman shyly diverted her gaze, though the smiles that curled both of their mouths at the same time matched in perfect harmony.
    </p>
<p>
     The sun was still shining, but Rio could tell that it had started sink the slightest bit in the sky, an indicator that sunset was approaching.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm almost finished, here. You ready to blow out of here?" Agatha asked from behind her desk and Rio perked up a bit, looking across the room at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course."
    </p>
<p>
     "I have to admit, I'm not quite so ready to give up the view of you on that couch, with that book, in those damn glasses."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's cheeks flushed with the flattery, her eyes diverting only for a moment before they flickered back up, taking Agatha in.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can read in the hotel, too," she mused back, sitting up a little more.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned forward, resting her chin on her the backs of her hands, her elbows on the desk. There was that soft reverence again, that measured intake of all that she saw before her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      She's looking through me again.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "There's somewhere I'd like to take you, first." Her words were so sure, so decisive. She knew that she could write the entire playbook and Rio would follow it to a t. She had to know.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do I get to know where?" Rio posed curiously, closing her book. She rested it atop her thighs, leaning forward in interest.
    </p>
<p>
     "Somewhere on the beach," Agatha offered back vaguely, though a sly smile played at her lips. There was very obviously something she was failing to include, but this mysterious side of her seemed to suit her well.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, then. I suppose we have somewhere to be."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's entire demeanor had shifted upon Rio's agreement; she was even lighter, bubbling with something that, if Rio had to name it, seemed pretty close to complete excitement.
    </p>
<p>
     Most of the car ride up the coast was filled with Rio asking probing questions, trying to deduce what it was that Agatha had up her sleeve, but Agatha remained tight-lipped, though her laughter at Rio's often outlandish guesses was unrivaled in the sound of its pure joy.
    </p>
<p>
     After about forty minutes, the car turned into a large lot, the beach opening out in its expanse on the other side. Rio eyed Agatha with a sizzling curiosity, something that was nearly crackling just above her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     With ease, Agatha slid out and offered her hand to Rio, who took it happily and filed out behind her. Her questions had subsided, now that she realized that she was on the verge of getting the answers she had been asking for. She let Agatha guide them, pulling her down to the sand and around a bend of trees that jutted out, obscuring the view Rio now took in.
    </p>
<p>
     There were about eight horses being tended to or drinking water out of a trough, their lead lines slung around a long wooden hitching post. There were saddles slung over a smaller stand in varying sizes, some laying on the ground in front of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes widened in surprise as she fully digested the sight before her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha... I can't ride a horse."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha waved a hand, a sweetly dismissive gesture. "I wasn't banking on you being able to. I can. So you'll saddle with me."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at her, clearly stunned. She took just a moment before she finally found her words.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Are you literally asking me to go on a horseback ride with you at sunset?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The pride settled on Agatha like a warm coat, hugging all the right places. That grin she was wearing? In the light of the now-setting sun, it stole Rio's breath right off of her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "And if I am?" Agatha posed. "Are you really going to tell me no?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio softened in her entirety, a raw moment of honesty slipping through the cracks.
    </p>
<p>
     "Honestly, Agatha? I'm not sure there's much you could ever ask of me that I would say no to."

<p>
     Rio liked to read. That was about as much of a natural fact of order as stating the sky was blue. She read a lot. She read everything. She could immerse herself in every type of fiction with ease, but a lot of non-fiction seemed to pique her interest as well. She had books upon books about different plants and how to care for them back home, something she had indicated to her neighbor when she had left, and the other woman had agreed to tend to the ones she had.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had read many romance novels in her time and yet, as her head turned, those burning green eyes casting out on the dancing lights of that setting orange sun, the jolting feel of the horse beneath her? Her arms tightened a bit subconsciously around Agatha's middle, holding herself the slightest bit closer. She had no qualms about falling off, but this was something she wanted to be
     <i>
      close
     </i>
     to Agatha for.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been able to tell instantly, the moment she had started laughing as the horse began to move, that Agatha was enraptured, that she was hanging on literally every single moment of the exchange like it was her whole reason for being. There hadn't been a time yet, since they had left that alcove, where Rio had not caught sight of Agatha's profile as she glanced over at any time when it was lacking a positively elated smile.
    </p>
<p>
     She was stuck in that feeling of being in-between worlds, a feeling that she'd not had in quite some time. A feeling that had felt nothing like
     <i>
      this
     </i>
     did. This sense of dissociation was brought on by the fact that in less than 72 hours, her entire life had become something she had not recognized. In less than three short days, almost everything she had held solid convictions about in life was suddenly out the window.
    </p>
<p>
     A week ago, Rio Vidal would have insisted with absolute authority that she would never be the kind of woman to fall in love. Life had been too fickle to her, had taken too much, and she was resolved in needing no one else. Romance was always a fond thought, but she was a realist in a world filled with dreamers.
    </p>
<p>
     At least, she used to be.
    </p>
<p>
     She was there, right there, ultra-aware of every movement of the beast beneath her, every breath that the woman in front of her took. She was acutely aware that if she moved her hand just a few inches, she would have the firm and steady beating of Agatha's heart right beneath her palm.
    </p>
<p>
     There, she could feel it. She could feel the confirmation that if she was spinning into insanity? That thumping proved to her that she wasn't alone. That rhythm was becoming a familiar drumline, a steady echo of the beating in her own chest.
    </p>
<p>
     That thin line of connection seemed to glow hotter as Rio held on, immeasurably moved by the sight of the sun as it sank with finality into the ocean.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha clicked her tongue, her heels giving a gentle squeeze into the side of the horse, causing its gait to slow to a gentle stroll. For the first time, Rio managed to tear her eyes away from the horizon to see where it was they had arrived.
    </p>
<p>
     She blinked; it was a dead end, a jetty of dark slate stone that erupted and shot every which direction.
    </p>
<p>
     The horse moseyed toward the brush, a very obvious hitching post sticking out of the ground. It was like muscle memory for him, it seemed. Agatha adjusted slightly in the saddle, reaching down with one hand to give Rio's arm a light pat to signify that it was okay to release her hold. Rio obliged, her arms loosening before they dropped. With ease, Agatha slid out of the saddle, her feet hitting the sand beneath her soundlessly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze cast down, taking in the sight of that woman there beneath here, looking up at her like she might as well have been that sun, been that one setting in the sky. In a gesture that was becoming commonplace Agatha behavior, her hand raised, waiting for Rio's so that she could help her off of the horse and they could trek a little further.
    </p>
<p>
     Without a moment's hesitation, that familiar meeting of their palms happened and she succumbed to the warmth it had to offer. She shifted, swinging her leg over so that she could drop down, landing on both feet as she swooned slightly into Agatha, who wrapped her up in an embrace as if it were completely natural.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio realized something, her gaze casting around before it landed back on Agatha, illuminated in the most stunning orange lights from the reflection of the sun on the water. They were alone.
    </p>
<p>
     "What are we doing here?" Rio probed curiously, her arms wrapped around Agatha's neck as she looked up at her, beholding her with that smoldering adoration.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're not 'here' yet," Agatha divulged, the smallest sparkle of excitement flickering in those gorgeous blue pools. She gave Rio's hand a light squeeze at the precise moment she leaned in to steal the briefest kiss. Her hold on Rio concurrently released and she stepped back so that she could begin to lead the way on the rest of their short trek.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes swept, filled with a quiet curiosity as she let Agatha pull her along, toward those rocks. The closer they got, the better she could see it. There was a path, a little winding of flattened stone that lifted up the scape of rocks on one side.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm glad you're wearing sensible shoes," Agatha offered with a soft laugh as they began the small hike. It only took a moment to reach the precipice, a peak that mounted in the middle of a large break in the stone, and it was followed immediately by a six step descent.
    </p>
<p>
     They hit the sand, and for a moment, Rio was still so struck by the wonder she felt when she looked at Agatha that she did not think to survey their surroundings.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes slowly tore from Agatha's smile to take in where they actually were.
    </p>
<p>
     That wall of rock that they had passed through tangled out toward the ocean, curving in before them in some sort of haphazard cave. The angle of the light from the mouth of the cave poured in at just the right angle, in just the right way that caused the reflections to dance on the overhead slate like an endless sparkling of thousands of diamonds.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was completely taken. This was a secret. This was something Agatha kept close to the vest. It was something she was choosing to share with Rio, not only because Rio had indirectly asked, but, she sensed, because Agatha had been waiting for this moment for some time.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't have to say it, but Rio saw it. It was that unmentioned shield that Rio could always see, hanging braced on Agatha's arm, invisible by her side. She had gathered that although she had received nothing but the most gentle demeanor from Agatha since the moment they had met, she had faired through her own hells and was ready, at any given moment, to throw that shield up and keep the world out.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was thankful, really, that she hadn't tried to keep her out.
    </p>
<p>
     She would have had every reason. That afternoon in front of her office could have gone a very different way if Agatha had chosen, in that moment, to protect herself instead of embracing the endless wild of fate, instead of choosing to trust Rio to not hurt her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was an understanding person, and if she had not been in the position they were in, she could not say with any predetermined amount of certainty that she would have trusted someone who was in the position she now stood resolute in.
    </p>
<p>
     Nothing in Rio wanted to see anything out of Agatha other than joy and light, happiness and exhilaration. She was not foolish enough to think that, if somehow this managed to pan out, they would never know struggle in their lives, but there was some thread of comfort to be found in the idea that maybe it was something neither of them would have to shoulder alone.
    </p>
<p>
     She was getting ahead of herself again.
    </p>
<p>
     Tuning back into the moment, her gaze landed into that burning hot stare, a shimmering of pure... unadulterated... merriment. Her arms were snug around Agatha's neck, and their chests brushed just noticeably.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's own chest tightened in a way she couldn't ignore, and she realized that it was because she had stopped breathing the moment their eyes had met. She exhaled the breath she had been holding, her fingers rolling a few strands of Agatha's hair, placed at the base of her neck, between them.
    </p>
<p>
     They were so close that Rio could have kissed her, but there was something more in the moment. It was weighted, but it was comfortable, form fitting to the moment. Her lips worried together for a moment as she debated what it was she wanted so badly to say, so badly that she could feel it boiling in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, as she picked up the thread of where she wanted to go, she began to pull, not realizing that as she did so, the long thread wound around and out of sight, swinging behind her, weaving into who she was as a woman.
    </p>
<p>
     A tug, the loosening of her own threads, just beyond her own comprehension, done by herself.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I want to tell you something that's going to make me sound like a really sad and pathetic person, and if you become of the immediate opinion that you should need to head for the hills, it would be completely understood."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The curiosity in Agatha's gaze was gentle, her eyes soft as she understood the weight of what she was being offered. She gave a slight tip of her head, a silent encouragement for Rio to continue.
    </p>
<p>
     Those few strands of hair felt so smooth as she focused on rolling them between her thumb and forefinger, grounding her in the moment. It tethered her solidly to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I have never been in a relationship. I've... I mean, I had my fun in college, but... when life happens at nineteen, you just kind of become disinterested."
     </i>
     Rio's throat bobbed with nerves, her gaze having fallen to just over Agatha's shoulder, and attempt to keep some form of control, and to shy away from the feeling like Agatha was looking directly into her again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hell, the last time I even slept with a woman, I was in my first year of uni. Christ."
     </i>
     A nervous laugh escaped her lips, and she had turned her gaze even more, an additional shifting of her head. She felt it all at once, though, that light hold on her chin that dragged her right back into the abyss of warmth and comfort that was Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "You can keep going. It's okay. It's just you and me," she encouraged, her hand moving just enough so that she could cradle Rio's jaw in her palm.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes took her in, so close, so warm, so gentle.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I have been alone the entirety of my adult life. And I have always been okay with that. The thought of being inexperienced in bed, or not knowing how to properly operate in any kind of romantic entanglement? Well, they were enough to remind me why I was so steadfast in my want -- no, my need -- to be alone."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's lips twisted uncertainly, her eyes flickering over the entire landscape of Agatha's face, trying to read what her response was going to be.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "For over twenty years, I have been at peace with the fact that Estrella is my entire world. I have faired just fine, every night for the entirety of that time, falling asleep and waking up alone. But... for the first time in my life, I woke up this morning to being held... held by you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There was this wave that washed over Rio's face; it was a flash of warmth, but it was tinged by something else, by a sense of fear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And I... I'm already dreading the moment when we decide it's best for me to go back home."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The shift in Agatha was visible, almost tangible. For as squared and strong as Agatha's posture always was, it was clear that something had softened her immensely. Her hands lifted from the homes they had settled into on Rio's sides, so gentle and careful in their movements as she cupped either side of Rio's jaws.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned in, their faces close, but she stilled, her eyes fluttering shut. Her thumb swiped a soft line along Rio's cheek and she pressed their foreheads together, a soft sound escaping her, something that tried hard in its efforts to be a laugh, but did not quite make it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I just got you,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed at her in a heavy whisper, the way her head moved as she spoke causing their lips to brush, just barely, with her words.
     <i>
      "Don't make me think about having to let you go, yet."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was a soft plea, and yet, it boomed like cannons in the night.
    </p>
<p>
     For as deep into this as Rio knew she had become, she still had these moments of wonder where she was hit with the weight of the realization that the feelings between them? It wasn't some fabrication, some willing of her own desires. It was mutual. It was a give and take, a solid foundation if they truly did have hopes of finding a way to build something a little more sustainable.
    </p>
<p>
     Their faces hung like that, so close that she could almost taste Agatha's breath, sweet with the remnants of the tea she had been drinking in her office.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I could kiss you until my lungs explode, you know?"
     </i>
     Rio offered softly, keeping hold so that as she spoke, that brushing happened again, her eyes boring daringly close into Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grin was instant, her thumbs brushing over Rio's cheeks tenderly again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Give the arm a good ol' double tap when you're getting to that point and I'll give you a breather, hm?"
     </i>
     Agatha coaxed in a low, sultry murmur.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could even think about forming any kind of response, the swell of Agatha's tide washed in, their lips meeting in a tender display of affection. It felt like her legs had been swept out from beneath her. It always felt like that, every single time Agatha kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     Her grip tightened a bit around Agatha's neck, pulling her closer, kissing her a little harder.
    </p>
<p>
     Her life was a literal fucking fairytale. They stood there, in the middle of that little cavern as the diamonds of the setting sun sparkled on every surface around them, the water clear and cool at their feet. There they stood, kissing each other like it was the
     <i>
      only single fact
     </i>
     in the universe that made absolutely any sense. They just...
     <i>
      were,
     </i>
     in that moment.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the world? Gone.
    </p>
<p>
     The thoughts about what had happened the night before? Carried away by the gusts of wind that whipped wildly whenever Hurricane Agatha blew in.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was the most beautiful storm Rio had ever stared in the eye.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a silent pang in Rio's chest, a pang of wanting.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      What I would give to feel her thunder in my teeth, to be lit up by every bolt of lightning she could strike me with.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Breathless, they parted, instant and warm smiles reflecting as they peered across that small space at one another.
    </p>
<p>
     "We should probably head back before it's completely dark," Agatha suggested, reaching up with a tender hand to tuck a strand of hair behind Rio's ear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a nod, though she was quick in stealing one more soft, fast kiss. They turned and made their way out of the cove to the awaiting horse, who's gentle trot carried them back to the section of the beach where they had been dropped off. As she unseated from the horse and Agatha turned to take care of everything else, Rio found herself wandering just slightly, soft footfalls carrying her a little further toward the water.
    </p>
<p>
     How was any of this real? How had it happened that not only had she somehow lunged into this whirlwind romance, but that she had seemingly found the most ideal partner to do so with in the entire world? This dance was a carefully executed one; while it was a flurry of mostly positive emotions, Rio knew that this was going to take thought, and problem solving if they hoped to lay any kind of foundation for a future.
    </p>
<p>
     Was that what Agatha would want? Before she could cynically provide her own answer to that question, though, she felt a pair of arms snake around her waist, securing around her firmly. The scent of Agatha's shampoo was strong and immediate as she felt the other woman rest her chin on her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Admiring the view?"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured softly, tilting her head forward so that she could place a soft kiss to the seam of Rio's shirt on her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio breathed a soft chuckle, her head turning just enough so that she could nuzzle into Agatha's hair.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Holding an existential debate, actually,"
     </i>
     Rio corrected playfully. She could feel Agatha shift slightly behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah? About what?" she asked curiously.
    </p>
<p>
     An amused smile curved Rio's lips and she closed her eyes, breathing in that scent of vanilla and lavender, that scent that had become so familiar to her in the last few days.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "About how to identify deities."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mmmm,"
     </i>
     Agatha hummed in thought, a warm delight buzzing in her tone.
     <i>
      "Thinking about subscribing to a new religion?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "That depends. Where's your temple of worship?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The question landed exactly how Rio had intended it, though there were layers to such an response, ones she could really break down and dissect if Agatha asked her to, but not right then.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then? Rio was acutely aware of the sharp draw of breath by her ear and the subtle tightening of Agatha's arms around her middle. Her face turned and Rio instantly felt the warmth of her face as Agatha tucked it into the crook of her neck, holding her there firmly, steadily.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Stop that,"
     </i>
     Agatha chastised in a low murmur, almost a growl, something that reached into the depths of who Rio was and struck a match.
    </p>
<p>
     She hummed an inquisitorial response, and after a moment, Agatha lifted her head to respond.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're trying to mess up my plans,"
     </i>
     she purred into Rio's ear, gracing it with a barely there brush of her lips that sent goosebumps cascading onto every single inch of her skin.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I was unaware of such plans. How could I be trying to mess them up?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's hold on her relinquished, and for a moment she found herself disappointed, but the turnaround was relatively fast as Agatha's hands found her hips and physically turned her around. One arm looped around her waist, pulling her in close, their faces a mere breath away.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You, Rio Vidal, have messed up my plans since the moment you whistled at me from across the water. You don't have to actually try."
     </i>
     A flicker of light danced in Agatha's eyes and she tilted her head affectionately at the woman before her.
     <i>
      "But I am starting to realize that I might not know how to go back to a life without the controlled chaos you're able to bring."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was stunned, moved to a choked emotion that she could not immediately identify, by what Agatha was telling her. It was heavy, but it was a direct reflection of the feelings that had been bubbling, churning in her own chest.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to say something, to somehow pour out of her every emotion that was only growing within her. She wanted to name it, to call it what it was, but that sense of sanity was still holding her back. There would be time. They would have more time. As she faltered, though, she realized that the words? They wouldn't cut it this time.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hand raised, a tentative touch light on Agatha's cheek that caused her eyes to slide shut in bliss. The tips of her fingers seemed to glide over her skin, up over her temple and back down. She curled them into the little give of flesh at the corner of Agatha's jaw, a gentle and quiet beckoning.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha answered with the slightest lean, their lips meeting, a firm pressure but nothing too intense. It was a full kiss, but there was something... different about it. There was gravity, this time. There was this undeniable pull, grounding the two of them in that moment, their feet in the soft sand. It was this firm hold, this grip around them, as though the universe was breathing an acknowledgement over them:
     <i>
      You belong together.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The sweet lip lock illuminated by the dying lights of the setting sun lasted only a few moments, but to Rio? She had been there since the dawn of time, on that beach, kissing Agatha like it was the only way she could ever survive. They parted, that tender reverence settling gentle between the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "The car should be here,"
     </i>
     Agatha whispered, words Rio could almost taste with their closeness. She gave a gentle nod and relinquished her hold on the other woman, but the space of their parting was filled immediately with the joining of their hands. Slowly, the climbed their way up the beach to the awaiting car.
    </p>
<p>
     The ease with which Rio seemed to slide into Agatha's side, fitting like a puzzle piece, should have been startling, or maybe even a little worrisome. At this point, though? What valid worries were there for her to have when it came to Agatha? Her head rested on the front of Agatha's shoulder as the car bumped along the highway back toward the city. Agatha's free hand was flipping through something on her phone, but otherwise, all was still.
    </p>
<p>
     They sat in that quiet veneration, simply absorbing the weight of the day. Rio lifted the frame of her glasses so that she could rub at her eye, and she could both hear and feel as Agatha exhaled a gentle chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't fall asleep on me, yet. We're not quite done."
    </p>
<p>
     This piqued Rio's interest and she sat up a little more, her eyes casting out the window. She did not see anything familiar, anything she might recognize as being at least close to the hotel. Not for a moment, anyway. The car rolled to a stop at the curb and Rio realized that they were back to where they had started; Agatha's office.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's brow knit slightly in confusion, the question clear in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "C'mon," she urged with a gentle nudge. She slid out and, as always, held a hand to help Rio out, too.
    </p>
<p>
     She led them back up those stairs, swiping her keycard as the door unlocked. There were fluorescent lights hanging in the immediate foyer and the security guard on duty -- a different one than the one Rio had surely shocked the hell out of -- lifted his head at their entrance.
    </p>
<p>
     "Evening, Ms. Harkness. It just arrived a few minutes ago," He voiced, nodding his head to the cardboard box that sat on the corner of the lifted part of his desk. Agatha swiped it with a smile, thanking him warmly as she gave a tug on Rio's hand, pulling her toward the elevators.
    </p>
<p>
     Noting she had her hands full, Rio pressed the call button and turned to take Agatha in as she stood, her head tilted up, her eyes lingering in feigned interest on the number that changed above the doors. She was clearly avoiding looking at Rio; that much was obvious by that upward curve of her lips, as if she were brewing something.
    </p>
<p>
     The doors opened and they slid inside, Rio moving to press the same button she had seen Agatha press that morning.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, no. Top floor."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head toward her, an undeniable sparkle of curiosity rippling through her expression.
    </p>
<p>
     "When did you have time to order a pizza?" she asked first, unable to keep the laughter from taking her over.
    </p>
<p>
     "On the way here. It had suddenly dawned on me that we haven't eaten much today. I hope you're okay with bacon and mushroom."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's grin was still plastered to her lips, this overwhelming affection completely drowning her as she watched that woman, regarded her with this absolute astonishment.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, but really... how do you
     <i>
      do
     </i>
     that?" Rio asked, and while there was an air of lightness in her question, it was a legitimate question, she felt.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll let you know when I figure it out."
    </p>
<p>
     That answer, there was more than one layer to that. It wasn't just flirty banter, not with that slight shadowing of her gaze, as if Agatha genuinely had no idea how even she was capable of such things.
    </p>
<p>
     The unspoken truth: She already knew without having to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     The elevator gave a soft
     <i>
      ding
     </i>
     and the doors pulled open to a dark floor. Agatha gave a gentle tug on her hand, pulling her to the left.
    </p>
<p>
     "This way."
    </p>
<p>
     There was this crackling of excitement in her chest. Agatha was so damn mysterious, moved about the world with this enigmatic presence that often left Rio guessing. Agatha stopped them in front of a doorway marked with signage to indicated that there were stairs on the other side of it.
    </p>
<p>
     A brow quirked as Rio turned, eyeing Agatha skeptically.
    </p>
<p>
     "Up we go!" she insisted, not even sneaking to see the way Rio was looking at her. Rio pulled the door open and Agatha led them up, kicking the door open at the top. It swung open into the warm breeze of the night and she pulled Rio out behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha!" Rio squealed, the wind whipping her hair around. "What are we doing up here?"
    </p>
<p>
     "This is it," she stated simply, as if that was enough of an explanation.
    </p>
<p>
     "This is what?" Rio questioned back, clearly not catching on.
    </p>
<p>
     "This is my
     <i>
      favorite
     </i>
     part of the city. Come." She gave another light tug, pulling Rio across the rooftop toward the nearest edge of the building. The ledge was a good four feet in width, but Rio's eyes lifted above the concrete lip of the building.
    </p>
<p>
     What she saw?
    </p>
<p>
     She was breathless, her free hand flying to her chest, as if it would catch the breath that had escaped her.
    </p>
<p>
     All of Los Angeles was splayed out in front of them like a miniature model, something someone had spent hundreds of hours putting painstaking detail into. There were thousands of lights speckled across the expanse, some flickering in and out of brightness. The buildings were nothing more than craggy extensions of rock, jutting up into the night sky in their nightly shadows.
    </p>
<p>
     She could faintly hear it, the buzz and bustle of the street below them.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Up here, I can see it all. Up here, I realize my place in the world. Or... I thought I had."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She set the pizza box on the ledge and pulled Rio into her, leaning her cheek against the top of her head.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Something I am beginning to realize with a thrilling sense of terror... is that my place in the world might not have been where I thought it always was."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio moved slightly, enough to cause Agatha to lift her head, and enough to meet her eye to eye, a silent probing unfolding in her gaze.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Something in the very core of me is telling me that my place in the world... is right next to you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There it was, the tipping point. Rio was now no longer veering on the edge of safe. She was rolled, capsized, and every bit of the depth that was Agatha Harkness was pulling her into its comfort, its warmth.
    </p>
<p>
     At this point, Rio was okay with the idea of drowning in it.

<p>
     The turning of the world, it seemed to stop around the two women on that rooftop. Time stood still in the moments it took them to sit on that ledge, the entire city splayed out before them like the majesty it was, and eat their pizza. They had held a light back and forth, but something about the heaviness of where they sat seemed to keep them in a quiet amazement.
    </p>
<p>
     For Rio, the wonder came from getting to experience brand new things, and with someone who clearly loved every bit of what was being shown. It came from getting to see the city through the eyes of someone who claimed it as their own, someone who had a distinct vantage point. Those little parts and pieces of Agatha were shining through, digging their way into every crevice and fold of Rio's brain.
    </p>
<p>
     For Agatha? Rio didn't need to ask her where her sense of wonder came from. She could see it in the way Agatha looked at her. She was the wonder. Rio Vidal was someone else's wonder.
    </p>
<p>
     As they finished eating, Agatha had set the box aside and gave an encouraging pat to the space in front of her. For only a moment, question flashed through Rio's eyes, but then she understood.
    </p>
<p>
     She shifted off the ledge and stood, doing a one-eighty so that she could place herself in front of Agatha, who had one leg off the ledge and one tucked beneath her. Rio mirrored her stance and sat, scooting back just slightly so that she could be closer. That familiar hold seated itself around her middle again and her eyes slid shut in quiet bliss, a content sigh passing through her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     They had sat like that for a little while, the breeze of the night blowing over them. It felt like they were just a fixture, there, nothing more than a monument of what chasing potential could actually look like.
    </p>
<p>
     There was this tick, Rio had noticed, that sometimes surfaced in more idle moments. She had not noticed it much before, but in that moment, she could feel the realization tether itself to each past moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed.
    </p>
<p>
     It was always incredibly soft, almost entirely undetected, but it was just the quietest melody. If Rio had to put a name to it, it was a way to ground herself, to lock the weight of a moment into memory.
    </p>
<p>
     Another few moments had passed, but she felt Agatha shiver behind her. Rio had not even realized how much the temperature had dropped, simply because she had felt so warm in Agatha's arms. She sat up a little, giving Agatha's arm a light squeeze. She turned enough to face her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Let's get you inside. You're cold," Rio acknowledged, though there was a flicker of light in her eyes that said she knew Agatha was going to protest, and that she really didn't need to.
    </p>
<p>
     The battle was there, and Agatha clearly wanted to say something, but Rio could see that she'd caught it, that look in her own eyes. But then, something else settled over her, the tension easing out of each muscle in her face. The flash Rio saw in those blue hues, even in the darkness of night?
    </p>
<p>
     It felt like lava had settled in her stomach. Somehow, it got even hotter when Agatha spoke.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So I suppose the onus is on you, then, to find a way to warm me up."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That heat? That boiling, churning flash of almost unbearable warmth? It ripped through Rio like a brush fire. She could feel the electricity crackling on her skin, and was painfully aware of the dull thudding right in her core. Her breath caught for a moment, but she forced herself back into awareness, into not letting Agatha see how much that had gotten to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she smoothly raised both brows, leaning toward Agatha a bit more.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I can think of a couple,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed back, but before she could think to say or do anything else, Agatha's lips were on her in a hot, flush kiss that rolled the searing red blush up Rio's neck and onto her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     They parted after only a moment, but as they did, and Rio caught Agatha's eye? There was a burning hunger there, something she had not seen before. It wasn't vicious, but it looked almost insatiable.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Let's go,"
     </i>
     Rio coaxed in a whisper, giving a light tap with two fingers to Agatha's cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a disgruntled groan and gathered their things so that they could depart. As was custom, the car was waiting for them when they approached the curb outside, and the ride back to the hotel was short, but something about it was different.
    </p>
<p>
     There was this charged air in the car, this crackling of tiny bolts everywhere in the air, especially with the way they sat, Agatha's hand firmly on Rio's thigh, and Rio's fingers wrapped around it.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they were pouring to the hotel, Rio was nearly choking on the tension that was between them. It wasn't distressing, but it was something that couldn't be ignored. It even sat heavy in the elevator, though they stood close, Agatha's protective grasp tightly around her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     She could almost hear it, the pounding of the other woman's heart, the way it was nearly begging to beat out of her chest. It seemed to hammer right in time with her own.
    </p>
<p>
     They slipped into the room and Rio crossed it to put her phone on the charger, knowing that she did need to call Estee at some point the next day. As she turned around, though, Agatha's back was to her, and she was walking away.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm going to shower really quickly," she offered, though there was this sweet dripping to her tone, an alluring choice that intrigued Rio. Agatha's head turned slightly, so that her chin was over her shoulder and her eyes cast across the room, pinning Rio in an instant. The silence hung steadily, but Rio still heard it without Agatha making a sound.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      You're more than welcome to join me.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In that moment, as Agatha continued her journey to the bathroom, Rio froze.
    </p>
<p>
     This was it.
    </p>
<p>
     This was the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     It was time to make a choice.
    </p>
<p>
     Option one was as followed; she could stand there and stay stuck in her inadequacies and nerves, worrying that she would be a bad lay, or a poor lover. She could stew on the fact that she had given up every bit of her autonomy to protect herself as a result of something that had happened to her when she was still just a teenager.
    </p>
<p>
     Or, there was option two. She could muster up her courage and understand from the vantage point the last 72 hours had given her that there was probably very little she could do that was going to push Agatha away. Wasn't all of this happening because she had decided on the most extreme measures and had flown over an ocean to track down someone who didn't even know her name? Did she really think that Agatha was going to up and leave if she was nervous, or cautious about a new, intimate side to what they were establishing?
    </p>
<p>
     The answer, she realized, was waiting on the other side of that cracked bathroom door.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips twisted, teeth digging on the flesh of the inside as that silent war waged within her. And then, before she could give it another single thought, she reached down and grabbed the hem of her own shirt in both hands, swiftly pulling it over her head. Her hand reached back and undid the fasten of her bra, both garments falling soundlessly to the floor. She stepped forward and unfasted the button on her jeans, pushing those down, along with her underwear, leaving her bare in the middle of the hotel room.
    </p>
<p>
     With nervously cautious footsteps, she padded across the carpet, pushing the door to the bathroom open without a sound.
    </p>
<p>
     She could hear it again, the humming. It caused her heart to thud just a little harder as her footfalls fell across the grey tile.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes cast toward the frosted glass, the silhouette of a naked Agatha broadcasting bright in the lights above for her to behold, to cherish. What was on the other side of those doors? For Rio, she was beginning to wonder if it was everything, all at once.
    </p>
<p>
     A somehow steady hand raised and her fingertips grazed the metal handle on the door, the apprehension stilling her for just a moment. And then, the door moved.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been so focused on herself, on her own intent that she had almost forgotten that there was someone else in the room.
    </p>
<p>
     The door slid open, a roll of steam billowing out into the room as the noise of the shower got a touch louder. Rio's eyes were fixed on her own hand for a beat too long, as if she was not understanding what had happened, but then they lifted.
    </p>
<p>
     What she saw?
    </p>
<p>
     If she didn't pass out in the forthcoming five seconds, it would be a miracle.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't breathing, and the echo of her heartbeat was silent. Everything inside of her was seized up in complete and utter astonishment. Was that even a strong enough word? Her eyes took their time, drinking Agatha inch by inch.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hair was wet, a few strands falling over perfectly set collarbones that poked out in all of the right places. She had a dusting of freckles that coated the tops of her shoulders, spilling down just slightly toward her chest. There was a scar, halfway between her right collarbone and the breast beneath it, and Rio made a mental note to inquire about it later. Her gaze dropped lower, devouring every inch of her, tracing each gentle curve of her breasts, the way her nipples were firm at attention. She had a random freckle here or there on each, little stars of the constellation that she was. Her core was toned, the little ripples of muscles made especially visible by the way the water hugged them. The curves of her hips housed her core, and those toned legs somehow looked even better, glistening like that in the light of that bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had not been wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was a goddess.
    </p>
<p>
     And she deserved to be worshipped.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes finally lifted, and again, her breath was stripped from her lungs. Agatha was looking at her,
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     looking at her, and that ravenous look in her eyes? It gripped hard at Rio's middle. She wanted to feel shy, wanted to say this had been a bad idea, but how could she, when Agatha was consuming her with just a look? As Agatha's own eyes met Rio's though, her expression shifted, softened. She could see that tension, the worry, as Rio hovered by the lip of the shower.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, like the most reliable fact in the universe, it was right in front of her again. Agatha's hand as it crossed the threshold of the shower.
    </p>
<p>
     Without question, Rio reached down and slid their palms together, letting Agatha tug her inside. The water was hot, and it felt good as it dotted her skin, but it didn't feel nearly as good as the way Agatha's hands slid on her hips from behind, her lips finding a home on the side of Rio's head.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm glad you decided to join me,"
     </i>
     she purred softly into her hair, giving her hips the faintest of squeezes. However, that was as far as it went.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's movements were so fluid as she turned, pumping shampoo into her hand. She rubbed both together and reached forward, working it into Rio's now wet hair. It was a gentle caress, just massaging the soap into her scalp with a careful and gentle precision.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could have died, right in that moment, and she would have been the happiest she had ever been in her life. Feeling Agatha's touch, from the way she worked her scalp, to the way she moved onto her next task of soaping Rio down, leaving her on the verge of combustion the entire time.
    </p>
<p>
     Her touch was so gentle, but it had presence, as if to say
     <i>
      I'm here, but you're precious.
     </i>
     It was firm in its duty, but it was obvious that there was amazement in the intent behind it. She was feeling her out, learning her by every curve, every flex of muscle. Agatha was becoming versed in everything that Rio was, and had ever been.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the most intimate Rio had ever been with another human being in her entire life, and it wasn't even inherently sexual, at least at that point. It was being exposed in front of someone that was trusted enough not to abuse it. It was being laid bare in front of another person, one that had already spent so much time looking straight into her. Agatha could see all of her, now, and instead of choosing to run, she stood there, bathing Rio in every last bit of attention she had to offer.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned to face Agatha, her palms laying flatly on her chest as she looked up at her, those bright lights dancing in her emerald eyes. She could see it, right in front of her, even though it was a logistical nightmare: It was her future.
    </p>
<p>
     It was her turn, which she silently acknowledged by reaching over Agatha's shoulder for the shampoo. As they stood there, Rio's fingers tangled in Agatha's wet hair, Rio watched with an insatiable swelling as the other woman's eyes slid shut and the sheer bliss of the act washed over her. It was just a tender affection shared between the two of them, a chance to be closer, one without the pressure of being physical.
    </p>
<p>
     She took her time when it came to washing off Agatha's skin. Her movements were deliberate, her fingers pressing and gently prodding at spots she sensed were stiff, which often elicited a heavy sigh or soft whimper out of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was turned on, yes. That much was fact. But there was something blooming over that, something more soft, more... special. It was perhaps the intimacy that hung over them, the simple act of learning what was there, in the present. In that moment, it was about exploration without assumption.
    </p>
<p>
     As she finished her task, Agatha turned back around to face her, that firm grip taking hold of the corner of her jaw. Her eyes seemed to trace over every curve of Rio's face, along her eyebrows, down her nose, over her top lip and then her bottom. It lifted, finally, meeting her gaze. She held it for a long moment, burning right into Rio's essence, before she finally sealed the space between them with a passionate kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     It stayed relatively tame, considering where they stood, and how absolutely naked they were, but Rio understood it as a silent show of gratitude, a soft thank you for being so willing and open.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached behind her, shutting the water off before she pulled open the door and grabbed the towels that she had hung on the rail in all of her foresight. She handed one over to Rio and stepped out to dry herself off, Rio falling in step a moment later. Once sufficiently dry, she followed Agatha back out into the room, her eyes casting over to her bag.
    </p>
<p>
     As if Agatha could hear the way her gaze sliced across the room, she stepped up behind Rio, the feel of a feather-light fingertip running it's way down her spine.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "We don't have to get dressed, if you don't want to,"
     </i>
     Agatha whispered from right behind her ear, causing a rippling of goosebumps to course over every inch of her skin. Like a sixth sense, though, Agatha seemed to notice the nerves.
     <i>
      "It's entirely your choice. I just want you to be comfortable,"
     </i>
     she added, pressing a firm kiss to the side of Rio's head.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn't have to say it.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't have to force out those three little words for Rio to just...
     <i>
      know
     </i>
     it.
    </p>
<p>
     She loved Rio, and she had been telling her that for days in the loudest actions she had been able to manage. Perhaps Rio had seen it all along, knew it was there, but she hadn't been willing to let herself slip so far into the fantasy that she ruined it without meaning to.  In that moment, Rio knew that what they were staring at in the face of the moment? It was an inevitability, if they were going to continue this, so what was the point in pushing it off? What was the point in trying to maintain some sense of control, if losing it meant feeling like this?
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio turned her head into the feel of Agatha behind her, her voice low and rich.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "C'mon,"
     </i>
     she offered softly, reaching behind her for Agatha's hand as she pulled her toward the bed, sliding onto it so that she could prop herself a little against the headboard; it was a stalling tactic. She was still trying her best to build her nerve, but she needed a little more time. Agatha read it like a book and slid next to her, the skin of their hips and arms touching with their closeness. Her hand landed, a gentle grip, on the top of Rio's thigh.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm sorry,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed in a rush.
     <i>
      "I'm just... nervous."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced over at her, that compassionate look on her face just so... understanding. Her lips twisted in thought for a moment, but then she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "This is why I didn't ask you to come home with me yet. Because here, we're on your court. Every pass, every play, it's your call and on your terms. I understand the responsibility you are tasking me with, even unknowingly."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     A flicker of confusion tinted Rio's eyes as they scoured Agatha's face for an explanation.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You told me that I'm the first person you've been with... in a very long time. I... cannot imagine the loneliness you have felt for over half of your life, but I understand it. I recognize that it was a necessity built on trauma. Someone hurt you, abused you, and changed your entire life without your permission. And so..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha paused, but Rio could tell it was because the emotion was starting to win out. Composed, rational Agatha was feeling what she was saying deep within her own bones.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So long as you and I are together, nothing will ever be done without your consent. It's not that you have to be the one to engage, or start, but I just want you to know that you always have a choice, a voice."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio felt so choked with emotion, gazing longingly into those eyes, so blanketed by the utter respect and veneration Agatha was clearly pouring directly into her soul. This woman was a puzzle, but with each piece, Rio was getting the bigger picture. She saw a compassionate woman who cared; she might have had to bristle at points in her life, due to a failing marriage, or the duties of what she did for work, but in that moment, Rio really
     <i>
      saw
     </i>
     Agatha for what she was.
    </p>
<p>
     She saw that though it had all been a bit in jest, Agatha was her own spiritual salvation, and Rio realized that she was becoming hers, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's palm raised, landing flush against Agatha's cheek, cupping it with a careful affection as she bathed in that gaze just a moment longer. It was so reverent, so gentle. Gone were the probing glances, gone were the stares that made her invisible. In the way that she saw Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was seeing her, too.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward, kissing her gently, a soft meeting of their lips as the gentle brush send sparks up the back of Rio's neck. It was so undemanding, and yet, it was a push on the door to her comfortability, to her security. She was officially letting Agatha in, no matter how fucking terrified the thought made her.
    </p>
<p>
     They kissed like that for a long few moments, just a tender exchange of emotion, a back and forth of just how they felt about one another. So carefully, Agatha separated their lips, those light-filled eyes flickering open in quiet question.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come here,"
     </i>
     she posed, though the tone of her voice, signified that it was more of a question than a demand as she tapped at the top of her thigh.
     <i>
      "I'd like to see you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The richness of her beguiling flared that heat in Rio's middle again. She understood what was being asked of her, and it only took her a brief second before she began to shift, answering the request. She moved up onto her knees, turning so that she was able to lift one off the bed, swinging it over to the other side of Agatha's legs so that she was effectively straddling her, that dull creep of embarrassed heat sneaking up her the skin of her abdomen.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand immediately landed on her hips, a safe place to begin, she figured. Her head tilted up, warm blues meeting Rio's emerald ones.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried so hard to name it, to name what sat there in Agatha's eyes, in her face. It was that familiar reverence, sure, but there was something more. She didn't know if she should quite call it hunger. Maybe... maybe it was a thirst. She was parched, aching to be hydrated, to be rejuvenated, and she was going to drink up every last drop she could get when it came to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     They sat like that for a long few moments, just watching, studying, learning, absorbing, memorizing. She finally felt movement as Agatha's hand lifted from her hip and raised, a silent question on her face as she held it out, requesting permission to touch.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded in response, but somehow, what she had been expecting is not what she received.
    </p>
<p>
     She closed her eyes, holding her breath, half expecting Agatha's hand to palm her breast, but instead, she felt the warm sliding of her fingertips around her neck, her palm landing curved around the shape of her throat. It wasn't a grab, it wasn't aggressive, it was just a gentle hold. It hesitated, but not for long. It began to glide over the surface of her warm skin, fingertips tracing heavy lines along the hollow of her throat, dipping down into the divot between her collarbones.
    </p>
<p>
     It traveled, a barely there brush along the length of one collarbone, back to the middle, and then across the other. Fingertips danced up the roll of her shoulders, down the curve of her biceps. Not once during the experience did Rio find the ability to open her eyes, to see what Agatha was getting out of this. It felt too good -- too pure. It was pulling her under, and she didn't need to see to feel every last bit of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Her palm pressed flat to Rio's skin, sliding, gracing over that skin like it was as precious as gold. She ran them over her breasts, her sides, her back, every single inch of her that she could reach.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's fingertip landed in that divot again, but then changed direction. It was one single touch, skating the lightest path directly down the center of Rio's torso. It was slow, as if Agatha were watching the flames it sparked it its wake, determining if they were going to hurt more than they were going to warm. It continued, right through the middle of her abdomen, stopping directly above her navel.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, her eyes somehow opened to the dim light of the room, and to Agatha looking at her like she was every single light in the sky, all at one time.
    </p>
<p>
     Her mouth opened, like she was going to say something, but by the soft sucking sound her tongue made when she did so, her mouth was bone dry, and it tickled something inside of Rio, although the immediate heat of her unasked question hung between them, sizzling.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio gave the softest, almost imperceptible nod of her head. She knew what Agatha wanted, and she wanted it too.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's touch above her bellybutton began to move, measured in its pace as it sank lower and lower until --
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sucked in a sharp breath, but it was immediately exhaled in a low moan the moment Agatha's touch graced her sensitive skin, her body nearly folding.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Gods, what it was like to be touched.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Her hand hand flown to Agatha's shoulder to steady herself. It was stupid, it was just a touch, not even a motion, and yet, she felt like she could just about combust.
    </p>
<p>
     She was in a sudden battle with herself between needing to keep her eyes closed to ground herself and also wanting to read every single expression on Agatha's face. She forced her eyes open, and there she was, just watching her, their eyes locking together as a small friction began to occur, a pleasurable caress of the most inward parts of her. Her breathing steadily grew ragged, especially the longer the movement wore on.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a hunger there, now, a desire that was burning so bright in Agatha's face that it was undeniable. It was like she literally had the entire world in the palm of her hand, as far as she was concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a movement, just the right brush, and the physical reaction was immediate; Rio's hips rocked down into Agatha's touch, her own grip tightening on Agatha's shoulder as a breathy sigh escaped her. She heard it, the low sound of a hum that rang with approval as it hit her ears. Opening her eyes again, Agatha's gaze this time was on her task, focused on what she was doing.
    </p>
<p>
     Completely unsteadily, Rio raised the hand that wasn't on Agatha's shoulder. Her fingers found the point of Agatha's chin, lifting her head up. As they came face to face, only a breath between them, Rio could feel that pressure building low in her belly, threatening to spill over. She willed it out of her mind, wanting to last a little longer. Instead, she busied herself by crushing their lips together in a sweltering kiss that elevated the temperature of the entire room in an instant.
    </p>
<p>
     They kissed, hot and hard, Agatha swallowing every single moan that Rio poured into her. Her touch was unrelenting, persistent, and she could feel the tension mounting in Rio's body.
    </p>
<p>
     In a flash of lightning that coursed the entire length of Rio's spine, her entire body contracted tightly for just a brief moment, releasing not a second later in an act that caused her to jerk her face away from Agatha's, a pleasured cry sounding loudly enough that it echoed off of the walls of that hotel room. She rocked forward, nearly collapsing into Agatha as her thighs trembled and the waves of that intense orgasm continued to rip through her like an angry, but incredibly satisfied, tide on a stormy night. Her face pressed into the bare skin of Agatha's neck, her breathing labored and ragged.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Holy shit,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed, turning to nuzzle into Rio's hair as she exhaled a delighted and self-satisfied laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, though, was too disoriented to form even an expletive to indicated just what she was feeling in that moment. She simply laid there, crumbled against Agatha, her breath hot on the other woman's neck as it finally began to slow, returning to an almost-normal pace. Slowly, she lifted herself back to her sitting position, though her hand was still on Agatha's shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     It began to move, sliding up to cup her cheek so that Rio could brush a thumb adoringly under her eye. There were so many things written in Rio's expression, dancing in the light of her eyes, but for the life of her, she couldn't find words. It was just that soft reverence, a way to bask in the moment that was bonding them together even further.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Who the hell are you?"
     </i>
     Rio finally managed, her whisper husky despite her genuine quest to attain that answer.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to let this land a little deeper, the answer forming in the depts of those cerulean irises.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Someone who is completely enamored by everything that you are," she admitted in the quietest of whispers.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She didn't say it, but Rio still heard it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Someone who, for some insane reason, has completely fallen in love with you over the course of three days.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Her lips twitched in a smile, though it was in response to both of Agatha's answers, spoken and unspoken.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Same, Agatha.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In that moment, their eyes met again and there was this sobering moment where Rio actually considered the possibility that Agatha could truly read her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment was thick, heavy with the weight of their unspoken feelings nestling between them. It felt almost tangible, the way Rio simply couldn't put any of what was going on inside of her into words. She had to find a way. She needed to make Agatha understand what she was doing to her, how she was opening her up and nurturing every piece of her without even actually trying.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's words were soft, but they lost their timid edge by the time she finished speaking.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I want to touch you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes widened slightly in her surprise, though a softness still shone in them, mixed so completely with the desire that was washing over her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Touch me."
     </i>

<p>
     Permission.
    </p>
<p>
     As it turned out, all Rio had simply needed was to be given the permission to find a way to funnel what it was she was feeling into some form of expression. All she had needed was for Agatha to look into her eyes, to stare right into her exposed soul, and tell her that it was okay.
    </p>
<p>
     She took it for everything it was worth in that moment, but it was perhaps not in the way that Agatha had anticipated with just how much weight there had been hanging over them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was precise in her movements, raising a single finger to place it in the space between Agatha's eyebrows, tracing it lightly down the length of her nose. Her eyes stayed locked on Rio's though, and she felt a ripple of nerves was through her. She didn't let it touch her face, but it was the reason for her next request, even if she could have passed it off by insisting she thought Agatha should get the same experience she'd had.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Close your eyes,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed, her tone silky and smooth, but also sultry in its own gentle way.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stilled, her eyes locking into Rio's, a flash there that Rio could not immediately name, but then it settled into her very being.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was always in control. She had a firm hold on life and directed it more firmly than she directed her own films. She did what she could to make life bend to her will, and she was good at it. It was why she had the power, the station that she did.
    </p>
<p>
     What completely struck Rio in that moment was that from the literal second their eyes met, Agatha perched on that bridge and Rio hanging over the rail of her deck to try and get her attention, Agatha had been losing control.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was an uncontainable entity, and Agatha really had said it best: Rio, in her purest form, was controlled chaos, and that was why Agatha was so drawn to her.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, it was Rio who took the chance to assure Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's okay. I promise."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That unfamiliar vulnerability was still soft in Agatha's gaze, but after another breath, she let them flutter shut, leaving Rio celebrating the gravity of the concession. In the way that Rio had trusted Agatha, Agatha was returning the favor.
    </p>
<p>
     Gingerly, a few of her fingertips raised, gracing light lines along Agatha's hairline, still damp from their shower. She started on one side and ventured to the other, caressing light lines along the frame of her face. She trekked over her temple, over the little hump of the outside of her cheekbone, down to her jaw. She traversed the angle of it, tracing the tips of those fingers along the length of it, to her chin, and doubled back on the other side. It curved up, back up the other side of her face, a couple of fingers deliberately brushing over her ear as her hand made its way back up.
    </p>
<p>
     Both hands then raised, landing on the sides of her face, leaving space for her thumbs to hover over her cheeks in their movement, a not-quite-there touch that, by the look on Agatha's face, she still felt. She drew her hands back, dragging the tips of her fingers along both sides of Agatha's neck until they met at the center of her throat. One hand dropped, but the other touched the very tip of her chin, a light press that silently commanded action.
    </p>
<p>
     Wordlessly, Agatha heeded Rio's request and tipped her head back the slightest bit, the edge of her lip pulling between her teeth in heated anticipation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn't help the small smirk that curved her lips; it felt good to be in that woman's lap, and yet, Agatha was the one who was putty in her hands. For as much as she had insisted that there was little she would say no to when it came to Agatha, she was starting to realize that it was more of a mutual understanding than something that only went one way.
    </p>
<p>
     That touch, that feather of contact drifted down, right down the center of Agatha's throat, causing it to quiver the slightest bit as it tightened within her. As she reached the base of her neck, though, she lifted her finger and instead moved to touch the spot just beneath Agatha's ear, causing her to draw in a sharp breath; she'd obviously hit a spot. She let her touch glide down, over the crook of her neck and over the top of her shoulder. It ventured down, sliding over the length of her bicep to her elbow, then down to her hand, which she pulled into both of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked down at it, but glanced back up at Agatha to make sure her eyes were still closed. Her fingertips graced along the bones of her hand, careful to pay attention to each one equally, following those lines to the tips of Agatha's fingers, one by one. When she had finished that, she turned it over in her grasp and rubbed it gently, softly, working any tension there out. After a moment, she lowered Agatha's hand and intentionally placed it on her thigh, giving her a gentle squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     With focused intent, she repeated the process on the other side, the touches over her shoulder, her arm, her hand. She massaged that palm, too, those palms she loved so much to hold. She gently set it down again, putting it where she wanted on her opposite thigh. As her gaze swept up, though, she found herself a little shocked to be looking Agatha in the eye.
    </p>
<p>
     A deep blush crept up her neck, but she didn't waver, didn't back down. She met her smoldering gaze evenly, as if to push, to encourage her to explain why she had chosen to open them.
    </p>
<p>
     What fell from her lips struck something in Rio, causing her eyes to glass over.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What are you doing to me?"
     </i>
     Agatha whimpered in a sound that was almost helpless, and the confusion on her face was almost palpable.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio considered for just a moment, but spoke before she could stop herself.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm taking one of my many lessons in learning how to love you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stilled completely, not even a shift of her chest with any breath. She was looking at Rio like she was fucking terrified, like she was so impossibly scared that Rio had just put a name to something they had been trying so hard to keep taboo.
    </p>
<p>
     Visibly, Rio shrank.
    </p>
<p>
     In an instant, Agatha was sitting up, both of her hands raising to take a firm hold on Rio's face, pulling her close, those deep pools of blue looking straight into her. A breath passed between them, and the space was gone.
    </p>
<p>
     The way Agatha kissed Rio right in that moment? It was crushing, it was consuming. It was almost aggressive, but in a way that was fueled by a deep emotional welling that knew no other cure. Their lips smacked, their teeth clicked, and they were locked in a trade off of who could devour the most number of moans. Tongues were wild, brushing, pushing, damn near wrestling. Agatha's hands had stayed put on Rio's face, holding her there firmly, but Rio had not been able to wrangle in a similar form of self-control.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands wandered, first over Agatha's chest, over both of her breasts at the same time that drew out an incredibly loud moan, one that rattled Rio's teeth.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      There it was!
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     A thrill twisted through her, a skipping of her heartbeat that had to be noticeable through their kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Agatha's thunder.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Her fingers flexed as an automatic response, gripping as she was stuck, trying to keep herself tethered to the moment, instead of completely floating away from the utter bliss that swarmed her. She loosened her grip, somehow able to command her movement despite the fact that they kiss they were sharing was shooting fire at every single neuron in her brain. Her hold lifted, but her fingertips moved, brushing so softly over Agatha's erect nipples, dropping lower to rake down her abdomen.
    </p>
<p>
     As she reached just above Agatha's hips, she felt her pull away suddenly. Her eyes opened into Agatha's in confusion, as if she had done something wrong, but the pure emotion she was met with?
    </p>
<p>
     There were tears sitting in Agatha's eyes, fighting to not fall, and it softened Rio exponentially. She wanted to determine the cause, to just mend it and make it alright again. But then came Agatha's voice, a whisper that was so tightened by emotion that it struck Rio, straight in her heart.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you, Rio. I know it's insane, it's--"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In an instant, Rio's hand raised and she pressed a solitary finger to Agatha's lips, a silent request for her to stop talking, and a silent assurance that she didn't need to explain herself. It lowered the next moment, Rio's gaze soft, holding Agatha in its warmth.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward, pressing a kiss that was almost too soft for their current position to Agatha's lips, pulling back to press their foreheads together. Her own voice was a low, honest whisper.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you too, Agatha. And I have since the moment I pulled you out of that marina."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She kissed her again, though it was brief, more of a punctuation than anything else.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It doesn't have to make sense, because it doesn't make sense at all. All I know..."
     </i>
     she breathed at her, pulling back just enough so that she could look at her, really look at her.
     <i>
      "All I know is that I am ready to do what I need to if it means I get to keep you, like this, in my life."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked, and two lone tears dropped, one on each cheek. She wasn't upset anymore, and the fear was gone from her eyes. Those tears, they were pure emotion. They were a raw showing that for as much as Agatha had been grasping Rio's heart from the inside, Rio had been doing the same thing back the entire time, without even realizing it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted a hand, palming one of her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I've got you. And I promise, I will never intentionally hurt you. You've given me every single reason to trust you, to believe that you have my best interests at heart."
     </i>
     Rio's lip quivered for a moment, the tears threatening to spill from her own eyes as she pressed forward.
     <i>
      "Trust me, Agatha. Trust me to do for you what it is you strive to do for me every moment we're together. Trust me to love you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That emotion was clearly overflowing in Agatha's entire expression, as if it were the first time in her entire life that she had heard someone say something even remotely similar to her. They were frozen in time for that moment, basking in the new weightlessness that had come the moment they had let go of all they had been holding back.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You... you're..."
     </i>
     Agatha managed, her tone still soft, her eyes darting from side to side across Rio's face as she searched as if she could somehow find the words there.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned toward her again, folding their lips together in a toned down, emotional kiss that lingered for just a moment.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What I am, Agatha, is yours."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was pulling on her again, this time a frenzied flurry of moving grip, anything to try and get Rio as close as she could possibly manage, like she wanted to melt right into her. Their lips met again, but there was more urgency there, this time, like Agatha was desperate for the taste, like she couldn't get enough.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hands were at it in an instant, but this time there was more of a strength in her grip, in the way she would grip and squeeze, feeling the give of Agatha's muscles beneath her fingertips. They kissed like that, loud and heavy, for what could have been an eternity, but Rio had taken every bit of that time to gather her own courage.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled away, eliciting a soft whine of disappointment from the other woman, but she was fluid in her movements as she pulled herself from Agatha's lap and shifted off to her side. Her hesitation had evaporated and she pressed her face into Agatha's neck, her lips grazing the skin there. She was gentle in her ravishing, only the softest nips, the gentlest sucking at her skin, but she could tell that it was accomplishing what she set out to do.
    </p>
<p>
     She shifted again, this time moving so that her own body was angled a little more toward Agatha's, a light touch landing near the middle of her stomach. It was an idle palm, nothing immediately pressing, but she could feel the swell as Agatha pulled in a slow breath right at the same moment Rio's lips touched
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     spot on her neck.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Touch me,"
     </i>
     she said again, but this time, it was a soft whimper, a gentle beg for release.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's palm shifted, sliding over to Agatha's hip, down the side of her thigh, and then back up the top of it, though she hesitated when she felt something she didn't understand. Her eyes swept down and she saw it, the small area of wetness atop Agatha's thighs that had surely come from between her own legs. She couldn't help the breathy giggle that escaped her just before she pressed her face back into the crook of Agatha's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     Each one of her movements were calculated; she dove for that spot on her neck at the exact moment that her fingers met Agatha's dripping warmth. A soft cry sounded from Agatha's throat, surely from the shock of both things at once, and it reignited that white hot ball of fire in Rio's stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips somehow maintained their work on Agatha's neck and jaw, but if only by some autopilot response. Rio's entire mind was on her hand and its location. Her fingers were gentle in their exploration, feeling out every dip and fold of the most intimate part of Agatha. The reaction it was pulling from her was tantalizing, but something about Rio's mind was hung up on memorizing it, of learning this lesson the right way.
    </p>
<p>
     Two fingers started toward the bottom, dragging slowly up the slickness they found there until they brushed up, a gentle grazing of that small bundle of nerves, which caused Agatha to immediately stiffen, an uncontrollable moan filling their air around them.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Gods,
     </i>
     Rio thought,
     <i>
      I will never, ever get enough of that.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She pressed firmly, but not too toughly, and began to work into a gentle rhythm. She was so positively in tune with every single move Agatha was making, every hitching of her breath, every low whine that came from the base of her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     The way Agatha's hand had found it's way to her occupied arm was not lost on her, especially with the increasing strength of the grip located there. She didn't mind it, mostly because she was too focused on what she was doing to pay it any attention.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips finally parted from the home they had been occupying on her neck and lifted to her jaw, kissing down to her chin, all while keeping that movement and pressure measuredly consistent. She tilted her head up and swept Agatha's lips into a warm kiss, some deep part of her needing the thunder she knew was on the verge of rolling in.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, with the slightest flick of her tongue against Agatha's, it arrived in every bit of its glory, both the thunder and Agatha's rippling orgasm. The way she could feel that sound in every inch of her soul as it filled her mouth, filled her throat, filled her lungs, it was entirely disorienting. What was even more disorienting was the way Agatha's body seemed to completely seize, her knees slamming together, effectively trapping Rio's hand where it was. Her nails were embedded in Rio's arm and it was almost like, for a solid ten seconds, she forgot how to breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     In a sudden gasp, Agatha came back into herself, though she was still panting wildly, her eyes shut in a mix of bliss and surrender. In fact, Rio was acutely that every bit of her was still trembling as those waves seemed to continue to tear through her. Without hesitation, Rio shifted, moving to place herself against the headboard. In the same second, she reached over and pulled Agatha into her arms, holding her firmly to her chest.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I've got you,"
     </i>
     she breathed at her, tucking her chin to place her lips to the top of Agatha's head, but she left them there.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I... Fuck, Rio. I love you so much."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio breathed the lightest, softest chuckle, kissing her head again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you just as much. You can believe in that."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's own breath was warm across the skin of her chest as she, too, exhaled the gentlest giggle.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yeah? And what is it that you believe in?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio reached for Agatha's chin, tilting it up toward her so that she could meet that gaze again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I believe in you, Agatha."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     There was no recollection as to which one of them had been the one to do it, but the curtains had thankfully been pulled the night before, so that when Rio awoke in a tangle of warm flesh and soft hair, she was not immediately disgruntled by the onslaught of light pouring in from it. Instead, she just laid there, eyes closed, and let the weight of the night before settle over her.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel it, what had been accomplished, in every single place that their skin touched. Their legs were tangled and Rio could feel every single place the front of Agatha's body pressed to her back, the body heat something to revel in.
    </p>
<p>
     She laid like that for a decent while, just taking it in, just realizing that this was her life. This could be the rest of her life, if there was a feasible path toward it. She could wake up every single morning in the arms of the woman she loved, if she wanted it badly enough. It was a topic that would take a lot more thought and planning than she was willing to give it in those moments, so she pushed it to the back of her mind for the time being.
    </p>
<p>
     Carefully, she reached for her phone to check the time, unable to stifle the softest laugh that spilled from her lips. It was 3:30 on a Tuesday afternoon. What time had they even fallen asleep? The sun hadn't been coming up, she didn't think, but she could have been wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     Another few moments passed and Rio could feel the tugging in her chest, the need to call Estee. Of course she wasn't going to completely kiss and tell, but she owed it to Estee to at least provide some information about what had been unfolding there.
    </p>
<p>
     She was careful and slow as she managed to slide out from Agatha's arm, though she stilled as Agatha stirred the slightest bit, but then sunk back into her pillow, the sleep still keeping its grip on her.
    </p>
<p>
     She had started over to her bag, but then something caught her eye a few feet from it -- Agatha's bag. With a warm smile to herself, she paced over to it and gently thumbed through it, pulling out a soft violet t-shirt. She pulled it over her head and pulled on a pair of her own underwear before she scooped up her phone and quietly made her way out onto the balcony.
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed the call button, but at the sight of herself in the camera, her eyes widened slightly and she raised her free hand to smooth out the wild tangle of her hair. It had lowered just as Estee answered, that bright and beautiful smile filling Rio with a new but familiar warmth, one that only Estee could provide.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama! I miss you!" she chimed brightly, and the grin Rio had already been wearing only seemed to spread wider.
    </p>
<p>
     "I miss you too, roo. How are things over there?" she posed, tilting her head curiously.
    </p>
<p>
     "They're good. No second date, so no need for elaboration on that tidbit from the other night. I've mostly just been cramming for finals. It's so crazy that I get to come home for good in almost a month."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded in agreement, but before she could respond, Estee cut her off.
    </p>
<p>
     "But school is boring and not at all what should be the substance of this conversation. How are things going?"
    </p>
<p>
     Although she had tried to temper her immediate reaction, Rio's smile grew a bit sheepish, and Estee picked up on it immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama!" she practically squealed.
    </p>
<p>
     "Shh!" Rio hushed, leaning forward in her chair, as if to pull the source of the sound further from the door. "She's still sleeping."
    </p>
<p>
     "I... am amazed. I thought you were going to be a celibate spinster until you died."
    </p>
<p>
     "Ouch, mija."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's eyes sparkled with her laughter before it sounded.
    </p>
<p>
     "But really... good for you, mama. You have waited a very long time to be with someone, and I'm just... so fucking happy that you finally got your person."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes softened, that recollection of their exchange the night before playing through her mind as an involuntary memory.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama?" Estee posed, and Rio re-focused, eyes snapping back to the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips twisted as she watched her daughter for a moment. She was trying to find the right words, the right phrasing for what she wanted to ask. And then, it hit her. Agatha had asked it exactly the right way.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mija, do you... do you believe that people can be soulmates?"
    </p>
<p>
     The fascination was immediately clear on her daughter's face, as if she were trying to gauge whether or not Rio, of all people, had actually just asked her that question. She wanted to be admonishing, Rio could tell, but she took a moment to actually think about the question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama, I think what you need to hear is that if it feels right to you, then it is right. It doesn't matter what anybody else thinks."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was quiet for a moment, her throat bobbing slightly with her nerves as she tried to find her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "She told me she loved me," Rio divulged, and Estee's reaction? She completely lit up, as if someone had flipped a switch inside of her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mama! Oh my god!"
     </i>
     she gushed, clearly losing her mind.
     <i>
      "And?!"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "And I told her that I loved her, too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Estee's squeals filled Rio with absolute joy, so much that it was about to spill over. She had never known in her life what it could feel like to be so impossibly fucking happy.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean... after she took me on a beachside horseback ride to a secluded cove, how could I not, right?" she posed, and this drew an even more exaggerated reaction out of Estee.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama, what the actual fuck?! How the hell did your life become a literal romance novel?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Absolutely no clue, mija. But... I'm going to live in it a little while longer."
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you know when you're going to come home?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips pressed together and she exhaled a soft sigh. She had been trying not to spend a lick of her energy dwelling on that minute detail.
    </p>
<p>
     "Probably in a week or two. I definitely want to be home to get you from the airport."
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama, that's in a month."
    </p>
<p>
     "I know, sweet girl, but I have work. I only took a week off, and even though I brought my laptop, I might only be able to land another week tops. Plus, I really hate being so far away from you."
    </p>
<p>
     Something washed over Estee's face, and in the moment Rio picked it up, it disappeared. She wanted to ask, but some part of her could already see it. How was she going to make this work with Agatha if she was already homesick? That was yet another question she would answer at a later date, if only for herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, see if you can bring her back with you," Estee teased softly, her smile warm.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe if she were not a woman of power in the industry who probably has a lot more important things to do than take an impromptu vacation across the world because I'm needy."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Estee gave every bit of effort she had into rolling her eyes as far back into her head as they would go, causing Rio to dissolve into laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     "Consider it, mama. I'd love to actually meet her."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's smile softened. "I think she'd love to meet you, too, mija."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee straightened up a little, tilting her head at her mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright, I'm all caught up to speed. Get back in there with your
     <i>
      girlfriend,
     </i>
     " she offered, her tone thick on that last word. This time, it was Rio's eyes that rolled.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, mija. Have a good rest of your day, okay?"
    </p>
<p>
     That warm smile and those beautiful eyes staring back at her, they made Rio so impossibly thankful to have that child as hers.
    </p>
<p>
     "Te amo, mama."
    </p>
<p>
     "Te veo, mija."
    </p>
<p>
     She lowered the phone and leaned back into her chair, the warm afternoon sun touching every bit of her face, bathing it in its glow. For the first time in her entire life, a brand new Rio was looking out on the world.
    </p>
<p>
     She was a Rio that was in love, and a Rio that was so very loved.
    </p>
<p>
     After another moment, she lifted herself up from the chair and turned to head back in the sliding door, pulling it shut softly behind her. The room was still quiet, and so when she lifted her head to look over at the bed, she had not been expecting Agatha to be awake.
    </p>
<p>
     There, wrapped up in the olive colored sheets, draped over her hip as a bare leg curled out and forward, laid Agatha looking like she had been pulled from a late 18th century painting. Her own eyes swept to take in Rio, and an instant grin seemed to blossom on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "You went through my bag?" she posed, though her tone was still laden with sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shrugged innocently, making her way over to the bed. "Tit for tat, I figured," she offered, her eyes bright as she slid onto the bed, laying on her side in front of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are something else," she breathed in a soft laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe," she offered back, a gentle smile gracing her lips. "Or maybe, I'm just everything you want."
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh Rio," Agatha gushed, leaning forward to steal a quick kiss. "There's not a single question in my mind about that."

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     The two of them laid in soft reverence for a few moments before the audible grumbling of Agatha's stomach echoed and caused the both of them to dissolve into giggles. They had decided on ordering room service, which had mostly consisted of fruit and cheese and crackers, and they had lounged around for a little longer, idling between flipping through their phones or watching television.
    </p>
<p>
     For as non-stop go as they had been those first three days, it felt nice to just sleep in, lounge around, and spend the majority of her day curled against Agatha's side, her arm draped over her in a warm but protective hold, as if she couldn't stand the thought of her getting even an inch away.
    </p>
<p>
     It was bordering on seven in the evening, and as the gentle sounds of the television landed around them, Rio was suddenly struck with a thought -- or more of a feeling -- and sat up at the weight of it. She was quiet as she processed, her teeth digging gently into the inside of her lower lip. She had been that quiet just a beat too long, and Agatha spoke, raising a hand to rest on her back.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio?" she posed, her tone so soft and innocent, so curious.
    </p>
<p>
     There was another beat of silence, of processing, and then Rio's voice, thick with its sudden sense of urgency.
    </p>
<p>
     "I should check out."
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel it, the way Agatha stilled behind her; the thumb that had been brushing at her back stopped its motion immediately. She could hear that sharp breath, and the uncertainty in what that implied. She didn't want it to root anywhere within her, so she turned her head enough that she could take Agatha in, her eyes soft with affection.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think I'm tired of running up your tab."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha's smile was wide and instant, something she could hardly think to temper. She understood, the dawning of realization washing over her, bathing her in that rich warmth. She tilted her head at Rio, an utter look of amazement dancing across her expression.
    </p>
<p>
     "I get to take you home?"
    </p>
<p>
     In an instant, Rio's chest squeezed, but she was quick to mask it with a gentle, warm smile as she gave a light nod of her head. What she was hiding? The way Agatha had decided to phrase that, it pointedly shot right through her. This wasn't her home, and likely never would be, but there was something so purely innocent about it that left Rio feeling as though she could have floated away.
    </p>
<p>
     "It is a little later... do you want to wait until tomorrow?" Agatha posed sweetly, her gaze sweeping over Rio's face, as if to gauge her response, which was almost instant.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think if the last month of my life has taught me anything, it's that I'm really tired of waiting for things I want," she returned. Her head had turned forward again, but she was surprised by the slipping of Agatha's palm around her throat, gently pulling her back, pinning her to the pillows. In a single blink, Agatha was hovering above her, her hair cascading over her shoulder, tickling Rio's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched with vested interest as she came closer, their lips a breath apart, but she stopped, a devilish light dancing in her eyes. She didn't miss it, that briefest contact, the slightest swipe of the tip of her tongue along the under side of Rio's top lip.
    </p>
<p>
     A low, gravelly whine sounded from her throat, Agatha's fingers tightening in automatic reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, so slowly, a wicked smirk twisted up Agatha's lips and she released her hold, pressing herself to sit back up.
    </p>
<p>
     From behind her, Rio was blinking at her wildly, a soft whimper falling from her lips in disappointment. What the fuck was that? Where was the follow-up?! That was it?
    </p>
<p>
     Then, as if Agatha was listening in once more, her chin tucked over her shoulder, a perfect display of her profile.
    </p>
<p>
     "Some things are worth waiting for, don't ya think?" she posed, and even from that view of her from the side, Rio could see that same smirk finding a home on its her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "You little devil," Rio shot back, though she was instantly sitting up, using every muscle in her core to lift her as quickly as possible, her hands landing immediately on Agatha's sides, squeezing gently. She pulled her back closer and buried her face in the crook of her neck from behind, breathing a sigh of laughter and contentment against her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     The hum she got in response was satisfactory enough.
    </p>
<p>
     "Come on, let's pack," Rio suggested, giving her sides a light squeeze again.
    </p>
<p>
     They had set about their work, packing their things and tidying up the room in accordance with being a decent human being. As they each pulled their respective bags over their shoulders, Rio couldn't help but turn as they stopped to open the door and take one last survey of the last four days of her life, and her first four days not only in a new country, but in a brand new emotion.
    </p>
<p>
     That hotel room would forever be the place Rio let herself fall all the way in love with Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a fondness in the smile that curled up the corners of her lips, but she turned, picking up Agatha's awaiting hand as they made their exit from the Freehand and turned the page to their next chapter, a chapter where this time, they were on Agatha's turf.
    </p>
<p>
     Though it should have terrified her? There was something strangely thrilling about it that had Rio aching in anticipation.
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     Something enticing was coursing through Rio's entire being as the two of them stood on that welcome mat, Agatha fidgeting with her keys as she found the right one and unlocked the door, swinging it open into the darkness of the home.
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately, Rio noted that it smelled differently than when they had been there those couple of days before. There was something in the air, something like the scent of... cologne?
    </p>
<p>
     Her brow had knit slightly at the same time Agatha flipped on the light, her eyes falling behind Rio to something in the living room. The expression on her face was a forced mask, the true emotions of concern and mild panic flashing through her eyes instead.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned, her eyes finding the dark navy garment on the white couch with ease. Her own confusion was immediate on her face as she turned back, the unasked question in her eyes. After only a beat, Agatha's expression softened as she marched with exaggerated steps over to the base of the stairs, leaning casually on the banister.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicholas Scratch! If you're up there in that bedroom instead of waiting to surprise your mother whenever she decided to turn up, you've missed your shot!"
    </p>
<p>
     There was nothing for just a moment, then a faint
     <i>
      "Shit!"
     </i>
     from overhead as scrambled footsteps ripped down the hallway.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes lifted from where she stood to the bright-eyed young man that stood at the top of the steps, an utter look of adoration on his face as he bound down the steps and swept his mother into a massive hug, holding her tight.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound that came from Agatha? That pure, raw, unfiltered laughter of sheer joy and happiness? It melted Rio right in her middle, that familiar warmth she felt when she was with Agatha beginning to spread through her again.
    </p>
<p>
     His chin had been over Agatha's shoulder, his eyes squeezed shut as he reveled in the moment. As they opened, though? A pair of impossibly bright green eyes were staring straight into her own, confusion clearly washing over him. He placed his hands on the upper part of Agatha's biceps, pulling back so he could look down at her. He looked... guilty?
    </p>
<p>
     "I didn't know you were going to have company. I should have texted," he told her softly and Rio diverted her gaze, suddenly feeling like she was toeing the edge of being intrusive.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky," Agatha admonished softly, reaching up to lovingly cradle his cheek. "It's okay. I'm glad you're home. And before you get annoyingly persistent about going somewhere else, I will lovingly remind you that you know where the keys to the pool house are, and also remind that the refrigerator in there still has that twelve pack of beer from your birthday."
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom, are you sure?" he questioned back, the clear weight of what they knew that Rio did not sitting in his gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     She gave a gentle nod, letting go of his cheek to swivel, placing her hand in the center of his back as she ushered him forward, causing Rio to lift her head. "In fact, there's someone I'd like you to meet." She held her hand out to Rio who hesitated a moment, glancing up into her eyes as if to double check that it was okay. She was only met with warm reassurance in those beautiful blue eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     She reached down, sliding her hand into Agatha's as she stepped forward, a genuinely warm smile coming to her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky, this is Rio. She's..." Agatha's gaze swept back down to her, regarding her with a gentle affection for a moment while she found the right words. Her eyes lifted to her son again, the smile of sheer joy finding her lips easily. "She is my partner."
    </p>
<p>
     He did an amazing job -- almost -- at hiding the way he wanted to balk. It was the slightest widening of his eyes and the smallest loosening of his jaw that completely gave him away. This was clearly something he was not accustomed to from his mother, and Rio's interest was suddenly piqued.
    </p>
<p>
     Something a little... uncomfortable? It shifted in her middle, but she did her best to temper it, to not let it grace even a muscle of her features. It was just the context of the entire welcoming that had gnawed at her interest. His words, his ask for assurance, the way he seemed to be not that surprised that she had company, but definitely shocked that she had announced that this woman in her home was her partner?
    </p>
<p>
     That word, it held gravity. In some strange way, Rio understood it. They weren't just girlfriends, that felt too cheap. Agatha always seemed to have quite the penchant for finding just the right words at just the right times.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, those facts stacking on one another in rapid succession left Rio with questions that she knew needed to be saved for another time, and she was also aware that they were questions she might not want answers to.
    </p>
<p>
     He recovered quickly, a warm smile finding his lips -- so much like Agatha's -- as he reached out, holding a hand out for her to shake. She obliged, though it felt a little awkward, maybe even forced.
    </p>
<p>
     "And Rio, this is Nicky, my son."
    </p>
<p>
     She offered a sweet smile in response, feeling that she was doing a great job at masking the sudden inner turmoil within herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Those few awkward moments were enough for Rio to become acutely aware that if Agatha had considered this, having the two of them meet, she had perhaps wanted to have a bit of a conversation with her son about it. Rio had sensed that they were not as close, perhaps, as herself and Estee were, but she had found nothing wrong with that. Agatha had explained it pretty well, she had thought.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe, she thought, that was where this was all coming from. He had been in the dark, and he felt like the one that was intruding, even in his own home.
    </p>
<p>
     Something reminiscent of an ache tugged at Rio's heart; she couldn't imagine having gone through the last month of her life without her daughter knowing. She knew that every relationship was different, that everything in a parent v child relationship was heavily dependent on the experiences of both parties during the child's entire life.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee had been her one and only, always. It was becoming clear to Rio in that moment, and based on past things Agatha had said, that Agatha and Nicky had used their careers to put space between them intentionally.
    </p>
<p>
     It made Rio a little sad. She wasn't sure why, but she had been expecting something... different when she had eventually been presented with this moment.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a very vivid waving of a flag that reminded Rio that there were still years of Agatha that she had yet to learn. She knew the reverse was true, but it felt more pressing now that she was learning another lesson in Agatha, one that she did not really want to be present for. It felt like she did not belong, like it was something she should not be there watching.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was suddenly doing something Rio had never seen her do before -- she was fidgeting, a restless motion of rubbing the fabric of her leggings between her fingers, as if she were nervous. Rio ached so badly to reach out, to grab her hand and soothe those nerves, but she recognized that they were nowhere near in a scenario where that would be acceptable.
    </p>
<p>
     "Would you like to have dinner with us? I can throw something together, if you'd like," Agatha offered sweetly, and Rio could hear that tinge, that squeeze of a plea. She could see it on Agatha's face, the moment she realized what he was going to do. Her lips tucked just slightly at the corners and the wrinkles of hope from lifted eyebrows smoothed out in realization.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was a long flight. I think I'll grab those keys and tuck in for the night. Maybe we can do something tomorrow?" he posed softly, a hopeful smile appearing on his face. The sincerity in his tone seemed to soothe Agatha the slightest bit and her posture gave in, slack for the time being.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, baby boy. As always, help yourself to anything in here. The back door will be unlocked if you need anything."
    </p>
<p>
     He gave her a long, firm hug and let her go to kiss her on the cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll see you in the morning, mom," he voiced gently, giving her arm a light squeeze as he turned to depart for the evening, Agatha watching after him.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood behind her, her teeth digging lightly into the full flesh of her lower lip as she held herself, her arms wrapped loosely across her own middle, as if she were trying to protect herself, even though something in her shouted that they were past that... weren't they? Slowly, Agatha turned to face her, and the guilt she saw there metled the bit of frost she had started to develop in her bristling.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stepped forward, her hands sliding smoothly onto Rio's side as she stepped a little closer, wrapping one arm around her waist. With such a fluid movement, it compelled Rio to release the hold on herself, her hands landing flat on Agatha's chest. Her eyes lifted, meeting those soft blues in silent curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I had no idea he was going to be here," she told her softly, but of that, Rio had already been aware. She had been able to tell the moment Agatha had laid eyes on that sweater, watch as the confusion had crossed her face. It had been genuine, not fabricated. "If I would have, you know I would have said something..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha, shh, it's okay. I believe you." Rio's tone was a gentle comfort, a soft reassurance that it really was okay. Sure, she had a genuine desire to understand a little more about that dynamic, and the interaction itself, but that could be a conversation for later.
    </p>
<p>
     That look in Agatha's eyes was unfamiliar to Rio and it was only lending to the fact that she could tell something about this had really shaken something up in Agatha. Rio, herself, was feeling a little lost in the dark; had the dynamic changed? What was she allowed to do? What should she not do? She was suddenly back into the mind frame of classic Rio, the anxiety bubbling up in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips twisted in a mild apprehension as her eyes darted over Agatha's face in thought, trying to find the courage she needed to get the words out.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can... go back to the hotel, if you think it would be better?" she offered, though it was obvious in her tone that it was really the last thing she wanted. She was trying to offer a remedy to a quick tension, and the last thing she wanted to do was cause any kind of friction between Agatha and her son.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shook her head dismissively.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course not. This is, after all, my house, and whether or not my son decides to show up on a whim does not dictate the company I get to keep in said home."
    </p>
<p>
     The content of what she said, and exactly how she said it, it was new. It was something Rio struggled for a moment to identify: It was Agatha fighting to keep a firm grasp on something she felt like she still had control over. It didn't make her point any less valid, but it was a subtle show of defiance, a way of asserting that in her domain, she was the one with the control.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha..." Rio breathed at her, beguiling her to look back down at her. When she obliged, Rio leaned toward her, brushing their lips softly together.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's okay. You don't have to do that when it's just us."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In a series of firsts, Rio saw Agatha's nostrils flare the slightest bit and a small crease formed in her brow. As she realized what she had done, even automatically, her face softened as she beheld the woman in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm sorry... I just..." Agatha exhaled a soft sigh, her lips moving to worry together in a thin line. Her expression softened the slightest bit, though, and she tilted her head slightly to the side.
     <i>
      "Why don't I throw something together for us to eat, and then we can go get comfortable?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There was something on the tip of Rio's tongue, an unasked question that she couldn't quite force out. She shoved it down, pushed it away for the time being. Time and place. Time and place.
    </p>
<p>
     She agreed with a gentle nod, leaning in to take the most gentle kiss before letting Agatha go so that she could do as she had said she would. Rio had perched on one of the stools at the kitchen island, watching her with a gentle interest as she started perparing what Rio had gathered was a bruschetta.
    </p>
<p>
     The tension in the air was new, and it was uncomfortable. Agatha was quiet as she worked, no conversation and no trace of a hum, just straight focus. It was unnerving Rio the longer it drew on, her eyes hardly wavering from Agatha's back as she busied herself with the task at hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha... are you okay?" Rio finally decided to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted her head, glancing over her shoulder just briefly, hardly long enough to be constituted as an actual look.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm fine," she dismissed, offering no further elaboration.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it, the stone in her chest as it began to sink, lower and lower into her stomach. She felt like she was suffering from whiplash, like the Agatha that she had walked into that house was suddenly gone and had been replaced with an Agatha that was willing to shut her out when things got uncomfortable. It made her sad, although she was trying not to let it.
    </p>
<p>
     The anxiety that stemmed in her chest came from the fact that, really? She didn't even know what was wrong, so she didn't know what she could possibly do to try and fix it.
    </p>
<p>
     After a few more minutes of Agatha moving between the counter and the stove, she had plated their food and turned to face Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "Would you like to go upstairs? I'd just really like to climb into bed with you, eat this, and snuggle up." Her voice was so resigned, so suddenly tired. The defeat in her was something Rio was bearing witness to for the first time and while she had been gripped with the anxiety that it had been because of her presence, she realized that it had been stupid to make such an assumption.
    </p>
<p>
     If they had walked into that house, and it would have been empty? This night surely would have taken a different direction, but Rio was suddenly understanding that the shift in Agatha's demeanor had everything to do with that short little interaction.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll grab the bags," Rio told her softly, leaning toward her to press a gentle kiss to the apple of her cheek, a pure show of affection and understanding more than it was of intimacy.
    </p>
<p>
     She paced over and picked up both bags, nodding toward Agatha, who had tucked a bottle of wine under her arm, to lead the way. She followed her through the home, and while her intent had been to observe and take in the details the further exploration of the house had to offer, she found herself too stuck on Agatha to really care about anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to fix what seemed to have broken in her, wanted to mend the tears in her that were opening her up in a way Rio had not quite been so ready to see. Even her posture was different as she carried herself up those stairs, so laden with the weight of what Nicky's presence had brought with it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha led her down the long hall, turning toward the left to gently nudge the door open with her foot. As she entered, she used her elbow to flip on the light. Rio stepped into the doorway behind her, eyes sweeping to take in the contents of the room. It was
     <i>
      huge
     </i>
     and it was immaculately decorated. Against the far wall, directly centered, was a king side bed with a post at every corner, a rich dark marbling of wood. There were two beautifully polished wooden nightstands and a dresser on the left wall that seemed to match. The vanity was extravagant in all of the best ways.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes shifted, though, to the right wall in the corner. Cut into the wall, there were shelves that ran from the floor to the ceiling, lined side to side with too many books to count. Something in Rio warmed; Agatha was a bookworm. There was something endearingly cute about the fact.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, this is it, hm?" Rio posed, her voice low and rich as her gaze cast to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha set both plates down, tabling the bottle of wine right next to them. She turned to face Rio, the question on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "This is the temple of Agatha Harkness," Rio stated, as if it were completely obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     That nervous, upset tension that had been pulling Agatha's muscles taught seemed to ease, if only the slightest bit. Her expression melted a little, and her posture slackened before she crossed the space between them, reaching up with one hand to cradle Rio's jaw in her palm.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "How do you do that?"
     </i>
     Agatha asked Rio, this time, her gaze a little frantic in its search for answers.
    </p>
<p>
     She almost played coy, almost asked what she meant, but she sensed that the moment called for a little more seriousness, a little more acknowledgement. She took a moment to find her voice, to say what she felt the impulse to say.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Because I see you. Sometimes, I even think I hear you in my head. But you... you are a book I've read a million times, and yet, somehow, new chapters keep appearing."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha, in that moment, looked like she wanted to cry. Rio understood that the words had power, her words had that power, but this was something she was struggling to figure out. She was being honest, and she was following through on every single promise that she had made thus far, so why did Agatha look so afraid?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tilted her head forward, their foreheads pressing together as she exhaled a soft sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had this sense, this feeling like something was weighing on her, breaking the illusion that had been following them for four days straight. She picked up on it, and she wasn't sure she could let it go. She raised a hand and gingerly tucked a strand of hair behind Agatha's ear, tilting her head as she did so to give her a gentle kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Do you want to talk about it?"
     </i>
     Rio breathed softly against her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     She could almost hear it, the battle of wills raging inside of Agatha. She was fighting herself, and with the conversation they'd had the night before, it left her wondering if Agatha had not quite believed her, or if this was somehow worse than she had thought it might be.
    </p>
<p>
     "Let's sit," Agatha suggested in a gentle murmur, though a spark of rememberance flashed on her face. She paced over to her bag, rummaging through it for a moment before she let out a soft
     <i>
      aha!
     </i>
     and produced the bottle of brandy, still unopened, from the first night they'd spent at the hotel. She paced back over to the bed, sliding to meet Rio in the center of it, the food suddenly irrelevant as it sat on the nightstand.
    </p>
<p>
     For what felt like the first time -- or at least the first meaningful time -- in their relationship, Rio was the one who lifted her hand and turned it over, palm side up, and held it out to Agatha. She could sense that Agatha had not even shifted to look at it, but met it with her response immediately. Rio threaded their fingers together, giving a soft squeeze as she leaned a bit of her weight into the woman next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     The silence was steady around them and Rio sensed that whatever this was, it was something Agatha was doing her best to summon her courage to bring up.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... When Colton and I divorced, ten years ago... I made a lot of really questionable choices. And I did that for years, bad choice after bad choice. By day, I was living my dream, making the films I wanted to share with the world. By night?" Rio could hear it, that wrapping of shame that twisted over her words. "There was just... this endless frustration that I had wasted so long of my life on someone who had never really cared about me, not actually. And so, instead of turning to copious amounts of booze, or drugs like my counterparts in the business, I let the door of my home become a revolving one of countless strangers that could... make me feel like I mattered for an hour at a time."
    </p>
<p>
     She gave Agatha's hand a gentle squeeze, as if to say
     <i>
      I'm right here. It's okay.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "I was selfish, in that time. I didn't take Nicky into consideration, and I... I know that even though he has probably tried to cope with it with countless hours of therapy, it was hard for him, and he probably still holds it against me."
    </p>
<p>
     The pieces were starting to fall into place in Rio's mind, but Agatha was not finished.
    </p>
<p>
     "He's been gone for three years. I had really fought myself on letting him leave before he was eighteen, but he couldn't seem to get away fast enough. In that three years... I've become a different person. And even more than that, I am certain that the me he just met? That woman is probably a stranger, in his eyes."
    </p>
<p>
     It all made sense in that moment. Nicky had struggled with the way she had coped with losing her marriage, and he had been too distant to witness any change in the time since he had made the choice to leave. What he saw, when he looked at Rio, was that revolving door swinging open again. But then, Agatha had put a name to it, and the shock had clearly displayed that he had been caught off guard.
    </p>
<p>
     Even with the revelation that Agatha was doing things differently, though, Rio could also see that because of such a reality, he did not know in what way to treat Rio. He had never been put in a situation where Agatha had placed herself into another relationship. As a result, he had no manual on how he was supposed to act.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was quiet for a moment, just watching as her thumb brushed over the back of Agatha's hand tenderly. The thoughts were rolling, swirling, and she was trying her hardest to find the right ones, to find a way to say the right things.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I guess what you have to ask yourself is... Is the you he just met the one you want him to know going forward?" Rio posed in a soft murmur, though her tone was so smooth and gentle.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to absorb the question, soaking it right through to her bones.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know that I can be anyone else, anymore."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head, her eyes sweeping over Agatha's profile before she reached across them. Her hand lifted, her fingertips catching the other woman's chin ever so softly, beguiling her to look up.
    </p>
<p>
     Those blue eyes met hers and Rio's palm slid to cradle Agatha's jaw, her thumb brushing tenderly over her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Maybe... maybe you should talk to him. Just... be honest with him. He's probably just feeling a little confused, and I think that if you explain things to him, it might help bridge that gap a little bit."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha breathed an almost sardonic huff of a chuckle, though the tenderness on her face didn't really match it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So... do you just carry around a book called 'all of the right things to say,' or is it just natural for you?"
     </i>
     she posed in a rich whisper, tilting her head in adoration at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "No, I just thought about the other night when Estee texted me and you encouraged me to go outside and talk to her. I realized that even though it's hard, communication with our kids can make or break how they feel about us."
     </i>
     Her lips pressed together for a moment before she found it in her to continue, though the humor danced in her eyes.
     <i>
      "I didn't realize at the time that I'd be able to spin it back on you so soon though,"
     </i>
     she added in a quiet, smooth purr.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't know if I like it when you use my own logic against me,"
     </i>
     Agatha grumbled, though Rio could hear in her tone that she was not actually upset, just perhaps a mixture of smitten and annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     Without a word, Rio closed the space between them with a tentative kiss, though she didn't hold it for long. It was more of a morale boost than anything else.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Go,"
     </i>
     she whispered, stealing one more soft peck.
     <i>
      "Go talk to him."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had every intention of listening, but she didn't immediately move. She simply found that deep pit of reverence that seemed to reside within her, pouring out of her as she watched Rio with curious intent.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you, you know?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, warmth washing over her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know. And as you are well aware, I love you too. Now, stop stalling,"
     </i>
     she teased with a breathy giggle, deciding on one more gentle show of affection as she took one more kiss, letting it linger for just a moment before she pulled away.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked across at her, helpless, but she knew she had been tasked with an important mission, and she needed to prove to Rio that she was brave enough to carry it out.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched as Agatha slid off the bed and paced over to the door, though she hesitated at the threshold, turning to look back at Rio for one more moment, doing what she could to find the solace she needed for the conversation ahead. Rio gave her a comforting smile and a light nod of her head in silent encouragement.
    </p>
<p>
     Another beat of a moment passed between them, and just before she turned to disappear, Rio could swear she heard it across the room, but she was painfully aware that Agatha had not, in fact, spoken a word.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, it bounced around her head like it had been whispered into her ear.
    </p>
<p>

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     Rio's eyes had lingered on that door frame, replaying over and over again in her head the sight of Agatha walking out of it.
    </p>
<p>
     The sight of the woman she had fallen head over heels for, commanding and present as she had tipped her chin up, given her hair a shake, and marched on to face something that Rio entirely understood made her very uncomfortable.
    </p>
<p>
     It struck Rio as her eyes swept over the decor of the bedroom, noting every little minute detail in the catalogs of her mind, that when they had talked, that first night on her houseboat, Agatha had spoken about Nicky with such a tender care and affection. There had never been any reason to have some kind of inkling that perhaps the relationship was not all that it seemed at the very surface level of a casual conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     In a way, it made her sad. She loved her daughter more than she knew how to love herself most days, and the idea that there could be three years and thousands of miles of space between them? It hollowed out something in her middle, even just thinking about it.
    </p>
<p>
     She had sensed, although Agatha had not explicitly stated, that the tension there had a few more layers than what Agatha had just divulged to her. She knew that with the more time she invested into spending with Agatha, the more she would be able to peel, to get closer to the center. She knew she would earn the ability to see Agatha more clearly, if she just gave it time.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes, in their journey across the room, had fallen across the bed to that nightstand, and the two plates of food sitting atop it. She was pretty hungry, even if they had gotten distracted by discussing the weight of what had unfolded upon their arrival.
    </p>
<p>
     She shifted, moving so that she could reach across and grab one of the plates, pulling it to her lap. It wasn't a Michelin star meal, but Rio could very clearly see the craft that went into it, and something began to stir in her middle -- Agatha knew how to cook.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the silliest realization, and it was even more ridiculous how it made her fill with warmth, but it was just another small piece to the grand puzzle that Agatha was.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing the little piece of art had been nothing compared to tasting it. Rio knew that it wasn't a lot of ingredients, but the way they had been combined, the way the toasting on the bread was literally perfect? Even more warmth sparked through her at the next realization; Agatha really knew how to cook, and this was just a very little glimpse of that.
    </p>
<p>
     As she finished, she stared down at the plate, holding a debate in her mind. She needed water, but she wasn't quite sure of the limits here, of where she should go or what she should do. She stopped herself, though; it was stupid to even consider that Agatha might even be remotely upset with her if she chose to go to the kitchen and get herself a glass of water.
    </p>
<p>
     After a moment of debate that ended in her telling herself not to be an idiot, she slid off the edge of the bed, her feet hitting the cool hardwood. The plate was still in her hand as she began the trek down the hallway and stairs, nearly floating her way into the kitchen. The lights were still on, illuminating those pristine countertops and stainless steel appliances.
    </p>
<p>
     Everything about it was just so... composed. It was so very... Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned, surveying the cabinets for a moment, trying to see if she could guess where she might find a glass. She paced and, after only two other attempts, she found the location of the glasses and pulled one down for herself. She turned, moving toward the front of the sink as she put the glass beneath the tap.
    </p>
<p>
     At the same moment that she lifted the handle, something caught her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio both saw it through her peripherals through the window in front of her and heard it -- the door to the pool house flew open violently and Agatha came thundering out of it, a clear look of anger and frustration screwing up every single one of those beautiful features and also, at the same time, causing a pang of pain to ripple through Rio's chest. She didn't like seeing Agatha look like that, like she was hurting and covering it up with seething rage.
    </p>
<p>
     "You don't get to do that, Nicholas. You don't just get to fuck off to Dubai for three years with the
     <i>
      ever so
     </i>
     occasional visit or phone call, and then turn up here and think that you get to make snap judgements and lecture me on how I am living my life." Agatha's voice was loud -- as evidenced by the fact that Rio could hear her crystal clear from inside the house.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, you raised me to call a spade a spade, and you are being LITERALLY insane!" he shouted back, causing Agatha to whip on him, her finger raised in a pointed warning as she took a step toward him, but then seemed to stop herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "I get it, I do. I thoroughly wrecked a good chunk of your childhood. But gods be damned, Nicholas," Agatha managed, her tone bordering on exasperated, as if this were a conversation that had been turning circles,  "if I haven't fought to make myself better. I know I wasn't always the best mother, but I loved you, and I have
     <i>
      always
     </i>
     respected the fact that you're able to make your own decisions. Why is it that hard for you to give it back?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze shifted across the space to Nicky, who's eyes were wide and wild, as if he couldn't believe this were actually a conversation they were having.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe if you'd ever been anyone worth being respected in any given memory, it wouldn't be such a struggle," he bit back sharply, his voice bordering on hostile.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt it, at the same exact moment Agatha did, judging by the reaction. She looked like he had physically struck her, the pain immediate and visible on her face. Rio's own heart dropped somewhere far beneath the floor below her.
    </p>
<p>
     That hurt. That was vicious.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I don't know what you want from me, Nick. You told me you wanted me to be happy, and now that I'm happy, you take issue with how I got there." Agatha's tone was no longer a shout, but had lowered into something Rio could still hear. She did not miss the sting in her words, in the way she felt every inch of what he had said to her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're literally talking about spending the rest of your life with someone who is a complete fucking stranger. Mom, come on. You're smarter than that."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's stomach clenched, and she found herself gasping for a breath, feeling like he had struck her, too. Another jab, this time landing on both of them. Rio wanted to be thrilled with that small little bit of information -- that Agatha had literally told him she wanted to spend her life with her -- but she was too hung up on the burn his flames had left on each of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha put her hands up, palms out, shaking her head.
    </p>
<p>
     "I do
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     owe you an explanation about what goes on in my personal life, but fuck me for thinking it was a decent thing to do to try to just have a conversation with you about it. It
     <i>
      means
     </i>
     something to me, and I had hoped that might make it mean something to you, too."
    </p>
<p>
     Nick scoffed, rolling his eyes, flicking a hand at his mother dismissively.
    </p>
<p>
     The sheer amount of disrespect, it flared something in Rio. It wasn't just a pain, an ache for Agatha, who was clearly distraught by what was happening, but it hurt Rio, too. She was watching as this... this child completely eviscerated the one human being in the world who loved him without condition or stipulation. He was hurting her because he could, and Rio didn't understand it.
    </p>
<p>
     She also, decidedly, did not like it one bit.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio understood, from the point of view of someone who was overly compassionate, that what Agatha had chosen to do in her past had severely impacted Nicky in a negative way, a way that he was still actively holding against his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do what you want. But keep me out of it. Don't
     <i>
      ever
     </i>
     expect me to look at her, or anyone else you bring around like they'd ever be any kind of parent to me. You hardly are yourself."
    </p>
<p>
     And then, Rio felt her heart somehow slide even closer to the core of the earth. His words were so cold, so hollow. Rio could feel them reverberate in the very core of her bones, through each and every one.
    </p>
<p>
     He turned around and stomped back into the pool house, slamming the door shut behind him, leaving Agatha standing there, metaphorically bleeding out from every wound he had just dished. She was still, frozen in that moment of her pain. Rio could read it on her face, the way she was working to build her composure again, to piece it back together so she could head back inside that house, and back to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had just had the thought that she should probably go back up stairs, but before she could will any muscle in her body to move, Agatha's head lifted and their eyes met through the window.
    </p>
<p>
     Everything in Rio completely left her. There was no sense, there was no air, there was not even a single beat of her heart. She should not have witnessed that, should not have intruded on such a personal moment. She knew, in her own heart, that it would only help her in tending to Agatha's wounds, but she knew without a doubt that the way it would make Agatha feel? She could already see it, the glassing over of her eyes as she fought herself on whether or not to move.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio set down the glass on the counter top, her eyes not leaving Agatha's until she turned, commanding her feet to move. She paced over to the back door and gently pushed it open, her hand remaining on the handle as she held it open, her eyes lifting to take in the other woman. She tilted her head toward the inside of the house.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come on,"
     </i>
     Rio coaxed softly, her tone almost pleading. She didn't want Agatha to fight her, or put up a protest. She didn't want to watch her continue to struggle just for the sake of it, anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head hung a bit -- most likely from a sense of shame mixed with embarrassment -- but she heeded Rio's request, pacing across the concrete toward the door. She passed by her without a word, and Rio's chest tightened, her lips turning further down at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
     She shut the door and turned, watching as Agatha moved toward the stairs, but Rio reached out, gently taking hold of her hand and using it to turn Agatha toward her. She looked up at her, her own green eyes impossibly soft and earnest as she searched every divot in her face, trying to pinpoint a place to begin, somewhere she could start to begin to mend what Nicholas had completely torn down. She searched for a long minute, but what she found, it was the most honest thing she knew.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I... I'm sorry."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There were so many things that she could have been apologizing for in that moment, from the way she was sure she had not been meant to see that, or the fact that she seemed to be the main source of that discord. She could have been apologizing for the fact that none of this would have happened if they had never met, but she wasn't.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was offering a strong tie of empathy, of understanding that she had been hurt by the one person in the world that she had loved unconditionally for twenty years.
    </p>
<p>
     She could see the emotion in Agatha's eyes, brewing like a storm, despite the fact that she was fighting herself to keep her expression placid. She could see the struggle there, the strong urge to not be emotional, to not lose control.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pushed forward, leaning up so that she could place her lips gently to Agatha's cheek. She left them there, a firm and solid reminder that she was right there, right in front of her. It was a reminder that Agatha did not have to do this alone.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Let's go upstairs,"
     </i>
     Agatha suggested, and Rio immediately found herself in an active battle to try and stop the way her stomach lurched at the smallness of Agatha's voice. She leaned back so that she was entirely upright again, reaching to pull Agatha's hand into her own. She let the other woman lead them back up to the bedroom, but as they crossed the threshold, Rio pulled her to her again.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, though, she was quick in her movements to completely envelop Agatha into a firm hold, pulling her as close as she could possibly manage. As Agatha laid her head on her shoulder, a hand raised to cradle the back of her had, holding her gently there, though Rio's presence was softly commanding.
    </p>
<p>
     They stood just beyond the doorway like that for a long few moments, Rio's hand smoothing so tenderly over Agatha's hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt scared, but only because she didn't have a plan. She didn't know what to do, how to fix this, or at the very least, how to make Agatha feel better. She could see the pain his words had caused, could see that he had wounded her pretty badly. His words had been meant to cut, and that was exactly what they had done. They had absolutely shredded his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     Soundlessly, she released her hold and picked up that soft, gentle hand before pulling them over to the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     They each slid atop it and Rio did not waste any time in pulling Agatha into her, reestablishing that firm embrace, though one hand moved to rub soothingly at her back. Rio just wanted to help, just wanted a find a way to see that look disappear.
    </p>
<p>
     If she thought she could have kissed it out of her, she would have. If she thought that she could sit there the rest of the night, just talking or singing or whatever Agatha needed from her, she would have done it without any sense of hesitation. She would have gone to the ends of the work to make the tidal wave of hurt pull back into the ocean it had spilled from.
    </p>
<p>
     The soft sound of the television across the room filled the air, but for a long time, it was the only sound. The minutes ticked by and Agatha didn't so much as twitch as she was there so steadfast against Rio's side, tucked into her, her cheek pressed just above the steady thump of Rio's heart. In fact, after enough time that nothing else seemed feasible, Rio's eyes swept down and as she saw the small sense of serenity on Agatha's face? She realized she was asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head back a little more, her eyes sweeping up to the steep cathedral ceiling of the room, wet despite herself.
    </p>
<p>
     This was painful. This was almost as painful as watching Estee go through really hard shit in life, and Rio felt something stir at the idea that someone else who had been able to make her feel that way. She knew she loved Agatha, but in that moment, she felt like she could feel every single bit of her pain.
    </p>
<p>
     For a few hours, they stayed completely still like that, Agatha fast asleep against Rio's side, but Rio simply had not been able to quiet her tired mind. It had lapped, paced and circled over and over again, waffling between the sheer thrill and joy those first few days had brought and what this felt like, which was not the most favorable feeling in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached over and lifted her phone off of the nightstand on her side, seeing that it was a little after two in the morning. She sighed; she was still thirsty, and thinking about that glass of water still sitting on the counter top in the kitchen. A soft sigh passed through her lips and very slowly -- and with impossible care -- she removed herself from beneath Agatha, making sure she landed softly on the pillow that had been under them.
    </p>
<p>
     With deathly quiet footfalls, she wound her way down the hallway, down the stairs and crossed the space to the kitchen. She had glanced up to see that there was an odd refraction of light on the ceiling, but she did not realize where it had come from until she stepped further into the room. Her gaze swept over, realizing that the refrigerator door was open, and that there were a pair of legs protruding from the bottom of it.
    </p>
<p>
     She had tried to be soundless as she moved for the sink, noting already that her glass had been emptied and flipped, sitting on the plate she had placed in there earlier in the night.
    </p>
<p>
     Well, fuck.
    </p>
<p>
     She moved with a stillness that was inspired by fear, just wanting to get her water and scamper back up the stairs to hide away from anywhere he might be able to injure her, too.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't good enough, though. He shut the door and caught sight of her, his posture straightening, as if he were looking for a fight. She ignored him and filled her glass. As she turned away from him to walk the long way around, she heard him scoff and it really lit something up right in the core of her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned, which she could tell surprised him, and met him evenly with her gaze across the expanse of the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     "Look, you don't know me. And that is perfectly fine. And I don't expect you, or literally anyone in this entire world, to understand, but..." Her lips twisted, her brow knit tight as she debated on her next words. "Your mother loves you. She talks about you like you are literally every star in her sky. I obviously don't know you, or what your life has been like... But she's really trying. She loves you, more than you will ever be able to understand."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah?" Nicky snipped, his tone sarcastic. "And what gives you any authority to say that?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio offered him a smile; it was warm in its appearance, but there was a sense of certainty there, just beneath the surface.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because I have a daughter. And I know what it's like to be willing to do anything to know that she gets to live a good life. Maybe... Maybe letting you leave was her way of doing that for you."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched as her words landed, causing a bit of a dumbstruck look to flash across his face before it set again. Before he could open his mouth to say anything else, though, Rio turned on her heel and made her way around the island, heading right back up those stairs as she felt his gaze following her.
    </p>
<p>
     When she returned to the room, Agatha was still out cold, a soft snore sounding about three seconds after Rio had passed over the threshold. It caused a tender smile to bloom on her lips; even though she knew that the storm would roll back in the moment Agatha opened her eyes, she looked so... at peace, like the weight of the evening was no longer trying to drag her under.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio knew that she could have panicked, that she could have worried in their hours of silence that Agatha was shutting her out, there was something underlying that left her of a different opinion.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had never once asked her to leave. Even with that expression, that look in her eyes, she had never wanted Rio any further away.
    </p>
<p>
     She placed her water on the nightstand and turned to her bag, changing out of the clothes she had been wearing for the day and into something a little more comfortable. When she was finished, she laid back down, gently draping an arm over Agatha's back, her thumb absent-mindedly brushing at the fabric of her shirt as she tucked her face into the hair on the top of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew that she didn't have pretty much any of the answers that Agatha needed, but she was steadfast in her desire to do whatever she could to help on the search for them. She needed to find a way to soothe the injury, to nurse the burns that had seemed to cover her as a result of Nicky's white hot anger.
    </p>
<p>
     It hadn't taken much longer for her to fall asleep, pacified by the smell of Agatha's shampoo filling her nose, and the lingering reminder that it was there because she loved the woman she was holding onto, and that woman loved her, enough to stare in the face of her son and offer an unwavering defiance.
    </p>
<p>
     When she opened her eyes, the sun was gentle in the windows, but there was something noticeably different from when she had fallen asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn't in bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Sleepily, she sat up, gently grinding her knuckles into a closed eye in an attempt to wipe the sleep away. With another soft breath, she realized that there were definitely a symphony of smells circling through the air, from coffee to bacon to something that almost smelled like fresh bread. Her brow wrinkled in curiosity for just a moment before she flipped back the duvet and slid out of the bed. She paced to the bathroom where she brushed her teeth and made herself look at least half-way presentable in the event she had to face Nicky again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's caution was evident in her posture, in the weight of her step as she descended down to the lower level. Her eyes turned toward the kitchen; Agatha's back to her, but there was steam rolling above the stove and a fresh loaf of what looked to be sourdough sitting on a cooling rack on the counter next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slid onto one of the stools, just watching for a moment as she moved about, clearly doing everything she could to keep herself busy and not dwelling on the entirety of the night before. A little pool of guilt formed low in Rio's belly, a slight twisting of nerves that curled around her spine. She shouldn't have engaged with Nicky the night before. And if he had in any way informed Agatha, it probably had not settled well.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good morning, darling," Rio braved, her voice low but still holding a gentle sense of warmth.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha jumped in response, a startled motion that caused her head to whip over her shoulder, though the tension eased when she realized who it was.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good morning," she returned softly, finishing whatever it was she was tending to before she reached up to turn off the stove. She wiped her hands on a towel that hung on the handle of the oven and turned, greeting with a smile that, while still warm, was tinged with the heaviness of what they had experienced before they had fallen asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     She paced back toward the island, pushing a coffee mug to Rio before she pulled the coffee pot off the warmer, moving to pour some of it into the mug.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you need any sugar or cream?" Agatha asked, that tender tone pulling at Rio's heart.
    </p>
<p>
     "I like my coffee black, but thank you." Rio offered a small smile as she pulled the mug into her hands, letting it warm her palms. Her eyes lifted to Agatha's face, holding with them the full empathy she felt for it. "I... I just want you to know... that if anything has changed, and you need your space back, it's okay. I just--"
    </p>
<p>
     She was cut off as Agatha raised her hand, a gentle request for her to stop.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't want you going anywhere," she assured her, pressing her lips together. "I just... Can you maybe bear with me while I just... get it back together again?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's whole demeanor softened exponentially, her hand reaching across the countertop to pick up Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
     "You'll find that patience is... kinda my thing." The smile that filled Rio's expression was warm and bright, a way to reassure Agatha that she was still right there, still steady and resolute.
    </p>
<p>
     "I..." Agatha started, but she stopped herself, pressing her lips together. "I'm really sorry that's how that went. I... had hoped it could be better, under different circumstances. I... guess I didn't realize just how angry he still was."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her hand a light squeeze, her eyes never wavering.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's alright, Agatha. You don't have to explain it to me."
    </p>
<p>
     "I know, but if it made you feel even half the way it made me feel, we're a right miserable pair."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let go of Agatha's hand and pushed herself to her feet, making her way easily around the length of the island. Her arms raised and slid perfectly snug right around Agatha's middle as Rio hugged herself to her, squeezing her tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "At least we're together?" Rio posed, to which she felt Agatha's lips against her head.
    </p>
<p>
     "At least we're together."

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     By the time they had untangled from their warm embrace, in which Rio was silently willing every bit of healing she could muster as if it could transfer like osmosis from her form into Agatha's, Rio's attention had been drawn to Agatha's previous task.
    </p>
<p>
     As she looked to the side, she saw the fruits of her labor; there was a pan with for perfectly cooked over easy eggs, one filled with a mixture of potatoes and peppers, and laid out on a baking rack was cooked bacon. Oh, and there was that damn loaf of bread. Rio's gaze swept from the spread, landing on Agatha's sheepish grin.
    </p>
<p>
     "When the hell did you have time to bake a loaf of bread?" Rio asked, the light of incredulity dancing in her eyes. The amusement curved her lips upward, ever so slightly, as if trying not to give herself away.
    </p>
<p>
     "When I woke up and, even though your thumb was still moving on my back, you were snoring," Agatha responded, entirely non-plussed. Her grin spread like wildfire, though, torching something in Rio's chest in the same moment. "I figured that you had probably
     <i>
      just
     </i>
     fallen asleep, so I didn't want to wake you. But... busy hands make idle minds?"
    </p>
<p>
     The expression on Agatha's face scrunched as she said it, as though it was something she had just made up to sound like she was being poetic, but it sounded like utter bullshit. They locked gazes and immediately burst into laughter, hands on arms across the space between them to keep steady.
    </p>
<p>
     "Come on, let's eat. Bread should still be warm," she offered, tilting her head toward the stove.
    </p>
<p>
     They had made their plates and placed themselves at one end of that unreasonably long dining table, their knees bumping occasionally with the way they were sat, closer toward a corner. Rio sensed, though, that the spot Agatha sat in at the end of the table? That was her throne. That was where she found her power. Rio was sure that table was used for more than meals; she could see it in her mind like a vision: Agatha with a small cluster of others, papers strewn across the table as she pointed, gave orders, watching as the pieces all fell into place to bring life to the vision that lived in her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     From the end of the table, Agatha could see whatever the world put in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then? Well, it just so happened to be Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Halfway through their meal, Agatha leaned back in her chair a bit, chewing thoughtfully on a piece of bacon. Rio watched her, for just a moment too long. She could see it as the light began to dim, ever so slightly, and the clouds begin to roll in. She was quiet for a beat before she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "Penny for your thoughts?" she offered, quirking a brow in mild curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's attention seemed to snap back into the moment, her gaze casting across the small space of the corner of that table. Her lips twisted, but then the clouds rolled out and her eyes lightened to that familiar warm blue. It was funny, Rio thought. Blue had been taught as a cool color, on the spectrum, but she couldn't have disagreed more. That blue? The ones when she caught glimpses into Agatha's very soul? That blue couldn't have been warmer.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have a couple of conference calls that I need to take from the office in a couple of hours... And in full interest of recognizing that you are your own entity with your own autonomy and not a puppy that has to follow me around all of the time, I would like to ask you what you would like to do." Agatha sat back up, her gaze zeroing in on Rio,
     <i>
      looking through her again.
     </i>
     "You are more than welcome to come with me, but you don't have to." She paused, her expression softening the slightest bit. "You are also welcome to stay here, though I think I know you well enough at this point to gauge that you would probably be uncomfortable with that. So, as a third option, you are more than welcome to take the car and explore, if you would like."
    </p>
<p>
     There was this strange feeling that wound through every inch of Rio's being, as she sat there and listened to what Agatha had to say. There were a few things to dissect there; Agatha had really hit the nail on the head -- several times. She was offering her a choice, options. She was under no pre-conceived notion that although yes, Rio was there for her, but she also did not have to dedicate every single moment to being together. Second, she had been spot on, knowing that the idea of being alone in the remote vicinity of Nicky was not exactly something she would clamor at the chance for. But the third offer? That was the one that churned Rio's the stomach the most.
    </p>
<p>
     In that moment, looking into those eyes she wanted so badly to drown in, she realized something incredibly striking, and perhaps bordering on embarrassing.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't really have any desire to see anything the city had to offer if she wasn't also afforded the opportunity to see it through Agatha's lens, at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand lifted, landing on Agatha's where it was resting on the table, that light brush of her thumb trekking over her skin. Her green eyes studied her own movements for a moment and then lifted, looking at a face that -- as much as she never would have admitted it -- looked like it could be her home?
    </p>
<p>
     "I want to go with you."
    </p>
<p>
     The reaction was instant, Agatha's smile spreading, moved and bright. But then, something flickered in her eyes; it was that ornery spark.
    </p>
<p>
     "Does that mean you're bringing your book?" she posed, her tone a little lower, a little thicker as she raised a lone brow.
    </p>
<p>
     The heat on Rio's neck was instant, and she could feel as it blossomed on her chest, too. There was an instant smirk across her face, her eyes dancing with their own light.
    </p>
<p>
     "I suppose I'll need my glasses, too?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked, as if the sudden realization had hit her. She clucked her tongue, pursing her lips as she looked away dramatically.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was watching, hanging on the playfulness of the moment as she chose to play the game Agatha was laying in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is something wrong?" Rio cooed sweetly, leaning a little over the corner of the table.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression scrunched, as if she were focusing hard on recalling something just beyond her reach. Her hand raised, reaching up to tap a finger to her lip in thought.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, actually," she finally answered, her head turning back to match Rio's stare that had never once moved. "I
     <i>
      distinctly
     </i>
     remember telling you that you should
     <i>
      never
     </i>
     take those off."
    </p>
<p>
     Both of Rio's brows shot up in amusement, her laugher instant. "Aye, so am I just supposed to sleep in them, too?" she asked back, tilting her head in an adorably interrogative fashion.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a shrug of her shoulders as she popped the last bit of her bacon into her mouth, somehow managing to hold a deliciously predatory smirk that sent a thrill coursing through Rio's veins. She flipped her hand over beneath Rio's and gave it a light squeeze before she stood, scooting the chair back as she did so.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she let go, though, she leaned down and pressed an affectionate kiss atop Rio's head.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm going to go shower."
    </p>
<p>
     She let go and grabbed the now-empty plates with a soft thanks from Rio, who had turned her attention to the remaining bit of coffee in her mug. As she was mid-sip, though, she glanced toward the stairs as Agatha crossed into her line of sight. By the time her foot hit the second step, her arms were crossing her front. In one deft, quick movement, she pulled up and stripped the shirt off of her torso, her bare back a valley of muscle and skin that Rio often ached to get lost in, in the quieter moments.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment it actually processed in Rio's mind? She exhaled a sharp sigh into her coffee that bubbled and splashed it both inside the cup and also flecking out to leave a few drops on her upper lip an chin.
    </p>
<p>
     She lowered it with haste, immediately reaching up to wipe at her face, her eyes still practically bulging out of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     She had disappeared up the stairs, which left Rio thankful for a moment to recover, but then it sounded, a bolt of lightning launched from Agatha's position, piercing straight through Rio's middle:
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Well, are you coming or not?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     Those showers? They had become a safe haven for Rio in a way she had never thought was possible. When they crossed from cool air to the warm flow of water? It was like the moment that door closed, nothing else existed. It was just the two of them, no one and nothing else.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the earlier conversation, they had managed to keep the shower short and oddly focused -- for the most part. At one point, Rio's hand had begun to wander, but Agatha had stopped her, that admonishingly gentle clicking of her tongue. Rio had let out a whine, but as Agatha had taken her up by the face and kissed her like she was intent on pulling every last breath from her lungs? It was what she had said that had seared into her the most.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You don't get to ruin my plans this time."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It had sent a shiver of pure thrill up Rio's spine, and it had probably given off the opposite of the intended effect. In fact, it took almost every drop of self-restraint Rio had to keep her mind from wandering about what, exactly,
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     meant.
    </p>
<p>
     In fact, even as they rolled through the city in the back of Agatha's town car, she still couldn't get it out of her head. She had seen that look in her eyes, like she could have swallowed her whole, devoured her, but she had practiced
     <i>
      far
     </i>
     more restraint than Rio had wanted to. Agatha was the one running this game, and Rio was just rolling dice, like the numbers that turned up could determine the course of action they would take.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had never spent so much time in elevators as she had since she had set foot in LA, but they were often filled with the physical closeness of Agatha's arms wrapped around her shoulder, sometimes peppered with the occasional kiss to the side of her head. They were quickly becoming one of her favorite softer moments of isolation. In that elevator, it was just them. In the elevator, anything could happen and no one would know.
    </p>
<p>
     The had filed into Agatha's office, but she had done something that she hadn't done before, which was close the door. Right then, it seemed nothing more than just a little difference, and she attributed it simply to the fact that Agatha had said she would be on calls and probably wanted to eliminate any extra noise.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had cozied up in her spot --
     <i>
      her spot
     </i>
     -- on that plush white couch in Agatha's office, her knees pulled toward her chest and her book resting on the tops of her thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     She would hit a good run, get through about ten to twelve pages, and then her mind would start to wander back to their shower that morning. She wasn't upset -- by any measure -- but Agatha was clearly up to something, and even thinking about it? She could feel the dull thrum kick up between her legs at the same time the pink clawed its way up her neck. She would tuck her chin a bit further and spend the next five minutes trying to coax herself back into an attempt to immerse herself in the story instead of losing herself in the mental video she'd taken of Agatha bare, in the shower, in that hotel bed, walking up those stairs.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      FOCUS!
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     And it would last all of another ten to fifteen pages. Each time she glanced up, Agatha was deeply immersed into the meeting that was on her laptop, but she had an AirPod in, which meant Rio was only able to hear half of what was being discussed, though she wasn't paying too much attention. Well, except for every time the word 'Auckland' came out of Agatha's mouth, drawing a pointed stare accompanied by a smirk from Rio every single time. And every single time, Agatha met her eyes across the room, that same pink creeping up the sides of her neck ever so slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, like a flash, she would remember that she was in the middle of a meeting and would snap back to attention, though the pink sometimes reached her cheeks, too.
    </p>
<p>
     The meeting drew to a close and Agatha reached forward, closing the laptop. She leaned back in her chair, her gaze sweeping over to take in Rio, still propped on the couch, focused on the page in front of her, for once.
    </p>
<p>
     "One down, two to go, but I have about an hour and a half until the next one. We can order something to eat, if you want," she offered sweetly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up a bit, letting her legs extend the length of the couch as she raised her arms in a bit of a stretch. She reached up, sliding her glasses on top of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you know what I've always heard about but know nothing about?" Rio posed, a little smile spreading.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tilted her head in question, as if encouraging her to continue.
    </p>
<p>
     "If I fuck this up, do
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     laugh at me," Rio warned, tipping her head forward to accentuate her point, though she was still smiling. "American Bar-Bee-Que," she pronounced deliberately, and she could see it in Agatha's eyes before it touched her lips; the laughter dancing there like lights in the sky.
    </p>
<p>
     She covered her mouth in an attempt to stifle it, but it bubbled out of her, a bright and beautiful sound that echoed off of the walls of Rio's soul.
    </p>
<p>
     Her face puckered in mock distaste as she exhaled in a huff, her arms crossing her middle like a scolded child.
    </p>
<p>
     "I said you
     <i>
      weren't
     </i>
     supposed to laugh," she whined, her bottom lip jutting out in a pout.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, but to be fair, that was probably
     <i>
      the
     </i>
     most adorable thing I have
     <i>
      ever
     </i>
     seen in my entire life," Agatha returned, leaning forward on her arms across the desk, her eyes seeming to drink Rio in. She raised an arm, giving a gentle flick of her hand. "No tall order. I'll get us Bludso's. Do you have a preference, chicken or beef? Their brisket..." Agatha tipped her head back, an
     <i>
      oh!
     </i>
     sounding that sucker punched Rio right in the middle escaping her lips. "It's to die for," she added, lowering her head again.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know," Rio mused, though she had slid her glasses back on and looked down at her book, idly flipping a page she hadn't read yet, more for effect than anything else. "The fact that you have not
     <i>
      one,
     </i>
     but
     <i>
      two
     </i>
     more meetings is... pretty annoying," she mused, though it was clear by her tone that she understood.
    </p>
<p>
     She reached up and gave a gentle tug on the tie that had been holding her hair into a secured bun atop her head, shaking her hands through it as it dropped down over her back and shoulders. Her eyes, over the top rim of her glasses, caught sight of Agatha, and it caused a smirk to fill her face.
    </p>
<p>
     There, phone in hand with a finger poised over it, Agatha sat with her jaw slack, her mouth in a 'o' shape. The hunger hadn't quite arrived -- yet -- but there was this utter look of awe and complete reverence written clearly across her face. It lit that match in Rio's stomach and she didn't even try to temper the blush that found her cheeks, bright crimson.
    </p>
<p>
     "Aren't you supposed to be ordering food or something?" Rio teased, her nose scrunching to accentuate her point.
    </p>
<p>
     Something was stirring in Agatha, that much was very apparent, but at Rio's question, she seemed to realize that she had been staring -- no,
     <i>
      literally ogling
     </i>
     -- and had not completed the task she had started. Her free hand raised, a much gentler finger than the one Rio had seen the night before raising to point at her as Agatha chewed on her bottom lip.
    </p>
<p>
     "You... You woke up feeling ornery this morning, didn't you?" she questioned, though that little smile playing at her lips gave her away -- she was eating up every minute of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio offered a shrug, to which Agatha had rolled her eyes, doing her best to turn her attention back to completing their lunch order.
    </p>
<p>
     "There! Should be here in twenty." Agatha leaned back in her chair again, exhaling a content sigh. "Any ideas on how to kill twenty minutes?"
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio perked, sitting up a little straighter. "Well, that depends..." she mused, closing the book in her lap. Agatha's posture stiffened the slightest bit, but she did not sit up in the chair. Rio placed the book on the couch by her legs and turned, placing her bare feet on the soft carpet.
    </p>
<p>
     "We could... listen to music..." she offered, another deliberate step. "Or scroll our phones," another step. "Or maybe we could see if anyone has a newspaper to read." By the time she finished speaking, she was directly beside Agatha's chair, raising a finger to push at the uppermost part of the chair so that she would swivel in place.
    </p>
<p>
     As she reached an adequate position, Rio made her move. Fluidly and with honed-in precision, she lifted a leg and swung it over both of Agatha's, setting herself directly in her lap. As she met her gaze, she could see a delicious swirling of both hunger and wonder.
    </p>
<p>
     "Or maybe," she offered in consideration as a hand raised to twist a strand of Agatha's hair around her finger. "We could see how far into that twenty minutes we can get by ways of making out before one of us passes out from lack of oxygen?"
    </p>
<p>
     The look on her face was an adorable twisting of her features, as if she were genuinely curious which option Agatha would choose, though she'd known before she even started listing them off. She got her answer, though, not a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hands fell to her hips, a firm grip that actually caught Rio off guard, eliciting a delighted squeal. She was sitting up, their chests colliding with just enough force that Rio wavered slightly, bending back half of an inch before she righted herself again. One hand was off Rio's hip in an instant, raising to cup her jaw as she pulled her in for a kiss that was yes, warm, but then quickly elevated in heat.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio had bared enough teeth to catch Agatha's lower lip between them, the whimpered moan that rumbled out of Agatha left Rio feeling more desperate for her than she had in the shower that morning.
    </p>
<p>
     As the minutes ticked on, they had worked as hard at fulfilling their goal as they could, though every time Agatha pulled back to gulp in a solitary breath, Rio always took the time to goad her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You must be a terrible swimmer."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "That's all?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Take a deeper breath."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could tell that each one landed exactly as she intended by the way Agatha would grab at her, smashing their lips back together again and again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been completely occupied by the way Agatha's tongue was exploring every crevice of her mouth when there was a sharp rapping at the door. She pulled away in an instant and the whine from the other woman? Rio briefly considered running to grab the food, tossing it aside and bolting back to bend her right over that desk.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Show some self-control, for fuck's sake.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She reached up and ran an almost taunting finger up Agatha's throat to just under her chin, not missing the way she tilted her head back the slightest bit.
    </p>
<p>
     After another brief moment, she removed herself from her perch on Agatha's lap and flitted over to the door, pulling it open to thank the assistant who handed it over. She shut it again and sauntered back over to her, placing the bag on her desk.
    </p>
<p>
     "Still hungry?" she posed, her tone thick with her smart-aleck demeanor.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, ravenous," Agatha answered, her eyes never leaving Rio's face.
    </p>
<p>
     The corners of Rio's eyes wrinkled instantly with her grin, but she gave a shrug that feigned innocence. "Suppose we should eat, then, before your meeting in... half an hour?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tucked the edge of her lip between her teeth, as if she were having a debate inside of that beautiful brain of hers. With a dissatisfied resignation, she heaved a sigh and reached over to untie the bag.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hm," Rio exhaled, watching her as she worked, pulling boxes and containers out.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes snapped up. "Yes?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh nothing," Rio offered, very reminiscent of when Agatha had underhandedly called her bossy. "I guess I'm just rather impressed."
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh?" Agatha raised a brow. "With what, exactly?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached down, picking up one of the plastic wrapped sets of cutlery, toying with it idly in her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     "That steel trap you've got locked on your self-restraint. Truly, incredibly impressive."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips twisted, her eyes a little darker, but it was not the same storm Rio had been seeing since the night before. This one crackled and burst with lightning.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, well," Agatha said, forcing herself to sort through their meals. "I'm kind of regretting not keeping a spare pair of panties in my desk."
    </p>
<p>
     A delighted spike of a thrilling rush shot throughout Rio and her own eyes flashed with her mischief and glee.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha finished opening everything, there was this one split second, but Rio had caught it. Agatha had stared straight ahead at the spread in front of her, and
     <i>
      her jaw clenched.
     </i>
     That was new. Suddenly, Rio was piecing together a whole new puzzle; it was an inner battle. Agatha had a duty to her career, and it was the entire reason they were there, but it became so glaringly obvious in that one little gesture, that there were plenty of things she would have rather been doing -- the majority of them to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned down, placing the softest of kisses, something reminiscent of the flutter of a butterfly's wings, to Agatha's cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     As she stood, though, she realized that she was going to have to go back to the couch. Even though she wasn't looking at Agatha, it was almost like she could sense the frown that pulled at Rio's lips. She rolled back slightly and gave a light tug on the hem of Rio's shirt. When she acknowledged her, Agatha gave a soft pat to one thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     The smile that found Rio was warm and instant, a fondness settling once more in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     She had placed herself on Agatha's knee and they had set about their meal, which was so impossibly good that Rio could hardly wrap her mind around it. Agatha had been right about that brisket; it was to die for. As it was turning out, there were quite a few things Agatha was right about, almost as if being wrong was not in her nature.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they had finished, Rio had found herself scooting back a bit, but then took it the extra step and laid back, flush against the front of the other woman. Like second nature, she felt those strong arms around her middle, holding her close.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You know I have a meeting in four minutes, right?"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured lowly into her hair.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I do,"
     </i>
     Rio answered back, her voice rich.
     <i>
      "But I know you're thinking about how good a nap on that couch would be right now, just like I am,"
     </i>
     she added with the lightest dusting of a giggle.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hold released and her hand lowered, swinging up to give a light swat to the bit of Rio's ass that was available due to the way she was straddling Agatha's leg.
    </p>
<p>
     "Up you go," she goaded with a soft laugh. "And by the way, for the love of gods,
     <i>
      please
     </i>
     stop being so
     <i>
      goddamn
     </i>
     distracting."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll try."
    </p>
<p>
     Somehow, they had made it through the rest of the afternoon into early evening, the sun on the verge of disappearing beyond the horizon. Rio had done her best to do as Agatha had 'requested,' even turning to face the other way at one point, which had caught her a Sharpie to the back of the head. She had turned around, that innocent expression on her face to see Agatha, screen of her laptop angled down, and a bemused scowl on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     She stifled her giggle as she had turned back around and returned to her reading.
    </p>
<p>
     For the third time that day, Agatha shut her laptop, but this time, she did not ruminate in her chair. Instead, she was on her feet in an instant, pacing a straight line directly to the couch. She arrived directly beside Rio, who did not budge, or even look up from the page in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, impatient, waved a hand out, as if she were expecting something.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes, so slowly, lifted from the page, though her head didn't move much. Instead, she peered up at Agatha from over the edge of her glasses. She reached up, hooking a finger around an arm of them to slide them down her nose the slightest bit.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can I help you?" Rio posed coyly. She could see it, practically boiling beneath Agatha's skin, the want, the desire, the hunger.
    </p>
<p>
     Wordlessly, she reached down, giving Rio's leg a firm tap, a clear direction in the gesture. Rio waited just a few seconds too long before she obliged, using her core to lift only both legs, an indicator that Agatha was more than welcome to place herself beneath them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha picked up on the invitation immediately and did as was requested of her, her hands falling on Rio's bare legs in those shorts as they lowered into her lap. Almost instantly, fingertips began to drag light lines, beginning at the hem of her shorts, trailing down over her knee to the midway point of her shin before doubling back. The action was immediate in its solicitation of the thousands of goosebumps that sheeted Rio's skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio adjusted a little so that she could reach up to drag her nails over Agatha's scalp, gently running through her hair. She watched as Agatha closed her eyes at the contact, her lips parting in a silent surrender.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think I quite like Business Agatha," Rio mused, and she watched as the bliss on Agatha's face shifted into something more toward the lines of a smile, though it struggled a bit to get there. "She's very no-nonsense. Authoritative.
     <i>
      Bossy.
     </i>
     " Rio's eyes sparkled with the cajoling, as if she were doing it on purpose, trying to provoke a response. All the while, the tips of her nails were still raking light lines through Agatha's hair.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh, Rio, is that your way of telling me you liked to be bossed around?"
     </i>
     Agatha murmued, her eyes still closed as she centered herself around that contact on the back of her head.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I wouldn't know, really. But I suppose the only way to know is to find out."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The moment the words touched Agatha's ears, her eyes flew open and even from her profile, Rio could see the heat burning there. Something shifted in her face, Rio watching with deep interest as the thoughts began to whip through the inside of Agatha's head. Something settled in her expression. As she turned to face her, Rio could see that it was a predatory hunger, a chance to wield a little bit of control.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio didn't know was that she had just played
     <i>
      right
     </i>
     into the hand Agatha had been holding since that moment in the shower that morning.
    </p>
<p>
     Their gazes stayed locked for a long, tense moment and Rio could see them, the words sitting at the very tip of Agatha's tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     When she finally spoke? It was a simple enough request, but her tone held weight, and it slammed into Rio like a careening train.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come,"
     </i>
     Agatha ordered, nodding down at her lap. There was finality in her tone; gone was the warmth of every other request for closeness. It was replaced instead with a tone soaked in ravenousness. It was like she had completely shifted gears in the blink of an eye.
    </p>
<p>
     For just a moment, Rio's smirk formed and she sat still, not moving a single muscle.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes flashed, then narrowed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio,"
     </i>
     she growled, sinking her fingertips into the flesh of Rio's thigh.
     <i>
      "I said come."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     A wave of heat tore over Rio from head to toe, causing her toes to curl. Her heart was suddenly racing and while she was curious what her defiance might bring, there was something in the thick hunger that had coated Agatha's tone that was compelling her to comply.
    </p>
<p>
     She swung her legs over the couch and rose to her feet, though she was quick to turn, looking down at the sight Agatha was before her. Her legs were spread wide, she was flush against the back of the couch, the frenzy burning in her electric blue eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward, placing each hand on either side of Agatha's knees, applying a little more force than was necessary to pin them together. She lifted her hands and placed them on Agatha's shoulders as she slid onto her lap, each of her knees locking aroung Agatha's hips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up, her hand sliding to the back of Rio's head, gently gripping a handful of her hair. She pulled Rio toward her so that she could place her lips directly next to her ear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Good girl,"
     </i>
     she purred in approval.
    </p>
<p>
     For a solid ten seconds, Rio felt like she had been shocked with enough volts to jumpstart a car.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      What the fuck was that?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     A soft whimper sounded from her lips as her tongue swiped at them to try and keep them wet. Suddenly, every bit of her mouth and throat was coated in sandpaper. How the fuck did Agatha do that?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hold on Rio's hair held a commanding presence as it pulled her back so that they were face to face. And then, in another move that stole Rio's breath, Agatha tugged on her hair, pulling her head back. As it turned out, it had been to expose more of the flesh she wanted to consume. Her lips dove into their feast of Rio's warm skin, kissing, sucking, biting. She was careful to not leave any visible marks, but she was most assuredly having her fun.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's chest had already started to heave and she was doing her best to keep quiet, not sure who else might have still been just beyond that door.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel, with each soft moan she somehow turned into a sigh, as Agatha's thumbs pressed harder into the front of her hip bones, her fingers sinking deeper into the supple flesh of her ass.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha..."
     </i>
     she whined.
     <i>
      "There's other people..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "No there aren't,"
     </i>
     Agatha rasped against her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Truthfully? Rio didn't know if she believed her, but as she felt Agatha's teeth catch the lobe of her ear?
    </p>
<p>
     She had absolutely zero reserves in fucking Agatha Harkness right there in her office.
    </p>
<p>
     With a dawning realization, she realized it had been Agatha's plan all along.

<p>
     If the feeling of Agatha's lips on her neck had not been enough to begin the process of unstitching her completely, the moment she felt the shifting of her shirt as Agatha's hand started to wander over the curve of her ass and fingertips brushed the bare skin of the small of her back?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was coming unglued -- quickly. Long gone was the self-restraint that she had been forced to hold onto throughout the day and what had taken it's place? A wildfire that was burning so hot she could almost feel it singe the tips of her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio sighed, a sound of desperation clinging to the lone word as it rung in the air around them. Her hands were still sitting idly on Agatha's abdomen, due to the fact that her motor skills were severely impaired by every skimming of teeth that graced her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, the wandering continued.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could find herself focusing on that fact too acutely, she felt Agatha's grip tighten in her hair, though she did not move her far. Instead, she lifted her own head to meet Rio's gaze with one that smoldered in its intensity. It made Rio's stomach compress in delight, but then in the next breath, swell with an insatiable hunger that she had never really thought herself capable of.
    </p>
<p>
     It was strange; this was a dance she had not dared attempt for over twenty years of her life, and yet it somehow felt like the most natural thing in the world. It felt like even though she had very little experience, Rio still had some form of a hold on how she wanted to please Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     What she had yet to realize was that, in the way as so many other unspoken things between them, she didn't have to hear Agatha say what it was she wanted when she could read it so plainly by just looking into her eyes. For as much as Agatha's voice often sounded in her own head?
    </p>
<p>
     Perhaps Rio's voice rang in the deepest echo chambers of Agatha's mind, too.
    </p>
<p>
     As that hard, sensual stare lingered between them, Rio regained some of her control and began to slid her hands over Agatha's torso, but she was stopped almost immediately as the hand that had been on her back flew forward, encircling both of her own, commanding in its grip.
    </p>
<p>
     Something in her eyes flashed, and then something Rio had never seen before filled her face.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a smirk, but it was a
     <i>
      devious
     </i>
     smirk, like she was finally getting the treasure she had spent a month on the sea for.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "No, no,"
     </i>
     Agatha chastised, her voice so low and rough that it caused Rio to suck in a breath, watching Agatha as she held it.
     <i>
      "Those stay put."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Another flexing of control, and another low whine that spilled between Rio's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's chin tipped forward and a brow raised, as if to silently probe that Rio understood the instruction. She received a huff of frustration in response, but it only twisted that smirk up even further. Her fingers twisted, tightening in Rio's hair as she held her steady and still for just a moment longer.
    </p>
<p>
     So painstakingly slowly, Agatha began to close the distance between them. With the fact that there hadn't been much, even a slow crawl should not have taken as long as Agatha was taking to get to Rio in that moment. Rio saw it, knew what she was doing, and it was absolutely working.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's breath was hot on her face, the lingering scent of spiced chai on her lips. She was nearly panting, now, and Agatha wasn't even really touching her. Not really. Not in the ways that would matter the most.
    </p>
<p>
     She could almost feel it, the faintest brushing of their lips, but before she could process it, there was a sharp spike of pain that stemmed from Rio's bottom lip, her eyes wide as Agatha's teeth sunk roughly into it. The moment they had a firm hold, she pulled her head back -- just enough -- and brought Rio's lip with it, letting go a moment later as it rolled back into place against her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's throat bobbed as she tried to force the intake and outtake of air, trying to use every bit of her recollection to just remember how to fucking breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     This woman was not just a flame, or even a crackling fire. Hell, even calling her a house fire felt like severely underselling it.
    </p>
<p>
     This woman was a volcano, filled with nothing but molten hot fire that was capable of incinerating anything she touched. She had learned to control that power, to apply the heat that bubbled inside of her in only the most necessary situations. Rio had seen it in her anger, but seeing it like this?
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing it like this made Rio want to melt into Agatha, to hide in her very bones.
    </p>
<p>
     The wanting in her pushed her to move, to press toward Agatha in desperate need of the feeling of their lips pressed together. The moment she began to lean, though, Agatha's grip tightened once more, pulling her back the few centimeters she had tried to cross.
    </p>
<p>
     Another ripping pulse coursed through every single inch of Rio's body, though she felt it most acutely between her legs. What had started as a dull thrum was now becoming a steady beat of a kick drum, the beater laying a steady rhythm against her willpower, stretched taut. If Agatha was not prompt in finding a way to touch her, she felt as though she was veering on the edge of possibly combusting.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
<b>
       "This,"
      </b>
</i>
     Agatha rumbled, that lightning striking in her eyes,
     <i>
      "is my temple. But here, I am the one who gets to decide those worthy of worship."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That need, that burning desire was practically bleeding out of her, and again, Rio was floored by the amount of self-control Agatha seemed to be gripping onto, almost as tightly as the hold she had on Rio's hair.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And decidedly, I've come to the conclusion that
      <b>
       you
      </b>
      are
      <b>
       my
      </b>
      deity."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The possessiveness, the yearning, the sheer desperation hung tight over every single word Agatha spoke, the stomp of that kick drum only seeming to intensify.
    </p>
<p>
     A low, pleading whine sounded from the hollow of Rio's throat and she shifted, her hips pressing downward against Agatha's lap, some frantic attempt at creating some form of friction between them. A laugh --
     <i>
      almost
     </i>
     sinister in its delivery -- sounded from Agatha's lips, though it was still soft. It was enough to tug harder at Rio's middle in sheer wanting.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been all but stunned to silence since Agatha's name had left her lips in that frazzled sigh, but as she stared straight into Agatha, she somehow managed to find her voice, low and sultry in its delivery.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So then, are you going to worship me, or what?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That ravenous hunger did not just fill Agatha's eyes. No, it filled
     <i>
      her entire body.
     </i>
     Rio could feel it everywhere, all at once as Agatha's whole body tightened beneath her. Every muscle seemed to ripple to attention, including the way her fingers were tugging on Rio's hair so close to the base of her scalp.
    </p>
<p>
     For just a moment, there was this softening in Agatha's eyes, and Rio was actually surprised at how it seemed to drown out the frenzy that had been burning there, if only for a moment.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I have prayed for you every single day of my life. Now that you're finally here, you get to see what true devotion is."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     For as tender as Agatha was being, that undertone was the loudest thing about what she was saying. Yes, it was an incredibly moving sentiment, but the way it made Rio wish that she could just dig her fingers into her own  chest and pry apart her ribcage to lay herself bare and open in front of Agatha was shocking in the disorienting jolt it had to offer.
    </p>
<p>
     What was there left to say after that? Nothing, Rio knew, and so, she decided to push those limits. Overwhelmed by the swelling of desire, desperation, affection and want, she surged forward, not really giving Agatha the time to react.
    </p>
<p>
     Their lips crushed, hot and bursting with the heat that had seemed to pool between the two of them. It was a rush of lips, tongues, teeth. The walls of that office had already started to absorb every sigh and moan that was hurled into them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's mind had been so locked onto the contact, to the feeling of their tongues trying to see who could assert dominance first, that she had not noticed at first as Agatha's tongue pressed into her own mouth. In an instant, it curled upward, dragging down the center of the roof of Rio's mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     She nearly choked into the kiss, forcing herself to pull away despite the fact that everything in her was begging her to keep going.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hummed, a low and hungry sound. Her next movements announced that she was tired of wasting time, although how much of a waste really was it when Rio was so soft in her palm, ready to be shaped and molded?
    </p>
<p>
     Her left hand relinquished the hold it had on Rio's hair, and her other hand released Rio's where she had been holding them over her stomach. Both of her hands reached in between the space across Rio's arms, using the backs of her hands to push them away, to the side, as they were not currently needed.
    </p>
<p>
     Her fingers wound into the fabric of Rio's shirt and she wasted not even a second in lifting it up the moment it was firm in her grasp. Rio complied by lifting her arms over her head, adjusting so that it could be removed. Once it was, the utter disregard Agatha had for it now was shown as she haphazardly tossed it aside, no longer concerned with it.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands were on Rio's body in an instant, causing her breath to catch as it swelled with the lodging of lust that happened in her throat. They roamed, searched, felt out every inch of skin they touched, exploratory but rapacious in their movement, her grip flexing every so often, causing Rio to exhale worked up sigh after worked up sigh, sounds that were slowly transforming into something else, into something that shouted her burning want at full volume.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio honed in immediately on the feeling of one of Agatha's hands sliding up her spine, the contact with her skin stopping as it slid over the clasp of her bra.
    </p>
<p>
     With an impressively deft accuracy, she somehow managed to free every single clasp with the use of only that one hand. Rio was certain that if she had not already been so turned on that she was convinced she might die if she did not get immediate relief, it would have only heightened it.
    </p>
<p>
     Those blue hues lifted to Rio's own green gaze, almost expectantly, though the heat was still simmering there. For a brief moment, they cast down to the garment still hanging loosely on her chest, and then raised to meet her evenly once more.
    </p>
<p>
     The silent command seemed to sink Rio yet again, her knees applying a firm pressure against Agatha's hips. Deliberately, Rio raised a hand, sliding a lone finger beneath the strap of her bra on the opposite side, pushing it so that it dropped over her shoulder. Not missing a beat, she moved to repeat the motion across the other shoulder before the bra fell, sliding into the crooks of her elbows.
    </p>
<p>
     With ease, she removed it the rest of the way, moving to discard it somewhere in the vicinity of her shirt. As she looked back down at the woman beneath her?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Agatha looked fucking starved.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The force with which Agatha used to swallow down the burning ache within her was visible as her throat bobbed. Her hands, that had landed on Rio's thighs, were gripping so tightly that the bruising had already started to form in the strands of her muscles.
    </p>
<p>
     They moved, though, up the rest of the way to Rio's hips, squeezing with need. A thought seemed to strike her, pinching her brow the tiniest bit, but it smoothed just as quickly, that hunger surfacing again.
    </p>
<p>
     Both hands lifted, finding Rio's as she took hold of them, applying a firm grip, though her stare never once moved. Slowly, she pulled Rio's hands closer to her and moved to nestle them on her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "They stay,"
     </i>
     she breathed in a sultry demand, her eyes so bright with that mischievous shine.
    </p>
<p>
     Swallowing down her own greed, Rio gave the smallest understanding nod, even though it was the biggest one she could manage. Her fingertips pressed down into the lean muscle of Agatha's shoulder, as if trying to brace herself for what followed.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward with careful intent, her eyes dropping to feast on the sight of Rio's bare chest. Rio felt it -- that hot curl of Agatha's breath -- against her skin, but before she could even think to have any kind of vocal reaction, Agatha placed a kiss that was directly centered between her breasts. At the same time, her hands had slid to Rio's back, palms flat against her flesh as she held her close.
    </p>
<p>
     As she began her task, Rio understood almost immediately what was going on in Agatha's head. The way she sucked, frenzied, and actually bit into her skin? Paying that kind of attention to visible parts of Rio's body was a dangerous game, and ran the risk of looking like they, two women in their forties, were nothing more than horny teenagers. As much as Agatha would have loved the sight, she did still have a reputation to uphold and if TMZ happened to post pictures of them walking down the street and Rio looked like she was wearing a cheetah-print ascot embedded into her skin? Well, it certainly wouldn't be the best look.
    </p>
<p>
     However, the parts no one else could see? Agatha was staking her claim, asserting with each new bruising of a hickey, or indentation of teeth that Rio was hers, and that she would know by the end of that night what it meant to ascend to godhood, if Agatha had anything to say about it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's mind was so filled with a pleasured fog that she hardly knew how to focus her vision, how to command parts of her body to do certain things. Every request, every command was drowned out by that solid, heavily pulsing beat nestled in the very center of her core. Her hands were gripping, almost deathly tight, at Agatha's shoulders the longer she peppered her body in a hungry affection.
    </p>
<p>
     Beyond her own cognizance, one of Rio's hands began to drift, sliding up the crook of Agatha's neck, beginning to venture into her hair when -- so suddenly it almost gave Rio severe whiplash -- Agatha stopped her current work at leaving a hickey just above Rio's nipple and whipped back, a hot warning flashing in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio,"
     </i>
     she let out in a chastising grunt, as if to correct the behavior. She did not otherwise move, completely frozen in every last one of her movements.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's jaw set in something she wanted to be playful defiance, but she knew that actually pushing back? That would do absolutely nothing to serve her, in the moment, though she did note in the back of her mind that it was something she would like to explore in the future.
    </p>
<p>
     In that moment, though, Agatha could have asked the world of her, and Rio would have bent over backwards to give it to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, the hand slid back into position atop Agatha's shoulder, the whine of disapproval low and long as it passed through Rio's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     In a burst of movement she had not been expecting, she felt Agatha's arm slide around her middle as she scooted forward toward the edge of the couch, holding Rio closely. Her other hand then moved to the underside of Rio's thigh, hooking tightly.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hold on tight,"
     </i>
     she whispered deliciously, her words sweet and hot like honey in the sun.
    </p>
<p>
     In the most graceful and fluid movement Rio had ever borne witness to, Agatha used every bit of muscle in her body as she lifted not only herself, but Rio with her, off of the couch to a standing position.
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately, Rio's legs moved to wrap around Agatha's hips, locking her position tightly. Her hands were still on Agatha's shoulders, and she found strands of hair tickling the side of her face as she looked down, the hair spilling over her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a shift, just for a moment, in the air between them. The way Agatha was looking at her? Rio felt like she might as well have been the only light in a otherwise pitch black existence. She knew that Agatha had not had a bad life, necessarily, but it had still been filled with its fair share of turmoil, but that look in her eyes?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt like the sun, like Agatha might go blind if she kept staring into her like that.
    </p>
<p>
     She dipped her head in an urgency that was gifted to her by such an emotion and met Agatha in another warm kiss. It was tentative at first, as if Rio were silently trying to gauge how long Agatha might be able to stand there holding her up like that. After only a few seconds, though, her tongue was pressing, pushing through the keep of Agatha's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     The moan that Agatha formed in response? Rio swallowed it whole, physically aching for another, and another. She couldn't have her fill; she was positively insatiable.
    </p>
<p>
     They simply stood there, in the middle of that office, with Rio's legs holding onto Agatha like her life depended on it, for both seconds and hours, but was really only a few minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     As they broke for air, though, Agatha began to move, began to hurriedly carry Rio across the room -- and right to that desk.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment one hand let go of her, Rio was already so impossibly turned on, but the way she burned never hotter at Agatha's display of strength by holding her in one arm? She was almost sure her heart was incredibly close to stopping its rhythmic pounding.
    </p>
<p>
     With that free hand, in what felt like something ripped out of some erotic novel she had once read on the deck of her houseboat, Agatha first moved her laptop, but then swept everything else off the edge, onto the ground. Once it was clear, she set Rio down, that hand sliding over the small of her back to her waist. Those eyes held in them a fervent want, but the kiss Agatha leaned in to steal?
    </p>
<p>
     It was
     <i>
      soft.
     </i>
     It was
     <i>
      undemanding.
     </i>
     It was
     <i>
      loving.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The hand on Rio's waist began to move, those fingertips light as feathers in their path. The other hand landed on the waist of Rio's sweatpants, a finger tucking into the elastic. The contact caused Rio's breath to catch in her chest, her lips parting against Agatha's in the throes of her gasp. Then, a finger on the other hand replicated the motion, and each touch slid outward, to her hips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips pulled away, but she was still so close.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Up,"
     </i>
     she breathed, but this was less of a demand and more of a pleading request.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did as she was told, her body shifting enough, and using the leverage her legs had gained in their hold on Agatha's body to lift her hips quickly enough that Agatha could slide the waist of both those sweatpants and her underwear over the curve of Rio's ass. She unwillingly untangled herself from her legs so that she could remove the garments in their entirety, flinging them away carelessly.
    </p>
<p>
     She stopped, though, not stepping back to reclaim the firm position she had been holding against Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she just... stood there, staring.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel the additional heat of a new blush forming, one that started between her hipbones and coursed up the entire length of her torso, dusting every spot on her stomach, breasts, and chest that wasn't already reddened.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn't just regarding her, wasn't just revering her. Agatha was silently worshipping every inch of bare skin she could see.
    </p>
<p>
     She seemed to catch herself, though, as she licked her lips and that unquenchable thirst returned to her expression. Slowly, she stepped forward, a hand falling between them as she kissed Rio again. Agatha, however, did not waste even a single second, the feeling of her fingertips gracing the little crease between the very inmost part of her thigh and the mound of supple skin of Rio's dripping core.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sucked in a breath so hard that she was sure she pulled it right out of Agatha's lungs with the way their lips were pressed together. The touch began to drift, to veer toward the center, and when it reached it's destination?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh! Fuck!"
     </i>
     Rio cried, unable to temper the ability to stay soft or quiet any longer.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel the devious chuckle Agatha breathed against her lips at the sound, but she was splitting her attention, also focusing on the absolute thrill that shot through her at just how wet Rio was.
    </p>
<p>
     The motion of her fingers was steady and persistent, but she could physically feel it in Agatha's shoulders as the tension began to build, and that look on  her face grew a little restless. There was a voracious want for more.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled her hand away and Rio's posture slacked slightly, but only for a moment. Instead as Agatha placed both of her hands on each of Rio's knees and pushed them apart? Rio was nearly choking on the air in her throat. It only seemed to get worse as Agatha dropped to her knees, that white hot insatiability refusing to flicker out.
    </p>
<p>
     She moved forward so that he knees were pressed to the base of the desk, and she raised her hands to cup the undersides of Rio's thighs. With little effort, she lifted them, securing them over her shoulders where she wanted them. Her impossible gaze lifted from beneath her brow, drinking in the woman above her like she would never have that thirst quenched.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand raised, her fingers running through Agatha's hair, realizing exactly what that look was.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was asking for permission.
    </p>
<p>
     Without any other movement, Rio's palm slid to the back of her head and applied the lightest pressure, as if to urge her on.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Agatha understood?
    </p>
<p>
     The moan that ripped out of Rio's throat as her head tilted back at the feeling of Agatha's mouth on her was far too loud to be absorbed by those walls. Instead, it echoed, bouncing around them like some sort of soundtrack to their unfolding.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had never felt so frenzied in her entire life. The entire time that she felt Agatha's mouth, her tongue, and at one point -- much to Rio's thrilled surprise -- even her fingers inside of her, she had literally no clue what to do with herself. One hand had acted as a kickstand, propping her up on the desk so that she could keep her vantage point of Agatha at work, but the other was restless as it ran through, gripped, pulled and tugged Agatha's hair.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a curling inside of her -- Agatha's fingers -- that seemed to reach exactly the right spot.
    </p>
<p>
     The moan she had let out before? It absolutely paled in comparison to the loud cry that poured out of Rio as she threw her head back, her body tensing in a collision of nothing but pure bliss and pleasure. What she had not realized in such a state was that Agatha had immediately pulled back, but not because she had
     <i>
      wanted
     </i>
     to stop.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio caught her breath and lowered her head, she almost felt a spike of embarrassment at what she saw.
    </p>
<p>
     There, on her knees, her shirt completely drenched, sat Agatha looking like she had won first place at every single award event for any single category in the entirety of the world.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What a fun surprise,"
     </i>
     she murmured, completely bewildered. Her tone was thick with just how hot and bothered she had come to be. The wonder was clear in her eyes, so vivid and bright in the way it shone.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I..."
     </i>
     Rio breathed as her chest continued to heave, clearly taken aback.
     <i>
      "I didn't know..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The look on her face seemed to strike Agatha, who's expression seemed to melt into something impossibly soft as she pushed herself to her feet. Her hand raised, so gently cradling Rio's jaw as Agatha looked down at her. There was a tenderness in her eyes, something that told Rio she meant what she was about to say.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Absolutely do not apologize,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed at her, still panting, like she was still trying to process that she'd done that, that she'd pulled that out of Rio.
     <i>
      "That was the hottest thing I have ever experienced in my life."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That shy heat washed over Rio again and she raised her own hand, fingertips grazing Agatha's cheek. She leaned in, kissing her fully, not a single regard to how she tasted on the tip of Agatha's tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     They clung to each other like that, in that flowing exchange of passion until Rio literally felt like her lungs were going to burst if she did not take at least five minutes to catch her breath. She pulled back, immediately pressing her face into the crook of Agatha's neck as she let out a pent up sigh, her lips grazing the skin there softly.
    </p>
<p>
     As she took a moment to collect herself, that hunger began to, instead, swirl inside of her like it had shifted right out of Agatha's form and crawled inside Rio's skin.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You know what I think?"
     </i>
     Rio mused in a rich, deep murmur that was thickly laden with the pleasure of the orgasm she had just experienced.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I think it's my turn."
     </i>

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     That low, guttural groan that echoed its way out of Agatha's throat?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt like she'd been absolutely doused in gasoline, and someone had lit a match, tossing it at her feet and watching as the heat of her lust and passion ate her alive, licking at every bit of her skin, burning its way from the tips of her toes to the absolute top of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     No, not
     <i>
      someone.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was the one, metaphorically stood there, and what was more? She was just toying with the matchbook, watching the orange and blues consume Rio whole, those lights dancing in her eyes with delighted satisfaction.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio reached up, she slid a hand along the side of Agatha's neck, though her thumb laid a light line over the slight protrusion of her throat, a barely-there grip that allowed her to regain some semblance of control over her ability to think and move. She used it as the slightest bit of leverage as she pushed back, begrudging in her motion to remove her face from where it had been nestled, the warm skin there.
    </p>
<p>
     However, when they met again, their eyes locking across the six inches of space between them?
    </p>
<p>
     Some astral form of Rio, the one that could see the Agatha who held the matchbook? She reached across the space and plucked it from her fingers, opening it to see just how many chances she was going to get to try to set Agatha alight.
    </p>
<p>
     The physical, grounded Rio? The one looking directly into this woman that she would have done anything for?
    </p>
<p>
     That Rio found her lips pushing up into one hell of a devilish smirk, one that caused the expression in her face shift
     <i>
      just barely.
     </i>
     Rio had caught it, though. It was almost the same exact one that first night in the hotel bar when Rio had called her 'Mommy Warbucks.'
    </p>
<p>
     The smirk twisted up further, her grip flexing ever so slightly on her hold there on Agatha's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     She gave a light tug, pulling her closer, closer. Even closer, until their lips were a breath apart. Rio had been committed, ready to send this full stop -- who was she kidding? Like she would pass up an opportunity to dish back a little bit of what she had been served.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the absolute lightest contact, so light that Rio almost wondered if she'd leaned in far enough, but the worked up sigh Agatha breathed out of her nose signified exactly what she had been hoping for. In a sudden movement, Rio's hand shifted and slid up, her thumb landing on the left side of Agatha's neck, securing itself in that little give of flesh beneath the corner of her jaw. Her fingers landed roughly in the same spot on the opposite side, affording her the power she had been seeking.
    </p>
<p>
     With their lips still
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     close, Rio flexed her hand and rolled her wrist in just the right way that Agatha's head was forced up and to the side, exposing every bit of flesh from below Rio's thumb, all the way down to the collar of the shirt she was still wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     Subconsciously, Rio ran the tip of her tongue along her bottom lip, as if she were staring at her first meal after a long fasting. She let her gaze lay the ground work; she saw every spot, every give that was going to make Agatha come unglued, and she was absolutely reveling in the few moments it took her to calculate her attack. It left her even more satisfied as Agatha let out a low whimper, as if begging her to just get on with it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sealed that space, leaning forward toward the showing of skin just beneath her collar. Measuredly, the tip of her tongue snaked out from between her lips. It made contact with Agatha's skin, causing her to suck in a sharp breath -- one that Rio took as undeniable approval. Slowly, it began a trek up the entire length of Agatha's neck, taunting in its speed and pressure.
    </p>
<p>
     As she reached the place where her thumb had come to rest, she lifted the touch, turning her head in a bit of a snap to catch the lobe of Agatha's ear in her teeth, giving it a playful tug, though the laughter in her belly did not make it past her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she released and her lips moved slightly, hovering just above Agatha's ear, her breath hot and deliberate directly onto it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tensed beneath her hold and Rio could almost hear her grip on the edge of that desk, the wood nearly splintering beneath the pressure.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You know,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed directly into her ear, the softest trace of a husky giggle flittering out.
     <i>
      "I have half a mind to strip you down and pin you to that glass."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could literally feel the ripples of goosebumps on Agatha's skin beneath her grip.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yeah? Not one to mind a little public exposure?"
     </i>
     Agatha managed lowly, though Rio could hear the excitement as it pulsed through her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "We are literally on the 48th floor,"
     </i>
     Rio rebutted, her lips still hovering dangerously close to Agatha's ear.
     <i>
      "If you're so concerned with some old man on the outside of town with his binoculars, I mean, I get it,"
     </i>
     she offered, though her tone betrayed her; it was a challenge. If she would have legitimately believed that it was a risk, she wouldn't have even brought it up. The idea of it, though? It caused her pulse to pound and her heart to jet off in a race against itself.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hm,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed through a huff out of her nose, causing Rio to do the same -- directly against her ear. The sheer act wound Agatha up like a top; it was literally tangible beneath Rio's fingertips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Something you'd like to share with the class?"
     </i>
     Rio purred, the roughness in her tone indicative of her curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's just too bad --" she had started to respond, but her breath hitched and she got entirely derailed as she felt the tip of Rio's tongue swipe along the edge of her ear. She swallowed, all too aware that Rio probably felt every single moment of it -- and she did. It caused that lascivious smirk to wind up her full lips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's too bad that you don't have a whole mind, instead of just half."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The gravity, the weight, the invitation, the challenge. They were all right there for Rio to take, to capitalize on.
    </p>
<p>
     Her fingers flexed as she rolled her wrist back to where she'd originally taken hold of Agatha's face and emerald eyes met cerulean, though the orange flames that licked the irises distorted their true colors.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha may have been starved, but Rio? Rio was absolutely famished.
    </p>
<p>
     Still gripping Agatha by the jaw, she pulled her into a kiss that had absolutely no hesitance, no reserves. Her lips were almost frantic in their desire to take more, to steal every last bit of what Agatha would part with. She wanted to hoard it, to covet it, to remember what it felt to live in that absolute state of pure, sheer bliss. She wanted to be able to recall that, even when she was old and gray, on a deck in a rocking chair, her hand meeting Agatha's in the space between Agatha's chair and her own.
    </p>
<p>
     In something that, for a moment, felt out of character, Rio felt this air of confidence with her. Sure, the two of them had been intimate during their stay in the hotel, but this? This was different.
    </p>
<p>
     This was primal.
    </p>
<p>
     This was raw.
    </p>
<p>
     This was carnal.
    </p>
<p>
     For once in her life? Nothing about that scared her. In fact, it absolutely aroused her in every single way it possibly could.
    </p>
<p>
     There had of course been times in her life when she would acknowledge that someone was good-looking, or that they were attractive. She had never actually been attracted to someone before in her life, not in a way that left her wondering what it would be like to break out of her bubble of isolation. She'd never had the desire, content in her own life, in her own circumstances.
    </p>
<p>
     That was, until some American director woman decided to get pushed off of a bridge.
    </p>
<p>
     And now?
    </p>
<p>
     Now, Rio was ready to absolutely gorge herself on every single thing that was Agatha Harkness, starting with that kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     While Agatha had been holding the reins previously, the entire ride had since been hijacked, and Rio felt absolutely maniacal with power, knowing that this was going where she directed it to go, and Agatha seemed to be holding on for dear life.
    </p>
<p>
     Their lips separated in a soft
     <i>
      smack
     </i>
     that drew a blending of whispered giggles from them both, but it didn't seem out of place in the moment. In fact, it was perfect. It gave Rio the time she needed to move on to her next plan of attack. She leaned back, sitting a little straighter on the desk as she surveyed the woman who was half-way leaned over her. The expression she wore, especially as she raised a finger to touch her chin, as if she were thinking really hard, displayed a nuanced curiosity that she could tell immediately piqued Agatha's interest.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes?" Agatha managed, her voice barely reaching a somewhat normal volume.
    </p>
<p>
     The tension had not shattered, though. Rio could see that much by the look in Agatha's eyes, absolutely wild.
    </p>
<p>
     "Just curious..." Rio began, moving her finger to tap at her lips instead. She straightened a little more, noting the couple of inches more it gave her over Agatha. "...as to how I'm sat here stark naked on this desk and you..." she indicated, the finger swinging through the air as she indicated Agatha's current state of dress. "...still have your socks on."
    </p>
<p>
     An amused light filled Agatha's eyes and she didn't seem to be able to fight the smile that found her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "My socks, huh? Nothing else?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pursed her lips, turning her eyes away, pointedly letting them land on the floor-to-ceiling windows to their left.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel it without seeing it: Agatha was staring holes in her, slicing right through her, but she was loving every single moment that Rio chose to be the one to puppeteer the game they were playing.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Still at half a mind then?"
     </i>
     Agatha questioned, her voice dropping. Rio's head whipped back, their gazes locking like a steel trap.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Hm,
     </i>
     Rio thought,
     <i>
      must be the one that used to be on Agatha's self restraint.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's head tilted to the side in silent interrogation, as if indicating that Agatha needed to elaborate on what, exactly, that meant.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I just thought that you know, since you offered, you'd be the one to strip me down. But, if you changed your mind..."
     </i>
     she trailed, and Rio was all too aware in the matter of a second as she started to actually push herself off of the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     In an instant, Rio's hands were up, grabbing at the collar of Agatha's blouse, not letting her get even an inch away. With the momentum of her grab, she pulled Agatha toward her, another hot and hard kiss that she felt in every inch of her bones.
    </p>
<p>
     Though she kept it up, there was a clear divide in her focus as her hands moved with finality down to the first button, managing to work it free. She repeated the process with the second, but it took longer than she wanted it to. By the time she started fighting with the third? She'd had it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh, fuck it,"
     </i>
     she nearly hissed into Agatha's mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     Both of her fists balled up the fabric on either side of the buttons and gave a hard yank, a satisfied chill racing up her spine at the sound of a couple of the buttons landing on the desk as they were ripped from the threads that had held them secure.
    </p>
<p>
     This brand new display of strength and dominance from Rio clearly slammed into Agatha like a speeding bullet. She looked breathless, looked like she couldn't believe that something like
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     had just come from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     That familiar smoldering coated Rio's skin once again and she enticingly raised both brows, as if to ask:
     <i>
      Didn't think I had it in me, did you?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio reached forward, curling a finger into the centerpiece of the purple lace that Agatha's chest was clad in, her eyes on the gesture rather than the reaction it would elicit. She didn't need to see Agatha's face, anyway. After all, the way her chest expanded rapidly in a tight breath? That was good enough.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Turn around,"
     </i>
     Rio requested, her tone far softer than Agatha's had been when she had jumped into that dominant mindset.
    </p>
<p>
     Though she stole a brief kiss before she did so, Agatha obliged and turned, even going as far as to pull all of her hair over one shoulder, which Rio was silently grateful for. It made what she wanted to do much easier.
    </p>
<p>
     She reached down, her fingertips pressing so gently into Agatha's sides, and pulled her back to leave just enough space between them so that she could move the way she wanted to.
    </p>
<p>
     Both hands raised and a fingertip of each pointer finger landed on both shoulders, atop that purple lace. Slowly, deliberately, Rio started to drag the pressure of her touch over the lines of those straps, down to the top of the band. They continued to move, to feel, to press along the edge of her skin beneath that band. They curved inward and met one another in the middle, a signal of what was about to come.
    </p>
<p>
     Methodically, and in the act of making Agatha want this as bad as she humanly could, she took her time in unfastening each hook, making a four second job last closer to about forty-five.
    </p>
<p>
     Once it released, her hands landed on Agatha's back, sliding up slowly to her shoulders, fingers smoothly gliding beneath the straps to push them down her arms. But what she did as she accomplished that feat? That was the part that caused Agatha to let out the most delectable gasp.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips had landed at the base of Agatha's neck, where vertebrae shifted from cervical to thoracic. It was the softest of kisses, just a brushing. The next one was a little lower, a little more firm. The path she was paving with her lips was a straight course down Agatha's spine. The lower she got, though, the more difficult it was getting to keep going.
    </p>
<p>
     She exhaled an annoyed huff, but in the next breath, had an idea. She reached up, a firm hand on Agatha's shoulder and let the other hand land on the opposing hip. At the same time, she both pushed on Agatha's shoulder and pulled her hip back toward her.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, not a gasp, but a low, rumbling moan.
    </p>
<p>
     Regardless, it had accomplished what Rio had set out to do, allowing her to kiss the rest of the way down her spine until she reached the waist of her slacks. She, herself, straightened back up and gave Agatha's hip a light pat to indicate that she wanted the same of her. As she did, though, Rio's arms snaked around her middle, their hands landing on the front of those same slacks.
    </p>
<p>
     As her fingers began to make work of getting them undone, Rio couldn't help herself as a wave of impulsivity seemed to wash over her, causing her to sink her teeth into Agatha's shoulder. Immediately, Agatha's hand flew up, landing in shock on the back of Rio's head. She hummed a soft laugh against Agatha's skin as she managed to slide down the zipper.
    </p>
<p>
     This, of course, allowed her the room she needed to tuck her hands inside, and inside the waist of Agatha's panties, pushing them down as far as she could, which happened to be about the same distance as where the give went out from the hold they'd had on her thighs. She stepped out of them at the same time she kicked her socks off.
    </p>
<p>
     And there they were, in every bit of their nude glory.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave another soft tap to Agatha's hip, a silent request for her to step forward so she could pull herself off of the desk, trying not to grimace at the puddle she seemed to have left in her wake. As she righted herself, she was only a few inches away from Agatha, who looked like she was absolutely about to burst with every bit of pressure that Rio had been pouring into her over the last minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     Gone was that cocky gleam in her eye as she was giving orders.
    </p>
<p>
     What was there now?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      That,
     </i>
     Rio could hear in the back of her head,
     <i>
      is what it looks like when someone needs you.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could have continued to play, to have her fun, but the time for games had passed. What Rio felt in that moment, staring across that minute space between them?
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to
     <i>
      take
     </i>
     Agatha. She wanted to
     <i>
      make her hers.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio shifted, ever-so-slightly so that she could sweep her lips across Agatha's in a light brush, but it was a very obvious precursor to what was coming. In an instant, Rio's hands were up, grasping Agatha's face like she couldn't bear the thought of her getting away, even by a breath. Their lips were colliding in this brand new outpouring from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been heat, there had even been tenderness. But that kiss?
    </p>
<p>
     It was a clear line of communication that Rio had every want in the world to absolutely ravage the other woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Tongues were wild and strong, the rapping of teeth reverberating through every possible sense Rio had, though she was still managing to find a way to both step into and steer Agatha toward the left, toward those windows.
    </p>
<p>
     The sounds of their moans and gasps could surely have been heard by occupants several floors down, let alone anyone who had not yet left the office, and Rio could not have given a shit less.
    </p>
<p>
     After what felt like too long and yet not long enough, Rio's chest bumped into Agatha's as Agatha's back pressed flat to the glass. Her hands were moving before she could even think about it, off of Agatha's face and down her neck, over her shoulders. She stopped halfway down her upper arms and curled her fingers under them, applying a light pressure that was coaxing in its request.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha obliged, raising them up, and even though she couldn't see it with the way they were drowning in that sweltering kiss, Rio could sense Agatha's question, but Rio was quick with an answer.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands shifted to the underside of Agatha's, about in the same spot, but then they slid further toward her hands the higher they lifted. As she reached her wrists mid-air, she wrapped her fingers tightly around them and pushed the rest of the way up, pinning them -- elbows bent -- to the window above Agatha's head.
    </p>
<p>
     The best part?
    </p>
<p>
     The best part was the way Rio's teeth rattled so hard from the force of Agatha's moan that she had thought for a moment they might actually crack. She shifted, moving her hold so that she could keep both of Agatha's hands pinned with one of her own, leaving the other to roam. She was immediately aware in that moment that she'd hardly actually touched Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Her palm landed flat on Agatha's sternum, but it didn't rest there long, moving down to cup her breast in her palm. Her thumb brushed tenderly over the supple flesh, and then her fingertips danced light circles around her nipple -- another crack of thunder that Rio gulped down with fervor.
    </p>
<p>
     Gradually, her touch wandered, the tips of fingers skating light lines over the peaks and valleys of Agatha's abdomen, gracing from side to side the lower they went.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Game time.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio pulled their lips apart, both of their chests heaving into the other. After another beat, Rio's hold on Agatha's hands released.
    </p>
<p>
     This was going to be a two-handed job.
    </p>
<p>
     The hand that had dropped, though, found Agatha's hip. With a casual coolness, it slid back, over the contour of Agatha's ass, down to the back of her thigh, which she gave a commanding tug on.
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately, the skin on the inside of Agatha's thigh was flush against the skin of Rio's hip, pinned there by the force of her own grip. Agatha's mouth opened, as if she were going to sound out, but nothing came except a sharp exhale of breath.
    </p>
<p>
     When that ever wandering touch sank lower, and Rio eventually found the home she'd been making her way returning to, though? It was hot, soaked in levels of pleasure that Rio was not sure she could even register in her brain. The moan that accompanied it registered at about the same level of heat.
    </p>
<p>
     As she began to explore and find a suitable pace, Rio's mouth fell hungrily to Agatha's neck, kissing and biting and sucking in utter infatuation, utter starvation.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was pliable, so bendable in that state of complete reverence. Her breaths were frequently ragged and gasping, her little whines and whimpers only tossing more gasoline that was the burning fire Rio was, encouraging her on, giving her the feeling like she could have done it forever and never have gotten tired of it.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been so focused on her own actions that she had not noticed Agatha's hands on her back, or the way her nails had started raking deep lines across her skin. At least, not until she felt the sting. Somehow, it only drove her on, propelling her forward at breakneck speeds.
    </p>
<p>
     Her left arm pulled up, hiking up Agatha's leg a bit higher as she used the opportunity the movement afforded her to press two of her fingers into Agatha's core.
    </p>
<p>
     If she would have timed it? The absolute roar of a moan that tore from Agatha's lungs lasted approximately between eight and twelve seconds, give or take.
    </p>
<p>
     It pulled Rio in, the weight of her body sinking into Agatha's, their flesh slick with sweat in all of the places it touched. She was a storm of teeth and lips and hot breaths on skin as she worked as precisely as she could at reaching every last inch she could get to. She was not rough by any measure, but Rio was most assuredly desperate in every way imaginable.
    </p>
<p>
     She kept her movements fluid and steady, but as she seemed to flick her fingers just the right way, she could sense it before it happened.
    </p>
<p>
     All at once, Agatha's nails sank deeply into the flesh covering Rio's shoulder blades, and a sound so wild and bright filled the entire room. Rio was incredibly shocked when the glass behind her did not immediately shatter at the noise, but she was impressed none the less.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Damn, Agatha had pipes.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was not even Rio who was keeping Agatha's knee pinned to her side at that point; Agatha was squeezing it there, trembling on her one steady leg in a way that both satisfied Rio and also made her realize that she should probably get her off of her feet. She released her grasp on her thigh and noted as she glanced down that it, too, was trembling wildly.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Gods be damned, when Agatha came, she really made a fucking show of it.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio gently separated their bodies, but only for a moment so that she could pull Agatha beneath her arm, ushering her with unsteady footsteps over to the couch.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Lay down,"
     </i>
     she instructed softly, all but pouring Agatha onto the plush cushions. She stood back to full height and strode across the office for the mini-fridge she had once seen Agatha get into for her tea, secured behind a cabinet door. She pushed on the corner and with a soft
     <i>
      click
     </i>
     it popped open to reveal the pint-sized refrigerator.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled two bottles of water out and kicked both doors shut before she made her way back to the couch.  She handed one of the bottles over to Agatha, who took it with a wordless -- and exhausted -- look of thanks.
    </p>
<p>
     Looking down at her, her skin so flush with the effort of their fun, Rio would have sworn that she was
     <i>
      actually
     </i>
     glowing.
    </p>
<p>
     A warm smile filled her face and she placed herself on the edge of the seat, the arch of her ass pressing flat to the side of Agatha's hip as she tried to down as much water as she thought she could stomach. Rio's eyes lifted across the window and she almost spit out her water at what she saw.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a very clear impression of a body that had been left in sweat and had dried in a cloud of a silhouette.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I bet your cleaners are going to have a field day in here,"
     </i>
     Rio mused lowly, dark and amused eyes sweeping over to Agatha, who still seemed to be attempting to locate the pieces of her brain she needed to make it work.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tucked the back of her hand under her chin, resting on it as she tilted her head in adoration at the woman before her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Listen, if I fucked you stupid, you absolutely cannot hold me accountable if your career tanks,"
     </i>
     she mused, and that drew a response.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips curled in a blithe smile, sparkles of light shimmering so affectionately in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Actually,"
     </i>
     Agatha managed, finding her voice despite how unsteady it still sounded.
     <i>
      "If there's a yearly and/or lifetime subscription to whatever the fuck that was, I would like to invest everything I own in it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio dissolved into giggles, rolling her eyes as she leaned forward to set her bottle down. She leaned back and shifted around so that she could lay on her side, pressed right into every curve and crevice she could find beneath Agatha's arm.
    </p>
<p>
     They laid like that, quiet in their veneration, for a little while. Agatha's fingers traced light shaped over Rio's back, much in the same way that Rio was intently focused on the lines she drew up and down Agatha's stomach. It was a moment of peace, of feeling like the idea of utopia could be real, and it could be found right there in that office.
    </p>
<p>
     The air had grown so still around them, but a sudden burst of giggles that tumbled out of Agatha nearly scared the shit out of Rio. She lifted her head, eyes sweeping down into that gorgeous face in curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Do you know what I just realized?"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed, her eyes tracing lines over Rio's face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head in encouragement.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I have no idea what you do for work."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Rio fell prey to the trembling of humor, too, dropping her head to press her face into Agatha's shoulders, their bodies shaking in a symphony of laughter. She lifted her face, resting her chin on Agatha's shoulder, finding herself in that familiar position of just... beholding the other woman.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I program robot bees,"
     </i>
     she breathed in response, though the moment her grin touched her face, she could see it reflected on Agatha's, too.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Really?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Well, I mean. They're pollinating drones. They're about the size of a bean. By the time I complete all coding and algorithms, each one will carry four years worth of computer coding inside of it."
     </i>
     She stopped herself, her smile turning a little sheepish.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Estee tells me I am a 'fuckin nerd.'"
     </i>
     The softest chuckle passed through her lips, but the look on Agatha's face was... actually interested?
    </p>
<p>
     The hand that had been on Rio's back raised to her shoulder, pulling her a little closer into Agatha's chest as Rio laid her head back down.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What you are, Rio Vidal, is a goddess."
     </i>

<p>
     As lids slid open, a soft gasp passed through Rio's lips as she was throttled into consciousness by a restlessness that only seemed to come from nightmares. She could feel it in the tips of her fingers and toes, like it had been one of those illusions of falling and waking up mid-air.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, the world around her began to bleed in; the room was mostly dark, but there was one dim lamp still on in the corner, casting the faintest glow on the ceiling. She inhaled; lavender and vanilla and the slightest tickling of her nose by the few strands of hair her breath had picked up. Agatha was warm against her, Rio's own arm draped over her middle. Her head turned slightly, nuzzling into the comfort she felt in those first few moments of consciousness.
    </p>
<p>
     And then it hit her.
    </p>
<p>
     She lifted her head, processing more of where they actually were, her eyes immediately finding the back of that white couch. Shit. They had fallen asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't like anyone could have blamed them. What had unfolded in that office that night? Rio had read
     <i>
      books
     </i>
     and that was something she didn't think anyone could pen into existence.
    </p>
<p>
     Then again, was any of the last five days?
    </p>
<p>
     Five days. Had it really only been five days? The revelation seemed to pounce on her in the dark, stilling her breath for just a moment. Everything they had done; the hotel bar, dinner and a beach fire, a literal fucking
     <i>
      horseback ride,
     </i>
     going home with Agatha, making Nicky's unfortunate acquaintance, and then what had happened in that office?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      How had it only been five days?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     After a brief moment of reflection, she realized that it was probably a good idea to wake Agatha so they could sneak their way out before the sun came up and people started showing up to work.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted her head off of Agatha's shoulder and leaned toward her sweet, serene, sleeping face. Her lips pressed ever-so-softly to the apple of her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha,"
     </i>
     she breathed against the warmth of her skin. Her fingers pressed tenderly into Agatha's side, a gentle prodding that she hoped might rouse her.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft snore, and a gentle stirring as Agatha's arm moved, her hand landing just below Rio's elbow. She could have imagined it, because Agatha was still clearly asleep, but she felt her gentle grip flex into the flesh of her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tugged on her side a little harder this time.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Baby, wake up."
     </i>
     As it tumbled out? The way it hit her own ears caused her chest to squeeze. It was a term of endearment that Rio was using for the very first time in this context, in the context of a relationship, and it struck her how easy it had been to will it into the universe.
    </p>
<p>
     That seemed to work. Agatha's body shifted a little and her head turned, forehead landing flush against Rio's lips inadvertently. She exhaled a low hum that Rio could feel in the depths of her being. She would have loved nothing more than to just curl back up into the warmth of Agatha's bare skin and sleep for a day, but they were in a very compromising position... literally.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "We fell asleep in the office,"
     </i>
     Rio murmured at her. The next words came with a sleepy ease that startled even her the moment she said them.
     <i>
      "We should go home."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In the following seven seconds, two things happened at roughly the same time: Rio could feel the absolute gravity of that last word as it had hit the air around them, and she could also hear the content sigh that indicated the lifting of Agatha's lips into a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel it, that mix of panic and thrill that sat heavy in the middle of her throat. She knew that Agatha was likely still groggy enough that she hadn't actually caught the weight of it, or how it was suddenly making Rio batten down the hatches against her own internal monologue. It wasn't
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     home. It was Agatha's. Where her son was likely still ruminating in that pool house, angry at Rio's sudden presence in his life.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had checked into Hotel Harkness, but she was merely a guest. She had a home, a daughter, a life that would undoubtedly still be waiting for her by the time she found the courage to peel herself from the depths of the fantasy she was now living in. She would go back to waking up to waves instead of skin, to watering her plants instead of the blossoming bud that was beginning to flower between them.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a silver lining that she could dwell on later; Agatha had signed those permits that first time they had gone to the office. She would be back. When that would be was still to be determined.
    </p>
<p>
     Another soft hum came from Agatha, this time in something that slid into a groan. The hand that had been holding Rio to her began to move, a sign that she was rousing a bit more.
    </p>
<p>
     With the way it was literally right there, her lips already brushing it due to the way they were laying, Rio puckered her lips a little, placing an intentional kiss to Agatha's forehead. She gave another light, playful prod to Agatha's side.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "C'mon. We can get back and pour ourselves into your overly large bed that we will only take up the middle of when we tangle up."
     </i>
     Rio's voice was soft, but it was tempting in its rich delivery.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
<i>
       Agatha let out a soft whine, huffing another soft puff of air through her nose, clearly conceding.
      </i>
</i>
</p>
<p>
     Begrudgingly, Rio somehow found a way to sheer herself off of Agatha's side, a sharp sense of immediate longing striking her in the middle at the way she was instantly so cold. She hadn't realized just how much body heat the two of them together had been producing.
    </p>
<p>
     She sat up, her feet landing gently on that lusciously soft carpet. A hand raised, first to wipe at her eye, and then she sild a sobering hand over her entire face, trying to force the sleep the rest of the way out.
    </p>
<p>
     She arched her back as her arms raised over her head in a stretch that pulled at every thread of every muscle she was using. She snapped forward out of it, though, when she felt a dusting of a touch running down her spine, a chill shooting straight through it. She had known it was Agatha the moment she felt it, but the way that single touched manhandled every bit of her cognitive function? It was a little disorienting.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
<i>
       She giggled softly, tucking her face into her shoulder as she sharply took in the other woman, though she was hiding her smile with the way her lips were pressed to her own skin.
      </i>
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "We are supposed to be leaving,"
     </i>
     Rio reminded her, as if in warning. Despite the fact that she still felt completely spent, she would have not thought twice about a round two. The general air around the room, though, was that sleep seemed paramount, above all else.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat up behind her, in a way that left her torso perpendicular to Rio's back and she didn't seem to be able to wrestle down her need for physical contact.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sensed her movement, her eyes sliding shut in mild anticipation, and her lips eased into a serene smile as she felt it; the touch of Agatha's lips on her shoulder, on her neck, on her other shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Okay, but seriously,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed, licking her lips, though her tone was curiously heavy.
     <i>
      "You really have to tell me how you
      <b>
       do
      </b>
      that."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could feel Agatha's chuckle against her skin, those goosebumps flaring up again. Agatha moved again, carefully finding a way to place herself behind Rio so that her front was flush to Rio's back, and Rio's backside was nestled between her legs, her thighs running the length of Rio's. Her warm embrace was immediate and strong against Rio's middle and she placed her chin on the first shoulder she kissed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "When I had my fall-out with Catholicism, I did a lot of research on cosmic theology as well as some into other well established religions. What I liked about cosmic theology was that it's a corkboard for the unexplainable, not limited to past-lives and reincarnation."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had tilted her head to rest against Agatha's. She was listening, hard, because she felt like this was one of those moments where Agatha was fully aware just how much her words mattered.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So, to throw it at the wall of the theories we have come up with that explain this so far? Doesn't seem so far-off."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it, that familiar ebb and flow of affection, pushing from Agatha, into her, and pulling back more than it had rolled in with.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You think we met in another life?"
     </i>
     Rio asked, the astonishment at the idea clear in the softness of her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was quiet for a few long moments and Rio could almost hear the search for the perfect words going on inside of that head. Subtly, her grip around Rio's middle tightened.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't know. I know it seems stupid, but... Even with you right next to me, I often can't get that sight out of my head, that view from up on that bridge, looking down on you. Your little shorts that I'm almost willing to bet you would not wear out, that soft green tank top, your sunglasses."
     </i>
     Agatha paused and Rio turned her face toward her a little bit.
     <i>
      "You whistled at me, I looked up, and for a moment, it felt like... Gods, I don't know how to say it without sounding idiotic or entirely insane."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's hand landed on Agatha's elbow on the opposite side, brushing softly at her skin in her show of support, as if to tell her that she wasn't going anywhere, no matter what she said.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I saw you and it felt like seeing someone I'd known my whole life and yet had not spent a minute of time with. I saw you, and I felt a familiarity I have never known. And then... next thing I knew, you were holding your hand out, lifting me out of that water."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The lightest sound -- a chuckle -- passed through Agatha's lips in just a breath.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "That entire night, I had so much fun. It was so impossibly nice to just... be no one to the rest of the world for a night. You... you have this way about you. Honestly? I'm still trying to figure it out. Despite the things you've gone through in life, you move with certainty and ease. Your trauma never made you second guess your place in the world, you knew that your duty and purpose was to be an amazing mother to Estee. That much was clear that first night."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Although physically she was finding a way to somehow not let it show, Rio was completely crumbling at listening to the way Agatha was talking about her. It caused a stinging at the backs of her eyes, but she took in a slow breath to try and steady the pooling of emotion that was gathering in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "When I went inside to shower, I definitely scoped you out, but not for the reasons you think. I... saw all of the plants, wanted to look at them. I just... followed them. When I looked up, I could see into what I now realize is Estee's room. I mean, I realized it when you told me you had a kid, but at the time, I was interested. I accidentally passed your room when I went to get clothes to wear and ended up in the den."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hm,"
     </i>
     Rio mused.
     <i>
      "That was why you held your hand out to me... for the first time," Rio tacked on, the smile audible in the thickness of her words.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "After I got out of the shower, I saw the post-its and the pen. I don't know why I did it, or why that was why I wrote, as if it would mean anything, but --"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She was cut off at the way Rio's grip tightened on her arm, a willing for her to stop.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It meant everything."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's face tucked into the crook of Rio's neck as she squeezed her a little tighter, held her just a little closer, though they were already practically bleeding into one another, the lines blurring between where Rio ended and Agatha began.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Estee helped me out with that, too, turns out. She found it on the floor and stuck it in one of my more prized plants, knowing I would see it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Another flitter of a laugh rolled in over the skin of Rio's neck, a shiver coursing through her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I owe her a drink, or something. 'Cause Jesus, what a wing-woman,"
     </i>
     Agatha responded, the curve of her smile still pressed to Rio's skin. She pulled back, though, hooking her chin back where it had been.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was quiet for a moment, but Rio could feel it, the slight tension creeping into Agatha as she sat there behind her. Rio raised a hand, the backs of her knuckles caressing Agatha's far cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Her jaw set as Rio perceived she had been biting her lip, but Rio made no move, did not prod or push. It was clear there was something building up inside of Agatha, something she was working on articulating, so Rio let her have her time.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Last night, when I went to go talk to Nicky... It was reasonable at first. I explained to him, in the most bare bones way, how I felt about you, and that you were not to be lumped into the experiences of my past. And honestly? It had seemed to pacify him, until he had asked how we met."
     </i>
     Agatha sighed softly, her lips worrying together for a moment.
     <i>
      "The more I tried to explain it, the less he wanted to hear it. He is under the impression that you could very well be an international serial killer and/or gold digger, to which I reminded him I am not
      <b>
       that
      </b>
      old. "
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Even though the humored smile wanted to find Rio's features, it didn't quite make it there; the moment was too heavy for that.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I understand as much as I can, as the person who put that trauma on him. I know that what I put him through wasn't fair, but it's also why I've let him strike his own path. Sure, he comes back every so often, like for birthdays and some holidays, but I was just so... so fucking happy to realize he had come home, only for him to act like that."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's thumb had picked up a pace of brushing at Agatha's arm, just leaving her to focus entirely on what she was being told.
    </p>
<p>
     Another sigh, longer this time, pushed from Agatha's nostrils.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "When I told him that you were someone I could really see spending the rest of my life with, it set him all the way off."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There was the slightest uptick of Rio's heartbeat, there steady in her chest. She knew Agatha had said it, because of the way Nicky had hurled it at her like it were a Molotov cocktail, but hearing Agatha say it in that moment?
    </p>
<p>
     The tears were falling before Rio could even feel them behind her eyes. She was quiet and still, though, not wanting Agatha to stop if there was still more she had to say.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "He looked me dead in the face and asked if I had finally caved to doing hard drugs, and he meant it. He... he called it lust, infatuation. He told me that I couldn't be so reckless because I wanted my life to
      <b>
       be
      </b>
      a movie instead of one I'm orchestrating, that I was putting everything I had, my career, my relationship with him, at risk to see this out. It... hurt. Which was the point I believe you might have been privy to."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was still crying, but now it had shifted to an empathy for this woman she cared for so desperately, this woman she had fallen in love with in a matter of days.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm not worried about my career, and as far as he goes, he hasn't left, so I think it's safe to say it's probably still salvageable. And if he does, the security system will let me know and I'll call him and we'll probably spend twenty minutes yelling at each other until he gets mad enough to shut up and listen."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Despite her silent tears, Rio did release a soft breath of a laugh at this. In the next, though, she remembered something. The thought caused her to stiffen slightly in Agatha's arms, which drew her curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I... I couldn't sleep last night. So I went to the kitchen for a glass of water and he was in there getting something to eat. I ignored him and got my water, but as I was leaving, he saw me and he just... I don't care if he hates me. He doesn't know me. His opinion of me, at this point, does not really matter to me because I am just a no one."
     </i>
     At this statement, Agatha's arms noticeably tightened around her waist, as if to assert her defiance to the acknowledgment of that fact.
     <i>
      "But... it really wounded me to hear him speak to you like that. So, I just told him that yes, he and I don't know each other, but that you love him. And that you're actually trying to be someone he can be proud of, which in my own opinion, you already are. He just doesn't see it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted her chin from Rio's shoulder, but immediately, her lips were pressed to the side of her head, that grip tightening even more. She could feel it, even before Agatha breathed it into her hair.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio moved, slowly as to give Agatha enough time to retract just slightly as she turned, their gazes meeting over her shoulder. She tipped her chin, catching Agatha's lips in a kiss that only seemed to megaphone her response.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you, too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     With another kiss, Agatha gave her one final squeeze, declaring that it was probably getting close enough to when people would show up that they should make a quick exit.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you happen to have a secret way out?" Rio asked, pulling her shirt over her head as her own eyes cast down, indicating the sex-stained blouse of Agatha's -- that was also buttonless -- where it laid on the ground. She lifted her eyes, taking in the sight of the other woman.
    </p>
<p>
     Her slacks were back on, and her chest was back to being hugged by that lavender lace. The tone in her muscles was visible with the way her hands were raised and she was pulling her hair into a ponytail toward the back of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alas, I do not. However..." she offered, pacing over to the cabinets that lined the wall behind her desk, reaching up to press on a longer panel. It clicked open to reveal a couple of shirts hanging and a few pairs of shoes on the bottom. She reached in and plucked one of the hangers out, sliding the shirt off of it before she placed it back in its home. "Shirts, I always keep. Though, I've thoroughly learned my lesson and will be bringing underwear with me to keep in there too," she added, a flirty raise of a brow cast in Rio's direction, only made better by that smirk she wore as she pulled the shirt over her head.
    </p>
<p>
     They gathered the rest of their things and departed into the dark of the building, quiet as they waited for the elevator to reach the bottom floor, Rio nearly falling asleep in Agatha's hold on the way down.
    </p>
<p>
     She had, actually, ended up dozing for a moment or two once or twice on the way back to Agatha's. She was only aware because the second time, she stirred to Agatha's lips on her forehead, beguiling her to wake up long enough that they could get inside and get into bed. She agreed, somehow forcing cognition into herself enough to climb out of the car and make it in the house. Their fingers were laced as Agatha pulled her into the house.
    </p>
<p>
     The lights were off, but there was the bright glow on the kitchen counter that was obstructed by a silhouette, and Rio's stomach began to seep into her toes, sinking at the sight of Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hold on her hand tightened and she pulled her toward the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
     "Goodnight, Nicholas. I love you."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's words were firm, assertive, but they also left no opening for a conversation as the pair ascended the steps, quietly tucking into the sanctuary that was Agatha's bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     They had been impossibly fast in the shower they took to remove the dried sheen of sex on their skin, and as Rio made her way into the bedroom, wrapped loosely in one of Agatha's robes, she couldn't help the warm blossoming of pink that licked at her cheeks when she took in the sight of Agatha looking at her like that.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What?"
     </i>
     she asked softly, almost shyly, as she shook her fingers through her hair one last time. She came around the edge of the bed and shifted down onto it, sliding over to press against Agatha's side. Her presence was immediately met with that protective and firm hold around her shoulders, pulling her in, into everything Agatha was and had ever been. And maybe, into everything she ever could be, too.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I just keep wondering at what point I'm going to wake up, tangled in sheets, alone, and realize that this has been nothing more than one really fucking long fever dream,"
     </i>
     she murmured, turning to nuzzle into the side of Rio's head.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand shifted over to land tentatively on Agatha's thigh, giving a gentle squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Even when you wake up in the sheets, alone, I'll only be a call away,"
     </i>
     Rio offered back, though the anguish in her tone was hard to hide as she said it. It was still at least over a week away until she had to think about going home, but she felt like they needed to be reminded of the inevitability, to keep them in check.
    </p>
<p>
     Keep them in check? Yeah right. Like that was ever going to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had spent more than twenty years alone, twenty years with the company of her own existence. Twenty years that she could say with certainty that she was happy.
    </p>
<p>
     In a grand total of six days, she was having to examine what the scope of her life was going to take in, and how she was going to move about a world that was suddenly so much bigger than the little island she had spent almost her whole life on.
    </p>
<p>
     In six days, she had fallen so deeply in love that she had absolutely no idea what she would do if she lost it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I guess that means I'll have to hold onto waking up in your skin for as long as I can,"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured, placing another soft kiss to the side of Rio's head. Her hold slackened the slightest bit on Rio's shoulders, and she sank back into the pillows, leading Rio to follow suit.
    </p>
<p>
     She slid down and curled into Agatha's side -- her spot -- an arm fastening itself across Agatha's middle, the steady drumming of her heart beneath Rio's ear.
    </p>
<p>
     And within minutes, they were both asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio stirred the next morning, she was not wrapped up in Agatha's arms, but her presence was still felt by the way their legs were tangled together. Gauging by the way it felt, and without turning around, it was likely Agatha had rolled to her other side at some point during the morning.
    </p>
<p>
     She lifted her phone to check the time and saw that she had a text from Estee asking if she would be able to FaceTime in a bit. Rio had shot her a text back to let her know she had just woken up, but that she would call her as soon as she got up and moving.
    </p>
<p>
     So, she had set about the routine she had started to build, brushing her teeth, combing through her hair. She changed out of the robe and into an old camp shirt and a pair of joggers, giving herself a once over in the full length mirror by Agatha's dresser.
    </p>
<p>
     She was timid in her journey downstairs, but was relieved both to see that Nicky wasn't inside and that he had also left behind half a pot of coffee that was still on the warmer. She poured herself a cup and decided to sit out back in the warmth of the afternoon California sun to call Estee.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama!" that sweet voice rang the moment her sweet face filled the screen. "I miss you!"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's grin was instant, as it was any time this happened. Well, almost.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi, roo. I miss you too. You doing alright?" she posed, glancing away to take a sip of her coffee before she re-focused.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am, mama. Tay just got back from Melbourne, so we have been just watching movies and ordering take out after class."
    </p>
<p>
     Taylah was Estee's best friend, and had been since they were in primary school. They graduated top of their class together, went to the same college, and even got an apartment together. That child might as well have been Rio's second, honestly.
    </p>
<p>
     "And I suppose you have filled Tay in on why I'm out of the country?" Rio posed, quirking a brow in amused curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Estee could speak, Taylah's head of blonde hair poked into frame.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think she's lying to me, Mama Vidal. Is she lying to me?" Tay asked, her own brows arched high in interrogation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed, shaking her head. "She is not lying to you. I plan on staying for another week or so. But... I think it's safe to say that I will be planning future trips. I... already hate thinking about leaving."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze was so locked on her phone that she did not notice that the window to the pool house was opened more than half-way and the curtains were moving slightly, but not from a breeze.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's because you're in
     <i>
      love,
     </i>
     mama," Estee practically sang at her, to which she rolled her eyes, but still offered a laugh in mock consolation.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah? And is that a problem for you?" she asked back, her tone light and teasing.&lt;
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm actually
     <i>
      thrilled
     </i>
     for a chance to get you off my back," the joke came back over the phone, Rio's grin growing so wide that it wrinkled the corners of her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "And I think this is literally the cutest fucking thing I have ever heard, so good for you, Mama Vidal!" Taylah chimed in, the laugher only bubbling more from between Rio's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, Tay. I do have to say, I miss the fuck out of the both of you. We need to have a girls' day after graduation. Entirely my treat! Just my way to show the both of you how proud I am of everything you have each accomplished. You both just... Gods, I'm so lucky to have you in my life."
    </p>
<p>
     A soft echo of "Awwwww"s came from both of the girls, the smiles on their faces bright and genuine.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, any plans for the day?" Estee asked, the curiosity flickering in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not yet, but that's typically how the days begin. Plus, it's two in the afternoon, here. I'm guessing if Agatha had to go into work, I would already be aware."
    </p>
<p>
     Work.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Her office.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes cut back toward the phone, the sudden realization that she had been drifting causing an embarrassed heat to slip onto her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sorry, mija. Got distracted, but I'm here!"
    </p>
<p>
     Both girls rolled their eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama Vidal, I think you've got it bad."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned again, this time rolling her eyes at the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe I do. Only time will tell. You girls go watch your movies. Catch a wave for me if the tide's right, yeah?"
    </p>
<p>
     They both gave assertive nods, saluting to her, though they both broke out into giggles.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you girls."
    </p>
<p>
     "Te amo, mama."
    </p>
<p>
     "Te veo, mija."
    </p>
<p>
     As she hung up the phone, Rio reached for her coffee and took a long pull, feeling the warmth as it filled her from the inside, though the sun had its own heat. After another moment, she got to her feet and made her way back inside the house.
    </p>
<p>
     As the door shut behind her, she was oblivious that, across the patio the door to the pool house opened. Nicky placed himself in the frame of it, watching through the window as Rio's form disappeared up the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
     He'd heard every single word of that conversation.

       I've been called a dreamer, desperate for sleep.
       <br/>
       You have been that dream, the one I shut my eyes to keep.

</p>

<p>
     It hadn't been long, perhaps a little over an hour, after Rio had returned to the bedroom after her chat with Estee. The warmth in her chest at the sight of Agatha sound asleep in bed caused the softest smile to form on her lips. How was this her life? How was it that every morning for the last five days, she'd gotten to wake up in the presence of this woman?
    </p>
<p>
     What the hell was she going to do when she had to go home? What was she going to do when she wasn't surrounded by the scents of palo santo and lilac, or lavender and vanilla? What was she going to do when she didn't wake up to already smell breakfast cooking in the kitchen? How was she going to handle it that she was going to spend night after night climbing into an empty bed?
    </p>
<p>
     More importantly, how was she going to be able to live with herself when she wouldn't be able to look Agatha in those gorgeous blue eyes, feel her cheek under her palm, and tell her with bleeding earnesty that she loved her?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio seemed to catch herself spiraling, propped up against the headboard with that mug of coffee idling in between her palms. Her lips twisted a bit in frustration; she still had over a week. She could not spend the next eight or more days sitting around, thinking herself into a pit over every reason this might not work. She'd already known that it was impractical, that it was beyond any logical explanation, and yet, she'd jumped out of that plane, not really giving a single fuck to check if she had a parachute on her before she did.
    </p>
<p>
     The only way forward? Let herself experience it. She couldn't get hung up on the what-ifs, even if they were outright terrifying. She wanted to soak up each moment she got with this damn enigma of a woman. Every day she woke up thankful for the pieces of Agatha she had given over the day before, that thirst for more knowledge, for more understanding would leave her parched before too long into the day.
    </p>
<p>
     She had raised the mug to take a sip of the coffee at almost the same time Agatha rolled over in bed, and for a moment, she was still. And then, her hand began to move around, frantically patting at the bed, her fingers landing shy of Rio's thigh by about an inch.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned, setting the mug down on the nightstand and reached over, picking Agatha's hand up as it continued its exploration.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm right here, love," she breathed, raising Agatha's hand to lean forward so that she could place a soft kiss across the back of it. "I didn't go anywhere. Well, aside from outside to call Estee."
    </p>
<p>
     A sleepy hum reverberated off of Agatha's own teeth. She gave a tug on Rio's hand, as if she wanted her closer.
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately, Rio obliged, sliding down to lay on her side in front of Agatha, her hand falling in its place on Agatha's side.
    </p>
<p>
     "How is she?" Agatha mumbled softly, as if she were in an active battle to keep the sleep from pulling her under again.
    </p>
<p>
     "She's good. Her best friend was visiting her family in Melbourne and she got back I think yesterday. Or -- today? Er... The time change really fucks with my head," she disclosed, breathing a light laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "Tay is like my adopted child, one of those that your own picks up along the way, you know," Rio told her; she knew she didn't have to say it outright to imply that if ever there were to come a day that she got to meet Estee? Well, she would probably meet Tay, too.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mmmm," Agatha hummed, a gentle smile tugging on her lips. She looked so peaceful, so...
     <i>
      carefree.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "I take it you don't have to work today?" Rio cooed at her, craning her neck far enough forward that she could press a soft kiss to the tip of Agatha's nose.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can work from home today," Agatha prattled back, though her tone was still a little gravelly with her drowsiness.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached up, running a fingertip down the length of Agatha's nose, her eyes dancing with light as she watched her own movements.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you still tired?" Rio posed, trying as hard as she could to make it sound as though her tone was curious, but there was an edge of taunting just around the outside of them.
    </p>
<p>
     "You fucking wore me out, what do you mean? Of couse I'm still tired," Agatha responded, her brow pinching in mock offense. She wasn't actually upset, but she also wanted to provide a little push back for the fun of it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, so is this the part where we talk about that?" Rio asked, a smirk springing to her features as a brow cocked in question.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes finally opened, looking right into Rio's with the piercing accuracy of a well thrown javellin. Her expression held a form of neutrality for a moment, and then there was an air of self-satisfied pride that washed over her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Which part? The one where you're a real good listener, or the one where we learned new things about our bodies?" she drawled slowly, her gaze steady in its carress of each and every one of Rio's features as she took her in, really beheld her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Listen,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed, that flush of embarrassment dropping on her like an anvil. "I had literally no idea that that was even a
     <i>
      thing.
     </i>
     But..." her lips pressed together, her own eyes darting back and forth between each of Agatha's. "You looked like you'd just won the biggest lottery in the world, so I couldn't even get upset or embarrassed."
    </p>
<p>
     "I
     <i>
      did
     </i>
     win the lottery," Agatha countered, her voice verging on daring. "But it was long before
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     happened."
    </p>
<p>
     In an instant? Rio absolutely could have just disappeared, just melted into the warmth of Agatha's stare. She knew what she was saying, without saying it. It was a common sentiment between them at this point.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's palm raised and nestled lovingly against Agatha's cheek as she leaned forward enough to press their lips together in a smooth and full kiss, a welcome to the day she was hoping they would have.
    </p>
<p>
     Things with Agatha weren't ever set in stone, which Rio thought to be rather ironic. Agatha seemed the type who would need to keep a tight schedule, but she was just so... There it was, that word again. She was so damn carefree.
    </p>
<p>
     Hadn't Agatha told her, that very first day?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I guess I'm just used to the world moving around me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha went where she wanted, did what she wanted, anyone's opinions be damned. She didn't care about making other people feel validated, or like what they said had any weight in her life. Hell, she hadn't even taken it from her own son. Rio was not sure if that was a testament more to who Agatha was as a person, or if... Could it be that she had already grown
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     protective of Rio?
    </p>
<p>
     That was silly. Even Rio was well aware that in Agatha's world? Number one had been and would always be Nicky, and as a mother? Rio respected that, and would never dare consider the idea of trying to tread on that relationship. The issue Rio took was with the rebellion that was constantly seeming to spike at every given moment.
    </p>
<p>
     That conversation out back had replayed through her head more times than she cared to admit; the way she had picked it apart, tried to analyze it and understand it, even without twenty years of history or context, it just left Rio feeling sad. She knew that while she had done everything she could to do right by Estee, she had made her own fair share of shit decisions, but the difference was that Estee actually had a forgiving bone in her body.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, there had been that strangely charged air around them when she had gripped at Rio's hand so tightly as she bid goodnight to her son. She couldn't have put a name to it at that moment in time, but looking back on it now?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been protecting her.
    </p>
<p>
     The realization in the moment made Rio kiss her a little harder, just a push but nothing meant to entice. It was just a showing of true, pure affection. It was a way for her to understand that Rio simply felt like she could not get close enough. The reason Rio would kiss Agatha until her lungs no longer worked behind closed doors?
    </p>
<p>
     It was the same reason Agatha was insistent on holding her hand once they stepped out of them.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a constant reminder of the now, of the physical grounding of what it felt like to be in direct proximity to a human that burned brighter than the sun.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio pulled away, her eyes fluttered open to behold Agatha's adorable face, still half smashed into the pillow, though there was more awareness in her gaze, like that had certainly been a way to wake up.
    </p>
<p>
     In her first actual substantial movement for the day, Agatha raised a hand and used two fingers to tuck a few strands of Rio's hair behind her ear, just... watching her. Worshipping her with that gentle gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, I was thinking..." Agatha's voice came, soft and sweet as she chewed on the inside of her cheek in thought. "I do have some things I need to look over and approve at some point today. But... I remembered you telling me about the blue pools, which... I did visit, and also secured a permit for. So... thanks for that little bit of inspiration," she gushed in a praise that washed over Rio like a warm rain. "If you're up for a little hike, probably about the same duration, I'd like to take you to Escondido Falls. We can pack a lunch --"
    </p>
<p>
     "Dinner," Rio corrected, her grin instant.
    </p>
<p>
     "Shit... What time is it?" Agatha asked, lifting her head to glance toward the window. Rio noticced those deep red lines on her cheek, causing her stomach to give a little flip in adoration.
    </p>
<p>
     "A little after four."
    </p>
<p>
     She let out a low groan as she dropped her face directly into the pillow, letting if muffle the sound of her frustration. She lifted her head again, breathing a sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe hike tomorrow. How about..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Rio cut her off. "You do realize that we do not have to non-stop go and do things
     <i>
      all the time,
     </i>
     right?" she offered with a knowing tip of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm okay if you just want to stay in tonight, get your work done, and then maybe we can watch something, or sit outside."
    </p>
<p>
     There was this slight dimming in Agatha's eyes, and Rio almost backtracked, but then Agatha spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you sure?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scooped a gentle hold under Agatha's chin as she rolled up onto her elbow to get a better look at her. "Haven't you realized it yet?"
    </p>
<p>
     The question in Agatha's eyes was clear; she didn't know which part Rio was talking about.
    </p>
<p>
     "We could literally get stuck in your elevator, for hours, and I could practice self restraint and not put my hands on you. And you know what? I'd still have the time of my life."
    </p>
<p>
     That smile? That full, sweeping smile that literally touched every single piece of Agatha's expression? Rio might as well have been on the moon, because being on any plane of earthly existence? It was not going to happen when Agatha was looking at her like that, smiling at her like that.
    </p>
<p>
     "Really, though. Pull that laptop out and I'll be stuck to your side, book in hand and glasses on. Maybe you'll cook me something fancy if I'm lucky." The warmth of her tone was reminiscent of the end of a hot summer day as the sun just slipped over the horizon. It had its heat, but it was like a cloaking of softness and harmony.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pushed herself up onto her elbows so that their faces were a little more even in front of one another, those eyes doing that ever-so-familiar thing they did where they looked straight into her, picking apart the pieces until she found what she was looking for. Those thoughts bustled and blew behind those blue pools and Rio had almost reached a point of anticipation, waiting for Agatha to speak.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know it's a common topic... But... I just..."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's grin was tamed only slightly, but the sheer joy at watching Agatha fumble for words was completely lighting her up. Someone who was so well-spoken, so outspoken, so sure in everything she put forth into the world?
    </p>
<p>
     "It's okay. I know. You're thankful, because I am too. I think that the true test in a relationship is when you figure out if you still work when you sit in silence for hours tending to your own things," she offered, her features softening. "So, I suppose it's good we're hitting that hump now, hm?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand raised in a quick motion that Rio had not been expecting, and she had not been expecting the way Agatha's palm covered her entire face, her fingertips sliding over her scalp as she playfully pushed her away.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ack! That optimism again! You should really go get that checked out," Agatha released in a mix of a declaration and a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had started to open her mouth to say something back, but something caught her attention. It was... a smell? A good smell. It smelled like food, but she couldn't immediately identify what it was. Her brow wrinkled the slightest bit and she glanced back at Agatha, her curiosity also seeming piqued.
    </p>
<p>
     With pinched brows, the two of them climbed out of bed and offered gentle adjustments to hair and wardrobe to make sure that if they did venture downstairs and Nicky happened to be there, it might not encourage him to show his ass in its entirety. She was behind Agatha, fingers linked together as Agatha's arm reached out behind her for the contact.
    </p>
<p>
     As they reached the base of the stairs, they both stopped, a bit stunned by what they saw.
    </p>
<p>
     There were three plates stacked on the corner of the island with three sets of silverware laying next to them. A few inches away, there sat a bottle of red wine and three glasses.
    </p>
<p>
     On the other side of that island, Nicky's back was to them as he tended to something on the stove.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, breaking out of her nervous tension, realized that the smells had become more intense, and they smelled
     <i>
      really good.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "Hi, son," Agatha greeted, though there was a tense edge of nerves that wrapped snugly over both words.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky's head lifted, looking over his shoulder at the both of them for a brief moment before he turned his attention back to his work. Rio could feel as that protective flame flared up in her stomach, but then he spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, mom," he offered back, his tone far less tense than the last time Rio had heard it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you having company?" she asked curiously, clearly having taken notice to the dinner wear he had set out.
    </p>
<p>
     "No," he responded, and for a moment, Rio felt stupid. Obviously, he could not possibly mean what he was implying with such a vague answer.
    </p>
<p>
     "So you're cooking for...?" Agatha pressed on, clearly missing the cue that Rio had quickly picked up on, but would not dare to speak on.
    </p>
<p>
     "You guys," he answered, his tone so cool and calm like it was just something that made the most sense in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it, that obvious shift in Agatha's posture as it went through phases. First, her hand gripped at Rio's a little tighter. Then, she inhaled a sharp breath, tensing. Last, she exhaled it, her posture softening completely.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky..." she managed, obviously in an attempt to try and understand.
    </p>
<p>
     He still didn't turn, though, keeping himself busied by whatever it was that he was working on.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicholas."
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, he stilled his motions over the stove and turned around, his lowered gaze slowly raising to meet Agatha's over the space of the island.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm sorry, mom. And... I'm sorry to you, too Rio," he offered softly, his eyes sweeping over to her for a moment in acknowledgement.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio almost immediately realized that this was a rare moment; the way that Agatha was holding her breath, as if she thought that it was going to shatter right in front of them and he would instead reveal that it was some grand scheme to make her miserable.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I wasn't fair to you. And... I got angry because I really had thought things were different and I just..." He stopped, pressing his lips together in a very Agatha-like way as he tried to pull the right words out. "I reacted because I thought we were at a good place, that you were doing really well. And I just... When you told me, about Rio," he said, his eyes shifting over another moment, then cutting back to Agatha. "You're both right. I don't understand it. But... maybe that's because it's not my place to understand."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stole a glance at the woman beside her and she realized she was seeing another new facet of Agatha; the agonized mother who was actively trying to correct past mistakes, staring in the face of the injured son who was still healing.
    </p>
<p>
     His gaze drifted to Rio, watching her for a moment. In the light? His eyes looked so much like Estee's. She felt a pang of understanding in her chest, but when he spoke? It was Rio's turn to be shocked to her core.
    </p>
<p>
     "I heard you, earlier," he voiced, but he was quick to clarify. "On the phone with your daughter and her friend. And... I heard you guys talking about my mom. And I guess it made me realize that I judged you pretty harshly for not knowing anything about you. You had no idea I could hear you, and you just..."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel acutely every place where her knuckles collided inside of her hand as Agatha squeezed it so hard she actually had a brief moment of worry where thought something might break.
    </p>
<p>
     "You clearly love her. And... As much as I still don't get it... I've always wanted my mom to find someone who could love her for all that she is, mistakes and imperfections included. Because god knows, it's a really fucking hard job sometimes."
    </p>
<p>
     She could hear it, the huff that accompanied a tight smile on Agatha's lips. She understood it.
    </p>
<p>
     "But... if you meant what you told your daughter, then... that's good enough for me to give you the benefit of the doubt."
    </p>
<p>
     There was still this small, indignant part of Rio that wanted to be mad, that wanted to read deeper into what he was saying to try and dissect it and shred it down until its validity was no longer credible. With the way Agatha still had that death grip on her hand? She did what she could to squeeze back as she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did mean it. So... thank you."
    </p>
<p>
     She got it; he was being protective while also trying to deal with learned behaviors that his childhood had taught him. Agatha recognized that, in her eyes, she had not been a good mother when he was younger and while she knew she could not go back and do it over with a fresh understanding, she was actively trying to make her life better. Agatha only ever wanted to make Nicky proud; that much was painfully obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Agatha's hold began to slacken on Rio's hand until they were at a normal level of pressure when it came to the contact.
    </p>
<p>
     "What did you make?" Agatha asked softly, tipping her chin toward the stove.
    </p>
<p>
     "Spinach and artichoke stuffed chicken with scalloped potatoes and brown sugar glazed carrots. I just did what I could with what was already in there," he offered by means of explanation, as if every item he had not listed did not sound positively delicious. The thought also struck her -- Agatha had taught Nicky how to cook. It warmed something in her, something that was fighting to stay iced in regards to him.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes swept down to the bottle of wine, raising back up to his in silent question.
    </p>
<p>
     In the wordless exchange, Nicky's eyes followed her gaze, then lifted back up to her. The grin on his face was sheepish and he raised a hand to the back of his neck, giving a gentle shrug.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio did not know was that the bottle he had pulled from the wine cellar and placed on that island countertop was worth over a thousand dollars.
    </p>
<p>
     "The Rothschild? What's the occasion?"
    </p>
<p>
     The look that fell across Nick's expression? Even though she was undoubtedly still wary, for fair enough reasons, Rio softened at the sight. It was... tender. Sweet, even.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well... it's our first dinner together," he stated, as though it should have been the most obvious thing in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grip on Rio's hand relinquished entirely as she paced over to her son, her hand raising to ruffle his hair as she kissed him on the side of the head.
    </p>
<p>
     "You did good, kid."
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The three of them had sat at that massive dining table, Agatha perched in her throne with each of her loyal subjects at either hand, Rio and Nicky directly across from each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Admittedly, Rio had carried some tension with her into the interaction, but it quickly seemed to dissolve. Nicky was, honestly, a pretty charming young man. He had clearly inherited his sense of charisma and charm from his mother, and he knew how to hold conversation without making it feel awkward or forced.
    </p>
<p>
     She sat, rapt and often with her fingers entwined with Agatha's beneath the table, as he told stories about his time in Dubai, about the things he and his best friend did in the spirit of getting all they could out of the experience. Then, he started to talk about his app, which Rio was sure was meant to be an update for Agatha, but Rio had recognized the opportunity as her in.
    </p>
<p>
     For the next forty-five minutes, there was a fluid back and forth about differently scaled algorithms, processing systems, and coded syntaxes between them, and Agatha simply sat back in her throne and watched. She didn't try to interrupt or ask questions, she just let them talk, let them make points the other had not thought about it.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky, intrigued, had caved and asked how Rio knew so much about coding, because that knowledge was definitely not common. When she had provided her answer? Agatha's gaze was in a constant battle of who to focus on more in that moment. Nicky was floored; he had clearly not expected something of such magnitude, and Rio looked so goddamn smug that Agatha could hardly contain the swelling of feeling that took her over.
    </p>
<p>
     Between the three of them over the course of the two hours they had sat there, they had drained the entire bottle of wine.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did not have the foresight to make dessert, too," Nicky announced with a downturn of his lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well," Agatha posed, leaning forward to prop her chin on her palm, elbow planted on the table. "How about you take the car, I'll send you some money, and you can go to Atomic and get us some ice cream?"
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky's grin was easy and fast, his eyes lighting up. "Of course. Salted caramel and marshmallow for you, of course. And...?" he posed, his gaze shifting. It all happened in a split second; Rio knew what was coming and her gaze cut to Agatha, and Agatha's grip on her fingers tightened.
    </p>
<p>
     "The cherry jubilee. The one with the cherries and chocolate chips," Agatha told him, and the way she said it with such authority? Nicky seemed to believe it as if it were a fact they had shared in a previous conversation, but Rio's stomach was doing absolute somersaults in her middle. She was fighting for her life not to leap across that corner and pounce on that woman and pepper her with every kiss she could stand.
    </p>
<p>
     He stood and tapped his back pocket to verify his wallet was there before he headed out to meet the driver. "I'll be back soon, I love you!" he called, disappearing down the foyer to the front door.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Rio heard it click shut? Her head whipped back, wild and wondrous eyes taking Agatha in.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "How the fuck did you know that cherries and chocolate are my favorite?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's smirk was almost wicked, but she simply squeezed her hand in response.
    </p>
<p>
     "Like I said. When I look at you, it's like I've known you my whole life. I'm just enjoying the minutes we now get to spend together learning the things I can't already feel in my bones."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stared, completely dumbstruck by how positively enamored she was with the woman who looked across the space at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're a goddamned wonder, Agatha, you know that?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I've been told. But the way it sounds in your accent is my favorite."

       Speak easy to me.
       <br/>
       I've got a lot on my mind this time tonight.
      </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     The rest of the night seemed to have gone by in a flash.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had taken the opportunity Nicky's absence had afforded her to utilize the time to shower Agatha with affection, leaned over the corner of that table. She had kissed across her face, lips gracing cheek bones, forehead, nose. She had told her how beautiful she was, how intelligent, how vivacious and cunning. For each kiss, an acknowledgment of each part of Agatha that made her more and more attractive.
    </p>
<p>
     When he had come back, they had migrated to the couch and spent the evening watching The Challenge, which Rio found to be absolutely fascinating. The mastery of both physical challenges and the social politicking intrigued her. Nicky and Agatha would indicate their favorites and explain why, or, on the other end, explain why they couldn't stand certain players. When they had reached the episode that's elimination challenge was two men, harnessed with their backs together? Rio was practically on the edge of her seat.
    </p>
<p>
     The larger of the two men had somehow, in a feat of absolute incredulity, managed to get himself to his feet, the other man flailing and kicking in an attempt to find solid ground. He stood to full height, the man on his back like a little backpack, and marched his way across the proving ground to launch them into a metal barrel.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes had been wide as her head turned to take in Agatha, who was next to her, and Nicky, who was on the other side of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     As her eyes found them, her heart nearly stopped. They were both looking at her, that exact same shit-eating grin plastered to their faces. They had known this was coming; hell, it was probably the whole reason they started at some random season out of the forty that were available.
    </p>
<p>
     The chorus of laughter that bounced off of every surface in that home was almost heavenly. For as reserved and nervous as Rio had been when they had first taken him in when he was cooking, she was rather quickly finding a softness for the young man, now that he had decided to shed his spikes.
    </p>
<p>
     Just looking at the two of them... It was insane how similar they really were when side by side. Nicky's eyes were green, but almost in an aquatic shade that had so many of Agatha's flecks of blue in them. His hair was so curly and wild, so bleached by the sun in different places. He had the faintest kiss of freckles on the apples of his cheeks, surely a product of his childhood.
    </p>
<p>
     They had finished their ice cream and watched another few episodes before Agatha announced that she was getting tired and that the two of them were going to head up for bed. Nicky had nodded his understanding and said he was going to stay inside for a little bit longer before he tucked in too. Agatha had leaned over and placed another kiss to his temple before she told him that she loved him, and bid him a goodnight.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio and Agatha had scaled the stairs, hand in hand, both nearly melting the moment their feet crossed the threshold. Before they could reach the bed, Agatha gave a firm tug on Rio's hand, pulling her in for a strong and satiating hug that reached every part of Rio's soul. She could hear it, beneath her ear as Agatha tucked her head to her chest: The thundering pound of unyielding love.
    </p>
<p>
     When they had crawled into bed that night, Rio never could have imagined what the passing days would hold for her.
    </p>
<p>
     That weekend, Nicky had turned up with three tickets to Knotts Berry Farm. Rio, obviously, had no clue what that was, but when Agatha explained that it was an amusement park that used to be a berry farm year ago? Well, that sounded interesting.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd spent the day bouncing from ride to ride, just enjoying the little bit of thrill-seeking it had brought them. The laughter that had been shared had been plentiful and each second of it only seemed to pump Rio's chest full of something that had to be helium, with the way it made the heels of her feet lift, only her toes dragging as she floated her way around.
    </p>
<p>
     That day, with the three of them just doing the most trivial thing like riding roller coasters?
    </p>
<p>
     All Rio could think about was how she knew if Estee and Tay could have been there? It would have been an entire squad, and it probably would have fit perfectly. The more time she spent with Nicky, the more she could see that he and Estee would get on like a house on fire. They were both bright and driven, motivated in their own ways, and some deep pang of longing twitched in her at the hope that she might get to see such an interaction someday.
    </p>
<p>
     As their weekend had drawn to a close, Nicky had announced that he was headed back to his home base for a little while to try and push an update to the app as quickly as he could so that he could come home for another visit. He had been of the intent to simply take an Uber, but in a move that surprised Rio, Agatha had pulled a set of keys out of a bowl and held them up in question.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had nodded and allowed Agatha to drive the three of them to the airport -- in her goddamn Range Rover -- so that he could catch his flight. Rio, for the sake of being polite, had gotten out as well when they unloaded so that he could grab his things and depart. He had hugged Agatha long in hard, a soft conversation happening over shoulders that was not quite loud enough for Rio to hear.
    </p>
<p>
     As they parted and Agatha begrudgingly let him go, Rio had not been expecting his eyes to fall on her as she stood a foot or so behind Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     He stepped forward and tentatively held his arms out in question. A warm smile filled her face and she stepped forward to heed his request. It was a gentle hug, but it meant a lot, coming from him.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Take care of her while you're still here. When you have to go, we'll work together to figure it out."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     As that embrace ended, Rio, whose lips were pressed so tightly together that she was biting the insides, gave a curt not and turned back, climbing into the car.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of the door slamming shut gave her the permission she needed; she began to cry. She knew how he had felt the moment he had looked at her in that living room. She knew that he had been angry, upset, and scared, all for very valid reasons. But there he had stood, pulling her into an embrace and forming a plan of attack of how they were going to hold Agatha together when neither of them could be around to physically do it.
    </p>
<p>
     It moved her, in the way that she knew if the roles were reversed and it were Estee instead of Nicky, she would have been saying the same thing to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time she heard Agatha open the driver's side door, she reached up, furiously wiping at her face in an attempt to save some face.
    </p>
<p>
     When she looked up?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cheeks were wet, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Wordlessly, Rio reached across the console and picked Agatha's hand up, fastening her own around it snugly, so many unspoken things settling between them.
    </p>
<p>
     The ride home had been silent, and it was the heaviest silence that had fallen between them since Rio's arrival, and it remained that way throughout the following week.
    </p>
<p>
     The week had seemed to go by in a flash; they'd both had to invest quite a bit more time into the obligations of their careers, but it was done either side by side on that couch in Agatha's living room, or in Agatha's office posted in their designated positions.
    </p>
<p>
     The difference between the book and her laptop perched on her lap?
    </p>
<p>
     The laptop seemed to draw more focus from the far side of that desk. In a conversation that happened after the second day she had noticed it, Agatha had divulged that the expressions Rio often wore while in the throes of work were
     <i>
      incredibly
     </i>
     difficult to keep her eyes off of.
    </p>
<p>
     Their days, while filled with work, often led to nights of majesty and wonder. There were nights spent on the beach that was literally in Agatha's backyard. There were nights they sat atop that office building, watching the world move around them. There were nights when the brightest stars of the evening were the ones in Agatha's eyes every time she looked at Rio. There were nights when they would fall asleep and wake up to the warmth and dampness of skin and sweat. Every physical exchange seemed to only dial them in even deeper, beginning to entwine them in a way that was going to make separation impossible.
    </p>
<p>
     There was even a morning, three days before Rio was determined to go home, no matter how badly she did not want to, where she had woken up in an empty bed, much to her own chagrin. As she had lifted her head, though, she saw that there was a post-it note on Agatha's pillow. Her neat scrawl was across it with a simple instruction:
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Get something nice. The car will take you where you need to go. See you at 6.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Her eyes dropped, seeing that matte black credit card laying where the note had been.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, she had done as she was told. She got herself up, showered and dressed and made her way downstairs to rush a cup of coffee and head out. As she walked outside, though, her phone dinged in an announcement that she had received a message. She pulled her phone out to see it was from Agatha, an eyebrow arching in piqued curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Gio has the address for the store. I mean it, get whatever you like the most. And for the love of gods, do not look at price tags.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had gulped down the sudden push of affection that had nearly erupted from within her. Rio was not poor by any measure; her work over the last six years along had landed her with a salary that totaled in the high six digits, but she also was a tech developer, and not a critically acclaimed film director. Being told to treat herself on someone else's tab with no give or take was not something she was used to, ever, but she was learning very quickly that it felt... really good.
    </p>
<p>
     She had spent the afternoon pouring over different dresses, trying them on and sending Estee and Tay photos so that they could help her decide.
    </p>
<p>
     After about two hours, the three of them had come to a collective decision and she made the purchase, only after swiping the matching clutch on an whim. She checked the time; it was almost five. She grabbed the bag and made her way outside to see Gio standing at the back door, awaiting her return. She smiled at him kindly and he informed her he would return her to the house so that she could get ready, but that he was under strict instruction to have her in Santa Monica at 6pm sharp.
    </p>
<p>
     She had thanked him as she got out at the house and made her way inside to do as she had been charged. She took the time to do her makeup, the smoky eye and winged eyeliner suiting her appropriately. When she was done, she pulled the dress on and rummaged through Agatha's closet to find a pair of shoes, thankful that they wore the same size as she pulled the black velvet over her feet, securing the ties around her ankles.
    </p>
<p>
     She was ready and in the car by a little before 5:30, the anticipation slowly beginning to vibrate in her chest. What did Agatha have up her sleeve?
    </p>
<p>
     She watched the outside world in quiet reverence as the landscape would shift and change every so often. It had been a short while -- right at 6pm -- as they slowed at the curb and Rio's eyes lifted to see that they were in front of a building with the letters
     <i>
      Capo
     </i>
     printed neatly above the door. Even from the outside, Rio could tell... This wasn't just dinner. This was an experience.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes dropped, though, beneath the awning, her breath immediately escaping her.
    </p>
<p>
     There, in the most beautiful violet dress that hugged every single curve in just the right way, was Agatha, one lone rose secured snugly between her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes threatened to glass over, but she choked the emotion back. Taking a deep breath, she pulled the handle and pushed the door open. She slid to her feet, looking across the sidewalk to take in the sight of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes had started at Rio's feet, a small smirk forming at the sight of her own shoes, but then it traveled up.
    </p>
<p>
     It inspected every single way that black dress hung on Rio's frame perfectly, that high slit that almost reached her hip leaving just enough to keep Agatha wanting more. The cut was a deep v that ran from her shoulders to just below her navel, the empty space filled with an opaque black mesh. The way her hair was curled, and those earrings -- wait a minute.
    </p>
<p>
     Although she had been completely stuck on finding words, seeing those earrings made something in her balloon wide with heat, like she was going to be carried right off the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are those...
     <i>
      the
     </i>
     earrings?" Agatha asked, and though she was still nearly slack-jawed and in shock, Rio could hear the softness in the question.
    </p>
<p>
     An alluring smile curled her own lips as she nodded. Agatha crossed the space between them, her hand sliding into position on the small of Rio's back as she leaned in for a tender but full kiss that nearly yanked Rio under in its soft and unassuming demeanor. As she pulled away, Rio's smoldering green gaze found her at close range.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I took your shoes, too,"
     </i>
     she added, leaning up to steal another soft kiss that lasted but a couple of seconds.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had handed over the rose and they made their way, hand-in-hand, into the restaurant.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been right. It had absolutely been an experience.
    </p>
<p>
     The atmosphere had been dimmer, warmer, candles lighting up might of the space that wasn't  quite touched by the overheads. It really was incredible, and the food had somehow been even better. The conversation, as it always had, flowed easily and they had genuinely seemed to understand that there may never come a time when they couldn't just talk to one another.
    </p>
<p>
     They had departed after their meal and while Agatha had asked Rio if there was anything else she wanted to do, Rio's insistence that they get home had obviously landed exactly right with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The care and yet necessity with which they had completely stripped one another out of those dresses had been truly beautiful in the most soft ways. It was nearly a daily occurrence, to fall into the warmth of everything that was Agatha's nude body, but there was something about the impending weekend looming that pushed it to something else, to something that not only left them both trembling in the rippling waves of constant orgasms, but that had welded them together, permanently.
    </p>
<p>
     Physically, she would have to leave. Emotionally? She was branded into Agatha for the rest of time.
    </p>
<p>
     They had assumed their typical position in the sheets, tangled in every inch of one another, and it had not taken them long to fall asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     The ringing of her phone caused Rio to sit bolt upright in the dark, her chest tight as her eyes flew over to the phone; she could see both that it was 3am and that the person calling her was not her daughter.
    </p>
<p>
     In a confused panic, she swept up the phone and answered in a rush.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Tay?"
     </i>
     she questioned softly, as to not wake Agatha, but at the sound of crying on the other side? Rio's soul completely left her body.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Taylah, baby. What's wrong? What's going on?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mama, I... we -- it wasn't our fault -- she did everything right."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She wasn't making any sense, and it was only driving the stake of panic deeper into Rio's chest.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Baby, calm down. Where is Estee?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "They're t-taking her in for surgery now."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio literally could not breathe. Surgery? They were taking her in to be operated on? What the fuck had happened?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Tay. I need you to tell me right now what happened."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could hear the deep breath the girl pulled in, trying to steady herself and stop the tears from choking her up.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "We were coming back from the beach after crabbing. She was driving. We went through a light, she had the green, but a truck veered in front of us and hit us head on."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      Jesus fucking Christ.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Okay... Okay, so... first off,"
     </i>
     Rio managed, somehow building the strength she would need to finish this conversation.
     <i>
      "Are
      <b>
       you
       <b>
        okay?"
       </b>
</b>
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm fine, Mama Vidal. Just some cuts, and I might have broken my wrist, but I'm... I'm just worried about her. Her leg... Mama, it was bad..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio literally had no idea how she was still conscious when every single beat of her heart pumped the blood directly to her ears, nowhere else.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "How bad?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Tay began to cry harder.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Honey, are your parents coming?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yeah, they're heading to the airport now."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Me too. If she gets out and is awake before I get there, please make sure she knows I'm on my way. I love you, sweet girl. And tell her I love her, too. I will see you as soon as I can. I love you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you too, Mama."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In the same instant that Rio hung up the phone, she reached up and turned on the light, nearly flying out of bed to locate whatever clothing she could to throw on. She had her phone in one hand, frantically trying to book the soonest flight she could.
    </p>
<p>
     The light had caused Agatha to stir, but she had not moved or raised any question. In fact, she had not even opened her eyes until, in her panicked shuffling, Rio kicked the leg of the bed and let out a pained cry. She steadied herself, not looking at Agatha, and continued her frenzy of throwing what she could grab into her bag. She submitted the purchase for the ticket that would let her on a flight that left in three and a half hours and threw her phone on the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was completely stunned to silence, having no idea what the fuck she had just woken up to.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio?" her voice sounded, so soft.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't acknowledge her, just ripped through the room like a tornado in her terror. As Agatha blinked, getting a better look at Rio's face, she could see that she was absolutely distraught and there were rivers carving down her cheeks. In an instant, Agatha was up and moving across the bed, gently taking hold of Rio's hands as she looked up at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Something happened in that moment that had never happened before.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio yanked her hands away.
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately, Agatha's brow pinched together sharply and the look on her face was deeply wounded. What the fuck had happened?
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio," Agatha said again, though her tone was more hard, more demanding.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet again, Rio kept moving, her body trembling with her sobs. Agatha was on her feet, marching over to her before she reached out, forcefully pulling the other woman into her arms, hugging her to her bare chest.
    </p>
<p>
     The excruciating sob that filled the air around them? Agatha's heart completely busted in her chest. It was probably
     <i>
      the
     </i>
     most painful thing she had ever heard in her entire life. Her hand held tight to the back of Rio's head, trying to soothe her but being all too aware at the same time that it was not working.
    </p>
<p>
     The longer she cried, the more it helped Agatha understand.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "This is about Estee, isn't it?"
     </i>
     Agatha questioned in a pained whisper, her own eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was silent as she shook with her sobs for just another moment before she pulled back, her eyes finding Agatha's. They were filled with nothing but fear. Pure, unbridled terror that she might never get to see her little girl again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "She and Tay were in an accident. Tay's probably got a broken wrist but..."
     </i>
     she began to sob again, burying her face in Agatha's chest.
     <i>
      "Her leg is broken badly. They've taken her into surgery. I... I booked a flight. It leaves in three hours."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In that very second, it all came crashing down around them. This wasn't how things were supposed to be. Rio wasn't supposed to leave like this. She wasn't supposed to get on a plane worried sick about the one person she cared most about in the world. She wasn't supposed to leave until she was ready. She wasn't supposed to have to walk away from this until was absolutely necessary.
    </p>
<p>
     This was absolutely necessary.
    </p>
<p>
     In the blink of an eye, Agatha was thinking, building, trying to piece together a new plan, one that would benefit Rio more than commercial travel.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Finish packing. I'm going to make a call."
     </i>
     She placed a kiss to the top of Rio's head.
     <i>
      "I love you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sniffled and nodded, stepping away to do as she had been told. Agatha retrieved her phone and paced to the window, pulling it to her ear, though Rio could still hear her clearly as she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hey, Jack,"
     </i>
     she had breathed, knowing full well that it was past three in the morning.
     <i>
      "I know it's early, but I need a solid. Can you have the Hoatzin on the runway for me in less than two hours? I'll give you whatever you want, but I... It's really important."
     </i>
     She was quiet for a moment as the man formed his answer, which caused Agatha's posture to slacken.
     <i>
      "I seriously owe you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She disconnected the call and silently moved toward the closet to both change and also throw what she could into a duffel bag. She emerged only a moment later, the bag slung over her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Cancel your flight, love. We're taking a quicker route."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at her, clearly not understanding.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "There's going to be a jet on the tarmac for us in Ontario in less than two hours, courtesy of a friend."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes dropped to the bag on Agatha's shoulder, then raised back up to her in silent request for clarification.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're not going alone."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     More tears. This was not the way she wanted to bring Agatha back to the place she called her home.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dropped, kneeling before where she sat on the bed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's going to be alright. We're going to get you back to see her,"
     </i>
     she soothed.
     <i>
      "But I need you to realize that you don't have to do this by yourself."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio managed in a soft cry.
     <i>
      "I cannot expect you to just drop everything to do this."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Then don't. You don't have to expect it for me to do it. You love her, and I love you, so by extension, I kind of already love her, too. You need to be there with her, and you also need support. It's possible for you to have both at once, if you just let me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's wet eyes shook with terror the longer she looked at Agatha, but she finally managed to bring herself to deliver a nod. Agatha rose to her feet, though she leaned over so that her face was directly in front of Rio's, giving her a supportive kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Let's get going. Ontario's about an hour and fifteen from here."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stood, but before she took a step, she made a desperate grab for Agatha's arm, turning her back around so that Rio could surge forward, folding into her like she were a small child that needed to be comforted.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't know what I ever did to deserve this, to deserve you. But... thank you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha, blinking back tears, kissed at her head again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You loved me before you knew me. And now, I will love you until my brain and heart lose their fight to keep you there. I promise."
     </i>

</p>

<p>
     Although the audible crying had stopped by the time Agatha shut the door to the car behind her and Rio immediately tucked herself into her side as a result, the tears had never really stopped.
    </p>
<p>
     This was her fault. This happened because she had left, because she had put distance between herself and her daughter. She wasn't there to help, she wasn't there to protect. Rio's absence had allowed this to happen. She had been living in an absolute dreamscape for almost two weeks and she had forgotten that the universe? Well, it didn't really give one single, solitary fuck about her plans.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hands were trembling in her lap, fidgeting as she picked at her cuticles, not even wincing as she pulled a piece of skin large enough that it immediately caused her to start bleeding.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't notice. But Agatha did.
    </p>
<p>
     The hand that wasn't secured in a hold on Rio's shoulder lifted, covering both of Rio's hands lovingly, giving them a gentle squeeze. She could almost feel it, though, in Agatha's touch: the tentative worry that Rio might pull away again.
    </p>
<p>
     It hadn't been intentional, but it had since began to overwhelm her with guilt. Agatha had been... was there even a word for it? She could have said that she was amazing, but that downplayed her ability to dominate any problem someone put in front of her. She could have said that she was smart, but that would have undermined her sheer ability to simply think her way out of any given situation. She could have called her compassionate, utterly underselling just how much love she was truly capable of, but none of that seemed to fit, to feel right.
    </p>
<p>
     She sat there, her arm around Rio's shoulder being the literal bracing that was keeping her from completely falling apart. She was distraught, yes, and the truth was? In the dead silence of that car ride, she was taking every moment to completely kick her own ass, over and over and over again.
    </p>
<p>
     At about the forty minute mark, this had become painfully obvious to Agatha. She had been watching out of the window to try and keep any undue pressure off of Rio in the moment, but it was almost so loud she could hear it. It was a constant berating, a self-flagellation that she had somehow caused this, that she was somehow the reason this had happened. Agatha wanted to offer consolation, wanted to tell her that it likely would have still happened even if she had still been home, but she knew there was no sense in it. It wouldn't help.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head turned, looking at the top of Rio's head where it rested on her shoulder, those thoughts only seem to get louder as Rio seemed to shrink into her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio,"
     </i>
     Agatha's soft voice crooned in gentle request, but Rio didn't move. Agatha knew she wasn't asleep, not with the rate of her breathing and the occasional sniffle.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Baby."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There was another tremble of the smaller frame against her own and the tears were back to stinging at Agatha's eyes again. Still, though, Rio stayed tucked, her tears having completely soaked a couple inch patch of Agatha's sweatshirt. Agatha tightened her hold a little bit, dipping her head to place a soft kiss to the crown of Rio's head, though she did not lift the contact.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know it sounds like chliche bullshit... but it's going to be alright."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Rio suddenly sat up, her red and swollen eyes finding Agatha's in the dark of the car.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is it?" she shot back; a flicker of recognition flashed in Agatha's eyes as she watched, her teeth sinking into the inside of her bottom lip in anticipation for what she was about to get. That tone? That tone was one of sheer fright, of panic and worry. "I make the stupid and selfish choice to fuck off six thousand miles away, and I'm not there for my own child when she's literally in a room full of strangers who are cutting into her -- hurting her! And here I am, sat in this fucking car, not able to do a
     <i>
      damn
     </i>
     thing about it!"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was still, just watching her, an understanding expression melted gingerly onto those smooth features.
    </p>
<p>
     "And?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio balked for a moment, blinking, but then tore right back into her tirade. "And... And you just... You just make a phone call and summon a fucking jet, like that solves anything!" At this, Agatha battled valiantly to keep a twitch out of her lips. Rio was just yelling, now. She wasn't actually angry with Agatha, or the fact that she had used her connections to help her. In reality, it solved everything. They'd shave almost four hours off of the travel time, getting there in less than twelve. "You just have all the answers! You just take one look, and it's like you give no fuck about anything other than fixing it!"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head tilted to the side, her eyes so full of love that it confused Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why are you looking at me like that?!" she nearly shrieked, but Agatha's response was instant.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because I bet that's the first time since we got in the car that you stopped beating yourself up. And you did it by just shouting about things that don't actually make you mad or upset you."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha carefully lifted a hand, hesitating as her eyes softened in question. Rio didn't move, but she did swallow down the boulder in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     The moments Agatha's fingertips slid onto her cheek, Rio's eyes slid shut, pushing more tears down her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know it's still new, my love," she told her softly, though there was a sense of resolution that was tight over her words. "But soon, you're going to see it. You're going to realize that you're not alone."
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Until you leave, and I am again."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's face fell a little and she was thankful that Rio couldn't see it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "We'll tackle the semantics of that at a better time."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There was the softest whisper, the tiniest subtext in that line, one that Rio could never have understood the full volume of.
    </p>
<p>
     What Agatha was really saying?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      I'm going to find a way to be with you, come hell or high water.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's face crumpled again, though she had not opened her eyes. Agatha was rapid in her response, releasing the contact on Rio's cheek to instead pull her into her arms, wrapping her up in both as she nuzzled into her hair. For as strong as she had been holding, despite the stinging eyes and the few rogue tears, Agatha's resolve was beginning to crumble, one pebble at a time.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing Rio like this? Agatha had known pain in her life. She had lost loved ones, she had grown up in a home without love her entire childhood. But that acutely hollow ache that opened in her chest, that was a new feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it, the way Agatha was clinging to her, the way she was begging her to just fall into her, to just let her help her through this. None of this felt easy, because none of it was. It was never going to be a simple thing to see a loved one in pain, and even though she knew that Rio could throw it in her face that she didn't understand, she really did.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know it's easy to pin blame somewhere, to say that you leaving caused this. And I know that because for three years, I have worried every single day that if something happened to Nicky, it would be my fault for letting him go."
     </i>
     Agatha hesitated, turning her head so that her cheek laid flush against the crown of Rio's head.
     <i>
      "But... sometimes..."
     </i>
     Her fingertips ran lovingly through the ends of Rio's hair.
     <i>
      "It's sort of the way someone incredibly wise once put it to me. Sometimes, life is a lottery of meaningless tragedy. In the grand scheme, this doesnt actually
      <b>
       mean
      </b>
      anything, but because of where you are in your life, you're
      <b>
       giving
      </b>
      it meaning. Don't give it that power over you, my love."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That was the second time Agatha had used the sentiment, and Rio could feel it land and nestle in the deepest caverns of her heart. It was a flicker of warmth in the freezing cold.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "The important thing here is your reaction. You didn't even wake me up, you just hit the gas. You would have left me asleep in that bed without a second thought. And you're probably thinking that I would have been so pissed."
     </i>
     Her expression was so... gentle, so filled with every emotion she couldn't name. Agatha was talking to her like no one had ever cared enough to talk to her before.
     <i>
      "But... I know that the moment you had a chance to breathe, you would have called me before you got on the plane to tell me. And then I would have rushed out of bed, grabbed whatever I could, and prayed that if the gate was closed, I could somehow bribe someone to let me on to catch the flight with you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio shuddered again, a soundless choked sob. Hearing Agatha talk like that? Hearing her literally pour her heart out in the back of that towncar?
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio lifted her tear-stained face, biting roughly into her bottom lip.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You would have followed?"
     </i>
     Rio asked, the sound of her voice so impossibly small that it made Agatha's lips pull tight and down despite knowing that it was a valid question in regard to the duration of their relationship.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Don't you get it?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's brow wrinkled slightly, as if she truly did not understand what Agatha was trying to imply.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I would do anything in the world if it meant it could make your life easier. That's what love is, Rio. And the way I love you? It terrifies me every single day. It makes me feel insane. It makes me wonder if I'm really making the right choices."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's voice wavered with her emotion, the way she was truly put to the test when it came to letting go of enough to control to really reach in, crack her ribs open, and pluck that heart right out of her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Right there, she was handing it over to Rio, both with a sense of certainty and also void of fear.
    </p>
<p>
     And there they were, two astral forms, hovering above them; Agatha's hand was out and Rio saw it.
    </p>
<p>
     That astral hand hovered as Rio's eyes searced Agatha's in the dark, a silent willing for her to keep going.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "In twelve days, I haven't just fallen in love with you. I have fallen into you, and I have felt every single day, the deeper I sink, as if I could live in your skin. I'm not ready to climb back out yet. I'm not ready to go back to a version of myself that doesn't have you around."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Above them, in that plane that vibrated just out of sync with their own, those astral fingertips brushed over the beating offering in Agatha's palm. And then, with all the care in the world, it took hold and lifted.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I am so terrified... by how much I know I need you,"
     </i>
     Rio admitted, her bottom lip quivering at the admission.
     <i>
      "But I'm even more terrified of facing life without being able to hold your hand through it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand raised, so carefully cupping Rio's jaw, her thumb brushing tenderly beneath her eye.
    </p>
<p>
     And there it was.
    </p>
<p>
     That silent exchange, happening just a moment out of time, but happening none the less.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio understood it, the weight of what she now held.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "We're going to be okay,"
     </i>
     Agatha whispered to her softly, and the sincerity that was practically bleeding out of her? It was impossible for Rio not to believe. It had been harder before, in her hysterics, but in the quiet veneration of the back of the car? Something in Rio felt deep in her essence that Agatha wouldn't ever lie to her, not without good reason.
    </p>
<p>
     There weren't any words left, wasn't anything else left for her to try and articulate. They had pretty much all but bled themselves out on those leather seats and yet, somehow?
    </p>
<p>
     They had been good at being a couple, but now?
    </p>
<p>
     Now that they were embracing the magic?
    </p>
<p>
     It was the two of them, their own coven that housed power and potential, a true bonding through the power of emotion.
    </p>
<p>
     It had only been a couple of moments before the car turned off of the mainway and bumped down a long, desolate road that emptied out into a private airfield.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the fact that Rio wanted to see it for what it was, in every bit of its grandeur, she felt like the only reason she was able to keep walking was because Agatha was pulling her along. Hell, if she'd insisted she couldn't keep going, there was little doubt in her mind that Agatha would not have lifted her onto her back and carried her the rest of the way.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha led her onto the plane and told Rio to make herself comfortable while she spoke with the pilot. She had returned a moment later with the update that they had gotten clearance to land outside of Queenstown at another private airfield -- another favor Agatha was going to have to pay back to Jack tenfold.
    </p>
<p>
     The flight had been just over eleven hours, and Agatha was thankful for every hour of it that Rio slept, having thoroughly exhausted herself from the gauntlet of emotion she had been putting herself through. Agatha had decided to wake her about ten minutes before they landed so that she could get some kind of gauge as to where they needed to be going.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had checked her phone once they landed, seeing that she had a couple of messages from Tay, updating her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "She's out, but they have her sedated."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "They did another x-ray and there's a bone shard that hadn't been visible before they set her leg. They scheduled her for another surgery at 11am."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes swept to the top of her screen; it was almost 1:30pm.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could even process what it was she was doing, she was calling Taylah, finding it in her to stifle a sob when she answered, her voice so soft and sweet despite the trauma she was right in the middle of enduring.
    </p>
<p>
     "She's out," Tay told her, sniffling. "Nothing else major, but they did have to put a plate in. They literally just brought her back to her room. They told me that she'll probably be out for a couple more hours."
    </p>
<p>
     "We're here. We just landed about twenty minutes from Lakes District. The car is on it's way, so we should be there by about two. Have your parents gotten in?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, they were here but when I promised them I was okay, I sent them back to the apartment. If I manage to kill the devil's ivy Estee bought while she's stuck in the hospital, she'll never forgive me."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward, her torso folding completely over her thighs as she fought to keep the wail in her lungs contained. It wasn't that significant to anyone but Rio, and it had shot her right through the heart. She was still crumpled, but she felt Agatha's hand on her back.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could think to say anything, Tay spoke again.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm gonna go back in and sit with her, but I'll see you when you get here. I love you, Mama Vidal," Tay told Rio softly and the tears were pouring hot again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Tay?" Rio choked before the other girl could hang up.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know the right words to tell you how thankful I am for you, or how much I love you. But when I find them... you'll be the first to know."
    </p>
<p>
     "Get here soon, Mama."
    </p>
<p>
     "On my way, baby."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lowered the phone, her arm hanging defeated at her side. Agatha's hand was still smoothing out the worry, the pain, the anxiety on her back. Slowly, she unfolded herself, sitting back in the chair as she looked over at Agatha, completely helpless.
    </p>
<p>
     "Car just got here," Agatha offered in consolation, though she knew that had been a hard conversation to have. But now? Now, they were only twenty minutes from Rio getting to hold her daughter's hand, to tell her she was there and really mean it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha got to her feet and even though Rio had been staring straight ahead, she saw it, that lifeline being offered to her when she needed it most; Agatha's hand was waiting for her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze swept up to her face and what she saw both somehow shattered and mended her heart at the same time. The softest light shone in her eyes, beautiful blues that were glassed with emotion. The corners of her lips were lifted, ever-so-slightly, in a hopeful manner. When she looked into that face?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio saw it all. Time stood absolutely still as her fingertips slid across Agatha's palm and all at once, every single memory they had made, and what felt like every single memory they would ever make together slammed into her at full force. It was a flashing of colors, of lights, of smiles and tears. It was shouting and hand holding and sex and joy and satisfaction all at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     In the middle of the biggest emotional storm Rio had ever endured, there was Agatha, willing to risk her own well being to pull her out.
    </p>
<p>
     And, with the most certainty she'd had since she had woken up to the sound of her phone, she got to her feet and let Agatha lead the way to the car.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been restless and quiet the entire ride to the hospital, Agatha's fingers laced between her own in a firm hold. Agatha's free hand was tracing the faintest lines up Rio's forearm, just a steady back and forth that helped Rio center herself a little more. She was trying not to get caught up in the remaining minutes, but things started looking familiar again and she knew where they were.
    </p>
<p>
     Another few minutes and they were rolling up to the main entrance of the hospital.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha never once let go of her as she went through the motions of letting the woman at the front desk know who she was there to see. The woman directed them where to go and this time, it was Rio that was the one who was practically dragging Agatha along in her wake.
    </p>
<p>
     She was so close to her baby, but there was still space. Space that she had to close immediately. She had pushed the button for the elevator, but it was taking too long. She gave another strong pull on Agatha's hand as she threw open the door to the stairs, nearly taking them two at a time. Somehow, Agatha was keeping an even pace.
    </p>
<p>
     They reached the fourth floor, both of them red from their effort, but Rio was off again, her eyes scanning the room numbers until she saw the right one, swinging a hard right inside to see Taylah sat by the bed, holding the hand of her little girl.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes lifted to take the sight of Estrella in, and she could feel it all over again as her heart shattered in her chest. She was torn between wanting to rush to her child and wanting to also give overdue attention to the pseudo-child that had been the one to bring her home.
    </p>
<p>
     Although she didn't exactly want to, something inside Rio compelled her to let go of Agatha's hand as she paced over to behind where Tay sat. Rio laid an arm across her shoulder gently, leaning down to kiss the top of her head.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't know how to tell you how much you mean to me, Taylah. I know the last day has been hard and terrifying but... you've never left her side."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Of course, Mama Vidal. I love her."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's heart pattered softly in her chest; she knew she could have taken it at face value, but she'd been waiting for the penny to drop in that regard for years. Maybe this was what finally did it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio loosened her hold, pacing over to the side of the bed closest to where Estee's head was resting, those rich dark locks unruly as she laid there. Her crazy little girl, always getting herself into scrapes. Her features were smooth, and Rio knew that it wouldn't last. When she came to, she was going to hurt. She was going to be in pain for a good while, and it was going to be hard to deal with, but they would get her through it.
    </p>
<p>
     She had her tribe, her coven of women that were there for her, to love and support her through whatever the next months had to bring.
    </p>
<p>
     Her fingertips brushed along her daughter's hairline, over her cheeks, her nose. It was something she needed, to see and feel her little girl right there in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     The other two women were completely locked in on the exhange, just watching a terrified mother gaze lovingly at the daughter she could have lost. It was a moving display in every bit of its gravity, even causing tears to line Agatha's lids.
    </p>
<p>
     After a long few moments of Rio's quiet appreciation of the woman in that hospital bed, she leaned over to place a soft kiss across Estee's forehead. She straightened up and turned back to Tay, taking in her appearance for the first time.
    </p>
<p>
     She had a black eye, her wrist was in a cast and there were a few cuts on her arms. She got to her feet and without a single second of hesitation, Rio pulled her into her arms, hugging her as firmly as she could while still paying heed to the fact that she had just endured a severe trauma. She stood there for a long few moments, the silent tears spilling as she clung to her second daughter.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, she loosened her hold and pulled back to look down at the blonde, her eyes soft.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You've been a hero, baby. But maybe you should call your parents and get them to take you home so you can get some sleep."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Tay offered a slight twich of her lips, something that landed in the vicinity of being a ghost of a smile.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I texted them after you called me. They're waiting in the garage."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio placed a soft kiss to the side of her head and gave her shoulders a thankful squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Get some rest, mija."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you, Mama."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Tay placed a sweet and emotional peck to Rio's cheek and turned to make her way out, but she caught sight of Agatha and stopped, obviously a little stunned both that she had come with Rio, and that a Hollywood Director was standing right in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I hope you stay long enough that I get to actually meet you, but I'm going to go home and sleep. So... thank you, for not letting her do it alone."
    </p>
<p>
     Her voice had been soft, knowing that Agatha was close enough to hear it, and Rio likely was not, and was also probably very fixated on her daughter, too fixated to notice.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It was the least I could do. And for what it's worth, I hope we get to spend time together, too. I've heard a lot of good things."
     </i>
     Agatha's lips pulled into a warm smile despite the circumstance. She tilted her head toward the door.
     <i>
      "Sleep, kid. Doctor Rio's orders."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was the mother in her that seemed to take the wheel in that moment. She gave a gentle nod in Tay's direction as she turned and passed through the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had sat on the couch by the window, hardly able to take her eyes off of Rio's back as she sat, folded over with her arms beneath her head on the edge of the bed, her hand wrapped snugly around Estee's.
    </p>
<p>
     It was such a tender moment, one that was both heartbreaking in its reality and warming in its reaction. Maybe Rio really could have done this by herself, but... she was eternally in Agatha's debt that she didn't have to.
    </p>
<p>
     After about an hour, she sat up a little, though she didn't release Estee's hand. She looked back over her shoulder, though she couldn't see Agatha all the way without turning around.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey," Rio called softly, to which Agatha was on her feet, pacing to behind her, her hands falling immediately to Rio's shoulders in comfort.
    </p>
<p>
     "I really need to pee," she admitted, though her tone was soft in just how soaked in exhaustion it was. Those hours of sleep on the jet had not been able to cut it. "Can you... Can you just hold her hand? In case... in case she wakes up while I'm gone." Rio's voice caught on the last word as the emotion choked her.
     <i>
      "I don't want her to be alone."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "Of course, my love," Agatha breathed, leaning slightly to kiss the top of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood and before Agatha took her place, she pulled Rio into her arms firmly, just holding her steady for a few brief moments. As she loosened her grip, though, she was a little surprised as she felt Rio's soft lips brush against her own. It was something that could hardly have been constituted as a kiss, but Agatha had received the sentiment loud and clear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave her hand a soft squeeze and departed, leaving Agatha to slide into the chair at Estee's bedside, picking up her hand and holding it in both of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward in the chair, her eyes casting up to that beautiful woman in that bed, Rio's little girl forever and always. It hadn't been as noticeable over a phone screen, but she looked
     <i>
      so much
     </i>
     like her mother.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned forward, much like Rio had, laying her head on her arm as she held onto Estee's hand, letting her eyes slide closed.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't sure how long she'd had them closed, but she must have imagined it -- the slightest brush on the inside of her palm
    </p>
<p>
     Wait! There it was again. Agatha gently gripped back out of sheer reaction, but as she realized what was happening, she practically flew up, her eyes cutting right to Estee's face, which was now trying its hardest to scrunch in frustration as she fought her way back to consciousness.
    </p>
<p>
     Stuck, and not knowing what to say, Agatha simply gripped her hand back.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mama?"
     </i>
     came the lone, broken and rough word. Something in Agatha's chest squeezed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "She'll be right back, she had to pee,"
     </i>
     Agatha tried to explain in a gentle whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     The struggle continued as Estee fought to open her eyes, finally winning that war as she found herself staring at the ceiling and then, so slowly, her gaze dropped and landed right in Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "A-Agatha?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yeah, Estee, it's me."
     </i>

</p>

<p>
     The weight of the last twenty-four hours had settled on Rio like a wet jean jacket, awkward and heavy, weighing her down. At the same time, it felt like taking it off would leave her bare; sleep was not yet an option.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio had exited the room, intent for the washroom, a woman stood from a chair within the nurses' station and waved her over. She was tall, a bit lanky, but she had a kind smile. "You're Estrella's mother?" she posed, to which Rio gave a nod of acknowledgement.
    </p>
<p>
     "Both surgeries went well, and the second one was only necessary because of the location of the shard and how the dislocated bone had been covering it from x-ray. But she... You've got a tough kid on your hands."
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you. I guess I always knew it, I just never wanted to find out she could be
     <i>
      this
     </i>
     tough," she returned.
    </p>
<p>
     They quickly wrapped up the conversation with only essential questions from Rio, who departed back down her intended path.
    </p>
<p>
     As she emerged from the washroom down the hall from Estee's room, she glanced back toward it and her lips pressed together. The cafe wasn't far; she could grab them each a coffee and hopefully be back before Estee woke up.
    </p>
<p>
     She needed something to pick her up; Agatha was fairing pretty well on such a task, but physically, Rio was absolutely drained.
    </p>
<p>
     It was almost earth-shattering, to have a night like the one she and Agatha had gotten to experience the night before, to go out in those dresses while people looked at them, to have an incredible meal and expensive wine and then wake up to that phone call. It felt so far away, now, the way they'd nearly stumbled into the house, a flurry of lips and hands and sighs only to tangle in that bed for hours. It had become overshadowed by what had followed, and a deep part of Rio ached at that realization.
    </p>
<p>
     So, she had carried herself down and fetched them coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     Coffees that were still grasped in each hand as she got closer to Estee's room and heard -- was that laughter? Agatha's laughter?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's brow knit tight and she stepped into the doorway to see the source of the sound.
    </p>
<p>
     It was like a snapshot of a moment, something so stilled in time. There, in that chair by the bed, was Agatha, leaned forward, holding onto Estee's hand with both of her own. That wasn't the most striking thing about her, though. No, that was the absolute light that was touching every single crevice of Agatha's face, and every fleck in her irises, those blues burning like the hottest part of a fire.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze shifted, taking in the sight of her daughter -- awake and alert -- and talking softly with Agatha, who was clearly hanging on every word she had to say.
    </p>
<p>
     Neither of them seemed to notice her, and while her first inclination was to throw the coffees to the ground and run to smother her daughter in love?
    </p>
<p>
     There was something so... still about what she was seeing.
    </p>
<p>
     Her own first meeting with Nicky had, arguably, gone pretty fucking poorly.
    </p>
<p>
     But there she stood, watching as she absorbed the reality that Agatha was the first person Estee had seen when she had been able to open her eyes. Agatha had been the one there holding her hand. Agatha was the one there sitting with her, talking to her, laughing at whatever it was she was being told -- that beautiful fucking laugh -- with literal stars in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     It made her breath catch in her chest, but she was careful to keep it quiet as to not completely disrupt the moment. It was too tender, too precious. She just watched, silent reverence filling her entire being.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay," Estee managed, her lips pulling up. "So you're not pulling my leg with the jet thing? You really just called your friend and said 'Hey, let me borrow your jet?'" Rio could hear it, the tone of Estee's voice that all but indicated that she thought it was some tall tale.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean... that's pretty much how it went. I didn't tell him what I needed it for, but I promised him anything he wanted. He had joked before that if your
     <i>
      mama
     </i>
     and I decided to sell publishing rights to the story of how we met, he got first dibs."
    </p>
<p>
     It had been near impossible for Rio to keep her jaw clamped shut to keep the soft sound that wanted to escape her at the way Agatha had said that one word, the one word Estee and Tay both used so affectionately with her. It wasn't just that she had said it, it was the inflection she had put on it, like she understood that it was a different form of respect for Rio's heritage, and by extension, Estee's.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, when we landed, I had a message from him that said 'Those rights up for grabs yet?' Which, with the weight of not knowing if you were okay hanging over our heads at the time, wasn't the funniest. But --"
    </p>
<p>
     "It's pretty funny," Estee said, breathing a sweet but soft giggle, one that still made her wince.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes dropped, taking in the way Estee's thumb would flex or occasionally brush over Agatha's knuckle.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      She was doing it too!
     </i>
     Rio thought.
     <i>
      She had to make sure Agatha was really there!
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      Like mother, like daughter.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "I still can't believe you guys literally got on a plane at five in the morning. I think it's because mama knew if she waited until I woke up, I would have told her I was fine and not to come home and then she would have had an entire existential crisis," Estee managed through measured breaths, very visibly fighting off the ache that was gripping her entire body to instead focus on this bonding moment with this woman she knew her mother loved so dearly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio saw this shift happen in her, though. This new look crossed her face, and bled into the way her eyes softened as she looked at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't sizing her up, wasn't trying to scrutinize or pick her apart.
    </p>
<p>
     No, Estee was simply... regarding her. She was looking for, and quickly finding all of these reasons that Agatha was the one that was sitting right there. She could see, in those blue eyes, where her mother could get lost. She could see in that smile, where her mother might find a daily source of warmth. She could hear it, in those soft spoken and warmly rich tones, where her mother could find sounds that soothed her.
    </p>
<p>
     Very quickly, Estee could see almost every single reason her mother had fallen for this woman.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, also," Agatha voiced, as if something had just dawned on her. "Tay was here until we got here and your mom strong-armed her into going home. Her parents flew in, too, and they're staying at your apartment, so they came to pick her up. But... She's a great friend."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, there was another shift in Estee, her eyes getting a little glassy in the fluorescent lights of the hospital room.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was holding her breath, clinging to the tension like it were as thin and fraught as a tight rope.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know those big moments in life where... you just kind of realize that you might have prioritized the wrong things?" Estee asked Agatha softly, and Agatha gave a knowing nod in response. "I was conscious for a little bit, after we were hit. It was hard to talk, or breathe, but..." The emotion seemed to surge inside of her, but she took a very slow breath in and then let it go just as slowly. "I felt her holding my hand. I heard her telling me we were going to be okay." Her voice shook, though, and Rio could see the slight movement as she gripped harder at Agatha's hands.
    </p>
<p>
     Severely, in every depth of every well that resided in Rio, she both felt her own swell of overwhelming emotion, and saw as it washed over Agatha's face, too. Rio was still fighting herself to remain still and quiet, but she absolutely could not break this, or even dream of interrupting it.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have spent the last thirteen years of my life with her. We had sleepovers every single weekend, mama taught us to surf together. We have explored every available inch of this island that we can get to. I have experienced so many of the best moments of my life with her right beside me. And as it turns out, I experienced a pretty bad one with her, too."
    </p>
<p>
     The pause she took instilled a heavy and thick silence, one that was filled with such unspoken affection from all three women in the room.
    </p>
<p>
     "And I... I'm scared that if I tell her how I feel... she won't feel the same way."
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't think you have to worry about that, mija,"
     </i>
     came Rio's voice from the doorway.
    </p>
<p>
     Both of their eyes were wide, a little shocked that they had not otherwise noticed that she had been there, or how long she had been there.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio paced over to the small stool that the doctor would often use when in the room and pulled it over next to Agatha, handing over one of the coffees before she shuffled around her to resume the stationing she had momentarily taken earlier when they had first arrived, up by Estee's head.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hand hung out with her own coffee out of sheer positioning, but she felt as Agatha gently plucked it from her fingers so that she could choose to embrace her daughter how she wanted to.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned over her, kissing her forehead again, the now-free hand cupping under her chin and up her cheek, a lightly affectionate hold.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I am so happy you're okay, mija. You scared me, dios mio!"
     </i>
     Though her words were gently chastising, her tone was anything but. It was soft, it was full of love, full of concern, full of adoration.
    </p>
<p>
     "
     <i>
      I'm happy you're here, mama,"
     </i>
     she murmured back softly, her eyes sliding shut in the warm comfort of her mother's hold. Her eyes opened again, this time landing back on Agatha.
     <i>
      "And I'm happy you didn't make Agatha stay in America."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Ay, mija. Not now; let me love on you a little longer before you start being ornery."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "Oh, so she get's it honestly, then?" Agatha offered up with a breathy chuckle. This drew a response from both Vidal women who managed the softest, sweetest giggles.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio gently released her hold on her daughter and turned to go back to the chair, she caught sight of Agatha, who honestly looked like she was fighting for air.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you alright, my love?" Rio posed, her genuine curiosity heavy over her words.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked, her gaze snapping up to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      She was blushing.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     And judging the additional giggle behind her, Estee could see it.
    </p>
<p>
     "That sound..." she managed, looking like she had put forth some serious effort into getting those words out. As it processed, though, there was a familiar shimmering in her eyes, an impossible softness that often made Rio weak in the knees.
     <i>
      "It was beautiful."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's tender smile was immediate on her lips. She placed a gentle hand on Agatha's shoulder and bent enough to kiss the side of her head before relinquishing all contact to take her seat on the other side of Agatha. As she sat and lifted her head, it was now Estee's turn to be staring at her in complete awe.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mama,"
     </i>
     Estee gushed, her eyes widening slightly. "This is literally the cutest thing I have ever seen. Are you sure that you guys haven't been secretly dating for like at least three to five years? Because... that's the vibes," she offered, accentuating with a weak flicker of her hand between the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's knee lightly nestled directly against the side of Agatha's as she handed over the coffee back to its rightful owner, glancing at her with a shy smile that she didn't want Estee to catch the entire gravity of.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, how long am I stuck here?" Estee decided to state as the segue into how much different life was going to work for the next three weeks while she finished her classes and took exams.
    </p>
<p>
     "The doctor said that if you react well to all medications, she's comfortable letting you go home tomorrow. She wants to check both incisions to make sure that there's no indication of infection. Doc said that she's willing to write up any paperwork she needs to so that you can do your schoolwork and exams from home, because it's three weeks of bed rest for you, mija."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's soured expression truly indicated just how dissatisfied she was by this answer, but Rio was not quite finished.
    </p>
<p>
     "After bed rest, you start physical therapy. Three times a week, ninety minutes. Between myself and Tay, we'll get you there, so don't fight when the time comes, yeah?" Rio posed, tilting her head as if it might somehow be convincing enough to work.
    </p>
<p>
     Tay.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's face softened again, as if realizing that they had not quite finished their conversation from earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     "What did you mean, mama? About Tay?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's expression seemed to dissolve into this enlightened sense of affection.
    </p>
<p>
     "She's been here the
     <i>
      whole
     </i>
     time. When she called me, she was here and you were going into your first surgery. She was texting me updates, and she immediately gave me one when she picked up the phone the moment we got here." Rio paused, gently biting her top lip as the emotion because to snake a grip around her throat. "When we came into the room? She was poured over you, clutching onto your hand with her one good one. She looked like she'd been crying since the second it happened, but she wasn't letting you go for anything until I got here."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took in a slow, deep breath as she tried to re-steel her bubbling of emotion.
    </p>
<p>
     "She protected you. She took care of you. And even though she's told me a million times before that she loves you... This time, it was different. This time, I think she meant it more."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's eyes began to leak and she swallowed down the realization that maybe she wasn't as insane as she had thought she might be.
    </p>
<p>
     "She texted me while I was grabbing coffee. She said that you get to pick who you'd rather crash with you tonight, us or her. She said she didn't care either way, but just to let her know."
    </p>
<p>
     In that moment, when presented with such a choice? Estee looked truly torn. Of course she wanted her mother around, she wanted to feel that safety that came so easily in her presence, and she was quite enjoying not only the effect that Agatha was having on Rio, but also that she was an incredibly easy person to talk to.
    </p>
<p>
     On the other side of that coin, though? Rio could see so clearly as she laid there in the bed, suddenly realizing the weight of her own feelings in regards to someone she had suppressed feelings for... for a very, very long time. She might have been beat all to hell, but that girl had a look of determination in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Her gaze cast up to Rio's, her lips twisting in thought for just a beat longer.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could speak, Agatha had something to offer.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can put us in a nearby hotel, that way... Tay can come back, and we're close enough that if you need her," Agatha indicated with a tip of her head toward Rio, "then she can come right back."
    </p>
<p>
     There it was again, that melting right in her middle. Rio shifted her coffee to her far hand and set the newly-freed one on Agatha's knee, giving a gentle caress with her thumb.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's eyes fell to Rio's, as if in silent question.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio smiled, soft and genuine.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll text her and tell her to come on back."
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama?" Estee suddenly asked.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     hungry. And a pizza sounds...
     <i>
      exquisite.
     </i>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     Rio breathed a soft laugh, her eyes casting up to the morphine drip they'd inserted into her intravenous line; clearly, it was working.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can order us a couple of pizzas and ask if Tay's parents wouldn't mind stopping to pick them up when they bring her back."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's soft hunter green gaze swept back and forth between them as she tried to temper her reaction to ask the questions that still ended up falling off of her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "You'll both stay and eat with us?" she asked, her tone edging on hopeful.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee had never been starved for attention, ever in her life. That was something that Rio had worked her hardest to make sure of. But what Rio was realizing as she took in that look on her face, and listened to what she said and how she said it? What Estee now wanted more of was this experience of Rio basking in the light of another human, someone who saw her for every incredible part and piece she had.
    </p>
<p>
     What Estee had ached for, her entire life, was to see her mother find that comforting warmth that could come with the genuine emotion of love, and it was more than obvious to see that she'd not only found it, but Rio had made sure to wrap it around the pair of them. It was beautiful in the most touching way, and Estee hardly knew how to start processing that it was real, that she could literally sit there and look and them, right there in front of her. She could see the inherent happiness that came from being close to one another, that gentle buzz of raw affection that surrounded them.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee was seeing what soulmates looked like.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course we will, mija."
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     And so, stay they had.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had done as promised after getting the approval from Tay's father that he could stop to pick them up food. She ordered Estee's favorite for her and Tay -- double cheese with extra mushroom -- and she and Agatha had settled on a classic pepperoni. Roughly twenty minutes later, Tay had come through the door, her dad behind her with the boxes, and a third that he informed Rio was a box of brownies he had purchased in addition.
    </p>
<p>
     She set the boxes down on the table and moved to give him a gentle hug, thanking him softly.
    </p>
<p>
     He told her to let them know if they needed anything at all and departed to leave the women to the rest of their evening.
    </p>
<p>
     They had shared pizza and just talked for hours. The girls asked their fair share of questions, and it had almost felt like a bit of an interrogation, but Agatha had not buckled ones under the weight of their grilling. It wasn't malicious, or even slightly genuine. They had clearly been playful in their fascination and simply wanted to understand it more, wanted to admire it for all it was.
    </p>
<p>
     As the night wore on, though, it had become pretty clear that everyone was growing tired. Honestly? Rio had been pretty surprised that Estee had lasted so long; she had watched over the course of the evening as the exhaustion had begun to creep into those soft and beautiful expressions, the light in her eyes dimming ever so slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "We should probably head out soon so you two can get the rest you need," Rio acknowledged in a smooth but comforting tone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you know where you'll be?" Estee asked, her tone tinged with the slight edge of nerves.
    </p>
<p>
     "I just booked us a room at the Millennium. It's about a twelve minute walk from here, so an even faster Uber," Agatha volunteered; as annoying as that might have seemed to anyone else, to have someone answer for her, there was something so... endearing about it. Agatha knew her, and Agatha always seemed to know what to do, even in the most high-pressure situations.
    </p>
<p>
     This seemed to be good enough for Estee, who relaxed back into the pillows.
    </p>
<p>
     They had ended up giving their hugs, Rio stealing her head and forehead kisses at each chance she could get during the goodbye exchange. She had looked each of the girls in the eye and told them how much she loved them. When she had tucked her chin over Estee's shoulder, though, she murmured a soft encouragement.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You'll probably sleep better if you tell her before you turn in."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could hear as her daughter breathed out a knowing huff, giving her shoulder the lightest squeeze as she pulled back.
    </p>
<p>
     "Los amos, mijas. Call if you need anything."
    </p>
<p>
     The harmonizing response?
    </p>
<p>
     "Te amo, mama," the girls said in unison, causing a wave of warmth to wash over her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Te veo, sweet girls."
    </p>
<p>
     Hand in hand, she and Agatha made their way out of the hospital and decided to make the trek, with their duffel bags, by foot.
    </p>
<p>
     The night had grown balmy, but not too hot. It was a gentle dusting of heat in the evening air. It would undoubtedly taper off once the sun sank a little lower, but for now, it was pleasant enough for the sake of comfort on their walk.
    </p>
<p>
     "So..." Agatha began, shooting a sideways glance at the woman next to her. "How long, exactly, were you in the doorway?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's magnanimous grin was wide an instant.
    </p>
<p>
     "Long enough to admire the view."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah? And what did you like about it?" Agatha asked back, though her voice had dropped in volume, and it had lost its questioning edge. This was just a genuine attempt at looking in on some of the thoughts she didn't swear she could already hear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was quiet in her consideration for a few moments as they continued to walk. She wanted to say it right, to make her understand it in acutely the right way.
    </p>
<p>
     "I liked the look on your face, like you were looking at every star in the sky at one time. You get that look when you look at Nicky, too."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's chin tucked and Rio could almost sense the heat of the blush that crept to her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     "She is..." Agatha began, but it was clear that she quickly could not locate the right words. "She is so very much your daughter, first of all," she informed her, a gentle laugh blossoming from her lips. "But she's also... I don't know how to say it. We talked alone for all of maybe ten minutes and she's just... What a ray of light."
    </p>
<p>
     She was, wasn't she? It was the same thought that had passed through Rio's mind that day she had dropped Estee off to come back down this way.
    </p>
<p>
     "She's always been my
     <i>
      entire
     </i>
     world. And she's still a very large part of it. But... I think she is undoubtedly thrilled that there's something else there that she gets to share space with." Rio's grip on Agatha's hand tightened and she very smoothly, in rhythm with their walking, leaned over to steal the briefest peck off of Agatha's cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     "She can take up all the room she wants, I will gladly occupy what is left."
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the walk was only a couple of moments and check in was rather seamless. They were closing the door to the room behind them as their bags almost hit the floor in perfect unison, a soft
     <i>
      thud
     </i>
     sounding as they did so. Rio stretched, but then cast her glance over to Agatha, who was at the foot of the bed, preparing the bed so that they could simply climb into it and let themselves release some of the tension they'd been holding for the last day.
    </p>
<p>
     She was quiet in her method, but Rio couldn't keep away long enough to let her finish. She padded over behind her, securing her arms firmly around Agatha's middle, who stopped her work and straightened back up, a content hum passing through slightly parted lips.
    </p>
<p>
     As she reached full height, Rio turned her head and pressed her cheek to Agatha's shoulder, just holding her close, trying to somehow convey to her the weightiness of every ounce of love she felt for her. She knew that at this point? Trying to put a word to it was a fruitless. Rio could spend days, weeks even, pouring over a thesaurus and she still somehow would never have been able to find the right word, or even combination, that could somehow put that feeling into words.
    </p>
<p>
     She had always believed that there was a right way to say anything, but as she nearly clung to Agatha at the foot of the bed?
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe what they said was true; maybe love was speechless, in its most tender happenings.
    </p>
<p>
     They simply stood in the totality of the moment, just letting it lay and fill the space around them with their closeness, both physical and emotional. For a brief ticking of a second, Rio considered that they could have very well just fallen asleep like that, but she finally released her embrace, her hands landing without initiative on Agatha's sides as she placed a soft kiss to the fabric of her shirt above her right shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Begrudgingly, she released that contact and helped her finish readying the bed. When they finished, she slid out of her leggings and crawled onto the large, plush bed, finding an immediate home in the middle. As Agatha did the same, meeting her in a tangle of legs and embraces?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio really paused, for just an additional beat, to both ask and acknowledge:
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Is this really the life I've gotten the chance to live?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      It is. So keep choosing it.
     </i>

<i>
       I feel right at home in my town, happy day
       <br/>
       And step out into the freezing morning air.
      </i>
</p>
<p>

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     As Rio opened her eyes into the morning of a new day, it actually took her a moment to reintegrate herself into the reality she was living, but it was in a far different way than the last time she had woken up in an unfamiliar hotel room.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio had woken up for the first time in The Freehand, she'd opened her eyes into that empty room, the panic of Agatha's absence filling her and overflowing her in a fear that she had somehow made the wrong choice. And then those eyes had swept over the room, landing on the lingering traces of Agatha, ones that held a promise of her return.
    </p>
<p>
     What she had right then, as she opened her eyes in their suite -- which she had chastised as being entirely unnecessary at one point before they had fallen asleep -- was tangible, was right there under her arm. What she had was Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Even as Rio laid there, the sleep still chewing at the edges of her consciousness, she watched Agatha, an unwitnessed and unbridled devotion reflecting in her gaze. She could still see it so easily, the way she had held effortless conversation with Estee, like they'd spent hours of time together before. If anyone else would have been blessed enough to bear witness to what Rio had witnessed from that doorway? They would have assumed that Agatha was likely some form of parental figure to Estee, someone that had an amazing relationship with her, not that they were meeting for the very first time.
    </p>
<p>
     It had really been the look on Agatha's face -- it was like a beacon of light that sat on a coast just far enough away in the middle of a thundering storm.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio had become the observer in that situation, she had been feeling pretty hopeless. She had taken to heeding Agatha's request to give herself a break, but there had still been this emptiness, this feeling as though she had done something wrong, that had been gnawing at the pit of Rio's stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't a bad mother, she knew that. But... She was getting closer, step by step, to having a massive and impossible choice close enough to stare her directly in the eyes. She was going to have to find a way to sit down, to map out her entire life and figure out what pieces might be able to move and where. She was going to have to find a way that this could work. It had to work.
    </p>
<p>
     If there were no more moments in her future where she got to look in from the outside on any tender exchange between the two women she loved most in the world, Rio wasn't sure that was any kind of life she wanted to be living.
    </p>
<p>
     Even without having had a one-on-one conversation with Estee yet, Rio saw it. She saw the way she looked at Agatha, like the gratitude was just consistently pouring out of her, like she was so thankful that someone finally understood what an absolute gem her mother was. Of course Rio never felt as grand as the pedestal her daughter had placed her on, but Rio supposed that she had always looked at her papa like that, even if he had always insisted that he was a deeply flawed man.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio realized, laying there as she looked at the serenity blanketing Agatha's beautiful face, was that seeing them? Hearing them? Hell, hearing Estee be so quick to talk about her feelings for Tay with Agatha before she brought it up to her? It had been a lighting quick flash of realization:
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't just Rio. Estee felt it too.
    </p>
<p>
     The magnetic pull that would forever be Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee had been helpless when it came to not being pulled in by that gravitational force that seemed to extend out and encircle Agatha, much in the same way Rio had.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was pulled from thought at the sound of a soft snore across the few inches between them, an instantly delighted smile curling up her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Judging by the way the sun was coming through the window, it was still pretty early.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft grumble sounded low in Rio's stomach and she breathed a light sigh out of her nose, shifting slightly to her back, though that simply left Agatha's arm draped over her middle instead of her side.
    </p>
<p>
     She could probably make it to the bakery she knew was a few blocks over and back by the time Agatha woke up, but the idea of leaving the safe haven of that bed?
    </p>
<p>
     Another grumble.
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, so maybe it wasn't really much of an option. She laid like that for a few more moments before carefully, she removed herself from beneath Agatha's hold and placed a soft kiss to her temple. She turned and busied herself with the task of getting ready for the day. Once she was dressed and looked presentable -- although the dark circles under her eyes could have been better -- she grabbed the room key and slid out, setting out into the balmy Queenstown morning.
    </p>
<p>
     She had maybe only been gone thirty or forty minutes, but as Rio came down the hallway -- pastries and coffees in hand -- she'd heard it from a few doors down.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the sound of Agatha's voice, and it was
     <i>
      loud.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     A deep line formed in Rio's brow as she approached the door, hovering outside of it as she tried to get a gentle grasp on what she was about to be walking into.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't care about the fucking permits, Dave. Let them expire. So what if we wait a year?"
    </p>
<p>
     Then another voice, a man's voice, sounded, though it was softer, like it was on speakerphone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha, you've already put four MILLION dollars into this project, and now you want to push it off a YEAR?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, Dave, that is very clearly what I said. I do not believe anywhere in that statement did I stutter."
    </p>
<p>
     "You realize that this is insane, right? This was going to be the next year and a half of your life, and now suddenly it just doesn't matter? You were so invested in making this happen, even before you started location scouting. What the fuck changed that you're staring career suicide in the face?"
    </p>
<p>
     The loud, sardonic bark of a laugh was absolutely scorching in its heat as it boomed out of Agatha's throat.
    </p>
<p>
     "Dave, do you know how many Oscars I have sitting on a shelf in the den of my home?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, Agatha, I do."
    </p>
<p>
     "So, then, are you
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     going to sit there and try to make me feel like if I push this film back eight to ten months for deeply personal reasons, I'm going to lose my career?" Her voice was so sharp, so calculated, so measured with the intention behind every single word that left Agatha's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio realized that she was holding her breath, waiting on Dave's response.
    </p>
<p>
     "This has to do with the woman on TMZ, doesn't it?"
    </p>
<p>
     Somehow, even though she had been holding her breath, it still caught in Rio's chest at what he asked.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did not hesitate in her response. "The answer to that question, either way, is inconsequential to this conversation. I've made my decision, and now I task you with the duty of relaying the message to the team."
    </p>
<p>
     "But! You're the one --"
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, David. Have a great rest of your day!"
    </p>
<p>
     The faint beep that signified the end of the call was so very faint through the door, but Rio still heard it.
    </p>
<p>
     She was stuck, frozen, not knowing how to completely process the conversation she surely had not been meant to hear. It was become a recurring pattern, wasn't it? Rio accidentally getting glimpses of the pieces of Agatha that she should not have been privy to?
    </p>
<p>
     She was playing it over in her head, trying to piece it together so that it made sense. The only conclusion she had reached?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was putting a pin in her current project and nothing in Rio needed to ask the question to know why.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio could sometimes swear she could hear Agatha in the depths of her own mind, in that moment it was almost deafening.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      I am prioritizing. I am putting what's most important first. I am doing the right thing.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Slowly, and with slightly shaky movements, Rio raised her free hand and slid the key into the door, pushing it open with a trace of uncertainty.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, who had clearly been in the throes of an intense pace, stopped suddenly in the middle of the room. The look she had been wearing before her halting had been tight and focused, pulled together in sheer concentration. The moment she stilled, though, and looked up to see Rio?
    </p>
<p>
     It thawed in the matter of a second, so much relief weaving into every tense muscle.
    </p>
<p>
     "I brought breakfast," Rio offered softly, holding up the holder with the coffees and the bag that held the pastries in one hand.
    </p>
<p>
     With a breath, the tension seemed to completely evaporate, Agatha's shoulders slumping slightly in surrender. She crossed the few remaining feet of space between them as one hand found Rio's side and the other wrapped around the small of her back, bringing her in close enough so that their fronts were pressed together and she could tip her head down slightly to grace Rio's lips with the gentlest kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      How did Agatha do that?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio wondered at what point she was ever going to stop asking that question. The reality of it was that Agatha found new ways to amaze  her every single day and she had this feeling in her bones that the wonder might not actually ever go away.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't have to say a word, and yet Rio could feel all at once how much Agatha needed her presence when she was actively working to turn her own world on its head.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took the soft kiss, even feeding back enough to make sure Agatha was aware of how she was feeling. As she pulled away, emerald pools finding those azure ones, she could see it; it was the brief crackle of a storm, darkening those blue shades the slightest bit. In fact, perhaps no one else might have noticed it, but it was glaring Rio directly in the soul. She didn't want to force Agatha into telling her about that conversation, but she also felt nervous about admitting to eavesdropping.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I..."
     </i>
     Rio managed, her eyes darting back and forth as she tried to find the best way to blow that storm back, to keep it from rolling in deeper.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I heard you..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha's face fell, but not in a frown. Instead, she looked like she had been caught red-handed. It was almost... adorable?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You... could have told me you were thinking about doing that,"
     </i>
     Rio murmured at her softly, raising a hand to rest on Agatha's sternum, her fingers mindlessly brushing from the innermost curve of one collarbone, over the divot at the base of her throat, to the other innermost curve of the opposing collarbone. It was a gently affectionate movement a back and forth of calculated presence on Rio's end.
    </p>
<p>
     That look on Agatha's face as Rio lifted her eyes to look away from her own hand?
    </p>
<p>
     She looked utterly helpless.
    </p>
<p>
     "I wasn't..." she managed back, though by the way her tongue clung to the roof of her mouth and the way her throat bobbed that Agatha's mouth was bone dry. She was...
     <i>
      nervous?
     </i>
     This was fascinating to Rio, simply for the fact that this was a facet of Agatha that she had not really had an opportunity to see yet. "I just..."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cut herself off, clamping her lips together in a tight line as she emotion fought to bubble its way out of her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     "I opened my eyes a little bit ago and when I could not see or feel you in bed next to me, I..." Another sudden pause, Agatha's jaw clenching as she tried to build her resolve, though Rio had hardly found herself able to tear her eyes out of the depths of Agatha's. She could see it there, building, the utter piety that consumed her when she looked at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "I panicked, in those first few seconds, before everything came back. And I realized... Sinking my time into eighteen months of a project that yes, I am passionate about, but that would keep me on a seemingly endless schedule of not really knowing my own availability?" Agatha's hand raised, cradling Rio's jaw in the crook of her hold. "I'm just not ready. I
     <i>
      wanted
     </i>
     to make the film. I
     <i>
      need
     </i>
     to be here, for both as long as you need me, and as long as you'll have me."
    </p>
<p>
     The tears that were indicative of just how moved Rio was sprung to life, pouring down her cheeks rather unceremoniously.
    </p>
<p>
     The hand that had been idling on Agatha's sternum slid up, over the side of the neck, fingers curling toward the back of Agatha's head into her hair as she pulled her toward her, placing the most loving kiss across her lips. She knew she could have told Agatha a million times over that she loved her, but she knew that it would never cut it. It would never be loud enough.
    </p>
<p>
     So, she let her actions speak for her instead. She let the way her lips skimmed Agatha's just barely there be the loudest shout in the room. She let the way she was cradling her, that giant, beautiful brain nearly in the palm of her hand, be the underline of emphasis on what, exactly, she was trying to convey.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a loud
     <i>
      ding!
     </i>
     from her back pocket and she could feel, there against her lips, as Agatha's own slid into a blithe smile.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I bet that's our beckoning,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed against her lips, though Rio was just a little too hung on the moment to let it go that easily.
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed forward, stealing another kiss, this one a little more present, a little more aware. She did not let it linger long, though, and pulled away to retrieve her phone, her hold releasing as she felt Agatha take hold of the coffee and bag in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Hey, mama. We're awake, so whenever you guys get up, feel free to come when you're ready.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "They're up," Rio offered warmly, as she typed back her response.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      We're getting ready now. I went to  Ma Boulangerie and picked you both up some lamingtons and mock cream donuts. We'll be there shortly. I love you.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha padded back over to her, holding out the coffee to her. She took it with a soft thanks and took a sip, feeling the warmth slide all of the way into her chest.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mmmm, they seriously have the best coffee I've ever had,"
     </i>
     Rio hummed, clearly having a moment of peace over the mundane pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
     "It is pretty good, but those pastries smell delicious. Are we going to eat breakfast with the girls?" Agatha posed, tilting her head adorably in question.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a nod. "Yeah, I had picked them up a few things, too. I figured either you and I could eat if they were still sleeping, or we could all eat together. Glad to see it worked out."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached up between them, her thumb landing on Rio's chin while her index finger curled securely, the smallest hold, but it was firm. Their gazes met and there it was again, Agatha staring right into her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What do you see when you do that?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The question clearly caught Agatha off guard by the way her expression tightened in one moment, but then smoothed in the next.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips parted, but then pressed. Her throat quivered slightly as the emotion bobbed somewhere in the middle of it, rising and sinking with every push of a wave. Her jaw set a bit forward and Rio could really see that she was holding an inner war on how she wanted to answer that question, so she offered a gentle reassurance.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You can tell me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The lone tear caught Rio off guard this time, but she was quick to reach up, brushing it off the velvety smooth skin of Agatha's cheek.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I see the rest of my life."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     For every time she had thought she had felt it before? Rio knew that anything she had considered before that moment paled in comparison to what it felt like right then.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      What it felt like as she was struck by Agatha's lightning.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The emotion in Rio's own expression was immediate and heavy, nearly causing her features to crumple, but it was not because it was she was upset. It was because she was completely and entirely heart-struck.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hand raised, fingertips ever-so-gentle as her graced the angle of Agatha's jaw, the sheer astonishment practically bleeding out of her. She tipped her head forward, the skin of their foreheads meeting in shared warmth.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I am so in love with you, Agatha Harkness, that I can hardly think straight."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Well,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed at her, her tone reverent.
     <i>
      "If you thought straight, this probably wouldn't work out too well."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The giggles that erupted between them were boisterous and bright, lifting every bit of tension out of the room, carrying it high to the floors above them.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come on,"
     </i>
     Agatha beguiled, giving a playful tap to the cheek of Rio's ass, a grin filling her face.
     <i>
      "We've got an episode or two of 'Kiwi Love' to catch up on."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's grin was so wide that she was almost certain her face was going to crack. The fact that Agatha had just given a name to the saga of what could turn into Estee and Tay's relationship left Rio feeling so completely filled with love and adoration that she could have just floated away and had zero qualms about the view.
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     Hand in hand, Rio and Agatha had gotten out of the car and made their way back up to where they knew Estee's room to be, though they were cautious as they reached the doorway. Like a couple of absolute snoops, the two older women carefully slid the top most parts of their heads into the doorway, peering inside.
    </p>
<p>
     There, on the hospital bed, laid both women. Estee was on her back and Tay was curled against her good side, resting her head on Estee's shoulder. They were having a soft back-and-forth of a conversation and Tay was absentmindedly toying with Estee's fingers in her own. Her eyes would occasionally sweep up, a smile crossing her face at something Estee had told her.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been a good three or four minutes before Estee had glanced over at the door, just barely catching sight of her mother's eyes poking from the outside of the door frame, with Agatha's head a couple of inches above hers.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's grin was wide and instant, sweeping cleanly across her beautiful features.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good morning!" she chirped, and while Tay turned to see what she was looking at, also dissolving into soft giggles, she did not otherwise move from her spot against Estee's side.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio both straightened and came through the door, both of them lit up like Christmas trees in the dead of a winter night.
    </p>
<p>
     "Gloating does not suit either of you," Estee advised, raising a brow in taunting challenge, though the smile broke out a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
     "So..." Rio began as she pulled up the stool, offering the chair again to Agatha. "I get to consider the possibility where some day I might
     <i>
      actually
     </i>
     be your mama, even if it's mama-in-law?" Her eyes found Tay's hazel ones, causing Tay's grin to sprout immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     "Let's not put the cart before the horse, now," Tay teased back, but Rio didn't miss the way her arm tightened so gently across Estee's middle.
    </p>
<p>
     "The cart rolled down the hill a long time ago, loves," Rio offered back with a soft laugh. "You're just horseback riding at this point."
    </p>
<p>
     This earned her a gentle poke in the ribs from Agatha, causing the sweetest giggle to flitter from her lips as she swatted Agatha's hand away, though in the next second, she leaned into her, their arms forming a solid brace.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached down to where Agatha had set the bag between them and pulled out the box, doling out pastries.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have not had a lamington in so long," Estee gushed as she picked one out of the box, behold it for the true treat it was.
    </p>
<p>
     "A lamington?" Agatha questioned, seeking clarification.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's two pieces of cake," Tay offered, picking up one of her own. "And they put cream and jam in the middle, cover it with simple syrup and coat it with coconut. It's so good."
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So good,"
     </i>
     Estee echoed before she took a bite, humming her immediate satisfaction.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had picked up one of the donuts and held it up to Agatha in question. "Wanna split it? They're pretty rich, so it's hard for me to have a whole one to myself."
    </p>
<p>
     That tender shimmer rippled over those blue pools, causing Rio's stomach to squeeze in delight. Agatha nodded and Rio set to her work of pulling it apart before she handed half of it over. Agatha thanked her, leaning in to steal the briefest -- but sweetest -- peck.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let her adoring gaze linger just a moment, but when she moved it?
    </p>
<p>
     Both Estee and Tay were staring at the two of them, the biggest fucking grins across their faces.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, knock it off, you two," she chastised, though the smile was still audible in her voice, even if it had not been apparently written all over her face.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, the four of them had taken up post in that hospital room for the majority of the day, and the doctor had come in to let them know that they had planned to discharge her on the evening after one more course of antibiotics.
    </p>
<p>
     At this, they had discussed between the four of them what this was going to look like.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt comfortable enough with the idea of letting Estee go home, knowing that both Tay and her parents were there for the time being. Surely, they would know the moment the other couple decided to return to Melbourne, and would be expected to give up the hotel to instead occupy the spare room in their spacious apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     The plan they were currently making was for the three weeks moving forward, but Rio was all too aware that they were going to have to work something out beyond that. Surely, both girls would want to go back to Auckland to at least enjoy what they could of their summer before they set to the daunting task of beginning their careers. And Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was all too aware of that fact that Agatha had pretty much cleared her schedule for the next eight months, at least, but what did that mean? How did it correlate to the relationship between the two of them? How long would she stay?
    </p>
<p>
     That, Rio decided, was an inner turmoil she could ruminate on some other day.
    </p>
<p>
     They had wrapped their planning with the agreement that Agatha and Tay were going to run to the shop to pick up necessities and then head to the apartment to get everything set up how it would need to be in order to accommodate Estee's return.
    </p>
<p>
     It was something out of a rom-com, the way Agatha and Tay both leaned down over each of the Vidal women, gracing them with the softest of kisses before departing.
    </p>
<p>
     For a long moment, two sets of green eyes just stared at the empty doorway in longing and love.
    </p>
<p>
     As if they both realized what they were doing at the exact moment, their glances snapped back to one another and faces were mirrored reflections of sheepish grins.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, I see your conversation went well," Rio offered, and the welling of emotion behind Estee's eyes was instant.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama, I didn't have to
     <i>
      say a word.
     </i>
     She crawled in next to me, asking me if it hurt me and if I was okay, and she laid her head on my chest." Estee's eyes flickered upward, clearly trying to keep the gripping hold of that emotion at bay. "She was just... drawing shapes on my chest. And like it was the most normal thing in the world, she said 'You know I'm in love with you, right?'"
    </p>
<p>
     The few tears that had been building behind Estee's eyes finally spilled as the truly happy smile tugged on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... we just laid here most of the night. She let me hold her, I let her kiss me. I..." Estee's eyes raised, meeting Rio's across the small space that sat between them. She breathed a disbelieving chuckle. "If two months ago you would have told me that us Vidals would ever both be in healthy relationships, I probably would have laughed my entire ass off."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a knowing shrug and got to her feet. She paced around to Estee's good side and kicked off her shoes before, so intently and carefully, she lowered herself onto the bed, laying against her daughter's side.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I think that love is a good look on us, don't you?"
     </i>
     Rio posed, reaching down to cover the back of Estee's hand with her own, giving it a loving squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I think it's long overdue."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Me too, mija. Me too. So let's soak it up while we have it, hm?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Estee's hand flexed under Rio's touch as she lifted her fingers, encouraging Rio to fill the gaps, and Rio obliged.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you..." Estee began, the timid edge to her tone not going unnoticed. "Do you know how long Agatha is going to stay?"
    </p>
<p>
     A soft puff of air blew through Rio's nose, rustling the rippled fabric of Estee's hospital gown just slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "She... I don't, right now, but... When I came back from picking up breakfast, she was in the room yelling at someone on the phone. I... kind of eavesdropped." Rio's lips worried together for a moment, but she found her voice again. "She has indefinitely postponed the project she came here for in the first place. For, as she put it 'deeply personal reasons.'"
    </p>
<p>
     Estee let out a low squeal, giving Rio's hand a tight squeeze in a show of sheer thrill and happiness.
    </p>
<p>
     They had laid like that for a couple of hours longer, Rio basking in the utter magnificence that was this daughter she had somehow managed to raise into an incredible human being. The doctor returned, this time with discharge papers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had checked her phone to a text from Tay stating that her dad was going to come pick them up and that he had already started to head that way. By the time they get Estee down to the ground floor, the car was waiting by the door, a gentle smile on Jaxin's face as he helped Rio get her into the car.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd shared another hug, Rio showering him in her endless gratitude before they headed back to the apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     It had taken a measurable amount of time to get the girls settled, but they seemed to be doing alright. Rio and Agatha had even busied themselves for a short while in the kitchen, whipping up a quick meal of enchiladas with what was in the refrigerator. The six of them had all eaten together and Agatha had been the one to tend to cleaning up, further softening that weak spot Rio had in her chest for her.
    </p>
<p>
     The girls were tired, though, and Jaxin and Mariella both announced they were turning in for the night. It was a good seven minute long exchange of hugs and kisses and 'see you tomorrow's as the affection in that room reached critical mass.
    </p>
<p>
     The other couple disappeared out of Estee's doorway and headed down toward the spare room, leaving Rio and Agatha standing at the side of the bed, holding hands.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know, it's really cute," Estee commented, drawing curious looks from both older women.
    </p>
<p>
     "You guys are always touching. If you're not holding hands, you're leaning into each other, or pressing your knees against one another," Tay spoke up, and there was this flash of identification in Rio's eyes. This was clearly not a pre-planned conversation, but they were both apparently of the same mind. "It's seriously so adorable."
    </p>
<p>
     The embarrassed heat on Rio was immediate, but Agatha remained composed and cool, despite the warmth of the light in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well," Rio countered, raising brow. "There's been maybe three minutes in the entirety of the time you two have been in the same room that you haven't been sat like that," she offered with an indicative flourish of her hand. "So, hi pots, I'm kettle."
    </p>
<p>
     Again, the chorus of laughter was literally like the psalms of angels, echoing around them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Get some rest, baby girls. We'll be back in the morning."
    </p>
<p>
     "Goodnight, ladies. Sleep well," Agatha added, waggling her fingers at them in a playful wave of parting.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, as the pair of them exited, Agatha had apparently had the foresight to order them a ride back to where they needed to go. It wasn't a long ride, but Rio was quiet in her reflection on the last couple of days. It really had been a rollercoaster, seemingly endless ups and down, but now they were sitting at the top, taking in the landscape of their lives from the view.
    </p>
<p>
     As they strode into the lobby, Rio's mind was a little too occupied by the idea of climbing into that big bed to pay attention to other occupants of the lobby, like the young man that was in the process of checking in. While she had missed him? Agatha hadn't.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had continued her stroll but was suddenly jerked backwards as Agatha planted her feet, stopping immediately in place. Rio looked back, following where Agatha was staring, her gaze on the back of the man at the desk. There were slides on his feet and khaki cargo shorts on his legs. A short-sleeved button up with small planets on it was around his torso, and that wild messy tangle of a bun atop his head?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked, saturated in complete shock and disbelief.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky?" Agatha's uncertain voice came, strangled with its question.
    </p>
<p>
     The young man turned around, an immediate grin on his lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi, mom."

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
<i>
      What the hell was Nicholas Scratch doing in New Zealand?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio kept blinking, kept trying to verify somehow that she was not hallucinating, even despite the fact that Agatha was standing right next to her, clutching her hand. Nicky was really standing there, that big and stupid grin on his face, looking like he was not an inch out of place standing in that hotel lobby.
    </p>
<p>
     By the way his face softened, but the smirk remained, Rio could tell that he was quite enjoying having stunned the two women to complete silence.
    </p>
<p>
     After another beat, Agatha's death grip on her hand released and she pushed forward, pulling her son tightly into her arms, pressing her face into his shoulder. Rio saw it, even though the motion didn't duplicate itself again, not once; it was the gentle tremble of Agatha's body as she exhaled a silent sob.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio had been blissfully unaware of was that almost every single time (which, honestly, wasn't quite that frequent) Agatha had picked up her phone, it had been to update Nicky, to let him know that she was out of the country, that she was tending to an emergency with Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     What Agatha had not expected when she casually made mention to him of the hotel they were staying at, was that he would show up in support.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha recognized it for what it was, but Rio still felt a bit baffled, like she was trying to put a puzzle together when half of the pieces had been knocked off of the table. She was missing things, here. Sure, they were things that she would have likely been told by Agatha when they had retired to their room for the night, but for Rio? She didn't understand it, if support was what was happening.
    </p>
<p>
     They had not gotten off on the best foot, and even though he had tried valiantly to prove that he was trying to engage more, Rio had still been wary of him, for her own reasons.
    </p>
<p>
     None of those reasons seemed to matter in that moment. Her heart was swelling at the sight, just watching Agatha cling to her son in a display of emotion so public, and yet, Agatha did not care.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled away from him, her hands sliding to cup his cheeks in her palms, just staring at him in wonder.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Thank you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She leaned forward, placing a soft kiss to his cheek and then let him go all the way so that she could turn back to Rio, who had edged a little closer, but not close enough to intrude on what felt to her like a very meaningful moment. What Rio did not understand was that it was meaningful for her, too, she just didn't realize it yet.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi, Nicky," she offered with a small wave, though it had to be obvious that she was exhausted. "What... what are you doing here?"
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky's face softened and he glanced down at his luggage for a minute, then back up to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom texted me when you landed and told me what was going on. She's... been keeping me updated. But... I couldn't go to bed after we talked. So, I booked a flight and got on a plane, and here I am, twenty hours later."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could see it, the exhaustion in those bright green eyes. He had really done this for them. He had come all this way so that he could be there to help, to support. He had come to make things easier not only for his mother, but for the woman she loved, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt it, a slow crawl. It started in her stomach, clawing its way with no rush up to her chest. The quickening of her pulse began to thud a little harder in her neck as her chest tightened. She could feel the tears welling, could feel as her hands began to tremble. Before she could reach the point of feeling like she couldn't breathe, she blinked back the glassiness and cleared her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     "Excuse me," she pardoned herself, not giving room for protest as she turned on her heel and disappeared toward the elevators.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio, wait --!" Nicky called, starting to move forward, but Agatha placed a gentle hand on his arm, holding him in place. She shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
     He looked up at her, feeling like he was in the wrong, that helpless pit in his gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's not you," Agatha told him softly. "She... has been alone for a very long time. I think that... she's just not used to people showing up for her."
    </p>
<p>
     "I... Mom, I didn't know," he offered in a gentle murmur, almost ashamed in its tone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned toward him, pressing her lips to his forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know, baby. Why don't you head up to your room and get settled. You definitely need some sleep after that, you insane child of mine."
    </p>
<p>
     The smile he wore as he tilted his head up at Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     She was so lucky to have him as a son, no matter what they had been through.
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The sounds of Rio's labored breathing bounced off the walls of the elevator like a deep chamber, endless in their anguish. Her heart was pounding so hard that she could hear nothing else, her palms were sweating and she could hardly think about each step she took as she shot down the hallway.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands were shaking so badly that it took her far too long to get the key into the door, and that she dropped it the moment she pushed the door open, leaving it half hanging out into the hall once the door closed.
    </p>
<p>
     She pushed off the door and staggered to the bathroom, throwing the cold faucets on and turning on the overhead in the shower. She managed to kick off her shoes, but otherwise threw herself into the shower, fully clothed. Her knees were pulled, hugged to her chest and her face pressed into them as the chillingly cold water fell over her.
    </p>
<p>
     She was still heaving, still unable to still a single thought that was racing around her mind at break-neck speeds.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had shown up for her. Nicky had decided to get on a plane for almost an entire day so that he could be there for
     <i>
      her.
     </i>
     She knew that it was because of Agatha's feelings for her, but he had still made that very adult choice. He had booked his own flight, packed his own luggage, and put himself on that plane.
    </p>
<p>
     He had chosen to stay in the same hotel they were, to be close to them.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky chose them.
    </p>
<p>
     The thought made her sob harder, squeezing her legs closer to her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     People did not choose Rio. Estee and Tay? They were her family, they would always choose her. Anyone else? Anyone else would never choose Rio, because Rio had never been a noticeable choice. She had always kept to herself, tucked herself away in her own little corner of the world because she had convinced herself that people just weren't worth the risk. They weren't worth pain.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of the shower mixed with the soft sound of her sobs in the middle of her panic attack were loud enough to drown out what was happening on the other side of that hotel room door.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha approached it, giving it a soft tap to announce that she had arrived so Rio could come let her in, as she had been in possession of the only key they had.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sweetheart," Agatha called softly, but there was no response. There was no sound of movement.
    </p>
<p>
     Concerned, Agatha's brow pinched and she knocked a little harder.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio," she voiced, raising the volume a bit.
    </p>
<p>
     "Baby, let me in," she requested, even a little louder.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, in the quiet of the hallway, she barely heard it. It sounded like a sob.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft sigh fell from Agatha's lips as her eyes slid shut and she pressed her forehead to the door. She didn't know what was happening, but she did know that the woman she loved was on the other side of that door, hurting, and she couldn't get to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes opened and she saw it -- the keycard.
    </p>
<p>
     In one quick motion, she dipped and swiped it up, jamming it into the door to let herself in. She caught her hip on the handle of the door -- sure to bruise -- as she pushed inside, wildly searching the room for Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't see her, but she heard something. The shower was running.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned, bolting for the bathroom to take in the view of the frosted glass door, shut but still opaque enough to show the silhouette of Rio, curled up on the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had officially come to absolutely loathe seeing Rio in pain. She was such a bright soul, bringing life with her everywhere she went. She could bring blooms out of any situation, watering and nurturing anything in her path that needed it. So to know that she could feel like this? It broke something in Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, she paced forward, reaching forward to push the door open. She looked down, the sight nearly tearing her down from the ground up.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still hugging her knees, her body unsteady both in the rapid rate at which she was breathing and in the way she was physically just... trembling.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took all of two seconds to decide what she was going to do.
    </p>
<p>
     She, too, kicked off her flats and stepped inside the large shower. She pulled the door shut, the water damn near freezing as it hit her skin. She hesitated a moment and reached over, turning the handle so that the water shifted to a slightly warmer temperature, though not by much. Her hand dropped and her next movements were automatic.
    </p>
<p>
     Without a single drop of hesitance in her entire being, Agatha moved behind Rio and lowered herself to the floor of the shower, sitting so that she could place herself flush against Rio's back, legs on either side of her hips.
    </p>
<p>
     So gently, Agatha reached around her, the gentle grip sinking into the wet flesh of Rio's arm. Rio cried harder, nearly gasping for breath. With a soft tug, Agatha somehow silently coaxed her to let go of her knees, which she then helped ease to a flat position.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio heaved, her chest rapidly filling and deflating, so unable to catch her breath. It had been panic, at first, but it had unreasonably escalated to terror.
    </p>
<p>
     At what?
    </p>
<p>
     What was she scared of?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      That eventually, they would leave.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could feel it everywhere and nowhere as Agatha's hands found her shoulders and slowly, in sync with one another, slid down Rios arms, all the way until their hands were flush, Agatha's palms pressed to the backs of Rio's hands.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Focus on your fingertips. Focus hard enough that you can actually feel them,"
     </i>
     Agatha whispered into her ear, her own touch lifting so that the only thing she was touching was the tips of Rio's fingers on each hand.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Now move that focus, like a warmth. Move it into your palms,"
     </i>
     she instructed, her voice still low as her fingertips traced the lightest lines down the backs of her fingers, stopping as they reached the center most part of the back of her hand.
     <i>
      "Now, to your wrists,"
     </i>
     she guided, those light fingertips following her own direction.
     <i>
      "And then alllllll the way up to your elbow,"
     </i>
     she breathed, continuing her path across Rio's skin, leaving Rio with a newfound ability to focus on something else than the biting panic in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "To your shoulders, then sternum."
     </i>
     Agatha's touch was so light, so gentle, so full of affection.
     <i>
      "Now, this way,"
     </i>
     and the tips of her fingers began to drift up the center of Rio's throat, causing her to tilt her head back.
     <i>
      "Now just push it out,"
     </i>
     she instructed, and Rio's lips parted, a soft sigh escaping them.
    </p>
<p>
     Her breathing had slowed quite a bit and the pounding in her chest had evened out enough that she didn't feel like her ribs were going to break at any given moment.
    </p>
<p>
     As she seemed to find herself in the moment, she blinked, but then felt as Agatha's arms tightened around her middle, holding her close.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I've got you. I'm right here,"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured loud enough to be heard over the still running stream of the shower.
    </p>
<p>
     They sat like that for a few more moments before Rio seemed to relax. Agatha lifted her head from where it was resting against Rio's shoulder and gave her another gentle squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Do you want to shower, or should we just dry off?"
     </i>
     Agatha softly posed in gentle curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sniffled, wiping at her nose.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Can we just... dry off and get into bed?"
     </i>
     she asked in a small voice. Agatha hugged her tighter.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, my love," she voiced, her tone a little stronger, a little louder. Slowly, she released the hold she had around Rio and got to her feet, shutting the water off. She held her hand down in offering, thankful when Rio took hold and got to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     With the most tender form of care she could muster, Rio could feel as Agatha poured herself into the act of getting her out of her wet clothes. Each movement was slow, deliberate, careful. Rio felt, in that moment, like she was going to dissolve into tears all over again, but she somehow fought to keep it together.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha reached up to take her own shirt, Rio reached down, helping her unbutton and unzip the jeans she had been wearing, which she shucked a moment later. Agatha handed her a towel, which Rio thanked her for softly as she accepted.
    </p>
<p>
     As they stood there, toweling off to be dry enough to get into bed, Rio couldn't help herself as she found herself watching Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Carefree, dedicated, vivacious, manicured Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Her Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     With soft, cautious footsteps, she crossed the tile, dropping her own towel to the floor as she just kept walking, straight into Agatha. Her arms wound tight around the other woman, holding her close as Rio pressed her face into the skin of her sternum, taking in a slow and deep breath.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's arms were back around her in an instant, a bare and vulnerable moment of raw desperation that was locked behind that hotel room door, for only them to know about, for only them to hold onto.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Why don't we go lay down?"
     </i>
     Agatha posed softly, the smallest little quirk of her lips that seemed borne out of hope.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a gentle nod and let Agatha lead her back to the bed, which they both slid easily into, bare skin on bare skin. This time, though, they were on the side of the bed that usually belonged to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The way they had landed, Rio's body was face down, half overlapping Agatha's her face nestled into the crook of Agatha's neck. She could feel every single sensation at once as Agatha's fingertips traced light lines up and down the path of her spine, a mindless repetition of established contact, a reminder of her presence, steady and unwavering.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Do you... want to talk about it?"
     </i>
     Agatha extended the quiet offer as though if she asked any louder, it might completely shatter the opportunity.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still and quiet for a long few moments, so still and quiet that Agatha had considered for a moment that she had fallen asleep, but then a soft whisper found Agatha's ear, so soft that the only reason it reached its destination was because of its proximity from the way they were laying.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Having people show up for me that I know I will have to watch walk away... It... I..."
     </i>
     she was floundering, completely unable to find her words.
    </p>
<p>
     The pressure of Agatha's touch grew a bit more, felt a little more present. It was a soft encouragement that she could take her time and also say what she needed to say.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I panicked. I was still... so wary of him because of my own personal bias... and he flew almost an entire day to show up for
      <b>
       me.
      </b>
      "
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's head turned slightly, but only so that she could press her lips to Rio's hairline.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "For what it's worth, I honestly had no idea. I just... told him about what happened, that we had to come here to be with Estee. He asked what he could do and I told him that there really wasn't anything he
      <b>
       could
      </b>
      do. Guess that stubborn streak I passed down to him proved me wrong."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sniffled softly against Agatha's skin, a couple of tears leaking from the corners of her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You have support, now. I know it's something you're not used to, but it's not going away, Rio. You are so very loved, and so are your girls."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The smallest movement, Rio's face turning further into Agatha's skin, breathing her in, getting lost in nothing but the smell of her bare skin. It was soothing, it made it all better. It made her remember that this was real, that she was laying in a bed, in a hotel room, in her home country, listening to the heartbeat of the woman she loved most in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Never would she have imagined that her life would reach such great heights and yet, such steep lows all so concurrently. How was it that so much could happen at one time? How was it that she could be stretched so thin that she thought the next emotional moment might snap her, but she somehow still absorbed the shock each time?
    </p>
<p>
     Because there, working around the clock to create any slack she could manage, was Agatha, so good with her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had never needed to be
     <i>
      fixed.
     </i>
     What Rio needed was for someone else's perspective to simply
     <i>
      adjust
     </i>
     her, and her place in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     It had not taken much longer, between the silence that laid over them like a warm duvet and the feel of Agatha's touch on her back, for Rio to slip into a hard, deep sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     So hard and deep that when she woke up the next morning, she was immediately confused when she woke up cold. She forced her eyes open into the dim light of the morning; it couldn't have been much past sunrise. She was substantially closer to her edge of the bed than she had been when she had fallen asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     With some effort, she shifted so that she could turn her head to look back across the other side of the bed. There, about four inches away, was Agatha in every bit of her nude and slumbering majesty, facing away from Rio on her stomach with her right leg hiked up.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just watched her for a long few moments, just studying the even rise and fall of her chest with the unencumbered weightlessness of sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been silent for minutes, the veneration sitting heavy in her chest as she beheld this... masterpiece of a human being.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, another ten minutes passed.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio shifted, careful to keep her weight even as she did so as to not wake up Agatha. Not yet.
    </p>
<p>
     They were closer, but Rio was on her side, roughly an inch of space between her front and Agatha's arm.
    </p>
<p>
     With measured speed, Rio raised a hand, tucking her ring and pinky fingers to her palm. She used the remaining two fingers to reach forward, so gently tracing out the curve of Agatha's shoulder blade, feeling it out in its slight protrusion. The touch danced, sliding up higher, gracing over the center of her shoulders, up to her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft breath left Agatha's lungs, but Rio did not desist in her actions.
    </p>
<p>
     She used that feather of a touch to feel out every inch of skin she could reach on Agatha's back, mapping her out. Every freckle, a landmark. Every curve of her ribs, a jetty into the ocean of who she was.
    </p>
<p>
     In a stir of movement that Rio had not been expecting, Agatha lifted her head and moved just enough so that she could turn it the other way, otherwise not shifting much.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Whaddyadoin?"
     </i>
     came a gentle murmur that was almost husky but was slightly overshadowed by how curious it was.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's answer was instant and beautiful in its simplicity.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Worshipping you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There was a gentle wave of emotion that washed through Agatha's eyes and her lips pressed together a bit more.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "But I was sleeping. Shouldn't I be awake for that kind of thing?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was quiet for a long few moments, staring at her hand on Agatha's back before she lifted her gaze.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Sometimes, it's easier to find faith in the quieter moments."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That look on Agatha's face was emotional, but naming exactly what it was felt impossible. She spent all of three seconds trying to figure it out, but Agatha's voice pulled her, with forced, back down to earth.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Kiss me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Maybe such a request would have made Rio grin, in the context of any other moment, but in that one? She had felt it the moment Agatha turned over. There was something different about that moment, something that had a force of gravity that they had not yet experienced, not in the minutia of it all.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio obliged, scooting closer, their skin touching in all the places their bodies overlapped as she got close enough to do as she was told.
    </p>
<p>
     Their lips brushed, so, so softly at first. It was like a caress, a gentle wave of affection. Then, Rio pressed. It was warmer, but still undemanding in its insistence. As their lips tenderly began to fold over one another, Rio's hand had reinstated its journey through the peaks and valleys of Agatha's back. It was mindless in its exploration, but she could tell that as they kissed and Agatha's breath grew a little heavier?
    </p>
<p>
     The kiss deepened, a gentle show of the way their tongues moved in harmony more than they struggled to assert dominance. Agatha had never moved much else, still face down with her arms pinned either beneath herself or against Rio's front, completely at the mercy of Rio's lips on hers, of Rio's hand on her body.
    </p>
<p>
     It wore on just a little longer before Rio managed to convince herself to pull away, a soft huff of disappointment sounding from low in Agatha's throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did not leave her wanting, though. She pushed herself up enough so that she could swing her leg over both of Agatha's thighs that were pressed together, scooting up a little higher, the bottom section of Agatha's hips between her knees. She leaned forward, intent on making sure that there was no other contact on Agatha's skin other than the soft kiss she placed at the base of her skull.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took her time, pressing her lips to each inch of Agatha's spine, lingering a few seconds each time she did so. She had done this once before, in a much more frenzied state, but she took a lot more care this run. She was deliberate in her pace, in her length of contact. She carved that path down the very center of Agatha's spine over the course of about ten minutes. As she reached the curve of her ass, she straightened back up. Her hand dipped, fingers tucking under the hook of Agatha's hipbone, giving a gentle tug. It was a wordless request for her to roll over.
    </p>
<p>
     As the realization settled, Agatha understood and did as she was instructed, flipping carefully to her back between Rio's legs as she held herself up above her.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha settled back into the bed, Rio settled back onto her legs.
    </p>
<p>
     Again, she leaned over, but this time, she met her mark of Agatha's lips, a loving exchange of skin on skin. The kiss didn't last, though, as Rio parted to place a kiss on Agatha's chin.
    </p>
<p>
     With the same careful skill and attention to every single detail, she repeated the process on the front side of Agatha's body. Every kiss intentional. She was careful, again, to keep her hands away, leaving the only contact on Agatha's skin to be with her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     The lower she kissed, the more she scooted back to allow herself the room. She kissed the place just above Agatha's navel. After a breath, she jumped to the lower side of it, placing another kiss. And another.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes lifted beneath her brow and she had honestly been expecting to be met at eye-level with that heart-stopping blue stare, but what she saw instead?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head was tilted to the side, both of her hands shoved under the pillow beneath her head. The look on her face?
     <i>
      That look?
     </i>
     It turned Rio's core molten hot, but in the most tender way possible. Agatha was in a complete an entire state of surrender.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was pouring her love into her one kiss, one action at a time, and Agatha was letting her.
    </p>
<p>
     She placed one more kiss, just above where her pubic bone sat and lifted herself back up, moving slightly so that she could gently reposition Agatha's legs how she needed them.
    </p>
<p>
     As she nestled back onto the bed on her stomach, her eyes flickered up, that same look still on her face, but her chest rising and falling with a deeper sense of anticipation.
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed forward, her mouth finding Agatha's core, hot and wet.
    </p>
<p>
     The reaction was delayed, but she felt every muscle of it: Agatha had started to grab for Rio's head, but she had caught herself, keeping her hands tucked under the pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha understood it. She saw what Rio was doing and appreciated every single bit of thought and feeling she was pouring into it.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd had sex. They'd even fucked a few times.
    </p>
<p>
     What this was, it fell beyond those parameters in every way imaginable. This was a pure and full display of every bit of feeling, every emotion, every ounce of love that Rio had in her. She was dumping it, full stop, into Agatha without a second thought.
    </p>
<p>
     She was unhurried in her movements, though that deliberateness never once waned. The longer she worked, the longer her tongue made every single gentle pass over every inch of Agatha that she could taste, she could feel as the waves of goosebumps would come and go. She could feel as Agatha would start to tense and Rio's attention would shift the slightest bit in a different direction.
    </p>
<p>
     After a few more moments, she gently repositioned so that she could not only resume her work, but so that she could gently push two fingers inside of Agatha to assist her.
    </p>
<p>
     The care Rio took in how she handled Agatha's body was astounding. She was so thoughtful, so precise in the way she treated her body like it were a temple. Rio wanted her to feel it, to feel every place that she could reach, every place that she could touch her.
    </p>
<p>
     Like a sixth sense, Rio knew it was coming before it actually happened. It was in the way that Agatha's breath hitched -- not once, but twice -- in the matter of a few seconds, and the muscles in her thighs tensed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was fully aware of the body-tensing, muscle binding reaction that Agatha had to every single orgasm she had, but as she curled her fingers up and felt Agatha's entire body pull taut? Rio didn't move, unwavering in her position as Agatha's thighs pulled shut, squeezing the sides of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     She stilled the movement of her tongue and did somehow manage to pull her hand back, only due to the space afforded by the gap caused by the presence of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Seconds passed and Rio could feel acutely as every single muscle in Agatha's thighs began to unlock and untense. After another moment, she seemed to relax back into the bed, though she was still trembling beneath Rio's touch.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes blinked up at the ceiling as if she were trying to remember what it meant to think coherently, her fingers tracing mindless lines on her own chest before she seemed to find herself again, her eyes lifting down to Rio, who hoisted herself to her hands and knees. She lifted her head, their eyes meeting.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come here, you,"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured, the pleasure still thick over her words.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio obliged, crawling over her to lay the entirety of her weight against her, nuzzling her face into the warmth and slight dampness of Agatha's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's fingers picked up their familiar pacing across Rio's spine, a low hum sounding from her throat.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I... I've fucked a lot of people,"
     </i>
     Agatha admitted, which Rio was already aware, but she sensed that Agatha was bringing it up for a reason.
     <i>
      "But
      <b>
       no one
      </b>
      has ever made love to me like that."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's head lifted, her face moving to hover above Agatha's by an inch or two.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hm,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed in a soft musing.
     <i>
      "I suppose, then, that you might stick around for more?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's gaze wavered slightly, but she swallowed it down.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I suppose I just might."
     </i>

       Two hearts folding.

       Pulling everything.

<p>

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     There could have been a million thoughts racing, fighting for first place, inside of Rio's head, but the only thing, with a steady rhythm, that rang around in her mind?
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of Agatha's breathing as it slowed and then found a steady pace, a gentle rising and falling as her heart slowed and she felt her toes touch the surface of the earth again, the high she was riding finally drawing to a close.
    </p>
<p>
     This closeness, this sense of being so on the verge of just disappearing into everything that Agatha was? Rio couldn't seem to get enough of it. This incredible woman had somehow managed the inevitable; Rio had sworn she wouldn't let herself get that far, but right then? With their bodies a blend of skin and sighs, a quiet sense of peace surrounding them, Rio knew that as long as she was with Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     She was home.
    </p>
<p>
     After a few minutes, Agatha seemed to have regained her composure, both of her hands giving Rio's hips a playful squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio lifted her head, gaze sweeping down to admire the woman below her?
    </p>
<p>
     There was the smallest flicker of a flame in her eyes, but there was something more, something bigger written on Agatha's face. It was this beautiful blend of the ache of hunger and the need for closeness from someone she felt so connected to in literally every way.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand reached up, her palm curving to fit around the angle of Rio's jaw as she began to guide her down, pressing their lips together in the most affectionate liplock she could manage.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was good at fucking; that emotionless foray into physically pushing boundaries and having a disregard for one's own wellbeing. It had been easy to emotionally separate herself from the physical in every way, especially once she finally let herself admit that her marriage had been a sham since its inception, and Nicky was literally the one good thing to have ever come from it.
    </p>
<p>
     Mindless sex? Easy.
    </p>
<p>
     Finding some possible way to communicate that she wanted to crawl into Rio's chest and wrap around her heart?
    </p>
<p>
     That was about as likely as catching a comet.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio pulled back to look down at Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha found them, the right words, coming to quickly to the front of her mind without her having to search for them.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Let me see you,"
     </i>
     she posed, her tone rich in its request.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment the words hit her ears, something in Rio first softened, and then, as she looked at Agatha --
     <i>
      really looked at her
     </i>
     -- that vivid memory from the first night they had been intimate came flooding back.
    </p>
<p>
     This request ran a little deeper, held a little more of an emotional weight to it. Rio just watched her, studying every little micro expression that might happen to break through, but Agatha remained steadfast in her honest request. A hand raised, a couple of fingers giving a light tap to her hip in quiet encouragement.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze was unrelenting, trying to do it back, trying to look right into Agatha the same way Agatha was so constantly peering into her soul.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, there it was. It was the gentlest flaring of her nostrils, the way her eyes seemed to develop a shine of emotion in them.
    </p>
<p>
     It was...
     <i>
      fear?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio reached up, a caution in her movements that kept her slow. With a willing of the most gentle sense of pure love, the tips of her fingers brushed over Agatha's lips, her touch tentative.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did not move, did not breathe, just stared into the eyes of the woman she loved.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What scares you, Agatha Harkness?"
     </i>
     Rio crooned softly, shifting her hand to curl her fingers inward so that they could rest against the line of her jaw, her thumb replacing her fingers in terms of sustaining the contact on Agatha's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     It was almost thundering, between Rio's ears, and yet, Agatha had not moved her lips beneath Rio's loving caress.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha voiced the thought at the exact same time that Rio voiced the echo, their combined sentiment harmonizing in the warmth of the morning.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "A reality where this isn't an option."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Every bit of air? Completely vacuumed from the room. It was seized, leaving the two of them staring at one another, wide-eyed.
    </p>
<p>
     It might have been funny, but in that moment? Rio could have literally ripped out of there, made a beeline for the nearest jeweler, thrown any amount of money at them, marched out with a ring and right back up to Agatha, not even asking because she already knew the answer. It had been a total of two weeks and one day that they had spent together, and Rio knew that Agatha was everything she could ever want or need in another human being.
    </p>
<p>
     She was comforting, she was caring, affectionate. She was fiercely protective of those close to her, and she had no reserves in being
     <i>
      that bitch
     </i>
     when something needed to be accomplished. She had shown Rio time and time again that she would move mountains for her, and how else was there to feel about someone who acted that way? Rio knew that she'd chosen solitude, but right then? She couldn't imagine choosing anything other than Agatha, and the idea of what a life with her might look like.
    </p>
<p>
     Their eyes stayed locked, the intensity of the moment between them, and what had just happened seeming to stay right there, nestled between them like a boulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Both of Agatha's hands were raising in a flurry of a motion, pulling Rio's jaw into her grasp as she leaned up to meet her, melting into the contact that their lips had to offer. Despite her urgency to grab her, Agatha's normally voracious hunger had been replaced with something softer, something less demanding. Instead, it was a nearly begging request for nourishment, a watering of parts of her she had almost forgotten about it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could read it, easier than she could read a line of code. She could read it, easier than any line in any book she'd ever opened in her lap. Agatha was a multitude, containing every fact Rio needed to know about the universe. Her answers were Rio's scripture, restoring what faith she had lost in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her back, that same unassuming nature coursing through them, an ebb and flow of this silently compassionate respect to what was hanging there over them.
    </p>
<p>
     It was an understanding that although they could call it love, they could assert that word as if it were the be-all-end-all?
    </p>
<p>
     This wasn't love.
    </p>
<p>
     This was what happened when stars came into existence.
    </p>
<p>
     This was that hot white flash before a new hope appeared in the sky.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head sank back into the pillow in a weak attempt to separate their lips, though it seemed effective enough as she opened her eyes into Rio's.
    </p>
<p>
     For the first time, they
     <i>
      saw each other. Really, truly saw each other.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     They both seemed to be hoarding a breath, but as Agatha once again reached for her face, this time her knuckles brushing over Rio's cheek, they seemed to exhale in unison.
    </p>
<p>
     How could this be real? How could this be possible, even? How could they lay there like that and be so in tune that they could just... damn near be the same person? It was insane, wasn't it?
    </p>
<p>
     But wasn't that what Rio had been insisting about this the entire time?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's voice came soft, her words pleading even more this time.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Let me see you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze softened, her eyes almost giving into the threat of truly and emotionally moved tears, but she heeded the request, but only after stealing one more timed but intimate kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     She shifted, moving back to where she had started, but without prompting, she moved, settling on Agatha's abdomen just beneath her breasts.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd been here before, but they hadn't. It was familiar, yet so impossibly different.
    </p>
<p>
     Before, Agatha had looked starved, like she could have torn into Rio for days and never got her fill. She had looked ravenous, completely mad with the feeling of want and lust.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio saw in that moment?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression was soft, those eyes still hungry, but there was something else there, something Rio took only a moment to place.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a reverential possessiveness, protectiveness mixed with an unyieldingly dire need for literally
     <i>
      every single thing
     </i>
     that Rio was, and could ever be.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands had settled on Rio's thighs for only a moment before they began to move, an exploratory pressure at first, but in only a moment, it lifted to the grazing of the tips of her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's touch skated so lightly up Rio's sides, back down over her hips. Passing the threshold to her thighs, that pressure deepened, fingernails lightly digging into skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes slid shut at the contact, licking her lips as a soft sigh escaped her.
    </p>
<p>
     She had accomplished what she had set out to do in every step she took when ravishing Agatha with every bit of love she had, but if she had known what it felt like?
    </p>
<p>
     The way Agatha's hands moved with a deft understanding of Rio's anatomy, it was mind blowing. She took her time in feeling out literally every single inch of skin that was above Rio's knees, and that was only because of the way they were situated. She would oscillate between different applications of pressure, tracing some pieces of her -- like toward her hips and around her breasts --  and pressing others, even sometimes asserting a grip in a moment when she felt especially desperate.
    </p>
<p>
     What had started as a slow thaw had quickly turned into Agatha completely melting every single bit of history in Rio's bones. She had spent twenty long years carrying her trauma with her, but in those seconds when Agatha could feel every last bit of what made her human?
    </p>
<p>
     She'd never wanted to be someone else's so damn bad in her entire life.
    </p>
<p>
     For the first time in what felt like forever, Rio's eyes opened into the morning light, but then dropped into Agatha's, who whispered a soft request, one so different than the last time Rio had heard it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come,"
     </i>
     Agatha whispered, reaching up to tap her chin in clear indication of what it was she was asking for.
    </p>
<p>
     A gently disbelieving huff fell from Rio's lips, but she did not give it too much hesitation before she lifted herself up and moved forward.
    </p>
<p>
     For just a flash of a second, Rio felt self-conscious, but as Agatha's hands came from behind her and hooked into her hips, gently pulling her down?
    </p>
<p>
     It was a reckoning, one that seemed to strike her in tandem with the way her core seemed to land exactly the right way in Agatha's mouth, one of her hands flying to grip at one of Agatha's that was stationed on her hip. Agatha's fingers pressed firmly into Rio's hip bones, holding her firmly where she wanted her.
    </p>
<p>
     Although Rio realized the power she had in the way they were stationed, she had already given complete control over to Agatha, at least for the time being.
    </p>
<p>
     That woman was a quick study, and she had taken their time together and had decided to use it wisely in the classes she'd chosen to take. Very clearly, the one she had excelled in had been the Anatomy Of Rio 101.
    </p>
<p>
     Every brush, every press, every flick of Agatha's tongue sent electricity coursing through every nerve in Rio's body. Keeping one hand on Agatha's, she leaned forward, hooking the other over the back of the headboard for support. She was strong, but she was only so strong, and she was quickly losing her focus in the feeling of pleasure that had started to pool in the furthest reaches of her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     The closer she got, the less able she was to keep her hands to herself. She adjusted just slightly, straightening as she removed her hand from the headboard to slide it through Agatha's hair instead.
    </p>
<p>
     Almost outside of her own cognition, her hips shifted downward, desperate for the release she knew Agatha could offer her, if she just kept doing
     <i>
      that.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's hands released their hold on Rio's hips, her arms moving to wrap around her thighs, pulling her closer. Rio could feel it all too keenly as Agatha's tongue managed to reach parts of her it hadn't quite got to before, causing a lowly warm moan to roll off of Rio's lips as her head tilted back in the ecstasy of the action.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "A-Agatha!"
     </i>
     she cried out, her voice strangled with the absolute burning desperation she felt in her very middle.
     <i>
      "I... I'm g-gonna -- oh!"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Involuntarily, Rio's hips rocked down into the pressure Agatha was providing, though her entire body tensed for just a moment before every ripple of her orgasm sent a trembling vibration through every single one of her limbs. Agatha was not stopping, and it was just causing those shots of lighting to shoot up her spine, striking her in the stem of her brain.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Ag-Agatha, Agatha, st-st-- oh! Oh, gods!"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In an overwhelmed rush, Rio's hand found Agatha's forehead, applying the lightest pressure as she tried to also remove herself, but failed miserably due to the way her legs were positively shaking.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to understand and replaced her hands back on Rio's hips, using the contact to gently guide her back to sit on her chest while she rode out each wave as it rolled in.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's chest was heaving as she sat there, hardly able to catch her breath enough to still the swirling of expletives that were on a constant loop in her brain. After a few brief moments, she finally commanded her gaze down, her eyes meeting Agatha's in a loving basking of affection.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Kiss me,"
     </i>
     she beguiled again, and Rio was immediate in her response.
    </p>
<p>
     She removed herself from the straddling position across Agatha's chest and instead moved to place her weight back atop her, like some sort of anxiety blanket, weighing on her, sinking into her.
    </p>
<p>
     One of Rio's hands slid easily into Agatha's hair as she leaned down, pressing their lips together. It was funny, Rio, thought, how she could taste them. Agatha had been on the tip of her tongue, and they had exchanged the favor, leaving that kiss distinctly different, something that was so far beyond intimate that it was incomprehensible by the human mind.
    </p>
<p>
     That kiss, not quite deep enough to drown in, but just deep enough to keep them from touching the bottom, lingered on for several long moments until --
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's phone began to ring on her nightstand, causing her to exhale a low whine into Rio's mouth before she separated their lips.
    </p>
<p>
     With the softest giggle, Rio rolled off to Agatha's side, unpinning her so that she could lean over to grab her phone, swiping it as she lifted it to her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, Nicky," she managed, trying to act like she wasn't still fighting for air.
    </p>
<p>
     She was quiet for a moment, a soft fondness crossing her features. "I mean... I can ask her, and she can find out. But... I'm almost certain it won't be a problem, if you really want to."
    </p>
<p>
     Another pause.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course. Let me talk with her and I'll text you with the plan, okay?" A gentle smile curled Agatha's lips at Nicky's response.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you too, baby boy."
    </p>
<p>
     She hung up the phone, dropping it in her hand down to the bed as she turned her head to take in the sight next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     There, Rio was laying on her side, her head propped up on her fist, elbow for support. There was still a warm blush on her skin from their previous efforts, but the smile she was wearing said she almost knew what was coming, but she gave a gentle tip of her head as if to open the floor to let Agatha speak.
    </p>
<p>
     "He wants to know if he could come with us today when we go visit Estee and Tay. He said that he'd really like to meet them."
    </p>
<p>
     The smile on Rio's face fell, but only because of the sincerity of the request being posed to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, so maybe Rio had definitely misjudged Nicky. She could see his attempt for what it was; he was embracing his mother's hope that this would be something for longer than just a couple of days. He was making every attempt he could to embrace that this could be a large part of his life moving forward.
    </p>
<p>
     In a way, he was acknowledging that he had not exactly meant what he had said to Agatha that night on the patio, when he had looked her in the eye and told her he'd show no respect to anyone she bought around.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, how the tides had changed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't have to blink for the few tears to spill down her cheeks. She gave a small, almost imperceptible nod, but it was more to keep her from delving into just how deeply touched she was by the sentiment.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think they would really like to meet him, too, but I will shoot Estee a text just to make sure."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's smile was instant in its warmth as she leaned forward, pressing her lips to Rio's forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     "You text her and then when you're done, come wash up with me," she requested in a soft breath against Rio's skin before she pulled away and swung her legs over the edge of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     As was becoming all too commonplace, Rio watched as Agatha's naked form disappeared into the bathroom of a hotel room before she snapped her attention back down to her phone, quickly punching in the question, sending it to Estee.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Agatha's son flew in last night. He asked if it would be okay if he accompanied us to visit you today because he'd really like to meet you both. Would that be alright with you two?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It only took a moment before the little dotted bubble popped up, indicating she was forming her response, which came a second later.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      That was sweet of him. We would like to meet him too. Bring him with you. And snacks. We would really appreciate all of the snacks. Te amo, mama! See you soon!
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's smile was instant as was her reply.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Te veo, mija.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She dropped the phone on the bed, lifting her head as she marched into that bathroom to dive right into that shower with her girlfriend.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Girlfriend.
     </i>
     Hm.
     <i>
      There had to be a better word than that.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     They were getting pretty good at mastering the art of a purposeful but quick shower, and somehow, the act never lost its intimacy. No matter how many times they engaged in the simple act of cleaning one another, it never lost its ability to make her feel so impossibly fucking close to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     They had finished up, toweled off and got ready for the day after Agatha had texted Nicky to let him know to do the same. They had all convened in the lobby of the hotel, loading into the back of the SUV Agatha had ordered. They'd made a stop at the market, picking up various snacks for the girls. Nicky had departed, though, with his own basket.
    </p>
<p>
     As she and Agatha were paying, he slid up in line behind them, his basket now decently packed. Rio's eyes dropped in curiosity, making note of the two bottles of wine he'd grabbed, but a few other items caught her attention. Something in her chest squeezed, her eyes lifting to his, narrowing slightly in question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you get the things to make arroz con pollo?" Rio asked him, her voice impossibly soft, touched by the sentiment of the gesture.
    </p>
<p>
     When he nodded, she gripped tightly at Agatha's hand in her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, fine. He was completely and entirely forgiven for the way he had showed his ass.
    </p>
<p>
     They finished paying and waited for him to check out before they returned back to the car, loading their things into the trunk before filing back into the vehicle.
    </p>
<p>
     It was only about a ten minute drive from the market to the girls' apartment and the way it was filled with Nicky asking general questions about things he thought he should know before he met them? Rio hardly knew what to do with that emotion, both new and unidentifiable for the time being.
    </p>
<p>
     As they unloaded and went to grab the bags, Nicky was insistent he could get everything and encouraged the two of them to lead the way. Rio pulled out the key to the apartment and let them in, not entirely sure if Tay's parents were still there. She realized, though, at the lack of some of the things they had seen the night before, they had probably left earlier that morning.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's us, mija! Do you need me to bring you back anything?"
    </p>
<p>
     She heard Estee's response immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     "Snacks! Just bring all of the snacks!" she chirped, followed by the blending of giggles between the two girls in the bedroom. Rio stepped forward, Agatha in step, as she reached over her shoulder to wave Nicky forward.
    </p>
<p>
     They slid into the room, both girls propped up side by side against the headboard, their hands wrapped around one another in the little dip of space created by their thighs being pressed together. They lifted their gazes, following on the new arrivals.
    </p>
<p>
     "Girls, this is Nicky, Agatha's son," she introduced, but was quick to follow up. "Nicky, that's Estee, my daughter," she offered, needlessly indicating the miniature version of herself. "And that's her girlfriend, my adopted daughter, Taylah."
    </p>
<p>
     "It's really nice to meet you both," he offered brightly, light dancing in those beautiful green eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you for coming all the way here for us. But I promise, you'll realize very quickly we are not worth
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     much effort," Estee informed him with a soft laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio clicked her tongue -- in a move that felt like she had co-opted from the Agatha Harkness playbook -- in admonishment at her daughter. "Ay, mija, don't do that. You really don't want me to lecture you on just how important you are in front of
     <i>
      everyone,
     </i>
     do you?" she prodded, though the teasing in her tone was evident.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee rolled her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, most of this is for you," Nicky voiced, stepping forward to hand over the bags that had contained their requests, causing both girls to squeal in delight as they rummaged through the haul.
    </p>
<p>
     His attention turned to Rio, his head dipping toward the remaining bags in his hand. "Can I put this stuff away in the kitchen for later?" he asked her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, do you need me to show you where it is?"
    </p>
<p>
     He shook his head gently. "Thank you, but I saw it when we came in. I'll be right back."
    </p>
<p>
     Almost absent-mindedly, he raised a hand to give Rio's arm a light pat and disappeared out of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, he's leaving already?" Estee asked, her lips turning down at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, no, mija. He's going to put the things he bought to make dinner away."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's eyes sparkled, causing both herself and Agatha to breathe a soft chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     "What's he making?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Arroz con pollo, and judging by what I saw in his basket, it's pretty close to abuelo's recipe," Rio told her, her eyebrows arching as if to accentuate her point.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been pretty idle during the exchange, but as Rio's eyes caught hers, it all seemed to seep out of her; she love and adoration she could already feel between the five people in that apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     "He also bought wine, so if you haven't had your pain meds yet, you're welcome to have a glass, but no mixing them," Rio instructed, although she knew Estee was already aware of the dangers there.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, mama," she returned.
    </p>
<p>
     "Has anyone ever told you that he looks just like you?" Taylah blurted, though she realized that it had been completely unprovoked and pulled her lip between her teeth, though the other three women in the room dissolved into giggles.
    </p>
<p>
     "A couple of times. It's the mouth and nose, mostly. He definitely did not get my eyes. Otherwise, he's a pretty okay looking kid," Agatha offered back, the smile on her lips reaching all the way up to touch her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     It had taken him only a moment for him to return, and then another moment while everyone seemed to settle in, finding a place to sit.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky was in the corner a little ways from the bed on a kitchen chair he'd brought in, and Agatha and Rio were nestled together on the loveseat on the other side of the bed, on the opposing wall. They all lightly chatted about the amount of travel that had been had between the three of them, about what it was like in LA this time of year, about rugby, which Rio was only half surprised to learn Nicky was borderline obsessive about.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee had even made the suggestion in passing that once she was doing better, the five of them should all go to an All Blacks game.
    </p>
<p>
     The invitation had simultaneously softened both Agatha and Rio, the flash of their first night seeming to hang right before both of them for just a brief moment.
    </p>
<p>
     The afternoon had drawn on and Nicky had announced that he was going to go start preparation for their meal, and Rio saw it open up before her; a chance to connect.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you care if I watch? No judgement, just curiosity. Who knows, I might even learn a thing or two," she posed, tilting her head at him. His smile had been warm and immediate as he gave a gentle nod of his head.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned her head to steal a quick kiss from Agatha, who was looking at her like she was so filled with love that she could completely combust at any given moment. There was something else, there, though. It was this... want to be there, but to not intrude on the moment. For a moment, she could see the exact second where Agatha wished that she could be a fly on the wall of that kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips curled slightly and she stole another kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'll be back, I love you."
     </i>
     Rio whispered against her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood and leaned over to place a kiss to Estee's forehead while concurrently reaching over to poke Tay on the nose, eliciting a genuine laugh out of the blonde.
    </p>
<p>
     "Los amos, mijas. I'll be back."
    </p>
<p>
     She paced out to the kitchen to see him already at work, pulling out the correct pots and pans that he was going to need.
    </p>
<p>
     She was quiet in her interest, letting him find his method. She was actually a little caught off guard when he pulled a Ziplock bag out, one that he had very obviously used to marinate the chicken -- hours ago when he had put the groceries away.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, he was good.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, Rio spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did your mom teach you to cook?" she asked him softly, tilting her head in curiosity.
    </p>
<p>
     He glanced at her over his shoulder, his smile genuine in its sincerity.
    </p>
<p>
     "She did, when I was six. And I've only cut off one fingertip in the fourteen years since," he replied with a smooth chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's something you're passionate about, clearly."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky was quiet for a moment as he worked, never stopping, but not responding either. As he reached a point where he felt like he could pause, he turned around to face her, her eyes searching her face for a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm going to level with you for a minute here, okay?" he stated, though his words were quietly demanding in their need for understanding. "I'm not sure how much she's told you... But most of the good memories I have... they're of the two of us cooking, making things together. And so... when I miss her, or when I feel like maybe I've let her down... I just... cook."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's expression nearly dissolved into an expression of bearing an ache. She got it, but she could also see that the two of them were actively working on repairing their relationship.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I can tell you with certainty,"
     </i>
     Rio informed him gently,
     <i>
      "that there is very little in this world you could do that would let her down. You're a wonder to her, each and every day."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yeah?"
     </i>
     Nicky posed, the curiosity in his eyes seamlessly sliding into something a bit more knowing.
     <i>
      "Have you realized yet that you are, too?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     His words were gentle in their delivery, but they pierced through her with startling ease.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I think it literally
      <b>
       just
      </b>
      hit me."
     </i>

<p>
      He said, "Here, here and here."
      <br/>
      He pointed to his heart and mind and ears.
     </p>
<p>
      *****
     </p>
</center>
<p>
     Rio had been merely an observer as Nicky seemed to float his way through that kitchen, moving with an ease of having done this before. She was so... perplexed by him. She could see so much of Agatha in him, even far beyond the physical similarities. She could see Agatha's drive, her compassion, her heart.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky was a kid who'd simply not had the best childhood. Granted, it surely could have been worse, but his trauma was still valid, no matter what way it came down. What was more was that Rio knew that if Agatha could take it back, or take it away? She would have sacrificed herself if it meant, in any way, improving Nicky's quality of life.
    </p>
<p>
     There was even this thing her did, so small and almost noticeable, but whenever he was deep in the throes of his concentration, his hand would flick out to the side, as if he were channeling the distracted energy and tossing it aside. It was something she'd noticed Agatha doing once or twice.
    </p>
<p>
     A thought struck Rio; she was back in that shower, Agatha directing her on where to send her anguish, her anxiety. That was what he was doing. He was tossing aside his nerves in an almost literal sense.
    </p>
<p>
     After a little while longer, she had paced forward to observe from a better angle, watching him as he worked, his focus written all over his pinched brow. There was no question that he knew what he was doing, and only once did she cut in.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you ever sneak in a chile de arbol?" she questioned over his shoulder, watching as the meal was coming together.
    </p>
<p>
     "I do," Nicky responded with a breath of a chuckle. "But I put it in the chicken marinade."
    </p>
<p>
     "Ooooh," Rio responded, her brow pulling together in a state of realization. "Smart boy," she added, the tone of her voice very clearly impressed.
    </p>
<p>
     He continued about his task, but after a few minutes, his motions stilled.
    </p>
<p>
     "You can ask me, you know."
    </p>
<p>
     His voice was like the sound of a cannon in that kitchen, and Rio's middle tightened instantly, the plug of nerve stopping in the middle of her throat. He turned, their eyes meeting and for a moment, Rio froze.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips parted, as if she were going to speak, but she couldn't find her words and pressed them together again. She studied him, so lax and collected in his demeanor despite the fact that he felt very out of place.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why did you come, Nicky? Why did you
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     come here?"
    </p>
<p>
     The most calming smile spread across his lips, one that slowed the anxious hammering of her heart, if only slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because in all of the years that I have watched my mother move about this world, I have never seen her so... soft with someone who is not me. I have never seen her work so quickly to find an answer to someone else's problems." He pressed his lips together for a moment, stuck in thought. "My mother is not a bad person, but there are a good handful of people who would argue that. She's just..." Another pause, another twisting of his lips. "She didn't have a great childhood. Her mom... Well, mom came into adulthood with a chip on her shoulder from an entire eighteen years of being unloved. So, even when she was with my dad, I could always see it. It was this shadow, this cloud that always followed her, casting the slightest darkness over her. She was always seeking companionship, but nothing ever satisfied her past the physical."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Nicky stopped again, but he cleared his throat, though emotion did not otherwise grace his expression.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have watched, for twenty years, as she has moved through life with this hidden desperation to just... be loved, and wanted. Even when it hurt, when she was making choices that she knew would be hard for me to cope with, I could always still see it."
    </p>
<p>
     This time, Nicky's eyes softened and there was an emotional shine to them.
    </p>
<p>
     "The way she looks at you? Every single time, I can see it, the way her breath catches and she has to force herself to remember the process of an action that should be so automatic. She has always been distant with people, not physical or affectionate in hardly any way. But then, there you are, and she clings to you like you are the only thing that is keeping her feet on the ground. And I... "
    </p>
<p>
     There was one singular tear that dropped from the corner of his eye, but he did not make any move to wipe it away.
    </p>
<p>
     "She told me, when she let me know you guys were here... That this was it, that this was going to decide how she went forward. There... She even mentioned, even in passing, that if she needed to put herself on hiatus from work for a while, that she would. And that was what really stuck out." He inhaled, long and slow, before he continued. "Her entire being is creating, destroying, building and perfecting. She has been making films since she was in college. It is almost all she has ever known, in correlation with her career. So for me to actually see the words, to read that she did not even have a second thought about shelving entire her livelihood to be there for you?"
    </p>
<p>
     He fell quiet again, but because he could see the silent tears as they rolled hot and fast down Rio's cheeks, clearly moved beyond the brink of comprehension by what he had decided to share with her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are the first person I have ever seen my mother love, Rio. And that's why I'm here, why I'm
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     here. In the time I did get to spend with you, I can see that you feel exactly the same way about her. It's surreal, because I know that you've only gotten a couple of weeks together, but... when you know, you just...
     <i>
      know,
     </i>
     right?"
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Rio should have asked for permission before crossing the bubble of his personal space, but she was so touched that her adoration for the young man in front of her won out and she surged forward, wrapping him in a firm hug, squeezing him tight. He was the only other person in the world that might be capable of loving Agatha more than Rio did, and he was sitting there telling her that he had grown to care for
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     because of the way she had cared for his mother in a lifetime that had held nothing but detachment and emotional isolation.
    </p>
<p>
     Although she wasn't quite trembling, the moment she felt his arms move to wrap around her securely, the tears poured faster.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been so panicked by the idea of them leaving that she had not stopped to let herself enjoy them being there in the present.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes were pinched shut out of sheer will to stop crying, but they opened at the beginning of a stale smell, and indication that if their meal was not attended to, it was close to reaching a burning state. Nicky seemed to notice at the same time and straightened, letting her go.
    </p>
<p>
     Without another word, he turned back to the stove and tended to what had almost turned into a disaster.
    </p>
<p>
     It had only been another couple of minutes by the time Rio was pulling down plates and he was loading helpings onto each one. She made a trip with the first two, handing them over to the girls in the bed, whose eyes went wide with the sudden flaring of appetite.
    </p>
<p>
     "It smelled good," Estee commented, "But it looks even better."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio offered a small smile and retreated to the kitchen, returning the next time with Nicky in tow, two plates in her own hand for herself and Agatha, and one in Nicky's for himself. She handed the spare over to Agatha before taking her spot, nestled against her side.
    </p>
<p>
     They had spent the evening like that, all snug in their own positions in that bedroom. The girls on the bed were pretty much stuck together, only shifting when Estee needed to find a position that was more comfortable. They had all been absorbed in some television show Estee had put on, a visual feast with a plot about eight people across the world who became of one mind, inheriting one another's languages, abilities and emotions.
    </p>
<p>
     It was an interesting choice and Rio was even a little thrilled at the fact that they had all reached the point of maturity and adulthood where things like sex scenes on television weren't so awkward to watch if your parent was sitting right next to you.
    </p>
<p>
     The storytelling had been immaculate, and Rio could almost hear the intense interest and processing that were running through Agatha's mind as they watched. She was seeing things through that lens that only she possessed, picking apart camera angles and position choices. She was studying different techniques, learning what she could to better improve her own ability.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been a timely shift in position, Rio having crawled onto that massive bed with the girls, and Nicky having migrated to take her spot next to his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     At some point, as the hours had worn into the night, they slowly began to drop, one by one as the exhaustion of what they had all been going through pulled them under.
    </p>
<p>
     By about eleven, the last two standing were Estee and Agatha. They had been sitting in silence, Nicky's head on Agatha's shoulders with his slumber and Estee on the closest side to her, the end of the little train that began with Rio nestled up asleep against Tay's side.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's voice was nothing more than a soft whispered as it broke the silence, but Agatha still heard her loud and clear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Can I... ask you something?"
     </i>
     she posed softly, her eyes sweeping over to Agatha's in the light of the television.
    </p>
<p>
     Silently, Agatha gave her a light nod of encouragement.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "If... if the time comes, and you know that the only option for your life is to bring her to you, don't take no for an answer."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression had fallen from genuine curiosity to the pain that was caused by what Estee was telling her.
     <i>
      "Estee, you and I both know that she's never going to leave you. Especially not after this."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Estee's brow wrinkled in her immediate distaste for this fact, even if she knew that Agatha was right.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could see it, so clearly, the emotion in Estee's eyes; it was panicked, but trying to be self-soothing. She was clearly trying to piece it together, trying to find a solution that hadn't been considered, but Agatha had been doing this for weeks and was still coming up empty handed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "She'll never ask you to leave your life behind, you know that, right?"
     </i>
     Estee told her, though her whispered tones were dripping with her certainty on the fact.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know,"
     </i>
     Agatha responded, her head hanging a little bit.
    </p>
<p>
     That was where they were, wasn't it? They were at this impasse of knowing that neither answer was the right answer, and they were the only two they had. It was frustrating, it was painful, and it was a struggle that Agatha had never thought she would ever have in her life.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "But... for now, I'm here as long as she wants and/or needs me,"
     </i>
     she offered in consolation.
     <i>
      "And if, sometime in the next six to eight months, I can figure out a feasible way to make this work that benefits everyone involved, then we'll go from there."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Estee blinked at her a bit in the dark, a little more than shocked to silence at the information Agatha had just casually mentioned like it were a simple fact of the universe.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're going to stay for at least six months?"
     </i>
     she whispered, incredulous.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I might have to pop home to renew my visa, but... I've cleared my schedule for longer, so... there's just no where else I'm needed more."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Estee's eyes brimmed with dampness, but she refused to let the tears fall.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I am so in love with the way you love her, Agatha."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's features pinched slightly in a pang of feeling completely understood. She had spent so much of her life pushing people away because everyone took the two seconds needed to see that she was hard-headed, that she was powerful, that she had a commanding sense of authority that bled through her at any given chance.
    </p>
<p>
     But when Agatha finally learned what love was?
    </p>
<p>
     It was a reconciliation of what she had always been and something she had never thought that she could ever be, slamming together with so much force that the impact left a radius of dust. The collateral of those two pieces colliding as it floated to the ground was nearly visible, no longer needed for the structural make up of those core beliefs.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached forward, her fingers hooking affectionately over Estee's hand.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "That's one thing you can always count on me to do, kid."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     A few more moments stretched on in silence, but Rio shifted and Estee turned her head back toward Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "If you want, you guys can sleep in Tay's room, and Nicky can take the spare that her parents were staying in."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes sparkled in the dark with the quick but full feeling that had been building since the moment Estee had opened her eyes, the sheer affection she had for the young woman. She gave a gentle nod of understanding; she was getting tired and wanted some of her space back.
    </p>
<p>
     After another beat, Agatha gave her hand a soft squeeze and got to her feet, pacing around the other side of the bed to gently wake Rio, who grumbled her disapproval.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I can carry you,"
     </i>
     Agatha mused, the flicker of a thought flashing through her mind that she already knew herself capable of supporting Rio's weight.
    </p>
<p>
     Another soft grumble sounded from Rio's lips as she forced herself into a sitting position, Tay only stirring slightly beside her. As she opened her eyes, they immediately fell to Agatha's waiting palm.
    </p>
<p>
     Sleepily, Rio slid her hand into Agatha's grasp and pushed off gently from the bed as Agatha had already turned to rouse her son, who also looked a little groggy and perturbed at being disturbed.
    </p>
<p>
     As the three of them shuffled down the hall with Rio indicating to Nicky where he could go to sleep, there was something chewing at the back of her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Family.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe they weren't one, yet, but the idea that there was the potential there? The thought that maybe Rio might actually be able to, some day, have what she had always hoped for in life?
    </p>
<p>
     It was a peaceful enough thought that by the time she and Agatha climbed into Tay's bed, it had taken her all of two minutes to fall back asleep, nestled into the safe haven of Agatha's embrace.
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The days had drawn on in a constant shuffle between the hotel and Estee's apartment, doing everything they could to make her life as easy as it could be. Tay had been quintessential in getting the majority of Estee's school work to her, and she was set to take her exams the following week from the comfort of her own home.
    </p>
<p>
     After almost a week of sitting around and doing nothing, though, Estee had grown restless, the cabin fever nearly swallowing her whole. Nicky and Agatha had run back to the hotel to grab showers and change, though Rio had only bit back the urge to tell them to just bring everything over, only because it was not her home and she had not really had that discussion with Estee yet.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was cleaning up their breakfast dishes when Tay called that she was going to be jumping in the shower. She had given her acknowledgement and had tended to finishing up her task before she padded her way back to Estee's room. She could tell the moment she laid eyes on her daughter that something was bothering her.
    </p>
<p>
     "What's on your mind, mija?" Rio posed, her tone soft but smooth, as if it were meant to be offered as a comfort.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm tired of looking at these walls, mama."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio breathed a gentle but understanding side as she placed herself on the edge of the bed, careful with how she did so. Estee was not quite as fragile she had been in those first few days, but Rio couldn't help but be cautious, trying to keep from hurting her little girl as much as she could, even inadvertently.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee had always been the kind of person who knew no way to drop her life into a lower gear. She was constantly on the go, constantly trying to find ways to fill her time, to see all that she could see of their home islands.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can we please just try and see if we can go to Bespoke for lunch? I promise I will keep the whining to a minimum, but I would really just like the five of us to get the hell out of this apartment and enjoy sitting on the patio and drinking wine and fighting over who gets the last piece of brie off of the charcuterie board."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's heart squeezed in her chest the longer Estee talked. She could tell that while she had been keeping a smile on her face, it had only been for everyone else's benefit. She had watched as this tribe built itself around her and what she was experiencing and she had started to feel like it was unfair to hold everyone hostage just because she was in a less than desirable physical state.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you..." Rio posed, her lips twisting as she studied those beautiful green eyes. "Do you really think you'll be okay if we go? I just... I don't want you to be in pain for the sake of making everyone else happy."
    </p>
<p>
     "I will be fine, mama, I promise. Plus, I'm willing to be in pain if it means I get to soak up from fresh air for a couple of hours."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward, pressing her lips to Estee's temple in a sweet kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     "When Tay gets done, we'll get you dressed and I'll just text Agatha the address so that she and Nicky can just meet us there. It's a little closer to the hotel than here anyway."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee looked so happy that she could almost burst into tears.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, mama. I just... really need this."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio offered her a warm upturn of her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, mija."
    </p>
<p>
     With another gentle kiss to her head, Rio had departed to ready herself, running a brush through her hair and applying a light layer of foundation and a couple of swipes of eyeliner.
    </p>
<p>
     She had picked up the phone, shooting a message over to Agatha that they were going to go out for lunch, and sent her the address, including that while they did not have to come, Estee and very pointedly made it about the five of them going out together. Agatha had responded with haste, assuring her that they would meet them there.
    </p>
<p>
     It was only a few minutes before she headed back down the hallway at the same time Tay emerged from the bathroom, dressed but her hair still wet.
    </p>
<p>
     She had quickly filled her in on the plan she had made with Estee, and she could see the light flicker in Tay's eyes in excitement. She was likely feeling about the same way Estee was and while she was free to move with her own volition, Rio was all too aware that Tay leaving Estee's side? Willingly? Yeah, that was never going to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     It had taken the two of them a good chunk of time to work around Estee's cast, but they had managed to get her dressed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had sat behind her, taking the time to meticulously French braid her hair, amazed at how much it had grown in such a short time. When she had finished, though, she moved to wrap her arms snugly around Estee's middle, leaning forward to press her cheek to her daughter's back.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mama..."
     </i>
     Estee managed, the sound of her voice immediately tight with the emotion it brought forth in her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Si, mija?"
     </i>
     Rio whispered, her eyes still forced shut to keep the sudden welling of feeling at bay.
    </p>
<p>
     "I really like this. It..." Estee stopped herself and Rio could feel immediately every place where she stiffened. She could almost feel those tears as they welled in Estee's eyes as she found a way to force the next words out of her mouth.
     <i>
      "It's the closest thing we've ever had to family, and... I'm just not ready for it to go away."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's hold around Estee's middle tightened and she hugged herself closer, feeling every single word that she was saying in the very hollows of her bones. It coursed through her, passing from join to joint, swirling in place of the marrow that should have been there.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know, mija. But... Agatha is her own woman, and she will make her own choices. I love her, but I would never try to control her."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Estee was quiet for a moment, and Rio could almost hear through her back how her heart had started to pick up.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Six months,"
     </i>
     Estee whispered softly, giving her mother's forearm a gentle squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Six months until what, mija?"
     </i>
     Rio asked, lifting her head to look down at the back of Estee's head in question.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "We have six months to figure it out. She told me last night. She said she might have to go back for a little bit for visa purposes... but..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In that very second, Rio forgot what it meant to breathe.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "She really told you that?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Estee gave a small nod, though her mother could not see the look on her face, which screamed that she wanted Rio to just accept it instead of finding any reason to worry it could be too good to be true.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mama, I don't want to be the reason you stay,"
     </i>
     she managed back softly, though the soaking of emotion was evident in her tone.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hugged her tighter.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Then I guess that means you'll just have to follow."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     Although Rio knew that they shouldn't have had Estee out in the world so soon, she had hooked those crutches under her arm and insisted with a pained smile that she was going to be more than fine to enjoy a lunch out with people she cared about.
    </p>
<p>
     That damn stubbornness, that whole air about her that screamed
     <i>
      I can do it myself!
     </i>
     just hanging around her, that self-satisfied look on her face. All of it was everything Rio had ever raised her to be, but it made her nervous to see it in full display.
    </p>
<p>
     Putting her own feelings aside, though, she could tell the immediate difference in her little girl. She looked like she hadn't seen the sun in years instead of a week or so, and it was practically glowing on her skin as the three of them unloaded out of Tay's SUV, Rio tossing the keys over to her as she moved around to help Estee out of the back.
    </p>
<p>
     It may have been a little slow going, but as they made their way through the restaurant to exit onto the patio, Rio lifted her gaze to see Nicky and Agatha already sat at a corner table, awaiting their arrival.
    </p>
<p>
     They crossed the space and all slid into their respective seats, the jovial mood seeming to surround them, containing them within its invisible walls. They were a snow globe, a captured moment in time that would live on for the rest of time. It was a feeling that Rio felt everywhere in every single inch of her chest, one that she knew she could never willingly let go of.
    </p>
<p>
     The mood at that table? They were certainly the loudest ones on the patio, their raucous laughter and squeals of delight at different tales seemed to echo into the scape of the city, for anyone within a five mile radius to hear. It was the sound of unity, the sound of joy, the sound of
     <i>
      family.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     They had ordered their food with Rio and Agatha deciding that they would both get something different that the other was also interested in and split each meal between them, for -- as Agatha had put it -- the variety of life, which had caused every other person at that table to dissolve into a fit of laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     Even as they ate, the conversation never seemed to stop, and Rio and Agatha both would watch with vested interest as Nicky and the girls would get off on a tangent that held little interest in the minds of the two older women. It was like magic, watching the bricks get laid, stacked higher, a true foundation for what the future might come to hold.
    </p>
<p>
     They had drained their second bottle of wine between the five of them and Agatha and Rio had both volunteered to run inside to retrieve another one. They'd meandered back inside, hand in hand, and made a beeline for the bar.
    </p>
<p>
     They had been standing side by side as they waited to be acknowledge, but Rio shifted on her feet slightly, turning so that her hip rested on the edge of the bar. A hand raised to tuck some stray hair behind her ear, her eyes lifting to the far wall of the bar.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment her eyes settled and she realized what -- or who -- she was looking at?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stopped breathing. It wasn't even that she had sucked in a sharp breath, or had made any kind of sound that would have indicated to Agatha that something was very, very wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     As her trembling hand raised to reach out to Agatha, her terrified gaze still stuck straight ahead, his head turned and he was staring directly at her, the wave of recognition washing over his expression.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio sputtered, but it was hardly audible over the noise of the restaurant.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
<b>
       "Agatha."
      </b>
</i>
     It wasn't much louder, but it was more firm.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head turned and immediately, her face shifted into a look of worry. Rio looked like she had literally just seen a ghost; her skin was pale and it looked like she was going to throw up at any given moment.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "C-cash out. We... We need to leave,"
     </i>
     she stammered, though her gaze still had not moved, something Agatha was suddenly realizing.
    </p>
<p>
     As casually as she could manage, Agatha shifted, turning her gaze to sweep over the back wall, and while she spotted him instantly? She didn't let her eyes linger and continued to look around.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had not needed to say the words out loud for Agatha to see the similarities, however minute, when she looked at the image of Estee in her mind's eye.
    </p>
<p>
     "Text Estee, tell her to have them exit the front gate I saw. We'll meet them in the parking lot," Agatha instructed as she indicated to the bartender to close their tab. She had bent over to sign the receipt at the same time Elias slid off of his chair, his eyes still locked on Rio, a sickeningly sinister smile on his lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand shot up, gripping Agatha's arm -- hard -- in a panic.
    </p>
<p>
     All at once, Agatha threw the pen down on the bar top and snapped back to full height, turning to her left so that she had placed herself directly in front of Rio, her hand whipping up to plant on his chest as he entered her vicinity.
    </p>
<p>
     "Back off," she warned in a low growl.
    </p>
<p>
     The man scoffed at her. "And you are?" he asked in a sneer, sizing Agatha up. Her fist was clenched at her side, her nails digging into her own palm.
    </p>
<p>
     "Someone I promise you, you don't want to mess with," she returned sharply, her voice oozing venom.
    </p>
<p>
     He shuffled to the side, at the same time, reaching out for Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't even a thought.
    </p>
<p>
     It was an action.
    </p>
<p>
     One that happened with a lightning quick precision.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had cocked her arm and released one
     <i>
      hell
     </i>
     of a punch, landing it just below his right eye. He hadn't staggered back far enough, though, and the reaction was instant; another blow, this one more centered, the crack of his nose echoing through the restaurant.
    </p>
<p>
     As he dropped to one knee, holding his now bleeding and busted face, Agatha leaned down, close to his ear so that he could hear her crystal clear, but no one else could.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "If I
      <b>
       ever
      </b>
      see your face again, and you
      <b>
       ever
      </b>
      try to speak to my girlfriend for as long as you so fucking live, I will see to it that whatever parts you might end up in are never found."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     With that, she turned and ignored the look of every patron in that restaurant, her hand sliding into Rio's as they made their way out, Agatha shaking her free hand out in a quest for relief from the pain it had incurred in the contact.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the fact that Rio felt like a shell of a human in that moment?
    </p>
<p>
     What Agatha had just done?
    </p>
<p>
     She had literally just beat the shit out of the man that was the very reason Rio had become the way she was. Agatha had seen what he had done, what his impact had been on the woman she loved, and she had taken charge.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was Rio's savior.

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     Although Rio had been the one to pull Agatha out of those front doors, it was Agatha that surged past her. Her pace was quick and she was nearly dragging Rio, who was still in a complete state of shock at everything that had unfolded in the course of an entire two minutes. She simply let Agatha guide her where she needed to go, following her blindly, at that point.
    </p>
<p>
     They crossed the length of the building and made it to the parking lot, where all three of their children were waiting.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee had been just about to ask why they wanted to call it quits so soon, but the moment she took in the deep crimson on Agatha's cheeks and the way her mother looked sickly and pale? Her eyes darted back from her mother to Agatha, a quick back and forth as she tried to assess who was going to be more likely to answer her questions.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite how angry she looked, Estee was putting her money on Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "What happened?" she asked, her voice strong but not demanding. Her eyes shifted down to Rio, though, who's expression was utterly helpless.
    </p>
<p>
     "We should talk about this somewhere else," Agatha answered as diplomatically as possible, though her tone gave her away.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't just angry. She was
     <i>
      seething.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "Mom..." came Nicky's voice, a calm in the storm.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's gaze cut to him, that raging fire burning so impossibly hot in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "I
     <i>
      said
     </i>
     we will talk about this
     <i>
      somewhere else.
     </i>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     All three of them straightened up, their eyes matching in the way they widened.
    </p>
<p>
     There was this new tension; Nicky was seeing a side of Agatha that, while familiar, was one she had never used in his direction. Estee? She was hyper-focused on the fact that Rio looked like she needed medical attention. What the fuck had happened in there?
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't just stand there!" Agatha barked, causing Nicky and Tay to snap into the action of helping get Estee into the vehicle.
    </p>
<p>
     That terrified, panicking, hard edge that had lined her in those moments?
    </p>
<p>
     It melted the moment that she looked back at Rio, who still didn't even seem present.
    </p>
<p>
     Because she wasn't.
    </p>
<p>
     There was nothing but a thundering roar happening inside of her head. To her, it had felt like the panic attack that had taken her over that night Nicky had showed up, but it was far more intense. Instead, it had robbed her of her cognition, of her ability to feel like a person. For twenty years, she had outrun her past. She had found a way to keep going, to never stop, to never look back.
    </p>
<p>
     She had raised Estee with no help from anyone other than her own father until even he was no longer around. She had been the sole reason that Estee was the woman she was. He had no part, and he'd had no reason to seek her out.
    </p>
<p>
     It had shaken her, knowing that he had reached out to her daughter, but actually seeing him? Actually looking into those eyes? It had completely tanked her, completely submerged her in the waters of the Arctic. She was freezing cold, trembling in the sheer numbness of it all.
    </p>
<p>
     And then suddenly -- warmth.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still hollow, still devoid of any coherent thought that could command her into presence, but she was enveloped in an instant embrace as Agatha pulled her into her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't shaking, wasn't showing physical signs of crying, but the tears had not stopped pouring. She was hurting, but it felt so distant, like it was happening to someone else the next street over. It didn't feel like the wound was to her, and yet, there she stood, bleeding out.
    </p>
<p>
     Like a crack of thunder on a still night, Agatha's voice sounded, so close to her ear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm right here. I've got you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was the softest, the smoothest sound. It was like hearing a choir on Christmas morning. It was a salvation, an offering of hope.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're okay. I know it doesn't feel that way, but you are. You're right here, with me. You're safe."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Each word, a deliverance.
    </p>
<p>
     It was reaching those depths, but the reaction was limited. It wasn't reaching far enough.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know it's hard, but we have to go. Someone's probably going to call the police, so we should get home."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's face, which was pressed into Agatha's chest, crumpled at the mere thought of having to move. She didn't know if she could, if there was any way for her to force movement into her own being. She felt stuck, like she had been thrown back to being in college, to looking at that face and knowing she'd never had a choice.
    </p>
<p>
     He had taken her autonomy, but she had been so deep in her isolation that she had not been able to recognize it until Agatha had showed her what it meant to have control over those choices. Agatha had taught her that she was the one in control, no matter how much she listened to Agatha when she was making her coy demands.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had showed Rio what it meant to live for herself, even if she had made the conscious choice to live for Agatha, too.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come on, my love,"
     </i>
     she soothed one more time, hoping that somehow she might be able to convince her to move, to just get to the car.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was stuck, though. The last thing Agatha would do was drag her, but the panic was boiling in her chest, hotter and hotter the longer Rio wouldn't move.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, fuck it.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't put much space between them, but Agatha's movements were quick as she leaned down and did everything she could in her power, heaving the entire weight of Rio's body up onto the front of hers. It was a move she had made before, but in an new, wholly heartbreaking context.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was aware it was happening, she knew what Agatha was doing, but she simply couldn't comply. She couldn't move her feet, couldn't find any way to just fucking move. As her feet lifted off the ground, she slumped forward, folding into Agatha like a piece of paper that had been creased over and over again.
    </p>
<p>
     It took her a moment to gain her footing, but Agatha was on the move, heading back to the car where Nicky was waiting outside of it, moving to pull the door to the passenger's side open so that his mother could pour Rio into it. She took the extra moment to fasten her seatbelt, but then bolted to the other side as she climbed into the car. As she slammed the door shut behind her, she looked down, realizing this was not her car.
    </p>
<p>
     A hand flew back as Nicky shut the door.
    </p>
<p>
     "Keys," she demanded; she wasn't intending on being so sharp to the kids, but she was running on nothing but pure adrenaline and it was clouding her judgement, obviously. Tay was immediate to put them in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     She started the car and was quick in their exit, but as she started driving, she realized that she had no idea where she was going.
    </p>
<p>
     She pressed her lips together and inhaled a slow breath.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Girls, can you help me get back to the apartment?"
     </i>
     she requested, her voice dropping into something akin to an ashamed murmur.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee was the one to speak up, indicating where she needed to turn next. Even though she was helping to navigate, the fact was that her eyes had hardly left what she could see of Rio in the passenger's seat.
    </p>
<p>
     What had happened in that restaurant?
    </p>
<p>
     She fought the urge to ask, multiple times, instead keeping her comments strictly to getting them where they needed to go.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha parked the car at the base of the building. She placed her hand on the back of the passenger's seat headrest so that she could turn to look at their children in the backseat.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm sorry for the way I spoke to all of you. It wasn't okay, no matter what happened. But... if you guys could help Estee into the apartment, we'll join you in a moment, okay? And then I promise, we'll talk."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She was met with quiet nods of understanding, taking one more good look at them before she turned back around, her hand reaching across the space between the front seats to pick up Rio's hand. It felt... so limp. So... lifeless.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could recognize this for what it was; Rio was literally in shock. The lights were on, but no one was home. She was coping, she was tucking back her consciousness while the rest of her dealt with the blow that had been dealt to her psyche.
    </p>
<p>
     It only took a moment to process, to run through options. As she watched the children disappear inside of the apartment, Agatha showed a flagrant disregard for her own physical comfort, but was also thankful for the extra bit of space she had to work with because of the size of the vehicle.
    </p>
<p>
     With all the grace of a newborn fawn, Agatha managed to somehow climb over the middle console, turning so that she was facing Rio as she sank to her kneed before her. It wasn't the most practical idea, and it was uncomfortable, but she didn't care. She reached forward, pulling Rio's hands into her own, looking down at them.
    </p>
<p>
     The hardest part of those moments? How despondent Rio seemed. There was not a single flicker of the Rio that Agatha had come to know like the back of her own hand in those green eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's actions were both gentle and deliberate as she encased Rio's hands between her own palms, holding them tight, trying to warm them. Her helpless gaze searched across her face, darting over every single feature in some attempt to try and find some sort of jumping-off point that might make this end sooner.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced back down at their hands and moved, gently releasing one to take the other in both of her own. She gripped it, squeezed it, and then she pulled it toward her, guiding it where she knew it needed to be.
    </p>
<p>
     She placed Rio's palm in the place on her sternum that was exposed by the way her blouse was buttoned, right above her heart.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know you can feel it,"
     </i>
     Agatha whispered, her eyes looking up at Rio's face, though her eyes were still cast out to the window, hollow and empty.
     <i>
      "Rio, baby, please. Come back to me. I'm right here."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She wasn't sure at what point it had started, but it almost startled Agatha the moment she realized she was crying. The tears were hot and terrified, trying to figure out how they were going to get through the next five minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hold on Rio's hand on her chest tightened, pressing harder, paying no heed to the fact that if she applied any more pressure, she was going to bruise herself.
    </p>
<p>
     The tears were still falling and the panic had fully set in, ripping through Agatha like the angry tide in the middle of a cyclone.
    </p>
<p>
     Again, she pressed, fighting the way she wanted to flinch at the contact.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's right there, Rio, beating for you. It's yours, so just... just fucking feel it. Let it pull you back."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There was another still moment, the echo of Agatha's increasingly frantic breaths bouncing off of every window.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come home to me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Although Agatha was starting to resign herself to the fact that she was likely going to have to take Rio to the hospital? She wasn't sure she could do it, but she knew that if it needed to be done, she was the only one that was going to be able to.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, it was right there, almost missable.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes fluttered, moving just the slightest bit.
    </p>
<p>
     While her breathing had been so low and shallow that Agatha had been convinced she'd just been holding it the whole time, her chest inflated slowly, pulling in the first breath of a new consciousness.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was still sat there in front of her, that pressure so hard that she was certain with one more good push, she could crack open her own chest cavity.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, it happened.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt in all five spots at once as Rio's fingers flexed, curving into her skin in a weak attempt at a grab.
    </p>
<p>
     She sat up a little more, her back colliding with the bottom part of the glove compartment, but she didn't so much as wince. Her hand raised, sliding beneath Rio's cheek that was closest to the window.
    </p>
<p>
     In a moment that felt like it lasted an eternity, Agatha watched, the tears still spilling, as Rio found the strength in her to manage the ability to lift her head, even just to let it roll along the headrest.
    </p>
<p>
     Another moment, another eternity.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes finally reached Agatha's, and it took literally every single fiber of her being to hold it together. Instead, what came out was soft and warm, meant to be an auditory embrace.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hey there, beautiful,"
     </i>
     she cooed softly, her thumb brushing Rio's cheek tenderly.
    </p>
<p>
     All at once, the weight of everything Rio had been shutting out came crashing down around her, her face completely crumpling, a soft sob escaping her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved, gently pressing toward the seat between Rio's knees as she pulled her into her arms, tucking Rio's head into the crook of her neck, holding her there. She could have told her it was okay, she could have repeated literally any other sentiment that she'd said in her frenzied panic, but what was the point?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew.
    </p>
<p>
     She had to know.
    </p>
<p>
     They sat there for a solid fifteen minutes even after Agatha had somehow managed to pull her from the state of shock she had so terrifyingly been stuck in. It was just silence as Agatha swayed from side to side, keeping Rio held tightly in her arms.
    </p>
<p>
     The longer the hold remained steadfast, the more Rio felt like she was breaking apart. How had this happened? It wasn't like he had followed them -- had he? Did he know where Estee lived? She had started to rip into an entirely new wave of panic, but Agatha's arms tightened around her at the feeling of Rio tensing in her arms.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I need you to know,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed into her hair,
     <i>
      "That as long as I live and breathe, I am never going to let anything happen to you. I need you to hear me when I make that promise to you. I need you to understand that I mean it when I sit here telling it to you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio managed to blink, trying to process what she was hearing with what she was feeling. The words landed and struck, but the sound of Agatha's voice? Was that even Agatha speaking? It was a sound that Rio had never once heard in their time together. It pulled her back, brought her closer to touching solid ground again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I believe you,"
     </i>
     she managed, though it sounded like she was forcing words out of a throat that had spent hours swallowing glass.
    </p>
<p>
     The softest choked sigh tumbled out of Agatha's lips as the look of relief seemed to wash over her instantly at hearing the sound of Rio's voice.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sniffled, her hands raising to rest on Agatha's back, a simple touch that was nothing more than a need for contact than it was any kind of clawing to keep hold.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm sorry,"
     </i>
     Rio's shaky voice managed, the shame so thick, dropping the pitch of her tone.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Shhhhhh,"
     </i>
     Agatha pressed, holding her tighter, the swaying still consistent. "
     <i>
      I never want to hear you apologize for anything that has to do with him ever again. He's not even a memory anymore, Rio. He has no more power over you, not anymore."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio felt those words in every last inch of her body. She felt them sink through her skin, winding through every strand of every muscle before they welded straight to her bones.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I would be nothing without you, Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio cried quietly.
    </p>
<p>
     This caused Agatha to pull back so that she could look at her, really look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn't just looking at her, or looking through her, or even looking into her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was
     <i>
      seeing
     </i>
     her.
    </p>
<p>
     Both of her hands were warm as they landed on Rio's cheeks, so undemanding and affectionate in their contact.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh, Rio,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed at her.
     <i>
      "You were everything before me, and will be so long as you live. It just happens that I'm the one who gets to see it every day."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned toward her, pressing their lips together in something Rio realized was the most intense outpouring of adoration and love that she had ever thought possible. It was Agatha's turn now, to dump everything she had into Rio in hopes that she might be able to fill her back up, to cure the hollowness that had swallowed her whole.
    </p>
<p>
     When their lips parted, Rio's eyes flickered open to consume the sight before her, pulling it over her like a thick quilt, like it could somehow fight the chill that had settled into her soul.
    </p>
<p>
     Something struck her -- the sound of Estee's voice clear as day in her head. She blinked it back, somehow finding her voice.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're staying?"
     </i>
     Rio choked out, and it was right there on full display for Agatha to see: the painful sting of hope that she could not stand to have ripped from her grasp.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's face melted into nothing but tender care for the other woman as she closed that space again, stealing another gentle kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm not going anywhere."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     After another thirty minutes where Agatha gave Rio the time to pull her pieces back together, they had managed to untangle in a way that they were able to get out of the SUV and make their way into the apartment.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment the front door shut, the television in the back of the house paused.
    </p>
<p>
     This was something they had covered in that thirty minutes; Agatha had offered to remove Nicky and Tay so that Rio could have the private conversation with Estee. At first, Rio had seemed to consider it, but she had given a gentle shake of her head, divulging to Agatha why she wouldn't do that.
    </p>
<p>
     If they were going to be building this unit, this... family, then transparency was going to be a necessity. She knew that Estee would not feel embarrassed, or like Rio should have handled it differently. Estee was not ashamed of the courage her mother had showed her entire life, and she never would be.
    </p>
<p>
     So, as they paced down the hallway and appeared in the doorway? All three pairs of eyes were on them -- Nicky sat on the corner of the bed, both of the girls in their assumed positions -- and all three postures softened almost at the exact same time. It was Estee's voice that came first, though.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mama..."
     </i>
     she breathed. She wasn't going to ask her if she was okay, because whatever had happened had clearly injured her and was going to take some form of recovery.
    </p>
<p>
     Without a word, she pulled Agatha to the loveseat and nearly folded onto it next to her, trying to dig up every last ounce of courage that she could find to have this conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     She lifted her gaze, meeting Estee's across the bed. She knew that she was having this conversation with all of them, but she needed the peace she had always found in her daughter's beautiful face to truly gather that courage.
    </p>
<p>
     "Elias was in the restaurant when we went in for more wine." Rio's voice surprised even herself in its strength, although that resolve wavered not a minute later at the way Estee's eyes began to fill and spill with devastated tears.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mama, no... I..."
     </i>
     she choked out. Rio had almost missed it, the way Tay had picked up Estee's hand in both of her own. Of course she had told her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Shh, mija. It's okay. I know that I... I know that was scary. But... Agatha punched him?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The reaction from four different people happened all at exactly the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky balked, his wild and shocked gaze falling onto his mother. No fucking way. His mom had punched someone in the middle of a restaurant? Part of him hoped that it had happened fast enough that no one could grab any pictures, or else her PR team were going to have a literal nightmare on their hands. Still, that thought was overshadowed by the fact that she had literally punched a man in the face?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha straightened a bit, bringing up a hand to hold forth two fingers, a smirk twisting up her lips. "Twice."
    </p>
<p>
     Tay's hand had literally clapped to her mouth. She had watched Rio live in her peace, and had been lucky enough to be on the receiving end of her love, but the way she had seen her in those passing days since she had come back home with Agatha? She saw a woman who spent so much time tending to the needs of everyone else finally coming to understand what it meant when someone did that right back to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's reaction was nearly the polar opposite, and it was the one that seemed to suck every bit of air right out of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     She sobbed. She didn't tuck into Tay, didn't try to hide her face. She just sobbed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave Agatha's hand a soft squeeze as she rose to her feet, sliding onto the bed carefully to pull Estee into her arms, pressing her lips to the top of her daughter's head and let her cry.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mija..."
     </i>
     Rio breathed, holding her tighter to her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     She shook like that for a few more moments before she seemed to find some way to calm herself. Slowly, she lifted her face from Rio's chest and looked up at her mother, their green gazes nearly mirroring one another as they locked.
    </p>
<p>
     The younger Vidal's lips twitched up slightly.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So the takeaway is that your future literally beat the shit out of your past? What a fucking metaphor."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     And with the swing of her pointed humor, every bit of the ice that had filled the room around them seemed to crack, and then completely shatter.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a collective breath, as if they had all surface at the same time, although Nicky still looked a little lost. From her spot against her daughter, her eyes raised and met Nick's, that previous conversation with him flashing through her mind. He had told her so many things she had needed to know, and if he was going to be a part of this? He had a right to know.
    </p>
<p>
     "When I was in uni, I was attacked by the man that is Estrella's biological father. I had not spoken to him since the morning I left his door room, not even when I found out I was pregnant with her. He was inside, when we went for more wine. I... I froze. I had not seen him in over two decades, and there he was, that... predatory look on his face."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted her head, glancing over at Agatha, holding her gaze for just a moment before she looked back at Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "She did what she does. She found an answer to my biggest problem."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     This seemed to have an impact as a tidal wave of understanding washed over Nicky's expression and posture.
    </p>
<p>
     His own gaze flitted to his mother, the clear emotion welling there. He looked so impossibly proud of her. She couldn't see Agatha with the way she was holding Estee without looking over her shoulder, but she swore she could hear it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      He's never looked at me like that before.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio straightened up a bit, her hold on Estee loosening now that she sensed she had reached a point that she wasn't going to completely shatter into pieces at the sudden weight of everything that had unfolded since the moment Rio and Agatha had both walked back into that restaurant.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, on that note. When we order dinner later, we are also splurging on a couple of bottles of tequila, because I think we all deserve it."
    </p>
<p>
     There was this sudden feeling that ripped into a full bloom at the chorus of laughter that bounced off of every wall of that room.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been content in her life before Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     But life with Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     Loving Agatha was its own beast, but the tender blossom that sat in the center of Rio's sternum was a love for something else.
    </p>
<p>
     In that moment, those sounds filling her ears, she realized that she, Rio Vidal, had finally secured her a life she could fall in love with, too.

       Oh, simple thing, where have you gone?

<p>

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     The afternoon had worn on, and although the five of them were gathered in that bedroom, watching anything they could land on that they thought might be able to distract them from what had unfolded earlier in the day at Bespoke. It shifted from drama to reality to sitcom and seemed to repeat a cycle that was indicative of just how indecisive they all felt as the turmoil slowly ebbed away.
    </p>
<p>
     They had finally settled on a more modern version of a spy film, something that had been light, easy to follow and and had let them get lost for a little while. Estee had, at one point, suggested that it was a good film to turn into a drinking game; one shot for every time the main character, Eggsy, said 'fuck.' Agatha had been pretty quick to point out that they'd all be hospitalized for alcohol poisoning by the end of the film.
    </p>
<p>
     That sound; that bright, full, boisterous sound.
    </p>
<p>
     It was an absolute symphony of different pitches, of different cadences as their laughter combined and overlapped, somehow managing to swirl in the sweetest sound that Rio knew she'd ever heard in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Estee turned on the sequel, Rio had opened the floor to the debate of what they were going to order in for the night.
    </p>
<p>
     It had bounced back and forth between Thai, Indian, and pizza, with Tay and Estee both declaring that it had been far too long since they'd had a Fat Badgers pizza. That, then, turned into a bargaining of just how many pizzas they were going to get and what, exactly, the toppings would be.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the fact that it took an entire twenty minutes to settle on a sensible decision, Rio had sat there enjoying every single second. It was this open dialogue, this back and forth of conversation that, in her solitude, she had never given herself the permission to experience. She had let someone she didn't know rule her life, but now? Now, it was going to be hers, again.
    </p>
<p>
     She had placed the delivery order, coupling it with an additional order to the liquor store, securing those two bottles of tequila after confirming that Estee had plenty of limes in her refrigerator with a sly
     <i>
      Ayy, 'atta girl, mija.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It hadn't taken too long by the time there was a rapping at the front door and Rio was on her feet to collect their meal and the relief they all deserved. She knew it was probably not the smartest choice, and that the last thing they all actually needed was to get completely hammered, but there was something in the power of letting go of control when surrounded by company that would cradle it, embrace it, and never dare dream of taking advantage.
    </p>
<p>
     She had momentarily departed from the two bottles of liquor and returned to their little corner of heaven with all three pizza boxes in hand, a stack of plates poised on top. It was just the strangest feeling that settled into the room, that utter enlightenment of what something like this could actually look like.
    </p>
<p>
     On the other side of the same coin, though, Rio would still catch herself in the quiet moments. That little sprout of anxiety would poke up, reminding her that even though there was a bit more of a deadline in front of them, they still had it. It was still there, looming, however far out.
    </p>
<p>
     They had six months to find
     <i>
      something
     </i>
     that might work. Truthfully, she'd been struggling to do so for weeks, but perhaps with a couple of more perspectives in the mix in the forms of their children? It was possible that there might just be some way forward. She knew that she would never ask Estee to leave, even if she had implied that she had hope that she'd follow. This was her home, it was all she had ever known, and Rio would never force her hand in making her give it up.
    </p>
<p>
     At the same time, though, Rio was grappling with just how hard it might be to put that much space between herself and the best friend she'd had every single day for nearly the last twenty-two years. She knew that, if given the chance, Estee would absolutely push her out the door and toss her packed suitcase out behind her. It had become all too clear in the last week and a half since they had brought her home that she was their biggest fan, and always had been.
    </p>
<p>
     There were other times, in the louder moments, when Rio let herself live in it, let herself simply succumb to the sheer
     <i>
      joy
     </i>
     that came from being in the same immediate space as the four other people in the room. She had tried for so hard and so long to claim that she was happy, that she felt things like joy and elation, but had that ever really been true?
    </p>
<p>
     Sure, but only in direct relation to her daughter. Estee had always been the light in Rio's life, hanging up so high, even in the darkest night skies. All Rio had to do was take on look at that beautiful face and for a few seconds, everything was right in the world, even when it wasn't.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew that although she'd been saved from seeing it first hand, even the implications of what had happened earlier in the day were weighing on Estee's heart. Rio could see it, in those moments when she would turn her head to catch her daughter's eye, only for her to divert her gaze as if she hadn't meant to get caught watching.
    </p>
<p>
     Even without seeing that gaze full on, Rio understood it. She could feel it, the heat of it as it settled over her arms, leaving the hairs standing on end.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee was getting sights of sides to her mother that she had maybe known existed, but Rio had spent Estee's entire life trying to keep from her. Yes, they'd had that conversation the moment Rio thought that she could handle it, though she honestly could have caved a year or two sooner and still managed the same result. However, Rio had never once let on to what those first few months had felt like.
    </p>
<p>
     She had never dared utter that for the first six months of Estee's life, Rio just cried. The more Rio cried, the more Estee cried, this endless back and forth of frustration and pain that seemed to cycle in its destruction.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, one day shy of her six months, it had happened.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee had laughed for the very first time.
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio hadn't shed another tear for a long, long while.
    </p>
<p>
     Sure, life had come and gone and it was unrealistic to think she would never cry again, but the fact still remained:
    </p>
<p>
     The first time Estee had laughed was the first time she accepted that the little ball of light in her arms was hers, and
     <i>
      only hers.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     And there, as she doled out plates and opened up pizza boxes, her eyes raising to those familiar green hues, a striking realization seem to crackle into her, the briefest strike of lightning.
    </p>
<p>
     A little piece of Estee belonged to the other three people in that room, even if Rio would always hold the heft of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee wasn't just hers anymore.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      She was theirs.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She was so, so impossibly loved by everyone in that room. She didn't need a verbal acknowledgement of the fact from Nicky; it was in the way he was constantly on his feet to help her when she needed to get to the bathroom. It was in the way he always asked her if she needed anything any time he went to the kitchen, surely not asking anyone else who was able bodied in the room for dramatic flair.
    </p>
<p>
     It was even in their soft conversations, Nicky listening with rapt interest as Estee prattled on about how the synaptic firing in a person with ADHD could nearly be triple the speed of someone who was neurotypical, or the exact way certain medications reacted with the brain.
    </p>
<p>
     It was much the same way when he would pull out his laptop to run updates for the app, which Estee and Tay had both agreed that they would have used, if they'd ever had any interest in actually dating -- which did not get past Rio by even an inch -- but that the concept was absolutely brilliant. It was when he asked their opinion on the appearance of a certain feature and seeming to truly take what they said into consideration, that Rio's heart seemed to lodge in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     It was so... domestic.
    </p>
<p>
     It was so... perfect?
    </p>
<p>
     No. That was an understatement.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      This was ascension. This was living in the stars.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She sat back, tucked beneath Agatha's arm as the two of them ate their pizza in adoring observation of the interactions between the three other people they loved most in the world. It was scary, really, how fucking
     <i>
      fast
     </i>
     they'd all just fallen into this...
    </p>
<p>
     Ah, there it was.
    </p>
<p>
     That word again.
    </p>
<p>
     The word that had always meant Estee and Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     The word that now meant Estee and Rio and Agatha and Nicky and Taylah.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
<b>
       Family.
      </b>
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's pretty crazy, isn't it?"
     </i>
     came Agatha's voice, a velvety whisper that sounded so close to Rio's head that it was almost breathed into her hair.
    </p>
<p>
     She jumped, pulling back slightly so that she could look up at Agatha, curious green eyes darting back and forth, looking for an answer to an unasked question. The more often that moment seemed to happen between them, the harder it was getting to for Rio to believe that at least some essence of Agatha resided in her mind, listening in on those wordless moments.
    </p>
<p>
     But then... Rio could hear Agatha just as loudly, couldn't she? Hadn't she always?
    </p>
<p>
     Hadn't that been the biggest mystery since the moment they had placed themselves at that bar in the middle of The Freehand, and with an air of complete certainty, Agatha had correctly ordered Rio's drink without a single question asked?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew things about her that she'd never said aloud in the presence of anyone who wasn't Estee. Agatha knew things about her that she sometimes realized she had forgotten about herself. Maybe the question was no longer how or why.
    </p>
<p>
     The question had become, at Agatha's own suggestion:
     <i>
      When?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The relationship that they had built within a month, it didn't explain it. Hell, nothing even explained that first night. There had been no tension, no awkward air despite the circumstances they had found themselves in. The most miserable part of the entire sixteen hours had been watching Agatha walk out her front door, having no idea who she was, but having complete confidence in the fact that they would never see one another again.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, the way Agatha had run up to her in front of that office building, kissing her like she'd been missing it for years?
    </p>
<p>
     No other memories needed to remain, from whatever past life it was they had come from. The important ones, the
     <i>
      only
     </i>
     ones that needed to remain were the resolute echoes of their very souls, bound for the entirety of time. Even past this life? There was something so deeply seated within Rio that just... knew. She knew they would find their way back to one another, back home.
    </p>
<p>
     Time could turn, the world could spin on its axis, flowers could bloom and die, trees could grow hundreds of feet from the roots of a sapling, and the world could change as was willed.
    </p>
<p>
     One thing that would never change?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio and Agatha were meant for one another. They were nothing short of destiny, if it had ever been able to corporealize in two human beings.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, in the midst of every bit of chaos that happened to be those thoughts, Rio found her voice.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's everything I never knew I needed."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There was an instant and emotional gleam in Agatha's eyes, her lips pressing to the small space just between Rio's brows.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Get used to it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio managed the breathiest huff of a laugh, pulling back a little further so that she could bring her hand up to cradle Agatha's cheek. She just watched her, drinking her in, her lips curled in the smallest mile.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Impossible."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     "Here, I'll take them," Nicky offered as he clambered to his feet, swiping everyone's plates as the meal was decidedly over. He turned to take them toward the kitchen, but Rio stopped him.
    </p>
<p>
     "The only reason I'm asking is because it's going to be six inches away when you get to the sink, but would you bring the tequila back with you? And, if you feel so inclined, some shot glasses?" Her smile was warm and charming as it filled her face, her eyes sparkling at him in her sweet request.
    </p>
<p>
     "Only because I like you," he shot back with a grin and disappeared through the doorway.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you really get two bottles?" Estee asked, quirking a brow.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes. Of the Mijenta."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Estee nearly erupted into laugher, right alongside Tay.
    </p>
<p>
     "Holy shit, Mama," Tay managed, holding her side in her laughter. "You were
     <i>
      serious.
     </i>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha looked confused, but Rio picked up on it immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's
     <i>
      really really
     </i>
     good tequila. I mean... Not
     <i>
      'three hundred dollar of brandy that never actually got opened'
     </i>
     good, but still pretty good."
    </p>
<p>
     A dawning of both realization and humor seemed to curve up Agatha's features, her smile pulling a bit sheepishly at the corners of her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     "You googled it?" Agatha asked, an abashed warmth hugging each word.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're more concerned with the fact that I googled the price over the fact that I pointed out it never got opened?" Rio posed, her brow quirking question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Guess I found better things to get drunk on at the time," Agatha responded simply, though Nicky's reappearance gave her a reason to act like she hadn't just said something with that much gravity.
    </p>
<p>
     He was concise in the way he doled out the glasses and filled them carefully, having set the plate of cut limes in the middle of the bed. The three of them that were not on the bed did come to the edges, holding the glasses out.
    </p>
<p>
     "What should we toast to?" Estee asked, and there was a brief but silent exchange of glances as if to see who was going to speak up, though no one was surprised when Agatha raised her shot glass a little higher.
    </p>
<p>
     "To walking in the bike lane," she announced, and Rio could feel so severely every place inside of her that turned to an absolute puddle. Her head had turned and she was looking at Agatha,
     <i>
      seeing
     </i>
     her. In that moment, their eyes locked, not even the smitten stares of the other occupants seemed to matter.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      I love you so fucking much.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's smile only seemed to grow, and as their eyes held steady, Rio knew she heard it this time.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      I know.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Estee, who was wearing a smirk so amused, gave a gentle clearing of her throat. The two older woman seemed to snap back into the moment, everyone else moving to raise their glasses in unison.
    </p>
<p>
     "To walking in the bike lane!"
    </p>
<p>
     The glasses clinked above the middle of the bed which they then dropped them to, all grabbing a lime at the same time. After a tap to the bed, they all threw the shots back, completely synced in the way they immediately crammed the limes into their mouths.
    </p>
<p>
     It was so silly, so stupid, but so... light. It was so freeing. It was permission.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could walk away from her past, finally. The reason? She simply couldn't let it hold her by the ankles, keeping her away from moving toward her future.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would cross any distance to get closer to that future, and it scared her that she'd contained little to no hesitation at the thought. But then again, her recklessness and blind hope had been ever present since the moment Estee had pointed out the obvious about the earring. It truly seemed to know no bounds.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, they had sat and drank and listened to music, taking turns as they passed the remote around, everyone getting a chance to play their own selections. They had talked for hours about anything and everything under the sun, though Rio's favorite topic had been the one where she was pretty sure that she, Estee and Tay had successfully swayed Agatha and Nicky into letting them teach the two of them how to surf.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am forty nine years old. What on earth makes you think I am meant to learn to surf this late in life?!" Agatha had managed through her laughter, dissolving into those giggles that had been sparked by the thought.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well," Taylah posed, her slightly tipsy smile a little crooked on her lips. "For what it's worth, you're the fittest forty-nine year old I've ever seen."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Estee swung her hand back, lightly hitting Tay in the stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     "Just because you've got three shots in you does
     <i>
      not
     </i>
     mean you can hit on my mom's girlfriend," she offered, though the amusement was written so cleanly across every feature.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm not!" Tay tried to defend, but she saw that mischievous twinkle in her own girlfriend's eye. "I was just clearly stating the obvious."
    </p>
<p>
     Another burst of laughter, sounding in every bit of its purity.
    </p>
<p>
     Another shot. More laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     Another one. Hysterical, belly aching laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     Things began to wind down, though, and although Rio would have considered herself reasonably drunk, there was something warm and inviting about making her way down that hallway with Agatha and just falling into her for the night. She'd been of the mind that it was likely she would probably doze off pretty quickly, anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     As the two of them decided it was time to turn in, they rose, hands so easily finding one another in the space between them.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't care if you guys keep drinking, because you're adults, but I'm not cleaning up anyone's sick," Rio voiced as she made her way toward the bed, leaning over to kiss both Estee and Taylah on the foreheads, almost at the exact same time Agatha replicated the action to Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     "Goodnight children," they both voiced at the same time as they departed, causing soft giggles to bloom on their lips as they made their way down to their awaiting haven for the night.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pushed the door shut behind her as Agatha went further into the room, over toward the backpack she had been keeping her life in. There was something postured, something that screamed intent as she rummaged through the bag, pulling something out of it that she palmed easily, walking over to the little end table on the side of the bed she had been sleeping -- always Agatha's side, no matter the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     She set it down, but from where she stood, Rio still couldn't tell what it was outside of a small bottle; the printing on the label was too small to read. Agatha turned, her eyes falling on Rio, the curling of her lips so warm in their motion.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come here, my love,"
     </i>
     Agatha requested in the softest murmur, her hands held out to accentuate her request.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio heeded the call, stepping forward until she was close enough to slide her hands into Agatha's, who pulled her close, steadying her uneven gait. One hand released its hold so that she could wrap her arm into that familiar crux of the small of Rio's back.
    </p>
<p>
     Her other hand lifted, gently laying Rio's own hand on her chest. As her gaze lifted and Rio found herself drowning in those beautiful, gorgeous, mesmerizing blue eyes? She found herself swallowing down a sob that had unexpectedly rocketed out of her chest.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Take off your shirt,"
     </i>
     Agatha requested, and Rio seemed so stilled, a little shocked by the lack of well... anything leading up to that soft demand. It wasn't that she wouldn't comply, it was just that it had simply caught her off guard.
    </p>
<p>
     She moved within the confines of Agatha's light hold on her, reaching down to somehow pull her shirt up over her head, though Agatha's focus never left Rio's face.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward, brushing their lips together at first, but then pressing a little more firmly, though it did not escalate past that. Instead, she pulled away, her hand on Rio's right side gave a gentle squeeze before Agatha voiced her next request.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Turn around."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Again, Rio watched her, trying to read her, but the silence was intentional, but in the air, and in her own head. She watched her just another beat before she obliged, facing away from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's fingertips raking down her back were an instant sensation that whipped heat all throughout her body. They halted, lifting, though the clasp of her bra came free and she let the garment drop silently.
    </p>
<p>
     For as drunk as Rio might have been, she was oddly tuned into that moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hands landed on her bare sides, so tender in their caress as they began to slide down Rio's sides to her hips. As they reached that destination, though, there was something different about the way that Agatha moved. She was being so... gentle. So... careful.
    </p>
<p>
     He tips of her fingers tucked into the waist band of Rio's joggers, but only her joggers, and gently pushed them down, letting her lips brush feather-light down the middle of Rio's back as she did so.
    </p>
<p>
     She rose to full height and began to strip down herself, pulling her blouse over her head, shucking her jeans. As she tossed her own bra aside, they were both left in only their underwear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it just before it happened as Agatha's arms secured snugly around her middle, her lips finding a home on Rio's shoulder. She kept that contact for a long few moments, but then straightened up once more, her embrace loosening, though she was still close to Rio's ear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Lay down,"
     </i>
     she breathed into Rio's ear, letting her go.
    </p>
<p>
     Without hesitation, Rio simply followed her own intuition and did as she knew she needed to do. She wasn't certain what was happening here, but she knew that it was bringing with it a different weight, a different sense of certainty.
    </p>
<p>
     She slid onto the top of the duvet, laying on her stomach, just intoxicated enough that she was not raising much question. That, and she trusted Agatha entirely.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was almost silent in the way she moved, reaching up to turn off the light on the end table before she picked up the bottle she had set there earlier.
    </p>
<p>
     She knelt onto the mattress and quickly found where she needed to be, settling with her legs on either side of Rio's hips as she rested on the curve of her ass.
    </p>
<p>
     There was nothing sexual about this. This was something else, Rio knew.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew it even before she felt the warm oil on her back. A surprised but warm hum fell from Rio's lips. It was low, it was a sound of surrender as everything seemed to slide into place, becoming crystal clear.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned forward, both of her palms laying across Rio's back flatly before they moved, dedicated to the act of spreading the oil where it needed to be. There was a very clear statement here;
     <i>
      Let me soothe what parts of you I can.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had already been well on the way to being a complete puddle, but the moment that Agatha began to actually
     <i>
      work?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The way her fingers seemed to knead and roll into every muscle in exactly the right way, it was doing something to Rio. Or... It was undoing her, one gentle press, one soft pull at a time.
    </p>
<p>
     The gentlest sounds would escape her lips, a soft grunt when Agatha hit a particularly tender spot, or the lightest sigh as she tended to a tense spot.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had never known what it was like to be touched like this, and she thought there to be something rather comforting in the fact that Agatha had picked this day of all days to pour this type of affection into her.
    </p>
<p>
     The longer it drew on, the more she could feel the peace seeping into every bit of who she was as a human being. Her eyes had shut and her breathing had begun to even out, and after another few moments, Agatha realized that Rio was asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned over her, her own front flush against Rio's back as she placed the most tender kiss to the crown of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Carefully, she slid off to the side and pulled the duvet over them to the best of her ability, though Rio's position stalled the effort. As Agatha rolled to her side, she scooted forward, pressing against Rio as her arm fell over her back.
    </p>
<p>
     And even in the depths of her dreams, Rio could have sworn she heard it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      I'm going to marry this woman.

<p>
     Very slowly, as exam week wore on for Estee, everyone else had kept busy -- and as quiet as possible -- as they began to pack up the apartment. Estee had always made it very clear that while this had been her home for four years, her home would always be where her mother was. She knew she could lay roots down in Auckland, opening up an office where she could really get her feet beneath her.
    </p>
<p>
     But then again, couldn't she do that anywhere she wanted to go?
    </p>
<p>
     While Estee had shelved the thoughts to focus on passing her finals, it had been something that often kicked up a waterspout of indecision in Rio's mind.
    </p>
<p>
     What was she going to do?
    </p>
<p>
     They were bringing Estee home, soon, but... Where was Rio's home?
    </p>
<p>
     That was an easy and automatic answer.
    </p>
<p>
     Right beside Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     But what did that mean when it was clearly trying to rip her life in two, trying to pull her in two different directions that were oh so very far away from each other. It had been nearly thirty five years since Rio's father had brought her to New Zealand; it was the place she had made the most memories -- until Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     In ten days, Rio had seen, felt, experienced more than she had been able to comprehend. She got to see the beach at sunset from the back of a horse. She got to see the entirety of Los Angeles from the vantage point of a goddess. She'd known what it felt like to be high up in that ivory tower, where she was meant to be in that office as she looked out on a city that had been so unfamiliar, but had grown to feel like something more akin to comfort.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the exact opposite of everything Rio had always been; LA was loud, it was full, it was busy and twisting up with too many people to count. Rio had always been one to keep to herself, to stay out of crowds. But the way, as they walked the streets, window shopping or just people watching, Rio had noticed it -- the world did really move around Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Couldn't she relate?
    </p>
<p>
     Since the moment their hands had touched, Rio's entire life had moved about the presence of that mysterious woman. It had never really gotten past it, instead just circling. Getting on that plane had been a move that had put her directly in Agatha's path, though, and now, this was her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Could she really see herself in a city like LA, dating Hollywood Royalty? Well, she was halfway there already, without question. She felt like a scratched record, the needle skipping over every carved indent. She just kept going around in circles knowing that this choice was simply impossible.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been moments, as the two of them had laid in bed, that they had tried to talk about it, but it usually ended in one of them getting frustrated and dejected, leading the other to pepper her face with kisses.
    </p>
<p>
     Before, Rio would have said that what had happened between them would have always been impossible, but she had somehow made it possible. But this? This was beyond impossible; there was no clear cut decision here that wasn't going to hurt someone. She wanted to find a way that everyone was happy, but it seemed less and less likely the longer their time in Queenstown had drawn to a close.
    </p>
<p>
     Something Rio had noticed, over the passing few days, was that Agatha had been spending a lot more time on her phone. It wasn't anything excessive, like she was absorbed in something she couldn't get away from, but she was constantly checking for notifications and immediately responding when she had them. She had even stepped out once or twice to take a call; Rio knew that she had put work on the backburner, so what was it that had Agatha's attention all of a sudden?
    </p>
<p>
     The moving company had come the Sunday after Estee had finished her exams, and Rio knew that it was likely she was thankful for the distraction, that she didn't have to fixate on waiting for her results. It was funny, though, because she was mostly just giving direction due to her literal physical inability to help; at least she knew how to coordinate pretty well, Rio would give her that.
    </p>
<p>
     The plan of attack was initially that Rio, Agatha and Tay would fly out first with Nicky and Tay behind them to make sure that nothing got left behind. That had shifted, though, and Rio had decided to be the one to stay behind with Nicky. Perhaps it was more for sentimental value than all else, but she had wanted to be the one to see that chapter of her daughter's life close.
    </p>
<p>
     They would surely fly back for graduation, but Rio had been all too aware of how much Estee had been missing home, and life on that little house boat.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh. Shit.
    </p>
<p>
     That was definitely not something Rio had taken into consideration in the throes of them packing and trying to orchestrate the move.
    </p>
<p>
     How were five people going to cram onto that house boat?
    </p>
<p>
     That was something they could figure out when they got there, she supposed. It did no one any good to be stewing on it until then; it was a little too late in the process to be starting those plans.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe the thought of a full house should have worried her, should have made her fret over whether or not everyone would feel comfortable, but in the same turn, there was something warming, comforting about it. There was something that Rio almost couldn't identify, but then it settled into her chest cavity.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      She had always hoped for this.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She'd never allowed herself to admit how much she needed it. Admitting that Rio's life was not the perfectly constructed facade that she had been cultivating for decades? It once would have been like pulling teeth, but now? Now, she knew that although it still felt like she was living a complete dream, she could say it. She could finally bring forth the truth that she had been lying for the entire duration of the time, both to herself and to anyone who would listen.
    </p>
<p>
     Another thought had struck her, once she and Nicky had gotten on that plane.
    </p>
<p>
     It would be Agatha's first time back on that houseboat since the day they'd met. It made Rio's heart squeeze in her chest with an emotion that mixed somewhere between thrill and affection. In some way, it made her a little sad that Agatha was going to get there before her, but that also meant that she would be the one to welcome Rio home when she arrived.
    </p>
<p>
     So, by the time the car pulled up to drop off Rio and Nicky, she was completely confounded when she crossed the threshold of the post, getting closer to the door.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no sound. Rio tried the handle, but it did not give. It was still locked.
    </p>
<p>
     Her brow pinched and she immediately pulled out her phone, though Nicky noticed, too.
    </p>
<p>
     "They're not here?" he asked, the uncertainty in his own tone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Call your mom, I'm calling Estee."
    </p>
<p>
     They both punched in the numbers, and she could hear Agatha answer first, but half a second later, Estee's line picked up, too. On both lines?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could hear it from two different sources, the absolutely tickled laughter of the three women in the car. It made her heart soar, launching somewhere up into the atmosphere. Not only were they okay, but they were apparently in good spirits.
    </p>
<p>
     Concurrently, Agatha and Estee both revealed to Nicky and Rio that they were simply running an errand, something that Agatha had remembered she'd needed to do. It was vague, and Rio thought they were both full of shit, but she didn't press the issue. Whatever they were up to, Rio figured it probably wasn't the worst thing in the world -- and the thought of all three of her girls spending time together made her melt like an ice sculpture on a hot summer day.
    </p>
<p>
     She had let the two of them in and had showed Nicky around, though there was something about the look on his face, a sudden dawning of acceptance and understanding. He could see, in that quaint little home, each piece of it that his mother had loved. He had studied the plants, even asking the occasional question about what type a certain one was when Rio would bustle by him, trying to get everything adjusted to make things a little easier on Estee. She had been doing better, but if Rio could eliminate any inconvenience? Well, she'd do it without question.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had eventually set about his own work, cleaning out the refrigerator from the remnants of what Rio had left behind a month and a half ago when she had beelined it straight for America. They had chatted, and thrown on music as they moved about, shifting things, finding ways to make it all flow together in a way that would be able to contain the now large size of their family.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time, two hours later, they had given the home a once over and decided that they had accomplished all they set out to do. Folding onto the couch, they decided to watch a documentary about the kookaburra, per Nicky's request, though Rio was growing anxious.
    </p>
<p>
     What the hell were they doing that they'd been gone this long? She was getting occasional snaps from Estee, so she knew they were fine, but her curiosity was beginning to nibble on the edges of her stomach, almost creeping toward anxiety.
    </p>
<p>
     Ten minutes later, she could hear them coming up the walk in all of their chatter and giggles.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was on her feet in an instant, nearly ripping the door off of the hinges in her excitement to see them again, as if they hadn't just parted ways earlier that morning. The grin on her face was wide and bright, noting the couple of bags that dangled from Tay's fingers from Rio's favorite restaurant.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why do I feel like the three of you have been up to absolutely no good?" Rio posed as she stood back to let them in, Agatha bringing up the rear.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could even move to shut the door, one of Agatha's hands were on her side, and the other was cradling her cheek like it were more valuable than pure gold.
     <i>
      "I missed you,"
     </i>
     she breathed, leaning in to press their lips together in a kiss that never seemed to lose its ability to snatch the breath out of Rio's lungs.
    </p>
<p>
     As they parted, Rio's hand that had landed on the side of Agatha's neck during their lip lock seemed to hold her in place, not letting her get too far away. Rio was searching, diving as deep as she could in those beautiful blue eyes, trying to pull it out of her, trying to listen in to what was going on in that head of hers.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So, are you going to tell me what you lot were doing?"
     </i>
     Rio murmured, at her, tilting her head so that the tip of her nose grazed the side of Agatha's, a soft beguiling.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to think for a moment, her eyes searching around toward the ceiling, as if she might find the answer there. Instead, the smirk that wound its way across her lips did something to Rio's stomach, both making it flip and also feel like it had been loaded with stones.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Sure am... not going to do that,"
     </i>
     Agatha answered, her smirk growing. "Instead, we are going to eat our fancy take out from Culprit, which Estee informed me is your favorite, and then we will figure out the rest of the evening. So. Chop chop,
     <i>
      vamanos!
     </i>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     For the briefest moment, Rio was pretty sure that her soul had completely vacated her body with the shock that hit her at hearing Agatha use that word. It was the first time she'd done anything even remotely similar and it was a pit of warmth that nestled right in the center of Rio's middle. Her brows twitched slightly, almost imperceptibly, but then her head tilted at the woman before her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You... Jesus Christ, woman. Knock that off, it's not an appropriate time,"
     </i>
     Rio shot back, leaning in to steal one more quick peck before the separated and she shut the door.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, they had all managed to find a space in the main room of the home, huddled around the coffee table that supported the weight of their meal. Although Rio was almost certain that Estee had told Agatha what to get for Rio, those damn steak tartare cones were absolutely to die for, and she was thankful for the thought that had gone into it.
    </p>
<p>
     The way they'd exchanged forkfuls across the table, sharing with each other so everyone could get a little taste of everything, it felt to Rio like it had been ripped right out of some heartwarming family film. It felt like this was a dream she might have had in some distant memory, something she had thought that she would never actually be able to see, and as a result?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was not entirely convinced she was not still asleep. Rio had laid her head down that night, after watching Agatha leave, and maybe it was just true that she'd simply never roused. It would have made more sense than what was currently splayed out in front of her, leaving her so full to the brim with love in her chest that she hardly knew what to do with it. It was begging to burst through her ribcage, through her muscles, tearing her skin. That love wanted her to be open, to be vulnerable, and she was finally conceding.
    </p>
<p>
     After dinner, Rio had stood to clean up, but Agatha seemed to be of the same mind, raising to her feet behind her. The two of them collected the trash, stowing it in the paper bags that it had come in. Rio had indicated that she was going outside to dispose of them in the bin, but Agatha was quick in declaring she would join her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened the lid to the bin at the same time that Agatha shut the door and paced over to her, that look on her face... What the hell
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     that look? She tried to ignore it as she held her hand out, slipping the handle of the bag out of Agatha's grasp and into her own before tossing it inside, too. She let the lid drop shut and moved forward to where Agatha stood on that walkway.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been under the impression that they were going back inside, but realized the moment that Agatha wrapped her up in her arms that maybe they just needed a minute. Just a quiet moment, a moment to realize where, exactly they were standing, and the crushingly affectionate weight of what that meant.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You know,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed from her position with her chin tucked over Rio's head.
     <i>
      "I really missed this place."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled the softest giggle, barely a breath out of her nose.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's not sentient, but if it were, I'm almost certain it would say it missed you too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted her head and leaned back slightly, just enough to reach up to tuck a curved finger under Rio's chin so that she could tilt her head back.
    </p>
<p>
     Those burning blue eyes, they were... No, it wasn't the normal look that Agatha had in her eyes when she peered into the depths of Rio's soul.
    </p>
<p>
     This was something different. There was this silent determination, this steadfast resolve to do... whatever it was she was thinking about doing. She dropped her head just enough to brush their lips together.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Let's go for a drive,"
     </i>
     Agatha suggested, that mischief showing itself in a bright gleam in her gaze.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And let me guess, you're driving?"
     </i>
     Rio posed back, that thrilled smirk finding her face. Here she was, Agatha taking charge in every single bit of her glory.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Of course, as if that was in question. Plus, you don't know where we're going."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Rio's eyebrows shot up in excited curiosity. For as much time as they had spent in Queenstown to be with Estee, it had not really ever crossed Rio's mind until that moment that perhaps Agatha had done a little more sight-seeing than she had ever let on to when she had been there on her initial trip.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Well then, let me grab my keys for you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She had disappeared inside, informing the kids that they were going to go... somewhere, for a little bit and that they would be back.
    </p>
<p>
     Somehow, beyond Rio's own comprehension, each of them were absolutely fighting for their lives to remain calm and stoic, nodding in understanding and wishing them a good time, as though they were completely clueless.
    </p>
<p>
     She told them she loved them and made her way back outside to an Agatha who looked
     <i>
      damn good
     </i>
     in those orange hues of the setting sun, leaned so casually against
     <i>
      that post,
     </i>
     the nail still jutting out from the side, this time bare in its adornment, no earring to be seen. Her arms were folded over her chest and one leg was bent at the knee, her foot flat against the post.
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, Rio was just stood there, in complete awe; she was looking at the eighth wonder of the world, and absolutely no one else could have convinced her otherwise.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to notice the lack of movement and turned only her head, some of her hair dropping over her shoulder to behind her back. She had this smile on her face, and while it felt so familiar, there was something else about it that Rio couldn't quite put her finger on.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you waiting for something?" Agatha posed, one side of her mouth hitching up in a smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nope," Rio responded, tilting her head a bit to the side, soaking up every bit of that moment she could. "Just admiring the view."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes and righted herself, holding her hand out for the keys, which Rio forked over gladly.
    </p>
<p>
     As they slid inside, the moment her belt was buckled, Agatha's hand dropped over the center console and found a home on top of Rio's thighs, giving a soft squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio looked over at her, she was still trying to listen, still trying to hear what always seemed to be so deafeningly loud in so many other instances. She heard nothing. There was no give, no whisper. Just silence.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha kept checking her smart watch, Rio caught a brief glance and saw why -- she had a map there. And the longer they drove? Rio could understand why.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to have a complete confidence about her as she made her way out of the city, heading up along the edge of the coast.
    </p>
<p>
     "Where are we going, Agatha?" Rio asked, gripping at her hand a little harder. They'd been driving nearly two hours in this strange anxious tension that both of them were hiding beneath the guise of gentle wonder and mystery.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're almost there," she responded simply, though the tone of her voice had an odd ring of comfort to it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay," Rio returned, pressing her lips together for a moment. "But where is
     <i>
      there?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The only answer she got was Agatha's grin seeming to grow as she checked her watch one last time and slowed to make her turn. This only caused Rio's brow to pinch again as they turned into a neighborhood. What the hell was Agatha doing?
    </p>
<p>
     After another moment, the car rolled to a stop. Finally, Rio found it in her to rip her interrogative gaze away to turn her head back toward the window to see what was so important that they had to drive two hours to see it.
    </p>
<p>
     The house was massive. It was a sharp angled two story building that was actually rather striking. The upper level hung over about two to three feet from the one beneath it, and the paneling looked like hardwood. There was a thin rectangular window on the right side. Below it, there was a wooden doorway with three windows on each side that was blonde in color, surrounded by dark bricking that extended over as far as the far wall of the two car garage, the door of which matched the front door. Going the other way, the bricks stopped about halfway, leaving a white paneled space with a large glass opening in the middle of it. It was the same white paneling, Rio noticed, that was on the room above the garage.
    </p>
<p>
     It was... beautiful. Rio had never seen anything quite like it, even having lived in that city her entire life.
    </p>
<p>
     She was completely stunned to silence, trying to process what was being implied here. There was no way. There was no way Agatha had gone so far as to buy them a house. Rio was not going to accept that for an answer until she had some kind of explanation. As overjoyed as the thought made her seem, she had been under the impression that this would have been an at-length conversation before any big decisions were made.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha...
     </i>
     " Rio managed, feeling like she could only taste sandpaper.
     <i>
      "What are we doing here?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha unfastened her seatbelt and shifted around so that she could take in the sight of Rio, and what could be a home for them through the window behind her. Her lips wound in thought for a moment as she tried to parse through her own chaos to say what she wanted to say, exactly the way she wanted to say it.
    </p>
<p>
     "What if you didn't have to choose?" Agatha finally asked her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes narrowed slightly as her brow knit tight in clear misunderstanding. What did that mean?
    </p>
<p>
     "What if... You could come and go as you please? We could come and go as we please. All of us. There's four bedrooms and four bathrooms in there. It's four thousand square feet of livable space.
     <i>
      And,
     </i>
     " she added, as if this would seal the deal, "You're only a six minute walk to the water." Agatha gave Rio's hand a firm squeeze, her eyes never once leaving Rio's confused expression. "We don't have to stay in one place all of the time. So... this way, we always have somewhere soft to land."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, the tears in Rio's eyes were hot and instant, but because there was absolutely nothing else she could have done, no other gesture she could have made that would have accurately displayed what it was she was feeling in that moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips parted, but only a breath came out. There was no sound, no voice, no words. She was trying, but she was suddenly so confounded that she didn't know how to process what was being handed directly to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dropped her hand and reached up, cupping her cheek gingerly as her thumb brushed away that soft trail of tears on her warm skin.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know... I know i should have talked to you about it. But... I've been working on it since the day Estee started taking her exams. And... If it's not something you want yet, that's okay. I didn't really think about how this might feel like an ambush." Her smile softened, almost guilty in its new delivery. "And this is absolutely not to say you have to sell the house boat. In fact... for purely sentimental reasons, I really hope you don't. But... we could all come and go and still call it home. And... on the other end of that, my house is way too big for just me. There's
     <i>
      five
     </i>
     bedrooms in there,
     <i>
      and
     </i>
     the pool house."
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio watched her, completely floored by just how much thought Agatha seemed to have put into this, she could see that there was more behind those eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha straightened up a little bit, but she did not release her hold on Rio's hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am also willing to finance any desire to obtain dual citizenship, for all three of you. Visas work, sure, but... that way, you'd still be able to have what you've always known, when you want it, and I... I get to have
     <i>
      you.
     </i>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     In a sudden surge of motion, Rio adjusted her own position and leaned over the center console, kissing Agatha as hard as she could muster in her very bones. There wasn't anything to say, really. How the hell did anyone respond to that, anyway? What string of words in any entire linguistic history could ever describe just how fucking much she
     <i>
      loved Agatha Harkness?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was almost forceful in its insistence of her feelings, but Agatha didn't stop her, didn't try to tame her. She instead fed right back into it, kissing Rio like her life damn near depended on it. Well, that was one hell of an answer.
    </p>
<p>
     After a few long moments, they parted, their chests rising and falling a bit quicker as a display of their effort. They were just locked, blue and emerald, doing that search, looking for the answer as to how it was all possible that this was where they were.
    </p>
<p>
     Swallowing down the emotion sitting in her throat, Rio looked back at the house for a beat, but when she turned back to Agatha, she was holding up a key that Rio immediately realized was to the front door.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you wanna go in?" Agatha posed, that grin spreading over her entire face, wrinkling the corners of her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "I would love to."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was out in a flash, coming around as quick as she could manage to open Rio's door for her, holding that steadfast hand out for her to take.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's heart was beating so impossibly hard, so overflowing with the sheer devotion to the woman who unlocked the door to their future for the very first time. This was it. This was really, really it. This was the loudest Agatha had ever been in declaring what lengths she would go to in order to ensure that their relationship was something they never had to go without.
    </p>
<p>
     The view from the front? That had been a farce.
    </p>
<p>
     The inside of the home, of what she could immediately see, was not only absolutely massive, but there were giant windows on the far wall, looking out just far enough that the water was visible. It might have only felt so large due to the lack of furnishings, but something about it immediately struck Rio as somewhere she could spend her time.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a gentle tug on her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "Tour!" she nearly chirped in a sound that was so light Rio hardly knew how to contain the way her breath caught somewhere near the base of her throat.
    </p>
<p>
     "Kitchen, complete with everything state-of-the-art that I could ever hope for."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was talking, but Rio wasn't listening, not really.
    </p>
<p>
     No, Rio was staring at the very black, very small box that was sitting atop the very white marble countertop.
    </p>
<p>
     "And --"
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha."
    </p>
<p>
     The one word stopped her mid-sentence, and the look that smoothly slid onto her features showed that she had known it was coming.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, my love?" she asked, as if she had no idea why Rio had interrupted her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was staring so damn hard at that box that she didn't even know if Agatha was looking at her; she didn't even really care.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      There was no way it was what Rio immediately assumed it could be.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      Absolutely no way.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "What is that?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand gripped a little tighter at Rio's, almost rattling her knuckles together, though her words were a stark contrast, a way to keep up the game.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, this?" she asked, reaching for the velvet box as she held it up. "This is for you," she told her. "If you say yes, of course."
    </p>
<p>
     With ease, Agatha used her one hand to flip open the box, revealing what was inside.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no question about it: Rio's heart stopped beating. Maybe it was two seconds, maybe it was ten. She'd forgotten every single automatic function that her body was supposed to be responsible for.
    </p>
<p>
     There, nestled in black velvet was the most incredibly exquisite ring that Rio had ever laid eyes on in her entire life. The detail, the stippling, the design? They were all incredible, but they seemed to pale in comparison to the large rock of a diamond that was lodged directly in the middle.
    </p>
<p>
     All at once, she gasped for a breath as her hand that wasn't in Agatha's flew up to her mouth. The one that was in Agatha's was gripping it for dear life, and for utter fear that she was two seconds away from passing out.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's own hold loosened, indicating that she needed the use of both of her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     It lifted, finding its home along the angle of Rio's jaw, her thumb caressing the skin there.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So, Rio Vidal, would you make me the luckiest person in the world and be my wife?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There they were again, those hot, moved tears that seemed to be the only way she could communicate. Her hand raised, landing on Agatha's wrist as she willed herself to nod, struggling to get her vocal chords to vibrate the way they needed so her answer could be heard.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Y-y-yes, Agatha. Yes, I will be your wife."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's other hand raised, still clutching the box, so that she could hold Rio's face firmly where she wanted it as their lips pressed together again.
    </p>
<p>
     That wasn't just a kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     That was an understanding.
    </p>
<p>
     Their story had started that very first moment Rio had spotted Agatha on that bridge.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, it was time to move on to the next chapter.

<p>
     The moment their lips separated, still remaining a simple breath of way, it was a feat of wonder that neither of their faces cracked with the grins that absolutely split them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had taken the time to remove the ring from its cradle, wasting no time in sliding it onto the correct finger on Rio's finger. The way that Agatha just held her left hand in both of her own, just staring down at the ring on her hand? She had dissolved into utter love and affection.
    </p>
<p>
     They were
     <i>
      engaged.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
<b>
       ENGAGED.
      </b>
</i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      Rio fucking Vidal was engaged to Agatha Harkness.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     This was a fairy tale, full stop. This was something that had surpassed even the most intense dreams of longing and want. For every night Rio had fallen asleep alone, trying to shush the small voice that whined for companionship?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio never had to want ever again. It had become astoundingly apparent that Agatha would move mountains if she had to in order to provide for Rio, or their children. She would go to any lengths to make sure that they had whatever it was they needed in life, and she had started right there, in the kitchen of their new home.
    </p>
<p>
     She had never really considered the idea of being able to float; she had never been much of a traveler, but she was willing to adapt if it meant that she got to keep this, what she had right then. She had Agatha, and the promise of a life that she knew would fill her with endless happiness.
    </p>
<p>
     Was she naive enough to think that there would never come a time that she and Agatha would butt heads? Of course not. Despite the incredibly strange symmetry to them, they were still two very different people. They would eventually unlock whatever differing opinions might lie between them, but with everything they had already experienced? After what they had been through?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could live with it if Agatha was ever mad about how loud she brushed her teeth, or how she loaded the dishwasher wrong. She could live with it if Agatha hated something she cooked, or said, even in a moment of frustration, that Rio's endless optimism was excruciating.
    </p>
<p>
     She could live with all of those things because it meant getting to live with Agatha, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Their edges fit together and when combined, the were able to show a fuller glimpse of what this like could look like for them.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, to add the other three pieces? The image was growing, turning into more of a snapshot, a full sight on what lay ahead. It was
     <i>
      thrilling.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In the middle of drowning in those gorgeous blue eyes --
     <i>
      that belonged to her gorgeous fiancée!
     </i>
     -- Rio had come up for air, something dawning on her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "The kids knew,"
     </i>
     Rio accused softly, though her smile rang through clear as day in her tone.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Of course they did. Who do you think helped me pick out the ring?"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed back at her, stealing another soft kiss.
     <i>
      "And I texted Nicky after you both called to tell him what we were really doing. I met the realtor at the restaurant for the key."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes were full of nothing but stars. She was beyond moved, beyond just touched. This woman was looking her dead in the eye and professing that she could not bare the thought of not being together. There had been times when Rio had chastised herself for feeling that way, telling herself that she didn't need to be so needy, that she didn't need to cling so hard.
    </p>
<p>
     Was clinging to Agatha really that much of a bad thing if she could feel Agatha clinging right back?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't even know what the fuck to say,"
     </i>
     Rio managed, an infectious giggle spilling from her lips, a sound of pure, unadulterated joy.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Gods, whatever you do, don't say 'thank you.' I won't un-ask, but... a few other things might be off the table..."
     </i>
     Agatha glanced to her side, the smirk winding across her lips before her eyes met Rio's again.
     <i>
      "Er-- counter."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In the matter of one single second, the temperature in that entire house absolutely skyrocketed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Gods be damned, how the fuck did Agatha do that?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      Because she was so fucking ethereal. And also so goddamned hot.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh,"
     </i>
     Rio responded, seemingly nonplussed, her eyes hardly following where Agatha's had gone.
     <i>
      "I guess I didn't realize that there was anything else that was supposed to be on that counter. Did you bring a fruit basket?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That devious flash in her eyes was burning hot, and she could see as each one of her words hit Agatha's ears.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "A fucking fruit basket?"
     </i>
     Agatha shot back, bordering on falling prey to a fit of laughter, but she somehow stifled it with a deep breath, those beautiful blue eyes darkening with a voracious appetite that Rio had grown accustomed to.
     <i>
      "The last thing I want to eat off of this counter is fruit."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     There it was, that absolute fireball that landed right in her middle. Sometimes, she swore all Agatha had to do was
     <i>
      breathe
     </i>
     just the right way and it could turn her on, make her weak in the knees. But right then?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had dropped a lit match into a full fuel tank.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt it, from her toes all the way to the top of her head, as she caught fire.
    </p>
<p>
     If the blush was even half as powerful as the actual heat? She was sure that she was red on every piece of skin that was visible, and every single one that wasn't, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand fell flat to Agatha's chest, but then moved, making its way to her neck. Her fingers curled around the back, but her thumb seemed to find that little spot, right next to the hollow of Agatha's throat, where she could feel the gentle drum of her pulse, though she could tell it was a little faster than it probably should have been.
    </p>
<p>
     A smirk curled one side of Rio's lips, applying the tiniest amount of pressure, the force of the drumming only seeming to increase. The look on Agatha's face? Helpless in its surrender. Rio's smirk only seemed to grow, satisfied in the reception to what she was trying to do here.
    </p>
<p>
     Her green eyes had grown dark, her own insatiable famine seeming to rip through her. Her thumb slid up, along that hollow, until it reached Agatha's jaw. With a little bit of pressure, Rio was giving a silent demand, mostly to see if Agatha might actually comply, and she did, her head tilting back.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was watching her, trying to determine what this feast was going to entail, trying to determine how, exactly, she was going to make Agatha understand just how much
     <i>
      fucking
     </i>
     emotion was putting her at critical mass.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't just the physical attraction; it had always been a plus, but none of what they had built was solely physical. It was the camaraderie that had been formed between them, the way that throughout every single minute of their time together, it had
     <i>
      always
     </i>
     been about mutual respect. From that very first intimate moment in that hotel room, it had always been about consent, about knowing there was still power in that.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had put those guidelines down right out of the gate, and it was one of the reasons that had presented a bit of a confirmation bias that led Rio to realizing just how fast -- and hard -- she had been falling.
    </p>
<p>
     And there they stood, five weeks into their relationship, and they were
     <i>
      fucking engaged.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It would have seemed insane to Rio if someone would have told her such a story two months ago. She would have laughed, would have insisted that a love like that could never exist in that capacity, and she also would have insisted that anyone who thought it did was a fool.
    </p>
<p>
     Yet, she was holding onto her future, and she knew it after those five weeks.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew with absolute certainty that this was all she would ever need. This woman who never stopped pouring love into her, this woman who could kiss her and make her forget how to breathe. This woman who had every single bit of who Rio was as a human in the palm of her hand, and still treated that power with a measured care.
    </p>
<p>
     They had run over so many theories in their time together, attempt to explain away the irrational, and yet, Rio wasn't certain they'd ever decided on an answer, though she had her own leanings, one way or another.
    </p>
<p>
     For Rio, what this was? It fell somewhere in between their one theory, that had been the first Agatha had posed: Soulmates. The second, another suggestion made by Agatha: Past lives. In Rio's mind, it seemed plausible that both of those things could go a bit hand-in-hand. The reason their souls belonged together was because they'd come full circle from their last incarnation.
    </p>
<p>
     Whatever it was, Rio was just... thankful.
    </p>
<p>
     And in that moment?
    </p>
<p>
     She sort of wanted to completely lay into her
     <i>
      fiancée!.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     With her hand still posted to the side of Agatha's neck, Rio's fingertips pressed subtly along the line of her cervical vertebrae, the lightest push of fingertips into skin. The softest gasp hit her ears the moment that it escaped Agatha's lips and she felt that crackle of flame rip across her skin again.
    </p>
<p>
     Those hungry green eyes traced the slightly pinched features on that beautiful face, curved around her jaw and danced down her neck. Ah, yes. That was the spot.
    </p>
<p>
     A light pressure pulled Agatha forward, but Rio did not meet her full on in a kiss, instead moving to tuck her face into Agatha's neck, hungry kisses doing what they could to devour every bit of skin they could reach. She wasn't hurried, though, but each kiss was deliberate in its pressure, its placement, its duration.
    </p>
<p>
     The hand that had -- at some point -- fallen to Agatha's side gripped a little harder as Rio stepped into her, using the momentum of her step to angle to the right, pressing the counter edge into the spot just above the small of Agatha's back, a surprised and around yelp vibrating the exact place where Rio's lips were in that moment, causing a self-satisfied hum to fall from her own, as well.
    </p>
<p>
     In that moment, she was realizing something.
    </p>
<p>
     In much the same way that Agatha was able to palm Rio's entire existence with such ease?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was just as capable of making that mutual. She had perhaps let herself get caught up in her own head, in watching as Agatha proved time and time again that she would come through, that she would literally
     <i>
      pull Rio from the throes of shock,
     </i>
     that she had not realized the power in her own being.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Intelligent, beautiful, loving Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Dedicated, passionate, driven Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Her Agatha.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha that had once buried her loneliness in any warm body she could find, that had once inflicted damage on herself because she had been convinced it was the only way to feel
     <i>
      anything.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     By accepting that proposal, Rio was going to see it that Agatha would feel
     <i>
      everything,
     </i>
     for as long as she had anything to say about it.
    </p>
<p>
     Something about the weight of the moment and the sudden heat that had positively erupted between them left Rio feeling a little reckless, which was an entirely new feeling for her. While she might have given it pause under any other circumstances? Right then, she could not have given a single fuck less -- it would have been impossible in every meaning of the word.
    </p>
<p>
     The hand on Agatha's side dropped slightly, fingertips snagging the hem of her lavender plaid button-up, giving the most innocent tug. Concurrently, though, Rio's lips latched to the side of Agatha's neck --
     <i>
      that spot
     </i>
     -- just below her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was starving, and she was going to satiate every last pang of hunger she could even consider feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     The shirt had been nothing more distraction, and it worked. It seemed to take Agatha a couple of seconds to play catch-up, her hand immediately swinging up to land, palm flattened, in the space between Rio's shoulder blades, fingers twisting into the fabric of her shirt, tugging desperately.
    </p>
<p>
     What she did not do, though, was tell Rio to stop.
    </p>
<p>
     When she was satisfied with her effort, Rio pulled back just barely, enough to cause the soft pop of her lips as they unlatched from Agatha's neck to sound around them. Another inch or so back afforded her the opportunity to survey her handywork; and there it was. It was a discolored, gently bruised patch of skin that was left in her wake.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You little devil, admiring the fruits of your labor,"
     </i>
     Agatha managed in a low, unsteady drawl that hung on the last syllable just a little too long.
    </p>
<p>
     The wicked grin was immediate on Rio's lips, but she did not acknowledge the statement verbally. Instead, she used the pressure of her thumb to push a little harder, tilting Agatha's head back a little more.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head dipped again, this time to the place her thumb had once been against the hollow of Agatha's throat. She held a debate within herself for just a moment before she completely threw it out the window and acted on sheer impulse.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips parted, the tip of her tongue making enough of an appearance that it could glide, in one meticulous swipe, up that line, following nearly every single place Agatha's pulse was pounding there.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh my gods,"
     </i>
     Agatha managed, gripping even tighter at the back of Rio's baseball t-shirt. Her chest was heaving there, right beneath Rio's presence. It was becoming very clear that each movement Rio made, it was only winding Agatha up tighter and tighter. This was only evidenced by her next shrill line of questioning.
     <i>
      "Why are we still dressed?!"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The question itself was valid, but it prompted Rio to keep pushing, to keep applying that delectable pressure. She kissed her way in little pecks across Agatha's throat
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Well, I'd be happy to help you out of that, but... you don't have a shirt here to wear when we leave if I lose my patience"
     </i>
     Rio purred at her, removing her hand from its place on Agatha's neck to instead drag a lone fingertip down the center of her sternum, tucking down behind the fabric of the shirt until she could no longer keep contact practically.
    </p>
<p>
     A crackle of lightning skipped across those infatuated blue hues, and then she stepped back.
    </p>
<p>
     At the feeling of space between them, Rio's brow pinched in confusion, but it lasted all of three seconds.
    </p>
<p>
     There, Agatha stood, meeting her eye to eye, a silent back and forth of who was going to move first. Before Rio could think to close the space between them again, Agatha's hands raised and immediately made haste in grabbing at the collar, perhaps with a little more fervor than Rio had ever seen out of her before.
    </p>
<p>
     It was so clean, almost one fluid moment as she pulled it up and leaned forward, managing to completely shell it off of herself, not hesitating to toss it aside. As Agatha straightened back up, she didn't waste even a single second before her arms flew back, clearly making quick work of her bra.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been so struck by how completely hot Agatha was that she'd been still the entire time. As Agatha's bra dropped and those blues took her in again, the look on her face was a little perplexed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Well, okay. You have the time it takes me to get these shoes and jeans to be completely stripped down."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio quirked a brow, perhaps the smallest show of defiance as her lips hiked up on one side, a devious smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's posture straightened, recognizing the push back, her own lips pursing slightly. However, her hands slid down over her abdomen, fingertips slow as they began to ride the waist of the denim toward the button nestled in the center.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't believe that was a request,"
     </i>
     Agatha pushed again, fingers grasping and twisting to pop the button, though they did not immediately move for the zipper.
    </p>
<p>
     Again, she was met with resistance, that smirk on Rio's face growing more and more wild.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, Rio spoke.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Or what?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     And there it was. An entirely new facet of Agatha's lightning.
    </p>
<p>
     She was still for just a moment, narrowed pools of blue darting over every inch of Rio's face as she formed her plan of attack.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha saw it, the fact that she was just pushing to play, that she was just exploring yet another new side to what the future might hold for them. She knew Agatha could see it in her eyes, that this was merely a delay, a stalling tactic, than it was to actually put an end to this. She was testing Agatha, trying to gauge what she might do.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     Well, Agatha didn't hesitate to call her bluff.
    </p>
<p>
     She did an almost convincingly good job of trying to smudge the hunger from her expression and gaze, and she gave a gentle shrug. The fingers that were still gripping denim twisted again, this time to refasten the button.
    </p>
<p>
     Without making eye contact, Agatha leaned down and picked her bra back up, sliding her arms into the lace straps.
    </p>
<p>
     Wait! No!
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had almost broken, had almost caved and pressed toward Agatha to make her stop, but she focused every bit of weight she had into the soles of her feet, keeping her planted.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha, still not looking at her, reached behind her to fasten the clasps on her back (though it was almost painfully obvious that she wasn't actually trying), Rio was quick in her own movements, reaching up with one hand to grab the back of the neck of her shirt, shucking it with ease.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha still didn't pay her any mind. Instead, her eyes searched the floor for the plaid, which she leaned down to pick up as well. Rio absolutely did not miss the way she could see very clearly that Agatha had not, in fact, fastened her bra again.
    </p>
<p>
     So, she took the opportunity to remove that, too.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha's head appeared through the opening in the button-down, though, her eyes finally fell on Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio had never seen Agatha's jaw drop so fast, that lightning sparking right back up in those deep pools.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What?"
     </i>
     Rio posed.
     <i>
      "I'm still following the rules, aren't I? I just had to buy myself more time,"
     </i>
     she offered, by means of explanation.
    </p>
<p>
     She could tell that for just the briefest moment, Agatha was both annoyed at being out-played, and also so turned on that she looked like she wanted to physically combust.
    </p>
<p>
     Without another breath, Agatha was back to yanking her own clothes off again, which left Rio with the understanding that she should probably get a move on, herself. She pushed down both her joggers and underwear in one motion, kicking her sandals off as she got to her feet so she could remove them the rest of the way.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could even extend her posture back to full height, she sensed movement, but had not been anticipating an stark naked Agatha to run straight into her, their skin sparking with electricity in every immediate part that it touched.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grasp was frantic, desperate, as it landed a little roughly on either side of Rio's face, not wasting a single moment before she crushed their lips together in a kiss that Rio was sure touched her very soul. It was hot, it was almost panicked in how packed full of absolute yearning it was, but Rio met the challenge head on.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hands were on Agatha's back, at first, holding her as tightly as she could manage as she fed back every bit of passion Agatha was pouring into her. And then, they began to wander. It was about a ninety/ten split of where her attention was going in that moment. The heft of her focus was on kissing Agatha back like that, on the way their tongues were pushing and prodding in a fight for dominance. Their teeth would click every few seconds, but neither of them seemed to be bothered by it in the slightest. That other ten percent?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's touch was teetering over the edge of being gentle; it was still reverent, another rehearsing of something she now knew by memory. Her fingertips pulled heavy lines down the lean muscle of Agatha's back. As she reached the base of her back, though, palms pressed flat to skin, though there was still a grip.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment her hands slid further, each palm cradling a cheek, her teeth rattled with the moan that rumbled out of Agatha's mouth and into her own. She gulped it down, tucking it deeper into herself to motivate her to do this right.
    </p>
<p>
     Her grip flexed again, but this time, she lifted, pushing up on the curve of Agatha's ass, even tugging outward in nothing but a straight tease.
    </p>
<p>
     Another moan -- louder this time -- that Rio had been hungrily awaiting to devour whole.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio moved her leg, stepping forward into Agatha, another attempt to get her up against that counter. This one worked, but with the way she had stepped, Rio's leg  was between both of Agatha's, something Agatha did not miss in the least.
    </p>
<p>
     Her weight sank the slightest bit, her wet core making contact with Rio's thigh in a desperate search for friction.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Rio realized what she was doing, though? Her grip was rough where it was resting on Agatha's ass, pulling her back up as the softest tsk tsk tsk fell from her lips, still only a breath away from Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "No, no,"
     </i>
     she growled.
     <i>
      "You don't get to ruin my plans."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was sentimental between them, sure, but that was surely overshadowed by that tone of voice that came out from between Rio's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's physical reaction was immediate. Rio could feel every single place where their skin was touching as the goosebumps flared between them, as if it were some cry for space, one that Rio would not heed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head back, using the little bit of extra space the action afforded her to catch Agatha's bottom lip between her teeth, giving it a less-than-gentle tug. The moment she released it, her demand was clear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Turn around."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha already looked like she'd somehow gotten her fill, but Rio knew that to be impossible. And even if she had? It wouldn't have mattered Rio. Until she had Agatha shaking like a leaf in the wind, her job was not finished.
    </p>
<p>
     Still heaving, Agatha's compliance came surprisingly easier -- easier than Rio had thought it might.
    </p>
<p>
     There it was again.
    </p>
<p>
     For as much as Rio had resigned herself to being Agatha's?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Agatha had always been hers.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The moment Agatha's lower abdomen made contact with the cold white marble, Rio's front was flush against her back, hands beginning their expedition on Agatha's sides. Her touch was a little less needy, a little less demanding in its search for attention. Her hands began to glide, though, toward that center line of her abdomen, full touches lifting to fingertips. In unison, they drifted up, cruising the valley between Agatha's breasts, curling outward over the top of them. In another motion, still ravenous but somewhat tender, Rio cupped both breasts in her palms, her lips curling at the feeling of her nipples at attention, pressing into her.
    </p>
<p>
     The breathiest and most delighted chuckle escaped Rio as she nuzzled into the back right side of Agatha's hair, breathing in every bit of that lilac and vanilla that she thought her lungs could hold.
    </p>
<p>
     Her movements were deliberate, but she was still riding the high of recognizing the shift in the power dynamic here. She'd always had control, yes, but for Rio to wield it like this? It was a new frenzy that she was running into completely headlong. In that moment, she had Agatha pinned between the edge of that counter and her own body, and she was not going to let her get even an inch away. Her touch shifted, lifting slightly, but so that her fingers could explore a little more on their brief visit.
    </p>
<p>
     They traced light but wide circles, intentional, around Agatha's nipples, gathering a few laps before Rio's fingertips grazed directly over them, rolling them gently.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could literally feel it. It was an emotion she'd experience before, the one where she could convince herself that Agatha
     <i>
      needed
     </i>
     her.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then? Every single muscle in Agatha's body was nearly screaming for relief, but Rio had not quite had her fun yet.
    </p>
<p>
     Both of her hands dropped from Agatha's chest and found their way back to their starting position on her sides. Slowly, they dropped. One didn't wander far, stationing on her hip, and the other traveled beyond the divide of the counter so that it could curve toward her front. She could feel everywhere in Agatha's body where she tensed in anticipation, but as the tips of her fingers reached what she knew Agatha wanted to be her destination, she stilled.
    </p>
<p>
     This drew a very pent-up, very frustrated and very low whine from Agatha's lips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio,"
     </i>
     she nearly hissed in her desperation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned her head, just slightly, out of where it had been nuzzled into Agatha's hair, moving so that their heads were parallel, but her lips were half an inch from the outside of Agatha's right ear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yes, my love?"
     </i>
     she crooned, that velvet tone so goddamn enticing.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead of words, Agatha chose actions as she first tried to press her pelvis forward, and when that offered nothing in return, she pressed back, directly against where Rio's hips had hers pinned.
    </p>
<p>
     A surprised squeal emitted from Rio's throat, almost echoing in that massive fucking house around them,  but her physical reaction was to press, to grab, to cling to. She leaned into Agatha, using the pressure of their bodies pressed together to bend her forward slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     What hit her ears next? The fact that Rio did not immediately pass out was more than just an incredible feat. It was a goddamn miracle.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Take me,"
     </i>
     Agatha begged, fighting to press her hips back again.
     <i>
      "Make me yours."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      Oh. OH.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      Holy fucking shit.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's face tucked into Agatha's neck, teeth mercilessly sinking into the flesh there as her hand finally dropped, her breath catching at the feeling of how positively dripping Agatha's core was.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      She'd done that.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio would have more time to completely lose her mind over that later. There were more important matters at hand.
     <i>
      Literally.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Her touch was intentional, her touch was familiar. She knew every single place between Agatha's legs to reach that could make her head spin without giving her what she was undoubtedly craving.
    </p>
<p>
     Her fingers brushed over the small bundle over nerves, and the immediate feel of Agatha's body going taut sent a ripple of heat through Rio's middle.
    </p>
<p>
     As she took her time, paying special attention to those particular spots, Rio's weight against Agatha's back had continued to sink, and by the time she removed her hand to a very dissatisfied whine from Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was bent over that counter. Exactly the place Rio wanted her to be.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio straightened up, peeling their slick skin apart with a sense of care. As Agatha began to moved, though, a flat and rough palm landed square in the middle of her back, keeping her exactly where she was.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Fuck, Rio!"
     </i>
     Agatha gasped, though she didn't resist against the contact.
    </p>
<p>
     Carefully, Rio shifted, placing her right leg behind Agatha's left so that they were slightly staggered in the location of their positions. Her hand did not lift, though, at least not at first. After only a moment, it began to float through the sea of Agatha's skin, the sea she could drown in time and time again, and made its way to the side of her right thigh. She gave a light tap in silent command, one that Agatha submitted to immediately by widening her stance a little bit.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, it was Rio's turn.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned back over again, her torso only partially covering Agatha's back as her lips got as close to Agatha's ear as she could manage.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Good girl."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Another soft gasp, one that showed that in any world they were in, Agatha surely had never expected that.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she lifted her weight, though, she took the time to pepper kisses across Agatha's shoulder and she let her hand begin its journey again. It trekked back up Agatha's hip, but instead of venturing forth, it slid around that delicious curve of her backside. Once it was more centered, there it was again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Touch.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio!"
     </i>
     Agatha's voiced sounded in a pleading cry. It was clear that Rio had clearly accomplished the majority of what she had set out to do, and so she simply caved.
    </p>
<p>
     Two fingers pressed into slick warmth at the same time her teeth pulled again at Agatha's skin, this time on her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had heard Agatha moan. She had thought herself to be pretty well-studied in how to make it happen, and that she'd had a firm grasp on that curriculum. Right then, though, as that
     <i>
      sound
     </i>
     erupted from Agatha's lungs?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn't laid a single finger on her and yet, she was pretty sure that had made her come. There was literally no other way to explain the way her weight dropped a little heavier onto Agatha as her knees buckled beneath her. There was even a brief moment where she lost track of the moment, but was quick to find her way back, her steady rhythm picking back up again.
    </p>
<p>
     If Rio had been convinced that she could not have been burning any hotter in that moment, Agatha spoke, and it left Rio genuinely wondering if she was still on that mortal coil.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Another. Please, another."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The draw for oxygen was a literal brawl as Rio had to force every bit of her brain to recall what it meant to take in a breath.
    </p>
<p>
     She listened, though. How could she not when Agatha was fucking
     <i>
      begging
     </i>
     like that?
    </p>
<p>
     The moment she pulled back and resumed her work with the additional digit, Agatha tensed, but Rio could feel as she was actively battling her body, trying to get it to hold on for just a little longer. And Rio let it, but she was seeking that thrill that was sure to come in the next forty five seconds.
    </p>
<p>
     She was so in tune with Agatha's body that as Agatha's abdomen flexed against that counter, Rio saw her opportunity. She curled her fingers downward, working in her favor due to how they were positioned.
    </p>
<p>
     Another pressure, another moment and then --
     <i>
      aha!
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's entire body tried to curl forward, but with the way she was pressed into that counter, there was nowhere she could go, leaving her to arch up slightly into Rio's half-coverage of her. The moan that she released was damn near a scream and her entire body began to tremble. Very gingerly, Rio pulled her hand back, though she was quick in her next movement to fully cover Agatha's back with her own body, holding her in place to keep her from melting right off the side of that counter.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips graced light lines over the skin of Agatha's back, or at least the parts she could reach from where she was, and she simply held her as she rode out every ripple of every wave that tore through her.
    </p>
<p>
     Another few moments of labored breaths and the quiet sound of Rio's kisses on Agatha's skin passed before Rio started to move, gently lifting her weight off of Agatha's back so that she could have any space she might need while she continued to make sense of the world again.
    </p>
<p>
     A lone fingertip traced down the very middle of Agatha's spine, causing her to shiver. As she finally lifted her head, though, and her eyes met Rio's over her shoulder?
    </p>
<p>
     There was this wily look in her eyes, one that was almost as loud as that smirk she was wearing.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I did it,"
     </i>
     Agatha sounded, her voice rough like gravel. Rio's expression showed her question, to which Agatha's smirk only grew.
     <i>
      "I secured my lifetime membership to whatever the fuck that always is."
     </i>
     At the exact same moment, those gorgeous eyes flickered down to Rio's left hand, her grin instant.
    </p>
<p>
     In a wave of heat and wanting, Rio was tired of waiting. She reached forward, giving a commanding pull on Agatha's shoulder, who was quick to obey.
    </p>
<p>
     She was back at full height in a snap but before she could even step back, Rio was moving, sliding in front of her, though Agatha was almost certain that counter top was dangerously close to Rio's back. She did not push, though. No, that didn't seem to be Agatha's agenda.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, Rio smashed their lips together in another starved kiss that devolved into a flurry of those familiar swallowed moans, clicking teeth and hot breaths. She knew, at some point, that Agatha's arm had wound around her back, but she was entirely too focused on the act of kissing the warmth out of herself and into Agatha in an attempt to try and cool off.
    </p>
<p>
     It was
     <i>
      completely fucking useless.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She was going to burn up, right there in Agatha's grasp before Agatha even laid a single finger on her.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time Rio thought her lungs were on the verge of exploding, Agatha suddenly pulled their lips apart, a unimpressed huff falling through Rio's nose as a result. However, she didn't have a second else to have a reaction as Agatha's arm tightened around her middle and lifted, just high enough that she was able to slide Rio's bare ass onto the cold marble, a startled squeal sounding around them, which caused Agatha to breathe her own mischievous chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she had been certain Rio was perched securely, though, she let her go and stepped back.
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately, Rio's confused expression actually grew a little annoyed, until she saw Agatha looking at her
     <i>
      like that.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha raised a hand, a lone finger pointed out as she indicated the entire length of the counter.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Lay down."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio visibly shivered, and not because the counter was cold. She had understood what was being asked of her, though, she complied. Her legs swung up and at the same time, she lowered her torso so that she was laying on her side, propped up on her elbow on that damn countertop.
    </p>
<p>
     And if Agatha wasn't looking at her like she was the first meal of the rest of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Her jaw set and her eyes were moving, memorizing, logging every inch of Rio she could see. However, Agatha did not move.
    </p>
<p>
     So, to try and force her hand, Rio started to sit back up, but Agatha snapped to attention, pressing forward.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't think so,"
     </i>
     she growled back, and in a movement that hardly seemed real, Agatha's palms hit the edge of the counter and she swung her leg up, perching on both knees by Rio's shins.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew that Agatha could have given another order, could have told her to move where she wanted, but she didn't. Instead, Agatha adjusted to place herself above Rio, who was still on her side, while supporting her own weight on all fours.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head turned, looking up at her and that was all she had needed, anyway. She rolled to her back, that cold marble sending goosebumps racing up every extremity.
    </p>
<p>
     That look in Agatha's eyes? It was raw, it was nothing short of wanting, but it was... so, so loving.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hands raised, landing on Agatha's chest in a way that left her fingertips gracing the protrusion of her collarbones. However, they did not stay there long.
    </p>
<p>
     Using the incredible -- and
     <i>
      really fucking sexy
     </i>
     -- strength in her core, Agatha kept herself completely parallel to Rio's body as she pulled her hands off of the counter and took hold of Rio by the wrists. As she began to move Rio's hands, pulling her arms up over her head, she ducked her own to brush their lips together, that spark catching right in Rio's core. Those doldrums were kicking up again, that familiar pulse of sheer need.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha managed to get Rio's hands where she wanted them, she let her weight sink a little, relieving the muscles in her middle a bit, though she was cautious in just how much of it she fixed against Rio's wrists.
    </p>
<p>
     In what Rio would later realize was nothing more than a power move, Agatha shifted her position, though she managed not to break the kiss in doing so. She moved, instead, to straddle one of Rio's thighs, which seemed simple enough at first.
    </p>
<p>
     But then she moved again, hiking her knee forward in a way that left the top of her thigh fixed directly to Rio's supple skin. It surely wasn't what Rio might have been hoping for, but it would be enough for now.
    </p>
<p>
     She attempted to stifle the whimper that willed to leave her at the sudden and firm pressure, but she failed miserably, the sound spilling past her own lips and right into Agatha's awaiting mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried, really tried, to focus on kissing Agatha, to focus on not giving into her every whim, but Rio knew it was completely pointless. And the moment her hips began to shift, seeking out that friction she was nearly dying for?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's low hum told her she'd finally gotten exactly what she wanted. Agatha rocked forward a little, more pressure on Rio's hands, but more pressure between her legs, too.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "O-oh! Fuck, Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio's strangled tone came, choked by the sheer pleasure that she could feel so very acutely in every single fiber of her being.
    </p>
<p>
     Another low hum hit her ears, causing her hips to twist again, rocking down harder in her desperation.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha,"
     </i>
     breathed against her lips, her back arching off of the counter top to try and close some space between them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her again, but she had not been finished.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha, please,"
     </i>
     she managed, struggling a little against the hold on her hands.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha, I
      <b>
       need
      </b>
      you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     This seemed to catch her attention, her eyes slicing to down to take her in as she understood her directive. Their lips pressed together again, just long and hot enough, before Agatha began to kiss her way down Rio's body, but as she kissed over her stomach, she could almost sense the demand boiling there before it shot up, sounding from Rio's lips to Agatha's ears.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "No."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked, stunned. Had Rio really just told her no? The confusion was immediately apparent, but Rio shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Not like
      <b>
       that,
      </b>
      "
     </i>
     she continued, her gaze never leaving Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
     Like touching a live wire, the shock and realization both struck Agatha, lighting up every single one of her infatuated features. She didn't move, though, for a long moment, as if silently questioning if that was what Rio was really insinuating, and when Rio met her with raised eyebrows as if to ask
     <i>
      Well?!
     </i>
     she knew she had to force herself into motion or risk losing the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Although a sudden ball of nerves had settled somewhere into Rio's middle, the way she watched as Agatha adjusted her position so that she was facing away from her, settling onto her chest?
    </p>
<p>
     There was never going to be a moment in her life where she wouldn't want this.
    </p>
<p>
     The sheer intimacy of what had unfolded over the next fifteen minutes had been completely and utterly unbelievable. There was something about it, something about the way they were both working toward a mutual goal at the same time, a way that they were giving and reciprocating without having to take turns. The build up could be nice, sometimes, but in those moments? There just wasn't any possible way for them to get any closers.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time Rio felt the intense pressure of Agatha's knees on either side of her, her own body had already started to slip, with that sending her completely over the edge.
    </p>
<p>
     There was something even more intimate about the way Agatha's body shifted forward slightly and she simply collapsed atop Rio, undeniably awkward in the way she had landed, her cheek pressed to Rio's shin, though she was still shaking.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's own hands raised, rubbing gentle paths up and down the back of her thighs, doing what she could to soothe her until she could recover.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a few moments of those soft breaths, the barely audible sound of Rio's palms caressing the backs of Agatha's thighs, before the life seemed to find Agatha again. Slowly, and with limbs that appeared to weigh ten tons, she readjusted so that she could slump onto that countertop against Rio's side, her head landing on the front of Rio's shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     In the same instant that Agatha's head hit her shoulder, Rio's head turned, her lips brushing softly against Agatha's forehead, an incredibly satisfied hum passing through her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're right,"
     </i>
     Rio mused, her arm raising so that she could trace light shapes on Agatha's back.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I usually am, but what about this time?"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured back into her skin.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "That was way better than eating fruit."
     </i>

<p>
     There was something so beautiful about the weight of reverence that had settled above the two of them there, completely naked and covered in sweat. It was like a comforting blanket, something meant to keep them secured, so close to one another.
    </p>
<p>
     Their phones had been ringing on and off for the last ten minutes, oscillating between Rio's, then Agatha's. It was an invisible game of table tennis, this back and forth until all three children probably realized that they weren't going to get an answer, and that the likelihood of that being for nefarious reasons was slim to none.
    </p>
<p>
     The feeling of laying, bare back pressed to that cool marble countertop, with Agatha stuck to her side with her head on Rio's chest? In their home? On the night of their engagement?
    </p>
<p>
     There was nothing better.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was completely and entirely convinced that there was no way that their lives could possibly get any better.
    </p>
<p>
     Two Months Ago Rio would have keeled over at the mere mention of feeling any type of connection with another human being that would impel her to make the decision to commit, to promise to spend every bit of the rest of their lives together. She would have been struck stupid with such an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     But that was because Two Months Ago Rio was the same Rio who had not ever actually been able to process her trauma. She had kept going, yes, but she had done it by telling herself it was the only thing that could be done. She hadn't actually spent any time learning how to cope with what had happened to her, or how her entire world had changed as a result. She had just learned to live with it.
    </p>
<p>
     She wouldn't have changed a thing, but there had also been no way in Hell that Two Months Ago Rio could have ever had any vision of what the last month and a half had looked like through her eyes. The bridge. The wine. The dryer. The documentary. The nameless goodbye.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd stung, for reasons she never could have started to understand at the time. Maybe, even now, there's weren't answers so much as there were hopeful theories that they gripped tight like the chains of a swing, life blowing by them in their new back and forth. These decisions they were making, they were big ones, but to Rio? It felt as simple as choosing what type of wine to unwind with at the end of the day.
    </p>
<p>
     To Rio, even the big choices were easy when the person making them with her was Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     With an ease that came with an act like breathing, Agatha had impressed this ideology, directly into Rio's chest, that the world held for them whatever they were willing to take.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't about money, it wasn't even about anything material at all. But it was something that rang true to not only who they had become as a couple, but who they had all become as a family.
    </p>
<p>
     She could pinpoint more than a few instances in which that faith seemed to bloom, reaching toward the light it was being offered.
    </p>
<p>
     One: Nicky. He had been
     <i>
      so
     </i>
     angry that first night, the way he had shouted at Agatha, leaving Rio in that kitchen torn between knowing her place and wanting to put him in his over his amount of disrespect. It had stirred this sense of protectiveness within her, one that had usually only been reserved for Estee. It had made her want to defend Agatha, her own name be damned. That first night, she really couldn't have cared a bit less what he had thought of her, and while it had taken a couple of days? He had come around, of his own volition. He had been willing to take the risk of showing up and facing whatever that might have held.
    </p>
<p>
     Two: Estee. There were so many facets of Rio's relationship with her daughter that she knew some people just could never understand. Estee had always been her biggest fan, even if through her own bias, but she had never lacked in her ability to give Rio a very vivid reminder that life was worth living.  Once this whole thing had begun, though? If it weren't for Estee taking the risk of challenging Rio's narrow view of the situation? Well, it was a surefire thing that she would not be reveling in her post-orgasmic haze with the love of her life against her side.
    </p>
<p>
     Three: Taylah. Rio had always held a place in her heart for the girl that had become her daughter's best friend the moment they had met. They had been conjoined at the hip most of their lives, and while Rio had tried not to impose her own hopes on any expectation toward their relationship, the way they had loved one another before they had
     <i>
      loved
     </i>
     one another? It was moving in its own right. She had watched those girls go through so much together, and when it came down to crunch time, and the death bell started to hum? They both hit that realization that they were so used to the idea of one another that they no longer wanted uncertainty between them that it was what they needed, moving forward. Taylah had taken the risk to fall into the only home she'd ever known.
    </p>
<p>
     Four: Agatha. While there was an incredibly long list of moments Rio could find when it came to her, there was one that stuck out, that seemed to level out a bit higher than the others. Rio could still hear the crisp smack of plastic on polished wood as Agatha had snapped that pen down onto the bar top. And then, it felt like slow motion. It felt like watching through water as Agatha had straightened up, taking a singular step to the side so that she was able to entirely put herself, as a wall, between Rio and someone who had injured her far beyond the meaning of the word. All of that only after making sure that the kids were as far away from the situation as possible. Rio hadn't even seen it, the way he had reached for her. His hand never made it past the edge of Agatha's arm in her view. Agatha had taken the risk of punching a man in the middle of a busy restaurant to protect the woman she loved.
    </p>
<p>
     Five: Rio, herself. Of all the risks she'd taken up to that point, she knew what it was for her. It was that moment, in the hotel room. The one where Agatha had sauntered off into the bathroom to take a shower and Rio had stood there, literally planted in her indecision. She had been so terrified, but of what? At the time, it had literally been decades since she had chosen to be intimate with another person. She had been a teenager. She was a grown woman, months away from her fortieth birthday, and she had been nervous. She'd almost let it win, too. But once she'd stepped into that shower? Never in her wildest dreams could she have ever managed such an overwhelming display of nothing but affection and adoration, a tender care shown to the shell that housed who she truly was.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had taken the risk of leaping.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been right there to catch her.
    </p>
<p>
     Who needed religion when you had a faith like that?
    </p>
<p>
     The first sound in several minutes -- a low grumble from Agatha -- hit the air around them and Rio's lips were instantly curled into a smile, blowing a soft huff of a chuckle through her nose.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You doin' alright down there, my love?"
     </i>
     she murmured as she turned again to nuzzle into Agatha's hairline.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh, me? I'm splendid,"
     </i>
     she crooned back, that soft edge of warmth coating her words.
    </p>
<p>
     Another moment of silence passed, but then Rio was on the move. She shifted a little, much to Agatha's chagrin -- that she made apparent by the low whine she let out -- but then gave a gentle nudge to her shoulder, as if asking her to move. She complied, rolling to her back, though Rio could see the shiver that coursed through her at the feeling of her warm skin on the cold marble.
    </p>
<p>
     With no hesitation, Rio was swift in her movements as she swung a leg over and straddled Agatha's hips, to which she whined again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rioooo, I'm tired,"
     </i>
     she managed, though Rio's smile was instant.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Relax, my love. I'm just..."
     </i>
     That smile, it melted into something a little more tender, a little more loving. It wasn't the first time she'd said it that night, but that didn't meant it was any less genuine.
     <i>
      "Admiring the view."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha's eyes opened directly into hers, and the arch of her brow indicated that she was intrigued.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yeah? And what's it look like from up there?"
     </i>
     she posed back, and Rio heard it, the coyness in her voice, but this one time she couldn't engage. Her honest won out.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It sort of looks like the rest of my life,"
     </i>
     Rio told her, and while her voice was soft, there was a clear intention in the words she had chosen. She meant them.
    </p>
<p>
     In a movement that, admittedly, caught Rio off guard, Agatha sat up, raising a hand to cradle the side of her face. She wasted not even a breath before their lips were pressed together, a kiss that quickly overfilled Rio's state with every ounce of love that was poured into her. This was really what she got to have, because she'd made that choice. She could leap, time and time again, and if Agatha wasn't there to catch her? It was only because they were holding hands on the way down.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hands had landed on her chest in the midst of motion, and as her finger twitched just slightly, she felt it -- that raised patch of skin. She could remember explicitly tucking that away for later, and somehow it had escaped her. Maybe it was because she had gotten so used to Agatha's body so quickly that she had not really thought about it again; it was just a part of who she was.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, though, it felt like a better time to ask than the first chance she'd had.
    </p>
<p>
     She backed away only far enough that she could look down at it. Her eyes studied the tips of her fingers as they traced over the scar that was about an inch and a half long and barely a pinch wide. If Rio didn't know any better, she would have said --
    </p>
<p>
     No, the only way to know was to ask.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "How did you get that?"
     </i>
     she posed, pressing her fingertips over the entirety of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn't looking at her, but it took Agatha everything within her own power to not crumble. An uneven breath released from both nostrils, but she managed to otherwise maintain her composure, for the moment.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "That answer requires a bit of a prelude,"
     </i>
     Agatha divulged, and though her voice was still soft, Rio could hear the strain in it. Her hand moved, sliding up to cradle Agatha's cheek, her thumb picking up that automatic action of brushing beneath her eye. She gave a gentle nod, a silent encouragement to move at her own pace.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "When my mother was pregnant with me, I had a twin. Her first couple appointments, everything looked good. And then, one time she went in and... it was just me."
     </i>
     Agatha's normally well crafted exterior was beginning to crack, right in front of Rio's eyes.
     <i>
      "It's called Vanishing Twin Syndrome. I... I basically absorbed him in the womb. It... I..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was completely still, entirely devoid of movement outside of the light caress of her thumb. She was feeling beneath her touch, the more that exterior cracked, and she could see it in Agatha's eyes, too. She'd seen Agatha upset a handful of times, but this... This was trauma.
    </p>
<p>
     This was something Rio could relate to.
    </p>
<p>
     And something, Rio realized, that Agatha had always been able to relate to, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing that look on her face, almost like she were reliving it all over again? Rio suddenly understood exactly how Agatha had felt when they'd managed to get out of that restaurant. Right then, Rio would have done absolutely anything in the world she could have to make it so that Agatha never had to look like that again for as long as she lived.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took in a steadying breath, though those cracks were growing, and the dam was well on its way to bursting. She tried, as hard as she could, to smooth it out, to try and push it back into place, but Rio simply leaned forward, placing her lips to the space between her eyebrows, leaving them there for a long few seconds.
    </p>
<p>
     That seemed to do it, even though it had not been Rio's intention.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's body offered the slightest tremble, at first, but Rio didn't move. And then, that sound came.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a sound that, honestly? Rio would have been perfectly fine with never hearing again the rest of her life. It was a choked, anguished sob that -- if she had to guess -- Agatha had been holding in for the majority of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Without much thought to it, Rio's hand moved, sliding around to cradle the back of Agatha's head as she pulled her in to an embrace with the other arm. She held her like that, letting her release every bit of what she hadn't been able to let go of for so long. More than that, Rio was pulling it out of her, and pulling it into herself. For every moment that passed that Agatha was in her arms, she could feel it. She could literally
     <i>
      feel
     </i>
     the tension fading at the realization that she was in a safe place, being held by someone who wouldn't let what she had to say effect anything in regards to her feelings.
    </p>
<p>
     After another couple of minutes, she could tell that Agatha had stopped crying, but she didn't move her cheek from the skin of Rio's chest as she started speaking again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "She held it against me... my whole life. It was always an insult of no matter how well I did, he could have done better. She's... a psychopath, honestly. Very old-world ideology. So, because I murdered her precious son in the womb? Well, she had a very clear desire to keep it tit for tat, but couldn't stand the thought of going to prison."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's hand, as it was wrapped around her, began a gentle motion of rubbing at Agatha's arm, trying to soothe her, but also to show that she was there, right there, to catch her as she was falling through those memories.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wouldn't let her fall, either.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "My seventeenth birthday, one of my friends snuck in my room. She brought some shitty handle of gas station vodka and we drank and made out and talked and laughed. Well, we woke her up and when she barged in and saw us laying together?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could feel against her chest right where Agatha squeezed her eyes shut. Her own hold tightened around Agatha, her presence saying all that it could, in the loudest possible way.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Lizzie ran out, but that just left me there alone to deal with her. We had a pretty awful back and forth, but awful in that I finally told her where she could take her moral righteousness and shove it. We had somehow ended up in the kitchen, and I didn't even realize it until after the fact. She'd grabbed a butcher knife and had literally fucking stabbed me. It wasn't deep, and didn't hit anything important... but... What do you do when you're seventeen years old and your mother finally tries to kill you?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha trembled softly again in Rio's arms, but her hold did not loosen, even a little.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's... it's not like I didn't know she wanted to do it. I just... never gave her the credit that she was that insane to actually try. So... I left. I stayed on couches of friends whose parents took pity on me. I graduated, I got accepted to AFI, and I ran as far away from her as I could."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha drew in an even breath, most of the emotion seeming to have washed out from the moment. While she'd known it was a necessary evil, having to hear Agatha talk about her own life like that had really wounded something in Rio, but on Agatha's behalf. How could this woman, this complete enigma of an incredible woman, have ever been treated so poorly by the one person that had brought her into the world?
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had tried to shed light on it, that day in Estee's kitchen, but Rio was realizing that even he probably did not understand the gravity of just how awful it really was.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "But... I still let her voice in the back of my head tell me how to live, for a very long time. I knew before I was out of middle school that boys were of no interest to me. But... after I landed in LA, I still tried to live my life by some well-adjusted version of her code, not realizing that it was the whole problem itself. So, I did what I though was right of me to do. I found a husband, I had a child. And... Colton was never bad to me, but I was never happy. And then Nicky got older, and the older he got, the more it seemed like nothing I did was the right thing to do. So then I chose to do wrong things because I was indignant in the fact that nothing I tried to do right ever actually landed that way."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sniffed, and as another tear hit Rio's skin, her heart tightened in her chest, but she remained quiet, sensing that Agatha was not quite done.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I drowned myself in making movies. I poured so much of my time into it that, even though I was dragging him with me, I wasn't considering how it was effecting my son. I poured myself into the only art form I've ever known, but I forgot about filling the other cups around me, too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Slowly, Agatha began to shift, and immediately Rio recognized that it was because she wanted to look her in the eyes as she continued.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "A month before I started the project that brought me here, I got a phone call that Colton was in a coma after an accident. I... still haven't told Nicky, but I know how he feels about Colton's choice to walk away from him, whether it was because of me or not. And so, I threw myself into it, completely and wholly."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it, the emotion building in her own middle, causing her eyes to glass over with the threat of tears.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I had been in meetings all morning, and I had called Wanda to see if she would be able to make our nightly FaceTime drinks. Truthfully, I had been a little upset about how the meeting had gone, but mostly because of one of the assholes that was in the room. It had been bothering me, clearly enough that I wasn't aware of my environment."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips turned up in a smile, though it was a sad one.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Then again, that was the first time I felt like that. But it hasn't been the last. Because... when I'm with you? Hardly ever do I have any environmental awareness. You're the only light on in any given space. And I... I keep trying to figure it out. How... how you've suffered for so long, and yet? You are the sun, every bit of its warmth and light, never hidden behind cloud cover. Ever present, whenever I need you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The tears had started spilling down Rio's cheeks far beyond her own awareness and a surprising sob choked from between her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     She held Agatha's face between both hands, but she did not kiss her. Instead, she leaned forward and pressed their foreheads together, just sitting there as the silent tears streamed down both of their cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had never even considered the possibility that someone could speak to her like that, that someone in the world would ever find it in them to string those words together when they were speaking about her.
    </p>
<p>
     In that exact moment, Rio realized her own power.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could say those things to her only because Rio had given her a reason. She had showed up for Agatha when it was impractical and insane. She had taken time off work, put herself on a plane and crossed an entire ocean with the smallest hope that they might see one another again.
    </p>
<p>
     By choosing Agatha, she had fundamentally reached into every bit of Agatha's internal processing and ripped out every single wire, stating loudly that she was the only person with the knowledge to put the connectors back in the correct places, not the ones they had been in for far too long. Life had wired Agatha to bare teeth, to wield her power. Rio could make it so that she still could, but that she didn't always have to.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn't trying to change who Agatha was as a person, but she would see to it that she would change the way Agatha saw herself.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You are everything to me, Agatha Harkness,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed at her, though her eyes were still shut and their foreheads were still pressed.
     <i>
      "You have changed me, forever, and you have shown me that sometimes, even in the meaningless chaos, there's still light. There's still reason."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's face shifted slightly so that she could press their lips together in the most unassumingly tender kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You are my reason, Rio."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The words breathed against Rio's lips truly caught her off guard, but she felt them in every single inch of her body.
    </p>
<p>
     While the pleasurable come-down had been one thing, this emotional one?
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them had sat like that on that countertop for at least twenty more minutes, Rio holding Agatha who had tucked herself back into Rio's chest.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they lowered themselves back to the floor, Rio located her phone, noting that it was a little after two in the morning. As they dressed, she had picked the keys up off the floor and stepped into Agatha, who had just finished pulling her shirt over her head.  She'd given her a soft kiss and spent all of ninety seconds convincing her to let Rio to be the one to drive home, which eventually worked.
    </p>
<p>
     When they got back to the houseboat, most of the lights were off, but that little television they had moved to the front room was on when they opened the door. The moving images illuminated the form of an asleep Nicky on the couch, his hiked leg hanging off the edge.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Hm,
     </i>
     Rio mused internally with the smallest warmth pooling in her chest.
     <i>
      Just like his mother.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She had let Agatha go long enough so that she could place a kiss to her son's head and took the time herself to make her way to Estee's door, peering in to see the girls cuddled up, asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     As she and Agatha showered quickly and climbed into bed, Rio's legs were instant to tangle in Agatha's, getting as close as she could.
    </p>
<p>
     The quiet surrounded them, and even though she wasn't sure if Agatha was asleep or not, Rio still found her voice, her eyes never leaving the shadowy features she had fallen so in love with.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm really glad that today was the first day of the rest of our lives."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Just enough silence had passed that Rio's eyes slid closed, ready for sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     But then, as soft as the beat of an owl's wings in the night:
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Me too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The sun was not even up, and Agatha's phone was ringing. Rio let out an annoyed grunt, though it wasn't directed at Agatha. Whoever was calling her, though? Rio could have given them a hefty slap over the head.
    </p>
<p>
     The ringing stopped and Rio pulled herself closer to Agatha's form for the comfort it would offer in allowing her to go back to sleep, but it rang again.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted, a tired arm flailing as she slapped around for her phone. She forced one eye open, seeing who it was. She let out an irritated growl, though she answered the phone.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What the fuck do you want, Dave? It's not even 6am."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio wasn't paying much attention, instead losing herself in Agatha's warm skin.
    </p>
<p>
     "What the fuck do you mean I've been served?" she spat back, though there was more volume, and more irritation brimming in her voice. "Open it!"
    </p>
<p>
     This alerted Rio, who picked her head up off of Agatha's chest, looking down at her as she listened to the man on the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't give a shit that it's a federal crime, Dave, fucking open it."
    </p>
<p>
     Another pause as the man did as he was instructed. Rio could hear the faint murmur of his voice, but she couldn't tell what he was saying. Agatha's eyes flew open and her skin blanched.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "My mother..."
     </i>
     Agatha hissed into the phone, her voice thick with venom.
     <i>
      "Is suing me for emotional distress?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     And, with all of the force of a ten-ton anvil, every bit of their peaceful morning had just completely shattered. Or... So Rio had thought.
    </p>
<p>
     She watched as the notion was being processed behind those blue eyes, as she actually digested what that meant.
    </p>
<p>
     And then?
    </p>
<p>
     Then Agatha laughed. She really, truly laughed. It was a laugh that Rio was almost certain would wake the rest of the house up if it continued too long in its duration.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know what, Dave? Track her down, personally deliver the message that I'd love to see her in court."
    </p>
<p>
     And with that, Agatha hung up the phone, tossing it aside as if it were the most unimportant thing in her life at the given moment. The arm that had been secured around Rio's shoulders pulled her closer.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mmm, fuck her,"
     </i>
     Agatha hummed, giving Rio's form a gentle squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yeah, fuck her."
     </i>

<p>
     In the coming weeks, it felt to Rio as though there was more time that Agatha was on the phone than she was off of it. Rio understood it; what was unfolding in Agatha's life was not only strangely poetic, given the conversation the two of them had shared not hours before she'd gotten that call, but it was also something Rio recognized as what the universe was placing before them to see how they were going to navigate it.
    </p>
<p>
     Perhaps this was the first trial.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn't have been more certain of that fact the moment Agatha came in from the deck, a somber look on her face like she had news that she wasn't ready to deliver, and it made Rio's stomach sink.
    </p>
<p>
     Most of the things that they were going to be moving to the new house had been packed throughout the passing week and boxes sat, stacked in random spots throughout Rio's houseboat. It stirred something in her that she wasn't quite sure how to name; she wasn't selling it. No, that wasn't an option. No matter what happened, it was hers... No, it was
     <i>
      theirs.
     </i>
     It would always be a place that they could tuck away when the need for the water became a little overwhelming.
    </p>
<p>
     The thought struck her; Rio had gone from having that houseboat, her whole world, as her one and only home. And now... now she had three places that she was going to be able to call home. Really, though, home simply was no longer a place.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was home.
    </p>
<p>
     Still, that look on her face right then as she appeared in the living room didn't have anything positive attached to it.
    </p>
<p>
     The girls had taken Nicky out to dinner for the evening and truthfully, it had excited both Agatha and Rio that they were all falling into this ease of just wanting to spend time with each other. While she'd not been worried about Estee or Tay, Nicky had been an only child who had rarely gotten the attention from his mother. Rio thought it reasonable to be nervous that he might have some feelings about her now giving some of that attention to three other people.
    </p>
<p>
     Pleasantly, she had been surprised, and she was going to be a little thankful that the three of them weren't around for the conversation that it looked like Agatha needed to have with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes lifted to her as she placed herself on the couch next to Rio, not hesitating to pick up her hand, though she didn't immediately dive into the conversation. Instead, Rio couldn't wait for her to gather her nerve.
    </p>
<p>
     "What's going on, my love?" she posed, giving Agatha's hand a squeeze before she covered it with her other one.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips pressed together, but she still wasn't looking at Rio, even when she found her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have to go back to LA."
    </p>
<p>
     Even though she had known this was inevitable, something about hearing it out loud caused Rio's heart to bottom out into her stomach, decaying quickly from the acids there. It was this feeling that she had been anticipating, but the punch it packed was a little more debilitating that she had been able to predict.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed down the rock in her throat, squeezing Agatha's hand again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you have to go alone?"
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha's gaze lifted and their eyes met, that sinking feeling only got worse, as if Rio knew that she was going to say before she said it.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's better if I do. I have to be physically present to file a countersuit, and if for whatever god forsaken reason she's anywhere close by, I... I just don't want you near her. I don't care about what she says about me... But if she were to talk to you like that?" Agatha breathed a dry huff, her lips pressing together in a hard line. "Well, I'd lose my career and spend the rest of my life in prison. Which, as much fun as I'm sure conjugal visits could be, I'd prefer to not have scheduled times I get to see you naked."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio couldn't fight her own breathy chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted, scooting down a little so that she could lay her head on Rio's shoulder. Automatically, Rio's head tilted to rest atop it.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I know it's not fair to ask you to stay. But... I really do hope you understand that I'm doing it to protect you. And... I think once she sees the countersuit, she'll quit playing her bullshit games. It's been thirty fucking years. Plus, if she keeps pushing, I can't get her on abuse because of the statutes, but I can clearly prove the claim right back. And I have physical proof." She took in a breath, her thumb brushing over Rio's knuckles. "I'm hoping that it'll only be a few days, but it could realistically, if she does try to see this out, be a couple of weeks."
    </p>
<p>
     Although it made her sad, and she didn't want this to be something they had to face yet, Rio still understood it. She got that this was something Agatha had to face on her own, and she appreciated that even in a tough decision, Agatha was still taking Rio's feelings into consideration.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll be okay. I have the girls." She paused, her gaze shifting to the corners of her eyes for just a moment while she considered how she wanted to say what was on the tip of her tongue. "And Nicky is more than welcome to stay, if he wants."
    </p>
<p>
     She could almost feel it, although Rio couldn't see it by the way they were situated. Agatha's face softened, and then a moment later, her posture did too. She seemed to just melt right into Rio's side, and it was something that she already knew she was going to miss.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been unrealistic to think that this day might never come, but hadn't most of their entire relationship been rather unrealistic, when it came down to it?
    </p>
<p>
     "You know you don't have to do that," Agatha murmured softly, her thumb still keeping its gentle pace over Rio's knuckles. "You don't have to feel obligated. I'm sure he'd be fine to go back to Dubai."
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Shh,"
     </i>
     Rio hushed her, turning her head so that she could place her lips to the crown of Agatha's. "I know I don't have to, but... they're getting on like a house on fire, and if he wants to stay, the option is there. Plus, who else is going to help me move these boxes over to the new house?"
    </p>
<p>
     This caused a gentle shake of laughter to take over Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're right, he
     <i>
      is
     </i>
     pretty useful for manual labor."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pressed another kiss to the top of Agatha's head before she removed the contact, straightening up. She was quiet for a moment, trapped in pensive thought. The silence wasn't unwelcome though, and felt rather warm over them. After another moment of thought, though, Rio spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "What can I do to make this easier for you?"
    </p>
<p>
     She turned to look at Agatha, but she had not been expecting the bewildered look she was receiving the moment their eyes met. A slight blush crept onto her cheeks from sheer embarrassment, even though she knew that there was really nothing to be embarrassed about. It was a genuine question, but it just seemed to have caught Agatha completely off guard.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm telling you that you have to stay here when we both know it's the last thing you want... and you're asking how you can make it easier on
     <i>
      me?"
     </i>
     The question wasn't sharp, but Agatha's disbelief was thick in her tone.
    </p>
<p>
     For a brief second, the thought made Rio sad. It wasn't a huge deal, at least not to her. However, Agatha seemed to be completely verklempt by the offer. Was it because no one had ever cared enough to ask her that question before? Was it because she was so used to people only needing her for what they wanted that it was so hard to believe someone would actually want to help in a tough time?
    </p>
<p>
     Sure, she was leaving. Rio knew, though, that she was not doing it by choice. More than that, Rio knew she would come back, or that she herself would go to Agatha when the waters were a little calmer. It wasn't an easy path to trek, but they were going to find their way somehow.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course I am," Rio stated simply, as though it were literally the most obvious thing in the world. "Because I love you."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's nervous expression seemed to dissolve the moment Rio's words touched her ears. It was clear she had been worried, and it was even more clear that this was one of the hardest things she'd had to do in quite sometime.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could have played it off, said that Agatha just wasn't ready to face her mother, but Rio knew the truth, no matter how conceited it sounded:
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was Agatha's comfort person, and they'd been together for nearly a solid two months, since the day Rio had turned up at Agatha's office. This was the first time, in two months, that she was going to have to navigate a very difficult situation without Rio by her side, and she was very obviously having a difficult time handling that.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted the hand that had been covering Agatha's and reached up, brushing her cheek lovingly with the backs of her knuckles.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know you can always call me. Hell, you can put me in an AirPod and do whatever you need to do, and I will sit in that very big office in that very big house while I work and just be there. If you need me to say something, or to talk to you, I will, but... I can still find ways to be with you when I'm not with you."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's throat tightened visibly toward the front of her neck, and Rio knew that she was just piling on the endless heap of things that Agatha had probably convinced herself she would never hear from the lips of another human being.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, Agatha, and I know you know this. What I don't think you know is what that
     <i>
      means."
     </i>
     Rio turned her hand, instead moving it to cradle Agatha's cheek in her palm. "What that means is that I'm going to always want to contribute to your quality of life. What that means is that when you cry, I don't judge you for it. When you're angry, I validate your feelings. When you're confused, we work toward an answer together. That's what I mean when I tell you that I love you. It's just a lot less to say," Rio added, her lips hiking up just enough at the corners to prove a warm smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, if you have to ride off into battle against your biggest foe, and I can't be there as back-up, then I'll be here as back-up instead. Point being, you still don't have to be alone, even if you're not right here with me."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been waiting; she'd watched them build, creating a glassy film over those blue eyes. Then, they had started to pool on the edges of her lids. As Rio finished speaking, though, Agatha blinked and the tears rolled down her cheeks, the one on her left side catching a roadblock in the form of Rio's hand.
    </p>
<p>
     Instantly, Rio was wiping it away with the pad of her thumb.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "There's that optimism again,"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured at her, turning her face into Rio's palm to place a light kiss against the flesh there.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Endlessly annoying, hm?"
     </i>
     she shot back, raising a playful eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
     For as resolute as she was being in this, Rio was scared, too. She had never known space like that between them since they'd been reunited, and the idea of being without Agatha, even though she knew she was still going to be loved and taken care of, it was one that brought with it a wave of anxiety.
    </p>
<p>
     As if listening in, Agatha spoke.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You don't have to do that when it's just us,"
     </i>
     she whispered, and Rio felt the sudden pang of familiarity in her chest. She'd heard those words before, but she had been the one saying them.
    </p>
<p>
     She felt like Agatha was looking straight through her, but she tried to fortify that facade as quickly as she could.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know what you're talking about." Rio's head turned and her eyes dropped to the floor, an immediate tell that she didn't want to have the conversation Agatha was trying to open the door to.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio, baby,"
     </i>
     Agatha crooned at her, reaching across her own body to gently hook Rio's chin into the crook of a curved finger. There was a brief moment where Rio tried to fight it, but she knew it was no use. Slumping, her head turned and she took in the sight of Agatha who looked like she wanted to burst into tears right along with her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't want to talk about it. Because I don't want you to feel guilty in any way. You're doing the right thing, and nothing I say will contribute to that way of thinking. Because..."
     </i>
     Rio stopped herself, pressing her lips together.
     <i>
      "Because selfishly, I hate this. I understand it, and I know you're protecting me, but I still hate it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio choked back her own tears, stuffing them down. She wasn't going to make this any harder on Agatha than she already was, but she knew that trying to hide her feelings would only wind up hurting Agatha more.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I hate that I have to sit here while you're six thousand miles away, going toe to toe with a woman who literally tried to kill you. I know she wouldn't dare try now, but..."
     </i>
     She took a breath, her lips worrying together for a moment before she found her voice again.
     <i>
      "This whole thing is a farce. It's a way for her to assert that she still has some form of control over your life, and I hate her for it. You deserve better, and you made better for yourself for thirty years."
     </i>
     Her voice had gained a little bit of strength, and it almost felt like she was a teenager again, trying to barter with her papa for something she did not want to give up.
     <i>
      "It's not fair that she just gets to march in and try to take it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She had still somehow managed to get through that entire little speech without shedding a single tear, but judging by the way Agatha was looking at her? Her efforts had to be painfully obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     "Listen," Agatha said back a little stronger, though her voice was still so very soft. "I'm not worried about this, or about her. I'll take a member of security with me to my lawyer's office."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blew a soft breath out, though there was a little force behind it. "She can't get to me at home, so when I'm not cleaning up this absolute shitshow, I'll be there. And I'll be on my laptop with your face across my screen as often as I can."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips twitched, the discomfort still heavy in her bones. She knew that Agatha was a grown woman, that she could take care of herself... But Rio liked taking care of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     With the gentlest show of force, Agatha pulled Rio closer by her chin, placing a soft kiss across her lips. She didn't try to further it, didn't try to push. It was just the most undemanding display of love, of adoration, and it was moving mountains within Rio's chest.
    </p>
<p>
     This was hard, and it was something that she was sure to complain about the entire time. She knew, though, that with the help of their children, it could at least be bearable. Rio knew that in her mind, she'd already gauged what Nicky's response was going to be; even if Rio wasn't the reason he chose to stay, she was almost confident he still would.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee and Tay? They'd always had each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had always been an only child.
    </p>
<p>
     It was his first time getting to spend time with people who treated him like an equal in the situation they'd all found themselves in. He'd already made it clear on quite a few occasions that the time difference made it easier for him to work, and that he quite enjoyed getting out of the Dubai heat. They were just little things, little ways for him to say that he wasn't ready to leave without him actually having to say it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio saw it, even if she didn't acknowledge it. She wouldn't ever box him in, but in the moments when he would say something goofy and Estee would ruffle his hair? It turned every drop of Rio's blood to magma, heating her from her middle out. They acted like siblings. They acted like this had been something they'd known their whole lives, even having grown up on two different ends of the world.
    </p>
<p>
     So, no. Rio was not worried that Nicky was going to hightail it the other direction when they had this conversation with the three of them.
    </p>
<p>
     As their lips parted, Rio tipped her head, her forehead landing just below Agatha's right eye as she heaved a frustrated sigh, though she tried to temper its severity. This wasn't Agatha's fault, and Rio didn't blame her, but she also would have done anything to see to it that this could happen differently.
    </p>
<p>
     She felt like a clingy child, but there was perhaps an underlying fear there that she was having a difficult time letting herself acknowledge.
    </p>
<p>
     The last time Rio had been alone, she had not been a fulfilled person. She'd had her purpose, had her reason in those two young woman she loved so dearly, but she had been so... alone. She had been numb to the idea of companionship. She found the idea of commitment laughable.
    </p>
<p>
     So, then, how was it going to feel when she was alone and none of that was true anymore?
    </p>
<p>
     Would she be able to handle an entirely new heartache of having to kiss Agatha goodbye for a yet undetermined amount of time? What was it going to feel like when, until the furniture arrived for the new house, she had to curl up in that bed on that houseboat alone, the smell of lilac and vanilla still in the pillows?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew it was useless to get caught up in the what-ifs, but she had never put herself in this position, and it was hard trying to determine how to navigate something that was so utterly unknown. She didn't know where she'd be able to find footing, but she had to stop thinking she couldn't. She wouldn't put that kind of guilt onto Agatha, she couldn't.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Can I just say..."
     </i>
     Rio whined, lifting her head to meet Agatha's gaze with her own panicked but warmed one.
     <i>
      "...one last time, that I really, really hate it?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha raised a hand, two fingers skimming along Rio's temple as she pushed her hair back, tucking a piece of it behind her ear. Those two fingers brushed over Rio's ear and pushed further, tangling into her dark locks. Agatha leaned forward, placing her lips to Rio's hairline just behind her right temple. And then, an inch over along the guideline of that hairline, she would place another, and another.
    </p>
<p>
     Much in a back and forth sweep, Agatha was literally kissing every inch of Rio's face she could get to, side to side and over again. By the time Agatha had made it most of the way down her cheeks, the tears had started to slip through closed eyelids. She knew what Agatha was doing: She was making a memory. She was giving Rio something to hold onto in the coming weeks.
    </p>
<p>
     She was making a mark.
    </p>
<p>
     As she reached the corner of Rio's mouth, she couldn't stay still, or wait another moment. Her head turned, catching Agatha's lips between her own fully.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been too many times to count that they had kissed.
    </p>
<p>
     None of them felt quite like that one, though.
    </p>
<p>
     This one was... desperate, but not in the way that they could hardly contain themselves. No, this desperation felt like a pit, like a very deep and very empty well. It was a dire need to say what no words ever could. It was a pouring of every bit of angst she was feeling over the entire situation. Rio knew that she needed to get a grip, that she needed to conduct herself a little bit better. How could she?
    </p>
<p>
     The Rio that sat there kissing Agatha like she needed to steal as much of her as she could to cling to in her absence had learned so much about herself in a mere two months. She had learned that it was okay to be spontaneous, that it was okay to do something uncomfortable because the end result was more than worth it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had taught Rio that she'd always been her own goddess, she'd just needed someone to hold up a mirror in front of her so she could see it clearly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew that she could not wonder about what it would be like when Agatha wasn't there to hold that reflection up. Instead, she had to take hold of the mirror.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha pulled their lips apart, there was no doubt in in Rio's mind that she was aware of the tears still spilling down her cheeks, especially gauging by her reaction. Agatha released all holds, but then slid one arm behind Rio's back and the other beneath her knees, using that incredible strength to lift Rio into her lap, tucking her into every bit of overhang she could manage.
    </p>
<p>
     It was funny, Rio thought. It almost felt like the compression of an anxiety blanket.
    </p>
<p>
     And it was working.
    </p>
<p>
     This moment was going to end. They were going to share their last meals together, and she was going to watch as Agatha walked away from her to get on a plane.
    </p>
<p>
     These were all facts.
    </p>
<p>
     But what she felt right then, with every bit of Agatha applying every bit of pressure she could, as if she would doing everything she could to hold Rio together?
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio felt was resolved.
    </p>
<p>
     If this was what she got at the end of their time apart?
    </p>
<p>
     It would be worth it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had let herself be held like that for over ten minutes, finally finding it within herself to force movement. Agatha's hold loosened, but she didn't let her go completely. She looked down at those breathtaking blue eyes and raised a hand, tracing the lightest line down the middle of Agatha's nose.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're going to be okay," Rio voiced, placing the tip of her index finger to Agatha's lips, which puckered in response.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know we are, baby. You just have know it too."
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The conversation with the kids had gone over as well as had been expected. None of them were thrilled but they all understood. But when Agatha had offered Nicky the option of joining her, going back to Dubai, or staying with the Vidals?
    </p>
<p>
     The ease with which the decision had come almost stole Rio's breath. He had been listening to the first two options with a dissatisfied downturn of his lips, but when presented with the third? His immediate focus shifted to Estee and Tay, as if to ask them if they would be okay if he chose that option. When he was met with shit-eating grins? His head whipped back to Rio, his green eyes wide with his question.
    </p>
<p>
     She had nodded her head and he had been so excited that it was almost infectious. He'd spent almost the rest of the night with a huge smile plastered to his face, and it touched something deep inside of Rio. He'd chosen to stay. Sure, he had his own reasons, but for Rio?
    </p>
<p>
     For Rio, Nicky was the piece of Agatha she would get to hold onto.
    </p>
<p>
     When they woke the next morning, Agatha had an email from Dave that contained her tickets and itinerary for her flight that was due to depart that afternoon, and it had all become even more real.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had clung to that resolve, though. She knew that she could get through this, because she had their kids. She had those three beautiful, bright, incredible kids, and they were going to get her through this. She had not a single doubt about that.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd spent most of the day in bed, a little more than thankful that the kids had taken the hint and decided to go out for a bit. With Estee in therapy, her mobility had been improving and so they had declared they were going to spend some time at the beach.
    </p>
<p>
     For Rio and Agatha, it was their last chance to feel that physical closeness. That morning had been filled with nothing but love, but passion and affection. It was warm skin, soft laughs all wrapped up in a tangle of sheets.
    </p>
<p>
     They had gotten out of bed to shower and Rio had helped Agatha with packing her things, offering things she knew Agatha would otherwise forget.
    </p>
<p>
     Walking into that airport, hand in hand, had Rio on the verge of throwing up. She asserted again to herself that this was something she was capable of doing, that it was something she knew she could do but only because she had to. It was currently the absolute bane of her existence, but it was going to be alright, with time.
    </p>
<p>
     They reached the partitioned off part of the TSA line and stopped, turning to face one another. Immediately, Agatha let go of her suitcase and pulled Rio into her arms in one of the strongest hugs Rio had ever gotten from her. And then, like a whisper in the night, she could hear it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      We've got this.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was Agatha's voice in the back of her head, and it rang with certainty.
    </p>
<p>
     They clung like that for as long as Agatha's impending flight would allow, finally pulling apart despite the fact that it was the last thing either of them wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     With minimal space between them, Agatha's hand raised and cradled Rio's jaw with ease, pulling her in for an urgent but tender kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Their lips parted, foreheads pressed together, and Agatha's whisper landed somewhere in the middle of Rio's chest.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you more than you know. Any time you doubt that, you give me a call, okay?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Another stolen peck.
    </p>
<p>
     A sad, soft chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I plan to be in your ear always. I... I love you too, Agatha. And... I'm really going to miss you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's smile was gentle, but it was also reassuring.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know, because I'm going to miss you, too. But... I can think of at least three people who are going to make it easier on you, if you let them."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're stalling, Agatha."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "I am."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha gave one more gentle tug on Rio's jaw, placing their lips together in one kiss that hummed with a sense of finality, no matter how much Rio hated it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you, Rio. I'll message you as soon as I land."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio drew in a slow breath, willing back the sting in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you too, Agatha. Be careful. And... call whenever you need."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "You can count on it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stole one last peck, and though she turned and began her journey back to America, Rio had not missed the anguish in her eyes for that one brief moment, and she did everything she could not to let it sink her like a stone.
    </p>
<p>
     It was going to be okay.
    </p>
<p>
     It had to be okay.

       I've been sitting here trying to figure out:
       <br/>
       What did I do right to be with you right now?
      </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     Rio knew the path to follow; it was clearly marked and had visible red 'EXIT' signs with indicative arrows dotted every so often along the walls. Rio knew where she was going. She'd done this many times with Estee. So why did it feel like such a hard path to follow? Despite keeping her faculties as she tried to get back to the garage, the acute sense of panic was very quickly welling in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Somehow, though it took her far longer than it should have, Rio reached the car and poured herself into it. Impressively, she had not let another tear fall until the moment that car door slammed shut.
    </p>
<p>
     Half-way into Rio's very first sob, her phone began to ring.
    </p>
<p>
     She sniffled, her brow knitting as she struggled a bit to get her phone out of her pocket. That crease in her forehead seemed to only deepen as she produced it to see a photo of herself and Agatha across the screen, Agatha's little profile photo, and her name. They were all three indicators that Agatha was, indeed, calling her.
    </p>
<p>
     Snapping out of her trance, she swiped the answer button over and nearly slammed the phone against her ear, unable to hide the anxiety in her voice as she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha!? Are you okay?"
    </p>
<p>
     It was almost panicked, as if something could have gone wrong in the twenty minutes it had apparently taken her to get to the car.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's subjective but... Are you?"
    </p>
<p>
     In that moment, Rio's heart both wanted to beat out of her chest and also completely stop at the same time. Agatha's voice was warm, as always, but her question was worried. She could just
     <i>
      hear
     </i>
     in Rio's own voice that something was off, and Rio had never felt so seen when no one was looking at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I'll be fine. Is everything okay? What happened?" Rio was asking questions, trying to decide what the crisis was that Agatha had called her so soon.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio, Rio," came Agatha's soothing tones, only causing more tears to prick at the backs of Rio's eyes. Why did she sound so understanding?
    </p>
<p>
     That answer was obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     No one else in the world but Agatha could understand what Rio was feeling right then, because she was sitting half a mile away feeling the exact same way.
    </p>
<p>
     "Baby, nothing's wrong. I'm at the gate waiting. I just... couldn't get on that plane without hearing your voice up until the last minute."
    </p>
<p>
     Hotter and faster, the tears escalated from a stream to a heavy pour. They dropped off of the line of her jaw, dotting her olive scoop neck and chest. She knew it was stupid, she knew that she shouldn't be crying, but she was at a point where she was looking at fractured glimpses of her life and knowing that she had to put those pieces back into place if she was going to be able to keep going.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, hey... Rio, it's okay."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tucked her face into her free elbow, trying to remember what it meant to take even breaths.
    </p>
<p>
     In for four. Hold for four. Out for four. Hold for four.
    </p>
<p>
     Repeat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been quiet, knowing what was happening on the other end of that line, but as Rio's whimpers grew quiet, Agatha's voice came over that line. It was every bit of the deliverance she had intended it to be.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you. I love you. I
      <b>
       love
      </b>
      you. And I am already on my way to coming back, because every minute I'm gone is a minute I'm closer to seeing you again."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That logic could have been so broken, so picked apart if Rio had wanted to put any kind of effort into the act. She didn't. She wanted to hear what Agatha was telling her over what words she used. Yes, she was leaving, but every step she took toward what awaited her in Los Angeles was a step that was the beginning of the circular path she was about to take, every step a step closer to home.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you too, Agatha. I'm... sorry. I'm not trying to make this harder on you, because I know that's what I'm doing. I just... thought maybe I could have a car breakdown. And bed breakdown. And shower breakdown. You know, all of that, before I got to hear your voice again."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was soft, but she could hear Agatha's soft chuckle over the line.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I took an Ativan the second I sat down. I am going to sleep the entire time as to avoid a very public plane breakdown, so I get it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     This made Rio relax. That poor woman was sitting alone in an airport, tossing back anti-anxiety medication to try and sedate herself enough to sleep through the misery of doing something she didn't want to do. Was it gut-wrenching? Of course. But was it also touching? Without question.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was quiet for a few long moments, just listening to the bustle of the airport in the background of the line. Her lips twisted for a moment in pained thought before she found the right words.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you..." she hesitated, biting roughly into her bottom lip. "Do you have anyone else in LA, besides Wanda?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was quiet, stunned by Rio's question. It was clearly a ploy to build a support net on Rio's end, but it was a little louder than that, too.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean... I could go spend time with Jack and his girlfriend, if you absolutely insisted on it in opposition to hiding in the house. They're just younger and it makes me feel so
     <i>
      old
     </i>
     sometimes." Agatha's voice still had this little tinge, the tiniest and sharpest edge of anxiety. Rio could almost hear the panic she had unintentionally incited by forcing Agatha into the realization that she should probably tend to her life outside of all of this in what ways she could.
    </p>
<p>
     "And I know if I call Wanda, she'll turn up with a handle of gin and we will drink and I will probably fight myself on not crying because some part of her still thinks I'm a giant hard-ass." Rio could hear that Agatha was using humor to deflect, and so instead of pointing that out, she just let it happen. What harm would it do to let Agatha have that outlet?
    </p>
<p>
     A soft sigh over crackled static.
    </p>
<p>
     "I just don't have any desire to be in anyone else's company. That might change, but as of right now..."
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha."
     </i>
     It was firm, even in its tenderness. "I know how you feel. But in the same way I'm going to need to throw the moments I can't have with you into time spent with our children, you need that, too." Rio took in a slow breath, wondering if she was toeing a line she shouldn't be by saying what she wanted to. "And I know you run a tight ship, and you're not fond of having friends. But... the ones you do have? Let them help."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could almost hear the indignation, the utter dissatisfaction, as it bubbled up in Agatha's chest. They were so close, but so far away, and the distance was only going to grow.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could bring herself to words, it sounded: the boarding call.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt her throat pitch forward, but she kept herself quiet. This was hard enough as it was, on both of them, and she didn't need to go breaking both of their hearts before Agatha walked onto that plane.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mi amor,"
     </i>
     Rio murmured at her, and the way Agatha's breath caught was audible.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had never called her that before.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Te amo más que a nada.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She heard the smallest sniffle over the noise of the other line, and she fought to not let it sink her. She could see the look on Agatha's face without having to look at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll see you, my love."
    </p>
<p>
     This time, it was Rio's turn to try and stifle the sound that wanted to escape her. It was clear that Agatha had asked Estee what their parting exchange meant, and Estee had probably told her, all too eagerly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, somehow and somewhere not within her own body, found her resolve.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, Agatha. I'll talk to you when you land."
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you too, Rio."
    </p>
<p>
     And with the dull brrm brrm that indicated the call had been terminated, Rio stared down at her phone, which was now her wallpaper.
    </p>
<p>
     That wallpaper was chaos contained in a single photo.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the one that Nicky had taken the night they'd all gone to the lava caves on Rangitoto. They'd ended up on the beach while waiting for their ferry, and he had insisted on taking it.
    </p>
<p>
     He'd had the longest arms, but the way he had contorted himself to make sure everyone was visible was almost obvious in the image. His head was ducked and cocked back to the side, Tay coming around his side with Estee's mega-watt smile in the space between them. And there, behind them, were the matriarchs of their little family. They hadn't even been aware at the time that he had been taking it, and it showed. Agatha was facing the camera, but she was looking up at Rio, who was stood with her front pressed to Agatha's side.
    </p>
<p>
     The way they were looking at each other?
    </p>
<p>
     That was what artwork could be when the world happened and they weren't paying attention because what was in front of them was, at that second, the most important thing in their purview.
    </p>
<p>
     That photo was the essence of their family.
     <i>
      Theirs.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Not once since the blending could Rio even recall when the terms 'my son' or 'my girls' were ever used between the two of them. It was always just...
     <i>
      the kids.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     And now, Rio was the one left to hold down the fort. She knew that out of the four of them, she was undoubtedly going to be the one who fell under the category of being most fragile, but she felt the need to show up for them, too. She felt the need to remain present, even though half of her was going to be on an entirely different continent.
    </p>
<p>
     Minutes passed, two turning into five and five turning into ten. By the time even that doubled? Rio knew she had to go back home, back to their children.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, she managed to convince herself to start the car and drive back to the marina. She had taken a few more moments to try and build up that brave facade and, with intent, pulled in a long and slow breath, braving her way back into the house.
    </p>
<p>
     As she removed the key from the lock and pushed the door open, there was never any reality where she could have expected what was waiting on the other side.
    </p>
<p>
     Everything in the main living area had been pushed to the outskirts of the room and two mattresses were side by side on the floor, covered in a plethora of blankets and quilts that Rio knew came from the linen closet. All three kids were sat near the tops of them, their backs pressed to the front of the couch. There were bags of candy and chips (which most of were notably Rio's favorites, and some of Agatha's) and even a neatly tied bag that bore the logo of their favorite chip shop.
    </p>
<p>
     For the umpteenth time that day, Rio's tears were hot and streaming before she could even consider any reaction to keep them checked.
    </p>
<p>
     Those three beautiful souls knew what this entire situation meant, and what it was going to feel like for the two women they respectively loved in their lives. They wanted to show up for the parent they had with them.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Y-you..."
     </i>
     Rio forced out, though it was all that came through for a moment.
     <i>
      "You guys did this for me?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She had been expecting Estee to speak first, or maybe even Tay, but Nicky's voice sounded before all else.
    </p>
<p>
     "We thought that maybe tonight was a good night for fish n' chips, too much junk food, and... some movies." With this, Nicky's lips turned up in a sheepish manner, but Estee cut in.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know if
     <i>
      you've
     </i>
     ever told her, but I know that the only three films you've seen that aren't documentaries are Fried Green Tomatoes, Night Mother and Delores Claiborne." Estee raised a hand, indicating the several DVDs laying on the bed in front of her. "So, we're having a Harkness movie marathon."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips twisted in a mixture of anxiety and gratitude, and she was having an incredibly difficult time finding a way to let them blend in peace.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee gave Tay's leg a soft tap of request, and Tay was quick on her feet to help her girlfriend up. While she was able to hold weight and walk for short periods, Estee still needed help every now and again. She limped her way over and did not hesitate to take her mother's face in both of her hands, looking her directly in the eye.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's what they're for, mama. She wanted to give people the chance to live in her head for a couple of hours at a time. So... that's where we'll stay, for now."
    </p>
<p>
     With caution to her still-fragile physical state, Rio instantly reached up, pulling her daughter into her arms in a tight hug, though she somehow managed the feat of not letting another tear spill. These kids that they had raised? They were good fucking kids.
    </p>
<p>
     They had untangled and set about their evening, the four of them sat hip to hip across both mattresses, propped up against the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky. Rio. Estee. Tay. In that order.
    </p>
<p>
     When Nicky had sat himself next to her, even going as far to lean into her the slightest bit? Again, it was another struggle in fighting tears, but she managed to gain the upper hand that time.
    </p>
<p>
     The first film was Estee's pick and honestly? Rio wasn't sure what she had been expecting, but an entire character exploration on one woman's journey from losing her family in a selfish tragedy, into the marines, and back out into civilian life after an honorable discharge? The film was heavier on the latter bit of that, following the woman -- Athena, she had been named -- as she relied on the friends she had left to help her learn what it meant to process grief instead of running from it. It had been beautifully well done; the dialogue was pointed and direct, but there was this sense of care about each line that had been delivered. The acting had been incredible as well, but Rio found herself several times pointing out, in her own mind, the most obvious pieces of Agatha that no one seemed to be aware of.
    </p>
<p>
     The second, as the lights were turned off and the snack bags were opened, was about two friends who, through the shots of stolen glances and the superb acting choices, were clearly in love. The friendship moniker was something they'd brandished, though. Leaving a meal that celebrated Vivian's -- an EMT in the story -- first in-ambulance delivery, the two women stumbled on an attack, leaving Vivian to jump into action. Her best friend, Marley, could only watch as one wrong tackle ended the attacker's life, and a whole slew of problems happened for Vivian. There were elements of romance, of heartache, of courtroom showings as Vivian's life was held in the balance. The declaration of love between the two main characters in an empty room between lawyer meetings, it had struck something in Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn't just think about the things she put into her films. She
     <i>
      felt
     </i>
     them.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time the second one had finished, both of the girls were fast asleep on their sides, two waves washing into the tides of sleep together.
    </p>
<p>
     She had not been expecting Nicky to have stayed away, but as the credits began to roll, he turned his head toward her, that sweet little curl of his lips so present. "Do you want to watch another?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's face softened and in a move that was a little too out of character, she raised her arm across her own body, reaching up to cup Nicky's cheek in her palm. Her lips turned down at the corners, pressed into the tightest line. She was trying to vault her emotions at what that simple question had meant to her. It wasn't what he said, it was what he meant.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I think I'm going to go to bed, kid. But..."
     </i>
     Affectionately, her thumb brushed his cheek.
     <i>
      "Thank you. For staying, for what you have with them..."
     </i>
     she voiced, tilting her chin toward the girls for a moment.
     <i>
      "But most of all, thank you for giving your mom another chance."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Nicky's own lips pressed, his teeth barely visible as he sunk his them into the bottom one. Rio could have even put her hand on her chest and sworn that she saw his eyes grow glassy.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Thank you, Rio, for helping her find the woman I always knew she could be."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In tandem, both sets of cheeks were suddenly wet and Rio moved with a hurried necessity as she adjusted so that she could pull Nicky into her arms in a ferociously tight hug, her body rocking them side-to-side gently. After a few minutes, her hold loosened, but she tilted her face toward that mess of wild hair and placed a kiss softly to the top of his head.
    </p>
<p>
     She let him go completely and got to her feet, taking one last look down at him.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Goodnight, sweet boy."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Goodnight Rio. If it's too hard... there's room for you out here, too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She gave him a tight smile that was a complete disguise for her absolute need to completely crumble in that moment. On what felt like shaky legs, she carried herself toward the bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't sure when it happened, only that it had. It had stopped being Rio's bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     It was their bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     And there were traces of Agatha all through it, like debris left after a whirlwind of a storm. Her bottles of hair product on the vanity, her perfume on her nightstand -- something she had explicitly left for Rio -- and her varying shades of purple blouses hanging in the closet.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio drew in a steadying breath and marched ever forward, sliding into bed on the side that was not typically her own.
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment -- maybe one full second -- it almost felt like falling into Agatha. The sheets were not quite as soft as her skin, and the scent of her was still on her pillow, but then with a wash of disappointing realization, it hit Rio that it just wasn't the same.
    </p>
<p>
     The tears had come, but the shaking had been kept at bay. She could still cry, still feel upset over missing what the universe was telling her she could not have right now. What she could also do, though, was pull herself out of bed the next morning, make their family breakfast, and find ways to fill her time.
    </p>
<p>
     That had been one of the last few thoughts she'd had before she'd exhausted herself to slumber, wrapped up in every bit of Agatha that she could manage.
    </p>
<p>
     As one eye flew open in the dark, Rio could instantly hear the buzzing of her phone on her nightstand, though she screen was face down. She didn't need to see who it was. A hand leapt from under the covers and she snapped her phone to her ear as she answered it. Before she could even spit her greeting, she heard Agatha's voice.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hey, my love."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In an instant, Rio's heart was lodged in her chest, even though she wanted to shout back how happy she was to hear that sound.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Good morning, baby,"
     </i>
     Rio crooned groggily at her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know it's early there, but I wanted to tell you that I landed. Dave had the car waiting, so I'm on my way home."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Not the right one, though,"
     </i>
     Rio murmured back, though there was a lightness in her tone that indicated it was more playful than it was anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha blew out a huff loud enough that Rio could hear, causing her lips to turn down in guilt.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I just meant... I'm sorry,"
     </i>
     she voiced back.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's alright, baby. I realize I woke you up, but I told you I'd let you know when I got here and I always keep my word. Why don't you go back to sleep? I'll call you later on."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agathaaaaa,"
     </i>
     Rio whined, her face still half buried in the pillow.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yes?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "I miss you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The silence wasn't awkward, but it was heavy. Rio didn't think for a second that Agatha was going to leave it unacknowledged. Instead, she was letting it process and trying to determine the respectively correct output.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "My heart doesn't beat the same when you're not around."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Damn her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "My sad poet, I think you may need a nap."
     </i>
     Rio's voice was soft, but it was melodious in its delivery.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I miss you, too. And I love you. We're pulling up to the house now, but we'll talk more after we've both had a little more rest."
     </i>
     Something Rio was noticing that that while there was still a tepid touch to Agatha's tone, it had started to shy away from any actual form of warmth.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm sorry this is something you have to do. But... you have people there. Use them. Or I will make Nicky give me contact information and I'll order them to come steal you away to keep your mind busy."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's laugh came over the line and Rio's heart soared for the first time since she'd let her go in that airport.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Plus... You can always be an Athena Saltzman. You know, actually choosing to rely on others in really hard times."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a sharp breath and the strangest noise sounded, if Rio had to guess, somewhere near the base of her throat.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio Daniela Vidal,"
     </i>
     Agatha nearly hissed at her and it had the grin on her face nearly cracking her apart.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yes, my love?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "You didn't..."
     </i>
     Rio could hear the flooding as it built, could feel that raw emotion clawing within Agatha's chest. She knew what that meant to Agatha, even without her having to say it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It was the kids' idea. I showed up and they had crisps and lollies and they got dinner from the chip shop. When I sat down, they just... swarmed me. We ate, we drank wine and we just... lived in your head for a little while."
     </i>
     Her voice was still soft, but there was a little more conviction there, a sense of resolve that Rio had only found in those hours spent with their kids.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Gods be damned, I fucking hate my mother."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was a truthful statement, but it was one Rio could not have agreed with anymore. Sure, they would have eventually gone back to LA, but they could have either done it together, or as a family. They could have had a good time, had the chance to show the kids some of the things that Agatha had shown to her on her first trip. They could have had the chance to make memories.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So scare the God out of her and come back home to us."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio wanted so badly to be on the other end of that phone, to be right next to the woman she loved, to know what was going on in those eyes and on that face as she sat in silence. She heard movement, as Agatha climbed out of the car and shut the door behind her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm going to do my damnedest. I just got to the house, my love. Go back to sleep, I'll FaceTime you later, hm?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio grumbled in response, though the thought of a few more hours of shut eye didn't sound like the worst one. Still, doing that meant hanging up the phone and cutting off any chance she might get to hear Agatha speak again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio?"
     </i>
     she beguiled, unsure if her request had already worked.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Okay, okay. Fine. I will sleep, and then make breakfast. And then I will sit on our deck trying not to stare at the bridge while I read."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha exhaled a laugh that almost turned into a snort. "You know that the moment -- okay, maybe not
     <i>
      the
     </i>
     moment -- that I get home, we're planning the wedding, right?"
    </p>
<p>
     A rapid fluttering happened in Rio's chest, her stomach squeezing in the utter delight it brought to her at hearing Agatha say something like that. She exhaled her own light giggle, a truly amused sound.
    </p>
<p>
     "I would expect no less, my love. Now go!" Rio chided, her tone sweet but sincere. Her next words were softer, but they were still indicative of how she was feeling. "And if you miss me too much, I'm pretty sure that I forgot my All Blacks kit somewhere in the closet the night we left. I bet it would look good on you."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sucked in a breath, but exhaled it heavily a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll let you be the judge of that. I love you, beautiful. Quit stalling."
    </p>
<p>
     Another light giggle zipped across the line, right into Agatha's ear.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you too, mi amor. And if I don't wake up to a picture of you in that kit, I might be a little disappointed."
    </p>
<p>
     "Dually noted, sweetheart. I'll see you later, yeah?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Not soon enough."

       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     Rio had decided with absolute certainty that her least favorite thing had now become hanging up a phone when Agatha was the one on the other line. It was painful, though not debilitatingly so. However, it was still a stark reminder that they were half a world apart, that they couldn't just walk into the next room to see the other.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's one true home was across an ocean and the painful reminder hit her every single time that line went dead and she was left alone again.
    </p>
<p>
     She missed Agatha. She hadn't even been gone a whole day.
    </p>
<p>
     She had tried to heed Agatha's instruction, but sinking back into the bed had not provided any relief. She couldn't stop thinking about her, thinking about how much of life they had experienced since the day they'd met. They had witnessed so much and felt so much, and it had only ever bonded them. Their experiences had bound them together in a way that had been subtle, and now?
    </p>
<p>
     Well, now their ties were very visible in that diamond on Rio's left hand. She turned her head on the pillow, her right cheek finding the soft cotton as she raised her hand to take it in.
    </p>
<p>
     Every time she looked at it, the breath in her throat often got swallowed down. It was so... perfect. When she'd had more time to look at it, to study it? It was almost like she could pinpoint every single reason that Agatha had picked it. The divots in the metal looked like leaves, the curling of the halo of smaller diamonds that looked like rose petals. Agatha had gone on a hunt until she found the perfect trophy to bring home and Rio could not have been more flattered.
    </p>
<p>
     They were going to get married. That was still a thought, however much of an astonished one it was. Sure, there was no date, nothing set in stone. But hearing Agatha say that to her, that the planning began when she came home?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had never so much been in a serious relationship, and there she had been discussing planning a wedding with a woman she had known for just over two months. In the grand scheme of things, it had to seem insane. She knew it did. Nicky's initial reaction had been all too indicative of that. He had been the voice of what was probably the entire world if anyone else had known about the situation.
    </p>
<p>
     It should have terrified her, but something she had learned in the last two months?
    </p>
<p>
     When it came to Agatha, the only thing she had to worry about was her ability to walk after they'd been fucking like teenagers for hours.
    </p>
<p>
     What an incredible form of safety: Rio had shut the world out for her protection, only to fork over every last bit of her reserves to someone who handled them with intent and care. Agatha could have easily wrecked her, even on that first day, by saying that night on the boat hadn't meant anything. Instead, she had embraced Rio with a wild fervor that Rio had never seen present in another human being.
    </p>
<p>
     For as often as she had thought in their absence that she had been insane for feeling the way she had, the moment their lips had touched at the foot of those stairs, Agatha holding onto her face like that?
    </p>
<p>
     Soulmates, past lives, seeking faith. Everything they were happened in that one moment, they just hadn't realized it.
    </p>
<p>
     The longer Rio lay there, the more she realized that she was not going to find a way to go back to sleep. A tongue swiped over dry lips and she let out a soft sigh, not wanting to move to her own side of the bed to retrieve her chapstick. Instead, she opened the drawer of Agatha's nightstand and peeked her head over to peer inside. As she rummaged, a yellow Post-it note was revealed only by the corner and there was a slight line that formed in Rio's brow.
    </p>
<p>
     Carefully, she pulled on it, and when she saw what was on it? Her face crumpled and the tears started welling in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     There, on that little square of paper, was a poorly drawn boat on rocky waves. Next to it was Rio's scrawl; her name and phone number.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hadn't even been aware that the note had ever been passed onto Agatha, especially after they'd had their little reckoning outside of that office. What was more, Agatha had kept it with her in the same way Rio still had that purple Post-it with Agatha's message from their first time together.
    </p>
<p>
     There was something to be done with that, Rio supposed, but that would be a project for another day.
    </p>
<p>
     She found a tube of chapstick in Agatha's drawer and applied it to her lips before she tossed it back inside and shut the drawer. Rio wanted to throw herself back into the pillows, to just wrap up in the ghost of Agatha a little bit longer, but the sun had been steadily rising and she knew that there was no point.
    </p>
<p>
     In contradiction to what her mind wanted, she forced herself up and swung her legs over the edge of the bed. Her palms pressed flat to the mattress on either side of her as she brought the morning into focus, her eyes drifting over to the closet. Agatha's shirts were still hung and it caused Rio's lips to rub together in choice.
    </p>
<p>
     After another moment of thought, she pushed herself to her feet and padded over to the closet, thumbing through her fiancée's clothes. Through all of the different shades of purple, though, there was something that caught Rio's attention that she had never noticed before.
    </p>
<p>
     Almost like it was hidden, there was a t-shirt in the back. Unlike the other hues, this one was a vibrant cardinal color. How had she never noticed it before? She reached forward, pulling the hanger off of the pole, and turned it around to face her.
    </p>
<p>
     Emblazoned on the front in big gold letters: "USC Trojans." Between the words, there was a small logo of a Trojan warrior. Rio was completely confounded. She didn't understand what the insignia meant, but she was curious. With the hanger still curled safely in her grip, she crossed back to the bed and pulled up her phone, inputting the words into Google.
    </p>
<p>
     When the results came across her screen? Rio simply blinked down at her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha liked college football?
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't even go to USC.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had to like collegiate American football. And for some reason? It felt like to Rio, she had just learned an entirely new side of who Agatha was, fundamentally. It was silly, surely, but the fact that Rio got these chances to learn more and more about this woman she loved each and every day? She was thankful.
    </p>
<p>
     Each piece she gathered, helped her build something bigger and better. Each new fasten she could gather secured their bind a little more. There were so many staples to Agatha that Rio knew she'd have some time to find how they all fit, and where they went. This was just another piece of that.
    </p>
<p>
     Then again, should Rio be
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     surprised? After all, she did know how much Agatha loved rugby, and she supposed American football was... diet rugby. Rio didn't exactly understand all of the rules, and it felt like quite a bit to grasp onto, but it was entertaining enough to watch with no context.
    </p>
<p>
     That struck a thought in her.
    </p>
<p>
     Her All Blacks kit.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's Trojan's shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment the idea formed, Rio's lips curled into a smirk. She laid the shirt down on the bed and pulled off her own before she gave a little stretch to loosen some tension in her back. She made quick work of removing the t-shirt off of the hanger and slid it over her head, her legs still bare from the hem of the shirt down.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had started to move to find a pair of shorts, but then... another thought.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned back to the bed and scooped up her phone, making her way over to the full-length mirror that was in the corner. Seeing her reflection made her grin. She was missing Agatha, yes, but she had so many pieces to hold onto.
    </p>
<p>
     She brought up the phone, positioning it just right so that her grin was still visible as was the rest of her in her entirety, clad in nothing but that t-shirt and her underwear that weren't even visible beneath the edge of the shirt. Rio snapped the picture, and then another where she was chewing on her thumbnail.
    </p>
<p>
     When she was satisfied with the product, she stood there, composing a message to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know you're probably sleeping, but I couldn't. So... I went through your things. ;)"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio included the two photos she had taken in the message and sent it. With the knowledge that a response would likely not come for a while, she decided to start the day. She found a pair of shorts and slid them on, making her way out into the living room. Her eyes fell on the mattress, but as she did a head count, a kid was missing.
    </p>
<p>
     Her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head tilted back to look down the hallway behind her, but the bathroom door was open and Estee's mattress was one of the ones on the floor, so she wouldn't be in her room. Rio's brow pulled slightly, but she paced to the door that led to the deck, pulling it open as opposed to trying to look through the blinds.
    </p>
<p>
     There, sat in the chair that Rio always tended to occupy, was Estee, her gaze up and to the right of where she sat. There was this look on her face that Rio couldn't quite place; she looked contemplative, yes, but there were these brief licks of pain that seized certain spots in her face every so often. She had been so absorbed in whatever thoughts she was having that she had not heard Rio open the door.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mija? Estas bien?" Rio's voice was low and soft, but it was full of her concern.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's eyes snapped over to her mother, the surprise taking over her form. When she processed the question, she gave a gentle nod. "I'm just..." She stopped, those beautiful eyes filling with an emotion Rio had not seen in her before. "Just thinking, that's all."
    </p>
<p>
     The dismissal flagged something in Rio's mind. Her lips worried together for a moment, but then her feet were moving as she moved over to the other chair -- Agatha's chair -- and placed herself into it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thinking about what?" Rio posed, looking over at her daughter's profile. That little slope of her nose that ended in the cutest curve, those perfectly placed cheekbones. Even through Rio's own bias, she knew that Estee was a beautiful young woman, no matter who was looking at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's too early for that conversation," she attempted to dismiss, but she knew before she said it that Rio was not going to let it fly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Estrella."
    </p>
<p>
     Even though she didn't move to look at her mother, Rio could still see it. Her lips pinched down at the corner and her eyes filled with emotion. She could also see Estee's throat bob as she tried to swallow that emotion down.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... It's just that... It's always just been you and me and Tay, and that's been perfect. That is all we have ever needed. I didn't need another parent because I had all I needed in you." Estee's voice was low, but Rio could hear the sincerity, and it touched her. She could feel the emotion beginning to wash into her chest, too. With a fight, she shoved it back down to let Estee say what she had to say.
    </p>
<p>
     "But mama?" she voiced, turning her head to take Rio in, one of the tears breaking free to slip down her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, mija?"
    </p>
<p>
     "It's hard when Agatha's not here."
    </p>
<p>
     The tears in Rio's own eyes that had been sitting, held back by her own will, slipped down her cheeks soundlessly. Gods, if that wasn't the honest fucking truth.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know, mija. And here I was thinking I was going to be the only one to struggle," she mused, breathing a sad chuckle through a tight smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "Honestly, I thought you were, too. And... yes, I hate seeing you without her because I know you're struggling... But my reasons are a little more selfish." She paused, her eyes landing somewhere in the water in front of them. "When I woke up in the hospital, I thought I was dreaming. I mean, a member of Hollywood royalty was sitting beside my bed, holding my hand. I never could have imagined that you, or her, would ever have been there." Estee reached up, wiping at her wet cheeks. She took in a long, slow breath and then exhaled before she spoke again. "When I looked into her eyes? I felt safe. I felt like even though it wasn't you, she was going to protect me until you got back."
    </p>
<p>
     The longer Estee went on, the hotter and faster Rio's tears fell even though she did not make a single sound.
    </p>
<p>
     "I've never wanted to admit it to you, but I sometimes had thoughts -- mostly as a kid -- where I wondered what it would be like to have two moms, or a mom and a dad. The older I got the more I realized it didn't matter... but the way Agatha treated me that day? The nine-year-old in me had wanted it to be someone like... Not, not someone like her. It would have killed to have
     <i>
      her
     </i>
     as that second parent."
    </p>
<p>
     This was tearing at Rio, clawing at her in a way that was too scarily reminiscent of what she had felt that day she'd laid eyes on Nicky in that hotel lobby. She took a calming breath, though, and tried to center herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's just the timing. I wish that you could have had her this whole time. And her not being around... Well, it just sucks."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached across the table, laying her palm on the top of Estee's forearm, giving a gentle squeeze before she began to brush the skin there with her thumb.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know, mija. But we're going to get through it. Not only because we have to, but because we can."
    </p>
<p>
     As Estee finally looked over at her, a curious look wove into her expression. "Mama, what are you wearing?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked down at the shirt, then back up to Estee. A grin pushed up wet cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's Agatha's. It's an American football team, I guess. We were talking about my All Blacks kit when she called me to tell her that she was safe and back in LA. I had ended up thumbing through her things because I missed her and I found this in the back. Thought it a bit fitting, hm?" Rio posed, tilting her head sweetly in Estee's direction.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's almost gross how much you love each other," Estee offered back, her tears seeming to have dried.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio offered her a sunny smile and tip of her head, a silent acknowledgment.
    </p>
<p>
     They were quiet for a moment, both pairs of eyes cast out into the water. The silence rippled apart at the sound of Estee's voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nick mentioned wanting to go somewhere he could get some good photos, so Tay and I decided we're going to take him to Cape Reinga. We'll probably end up getting a hotel room up there since it's such a drive." The way Estee delivered this to her with such ease was warming in every way imaginable. "If we leave by 10, we can get there no later than 16:00, which will give him plenty of time to set up for sunset photos."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a laugh that caught Estee, and honestly even herself, off guard. The question in those green eyes was apparent, but Rio's smile never wavered.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's almost gross how much you guys all love each other," Rio parroted back, her grin splitting her lips smoothly.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead of protesting, Estee simply gave her shoulders a shrug, turning her eyes back out before them.
    </p>
<p>
     "I've always loved Tay for as long as I can remember. She's never been a sibling figure through my worldview, no matter how many times I said she was my sister. But Nick? He just...
     <i>
      feels
     </i>
     like a brother. He cares like one, he acts like one. He's so kind and does so much to just make our lives easier. So, I guess I just want to return the favor."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave Estee's arm another gentle squeeze. "I'm happy that you have that, mija."
    </p>
<p>
     "Me too, mama."
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, I'll go in and start breakfast. Crumpets and eggs sound alright?"
    </p>
<p>
     Estee gave a small nod as she looked back over at her mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "Te amo, mama."
    </p>
<p>
     "Te amo, mija. Come in when you're ready, and if you need help, just give a shout."
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had done as she had said, cooking the four of them breakfast which finished right around the same time that Nicky and Tay greeted the morning. They'd all eaten with a documentary about the dodo that Nicky had randomly selected, more background noise than anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     Afterward, Rio cleaned up the dishes while the kids packed their bags for their trip that was likely to roll into the next day. As they departed, she'd kissed both Estee and Tay on the cheek, who each returned the favor when the embraces broke apart. When she hugged Nicky, though, she hadn't been expecting to place the lightest brush of his lips over her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     It caused this pit to form in Rio, one that made her miss Agatha but made her love Nicky at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     "You three behave. Call if you need anything. And please, please, please. Be careful."
    </p>
<p>
     They had all announced, almost in perfect unison, that they would, and disappeared toward the parking lot to load up Tay's car, slow going to keep pace with Estee.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned back to the empty home and she was hit with a realization.
    </p>
<p>
     Not only was this her first time here alone since the day Agatha had fallen into her life, but that thought did not make her sad. Did it fill her with longing? Absolutely. But... The houseboat had always been her refuge, and now with a piece of Agatha hanging around her torso, she felt oddly at peace.
    </p>
<p>
     She'd showered, watered her plants that the neighbor had taken amazing care of, and finished any remaining cleanup from their marathon the night before. By the time she finished, her eyes fell onto her bookshelf and she stepped toward it, running her fingertips over a couple of the spines.
    </p>
<p>
     They landed on one that she'd been meaning to read for a while: The Shimmering State. It was fiction, but a thought piece on valuing the high of happiness more than one's sanity.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Hm. How fitting.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She pulled it off the shelf and located her sunglasses before making her way out to the deck. She had the book in one hand and a glass of wine in the other as she placed herself into her chair, leaning back into it. She took a sip of the wine, not caring that it was two in the afternoon, and set it back down as she cracked open the book.
    </p>
<p>
     As it turned out, it was a great deal easier to read when she did not have Agatha feet away from her as a glaring distraction.
    </p>
<p>
     She'd gotten through a good forty pages by the time her phone had started to ring. The grin that lit her up was wide and immediate as she reached over to grab her phone, elated at the sight of Agatha's profile indicating she wanted to FaceTime.
    </p>
<p>
     Without missing a beat, Rio swiped to answer, the words spilling before the image of Agatha even appeared on her screen.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good evening, my love!"
    </p>
<p>
     As the camera registered, though, Rio felt like she had been struck with a blast of nothing but ice, chilling her from head to toe. And then, as it processed? The flames swept in, staring at the crown of her head and racing down to the soles of her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     There, in the background, were those familiar swirls of marble on the wall. The corner caddy held all of the soaps, shampoos, and skin care products. The showerhead was on full blast.
    </p>
<p>
     None of that was as prevalent as Agatha, directly in the center of the frame and visible down to about mid-calf.
    </p>
<p>
     She was also completely naked.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's reaction went far beyond her cognition. In an instant, still gripping her phone tightly, she leaped to her feet, her eyes wide. As a result of her action, the book she had set in her lap launched off and over the railing of the deck, landing with a splash in the water.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha!" Rio fought to gasp.
    </p>
<p>
     The vexatious smirk she had been wearing immediately shifted into something softer as she took in the sight of Rio and what she was wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is that my USC shirt?" she asked, the desire for being a troublemaker suddenly pushed to the back-burner momentarily.
    </p>
<p>
     "I didn't know you cared about American college football. And also, you apparently did not get my message." Rio mused back as smoothly as she could manage despite the sudden hunger blooming in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could see it on her face, though, that she was losing the battle. She stepped closer to the other corner caddy where she had set her phone, that warm smile filling her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did not. But... I missed you. And I needed to shower before Dave and the lawyer come over, so I thought I'd give you a call and kill two birds with one stone." The way she rattled it off, it was like it was such a smart choice, such an obvious one.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know, I can't fault the logic, but maybe could you give a girl some warning next time? You made me ruin a really good book," Rio whined back, jutting out her lip in a dramatic pout that only caused Agatha's grin to grow.
    </p>
<p>
     "Baby, I'll buy you whatever book you want," Agatha mused, stepping back to pump some shampoo into her hands before working it into a lather atop her head. Her eyes were closed and her head was tilted back and Rio was having the hardest time not completely salivating at the sight. She had taken her seat again, but she was placed on the edge of it.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to be there, wanted to be the one to wash the six thousand miles off of Agatha's skin, but she just had to watch instead.
    </p>
<p>
     "How are the babes?" Agatha posed, though she was still engrossed in her task and Rio was growing more fevered with each passing moment.
    </p>
<p>
     "Th-they're good. They headed to the north part of the island so Nicky could take some pictures at sunset. They're going to stay the night and come back tomorrow."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha's eyes opened and the kindling that had previously been obvious in her eyes erupted into a full-fledged bonfire.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is that so?" she posed, her lips pursing in thought for a moment as she leaned back to rinse the shampoo. The conditioning process was roughly the same, but when she started to wash her body? Rio had seen her loofah many times, but they'd never used it. Right then, Agatha wasn't going to use it, either.
    </p>
<p>
     The way she touched her body, the way she knew it better than even Rio did, it was mesmerizing. Rio was entranced, her mouth hung open as she watched Agatha's palms leave trails of suds in their wake. She could see the spots she would press a little harder, her skin sinking at the pressure. She removed the showerhead from its fastening on the wall and rinsed herself off, but by this point, Rio was already drooling.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had known what she was doing when she made that phone call, and every bit of it was working.
    </p>
<p>
     As she replaced the head, she turned back to face Rio. Her skin was flushed, either from the water or from the knowledge that she had Rio on the other side of that screen wanting to come completely undone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached up, her palm in the center of her chest at first, but it moved down to her left breast, her fingers pulling her stiffened nipple between them as she exhaled a worked-up sigh.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I wish you were here."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio licked her lips, leaning forward over her knees to try and tame the pulsing in her core. She opened her mouth to speak, but the words seemed to fail her. Instead, Agatha tugged on the slack by speaking again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I want to touch you just as much as I ache to be touched by you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     A sharp breath pulled in between Rio's lips right before her teeth sank into the lower one, stifling the whimper that fought to escape.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha..."
     </i>
     Rio whined softly, hating every single inch of distance that separated them.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hold released on her chest, but her hand did not lift. Instead, it started a trek. It headed back to the center of her chest and then began to drift downward. Rio was stuck. She knew what this was, what Agatha was doing. She knew what it stirred in her, but the idea of getting to her feet and somehow making it to the bedroom?
    </p>
<p>
     The lower the hand wandered, though, she couldn't help it. She was on her feet in an instant, making record time of the course to get through the house.
    </p>
<p>
     With little regard, Rio threw the phone onto the bed and began to strip down, starting with her shorts. Just as she grabbed the hem of her shirt, Agatha's voice sounded, low and husky but still loud enough to be heard over the water.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Don't even think about taking that shirt off,"
     </i>
     she growled, and Rio dropped her hands; how did she know? Rio wasn't even in the frame.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped toward the bed, leaning into the frame of the phone with a smirk on her lips. "Oh, does that do it for you?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha let out a laugh that was strange in tone, but Rio realized it was because she had hit the nail on the head.
    </p>
<p>
     "The thought of balling the back of it up in my fist while I'm taking you from behind has crossed my mind once or twice since the beginning of this phone call," Agatha replied coolly, even though that sultry tone didn't shake.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let out a surprised gasp at the sudden pounding between her legs. She found herself asking that question she still had no answer to:
    </p>
<p>
     How the fuck did Agatha do that?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio picked the phone up and placed herself on the bed -- Agatha's spot, yet again -- her hand reaching up to tuck into the cut neck of the shirt, lowering it a little more over her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes were hungry and Rio swore she could almost see her chest vibrate with each drum of her heart. Her hands were smooth over her own body, sliding over her abdomen, her hips, behind her to her ass. She was putting on a show and Rio knew it. As one hand came back up her hip, though, it cut toward her middle. She took a step back toward the wall for support and hiked a leg up onto the edge of the tub.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought she might go into shock for the second time in her life but for an entirely different reason. She was just... still. She couldn't think, could hardly breathe. The moment Agatha touched her supple skin and let out that whimper?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio became a star. She had completely burst into white-hot light that could surely be seen from millions of miles away. She squirmed, but reached up again, pulling that fashioned scoop neck to reveal her right breast, though she kept the shirt on. When Agatha opened her eyes and became witness to the act?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Fuck, Rio,"
     </i>
     she hissed, leaning back a little more into the wall as her chin tipped up in satisfaction at her own pace.
    </p>
<p>
     Like she'd been jumpstarted back into reality, Rio snapped into action. Her free hand moved, pushing up the hem of the shirt just enough so that it was out of the way. Then, it continued its journey. The moment she reached her own warmth, she was not at all surprised at how wet she had become in the last ten minutes. Her head tipped back slightly and a sigh escaped her, turning into a moan somewhere near the middle.
    </p>
<p>
     At the sound, Agatha's eyes snapped open and cut to her, but she wasn't looking.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Gods, baby. You're so hot,"
     </i>
     Agatha managed, her breathing a little ragged, which encouraged Rio to increase the pressure and pace.
     <i>
      "Mmmm, what I wouldn't give to be there doing it for you. Kissing your back, my fingers inside of you..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agathaaa!"
     </i>
     The name escaped her in a frenzied cry, the need for more pressure, more friction building inside of her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I think you can still come for me, though, can't you, my love?"
     </i>
     Agatha purred over the screen and Rio could feel it; the bubbling and boiling of uncontained heat in her middle.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes opened, taking in the sight of the other woman who was licking her lips again, her hand still moving in its deliberate strokes, though she looked like she was all of five seconds away from coming unglued.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come for me, Rio."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The command was firm, a demand that came from a place of hunger and wanting. And, as it turned out, it was enough to do the trick.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips parted widely, and for a split second, there was no sound. Then,
     <i>
      "O-oh!"
     </i>
     Her body clenched and released physically, but the action caused a vibrating drum between her legs. Before she could register anything else, her eyes fell back to the phone just as Agatha released a wild and loud moan.
    </p>
<p>
     Even in her orgasmic haze, Rio noticed something.
    </p>
<p>
     Although Agatha's legs did shake in trying to support her weight, the reaction was much milder than every single time Rio had ever pulled an orgasm out of her.
    </p>
<p>
     As they both panted, coming down from the high of whatever that was, Rio couldn't stop thinking about it.
    </p>
<p>
     "That was... different..." Rio managed through breaths that were slowing.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hmm, how so?" Agatha mused as she came closer to the phone again.
    </p>
<p>
     "The first time we had sex, I seriously thought you were having a seizure. And in the times since I thought it was just what an orgasm did to you," Rio explained, though her eyes were still stoked with the heat of the embers burning there. "But... that's the one time it wasn't like that."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's smirk hiked up a corner of her lips, her eyes warm but still wild.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio, my love.
     <i>
      No one
     </i>
     has ever made me come like that aside from you."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes widened. That couldn't possibly be true. There was no way that was just something she could do... was there?
    </p>
<p>
     "Well," Rio posed, the pink still on her cheeks from their efforts. "If you miss it bad enough, you'll find a way to come back as soon as you can."
    </p>
<p>
     "Already working on it, baby. Hence the 8 pm lawyer meeting. Which, if I do not get out of here and get dressed for, it not going to happen."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's smile fell slightly, but she did her best to hide her disappointment.
    </p>
<p>
     "Call me before you go to sleep tonight," Rio requested softly, her head tilting in question.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll call you as soon as they leave. You have my word."
    </p>
<p>
     "I miss you, Agatha."
    </p>
<p>
     "I miss you too, Rio."
    </p>
<p>
     The look on Agatha's face made Rio want to burst into tears, but she found a way to hide them for the moment. She wouldn't make this any harder than it already was.
    </p>
<p>
     "Te amo, mi amor."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha picked up the phone, holding it closer as the warmest smile curled her lips. It was an obvious attempt to mask the greater effect those words seemed to have on her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, beautiful."
    </p>
<p>
     And then, the call ended.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was alone again.
    </p>
<p>
     Somehow, though, this time didn't sting so bad.

<p>
     That night, Agatha had called Rio again via FaceTime, but this time she had been dressed, and yet it had still managed to knock Rio on her ass.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been wearing her kit.
    </p>
<p>
     What was even better? She had informed Rio that the following morning, her attorney would be serving her mother with the countersuit. She had no more than 24 hours to respond or drop the suit, otherwise it was going to court.
    </p>
<p>
     This opened up a couple of different possibilities. Either she would respond with conditions Agatha might be willing to meet, drop it entirely, and realize that if Agatha won that countersuit she would lose everything she owned, or she would fight. Considering that the woman had tried to kill her only child, Rio wasn't sure she could safely assume which course of action the woman might choose.
    </p>
<p>
     What she hoped she would choose? Agatha had told Rio that she would even make some kind of deal if it meant getting to come home to her family. She knew that Agatha was struggling the most in all of this because she was the one completely removed from all four of them. Yes, it was hard on Rio, but she had her daughters and Nicky who had been doing an amazing job of holding her together that far into it.
    </p>
<p>
     She could see it on Agatha's face the longer they talked that night just how badly she wanted to be home. She missed them, and she missed being able to enjoy their company whenever she could. Rio had managed to talk her into laying down with her; it was only 10 pm in Auckland, but she knew that for Agatha it was two in the morning.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd crawled into bed and propped their phones up on the nightstands, both turned upside down so that they could keep them on charge. As predicted, Agatha had whispered a soft 'I love you,' before she had fallen asleep, leaving Rio there to just watch her. For a moment, she was almost able to feel like they were in bed together again. It felt like they were close like they could almost reach out and touch.
    </p>
<p>
     It was just a phone screen, though. However, that didn't disappoint Rio as much at that moment after Agatha had laid out the plan for the following days. She knew that Agatha was trying as hard as she could, and even though she had told her over and over again that she was so thankful, she was not sure Agatha ever actually understood how much she meant it.
    </p>
<p>
     The next day came and went and while they were texting back and forth quite a bit, Agatha had been working with her legal team to put measures in place to prevent something like this from happening again. She had finally reached a point in her life where she was definitively done with her mother's bullshit, but that had meant that she'd been busy most of the day.
    </p>
<p>
     It was understandable, but it made that pang of longing strike her a little harder. By the time the evening rolled around, there was still an hour left and there had not been a single word from Evanora Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had called her as she rode back to the house in the back of the town car. She had tried, but she had not been able to hide how upset she was. Her voice had been low, too soft. It had been dejected and it broke Rio. Her true love was hurting and there was nothing she could do about it. She was half tempted to just say fuck Evanora and get on a plane anyway, but Agatha would have been upset by a disregard for her wishes, and that wasn't what she wanted to do either.
    </p>
<p>
     It was just... hard. Yes, she missed Agatha, and what Agatha was feeling was something similar, but it was so very different. Agatha was battling not only loneliness, but she was fighting this ridiculous battle with her mother, too. She was losing that determination, but Rio wouldn't let her. She'd spent an entire ten minutes asserting to Agatha that it would be over soon, that they would find a way to make it right. She knew that she was probably talking in circles, but it felt like Agatha seemed to calm down a bit.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha finally started to speak, to announce that she was home, but she cut herself off.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, baby. Let me call you back really quick, okay? The lawyer is calling me."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, go!" Rio rushed, her heart leaping into her throat. "I love you!"
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, too, Rio."
    </p>
<p>
     As she said it, Rio could already tell that she was pulling the phone away from her ear to swap over to the other call.
    </p>
<p>
     And suddenly, Rio was nervous. She stood from her chair on the deck and made her way inside to find Nicky on the floor with his back against the couch and his laptop on his thighs as Estee lay with her head in Tay's lap on the couch. Almost concurrently, their eyes lifted to take her in, all three completely aware that she had been on the phone with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She offered a tight but unsure smile in response, her eyes conveying that she didn't know anything yet.
    </p>
<p>
     "She had to go. It's either really good news or really bad news, so I'm going to take a really quick shower before she calls back. I love you lot," she told them softly, blowing them a collective kiss before she made her way back to the bedroom to gather a change of clothes before she tucked inside the washroom.
    </p>
<p>
     She was, as promised, pretty quick. It had been less than ten minutes before she was toweling off and pulling on a tank top and a pair of shorts. In the middle of brushing her teeth, though, her phone began to ring on the counter. Her chest stilled in its movements, her breath held in place in her lungs.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was calling her.
    </p>
<p>
     This meant one of two things: 1) She needed to yell. Or. 2) She was going to tell her she was coming home.
    </p>
<p>
     She snatched it off of the porcelain and answered it at the same time she spit out her toothpaste, Agatha's voice instantly in her ears.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi, gorgeous," Agatha cooed at her, and Rio was pretty convinced she was choking on her heart. She knew what that meant. Maybe not the extent of it, but she knew that this meant Agatha had good news.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, my love. So... what happened?" she asked, her voice timid, almost bordering on quiet.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... With nine hoursleft in the deadline, her attorney reached out. Initially, she told mine that the suit wasn't going to be dropped. So... maybe someone I know or don't know indulged in a little blackmail about something she did a very long time ago that no one but me knows about. And if it comes from another source, she'd be scared enough to drop it." Agatha exhaled a little chuckle. "Turns out, when your kid knows where you buried the body, you suddenly have a lot more to lose."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nearly choked.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha... she
     <i>
      actually
     </i>
     killed someone?" Rio was in complete disbelief. Not only was that insane but to know that her mother was capable of it even before she turned it on her? That was an entirely new layer of trauma.
    </p>
<p>
     "My father. Before I was even born, turns out. She did a terrible job, and it was even in the backyard in the fucking
     <i>
      flower bed.
     </i>
     So, you know, sixteen-year-old me was tired of looking at dead grass and dirt and wanted to plant some flowers." Another chuckle, but this one had a sardonic ring to it. "Did not expect to find bones. The second hole she dug was deeper after she beat my ass for getting into something I shouldn't have."
    </p>
<p>
     "Turns out, even being near seventy, prison isn't exactly the 'it' place to be."
    </p>
<p>
     "So... So you..." Rio tried to form, but the way her heart was hammering and she felt like she couldn't catch her breath were beginning to impede her ability to speak.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm coming home, baby. It's a little too late to catch a flight tonight, but I hope to leave no later than 5 am your time tomorrow. I'll upgrade to non-stop so I will be there tomorrow evening."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to speak, to say something, to tell Agatha how happy was but all she could do was cry. It was stupid, wasn't it? It had been two days; this should not have overwhelmed her as much as it was. The line had been quiet for a moment, but she sniffed as she attempted to collect herself.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I am so fucking happy, Agatha."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio knew that there were only a handful of phrases that she had ever uttered in her life that she had meant even half as much as she meant that.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew that in the future, this could happen again. Agatha still had a career, and while Rio's project was privatized and she was able to work at her leisure since the LA trip, that could be done from anywhere that had working internet. It seemed insane to not be able to stand the distance, but Agatha's absence had felt worse than almost any other injury Rio had incurred in her life.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Me too, my love. I cannot wait to be there."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Her words were so warm, wrapping around Rio like a warm hug. It was all she had wanted since the moment she had walked away from her in that airport. She had just wanted Agatha back in her arms, and now that she was getting it? She hardly knew what to do with herself. She was trying to work out plans to go pick her up.
    </p>
<p>
     "The kids and I will be there to bring you home the second you land," Rio told her, her voice a little stronger, a little more sewn with conviction.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, they will not," Agatha corrected her, but there was a shift in her tone that was almost enough to cause whiplash. "And you're going to ask Tay for her keys." It wasn't even a question, Agatha was telling her what she was going to do, and at first Rio didn't understand.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why would I ask Tay for her keys? My car runs just fine," Rio voiced back, her forehead creasing with a slight wrinkle.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because Tay has an SUV."
    </p>
<p>
     "But I'm not bringing the k--
     <i>
      ohhhhhhh.
     </i>
     " It had smacked into her mid-sentence. She was not bringing Agatha straight home.
    </p>
<p>
     If she understood what Agatha was implying, they were not even going to make it out of the parking garage.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're serious?" Rio shot back, almost as if she didn't buy it.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll pay to have it cleaned the day after."
    </p>
<p>
     A shiver ran up Rio's spine, but instead of chills, it left heat in its wake. She could feel it in her lumbar, all the way up to the base of her neck. Agatha had zero idea just how much sex appeal she had, and it wasn't even in having to see her physically. She knew how to command the English language, and knew how to say what she exactly what she needed to make sure that she was understood fully and clearly.
    </p>
<p>
     "So have you booked your flight yet?" Rio asked, the lightest giggle coming from her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Dave is working on it right now. He said he'd have everything emailed over to me by the end of the night. I'm home now, but there are a few other details I have to work out regarding a few things. But, if you're still awake in a couple of hours, I can call you back?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Rio admonished softly, her tone low. "When you finish what you need to do, you crawl into bed and get some rest so that you're not exhausted tomorrow. And then, after a little over twelve hours, you will be back in Auckland."
    </p>
<p>
     "Back home," Agatha corrected her. Rio almost chastised her, saying that the airport wasn't quite home, but she knew exactly what Agatha meant by that.
    </p>
<p>
     They would be together again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes. Back home. With your family. Where you belong," Rio asserted, the smile audible in her tone.
    </p>
<p>
     The line was silent for a moment, and Rio couldn't help but wonder what was going through Agatha's head. There was no noise in the background, just silence.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio..." Agatha's voice was soft, but the hesitation indicated that either she didn't know what to say or she was too afraid to put it in the world. As it turned out, it happened to be the former.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know that I would do absolutely anything in the world for us, and for our kids right?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's smile was warm in her voice as she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know you would Agatha. You blackmailed your mother so that you didn't have to spend any more time in America than you had to. I don't think there's a single thing in this world that you wouldn't do, and depending on what it was and why you did it, I don't think I'd have many objections."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's laugh sounded. God, that laugh. That laugh did so many things to Rio, messed with her head in ways nothing else could. It made her feel light, made her feel like she just could have floated right away and not have had a qualm in the world about it.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you more than anything in the world, Rio Vidal," Agatha voiced, the happiness clinging to her words.
    </p>
<p>
     "And I love you, Agatha Harkness. Who knew that we'd start with me trying to play hero, and you turn out to be the actual hero?" she returned, her voice so woven with affection and love.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't need a cape. I wear expensive coats," she shot back, and they both dissolved into laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     "Finish up your mischief and go to bed, my love. I can't wait to see you tomorrow."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn't have to say a word and Rio could already tell she had an ear-to-ear grin across her face. Hearing it out loud made it more real, made it more tangible. Hearing herself say it made Rio realize that it was going to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll text you in the morning when I board."
    </p>
<p>
     "You can call me, you know."
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio, that would be at four in the morning."
    </p>
<p>
     "And?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm not waking you up at four in the morning so you can tell me everything's going to be fine, which I already know but will just forget at the moment." Agatha was trying to sound annoyed, but Rio knew that she was just voicing what she would genuinely need but would not ask for.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, then. I'll just have to set an alarm for 3:55 and give you a call myself."
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, you impossibly stubborn woman."
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you too, Superwoman."
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could offer any kind of protest, Rio disconnected the call, a smug smile still on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     She tried to check herself as she met her reflection in the mirror, but she was unable to contain the squeal of sheer delight at the idea that she was less than a day away from being reunited with Agatha. She heard quick footsteps followed by a knock on the door.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama, are you okay?" came Tay's voice through the door.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned and pulled the door open, unable to keep the cheek-pushing grin off of her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "She's coming home! Tomorrow!" Her eyes dropped to Tay, though she fought to keep her expression neutral as the other two cheered in the background. "Do you think I could borrow your car? There's something she wants to pick up and it won't fit in my car."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was a bad liar. Rio knew Rio was a bad liar, and yet she had tried her hand at it anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     For once in her life, she'd managed to pull it off.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, of course! How exciting!"
    </p>
<p>
     And so, Rio had spent the rest of the night with the kids, relaying the information she had received. They'd all four been so impossibly overjoyed, and even though Evanora Harkness could go fuck herself, they had all learned a very powerful lesson.
    </p>
<p>
     Even if things were hard, they would still manage to find a way through them.
    </p>
<p>
     Everyone had turned in for the night, but finding sleep hadn't been easy for Rio. She'd tossed and turned, even getting up at one point to spray Agatha's pillow with her perfume in hopes that it might help.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been a little after 1 am that she had finally found the solace of slumber, but not three hours later, her alarm was going off.
    </p>
<p>
     She had called Agatha, as promised, though Agatha had immediately recognized that Rio had not been fully awake. She was speaking, but alert would not have been a good description. Agatha had talked to her for a few minutes, but it had been enough of a comfort that she had fallen back asleep. What she would only see later when she checked her call log was that Agatha had stayed on the phone, listening to her snore for the next fifty-two minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     When she woke up a couple of hours later, she could smell where someone had been toasting bread and wondered for just a second if the girls were finally forcing Nicky to try marmite.
    </p>
<p>
     The gag she heard about a minute later confirmed that she was right.
    </p>
<p>
     She breathed a soft laugh as she managed to drag herself out of bed and into the bathroom to brush her teeth and smooth out her hair. She reappeared a moment later, the grin on her face as she walked into the living room to see Nicky chugging a cup of coffee to try to mask over the flavor of the marmite.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd spent the morning taking boxes over to the other house to keep themselves busy while they waited for the afternoon to roll around so that Rio could leave to head to the airport. They had indeed managed to get the majority of the things over; the furniture had been delivered on their first trip and Nicky had stayed while it was all assembled.
    </p>
<p>
     It was quite amazing to walk in on the last trip and finally see the vision. Things had even been put in places that she quite liked. They took an entire tour of the house and Rio was so fucking excited to be able to show it to her fiancée, to be able to tell her that this was yet another one of their homes.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio declared she was headed to the airport, the kids all hugged her and told her to bring Agatha home, which she promised she would.
    </p>
<p>
     She traded for Tay's keys and told them she would see them as soon as she could, offering a wave and a bright smile as she pulled the door shut behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been practically buzzing the entire drive to the airport, her mind drifting to what was likely to happen in the back of that vehicle, the one where she'd had enough sense to already have the seats down. Agatha had been very clear on what it was she wanted, and Rio would not be the one to deny her. It had been a couple of days, realistically, but it had felt like an eternity.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's heart was nearly beating out of her chest as she made her way through the airport, waiting impatiently by the gate, and even more impatiently for Agatha's text to roll through that she had landed.
    </p>
<p>
     What she did not know was that Agatha had landed, but she was in the process of texting the children to tell them that they needed to decide where the three of them were going to stay for the night, either the houseboat or the house, but that they needed to make the decision collectively. It had ended up with her and Rio's end destination being the houseboat, which was fine with her. Once she'd sorted it out and sent the kids money to buy themselves dinner, she had texted Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     As she felt her phone vibrate in her hand, she lifted it immediately to see that Agatha was about to depart and would see her in just a few moments.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt like she was going to pass out. This was a first between them. This was the first time that a knowing reunion was coming. This was the first time she would pick up Agatha from the airport, but she knew it probably wouldn't be the last. More than that, the duration might be longer in the future.
    </p>
<p>
     After another two minutes, Rio saw her.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hair was blowing behind her with how quickly she was walking, her duffel slung over her chest. It didn't seem to be slowing her stride in the least. Their eyes met across about forty yards of space and even though Rio hadn't been sure it was possible, Agatha's pace quickened even more.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a step back from the gate so that she could brace herself for what she knew was coming. The moment Agatha crossed that threshold, her arms flew open and she nearly ran right into Rio, wrapping her up and using her strength to lift her off the ground, spinning her around just to put her back on her feet again.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could make her next move, though, Rio's hands were on her face and she was pulling her in, kissing her as hard as she could. She had missed her so fucking much and she needed to find some way beyond words to make sure Agatha knew it.
    </p>
<p>
     They were like two teenage girls, not giving a single care for any local disdain for public affection. It was just them, together, again. It was Agatha and Rio. Rio and Agatha, as they were meant to be.
    </p>
<p>
     They kissed for a long moment, but Agatha was the one who pulled away first. As Rio's eyes flickered open into hers, she saw what she had known would be there.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, once again, was absolutely starved. Rio had missed her, and she had missed the intimacy that came with being physical, but Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     At that moment, it looked like Agatha had thought of little else in her entire time away.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You brought Tay's car?"
     </i>
     Agatha asked lowly, stealing another soft kiss, though as she pulled away her smirk was wide.
    </p>
<p>
     "I didn't think it was much of an option, but I would have anyway if it was."
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Well, then we should probably go before I show how classless I can be and drag you into the first bathroom we see on the way out."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had watched over two days as Rio had built up her fuel, and kept stocking for when they could see one another again. All that fuel?
    </p>
<p>
     Once again, Agatha ripped that torch and set her alight.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You thought about this your entire flight, did you?"
     </i>
     Rio purred in question.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh, my love, you have no idea what I thought about on that flight."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Another shock of heat, this time in her middle, straight down to between her legs. She had been trying to keep her composure, but it was slowly slipping. The heat had gripped her and she suddenly had no idea how they were going to make it to the car without stripping each other down in the middle of that damn airport.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha grabbed her hand and gave a tug, leaving a buffering Rio to stumble into step with her, though she quickly found herself in stride with Agatha in just a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     The giggles, the glances, it truly was like they were young and wild and ever so free. They didn't have a care in the world as Agatha threw her bag into the front seat on the floor. She wanted to keep as much space open in the back as she could manage. She nearly slammed the door shut, though it hadn't been her intention before she turned back to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Those blues were almost white hot with how much heat was burning there, how much hunger. Her eyes never left Rio's as she reached forward and pulled the back door open. Rio hadn't looked away, though, or made any kind of movement to climb in. Agatha's jaw tensed, her eyes flickering across Rio's features in impatience.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio," she asserted firmly as if this would impel her to move.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hm?" Rio posed, that little smirk twisting up her lips as her eyes glimmered with mischief.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's voice dropped, a sultry growl of command.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Get in.

<p>
     This was beyond heat.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn't just burning as she stood there, wild eyes darting over Agatha's face in silent demand and a voracious appetite.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was disintegrating, turning to goddamn ash and she had no idea how she was supposed to move. She wanted to move, wanted to climb into that car, but the way Agatha was looking at her like that?
    </p>
<p>
     She was planted, her roots sunk into the concrete. It was stupid; she wanted this, but there was the tiniest echo in the back of her mind.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Let her show you how much she needs you.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At the thought, the smirk slowly crept back up Rio's lips and Agatha realized that those cogs in her head had started moving again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't have the patience for this,"
     </i>
     Agatha hissed. She moved forward, out of the way of the door which was next to the wall in the corner of the lot. She lodged her shoulder just below Rio's ribs and locked both arms around the backs of Rio's thighs and lifted.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nearly folded over Agatha, a giggle leaving her that was somehow both sultry and completely amused. The sound made Agatha's arms tighten around her legs as she shifted, backing up around the edge of the door so she could pour Rio inside of it. She was careful, though, to make sure Rio did not hit any part of her body on the frame until her ass was on the back of that folded down seat.
    </p>
<p>
     "In," Agatha instructed, tipping her chin toward the interior of the car. Her voice was hard as stone, but Rio knew she wasn't angry, she wasn't upset.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt
     <i>
      powerful.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could see it there as she sat back on her palms, not making any move to relocate per Agatha's request. Instead, she just... took her in. She looked... different than when they had parted.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't the ravenous desire that had taken her over. It wasn't even that she ached for what they'd lost out on in her time in America.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked... lighter. She had finally put the nail in the coffin of her mother's insane history of abuse; she was finally free. The weight of the world had lifted from her shoulders at knowing that her future was her own, and that it was unlikely her mother would be stupid enough to meddle in it again.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had taken her life on by the horns, she had wrestled and fought for her life to put an end to this, and she had won.
    </p>
<p>
     As a result of said victory?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wanted her prize.
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio? In that moment, it hit her full force as Agatha stood there stripping her own with her scorching gaze that
     <i>
      she
     </i>
     was that prize.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio. Daniela. Vidal."
     </i>
     Agatha's words were sharp, but the lust she was feeling wrapped around them like barbed wire.
     <i>
      "Move. Your. Ass."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     A chill as quick as lightning shot from between her legs, all the way up through her torso and into her throat. It escaped her lips as a choked gasp. For another moment, she felt like her entire being was filled with nothing but cement. She was stunned to stillness by this side of Agatha. She was not fearful, did not thing Agatha would harm her in any way, but this power-fueled appetite was something Rio had never borne witness to before.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, after what Agatha would have said was an eternity, Rio's soul seemed to snap back into her body and she heeded the demand, moving herself to the back, her back pressing against the inside of the hatch.
    </p>
<p>
     In an instant, Agatha had climbed inside and pulled the door shut. On all fours because of the confinement, she made her way back to Rio, who's legs were directly out in front of her. She seemed to debate for a moment, staring at those legs.
    </p>
<p>
     For once, Rio could not hear the war going on within Agatha on whether she wanted to be between them or atop them.
    </p>
<p>
     Her face screwed up in her own indecision and Rio was simply sat watching, her heart nearly breaking her ribs as too many thoughts seemed to be racing through her head.
    </p>
<p>
     After another moment fighting the war, Agatha's face smoothed, though still starved and her hands grabbed Rio's knees in a grip that was foreign to Rio, but one that made that steady and heavy drum beat harder in every pulse point her body had.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled them apart with force, however careful it was. Her goal here was pleasure, not pain, and it still showed in the way she was handling Rio, despite how impossibly desperate she seemed to be feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     She moved forward between Rio's knees and folded her legs so that she was sitting on her heels. Hands were moving in the blink of an eye, finding both sides of Rio's jaw with an undeniable ease. She had moved in like she was careening toward Rio's lips in a reckless freefall, but she stopped just short.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes locked into those electric blues that she had missed so fucking much and what she saw?
    </p>
<p>
     She saw the want, the need, and the starvation. She also saw the fear, the relief, and the understanding that the longing was over with.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had no need to speak, but her gravelly whisper hit the air anyway.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What scares you, Agatha Harkness?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     While that look on her face didn't shift much from her show of desire, her expression did soften. Her eyes did the same, but only for a moment. Her voice was strangled as it came out, something that could have barely been called a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Having to do that again."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Instead of waiting for her to initiate, Rio leaned toward her in a move that almost caused Agatha's hands to slip off of her face, but she seemed to recover, her fingers curling around the sides of Rio's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     Their lips met roughly, hardly flush but with the way they moved, parting and grabbing in a way that showed just how famished they both had been after being denied this for more than a day. It had been too many days, even if it had really only been a grand total of three, and one of those days was the cumulative time Agatha had been in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, it was Rio who pressed her tongue between Agatha's lips, curling up to grace the roof of her mouth and the back of her teeth, eliciting a groan from Agatha that vibrated her own teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     It took no time for Agatha to push back, her own tongue fighting against Rio's to try and get into her mouth, instead. It was so desperate, so soaked in absolute need.
    </p>
<p>
     This was something they both
     <i>
      wanted,
     </i>
     sure.
    </p>
<p>
     But the kind of malnourishment that had hollowed them out in their time apart had left them damn near gluttonous.
    </p>
<p>
     Their sighs smacked into every window, their moans likely not contained by the glass, but where Rio had placed them? It had been strategic, had been calculated. Sure, she probably wouldn't have given a shit if anyone did stumble upon them, but for the sake of decency, she figured it was a better idea to tuck them into a corner where there would be little other traffic.
    </p>
<p>
     After minutes wore on of lips and tongues and teeth, Agatha's impatience had started to show in the way her fingers curled, pressing harder and harder into the muscle of Rio's neck. The skin was void of blood flow, turning white at the pressure.
    </p>
<p>
     This was desire in its most raw form.
    </p>
<p>
     After another moment, Agatha finally ripped their lips apart to only leave them both gasping for whatever oxygen they could cram into every inch of their lungs. Agatha's lust was not tempered in any way, though. Her eyes dropped to the grey hoodie that was a little baggy on Rio's frame and for a second time, she was torn on what call to make.
    </p>
<p>
     Easily, she could have stripped it right off. She could have reached down with fervor and shucked it aside, irrelevant as a husk off of a cob of corn. But... something else was brewing in Agatha's eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Take it off,"
     </i>
     she managed through a growl, those lights still striking like bolts of lightning in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio's own eyes began to shimmer with her coy playfulness.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Just the jumper, or the shirt, too?"
     </i>
     Rio posed, though she tried her hardest to feign innocence in her tone, as if she were testing the waters.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Both,"
     </i>
     Agatha shot back, eliciting no more than a shrug from Rio, who reached down to gather both garments in her hands to pull them over her head.
    </p>
<p>
     As she started to lift, the fabric of the other shirt became visible and Agatha's eyes snapped down at the pop of color, her tongue immediately pressing out to wet her lips. A hand shot out, circling around Rio's wrist. As Rio's gaze lifted, she could immediately see that Agatha was holding her breath and her jaw was bulging on both sides.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You fucking did not,"
     </i>
     she hissed at her in the same moment her hand dropped Rio's and moved down with the other joining it to peel the layers apart. Her movements were a flurry of the burning hot pit in her stomach, but Agatha managed to get the sweatshirt off, tossing it behind her to the front of the car.
    </p>
<p>
     As she turned her focus back to Rio, somehow? That fire was only burning hotter, brighter, spreading quickly over every single inch of her expression and leaving no trace of anything else in its path.
    </p>
<p>
     There, in that cut-neck cardinal shirt, sat Rio grinning like a damn fool.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio,"
     </i>
     Agatha managed, though it was more of a moan than an actual calling of her name. She was trying to be stern, trying to exercise her power, but Rio had moved enough pieces that Agatha was in check, close to losing her most prized piece on the board: her control.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Wow, it really
      <b>
       does
      </b>
      do it for you, doesn't it?"
     </i>
     Rio hummed back, her lips shifting from her grin into the most devious smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha almost looked panicked in her frenzy, truly torn between what her next move was supposed to be. In a rush, her words tumbled out, frantic and demanding.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "If you're not naked everywhere else in the next sixty seconds, I very may well have an aneurism,"
     </i>
     she managed, her throat tensing as she swallowed down the lust that had knotted in the middle of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's giggle was alluring, tempting. It was meant to push just one more time before she finally caved, moving to slide her shorts down her legs as she kicked her sandals off, one landing to the side and the other smacking the top of the dash in the front. The moment they were off, bare skin hit scratchy material, but Rio didn't care.
    </p>
<p>
     How could she, when Agatha still had that wild expression on her face?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hands fell to Rio's calves, immediately starting a journey upward, but Rio was quick in her reaction to jerk her knees up, almost out of Agatha's grasp, but not quite.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Ah ah,"
     </i>
     Rio admonished, her own eyes sparking with jolts of electricity.
     <i>
      "We're not playing that game where you fuck me fully clothed,"
     </i>
     she added, her brows hiking to accentuate the point she was trying to make.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could even finish the process of a single blink, Agatha was moving, damn near ripping her own clothes off. She didn't bother to unbutton her blouse, instead opting to pull it over her head, tossing it back unceremoniously to land with Rio's hoodie. That deft hand had popped the clasps on her back in record time and she was contorting herself within the space to shed her pants and underwear.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was rapt, completely taken by the speed and efficiency with which Agatha was moving. It could not have been more than forty-five seconds from the time she started for Agatha to poise herself back on her knees. She did not press forward but instead was immobile in her wonder.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze swept slowly up from Agatha's knees, over her stomach to hesitate only a moment on her breasts before it continued, finally locking with her blue one.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's jaw shifted slightly, that tongue poking out to swipe across her lips in an attempt to chase the feeling of sandpaper away. Her chest was heaving, but Rio knew that it was not a product of the effort it had taken her to remove her clothes. Instead, she was just that turned on.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Every day without this is fucking misery,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed at her, and while the commanding tone of authority and ecstasy was still there, there was something else there. It was a tender understanding between the two of them that even three days apart had been awful.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed down her own heat, trying to keep it from choking her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Then take what you've been missing."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The granted permission seemed to completely tank Agatha in the way that she actually buckled the slightest bit in a way she probably thought Rio might miss due to how quickly she lunged forward, landing roughly on her palms, her face immediately in front of Rio's. Their lips were a breath apart, but Rio sensed more movement.
    </p>
<p>
     In a gentler fashion, Agatha placed her palm flat between Rio's knees and pushed the left one aside enough for her to move, shifting to place herself over Rio's right leg, Agatha's own right leg between Rio's knees.
    </p>
<p>
     The same moment Agatha crushed their lips together, she moved yet again, but this one was calculated and intentional. Her right knee pressed directly to the peak between Rio's legs, causing her instant moan to pour into Agatha's mouth. She lowered her own dripping core to the top of Rio's thigh, her hips shifting downward against the contact the moment it was made.
    </p>
<p>
     The more they kissed, the more Agatha's hands moved to navigate beneath Rio's shirt, doing everything she could to search out any difference she might find in the skin scape that she had grown all too familiar with over the passing months. They pressed and pulled, felt and grasped. Arms, back, sides, breasts, stomach. There was not an inch of skin that she could reach that she did not plan on touching.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's own hands were gripping so hard at Agatha's hips that she was sure her nails were causing minor damage, but without a complaint from Agatha, she had no conscious thought of letting up. Feeling her lover ravish her in such a way? It was stunning to a point where there was absolutely no other thought in her head than what it took to keep kissing her like that.
    </p>
<p>
     She was entirely lost in it when Agatha made her next move. Her hips shifted down in a search for friction, but as she did so, her right knee moved forward, too. The pressure, for Rio, caused her to squeal against Agatha's teeth, though her own hips lifted, searching for the same feeling of movement, of pressure.
    </p>
<p>
     In a sudden rush of cold air, Agatha's lips were gone. As Rio opened her own to protest, her eyes still closed, she felt the warmth somewhere else; her neck.
    </p>
<p>
     The feel of Agatha's teeth was an instant one as they sunk into her flesh, not enough to break skin, but enough to cause that flash of pain that was more enticing than it was actually painful. Rio's breath caught, and then fought to escape in a choked whine, her hand nearly flying to land on the back of Agatha's head, her fingers tangling in her hair in a tight grip.
    </p>
<p>
     Another bite, but then lips sucking, pulling, tugging. She'd been the one to make that move before, but right then she could literally feel just how much Agatha was practically dying for this. She was more than hungry, more than famished, and even more than starved.
    </p>
<p>
     The last three days had emptied Agatha out, completely.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, she was going to get her fill.
    </p>
<p>
     The shifts in her posture were becoming more frequent, her hips beginning to find a rhythm against the top of Rio's thigh, also helping to create enough friction and pressure with her knee against Rio's core that it was obvious she was doing what she had set out to do.
    </p>
<p>
     The moans were growing in frequency, too, as well as volume. Rio was doing everything she could to keep a clear head, but that was damn near out the window. How could she?
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha's lips moved and lifted, Rio's whine was immediate, but it only grew longer and louder the moment she felt the tip of Agatha's tongue running around the edge of her ear. She was even more frantic now, lifting her hips for the release of that feeling that was in the pit of her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha caught on, though, and removed nearly every bit of contact between them. Her tongue clicked in admonishment and she shook her head almost imperceptibly.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "That's not how you get your first one."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's skin somehow paled and flushed nearly at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     First one?
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, dear gods.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha scooted back so that she was at Rio's feet again, her jaw set as she debated where this was going and how best to accommodate to the lack of space. That look, it was so studious, so observant and oh so very calculating.
    </p>
<p>
     She licked her lips again and brought forth a hand, two fingers extended, palm side up. She gave a flick of her wrist, those fingers waving their gentle direction.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Get up,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed at her, the huskiness of her tone sinking right through Rio, straight into her bones.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, there was no hesitation. She raised to her knees in front of Agatha, the fronts of their bodies only mere inches apart. There was this tension between them that wasn't forced or awkward.
    </p>
<p>
     It was just... complete reverence.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand raised, almost tentatively, as her fingertips brushed over one of Rio's nipples in a playful taunt, that wicked smirk curling up Agatha's lips at the whispered moan that rolled out of Rio's throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand moved, pressing flat-palmed to Rio's sternum above her neckline before it sailed over her skin and around the back of her head, Agatha's grip strong as she pulled her forward for one last enticement, one last chance to get her as riled and wet as she could possibly manage. That kiss was broken with a little more force, as Agatha had used her hold in Rio's hair to pull her away.
    </p>
<p>
     The deviousness both in Agatha's eyes and in that twisted smirk? It nearly caused Rio to forget what it meant to just simply breathe.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hands and knees. Now."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's lips parted in both surprise and to form an answer, but it got stuck somewhere in her windpipe, nearly choking her. Her eyes were wide, but she managed a nod to signify that she'd understood and was on her way to obeying.
    </p>
<p>
     She managed to shuffle a bit, the skin of her knees dragging across the rough material of the seat backing and leaned forward, her palms hitting it, too. She could hear it before she felt it, as Agatha scooted forward. Her hands slid onto the haunch of Rio's hips, gripping hard as she pressed the front of her own body to the backside of Rio's. There was no other actual intention in the act outside of physical closeness, but it still yanked the groan right out from between those soft, full lips of Rio's.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hands began to trek, though, sliding around to Rio's stomach, just beneath the shirt she couldn't have looked any hotter in. Although Rio didn't know it, it was one of Agatha's favorite parts of her body. The little pouch of skin that signified she had once carried life so many years ago did not differ that much from Agatha's own, but for some reason, it was one of the most beautiful things, and Agatha never missed an opportunity to just silently appreciate it. Right then, she was still doing it soundlessly, but was instead using her hands to prove the devotion.
    </p>
<p>
     Her touch was gentle but assertive as it simply felt every bit of Rio's body she could reach. She spent time on her belly and abdomen, but then began to move. The higher they moved, the more Agatha seemed to fold over the back of her. Every inch of the skin on Agatha's abdomen, breasts, sternum lay completely flush against every single curve and divot of muscle in Rio's back.
    </p>
<p>
     Both of Agatha's hands had traversed high enough to cup both of Rio's breasts in her palm, grasping and kneading as she pressed their hips tighter together. She used her hold on Rio to keep her pulled close, not willing to let her get even an inch away.
    </p>
<p>
     As worshipped as Rio felt, though? She was tired of the emptiness.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha,"
     </i>
     she panted in her plea.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head dropped, her lips only an inch or two away from Rio's ear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Tell me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha... please,"
     </i>
     Rio whimpered, bordering on sounding pathetic with the way she was begging.
     <i>
      "I need to feel you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted and peeled herself off of Rio's, though her hands never once left her body. Instead, the one hooked into her hip and the other snaked around her front, right down her middle. The time for playing games appeared over and it was no longer about building this up before it reached critical mass.
    </p>
<p>
     That time was now.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's fingertips brushed so lightly over the soft mounds of skin, just feeling, just exploring. She could feel as Rio pushed her hips back into her own pubic bone, a surprised gasp filling her lungs. As she pressed lower, her fingers met
     <i>
      dripping
     </i>
     warmth, a low growl of a chuckle falling from her lips as she set to exploring something so familiar and yet still so new each and every time.
    </p>
<p>
     She was painfully slow and deliberate in each pull, each push and stroke she made. With their closeness, she could feel every shudder, every single tremble that a well placed swipe of her fingers within Rio's wetness seemed to pull.
    </p>
<p>
     The way Rio hadn't stopped exhaling little wines the entire time?
    </p>
<p>
     It had finally had its effect. Agatha pulled her hand back and Rio's head hung, catching her breath in the singular moment of reprieve. Agatha leaned again, though she had adjusted enough that her lips were able to land on Rio's shoulder, a soft question whispered against her skin.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Are you ready?"
     </i>
     Agatha purred in a whisper, a soft request for consent in a moment when she knew she was holding all of the power.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Please, Agatha,"
     </i>
     was the only response that Rio could manage to force out.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment she felt Agatha slide inside of her? Rio's head whipped back, a loud and rumbling moan escaping her, nearly rattling the windows. Judging by the pressure of Agatha's grip on her hip, it was obvious that it had struck something deep within her.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been enough room between Rio and the back hatch of the car that she had not really been worried about their positioning, but as time started to wear (though how much was beyond Rio's comprehension) she could feel Agatha's pace increasing. Something, though, was missing. It almost froze Rio to try and even consider asking, but she found her way through the pleasure to produce a single word.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "More."
     </i>
     It was a cross between a whimper and a plea, something Rio wanted, but also could hardly think to ask for.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's motions slowed before she pulled back in order to flip down her index finger to join the middle two. This time, her hand that had been lodged on Rio's hip slid up, palm resting flat on the small of Rio's back. Flexing her fingertips slightly into the fabric of the t-shirt, she pressed into Rio again.
    </p>
<p>
     The stretch wasn't unbearable, but it was a new feeling, one that shook Rio's limbs as though she couldn't stay steady. Agatha slowly developed a new rhythm, but the pace quickened within thirty seconds. For every move she made backward, Agatha kept Rio's hips exactly where she wanted by using the pressure on her back, the force beginning to build.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a spot that she hit that caused Rio to react without thought, her hand flying up to plant a palm on the back windscreen as a shuddered moan sounded so impossibly loud around them, which seemed to only increase Agatha's vigor. And then, in an act Rio had not expected in the least, Agatha's thumb hooked over the slight protrusion of her pubic bone and curled her fingers toward it, almost trapping herself. Her movement never stopped, and though thoughts were fleeting inside Rio's mind, she immediately knew what was coming.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "A-Agatha! D-do -- ohhh! Fuck!"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In the time it had taken her to try and spit out a warning, Agatha had been completely unrelenting. Rio could feel her hand pressing harder on the small of her back as her own body began to build tension, everything flexing at once before --
    </p>
<p>
     The absolutely pleasured wail that could surely have sounded like an emergency siren in frequency and volume likely had the entire city on high alert, Rio's lungs completely deflating with the act of releasing it. Her body trembled and she was not sure how she was going to be able to hold the position she was in without continuing to use the entire force of her hand on the glass to keep her steady.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hands started wandering again. The one on her back slid around to her left hip and the other that Agatha had pulled away as Rio's very obvious and very wet orgasm had hit landed on the right one. They slid down, palms flattening against the crease that existed from the transition of ass to thigh. She scooted back on her knees and bent over, dipping her head about midway between Rio's thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was nearly oblivious of this until she felt Agatha's tongue as it pressed to the inside of one thigh, making laps. And then, the other thigh, repeating the process.
    </p>
<p>
     As truly out-of-body as Rio had thought she was? The moment she realized what Agatha was doing, she about skyrocketed out of her own physical being.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been cleaning up after herself.
    </p>
<p>
     As if that had not been enough, Agatha's palms pressed, first forward then outward.
    </p>
<p>
     The feeling of her tongue sliding into Rio's core?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been convinced that she could not have become any more pleasurably detached from her own physical body, but there was just nothing.
    </p>
<p>
     No thought.
    </p>
<p>
     No more sounds.
    </p>
<p>
     No movement.
    </p>
<p>
     Just pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio's entire palm pressed flat to the inside of that window.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Agatha's hand reached around and she felt fingertips across her clit? That seemed to yank her right back into the moment, a moan tearing out of her, fingertips attempting to dig into glass to try and ground herself.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "My love,"
     </i>
     Rio forced out in a whimper, but this only seemed to quicken Agatha's pace.
     <i>
      "A-Agatha, I... I'm -- oh! I'm going to come!"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Absolutely nothing slowed that woman down, and Rio was sure of that as yet another damn near violent orgasm ripped through her body, leaving her crying out like someone may as well have been trying to kill her, just with tones that rang clearly, soaked in sheer bliss instead.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did not trust her own stability, even as she felt the cold air replace Agatha's face on her skin. Her chest was positively heaving and she could hardly find it in her to get her head to stop spinning. She wasn't sure how much time had passed, but she felt Agatha's hands back on her sides, slowly sliding around her ribs to between her breasts, where they both pressed flatly. Rio could feel the gentle pressure there, beguiling her to move. She caved, using every bit of strength she could muster to push off of the window and heed Agatha's request.
    </p>
<p>
     As her spine straightened, Agatha's front was back against her back and her arms surrounded her. On arm hooked across her middle and the other crossed over her chest, holding her tight as she hooked a chin over Rio's shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head turned, nuzzling into the side of Rio's head. She inhaled slowly, breathing in the familiar scent of wildflowers and jasmine. The most self-satisfied hum vibrated every bit of Rio's ear she needed to hear, her skin sheeting with goosebumps.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "That was delicious,"
     </i>
     Agatha cooed at her, leaning her head over just enough to place a kiss atop Rio's hair, taking in another long breath.
    </p>
<p>
     Although Rio reached up, bending her arm back to run her fingers through Agatha's hair, words were still escaping her. Hell, she still had no idea how she was even upright.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she just took the moments to heave, to slow her heartbeat.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio realized that she'd needed some time to remember what it was to be human and not a damn goddess. That had been transcendental, an out of body experience that she'd never once experience before in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     They were an organized tangle like that until she found it in herself to move, even an inch. Her arm lowered and the one that she hadn't even known had landed on Agatha's across her middle dropped, too. She turned her head, just enough to catch Agatha's lips with her own in a soft, undemanding kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, Rio found her voice as her eyes popped open and flashed in question.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha Harkness, did you literally lick the cum off of my legs?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's grin against her lips was instant and Rio didn't even need to see it to know how proud it was.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Are you mad about it?"
     </i>
     she murmured huskily.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mad in the insane way, not the angry one."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Well,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed, squeezing Rio a little tighter to her, though every place she was touching was innocuous and innocent.
     <i>
      "What are you going to do about it?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes slid closed and she reached up, picking up Agatha's hand that was on her chest. Slowly but deliberately, she brought it up to her face, pressing Agatha's first three fingers into her mouth, sucking on them softly.
    </p>
<p>
     The absolutely guttural groan that rumbled out of Agatha like lightning wasn't the only way she reacted. Rio could feel Agatha's nipples stiffening against the muscle of her back. Her lips fought to smirk, but she was a little too occupied by what she was doing. It lingered only a moment longer before she released them and let go of Agatha's hand, though it hovered for just a moment before Rio pushed it away and began to move.
    </p>
<p>
     It took some calculating, but she was able to get herself turned around so that she and Agatha were chest to chest with only that t-shirt keeping them from skin on skin, Rio's hand sliding up into her hair to pull her in for another heated lip lock.
    </p>
<p>
     More tongues. More teeth. More moans and groans that were swallowed whole.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips pulled from Agatha's though, but she was not met with protest. Instead, she shifted enough so that she could duck her head, wasting no time in pulling one of Agatha's nipples into her mouth, her hand raising to caress and pinch the other, tugging with her fingers in unison with her teeth, which happened to draw out an entire symphony of sounds from Agatha's chest.
    </p>
<p>
     It drew on for a long few moments and Agatha's hand had landed  in Rio's hair, fingers gripping tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio drew back, a soft
     <i>
      pop!
     </i>
     sounding as she released the flesh of Agatha's breast from between her lips, a smirk finding them immediately. She was not entirely done yet, though. Her head simply moved to the other side and resumed her work. This time, though, her other hand did not join in.
    </p>
<p>
     It instead landed on the top of Agatha's thigh. Nails pressed, dragging up her skin toward her hip.
    </p>
<p>
     Between the panting, the whining, and the moaning? Rio had Agatha melted down to molten gold. She was hers to shape, to mold, to bend to her will and she was eating up every single moment of it.
    </p>
<p>
     She passed the outside of her destination, still raking those deep lines into Agatha's skin. Slowly, she moved her hand back down, just fingertips this time. She rotated her wrist, flipping her hand palm side up so that she could press forward, a thrilled giggle spilling from her the moment her touch was enveloped by Agatha's dripping sex.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Are you sure you didn't already come?"
     </i>
     Rio had pulled away enough to ask before she resumed the work with her mouth and with her hand, working in tandem.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh, I did. Twice."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had the briefest thought: She'd thought that had happened to her, but it had seemed insane because Agatha hadn't touched her at the time.
    </p>
<p>
     Turned out? It wasn't as crazy as she thought it might have been.
    </p>
<p>
     Every brush of that little bundle of nerves sent Agatha trembling for just a brief moment, but then she would try to ground herself again, which only ever seemed to work for a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     In a sudden rush of movement, Rio's mouth swept to Agatha's neck, teeth nipping at the skin there at the exact same moment Rio pressed her hand forward, her fingers curling up inside of Agatha, who nearly shouted, her hand flying up to brace herself against the roof of the SUV.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio was inside of Agatha? She knew every single button to push.
    </p>
<p>
     Even more than that, she could feel acutely every time it worked.
    </p>
<p>
     The lips and teeth and hickeys and bite marks were littered over the entire right side of Agatha's neck and shoulder as Rio worked more fervently, but she wanted more.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled her hand back, catching Agatha's gaze as her eyes whipped open in dissatisfaction.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio met her evenly, her jaw setting for just a moment as she worked to embolden herself to say what it was she was fighting to say.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Turn around. Chest on the ground."
     </i>
     Her commands were not harsh or demanding, but it was clear that she was not exactly asking.
     <i>
      "Ass up."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha looked like someone had just struck her with a taser. In fact, it almost looked like she did not understand that the request had come from the woman before her. One brow raised, her head tipping as if to ask if she had been unclear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Well?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That was all the more prompting Agatha had needed before she began to clamor around to accommodate.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio sat there on her knees, watching Agatha make herself vulnerable like that? Sure, they were absolute sex-crazed in the moment, but for those few brief moments, Rio realized just how much Agatha trusted her.
    </p>
<p>
     She shuffled forward on her knees, one of her hands palming an ass cheek before she stepped, for one split second, out of character. Her hand lifted, but it swung back forward, making a
     <i>
      smack
     </i>
     sound against Agatha's skin, and also drawing a high-pitched moan that Rio had never heard before.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head fell to her wrists, nearly face-to-face with that annoying fabric.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio repositioned herself behind Agatha, one hand slid up her bare back to wrap her hand in Agatha's hair, a firm hold. She reached down between them, her fingertips brushing over the soft folds of such intimate skin before she pressed inside of her again, not even needing to ask what she needed to be doing. Three fingers seemed to be the sweet spot for both of them, but this was a little different.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had more angle here. She had more leverage than being bent over that huge counter.
    </p>
<p>
     And by gods, Rio was going to use it to her advantage.
    </p>
<p>
     She had started slow, but the rhythm built easily and the way Agatha's hips kept rocking back into hers even without her pulling on that grip in her hair?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio got it. She got how she didn't even have to be touched to experience an orgasm when it came to Agatha. Still, she didn't stop and poured every bit of her concentration into the task before her.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel it as it built, Agatha's body growing more and more tight, filling with more and more tension.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a gentle but firm tug on Agatha's hair, pulling her head back as she shifted the angle of her work, which immediately seemed to take.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "N-no. Nonononono,"
     </i>
     Agatha whined, but Rio understood that it was not a request for her to stop. It was a realization that something else was coming.
    </p>
<p>
     With just one more minor adjustment to position, everything in Agatha's body locked up and the pure force with which Rio's fingers were constricted and then pushed out with the force of the entirely new brand of orgasm Rio had never witnessed out of her before.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was right.
    </p>
<p>
     That was the hottest thing Rio had ever seen in her entire life.
    </p>
<p>
     Not only was there proof of what she had done all over her hands and the tops of her thighs, but Agatha had been in a position that she had not really been able to collapse anymore. She was still shaking like an absolute leaf in the wind, but Rio knew that it was her own doing, and would be every single time they did this dance.
    </p>
<p>
     That after-care part of her brain took over though and she moved around to Agatha's side, pulling her up and into her arms as they slumped back against the side of the car, Rio's head tilting back against the window as Agatha's still trembling body curled into her side. Her breathing was heavy and uneven, catching every other breath.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just held her, rubbing smoothing paths with her palm over Agatha's arm. She lifted her head from the glass and pressed her lips to the top of Agatha's head, her fingers on her free hand moving to twist strands of Agatha's hair around them.
    </p>
<p>
     It took several more minutes before Agatha seemed to find the ability to operate again.
    </p>
<p>
     She lifted her head, those gorgeous fucking eyes finding Rio's, though there was a devilish smirk on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I think I owe Taylah a new car."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The reaction?
    </p>
<p>
     That reaction was simply the purest harmony of laughter Rio was sure she'd ever heard in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     And it felt absolutely incredible.

<p>
     It could have been two minutes, it could have been twenty and Rio would have had no clue in the world. Time, it didn't really matter anyway. It was a construct, a supposed natural progression to life. When it came to the reality of life, of knowing another human being? Time was an inadequate way of trying to measure what a relationship was worth.
    </p>
<p>
     Nearly a month without Agatha before actually knowing her had been shitty, but it had been bearable. Rio had managed to get through it out of nothing but sheer will and determination.
    </p>
<p>
     The last three days?
    </p>
<p>
     The last three days had been misery in its purest, most raw form. It had been an entirely new pain that Rio had convinced herself was all contrived inside of her own mind. What she had realized the moment Agatha had been able to get her hands on her?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had felt the exact same way.
    </p>
<p>
     That hadn't just been hard, or even only uncomfortable. The distance had hurt. It seemed insane, as most things did when it came to their relationship, to think that she could hardly get over herself long enough to spend a few days away from Agatha without feeling like she wasn't whole anymore. It was codependency at it's finest, and she was well aware, but that could be a therapy session a year down the road.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then?
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, Rio had her one true love pressed into her side, her breathing falling so even that Rio began to question if she had fallen asleep. She had instantly decided that if she had, she was going to let her sleep for a little bit. She'd just spent over twelve hours on a plane and there was no doubt in Rio's mind that she was completely exhausted.
    </p>
<p>
     After however fucking long that whole escapade was? It would have been no wonder if she'd passed out even sooner.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, though? Rio was fucking
     <i>
      buzzing.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was like a film in her head, one she would watch through and then immediately hammer down on the rewind button so she could relive it over and over again. Even just thinking about it sent a ripple of heat up her spine. It was a memory she could get lost in, a memory that she could wrap herself in and feel warm for the rest of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     On about her third playthrough, she was snapped out of it by the softest brushing of lips against the crook of her neck. Her eyes slid shut as she drew in a breath, exhaling it in a soft hum.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Did you enjoy your nap?"
     </i>
     Rio murmured softly at her, turning to place a kiss on the tip of her nose.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I fell asleep?"
     </i>
     Agatha asked back, though the grogginess in her tone indicated that she had indeed dozed, at the very least.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "In your defense, you sort of did fly six thousand miles right before running a marathon..."
     </i>
     Rio offered, though it was difficult to keep the joy of her smile out of her voice.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "How about we go home? The kids are at the big house for the night, so it's just me and you and our boathouse."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's breath lodged midway in her throat the moment it had hit her ears, and it wasn't because of that shimmer in Agatha's eyes that likely indicated the night had only just begun.
    </p>
<p>
     It had always been
     <i>
      the
     </i>
     boathouse. But that wasn't what Agatha had said.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Our boathouse.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's palm lifted from its hold on Agatha's arm and raised so that she could hook a couple of fingers under her chin, enough to tilt her head up to press their lips together in an impossibly soft and gentle kiss, one that she tried to use to pour just a little more love into the woman in her grasp.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yeah, babe, let's go home."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     So began the task of locating every discarded item of clothing and trying to get it on without being able to stand to full height. It was pretty comical in its own right, and when Agatha had tried to straighten up and completely smacked her head into the roof? Rio's immediate reaction had been to show concern and ask her if she was okay, but the moment Agatha burst into laughter? Rio couldn't help but to cave and join her.
    </p>
<p>
     Once dressed, they climbed out of the back, soles of shoes scuffing the ground. What Rio had not been expecting was for Agatha to nearly swoon into her, though she was quick to catch her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Well, hi,"
     </i>
     Rio crooned, pressing her lips to Agatha's hairline.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I just needed one more full body hug before I drive us home."
     </i>
     Though Rio sensed that Agatha was being sincere in her plans, she would definitely have to wrestle her for the keys, and that would have been quite the feat given how sleepy she looked.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "How about you play passenger princess for the night?"
     </i>
     Rio coaxed, a light fingertip tracing up and down Agatha's back.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha responded with a whine of disapproval, headbutting Rio's nose playfully, which left her both rolling her eyes and laughing at the immaturity of it all. The most amusing part about it was that Agatha was almost always so poised, so damn regal because the world looked at her in a certain regard. When it was just the two of them? Agatha didn't have to impress Rio, and she'd known that since day one. It was perhaps one of the biggest proponents that had led them back to one another.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come on, my love. Home awaits us."
     </i>
     For the second time that night, Rio gave a playful swat to one side of Agatha's ass right as she stole a brief peck. As she started to pull away, Agatha's arms only tightened, pulling Rio back closer, which both softened her and caused a smile to pull at her lips.
     <i>
      "Baby, I'm just going to the other side of the car."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know,"
     </i>
     Agatha mumbled back, tilting her head to press their lips together one last time before she released her hold so that they could load back into the car. Although the moment the doors both shut, sheepish grins filled their faces, they did not actually turn to look at one another. Instead, Agatha's hand reached between the space that filled the two seats and set her hand on Rio's thigh, giving it a light squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio honestly felt like a couple of teenagers as they had driven back to the water, one of her hands on the steering wheel and the other wrapped around Agatha's in its spot on her leg. She was home.
    </p>
<p>
     She was really, really home.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio already felt whole again, like everything that had been dulled was suddenly bright again. Agatha was her light in many ways, but as it turned out? Rio simply seemed to be at her happiest when Agatha was around, and she had never been more convinced than she was in those moments.
    </p>
<p>
     The car? Well, that had been a topic of discussion on the way back, too. They had ultimately decided that they would go the next day so that Agatha could purchase the new one, and then they would figure out to do with that one. That was definitely not something that would be kept for sentimental reasons, and Rio voicing that had them both in stitches again.
    </p>
<p>
     The sun had gone down in their time still at the airport, but the dash read that it was just after 9 pm, to which Agatha had announced that the night was still young. That little ornery ring in her tone held some weight to it, though Rio did not pry. Instead, she had pulled into a market parking lot and told Agatha to sit tight while she ran inside.
    </p>
<p>
     Less than five minutes later, she was back with only a lone bag in her hand. She slid back into the driver's seat, casually handing the bag over to Agatha who immediately looked inside.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ice cream?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's grin filled her face almost instantly and she offered a gentle shrug as the engine turned over and she put the SUV into reverse.
    </p>
<p>
     "I figured a sweet treat won't be so bad a 2 am."
    </p>
<p>
     The soft little
     <i>
      hm
     </i>
     that was almost too quiet to be heard pulled a giggle from Rio's lips as they set to finish their journey home. She also realized in that moment that Agatha had perhaps been expecting a different answer, one that might have been a little less innocent. Still, the idea didn't seem to her like a bad one, at least.
    </p>
<p>
     It had only been a couple of minutes more before they were climbing out of the car in the lot of the marina, Agatha coming around with her bag to meet Rio at the front, their hands joining instantaneously to head back to their home.
    </p>
<p>
     Once inside, Rio had stowed the ice cream in the freezer as Agatha had announced that she was going to get a shower started for them, which pushed and pulled Rio's middle in several different ways. Obviously, what had unfolded in the back of that car was still very vivid in her mind, and Rio had surely missed that physical intimacy. The shower, though? That was an entirely different level of intimacy that she'd missed almost a little more.
    </p>
<p>
     She had taken the time to get them each a glass of water that she placed on their nightstands as she heard Agatha turn on the water around the corner.
    </p>
<p>
     "Baby?" Agatha's voice sounded.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, my love?" Rio posed back, loud enough to be hear but not quite a shout.
    </p>
<p>
     "Could you bring my toiletry bag when you come in?" she posed sweetly. "It's in my duffel."
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio placed her own glass down and paced back across the room to Agatha's bag, squatting down as she unzipped it. The smaller bag was not visible upon first glance, but Rio had little reserves in rooting around for it, and had started to do so. Within a moment, she had been pushing clothes around, but her hand brushed something that had a texture her brain could not process.
    </p>
<p>
     Her brow pinched slightly and she pushed a few pairs of Agatha's pants back to at least identify what it had been. It wasn't glass, wasn't plastic. As she moved another shirt, her eyes landed on it.
    </p>
<p>
     All at once, Rio's eyes widened, her jaw dropped and her heart stilled for the entirety of about five beats. Suddenly, her mouth was as dry as the desert midday and nothing else seemed to process in her mind. No synapses were firing, no logical thought to be had.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was not a prude. In fact, she had been incredibly lonely most of her life but that had not ever really detracted from her libido. She had used many a dildoes in her life, but she had never seen one like
     <i>
      that.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It wasn't the size; that wasn't that intimidating. It was the structure. One side, it was bulbous but then pinched toward the base, which seemed to curve in a very specific way before it jutted out in the protrusion, a few small ribs of the purple silicone at the base.
    </p>
<p>
     It was like her brain was nothing more than a computer that had just installed an update; she was loading, trying to input all of the information that was right before her eyes. The moment she understood the mechanics of it, Agatha's voice called from the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened her mouth to answer, but nothing came out. Instead, she was smothered by the new found heat that was seated in her core.
    </p>
<p>
     "Baby?"
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, she blinked back to the moment and reached back into the bag to complete her intended task, but she had not put the dildo down. Instead, she found her way back to the bathroom, not at all surprised but still breathless at the sight of Agatha naked. She had crossed half the bathroom in an attempt to check on Rio, but the moment she saw her in the doorway?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes flashed, pooling almost instantly with panic as her lips turned down at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
     "That was supposed to be a conversation," Agatha admitted, breathing a soft sigh through her nose as her eyes fell to the floor. "I didn't even think about it when I asked you."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's response was an understandable one, but she had immediately misread Rio's demeanor entirely.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pressed forward, setting both items in her hands on the sink before she turned back to face Agatha, reaching up to slide her palms around her jaw, a silent request for eye contact. Agatha obliged after a moment, their eyes meeting in that bright light of the bathroom.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hey, I'm not upset,"
     </i>
     Rio informed her, both thumbs brushing along the peaks of her cheekbones.
     <i>
      "I was just... caught off guard. And... honestly? It is kind of hot."
     </i>
     The smile that found Rio's face time was a little contradictory to her words. Yes, she meant them, but her expression held more of an affectionate warmth than her words might have indicated.
    </p>
<p>
     The truth was, the longer she thought about it, the more Rio could see it for what it was.
    </p>
<p>
     It was possible that this was something Agatha had done with women over the years since her divorce, yes.
    </p>
<p>
     But for them?
    </p>
<p>
     It was Agatha's way of getting as near as she could. It was her way of fulfilling that need to just be close. Maybe it would have seemed outlandish to anyone else, but to Rio it made sense. It wasn't just about the sex itself, it was about the familiarity and comfortability that the two of them had been able to find within that physical proximity.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could see it, the panic as it began to melt away from Agatha's beautiful face. As she spoke, Rio was almost certain that it was the smallest she'd ever heard Agatha's voice be.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I really did intend on talking to you about it first,"
     </i>
     she voiced, though Rio did not offer any other answer than placing their lips together in a tame kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know you did, Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio soothed back, stealing another peck.
     <i>
      "As much of a little devil as you can be sometimes, I don't believe you asked me to look for your toiletry bag in some ploy for me to find it instead. Especially with the way you looked like you were five seconds from a heart attack when you saw me holding it."
     </i>
     Rio's lips hitched again, though her giggle was light in the acoustics of the room they were in.
    </p>
<p>
     At almost the same time, both of their eyes dropped to the counter and their laughter filled the room. Rio's head turned back toward Agatha, the laughter still sweet on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... the mechanics? It's essentially double ended but... way hotter?" Rio posed and Agatha's grin was bright but not embarrassed in the least.
    </p>
<p>
     "Correct. And, it's a lot less hassle to deal with than straps or boxers," Agatha explained, her voice so thick with the most delectable mixture of excitement, curiosity, and adoration for this woman she loved who seem to simply roll with the punches. Agatha's face was soft, though her smile was still so bright.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't anticipation, it was the relief of being understood without having to defend herself.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "C'mere, you,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed at her, pulling her close with the leverage her hold had on Agatha's face, their lips brushing just barely at first before Rio met her in a full kiss. It wasn't an aggressive or passionate kiss, but one that was filled with the pure love Rio held within her for the indescribable woman before her.
    </p>
<p>
     She had started to feel like words didn't do it, even more than she ever had. Rio had not ever been anyone to struggle when trying to articulate herself, but the things she felt for Agatha? Were there even words that could harness that unbridled devotion? She was convinced that there were not.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Let's shower,"
     </i>
     Rio offered as their lips parted, her green eyes flickering open to behold her fiancée with a slight curve of her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned in, stealing another soft kiss as her hands found the hem of Rio's shirt to begin the process of stripping her down. Rio had almost started to help her, but the moment Agatha started placing soft kisses across her shoulder, over her chest and down her middle as she knelt to remove Rio's shorts?
    </p>
<p>
     It was a show of worship, she was completely aware, but this type of reverence out of Agatha felt different. It wasn't hungry or rushed. It didn't feel like it had when they had been stood there outside of the car in a stare off that had only been initiated because Rio had hardly been able to understand what was actually happening.
    </p>
<p>
     The way Agatha's icy gaze lifted to hers as she placed a tender kiss to Rio's hip?
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      I will never love anyone the way I love Agatha.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The thought was loud in its assertion, and it was one that had crossed her mind before, but in that very second, she could not have been more convinced.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio coaxed her up and they had set about their work, showering with the most utter respect and appreciation for one another's bodies. Shower sex could be great, sure, but there was something so much more pure about what that time meant for them. It was a display of not just trust, but of relief that they could share in something that no one else in the world needed to know about. It was just them, in that tiny corner of that tiny houseboat, and not a thing outside that bathroom door could ever matter more in those moments.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd dried off and returned to the bedroom, opting only to put on shirts and little else. Agatha had rummaged around in her bag as Rio pulled one of her own shirts over her head. Rio placed herself on the bed, leaning back against the headboard as Agatha straightened, an article of clothing balled up in her hand. Her brow was pinched, Rio could tell even from the side. Before she could question it aloud, Agatha held up a finger in request for a moment, as if she had known it was coming, and disappeared inside the closet.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had picked up her phone to check it but was met with no notifications. She had started to scroll, but movement in the closet doorway caught her attention. Her eyes flickered up and for the umpteenth time that night, Rio's ability to breathe was severely impaired.
    </p>
<p>
     There, bare legged all the way up to mid hip, stood Agatha with not only the most wicked grin on her lips, but clad in only Rio's All Blacks jersey.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio understood, in that moment, why Agatha had nearly lost her entire mind when she saw her in that Trojans shirt. It didn't make a great deal of logical sense as to why it was so hot, but Rio could hardly contain the overwhelming swell of both captivation and attraction. Agatha did not have to try to be sexy, she just
     <i>
      was.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Of course, she was putting very clear effort into it, but Rio was flattered by the show nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Get over here, you little asshole,"
     </i>
     Rio crooned at her, patting the spot beside her on the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grin never once dimmed as she paced over to her side of the bed and placed herself directly next to Rio, the side of their thighs flush against each other. She had started to sink into the comfort of being home, but Rio had a little more to say about Agatha's current state of dress.
    </p>
<p>
     A lot to say, but no words to say it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's right arm crossed her body as she shifted her weight so that she could take a good handful of the kit material, pulling Agatha halfway to meet her in a hungry kiss that still had an underlying tenderness to it.
    </p>
<p>
     The truth was, Rio seemed to convince herself at the end of each day that there was no possible way she could love Agatha more than she did when she closed her eyes to sleep. By the end of every single next day, though, she was left feeling that way again. It was this repeating cycle of being so enchanted to the point of disbelief time and time again and somehow being shocked that the results never stayed where she thought they would.
    </p>
<p>
     While elevated in its intensity, that kiss stayed pretty surface level for the moments it lasted. It wasn't a full on panic to devour one another, but something more along the lines of a silent conversation that needed to be had.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio pulled away, her eyes flickered open into Agatha's and her smile was instant.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's so good to have you home," Rio informed her, her tones low and smooth. Her grip released on the kit and her hand raised, palm cupped around Agatha's cheek so that she could steal one more soft peck.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not half as good as it feels to be home," Agatha returned, reaching for Rio's hand that was between them as Rio retracted the other and leaned back against the headboard again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's focus shifted down to that contact and her lips twisted in thought for a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was only three days," Rio voiced softly, her thumb rubbing over the back of Agatha's knuckles. "And I felt insane the entire time for how much I missed you." She paused, though she felt Agatha's grip tighten on her hand, as if encouraging her to keep going, so she pressed on. "And I'm not so disillusioned to think that we will never have to be apart again, but..."
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could finish the thought, Agatha was speaking.
    </p>
<p>
     "But... Where we are right now in the trajectory of
     <i>
      us
     </i>
     as a couple, we simply weren't ready."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked over at Agatha, her brow pinching slightly in a twisting of emotion she was struggling to identify. She was doing it again, that thing where she was listening in on Rio's internal monologue.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gripped Agatha's hand a little harder though she was still not looking back at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "I wanted to be," Rio tried to explain. "And I think some day, I will be. But for now... I like it best when you're next to me."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head lifted and turned, that softheartedness she could hide from others but never from Rio smoothed her expression over and her head tilted to the side.
    </p>
<p>
     "I like that best, too."
    </p>
<p>
     They concurrently leaned into one another, their lips pressing softly together in an exchange of the roots that the sentiment they'd shared held. As they parted, Agatha was quick to nudge and prod Rio into lifting her arm so that she could fasten herself against her side, head resting on the front of her shoulder with an arm slung across Rio's midsection.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd sat like that for a good while, the show Rio had put on her laptop across the room playing quietly in the room around them. The words felt a little overused at that point and so to just physically soak up the company? It seemed to be what they needed.
    </p>
<p>
     Ten minutes passed, then twenty. After over forty minutes, Rio craned her neck forward to try and gauge if Agatha was asleep, but the movement alerted her and she lifted her head from Rio's shoulder, their eyes meeting in the flickering light of the laptop screen.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What are you thinking about, love? You've been awfully quiet."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha did not answer immediately. Instead, her fingertips began to rub the fabric of Rio's t-shirt between them, picking and pulling as she slowly simmered over the words she best wanted to use to convey what had been on her mind.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I went to see Jack for a little bit while I was gone. He... Long story short, his girlfriend is part of one of Hollywood's most idolized dynasties. Anyone who knows anything about the music scene twenty years ago knows who Walker Landon was, and who he became."
     </i>
     Agatha paused, pressing her lips together in thought for just a beat.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "He also has nine children that are impossibly talented in unimaginable ways. They act, they make music, they play professional football. I mean, it's literally insane."
     </i>
     Agatha breathed a soft laugh.
     <i>
      "Walker and his daughter Lizzie are also my main contacts when I need original songs for a great deal of my films. So... Showing up to spend a little bit of time with Jack and Thea ended up in a two hour debacle of seeing the Landons."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha stopped and took a slow breath, her eyes shifting back down to Rio's lap for a moment as she debated how to proceed.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Seeing their family dynamic has always fascinated me because I never understood it. Nine children is... a lot. And just how much love he and his wife have for them? It's astounded me. I mean, I love my son to the fullest extent, but to do it nine times over? It's always been... this beautiful mystery."
     </i>
     She breathed an airy chuckle.
     <i>
      "But.. my own family has tripled since the last time I had been to see them. I've found the kind of love the two of them share, and I've gained children I didn't know I needed."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The longer Agatha spoke, the more Rio was struggling to keep her emotions in check. There was so much to unpack there on so many different layers.
    </p>
<p>
     Firstly, Agatha had done as Rio had asked of her. She had reached out to someone who was willing to support her and help her through something she did not want to be dealing with. As it had turned out, she'd had a bigger net than she had ever let on to, and that warmed Rio's heart on her behalf.
    </p>
<p>
     Second, listening to Agatha as she explained what all her support entailed and then head straight into talking about her and her girls like that? Rio was touched, but she was also moved. She had known from the moment the five of them were in a room together for the first time that what they had was special, something that couldn't be duplicated. They were five adults coming together with the understanding that the universe had bound them in an inexplicable way.
    </p>
<p>
     Third, something in Rio felt so impossibly comforted at not only what Agatha was saying, but the tone with which she chose to deliver that message.  It was so smooth, but also rich with intent. Agatha was conveying that sense of wonder while also displaying her ability to recognize just how much her own life had changed in that direction. It had surely not been a path she had ever been able to envision for herself, and that was why she had been so struck by previous sights of it on full display.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips parted, but then sealed again as she seemed to battle herself on letting the words come out. She took in a slow breath, her eyes shifting to take in the woman she loved.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "My only regret is that it's just a little too late to have a child or our own to raise. Because... for as much as I fucked up Nicky because of my own inability to accept myself for who I was... I sometimes think about the kind of person you and I could raise together."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She was not sure at what point it had started, but by the time Agatha had finished speaking, Rio realized that her cheeks were wet as a result of the tears leaking from her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha..."
     </i>
     she attempted, but it came out a little strangled. She didn't really even know what it was she was going to say. A simple 'I love you' didn't feel like enough in the moment.
     <i>
      "I... I need you to know that whatever choices we make, or whatever direction life pulls us... I am so irrevocably tied to you, bound in a way I could never find it in myself to describe. And I... I just..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio stopped herself, her lips thin in a tight line as she searched for the resolve to keep going.
     <i>
      "I know it makes sense to you, and that I don't have to explain it. But you've been a part of me since the moment I touched your hand, and I will learn to cope with your absence. I just... I know that I can sit here and tell you that I love you, that you mean so impossibly much to me. I can tell you that I can't wait for the rest of our lives together, but it all feels so... inadequate."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned into her a bit more, pressing their lips together in a brief kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know, my love. Because I feel that way, too and the best way, in my panicked frenzy of trying to do so is what leads me into trying to show you instead."
     </i>
     Agatha's voice was still soft, still velvet and silk, but there was an understanding that Rio could hear clear as day. Her hand raised, pushing a few strands of Rio's still-damp hair behind her ear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Am I completely enthralled with every inch, divot, and curve of your body? Without question. But... getting to pay you that kind of attention, getting to make you feel
      <b>
       that
      </b>
      good? It's my way of telling you that I see every bit of you, and I'm at my absolute best when you feel so incredible that the rest of the world doesn't even exist."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Another pause, another stolen lip lock.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You are the reason, the one in all of the meaningless tragedy, for me. Even though I knew I was going to be miserable, you still encouraged me to find a way to find some sense of peace, and I should have known it, but you were right."
     </i>
     Agatha's lips hitched up in a smile as her fingertips brushed over Rio's cheek.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I usually am,"
     </i>
     Rio teased back softly in a way that had pointed Agatha's usual rhetoric right back at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved in a way that Rio had not been expecting; she first sat up which caused Rio's arm to loosen and drop from where it had been around her shoulders. She didn't stay there long, instead moving so that she could place herself on the tops of Rio's thighs, her hands landing on Rio's stomach between them.
    </p>
<p>
     At that moment, there was nothing overtly enticing about the act. It didn't matter that they were only clad in t-shirts and nothing else. What mattered was that overwhelming tenderness that filled Agatha's entire being from her posture to that look in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     One of her hands raised, the backs of her knuckles caressing the soft flesh of Rio's cheek. After only a moment of the contact, it shifted so that her thumb graced so lightly over Rio's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     The pure and raw emotion that was spilling out of her at just the contact was enough to cause the backs of Rio's eyes to sting with the threat of pouring.
    </p>
<p>
     She had never felt so... seen.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted a bit, raising on her knees so that she was positioned in a way that allowed her to tilt Rio's chin up as her own head tilted down, damn hair cascading over her shoulder as their eyes met across that small space. It was this moment, completely frozen in time, where Rio understood -- despite how much she had insisted it had happened before -- what it was like when someone comprehended everything there was to know about you simply by the look in their eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio head tipped back just a little more of her own accord, a silent plea for contact that Agatha recognized and obliged without hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     That kiss was like so many before it and yet? Something about it rang so different, so out of what was considered to be normal for this type of exchange between them. There was the usual passion, the common welled love between them. But the way Agatha was kissing her right then? Without any pressure or sense of being rushed, Agatha was finding some way to show her through even that light contact of their lips that she was the gold in Agatha's life, the most precious commodity she could get her hands on.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was her whole world, and she was making it known in the most gently loud fashion she could.
    </p>
<p>
     The innocent contact was enough of a shout, but it slowly wore on, growing in heat and slowly creeping up in intensity. It wasn't rushed, wasn't something that she had to push. It was just natural in the way that they both seemed to keep building onto the message they were each trying to convey.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no initial appetite, no pained hunger that they were trying to fill.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, it was just nearly ten minutes of soft lips, gentle caresses and an exchange of the kind of love that Rio had thought could only exist in dreams.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the first moment in her life that she could have labeled 'undeniably perfect' and not had a second thought about it.
    </p>
<p>
     As the clocked ticked on, exceeding that ten minutes, something began to shift.
    </p>
<p>
     Their lips pulled apart and even as Rio backed up enough to take in the sight of Agatha, her eyes stayed shut. For as much as Rio would have loved to lose herself in those deep blue pools, she was actually thankful for the act. It allowed her to lean forward, to place the softest of kisses on each of her eyelids before she moved to her nose -- one of Rio's favorite of Agatha's defining features -- and kissed the length from the tip to the spot between her brows where faint wrinkles that looks like 1's were still visible on either side of the bridge.
    </p>
<p>
     She placed her lips lovingly to Agatha's forehead, then to each cheek a couple of times a piece. She moved along, paving her path of kisses around every inch of Agatha's jaw on one side down to her chin and back up the other before she pulled away, leaning more into the pillows behind her so that she could look up at her.
    </p>
<p>
     The expression on Agatha's face, while somewhat helpless, was also a clear showing of what that kind of attention had done to her; she was nothing more than ice cream on a hundred degree day, having completely melted from her true form of the powerful and cocky woman who ran a large portion of Hollywood with ease.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, the Agatha that was on her lap half dressed covered in the pinkest dusting of a blush was pliable and smitten and Rio was all too aware. Seeing it on full display like this, though, had struck something in her, and she couldn't help but to voice it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I've made up my mind,"
     </i>
     Rio announced, though her tone still held a ring of sincerity to it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked confused for a moment, staring ahead into Rio's eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "My soul will know yours in any life. I just know it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     As the words seemed to register with Agatha, Rio could see the exact moment they wrapped around the stem of her brain and settled comfortably. The moment it stilled, the tears came. They were quick and quiet, not accompanied by any sob or cry. It dawned on Rio that Agatha was feeling it too.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was realizing what Rio had just moments before.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was realizing for the first time just how much Rio meant it when she said she saw her for who she truly was, and had always chosen to love her anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment was charged in its emotional weight, but it settled around them in silence, each of them caressing the other on whatever patch of skin they could reach. Another breath passed between them and Agatha leaned forward again, this time to press her forehead to Rio's, though Rio did not miss the expression on her face as she did so; Agatha was struggling to convey what she was feeling, and Rio could almost sense it coming.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You are forever a part of me, Rio."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes flickered open into Rio's at the same moment that Rio touched her chin, lifting it just enough. Her other hand reached for Agatha's and placed it on her chest at the same time she brushed their lips together. As they separated but stayed a breath away, Rio's curled just slightly. Her grip on Agatha's hand on her chest flexed just barely.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And you're always with me, too. Right here."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Those smiles, they were a direct reflection of each other. That stillness hung for a moment longer, but they both moved at the same time, mouths meeting once more, for the millionth time in two months.
    </p>
<p>
     The kisses were slower, full to the brim with patience and appreciation. The hands that wandered took their time on both ends. The world was simply stopped around them as they simply bore their souls to one another through an exchange of lips and tongues and sighs that were savored before being swallowed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hands slid up Agatha's back, pressing between her skin and the material of the jersey, pushing it up enough that a band of it had gathered around Agatha's middle, just below her breast. For as sexy as the sight had been, it felt too out of place to be stated in that moment and Rio let it slip away from her purview.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she pushed it higher, freeing her breasts before arms were raised and it was being removed completely with Agatha's assistance. Rio's hands were back on her skin in an instant, on her ribs, her sides, her hips. No matter how many times she got Agatha naked, it never failed to completely stupefy her and cause her to forget all rational thought. As she leaned forward to let her lips travel the seas of Agatha's skin, though, she felt a gentle press on her shoulder, lightly pinning her back against the headboard.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes lifted, but it was already obvious what she wanted. Agatha's hands moved down to Rio's own t-shirt and pulled, tugging it off once Rio had raised her arms enough to accomplish such an act.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she was done, though, Agatha simply sat back, and Rio could feel with laser precision on her skin every single place where Agatha's eyes landed and searched. It created a warmth, knowing that Agatha was just... appreciating her, valuing her for all she saw in her.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, as Rio sat up, Agatha did not stop her. Rio head tipped back as Agatha's forearms landed on her shoulders, that hair spilling down to tickle Rio's skin. It pulled the fullest and quietest giggle from her lips, but it was silence as Agatha leaned down for another kiss. It was a little stronger, a little more desperate and the longer Rio engaged, the higher the heat seemed to climb.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands, as they had initially landed flat on the hind side of Agatha's ribs began to shift, sliding around her sides and down to her hips. Rio's chest was pressed to the spot just below Agatha's and her fingertips pressed in a need for closeness into her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     The kiss never broke, not for the entirety of at least three minutes, but it slowly rose in passion until they were both nearly gasping for air. Although Rio had taken the parting between them to suck in a breath, it was exhaled almost just as fast as Agatha dipped her head into the crook of Rio's neck, peppering the skin there with kisses as her own hands began to roam.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips searched every space they could reach, pulling the quietest gasps and sighs from Rio's lips with each perfect spot she touched. The more it wore on, the more she was getting to Rio in a way that this time? Rio was not sure she was trying.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time Agatha had adjusted back enough that she could kiss down Rio's torso, the mood around them had shifted. It wasn't about carnal sex, but Rio was aching to be as close to Agatha as she could get.
    </p>
<p>
     So, as Agatha's lips pressed just between her breasts, she raised a curled finger to pull at her attention. Their eyes met, Agatha looking looking up at her from beneath those perfectly curled lashes in question.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swallowed, trying to shake the way her mouth had dried up completely at the mere thought of what she wanted to verbalize.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's still in the bathroom,"
     </i>
     Rio voiced, though it sounded like she was nearly choking on the words as she tried to get them out.
    </p>
<p>
     A spark of white light flashed across pools of blue and while Rio had almost expected Agatha to fly off the bed in a race to get there as quick as she could, Agatha simply leaned up to kiss her again before separating them and casually pacing back to the bathroom. A moment later, she returned and dropped it on the bed before turning back to her bag. She straightened again, turning to make her way back toward her nightstand. She set the bottle she had pulled out on the surface and gently folded herself into the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite herself, Rio's eyes fell to the dildo in her hands for just a moment. She felt Agatha's gaze on her, though, and looked back up to see the question on Agatha's face before she asked it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Are you sure?"
     </i>
     she posed, the genuine compassion and concern audible over her words.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached over, her fingers sliding into the hair of Agatha's neck as she pulled her in for another affectionate kiss that lasted just a beat too long.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm sure."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     This time, Agatha was the one who leaned in to steal one last kiss before she leaned back, busying herself with the only-somewhat-awkward process of getting herself situated.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was honed in, completely rapt by every single move Agatha was making; the way her eyes nearly rolled back into her head as she secured the shorter end inside of herself nearly caused Rio to erupt into a full fledged bonfire. Instead, she attempted again to swipe her tongue across her lips, but it was useless in trying to drive the dryness from her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     For a few seconds, Agatha's chest rose and fell a little faster, but it quickly returned to normal. Without looking over at Rio, she picked up the bottle off of the nightstand and palmed a bit of the liquid before applying it to the newfound shaft that protruded from her body, causing Rio's soul to fight to stay contained within her physical form.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      That was fucking hot.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     As she finished, Agatha's eyes lifted to her own gaze and Rio swallowed down that absolute boulder of want that sat near the back of her throat. And when Agatha spoke? It was a wonder Rio was maintaining consciousness.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What's going to be best for you?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It probably would have moved her to tears, being asked that question, if she wasn't as turned on as she was. It still touched her in a way that caused her to lean over for just a moment, stealing a warm and full kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced down for a moment, trying to devise a plan in her own mind, but thinking about it too much was going to be her undoing. Instead, she sat up and rearranged herself on the bed to straddle Agatha's upper thighs. They were still staring at each other, this strange mix of lust and tender passion thick between them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's chin tucked toward her chest as she looked at that purple extension that stood erect before her and then fell back up toward Agatha who was wearing the most patient and understanding expression. It was the very thing that compelled Rio to move.
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward to brace herself on Agatha's abdomen as she lifted herself to her knees and scooted forward. A hand reached down between them for her own benefit, a guide for herself as she lowered her lips down, her head immediately falling back at the feeling of Agatha inside of her. What fell from her lips was not quite a moan, but a little too vocal to be a gasp.
    </p>
<p>
     In the same moment, Agatha's hands fell to her hips, her grip solid but not offering any kind of push or pull. She was just holding her. This was on Rio's terms, full stop.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio began to adjust to the fullness, it became a little easier to navigate, though as she began to slide into a gentle rhythm, her hands slowly lifted. She no longer needed the support. Instead, as she felt Agatha's hands slide to her thighs, her own hands lifted to her head, sliding into her hair that she gripped in one at the back of her head. The other hand fell back down, palm flat against her chest as her hips continued that steady movement.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes had been closed almost the whole time, but as she finally forced them open?
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression was entirely ethereal. She looked like she had completely transcended outside of time and space and any physical constraint that her worldly ties might have had to offer her. She was in heaven, if it had ever existed on earth. Her hands would glide over skin, but she did not grip or press or pull. She did not even lift her hips once.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt her power in those moments, especially as her movements became a little more rushed, a little more filled with need and frenzy. Agatha sensed this and in a sudden surge, she sat up, her arms wrapping around Rio so that her palms landed along her spine. Their fronts brushed with Rio's fervor, but Agatha's lips landed at the base of her throat, kissing every inch she could reach.
    </p>
<p>
     The more frequent Rio's little gasps became, the more it pushed Agatha closer to that edge, too.
    </p>
<p>
     In some act of what had to be sheer coincidence, Agatha's lips pressed to Rio's chest, directly above where her heart sat in her chest and she could feel in literally every single place between the two of them where muscles tensed for several seconds and then released, their moaned cries tangling together in a soft symphony of pleasure that wrapped around them like a warm blanket.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nearly folded forward into Agatha who immediately fell back into the pillows behind them, both bodies trembling steadily against one another. Agatha was the first to move, surprisingly, and turned her head enough that she could place as many kisses as Rio would allow against the side of her head, her ear, her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, it seemed like their limbs began to still and the pleasure stopped rippling as violently through them, enough that Rio could roll to Agatha's side, completely and entirely spent. Like clockwork, Agatha's arm wrapped around her shoulders and pulled her close, while at the same time reaching down to remove the appendage, discarding it somewhere to the side on the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     The laptop had since died and there was no other sound in the room aside from their labored breathing as they chose to live in the quiet bliss for just a few more moments.
    </p>
<p>
     As coherency seemed to find them again, Rio managed to pick up her head so that she could rest her chin on Agatha's chest, their eyes locking as a warm smile found Rio's lips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And that's what I got the ice cream for,"
     </i>
     Rio informed her, the most delectable giggle parting her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mmm, ice cream. That
      <b>
       was
      </b>
      a good idea,"
     </i>
     Agatha hummed back, a blithe smile curling her lips as she picked up her head, indicating she wanted a kiss, which Rio happily provided.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Want me to go get it?"
     </i>
     Rio posed, hiking up a brow in question though that stunning smile had never left her face.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "In a minute,"
     </i>
     Agatha responded reaching down with her free hand to give Rio's side a light squeeze, an indicator that she wanted more of her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     Again, Rio obliged, scooting up a little further so that she could place her lips lovingly against Agatha's in the most tender exchange. It was slow, soft and so completely undemanding for the few moments it went on, reverent in its intent.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, again surprising Rio, was the one who broke the contact, a light huff of a chuckle blowing through her nose.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I think I'm ready for ice cream now,"
     </i>
     she mused, floating the idea as though she had any doubt Rio might object. Rio's sweeping grin was so bright and full as she nearly scrambled out of bed to retrieve their treats and a couple of spoons.
    </p>
<p>
     As she returned and handed Agatha's over to her, she placed herself on the bed in a sitting position, her legs crossed in front of her in a way that left her shins pressed to Agatha's hip. They sat like that for the entire duration of time it took them to eat their pints, sharing laughter and conversation and loving brushes of skin throughout.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they had finished and placed their empty containers and dirty spoons on their respective nightstands, Rio glanced at the clock on her dresser to see that it was nearing three in the morning. She slid against Agatha's side once more, finding her home in that vastness of skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had just started to doze, but Agatha's breath hitched and a soft
     <i>
      Oh!
     </i>
     sounded around them, causing Rio to jerk her head up to find out what was happening.
    </p>
<p>
     That look on Agatha's face, though?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew that look.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was hungry again, sparked by a thought that had suddenly appeared in her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes shifted down, taking in her fiancée as her lips curled into a smirk.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "How quiet do you think you can be?"
     </i>
     she posed, that huskiness finding her tone again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's brow pinched, indicating that she didn't understand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha remained quiet for a moment, her eyes flicking from side to side as she reached Rio's face, that mischief on her own only seeming to get louder.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's 3 am and I think the likelihood, if you can be quiet, of me fucking you over the railing of the deck could be pretty high. And also, a great deal of calculated risk's worth of fun."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha!"
     </i>
     Rio shot back, her jaw dropping a little.
     <i>
      "You're insane."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "What I am not hearing yet is a no..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "...And you won't."
     </i>

<p>
     The light of the morning sun was not the first thing Rio noticed as she stirred to consciousness. Her eyes did not open, though it shone orange through her eyelids enough to notify her that the morning had come.
    </p>
<p>
     What she noticed first was that the sounds of the waves lapping against the outside of the house were almost in perfect time with the soft sounds of Agatha's breathing.
    </p>
<p>
     Each breath Agatha took, a lapping of the waves harmonized perfectly.
    </p>
<p>
     Two of Rio's favorite things, ebbing and flowing with the force impelled by the universe.
    </p>
<p>
     After just another moment of brief personal introspection, Rio's eyelids fluttered and then lifted. The light wasn't entirely too bright, but indicative of a morning that had already begun. What the light touched, though, was what drew her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     Bathed in the golden hues lay Agatha's nude form, chest down with her face pressed to the pillow in a way that Rio could see it, behold it, in all of its beauty. Though she was naked, there was a small corner of the sheet that had twisted in her slumber in a way that left it laying across the small of her back. It left the hills of her backside revealed as they transitioned into those smooth, muscular thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes swept back up, though as they hit the blanket, they slowed again. Instead, she chose to take her time in tracing those little lines, the little divots of muscle on her back, her shoulders. Agatha's arm was pulled up, tucked underneath the pillow that was pressed to her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked so... peaceful.
    </p>
<p>
     Surely, she had fallen asleep with that wicked air of smug confidence that she had surely earned herself through their little foray out on the deck the night before. It had almost seemed like doing the impossible for her to stop grinning every time they looked at each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Yes, it had been...
     <i>
      incredibly
     </i>
     hot. But there had been something else, something that Rio had not identified until she had been about to fall asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Making that kind of choice, for Rio, would have seemed out of character in any context. A woman who had not ever let anyone close enough to touch her, let alone bend her over a deck railing in a very,
     <i>
      very
     </i>
     public place no matter what time it was, made that choice. A woman who, toeing the line of forty years old, had not even so much as kissed another human being in over half of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     In those moments, the ones where she tried to choke back her pleasured cries, she had simply been a woman whose heart and body belonged entirely to Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     Had it been completely insane to even consider it? Of course. There was never much question about that, but what had come from it had been something she never could have conjured in even her wildest dreams. The freedom that she had found in her relationship with Agatha had been something she had never known was possible, and even as they fought to keep their voices subdued acting like a couple of thrill-seeing teenagers she knew that she would have
     <i>
      never
     </i>
     had that freedom with anyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's body had folded over her own, arms secured snugly around her middle as the two of them had just stared down into the water while they fought to catch their breaths.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hm"
     </i>
     Agatha had breathed into Rio's ear, like whatever she was about to say next was going to be something pointed.
     <i>
      "I think I can see your old phone."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In that one moment, it took all of five seconds for almost every memory they'd made since that day to flood her mind's eye at a breakneck speed. Rio was certain that she couldn't actually see it, but the fact that it was something she had remembered enough to crack a joke?
    </p>
<p>
     It was just yet another reason to fall in love with Agatha, as if she had needed any more.
    </p>
<p>
     The look that was on Agatha's face in that moment, though, was a snapshot of true serenity. She was where she was comfortable, she was where she was wanted and loved. Agatha was
     <i>
      home.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had carefully slipped out of bed to brush her teeth and run a brush through her hair with the intention of getting back into bed, but something else tugged at her. She paced back to the bedroom and pulled on a t-shirt and a pair of underwear. Before she made a second exit from the bedroom, though, she knelt down on the bed and leaned over her fiancée to press the softest kiss to her cheek. Rio was not surprised when she failed to stir; that wasn't the intent behind it anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     She righted herself on her feet again and made her way out into the rest of the house, heading straight for the kitchen to survey what might have been left in the refrigerator. She found four eggs and a somehow untouched pack of bangers. That, she decided, was substantial enough for a breakfast that would refuel them in some attempt at correcting the depletion of energy they had caused themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, she had set to her work. The aromas began to lift, to carry, but as she was close to finishing the task of making them food, she could hear it -- however faintly -- as Agatha's phone started to ring. Ah, she must have turned it back on before she fell asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     What perplexed Rio was that it had sounded twice, but then was silenced. With the work before her, she hadn't been able to hear Agatha's voice as she answered it.
    </p>
<p>
     She did hear it, though, when Agatha shouted.
    </p>
<p>
<b>
<i>
       "WHAT?!"
      </i>
</b>
</p>
<p>
     Eyes wide, Rio immediately dropped the spatula in her hand and took off in a mad dash back toward the bedroom. Even though she had clipped the corner as she rounded it, she didn't slow down, even with the knowledge that it was going to be one nasty bruise.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time Rio got to the doorway of the bedroom, though, she almost saw it before she heard it.
    </p>
<p>
     Flat on her back, hair strewn around here like wildfire and one hand pressed to her forehead, lay Agatha still naked. And she was... laughing?
    </p>
<p>
     She was
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's chest heaved both from the panic and the exertion of ripping across that houseboat to try and find out what the hell was going on. Agatha had not heard Rio's commotion through her own laughter, which still had not subsided.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was frozen in that doorway, absolutely no idea what was happening. That wasn't a 'ha-ha that's funny' laugh. It wasn't even a 'someone told me a good joke' laugh. There was sparks of electricity buzzing around that laugh, like it could be so very dangerous if it got any louder. Rio's eyes had not left Agatha, though. Her hand moved the longer the laugh went on, sliding down her cheek to eventually cover her mouth to try and stifle it.
    </p>
<p>
     Just before it got to the point where Rio started to grow concerned, Agatha finally calmed herself, though she held her palm over her mouth for a moment longer before she seemed to find herself again. As she began to speak, she had not realized that Rio had returned.
    </p>
<p>
     "I swear on all that is holy, Dave, you better not be fucking with me. I'm looking it up myself, so I'm putting you on speaker." Agatha did as she had said she was going to, lowering the phone as she switched it over to speakerphone and began to Google something.
    </p>
<p>
     "It hasn't been reported yet, Agatha. Not that it should be, anyway. Her only tie to any semblance of fame was you and we all know how fantastic that was." Dave's voice was nothing like what Rio had thought it might sound like when Agatha talked about it. "I only found out because the lawyer called me when he got an email that the suit was dropped."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's brow pinched; she was seeing each individual piece, but she was not able to make sense of them. That laugh did not match what Dave was saying.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's face screwed up in frustration, realizing that Dave had been right and nothing had been reported.
    </p>
<p>
     What was it that she was looking for?
    </p>
<p>
     "The moment there's anything in print, you need to send it to me. I'm not kidding, Dave. Call Brielle if you have to. I know you hate stooping as low as to poke the bear of TMZ but she never lets us down if we point her in the right direction." Agatha breathed a heavy sigh through her nose, though there was this brief giggle that sounded giddy.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, so one more time. And I swear Dave..."
    </p>
<p>
     "According to the email from the lawyer, the plaintiff was no longer alive to pursue the suit."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio completely forgot about any attempt she had been making to be nothing more than an observer.
    </p>
<p>
     "What?!"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sat bolt upright and as she did so, Rio could see her expression full-on, and with crystal clarity.
    </p>
<p>
     There were flashes of light dancing in her eyes which were glassy, threatening to spill. Despite the tears, Agatha looked over the fucking moon.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is that Rio?" came Dave's voice over the line.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped into the room, tucking a leg beneath herself as she slid on the bed, facing Agatha but putting them in a position where her knee was at Agatha's hip, leaving Agatha's knee at her own hip.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi, Dave," Rio greeted sweetly. She had not had the chance to make his acquaintance yet, but Agatha had a very deep well of respect for the man and his ability to keep her focused.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hello to you as well." He cleared his throat, as if it were an invisible way to segue the conversation. "So, I reached out to a couple of contacts out that way and her personals were across the street from the scene, including her wallet. Her identification was inside. They have to do an autopsy, but... when a lifted pick-up plows you over at ten at night doing twenty over the speed limit..."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's jaw had nearly come unhinged. The name hadn't been stated, but with the pure glee radiating out of every bit of Agatha's bare skin, Rio didn't really feel like she needed to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     "If for whatever reason this ends up not being true, David, I reserve the right to choke you nearly within an inch of your life."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," he scolded, clicking his tongue at her. "It's two in the afternoon. I have spent all morning vetting this."
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes lifted to Rio's for the first time since she'd placed herself next to her, that grin nearly splitting her face in two.
    </p>
<p>
     "Say it again, Dave. The first thing you said to me when I picked up the phone."
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio," he addressed, knowing exactly why Agatha was asking him to repeat it. "Evanora is dead."
    </p>
<p>
     There was something about just having an idea and then actually hearing it. Actually hearing it somehow made it feel less real than the idea she had been piecing together in her mind. It was ridiculous, something that seemed like some weird plot twist that no one had been expecting. Rio blinked it into her brain, trying to sink it further and further to somehow make it register.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's face never shifted, though, that bright and beaming smile lighting up every inch of her expression.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had opened her mouth to say something, but she drew in her breath and an acrid smell filling her nostrils -- fuck!
    </p>
<p>
     "I was making breakfast!" she nearly shouted as she flew to her feet and dashed back toward the kitchen. At the sight of the charred sausages and completely inedible eggs, she couldn't even find it in her to be upset about it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew what this meant. Rio knew that if anyone else would have witnessed Agatha having this kind of reaction to finding out her mother had been killed after being hit by a car? It seemed ridiculous. She had literally
     <i>
      just
     </i>
     put this to bed not 48 hours ago. Agatha had taken her power back and she was still donning it like armor.
    </p>
<p>
     This, though, was literal insanity.
    </p>
<p>
     This was the universe sticking its hand in the matters of humankind.
    </p>
<p>
     Evanora had made it her mission to ensure that Agatha's life was nothing short of hell if she had anything to say about it. She had been the sole reason that Agatha had ever gotten on that plane in the first place, the
     <i>
      only
     </i>
     reason Agatha had left her family behind to put down her past.
    </p>
<p>
     This turn of events didn't even feel real, but hearing Dave state it with such conviction made it hard not to believe him.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned off the burner and pushed the hot pans toward the back of the stovetop; they'd just have to order something instead. Or, maybe this was a call for celebration, depending on how this landed with Agatha over the next twenty minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she was sure nothing was going to catch fire, Rio made her way back -- slower this time -- to the bedroom to find Agatha propped up against the headboard, Rio's jersey on her torso, though her legs were still bare. She had been absorbed in her phone screen, but she noticed immediately this time as Rio entered the room again.
    </p>
<p>
     As she lifted her head, those beautiful blue eyes were still shining with her emotion, though Rio was waiting with baited breath for the other shoe to drop. The smile she was still wearing did not dim in the least.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha..." Rio ventured, not wanting to prod too hard but also wanting to make sure that she was alright. This was big. This was something that Rio was sure brought on a flurry of mixed emotions.
    </p>
<p>
     She slid onto the bed once more, placing herself next to Agatha, though she refrained from initiating contact simply for the fact that she was trying to gauge what type would be best to field how Agatha was feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     Their eyes locked and for a moment, Rio was almost convinced that this was going to devolve into a conversation about every reason Agatha was glad about the situation.
    </p>
<p>
     Those eyes started to shine a little more, despite the other woman's best efforts. Agatha's throat bobbed as her lips parted and she tried to find words, words that wouldn't come.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, the shine turned to glass. The glass turned into a tidal wave. The tears began to slip down Agatha's face, but she was quick in her movement to make sure that they were the only ones to fall as she wiped them off her own cheeks. It was enough of a show that it helped determine what Rio's next move was.
    </p>
<p>
     Lifting her arm, Rio dropped it around Agatha's shoulder and pulled her toward her chest. Agatha nearly folded right into her, placing her head against the front of Rio's shoulder as she let her eyes fall shut. The tears seemed to have been stifled, but she could still feel the tension in Agatha's form.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's... It makes me a bad person to be relieved, doesn't it?"
     </i>
     Agatha whispered into the fabric of Rio's t-shirt.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "No, baby, it doesn't. The last few days aside, you never deserved what she did to you. A mother is supposed to love unconditionally. You never got to know what that was like, so it's... It only stands to reason that your life now suddenly feels easier at the idea she's no longer around to interfere."
     </i>
     One of Rio's hands had moved to smooth over Agatha's hair, trying to help in whatever way she could.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Plus,"
     </i>
     Rio added,
     <i>
      "the fact that you even question if you're a bad person is enough proof that you aren't."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     After only a beat, Agatha began to move, lifting her head so that she could meet Rio's gaze.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "How do you always know the right things to say?"
     </i>
     Agatha asked her, the expression on her face reading as something that could have been called mystified.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Because I know you, my love. I know your heart. I know what you are willing to do to protect the people you love, and you don't even care if that means standing your ground. A bad person would not have had any issue picking up and leaving. A bad person would have done it themselves, taken them out, when in the same country as their aggressor."
     </i>
     Rio raised a hand, her fingertips tracing along the curve of Agatha's jaw.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're a good person because you handled your shit and the universe decided to hand you what you could never do yourself."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's head turned and she placed her lips to the center of Rio's palm in a soft kiss of affection. She left them there for a moment before she turned back, her eyes flickering up to find Rio's once again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you... God, I feel like a fucking asshole." Agatha exhaled a sigh, though she didn't look away. "I'd really like to go to lunch and get a bottle of champagne, if you wouldn't mind."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was not as shocked by this admission as she had briefly considered she might have been. Agatha was
     <i>
      really truly free.
     </i>
     There were no more surprises, no more wicked turns their paths might take that would have anything to do with Evanora fucking Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward, pressing their lips together in a full but warm kiss, pulling away to simply behold Agatha for a moment before she formed her answer.
    </p>
<p>
     "I would love to go out to lunch with you and share a bottle of champagne where we can toast to a lifetime of doing whatever the fuck we want without ever worrying about your past coming back to bite us," Rio offered back, as if she were trying to entice Agatha into agreeing to her own idea.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, when Agatha's eyes sparkled at her, it was out of nothing but pure affection.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, Rio," she cooed and Rio's lips simply curled up in response.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you too, Agatha. Let's shower and get dressed. We can go to Soul Bar and maybe indulge in two bottles of champagne if we decide to take an Uber," Rio attempted to goad, as if she really needed to work any harder to convince Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Something flashed in Agatha's eyes, much like a lightbulb springing to life, an illumination of a forgotten thought.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe we should go to the dealership first," she offered and for a moment, Rio was confused, but then it hit her too. "I owe Tay a new car."
    </p>
<p>
     They had both puddled into laughter and took only a moment to recover so that they could set about their day.
    </p>
<p>
     They had done as they had set out to do, settling on something a little similar to what Tay had before, but was definitely a bit of an upgrade with more bells and whistles than she would probably ever need. With it being the main vehicle that could accommodate the five of them, it was as much for everyone else as it was to replace what they'd sort of ruined in the heat of their reunion.
    </p>
<p>
     They had turned up at the house to find Estee's car gone and tucked the new SUV into the garage. As they waited out front for the Uber that would take them to the meal that had now evolved for dinner, Rio had decided to text Estee to let her know that they were alive, at the very least.
    </p>
<p>
     They had a short back and forth that had closed out with Rio assuring that the two of them would be returning to the house that night so they could all be back together again. She had learned in the conversation that the three of them had been at the market, picking up things to fill the fridge with, which worked out in everyone's favor.
    </p>
<p>
     Their celebration dinner had felt just as good to experience as it had to even entertain the idea.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could see it, sitting across that table from her true love, that she was finally liberated. She had finally reached a point of enlightenment in her life where she knew she had to worry about one less person that might ever try to hurt her. Selfishly, Rio was glad. Rio was happy that this was not going to be something that was hanging over their heads for years to come.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course she was not so insensitive to announce it aloud; no matter how glib Agatha was acting about this, there were still surely feelings to be had in this regard. This was a lifetime of conflicted emotions, things that she had surely tried to repress in every way she could. Maybe the breakdown would come that night in bed, or maybe it would come a week from that moment, in the middle of the market with a carton of eggs in her hand. Maybe it would be a year down the road, or... It very well could be possible that it just might never come.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did not understand the depths of Agatha's trauma with her mother, and she would never pretend to. What she could do, though, was tread water right beside Agatha, ready at any given moment to jump into action to keep her afloat.
    </p>
<p>
     They had not quite finished the second bottle of bubbly by the time they decided to pay the bill and make their way back to the house to meet the kids.
    </p>
<p>
     While they were not
     <i>
      drunk,
     </i>
     Rio and Agatha were just intoxicated enough that sustaining any kind of physical contact had been a necessity. Rio's hand had landed on Agatha's thigh and Agatha had responded by playing with her fingers. Agatha's head had fallen to Rio's shoulder and in turn, Rio had placed her lips to Agatha's hairline. It was this quiet give and take, this balance of just how symbiotic they truly were.
    </p>
<p>
     They got out of the back of the car on relatively steady feet as they made their way through the front gate and up the walk, giggling at the idea of what was about to unfold when they walked into that house.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio unlocked the door to let them in and they could immediately hear the sounds of...
    </p>
<p>
     Those, Rio realized, were the sounds of being
     <i>
      home.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The kids were laughing, shouting things that sounded like trivia answers while soft music droned on in the background. As they came around the corner, hand-in-hand, all three of them were absorbed in the trivia game playing on the screen in front of them. Rio and Agatha stood, side by side and just... reveled in it.
    </p>
<p>
     Their three children.
    </p>
<p>
     Siblings.
    </p>
<p>
     Family.
    </p>
<p>
     When the round was over, Nicky had announced he was grabbing a drink and asked the girls if they wanted anything but as he got up and turned around, the sight of Rio and his mother startled him.
    </p>
<p>
     "Christ! When did you two get in?!" he asked, pressing a hand to his chest as he tried to catch his breath from the way it had left him in his fright.
    </p>
<p>
     The girls' heads both whipped around, mirrored grins appearing on beautiful faces.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mamas!" the girls chirped in unison and even though it was so casual, Rio caught Estee's eye and shot her a knowing look that practically screamed she was fighting for air at their little trick.
    </p>
<p>
     "Heads up, Tay," Agatha acknowledged, tossing the keys over the space between them, landing snugly in Tay's palms. As she looked down at them, her brow pinched in confusion, her blonde curls falling forward as she studied it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Erm..." Tay voiced, almost as if she were afraid to point out the obvious. "These aren't my keys..."
    </p>
<p>
     She lifted her head and looked over at the two matriarchs, the confusion completely scribbled across her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes they are. The car's in the garage." Agatha's answer was pointed, but it wasn't cold. She was just trying to head off the conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     "The one in the garage?" Tay repeated, having already spotted it when they had brought the groceries inside. "That's not my --"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did not miss the way Estee's grip sunk into Tay's arm, as if willing her to absolutely not press this conversation any further. Tay's head snapped toward her girlfriend, but Estee's face was soft in its pleading, but Tay was not getting it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Please babe, just take the keys and say thank you," Estee nearly begged her.
    </p>
<p>
     All at once, Tay's posture stiffened slightly as the realization hit her. Her lips pressed together and even though she couldn't see Tay's face, she could see enough of Estee's to tell that they were torn on wanting to call them absolute heathens and embracing the perk of a brand new vehicle to drive.
    </p>
<p>
     Tay's head turned back, though her smile was not pained or awkward.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, Agatha," Tay offered, trying to hide her mixed emotions over the gift, but ultimately she truly was thankful.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's good to have you home, Agatha," Estee told her, tilting her head at her sweetly.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's good to be home. I missed all of you," Agatha stated, but before she could think to say anything else, Nicky was on his way over, walking right into his mother's arms. Rio felt warm from head to toe as she watched the exchange; it was so vastly different from the first time she had witnessed a sight so similar.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha let him go, though, both of her hands landed on his cheeks, her eyes searching his face as she debated how best to deliver the news she had to serve.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched with vested interest as Agatha looked from Nicky to the girls, her gaze finally casting next to her, landing on Rio. The way Agatha was looking at her, she was looking for that little push, that touch of encouragement that said this was the right thing to do.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave the gentlest nod, tipping forward in a silent push.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes landed back on her son as her lips pressed together.
    </p>
<p>
     "Evanora was hit by a car last night," Agatha admitted out loud, and Nicky's eyes widened immediately, huge at the realization. "She's dead."
    </p>
<p>
     The silence in that room was the loudest thing Rio had ever heard, and it lay there for a long several moments before Estee was the one who decided to break it.
    </p>
<p>
     "What... What does that mean?" she posed, her voice unusually small, though her eyes hadn't left Agatha's face.
    </p>
<p>
     Meeting her gaze, Agatha's lips curled in the softest smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "It means that if I ever have to leave again, the option for one or all of you to follow me doesn't have to be tabled for your safety."
    </p>
<p>
     It happened so fast: Estee's jaw bulged and her throat quivered as she fought back the urge to cry. She succeeded pretty quickly, but Rio knew.
    </p>
<p>
     "It means that my lifetime nightmare will never inflict pain on this family ever again. That's my promise to all four of you," Agatha voiced as she stepped back, looping an arm over Rio's shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     "And..." Agatha added, a bright twinkle in her eyes. "That means we have a wedding to start planning!"
    </p>

<p>
     There was something about the way the evening settled around them as the children tucked into their own spots on that massive sectional that filled the majority of the living room that solidified of piece of Rio's heart in her chest, an acceptance of the fact that this was actually a life she had attained.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had fetched everyone snacks and beverages and the girls had situated themselves on either wise of the women, Tay sidled up next to Agatha and Estee curled right into her mother's side. Nicky, once he had finished the task her set out to accomplish had placed himself on the ottoman in front of the four women, leaning forward on his thighs as he cracked open his soda.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had pulled out her phone and was flipping through pictures, settling on one that she had previously mentioned in conversation with Rio. She held it up, showing the photo that was on display; It was Agatha who was holding the phone, but her arm was around a younger man who was quite handsome with that rugged jaw that was covered in stubble and piercing blue eyes that were several shades closer to white than Agatha's. His arm was around a smaller woman that fit perfectly into his side.
    </p>
<p>
     "That is Jack," Agatha indicated, mostly to Rio so that she was able to put a face to the name she had heard many times. "And that --" She had started to indicate the woman under his arm, but Estee was quick to cut her off.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is that
     <i>
      Thea Landon?
     </i>
     From the show Eleven Hours?!" At this, Tay seemed to crane in to get a better view of the photo.
    </p>
<p>
     "It is," Agatha confirmed, and without even looking over at her, Rio knew that she was grinning ear to her.
    </p>
<p>
     "How?!" Estee asked, her bright eyes sweeping up to Agatha in amazement.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead of answering her, Agatha reached up with a finger and swiped to the next picture. In a word? That photo was pure chaos. There were a good almost twenty other people in it. At the back stood Agatha under the arm of a taller, older man. He had grey hair and the same colored stubble, but he looked like an absolute rockstar. On her other side, a slightly smaller woman was hugging Agatha's side beneath her arm.
    </p>
<p>
     Around them were about eight faces that shared similarities to the adults on either side of Agatha to confirm that they were likely their children. Rio recognized them only through the story Agatha had told her about going over there, about spending time with them.
    </p>
<p>
     The girls had no such knowledge, and this was evident by the way they both devolved into bewildered shrieks of surprise.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know the Landons?!" Estee squealed, nearly leaning completely over Rio to try and get a better view.
    </p>
<p>
     "No way, how?!" Tay voiced, repeating Estee's earlier question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Jack and I have been friends for a couple of years, now, simply by brushing elbows. But Walker and I? We go way back. He's been a song writer on a great deal of my original soundtracks. He's... an amazing musician. And he's a pretty great dad, too."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, doesn't he have like ten kids or something wild like that?" Estee posed, her eyes transfixed on Agatha's face as she asked, as if she already couldn't wait to have the answer.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nine, but he also adopted and raised his younger brother," she informed them, exhaling a gentle laugh. "The youngest five are all quintuplets. Thea, Jack's girlfriend, is the youngest of the lot."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, but she's also definitely the meanest," Nicky shot with a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, she's just mean to you because you're more annoying than her own brothers," Agatha shot back pointedly, though the immediate grin she was wearing was a clear indicator of her teasing.
    </p>
<p>
     "Aren't all of their kids stupid famous?" Tay asked, her eyes ust as fixed on Agatha, enchanted by this side of her life that they had not been privy to up until that point.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been of the understanding that Agatha had likely rubbed shoulders with powerful people and important names, but to Rio? Estee did not try to mince words when calling her out for the amount of media she had consumed in her life that was not filmed out in the wild. It could have been said that perhaps she was a little uncultured, which would explain why she was not completely losing her mind with them.
    </p>
<p>
     "The oldest is a musician," Nicky had started, but Agatha was quick with a follow up.
    </p>
<p>
     "Who I also love to tap into when it comes to creative artistry. When I need something heavier, Walker's always my first call, but Liz is... She's incredible at what she does," she explained.
    </p>
<p>
     "Right, we've been listening to her since we were in high school," Estee gushed.
    </p>
<p>
     At this, realization snapped itself quickly over Rio's face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Wait, is that the one that I had to buy you the same CD three different times because you guys kept taking it back and forth between houses and scratching the mickey out of it?" Rio posed, and the girls burst into laughter at the memory.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yep," Tay confirmed, "That's the one."
    </p>
<p>
     "
     <i>
      Oh,
     </i>
     well shit."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's own mega-watt grin softened only out of tenderness as she turned her head to place a soft kiss to the side of Rio's head before she turned her attention back to her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's one of the older twin boys. His name is Rhys and he is a photographer for Vogue. He used to work for Alternative Press, but he climbed the ladder," her fingertip landed just below his chin to indicate who she was speaking about. "He has an identical twin that plays for the Indianapolis Colts."
    </p>
<p>
     "This is... unreal," Estee managed, something just louder than a breath. "Like, we obviously knew that you were famous... but holy shit."
    </p>
<p>
     "The next oldest is Dalia," she indicated, zooming in on two women; the one with the lighter hair looked incredibly similar to the matriarch of the clan and the other, taller girl was nearly holding onto her for dear life. "That's her wife, Cole, with her. Dalia does a lot of charity work with a lot of the local LGBT shelters and Cole is one of the most esteemed trauma therapists in the state."
    </p>
<p>
     There was an affection on Agatha's face as she looked down at the two women and Rio gave her a gentle nudge in the ribs, as if to ask:
     <i>
      penny for your thoughts?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced at her, then back to the photo.
    </p>
<p>
     "Their story, when they told it at their wedding... God, it was so beautiful. Literally something I would salivate at the idea of adapting, but also something I would never touch out of respect for who they are and what they came from." Agatha stilled for a moment, her eyes casting down to Rio for just a moment; this was going to hurt to hear as much as it was going to hurt to recount it, if for no other reason than the fact that they were mothers and they understood.
    </p>
<p>
     "Cole came from a very broken foster system, and she was a fighter. The day they met, it was because Cole chased some boys off of harassing Dalia. One night, the Landons were coming home from a birthday dinner and Dalia spotted her outside of a club." Agatha took a breath, that warm smile still on her face. "She talked Walker into picking her up and he ended up letting her stay the night. They... they went through a lot of really heavy shit for teenagers, but Cole will look you in the face and not blink when she tells you that becoming a Landon is one of the biggest accomplishments of her life."
    </p>
<p>
     "That's actually fucking adorable?" came Tay's voice, a little laden with emotion.
    </p>
<p>
     "What makes it hilarious," Nicky chimed in, "is that when you meet them separately, you would never guess that they're together, let alone married. Cole tries to make herself seem so tough and hard toward anyone she doesn't know that isn't a patient, and then D is literally sunshine in human form. It's pretty hilarious."
    </p>
<p>
     "So, wait," Estee interjected, finally catching on. "You
     <i>
      hang out with them?
     </i>
     " Her eyes widened slightly, but then narrowed. "And you never thought to tell us?! Nick! You suck!"
    </p>
<p>
     The moment she hurled the last playful jab, she also pulled the pillow from behind her and threw that at him, too.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean, when I'm in town, I like hanging out with Wyatt and Dustin! But ever since Dustin started dating the girl that is Cinderella at Disneyland..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Wait..." Rio cut in this time, her brow pinching slightly. "I thought I was doing a pretty good job of keeping up, but
     <i>
      what?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha locked her phone and leaned back, wrapping an arm around Rio's shoulders to pull her in a little closer.
    </p>
<p>
     "When you have nine kids dating and or married to nine different people, stories get pretty wild," Agatha offered, her light laugh so sweet and affectionate as it hit the air around them. "Trust me, Walker and I have a standing deal that should they ever decide to go the biography route, I'm the first call he will make."
    </p>
<p>
     "Hm," Rio mused, sneaking a glance up at Agatha from beneath her lashes, a small smirk curling her lips. "Sound like a standing deal that you might have with someone else attached to the Landons," she prodded, digging a gentle but teasing finger into Agatha's ribs.
    </p>
<p>
     "Wait!" Estee cried out, a hand flying out to land on her mother's forearm. Her head whipped around, eyes darting from Agatha to Rio and then back to Agatha again. "Does that mean... that you'd invite them to the wedding?!" Her eyes shifted down, looking across at Tay as if they were going to be floored if Agatha said yes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, however, took a beat of measured silence as she best figured out how to answer that.
    </p>
<p>
     It was not something the two of them, as a couple, had actually discussed yet. They had known there would be time to have those conversations, but Agatha had not been expecting it to come up so soon, she wasn't quite sure how to field the answer.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's something we're going to talk about..." Agatha had started, but Rio was quick to pick up where she had left it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Tonight," she added, her eyes finding Estee's with a soft smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's head dropped onto Rio's shoulder and she squeezed Rio's hand between both of her own, holding it tightly, a silent line of communication that she was
     <i>
      happy,
     </i>
     that she felt
     <i>
      safe,
     </i>
     and that things in their lives had finally turned out alright. It had been a long time coming for the two of them, and it had been one hell of a road to get there, but they had finally reached the precipice and all that laid before them was majestic and regal in sight.
    </p>
<p>
     With Agatha in their lives, everything had fallen into place.
    </p>
<p>
     With Agatha around, life just seemed to make sense.
    </p>
<p>
     The five of them had sat, milling about in idle conversation as the night seemed to wind down around them. The sun had disappeared from the sky and there was nothing but milky twilight visible out the floor-to-ceiling windows. It was the closing of another day in which they were all going to fall asleep under the same room.
    </p>
<p>
     "Wait!" Rio pressed suddenly, her eyes a little wide. "You know what I just realized?!"
    </p>
<p>
     Three pairs of eyes fell on her in question, but Agatha's grip around her shoulders tightened as Rio felt her lips press to the side of her head. It was almost as if she knew what Rio was going to say.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's our first night here... all together..."
     </i>
     Rio remarked, the amazement of the realization so warm over her words.
    </p>
<p>
     "While we did leave a couple of boxes that not a one of us had any desire to open," Estee divulged, "we did get most of the clothes put away, as well as the bed made so that you wouldn't have to worry about it when you got back."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's middle warmed and she leaned just barely out of Agatha's weight so that she could kiss her daughter on the forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     "You three..." Rio began, wonder in her voice. "You are all just something else."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky's eyes found Rio's across the space between them and those lips hitched up in an earnest smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "We just know that when we're all together, it's the best it can be. We know that... it's been a lot and so if we could see to it that, after making everything happen for each of us like this, you could come home and just... be? Well, we didn't mind."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had watched him, rapt for a moment as she listened to him speak, really heard what he was saying.
    </p>
<p>
     That was the thing with Nicky; the words he chose were important yes, but the conversation he had with his eyes? The way he said so much while still physically saying comparatively much less? His words themselves were heavy with his intent, but that look in his eyes as he didn't budge from Rio's gaze moved something in her.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio had not clocked was how Estee was watching the man across from them, nearly holding her breath. It was like there was something unspoken between them, like she was waiting for what might come next.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know this might seem out of place, or like maybe it isn't the right time..." he began, and while his lids fluttered and Rio thought he might look away, he did not. Instead, he kept going. "But... this... this is what I dreamed of as a kid. This was what I wanted. And I got it because my mom fell in love with you. I..." his lips twisted a moment, but his face smoothed, even softening before he found his voice again. "I would be remiss if I didn't take a moment to tell you that I love you too, mama."
    </p>
<p>
     If there had been absolutely any hope of Rio holding back her tears? It had completely sailed out the window with his delivered sentiment and that soft inflection over the term she was so used to hearing from her own girls. The tears welled, hot and emotional, before they slipped down Rio's cheeks. While she was stunned to stillness for a moment, she finally found her cognizance and lunged forward, getting to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky read the reaction in the blink of an eye and got to his feet, too, already braced for the way Rio nearly launched herself into an embrace around his middle, her cheek pressed to his chest as the tears still streamed down it.
    </p>
<p>
     Behind her on the couch, Agatha was struggling to choke down her own tears that were threatening to devastate her in the sweetest way.
    </p>
<p>
     They had come a long way from him looking her in the eye and telling her he would never respect Rio as any kind of a parent, and he had just addressed her as such of his own voalition.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could win that battle, though, the grip on her left tightened and just as quickly, Estee filled the space where Rio had been, immediately dropping her head to land on Agatha's shoulder. "And we love you too, mum," Estee murmured at her, eliciting another tightening of Tay's old on Agatha's arm.
    </p>
<p>
     In the same breath, the same exact moment, two voices sounded from feet apart with different intended targets.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Te amo, mijo,"
     </i>
     Rio murmured softly.
    </p>
<p>
     And at the exact same moment:
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, girls."
    </p>
<p>
     It was the softest symphony of a promise, a guarantee that what they had was unbreakable. While Tay was the exception, both of their biological children had spent half or all of their lives with one parent, one support system to keep them propped up and on the right path in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     In what had apparently been a conversation between them, they had come to the conclusion that with things headed where they were, and a wedding on the horizon, it was okay to accept the inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
     Did Rio think he might use that term every time he addressed her from there on out? Of course not, but the fact that he had taken it upon himself to show the initiative truly touched her.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been a smooth transition as they all untangled and Rio and Agatha announced that they were going to turn in for the night. The embraces had been exchanged, heads had been kissed once a piece and the children had declared they were going to watch a movie before they themselves decided to turn in.
    </p>
<p>
     They bid the three of them a good night and headed up the stairs, still a little buzzed, hand in hand to head to their new safe haven.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha flipped on the light, Rio's eyes swept around the room, taking in the sight of it. The bed was put together and made, the dressers adorned with photographs that the kids had placed in frames. There were three in total; one was of the five of them, and the other two were photos of Rio and Agatha that Rio immediately realized neither of them had been aware of.
    </p>
<p>
     In each of them, though, despite the setting around them?
    </p>
<p>
     The only sun they cared to stare into was the soul of the other.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio scooped one up to look down at it, she felt Agatha's arms around her middle as she tucked her chin over Rio's shoulder to peer down at what was in her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's definitely a Nicky shot. Must have been when we went to the island," she commented in a gentle murmur, though she only punctuated her statement by tucking her face into Rio's neck, placing a soft kiss there. Rio slowly set the frame back down and reached up behind her to cradle the back of Agatha's head in her palm.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio shifted, turning around in her grasp. She raised a finger, tracing it down the slope of Agatha's nose, just a gentle show of affection and appreciation.
    </p>
<p>
     In classic Agatha fashion, as Rio's touch dropped to pass Agatha's lips, she moved quickly enough to catch Rio's finger between the teeth, though the hold was only momentary. She released, a grin pulling at her lips as she tilted her head at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're positively rotten, sometimes," Rio cooed at her, though she leaned toward her to give a soft kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     "But you love me," Agatha posed back, the playful challenge audible in her tone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Without question."
    </p>
<p>
     They shared in another kiss and then took a moment to just... take in their room. There were pieces of art propped up against the walls that Rio was sure Agatha had ordered and other little knick-knacks were placed in the exact spots Rio would have wanted them in. It was clear that the kids had taken their time, had wanted to make sure that they could help in whatever way the could.
    </p>
<p>
     The care that they had taken to make this into another home for their mothers was moving in a way Rio almost felt undeserving of.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd ended up in the closet, which was almost large enough to be another bedroom entirely, and Rio truly was struck with just how amazed she was by how absolutely
     <i>
      perfect
     </i>
     this place was for them. Agatha had clearly put a lot of time and attention into making this happen, and she had done an amazing job.
    </p>
<p>
     After changing into sleepwear -- t-shirts and panties -- they had slid into their respective spots that they filled whenever they got in any bed together. It was routine, it was habit. It was their normal.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio was normally the one who seemed so easily to fall into Agatha, it was Agatha's turn this time to melt into her fiancée, causing Rio's arm to move only to secure Agatha against her side. As her head tilted back against the headboard, her eyes slid shut and she just let it all fall around them.
    </p>
<p>
     She was stuck again, in that frame of mind where she was still finding it so hard to believe that this was what her life had become. There had been so many nights when she would stir from a dream in a cold sweat, confused as to why there wasn't someone next to her. They had been more frequent when she had been younger, but they had never truly stopped the older she got.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, the only days since they'd been reunited that they'd been apart had been the three days it had taken Agatha to go to LA and come back. Now, when she woke up from those dreams? The dreams had become about Agatha, and Agatha was there when she opened her eyes. Even more than that, she was steadily against Rio's side, or only inches away.
    </p>
<p>
     Gone were the days when Rio had to find comfort and solace in being alone.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, as she lowered her chin, she had the woman she loved asking her a very loaded, but very sentimental question.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Where do
      <b>
       you
      </b>
      want to get married?"
     </i>
     Agatha posed, her soft tones barely above a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's fingers absentmindedly began to trace light shapes on Agatha's upper arm as she began to think. That was... a pretty big question. If asked, Rio would have said they could have gotten married on that bridge for all she cared, just the five of them and someone to officiate, and she would have been fine with that. She sensed that Agatha was asking for a reason, though.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's really... Saying it doesn't matter doesn't feel right,"
     </i>
     Rio explained, turning to nuzzle into Agatha's hair as she continued.
     <i>
      "But... if you're asking me if I'd rather here or LA... I don't think that I would have a preference. Yes, this has been home, but that will be home, too, you know?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could feel Agatha's cheek pull up in a smile against her chest.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "There's a place... it's in the mountains. A couple of years ago the fires did a lot of damage, but the blooms came back for the first time this year."
     </i>
     There was this cute little hike in her voice, like there was more to it than she was able to explain in this conversation.
     <i>
      "So, depending on how long we wanted to wait... they'll be at peak in April."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's smile was instant and she breathed the softest chuckle into  Agatha's hair.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You want to get married in six months?"
     </i>
     Rio cooed at her, the whispered words still holding a sing-song cadence to them.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'd marry you tomorrow if I thought it practical,"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured back at her, exhaling a soft sigh.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And would this be a very large and very grand wedding per the nature of your status?"
     </i>
     Rio teased, her lips brushing barely against Agatha's scalp as she spoke, though it seemed to elicit a shiver.
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha pulled back to look at her, studying her for a long moment before she formed her answer.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "At max, I'd like fifty people. I don't know if we'd hit that number, but if we invite every Landon and their partners, we'd already be pushing over twenty. And of course Tay's parents are more than welcome and..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "We don't,"
     </i>
     Rio answered before Agatha could ask if they had anyone else they would want to be included.
    </p>
<p>
     While Agatha's lips turned down at the corners for a brief moment, she understood it. She always had.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "But it's okay, because we have the only people we have ever needed right here with us,"
     </i>
     Rio informed her, raising a hand to curl her finger beneath the corner of Agatha's jaw. She held her there for just a moment before she leaned toward her, placing their lips together lightly in a neat kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha peered into her, trying to read her, just trying to listen. Judging by the look on her face, she wasn't fairing well and so she decided to speak the question aloud.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What do you want in all of this?"
     </i>
     she posed, and while Rio understood the context in which she was asking, that was not the vein in which she chose to answer.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I want to walk down an aisle where you're at the end waiting for me. I want to hold your hands as I look you in the eye and promise to tie my life to yours for as long as I continue to breathe. I want to put a gorgeous ring on your finger, kiss you, and call you my wife."
     </i>
     Rio paused, taking in the look on Agatha's face which registered somewhere between rapt and taken.
     <i>
      "Everything else? Those are just semantics."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression was so soft, so vulnerable, and it almost seemed like she might have hit an emotional epiphany, but she took a slow breath and closed the gap between them again, their lips crushing with a tender gentleness that was only slightly familiar to them. The longer they kissed the more Rio began to taste salt on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Another moment passed before she pulled back, her eyes opening to take in the sight of Agatha who had glistening streams down her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hey, hey,"
     </i>
     Rio soothed, affectionately brushing her thumb over Agatha's lips.
     <i>
      "It's okay, what's wrong?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes opened into her own, but they were not upset or worried. Those eyes were not panicked or scared. Those eyes were full of deep emotion and a lack of a way to try and communicate it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm just so lucky,"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured at her, so close that Rio could taste the remnants of the champagne on her breath.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yeah?"
     </i>
     Rio whispered back.
     <i>
      "Why's that?"
     </i>
     She tipped her head just enough to steal another soft kiss before she allowed Agatha to continue.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Because of all the people in this entire world, you chose me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's own eyes threatened to spill, but she somehow managed to blink the flood back, settling herself.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh, Agatha. I'd choose you every single time. Every. Time."
     </i>

     As the weeks started to come and go in a faster fashion than they ever had, the more their little family began to fall into a routine. Rio was able to devote more time to her drone project, which left a slightly directionless Agatha to try to busy herself. But, more often than not, she ended up in Rio's office on the couch with a book or a magazine, or sometimes she pretended to scroll through her phone, but Rio
     <i>
      always
     </i>
     caught her staring.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What is it this time?"
     </i>
     she would ask every time.
    </p>
<p>
     Every single time, Agatha had a different answer.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I was just looking at the poster on the wall."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "I can see the little wrinkles in your brow that look like the number eleven. I think you're working too hard."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh, nothing, just that if you bite your lip any harder, you're going to make it bleed."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "I was just thinking about cheese rolls. Should I go get some?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Usually, by the fourth or fifth question, Rio would cave and place herself in Agatha's lap to pay her a few minutes of the attention her restless brain seemed to be craving. They would kiss and giggle, they would whisper silly promises as they brushed the tips of their noses together.
    </p>
<p>
     Most mornings, Rio still had a thirty second adjustment period where she would open her eyes and struggle to place where she was, or what kind of life she was living. All it took was rolling over to see Agatha -- either on her side facing away or on her stomach with fingertips less than an inch from Rio's form -- and everything came falling back into place.
    </p>
<p>
     She was in bed next to her fiancée, in their massive house while their children slept in the other rooms. She was in a healthy and loving relationship with a woman who had been ripped straight out of a dream. They had three children that loved them both in equal measure. What more could Rio have possibly asked for when her life felt so perfect?
    </p>
<p>
     Estee and Tay's graduation had rapidly approached, and the five of them had boarded a flight to attend. Rio was certain that the image of their little troupe hustling through the airport had been one for the ages, but she couldn't have tamed just how
     <i>
      happy
     </i>
     that kind of chaos made her. It was brief flashes of her hand in Agatha's as she led the pack, chin high and hair blowing behind her from the force of her gait. Rio scrambling behind her trying to keep up. Nicky and Tay practically carrying Estee who was still a little slow-going despite the progress she had been making in regard to her leg. The group of them getting into their seats, only minorly bickering about who got aisle and who got window.
    </p>
<p>
     Watching Estee and Tay walk across that stage, accomplishing something they had worked years for? Rio had been convinced that she was going to be the only one looking like an emotional fool, the moment Agatha wrapped an arm around her and laid her head against Rio's, Rio had been able to feel the shake of her crying, too. When they looked at each other, Rio was moved by the sheer emotion in those beautiful blue eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm so proud of her."
     </i>
     Agatha's sincerity coated her words like thick honey, clingy and sweet.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Me too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Instead of flying back that night, they'd decided on a couple of hotel rooms at the Crowne Plaza -- three, actually, at Nicky's behest despite the fact that the girls said they could behave themselves -- and had swiped several bottles of champagne to celebrate. Rio and Agatha had offered to take them out, but instead they requested to order take-out from Flame. They had all convened in Rio and Agatha's room to share their meal and their champagne, and Agatha had pointed out that the food was very reminiscent of American BBQ, and even though she hadn't mocked Rio like she could have, it still earned her a bemused glare from bright green eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been something so serene about that evening, even as everyone tucked away to their own rooms, Rio and Agatha both pulling each of the girls into tight hugs to tell them how impossibly proud of them they were, and how their lives were just beginning.
    </p>
<p>
     Unsurprisingly, Nicky had taken the opportunity to be his usual smartass self.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Yeah, you guys did okay I guess,"
     </i>
     before that face-splitting grin cracked his face nearly in half and the girls each reached with one hand to give him a playful push.
    </p>
<p>
     It was moments like that, moments where the pieces of their lives had fallen into place and the whole masterpiece was visible, where Rio was left breathless. Sometimes, she often wondered if even the children had been siblings in a past life, because the bond they had managed to build with complete and utter ease? It was incredible. It was astounding.
    </p>
<p>
     As it turned out, the longer time wore on, the more of those she got. And Rio ate up every last one.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been six weeks since Agatha had returned home and their lives felt settled and yet, still somehow chaotic.
    </p>
<p>
     That morning in particular, Rio had woken up to an empty bed -- something that made her frown and grumble concurrently -- but it had only taken a moment for her senses to kick in. Judging by the smell wafting throughout the house, Agatha was cooking breakfast.
    </p>
<p>
     After her typical morning routine of stretching, brushing her hair and teeth and making sure she was appropriately dressed, Rio made her way downstairs to see Agatha in the kitchen, where she knew she would be. Although it had been a couple of weeks since she'd last seen the sight, Rio couldn't fight her grin at the sight of Agatha with her All Blacks kit on, her hair twisted up into a disastrous bun toward the top of her head. It was a casualty of war when one had that much hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Silently on soft footsteps, Rio carried herself toward the counter, noiselessly slipping onto the stool as she propped her chin on the palm of her hand, just... watching.
    </p>
<p>
     As she knew would come, Agatha started humming a tune -- one that Rio recognized as a love song she'd given Agatha shit for knowing -- as she tended to the work in front of her. Leaning just slightly to the side, Rio could see that she was making pancakes. As Agatha shifted to the right, Rio's eyes landed on the large pile of them that had accumulated up to that point in her progress.
    </p>
<p>
     It was funny, really. For years, breakfast was cereal or granola and a cup of coffee. Not since Agatha had been around. Even that first morning, Rio wouldn't have typically cooked a breakfast, but she'd wanted desperately to find a way to keep her around, even if it had failed.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, Agatha made her pancake batter from scratch, she picked up eggs from the farmer that lived ten minutes down the road, always trying to barter with him to get an extra bottle of milk by promising him she'd bake him whatever cake he wanted. It always worked.
    </p>
<p>
     The humming continued and Rio's smile only seemed to grow. This was what she had been missing out on her whole life. If twenty of years of isolation meant that she got it now, and every day for the rest of her life? She was more than okay with that. Ideally, they had the next five to six decades to sit beside one another and watch as the world moved around them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved the pan to the back burner almost at the same time her left hand flipped the last pancake onto the stack. She turned to head for the refrigerator, but out of the corner of her eye, she caught sight of Rio and nearly jumped out of her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     "Jesus fucking Christ, Rio!" she managed, her hand flying to her chest in some attempt to still her now wildly beating heart.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's giggles were instant, a feigned look of guilt writing itself across her face. "I'm sorry!" she pushed, though she didn't mean it even one bit.
    </p>
<p>
     "How long have you been sitting there?!" Agatha nearly shrieked, her eyes still wide though Rio could see in her face that she was simply more startled than she was upset.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe five minutes. Or however long it took you to cook the last two pancakes."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, her jaw set as if she were trying to keep up that air of irritation, but Rio knew her better than that. Before they could engage in any further back and forth, a duo of sing-song greetings met them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good morning!" came the sweet sounds of Tay and Estee's voices.
    </p>
<p>
     In the same vein, they were met with a harmony of "Good morning, girls," from both Rio and Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mmmm, smells good. Pancakes?" Estee asked as she and Tay both moved to take seats on the stools on either side of Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course. I also managed a small jar of Kōhia syrup from the farmer yesterday. He said it's
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     sweet, though, so to use it sparingly," Agatha advised as she began to move about, grabbing plates and silverware before she set them on the counter top. A moment later, the stack of pancakes was next to them and the syrup and butter sat next to them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Help yourselves," she offered. She turned toward the coffee pot and began fixing herself and Rio each a cup of coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     Black for Rio, as always, and cream for herself. Always.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha finished making her own plate, her eyes fell to the remaining plate, a wrinkle forming in her brow. Rio knew what she was going to ask before it left her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is Nicky still sleeping?" she asked, her brow pinching a bit more.
    </p>
<p>
     This, to Rio, was a perfectly normal question that should have had a perfectly normal answer. But as the girls failed to respond and Rio turned to look from one of them toward the other, the sheepish smiles that were almost echoes of each other formed on their faces.
    </p>
<p>
     "Erm, that's not an answer?" Agatha responded, her brow quirking in silent demand for compliance.
    </p>
<p>
     "You lot went out last night?" Rio posed, tearing off a piece of her pancake before popping it into her mouth, her eyes landing on Estee, head tipping in interrogation.
    </p>
<p>
     "We did."
    </p>
<p>
     "And... you two came home... and Nicky went where?" Rio pushed a little harder.
    </p>
<p>
     Tay cleared her throat, almost like she was trying to not let their grilling shake Estee's loyalty. The hotter Rio's gaze grew, though, the quicker she started to melt beneath it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay! We've been going to The Mothership for the last few weeks... And two weeks ago, he met someone."
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Rio's jaw dropped, Agatha's eyebrows shot up, creasing her forehead in multiple spots. The shock between the both of them was completely palpable in the air around them. Rio sensed there was more, though, so she eased back on her stool, but her unwavering gaze encouraged her daughter to keep going.
    </p>
<p>
     "His name is Hēmi. He's Māori and he is very handsome," Estee admitted, and although Tay almost immediately started speaking, Rio's gaze had already cut back to Agatha who was wearing an expression that was a perfect mixture of shocked and proud.
    </p>
<p>
     "And he's
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     funny," Tay added. "Nicky said he thought he could be home in time for breakfast, but clearly he did not manage to make that happen."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes dropped to her plate as she tore a piece of pancake off and tossed it into her mouth, chewing thoughtfully for a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was watching her like a hawk, studying her every movement, trying to discern what was going on up there in that head of hers. She didn't look angry, or upset. In fact... she looked... happy. Her gaze shifted to Agatha's hand as she grabbed her mug and took a long pull of her coffee, despite how hot it was.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know what?" she said as she lowered the mug to the counter. "Good for him."
    </p>
<p>
     In the exact same second, four grins spread across the room like a brush fire.
    </p>
<p>
     "He was going to tell you," Estee told Agatha, the honesty clearly written on her face. "He just wanted to make sure it was something worth telling first."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha softened and Rio understood it immediately. He had spent a large part of his youth watching her parade women in and out of their home, never making an appearance twice. To him, it had seemed like she was shoving it in his face, but she'd been so deep in her own need to fix herself that she hadn't taken him into consideration. For him to state so plainly that he didn't want to do that to her, or even the two of them, it was a shining example of how his character had evolved through dealing with his trauma.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took another sip of her coffee, something Rio realized immediately was both a stalling tactic and a way for her to literally swallow down her emotions. She knew that Agatha was undoubtedly happy for him, but that little piece of information had settled a little uncomfortably within her. Still, as she lowered the mug, that stunning smile returned to her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm really happy for him. And I hope he brings Hēmi over some time. We would love to meet him." Her answers were a little political, but Rio knew that she was still processing. Agatha's eyes flickered with a little bit of light as she looked between the two girls a couple of moments before she posed her next question. "Is he very handsome, or is he
     <i>
      very
     </i>
     handsome?"
    </p>
<p>
     The girls burst into laughter, Estee even dropping her fork.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love that the gauge of how attractive a man is ranges from very handsome to
     <i>
      very
     </i>
     handsome," Estee managed through her laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     At this, even Rio joined in to the foray of laughs.
    </p>
<p>
     "We
     <i>
      are
     </i>
     lesbians," Agatha asserted over the rim of her mug and the laughter only doubled, a bellowing and brightly beautiful sound.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the meal had been pretty tame in opposition to the way it had started, but Rio eventually moved to clean up, rinsing the plates off before she put them in the dishwasher. Agatha had busied herself with refilling their coffees and Estee and Tay had declared that they were going to go to the beach and that anyone was welcome to join them, Nicky included if he ever returned home.
    </p>
<p>
     This had gotten a laugh out of the older women, but they had wished the two of them a good day as they departed with their beach bags slung over their shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment that door shut, Rio had reached up to turn off the tap, but she did little else before she felt Agatha's arms as they wrapped around her middle. She felt every single place that the front of Agatha's body pressed to her back, including the cheek that was pressed to her shoulder. Although it did feel nice, Rio understood it for what it actually was.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was processing. She had done an incredible job of keeping the mask up in front of the girls, but now that they were alone, she knew she had permission to crumble a little.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's right hand raised and landed on Agatha's arm, brushing softly at the skin there. "Do you want to talk about it?" she asked her softly, turning her head just enough so that her lips could brush the part of Agatha's forehead she could reach.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no verbal answer. Instead, she received a tightening of the grip around her waist and her eyes fell shut, a slow breath drawing into her lungs.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, she shifted, though she found a way to do so without making Agatha break her grip completely. She leaned back against the counter and reached up to cradle Agatha's jaw in both of her palms, looking her in the eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know that was a bittersweet thing to hear, and I know it hurt you. But... As hard as it might be to see it this way, he's learning from your mistakes. I'm not saying that you're not allowed to have very valid emotions about it, but he's acknowledging that he doesn't want you to feel the way he felt," Rio tried to explain. She had no idea if she was right, but it seemed like the most logical explanation.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I know,"
     </i>
     Agatha muttered softly, her lips turning down at the corners.
     <i>
      "It's just not something he should have had to learn at all. And as much as I can claim to be over it, I am sure there will always be interspersed moments like this where I realize that the things that make him a great human are the things I was never capable of."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Rio's eyes began to sting.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha,"
     </i>
     she admonished softly, her thumb moving to brush at her cheek tenderly.
     <i>
      "You cannot do that to yourself. And never is a very strong word. Maybe it was something you couldn't have done before, but you do it every day that you wake up and choose me, and our family."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio almost felt it before she saw it, the single tear that dropped out of Agatha's eye and hit the topmost part of her thumb which stopped it before it could go any further.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I really do work on forgiving myself for what I put him through, but I can't stop feeling like he will never not hold it over me. And I know that this isn't that, exactly, but... What I chose to do, selfishly, has clearly impacted how he operates in his day to day life. That's just.. a little hard to swallow sometimes, I guess is all."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio gave a gentle tug on Agatha's face, pulling her close enough that they could press their lips together in a gentle kiss, one she let communicate the forgiveness Agatha needed to be giving herself. After a moment, she pulled away, those beautiful blue eyes opening into her own.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Be kinder to yourself. You've made incredible strides with him the last several months. He doesn't mean harm, he's just... careful. And if that's the worst trait he picked up along the way? He's not doing half bad,"
     </i>
     she tried, and this seemed to settle into Agatha with a little more weight. It registered on her face as she looked at it through the perspective that Rio was offering.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I.. It's just..."
     </i>
     Even as she tried, Rio could see that Agatha was having a hard time fighting the logic. She knew Rio was right, and she admitted as much.
     <i>
      "You're right. I just think that I project my own ability to not forgive myself onto him and assume that he would stoop to my level because I raised him."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "But,"
     </i>
     Rio countered,
     <i>
      "It's because you raised him that he chose a different path. He loves us, and he just wants to make sure it's worth bringing home to the parents."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips twitched up slightly and Rio could see in her eyes as what she'd had to say began to sink in.
    </p>
<p>
     "How do you do that?" Agatha asked and Rio's grin was instant.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I put myself in your shoes and I tell you all the things I would need to hear, hard or not, to know that I'm still a good mom."
     </i>
     Rio leaned toward her again, stealing the softest kiss before she pulled back to gaze across at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she spoke again, Agatha leaned in and kissed her again. This one was a little harder, a little warmer, a little more full with the intent of making sure Rio knew exactly how she felt about her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you more than anything,"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed against her lips and Rio's own curled up into a small smile.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Not more than I love you."
     </i>

<p>
     "I've booked the tickets! The flight leaves Friday morning at six, which would put us in LA roughly around ten at night." Rio could almost hear the excitement in Agatha's voice as she shut her laptop and swiveled in her chair to face Rio where she was laid across the couch in the office, knees pulled up and a book resting on them.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, and she was wearing her glasses. She'd only put them on after Agatha had turned around and set to her task of creating them an itinerary for their trip to America.
    </p>
<p>
     "You little devil," Agatha nearly hissed, but she somehow managed to keep some integrity to her tone.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio simply lifted her eyes from her book and glanced toward her fiancée, the corners of her lips pushing up in the smallest smile, a very coy one for how innocent she tried to play it off.
    </p>
<p>
     "So," Rio began, moving to close the book in her lap and straightening out her legs, leaning back to stretch against the arm of the couch. "I expect you are going to run me ragged in our five days there?" Though her words were taunting, her tone was still sweet. It was only accentuated by the slight tip of her head to the side in an inquisitorial manner.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well..." Agatha offered back as she got to her feet and padded over to the couch. She reached down and hooked a hand under Rio's far leg, lifting with ease. She was clearly delighted as Rio lifted the other of her own accord so that Agatha could place herself beneath them, letting those toned calves fall across the tops of her thighs. "We have two venue viewings on Saturday, but I made them both in the afternoon so that we could sleep in a little if we're too jetlagged." Agatha's hand raised, but only to drop two fingers so that she could trace light lines up and down the surface of Rio's shin.
    </p>
<p>
     "So thoughtful," Rio teased softly, though a giggle tumbled from her not a moment later. The arm that was closest to the back of the couch raised so that Rio could slide her fingers through the hair on the back of Agatha's head, nails lightly dragging over her scalp. It caused Agatha to tip her head back into the touch, her eyes fluttering shut as the softest little hum rumbled her pressed lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "And what else?" Rio tugged, trying a little harder to unravel the plans Agatha was knitting together for them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sunday is another one. And --
     <i>
      mmmmm.
     </i>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stifled her giggle at the way Agatha seemed to be enjoying that contact on her scalp, so she simply kept going, the smirk starting to curl up her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "And?" Rio cooed at her, though her tone was thick with her feigned innocence.
    </p>
<p>
     "And if you don't stop that, we're not going to end up making it to the market," Agatha warned, her tone low.
    </p>
<p>
     Accepting that as a challenge, Rio pulled her hand away and let it fall to Agatha's shoulder, eliciting a grumble of disapproval.
    </p>
<p>
     "What?" Rio posed, tilting her head as Agatha's gaze snapped over to her. "I just needed you to focus so that we can both get through what you've been plotting for our trip, and also we need groceries. Those children of ours are eating us out of house and home."
    </p>
<p>
     The laugh that fell from Agatha's lips did something to Rio's chest in the way that it filled it with a swarm of butterfly wings, the lightest pink dusting her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, okay," Agatha conceded, though she had never stopped her motion of dragging her fingertips up and down Rio's shin; it was just a way to sustain contact, especially with her disappointment at Rio's insistence she focus. "Sunday morning we have a venue in Oak Glen, which is a little more inland, but that's the one I told you about with the blooms. Obviously we won't be able to see them yet, but they'll have photos we can go over. Sunday night..."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha trailed off, her eyes dropping to her hand as it made work of keeping the touch against Rio's soft skin.
    </p>
<p>
     "What do you have planned for Sunday night, my love?" Rio questioned sweetly, raising her hand so that she was mimicking Agatha's feather light touch, only along the side of her neck, down into the crook, and over what portion of her shoulder was exposed by the tank top she had on.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha cleared her throat in an attempt to distract herself from Rio's touch, and it seemed to be half-working. "I would really like to introduce you to Jack," she disclosed, her chin turning to hover over her shoulder as her eyes met Rio's across the length of her torso. "When I told him that we were flying in, he extended a dinner invitation. A double date, if you will," Agatha added, unable to temper the way that smile filled her face, bright and hopeful.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could have feigned indifference, but there was no reason to. The fact that someone Agatha cared about wanted to meet
     <i>
      her? Rio? Living-on-a-houseboat Rio? Nobody Rio?
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That wasn't fair. Perhaps for twenty years, she had only ever been Estee's somebody, but now things were different. Now, she was Agatha's somebody, too. She was the person that Agatha wanted to wear on her arm, the person who's hand she wanted to hold as they walked down the street no matter what city they were in or who was watching. She was the one Agatha ached to come home to when she was away.
    </p>
<p>
     It made Rio wonder what it would have been like to be a fly on the wall of the Landon home that night. The pictures themselves had been chaotic, and hearing Agatha speak about them had moved Rio in a way she hadn't been expecting. While they were clearly a tribe in their own right, Rio had not missed the way they had rallied around Agatha to become her tribe, too, when Rio and the kids could not be around.
    </p>
<p>
     What had Agatha told them? Of course it wouldn't have been anything negative; that wasn't even a thought in Rio's mind. Some locked away part of her was still curious, though, about what her presence was when it left Agatha's lips and fell into the ears of the people she cared about and trusted. It was very possible that it could have been the same things that Agatha told her day in and day out, but she couldn't help wondering sometimes what she looked like through those familiar blue eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     In the same vein, she realized that Agatha might never see herself the way Rio saw her.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio looked at Agatha, she saw a woman who had dealt with a lot of hardships that could have turned her into a different person entirely. She saw a woman who knew what her passion was from a young age and had done whatever she could in her power to see to it that it became her livelihood. Rio looked at that beautiful face like it was a work of art, and saw all the years of heartache and struggle and pain and success and love for her son and dedication to her craft. She saw the laugh lines, she saw the worry lines. Rio could see every spot of Agatha's face that had been touched by a momentous occasion in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha wasn't just a masterpiece.
    </p>
<p>
     She was a diamond.
    </p>
<p>
     She had started from darkness, nothing more than coal. As her life had worn on, pressure and heat and time all combined to turn her into the glimmering majesty she now was.
    </p>
<p>
     Sure, Rio might have been able to look at her hand to see one, but what was the need when the biggest, most beautiful, steadfast rock she'd ever wanted was right there?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips curled up slightly as she tilted her head against the cushion of the couch, her eyes locking into Agatha's. Her fingertips remained in its motion of caressing her neck and shoulder, but she finally found her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're sure?" she asked, that small shred of doubt seeming to win out for just a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's brow pinched but then almost immediately smoothed out. In the next second, her expression melted completely.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course I'm sure. We didn't have a whole lot of time for introductions when we were sealing ourselves in the little bubble of those first couple of weeks. But... Jack says he's incredibly eager in getting to know 'the woman he got woken up at 3am to call a jet for.'" As she finished with the little waving of her fingers to indicate a direct quote, Rio couldn't stop the laughter that overtook her and Agatha's own was almost right in tune.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was all his idea. We didn't decide on where to go, mostly because I wanted to make sure that it was okay with you," Agatha explained, though that soft gaze had never wavered from Rio's face and after her little air quotes, those fingers had resumed their work of gracing Rio's shin like they had never stopped. "But... he and Thea both asked me to relay that they would be honored to take the two of us out."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's expression had practically melted the longer Agatha spoke. She could hear the tenderness there, the affection. She could hear that this meant something to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had gathered that Jack was someone who might have started as a colleague, a co-creator, but he had evolved into a higher tier position in Agatha's life. He had become her friend. Rio had gathered that garnering such a title in Agatha's world was an accomplishment, something not many people earned the opportunity to do. Jack had done it though, and even in the small amount of time that Rio had been in Agatha's life -- objectively, at least -- she had watched him come through for her on more than one occasion.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think that would be really nice. I'd like to thank him personally, anyway." Rio's voice was gentle, but it was genuine. She had benefited from his string pulling, and in a way she felt like she owed him for the couple of hours he had helped keep Agatha's head above water when she'd been so far away from the people she called home.
    </p>
<p>
     As nervous as the idea of beginning to integrate into Agatha's very real, very public life could sometimes make her, this seemed like the safest place to start. Jack was Agatha's safe place, and that was something Rio could find comfort in.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, then Sunday night it'll be a double date with Jack and Thea," Agatha announced, her palm dropping to canvas Rio's shin wholly, giving a delighted squeeze. The way she lit up like that struck something in Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been stewing over the idea that she might not fit as seamlessly into Agatha's life as Agatha had fit into hers.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had simply been waiting for the right time to make it happen, having zero doubt that it could go any other way than well.
    </p>
<p>
     Using the strength of her abdomen, Rio pulled herself out of the arm of the couch so that she could reach up, tucking two fingers along the far side of Agatha's jaw so that she could turn her head back the way it had been just a few seconds before. Once they were face to face, Rio closed the remaining space between them with a kiss that she hoped could say what she couldn't find the words to.
    </p>
<p>
     That kiss told every whisper of how thankful she was. It was every murmur that could have said how much Rio loved Agatha. It was every shout to the world that this woman was the rest of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     That kiss was the most convincing thing Rio could manage when trying to make Agatha understand all the things she just couldn't find the right way to say.
    </p>
<p>
     As she pulled away, she was not surprised when Agatha sealed the space quickly again to steal the briefest peck.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand shifted so that the tips of her fingernails could graze along the nape of Agatha's neck. She had not missed the way Agatha shivered for just a moment, the goosebumps flaring and fading over her skin in rapid succession.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a steadying breath, her face turning toward Rio's again the slightest bit.
    </p>
<p>
     "There's a lot about my life that you have not experienced yet," Agatha told her in a gentle murmur, and Rio sensed by the way she said it that this was both a good and a bad thing. "Most of it, and most of the people, I cannot wait for you to see and meet. There are... other aspects that might be... a little more difficult to deal with."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had considered this. Although she did not truly understand the depth of it, she did understand that Agatha was famous. She understood that people knew who she was, that there were people who would go to see her films because she was the one who had directed them.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio did not understand was the sheer fanatics and disregard for the human condition that could come with such fame.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... even though I am aware that we are long past the point where it could fracture our relationship, I just want to make sure you understand that it might not always be easy, to be with me."
    </p>
<p>
     The way Agatha said that, it pulled on the strings that were tied to the deepest cockles of Rio's heart. It stirred an emotion in her that, at first, felt hard to place. The longer she took the time to identify it, though, the more she understood that it was an incredibly raw and real form of compassion.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's fingertips pulled from Agatha's neck and her hand easily moved to find her cheek, cupping it lovingly.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed at her, a quiet request for her to lift her eyes. When she complied, Rio's thumb brushed along the arch of her cheekbone.
     <i>
      "You know that despite just how easy it has been, that's never what it's been about for me. I know who you are, I know what you do. I know the company you keep. I know, even if I am sure I do not understand, the kind of attention that a powerful and successful woman like you draws."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The longer Rio spoke, the more Agatha seemed to lose the resolve she had been clinging to. Rio wasn't quite finished.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "But what I also know is that I love you with or without all of that. Your career had nothing to do with why I fell in love with you and it will not be the reason that I would ever stop, ever. Maybe it'll shock the hell out of me, maybe it won't. What it won't do is cause a rift between us."
     </i>
     Rio's words were quiet over murmured tones, but she meant every single one that left her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's chin tipped and she straightened up just enough so that she could place her lips to Rio's forehead in a light but loving kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Do you think this will ever make sense?"
     </i>
     Agatha muttered, her breath warm against Rio's skin.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Does it matter if it does?"
     </i>
     Rio whispered back, a light giggle passing the inches between them, landing like music to Agatha's ears.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "No, I suppose it doesn't."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     Come Friday morning, despite their insistence that they could get an Uber, all three children had woken up at four in the morning with their sleepy eyes and tousled hair to get Rio and Agatha to the airport. It had been the sweetest thing and it honestly had made it a little harder to leave them to fly six thousand miles away.
    </p>
<p>
     The girls had asked if the older women were absolutely sure they could not come, and even though they had been teasing, Agatha had simply promised them that the next trip made, they would surely be in tow.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't need to question it; Agatha was being cautious. She was wanting to see how this unfolded first, and even though they'd had that talk earlier in the week, some part of Rio couldn't help but feel like Agatha needed to prove to Rio that it might not be as simple as she had possibly convinced herself it might be. At the same time, if that were going to be true, Agatha did not want the children involved.
    </p>
<p>
     They had all loaded into Tay's Highlander and Nicky had used the GPS to assist him in their voyage to the airport. The ride had been quiet; everyone had been exhausted and the general mood of their departure didn't fall into somber, but it wasn't exactly elation, either.
    </p>
<p>
     Hugging their children goodbye had been bittersweet. Rio knew that she and Agatha were going to do, she knew what it would mean. She knew that they were beginning to build a true future for all give of them. That didn't make it any easier to turn around and walk away from those three beautiful faces, even if it was only for a few days.
    </p>
<p>
     The flight had been easier than the first one Rio had taken to America and she was fully aware it was down to the way that Agatha had booked them to fly first class. The way she had selected their seats meant that they could drop the center divider and be face to face, which Rio found great comfort in.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though they'd put on the same film to watch together, Rio had fallen asleep almost twenty minutes in. Agatha had found more interest in watching Rio than watching the movie. And then, she fell asleep too.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had woken up to check the display and see that they still had about four hours left in the flight. Agatha had still been asleep so she'd simply busied herself by playing solitaire on her phone despite having access to the wi-fi. Agatha had come-to a short while later and they'd munched on the snacks that had been provided enough to tide them over until they were back on American soil.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had declared with about twenty minutes to go that she did not care how late it was, the first place they were going to was In-N-Out.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, Gio had been waiting for them as they spilled out into the cool night air at the pick-up of LAX. Agatha had immediately notified him that his first stop was the first In-N-Out he passed, and with a chuckle, he had delivered an 'Of course, ma'am,' as he rolled up the partition.
    </p>
<p>
     They had sat in the back of that town car with their cheeseburgers and their milkshakes like they were teenagers after a night of drinking, giggling and gushing about just how good it was. It was a dose of the young love Rio had never gotten the chance to experience.
    </p>
<p>
     Falling into bed that night, a thought had passed through Rio's mind.
    </p>
<p>
     The last time Rio had been in that bed, it had been Agatha's bed. It had been a rest stop on Rio's journey across the world, a place she had never meant to stay.
    </p>
<p>
     The last time she had gotten out of Agatha's bed, she had been filled with fear and terror in a way that she had never known possible.
    </p>
<p>
     Pouring back into it, it was
     <i>
      their
     </i>
     bed, in
     <i>
      their
     </i>
     third home.
    </p>
<p>
     It didn't matter that there weren't any touches of Rio gracing the walls yet. It didn't matter that they'd not had the time to set up rooms for the kids, though Nicky already had his own. It had nothing to do with the practicalities; by principle, it was a third place they could call a safe haven.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha had correctly predicted, they had slept in the following day. Even when Rio had woken up a little too early and started to get out of bed, Agatha had simply hooked an arm around her and pulled her closer. It was those softer, more tender moments when Rio knew that Agatha was not actually fully conscious but still chose to hold on, that made her question how she'd gotten it so damn
     <i>
      good.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     With the feel of Agatha's breath on the back of her neck, it had been a task of ease for Rio to close her eyes and find sleep for just a few more hours.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd slept long enough that they'd woken up to the sound of Agatha's alarm that she had been smart enough to set to ensure that they would have time to get ready before they set out for the day.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been something about the way that Agatha had rolled over atop Rio's back as she laid on her stomach and Agatha peppered the side of her face with kisses that had pulled several seconds' worth of sweet giggles into the air of the bedroom that settled into the deepest recesses of Rio's soul.
    </p>
<p>
     She got to have moments like this for the rest of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     They were going to get out of that bed, walk into that big master bathroom, climb into that massive shower for an exchange of affection and appreciation, and then they were going to start making decisions on where they were going to get married.
    </p>
<p>
     And that was exactly what had happened.
    </p>
<p>
     They had grabbed a late breakfast at a bagel shop on their way inland and had continued about their day with their iced coffees in hand and sunglasses shading them from the midday sun.
    </p>
<p>
     As the car rolled to a stop, Rio realized that it was the first time she'd pulled her attention from Agatha and the little silly and stupid conversations they were having to look out of the window.
    </p>
<p>
     It was almost scary how easy it was to get lost in any moment with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     What met her gaze on the other side of that window was a large brick structure that had white trimming and pillars in all the right places. It was two story, but seemed almost bigger than it should have been even with the additional floor. It was beautiful, really, in a way had a difficult time explaining. It was clearly old but as Agatha leaned over, voice low, Rio hadn't expected her to say what she did.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "This is the second oldest brick structure in the San Bernardino Valley. It's called The Barton House. It was finished in 1904."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's smile had been hard to tame; the way Agatha floated it to her, like it was a secret even though Rio was sure it was common knowledge, spoke louder than the airy deliverance that had met her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had considered this place because of its history.
    </p>
<p>
     For Agatha, history was integral to character.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd made their way out of the car and met the guide who had been a shorter woman with dark hair and a pep in her step that Rio couldn't help but respect. The woman knew how to hustle, she'd give her that.
    </p>
<p>
     She was animated as she showed them around, indicating all of the different features and included deals. It was a gorgeous property, but something about it just didn't feel... right. It didn't feel like
     <i>
      them.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had been cordial in that businesswoman kind of way, assuring the other woman that they would be in touch, but Rio knew that she was just being polite. Rio had caught Agatha's eye on more than one instance and the conversation had been silent, but it had been heard. It was nice, sure, but the history wasn't enough to make it feel like it was the right choice.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd walked hand in hand back to the awaiting car and were on their way to the next destination.
    </p>
<p>
     The next venue, Agatha informed her as they arrived, was called Los Willows. There was a large lake on the back side of the property and one of the options for a ceremony was on the lake, which they had been shown almost immediately. It
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     damn near breathtaking, and Rio had not hesitated to voice as much, which had earned her a squeeze of Agatha's hand around her own. It was clear that Rio was a little captivated, but it went a bit deeper than that.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could see in every inch of the places they were being shown that day why Agatha had made these decisions. She could see the intention and the attention she was pouring into these choices and it left Rio with the motivation to be a little more proactive in the decision process.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the property had been just as gorgeous and while Rio had found a fondness for it, there was still the thought in the back of her mind that the one Agatha had been most excited about was still on the horizon. So, for as much as the entire feel of it was resonating with Rio, she would simply tuck those reasons into her pocket for the time being. Of course she had shared with Agatha on the car ride home all of the things she had liked and the very few that could have been better. They'd agreed on most of it in a way that Rio had been certain they would.
    </p>
<p>
     They had arrived home and Agatha had announced that they could order in for the night and she'd worry about getting a couple of day's worth of groceries for them the following day. Before she could submit their order though, there was a rapping at the front door and while Agatha's eyes flew to the door, Rio's had landed on Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew there was a gate. Rio knew there was a guard. So who could be knocking on the door without Agatha having been notified?
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Agatha got to her feet and made her way over to the door. While she might not have known exactly who it was, the way Agatha moved assured Rio that there was no reason to be alarmed. She sank back into the couch, though her eyes never left Agatha as she pulled the door open. Rio's eyes flicked up to Agatha's face in time to catch the smile as it lit up her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good evening, Dave," she greeted warmly, stepping back to allow the man inside. Rio noticed before anything else that he had a couple of bags in his hands that were emblazoned with a chic logo that read 'Tramonto Bistro.'
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio's eyes swept up, it was almost jarring to put a face to the man she had heard Agatha speak of so many times. She'd even heard Agatha rip into him a time or two, too. What Agatha had never put into words that Rio had always heard anyway was that Agatha loved Dave in a way that had been borne from years of loyalty and dedication. Dave was good to Agatha, so Agatha was good to Dave.
    </p>
<p>
     His jaw was strong but not quite chiseled, covered in something that was too thick to be scruff and too thin to be a beard, but it suited him well in that speckled white and grey color. The hair atop his head was trimmed on the sides but wound in short and unruly curls atop his head. His eyes were an absolutely stunning hazel color and that smile that found his face as he looked over and saw Rio was a little startling.
    </p>
<p>
     His eyes lifted to Agatha and that handsome smile only seemed to grow.
    </p>
<p>
     "I knew if I asked to meet her, you'd tell me no. So I went to Tramonto and I got you the Quattro Formaggi gnocchi that I know you absolutely will not turn down. I then took a risk and got both the Casarecci and the Del Tramonto and figured Rio and I could fight over them."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could both feel it in her own posture and see it in Agatha's as they both softened. This man clearly cared for Agatha in a very unique way and Rio could sense that it was not very often he got the chance to show it without any kind of push back from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     He lifted the bags up and held them out to Agatha expectantly who blinked at him for a moment in confusion. His eyes dipped to his hand, though, indicating that he wanted her to take the bags. Slowly and in a stunned manner, Agatha lifted the handles of the bags off of his fingers and the moment she did so, he was moving, crossing the room to where Rio had been occupying space on the couch. The moment Rio realized, she got to her feet to meet him.
    </p>
<p>
     With his pace, she'd almost thought he might hug her, but he stopped about a foot and a half in front of her and held his hand out.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ms. Vidal, it's a pleasure to finally meet you. I am David Crain, Agatha's -- "
    </p>
<p>
     "Right hand man," Agatha supplemented before he could offer his own opinion on his title. At this, Rio could feel even in the handshake as any tension in his muscles released.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, right. Well. I've heard quite a bit about you and suppose I couldn't wait to see what the buzz was all about. So please forgive me for crashing your evening."
    </p>
<p>
     "No forgiveness needed, Dave. It's a pleasure to meet you, too." Rio's voice was rich and smooth, trying to convey just how touched she was by his gesture. He released her hand and and turned back to Agatha who had moved closer, still holding the bags.
    </p>
<p>
     "You going to take these back and feed us so I can grab us a bottle of red?" she shot at him, though her tone was light and playful in a way Rio had never heard her speak to him before. He chuckled as he took the bags from her and she excused herself to grab the wine, though she did not hesitate to place a soft kiss to the apple of Rio's cheek as she passed by her to head for the cellar.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio placed herself back on the couch as Dave sat in the chair at the end of the coffee table and began to pull the food out of the bags.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, Dave. This was kind of you."
    </p>
<p>
     He didn't acknowledge her at first and continued about his work until everything was on top of the coffee table. He lifted his head, those hazel eyes meeting her own.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank
     <i>
      you,
     </i>
     Rio. You have no idea how much you've changed her life. And I realize I only have these ninety seconds to tell you, so feel what you need and then get it together so she doesn't know I'm loose-lipped with the things she won't even admit herself."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt emotional even as the smile formed on her face, but she drew in a slow breath and offered him a slight tip of her head accompanied by a light shrug of her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     "If it's even half as much as she's changed mine, I think I might have an idea."

</p>
</center>
<p>
     Having dinner with Dave had been a delight that Rio had not known she needed the pleasure of experiencing. There had been something about the tiniest little inflection in the way he spoke that had tugged at something deep in the core of who Rio had become as a person since the age of six, but she had tried to bite it back.
    </p>
<p>
     That was, until it became too hard to ignore.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had finished the bite of the spinach and ricotta ravioli that she had won in their debate and set her fork down, leaning forward on her knees as she watched Dave with vested interest.
    </p>
<p>
     "Where are you from?" she asked him curiously. His skin was darker, a smooth tan color that had not come from years in the sun. His eyes were dark but had an ability to reflect any light they pulled in. Something about him when she looked closer at him, studying him was... comfortable.
    </p>
<p>
     "I was born in Tahoe, up north from here," he responded, though by the smile that immediately found his face Rio knew he had something else he wanted to share. "But three years before I was born, my Irish mother and Māori father moved from Tolaga Bay."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes widened and her jaw dropped in shock. Had Agatha known this? Had Dave ever even told her? Based on Agatha's next question, though, Rio could safely assume he hadn't.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is that...?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Seven and a half hours from Auckland," Rio answered before Agatha could finish the question. Her eyes hesitated on Dave for just a moment longer before she turned to face Agatha who looked just as surprised as Rio did.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's nose scrunched as she tried to best phrase what she felt in that moment.
    </p>
<p>
     "If you wanted to award me with the World's Worst Boss placard for not knowing that, I wouldn't totally blame you," she offered him, but his deep and bass filled laugh sounded almost instantly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha, we have
     <i>
      never
     </i>
     needed to have a conversation about where our parents came from. I do not fault you for not knowing," he told her, though he was still laughing over the idea that she seemed to think of this as some kind of egregious error.
    </p>
<p>
     There was something Rio saw in Agatha's eyes, though. It was guilt. She'd spent nearly two decades with this man by her side and she didn't even know his roots. As quickly as it had appeared, though, it seemed to flicker away.
    </p>
<p>
     That had been the first instance of their dynamic but the longer the night wore on and the more wine they drank, the more Rio simply sat back and enjoyed the show. She would chime in when it was warranted, but watching them in a back and forth meant that she could observe and learn, that she could see the history that was so rich and thick between them.
    </p>
<p>
     They verbally sparred, challenging each other on whatever topic they had landed on, not to force perspective but to change the lens instead. They could debate different points of view without growing frustrated or upset. The way they held conversation was completely fascinating. They were two equal individuals who did not place themselves higher than the other when it came to an intellectual understanding.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could tell why Agatha respected Dave.
    </p>
<p>
     With some of the points Dave made, Rio could also see why Agatha was cursing at him a great deal of the time, even if those points were valid.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time the three of them had drained that bottle of wine and their meals were completed, Dave did not waste time in getting to his feet in a way that signified he was not going to overstay his welcome.
    </p>
<p>
     "I best be off," he offered with a kind smile. Agatha stood first, but Rio was quick on her feet a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
     She let Agatha pass in front of her to give him a warm hug.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, David. It was an unexpected surprise, but a pleasant one nonetheless. And you got what you wanted out of it, I assume?" she posed, cocking her head as she stood back with her hands on her hips, as if she were being a petulant teenager.
    </p>
<p>
     The way all three of them burst into tipsy laughter melted that stance right out of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     As she stepped back, Rio took her previously occupied spot and wrapped her arms firmly around Dave, giving him a firm squeeze, though there was little more that needed to be said between the two of them. He'd gotten his point across in the moment alone and Rio hoped that she had, too.
    </p>
<p>
     As she sidled up against Agatha, looping an arm around her waist, Dave hesitated at the door and lifted his head to look back at them. His grin registered a bit mischievous before he spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "Please, for the love of god, behave." He paused for a moment, his gaze lifting to Agatha. "I don't want to have to pay out thousands of your dollars to purchase photo rights to you punching someone in a restaurant mid-day."
    </p>
<p>
     What he had said could have been a lead anvil being dropped right on top of them. They both knew what he was referring to, and from the way Agatha had never brought it up, Rio was not sure even she had known that it may have been something that had happened. It was heavy enough, and rooted in enough of Rio's past trauma that it very well could have done a little unintentional damage. What he added only seemed to soften it, though.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't need to know, mostly because it was probably deserved. But... You don't need a reminder from me that there's someone paying attention at all times."
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, David," Agatha returned, her voice conveying her gratitude more than the words could.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, thank you Dave. We appreciate it more than you know," Rio felt compelled to add, even though she was sure he had a pretty good idea.
    </p>
<p>
     "Goodnight ladies. Have fun in Oak Glen tomorrow. It's truly a beautiful spot."
    </p>
<p>
     With that, he let himself out and pulled the door shut quietly behind him.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio loosened her hold on Agatha, but only so she could look over at her better.
    </p>
<p>
     "I see why you love him," Rio cooed at her, though Agatha was quick to feign disregard as if she didn't know what Rio meant by that as she blew a huff of air through her nose.
    </p>
<p>
     "You don't have to say it out loud for it to be true," Rio prodded a little further, though Agatha's head turned and met Rio's gaze. She looked a little sheepish, as if admitting that she knew exactly what Rio was insinuating.
    </p>
<p>
     "He's okay, I guess," Agatha offered, though her smile grew.
    </p>
<p>
     They both knew that Dave had taken up the role of being Agatha's rock for the last eighteen years. Maybe he wouldn't have said it in so many words, but he was relieved to see Agatha find that comfort and solace in someone else once she had met Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "He seems to keep you in line," Rio teased, digging a light finger into her side with a soft chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     "He
     <i>
      is
     </i>
     pretty good at that," Agatha agreed, craning across the space between them to give Rio a soft kiss. "Let's clean up and head to bed."
    </p>
<p>
     "Wait," Rio pushed, placing a hand in the center of Agatha's chest. Agatha's gaze dropped back over to her, a little stunned, but Rio didn't leave her waiting long. "It makes me happy to know you have him. He would very clearly step into the line of fire for you. That's a very rare kind of loyalty to have."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression softened and the look in her eyes was both one of understanding, but also one of appreciation.
    </p>
<p>
     "Little does he know I'd do the same for him."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had pressed her lips one last time to Rio's forehead before they separated to gather the empty containers left over from their --
     <i>
      incredibly delicious
     </i>
     if you asked Rio -- meal. The clean up was quick and Agatha, as always, had led her upstairs to their little haven of a bedroom by the hand.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment they crossed the threshold, Rio could almost feel as the exhaustion from their day and the remaining jetlag seemed to dump right on top of her. They'd undressed, but before Agatha could pull on a shirt, Rio had stopped her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I just want to feel your skin tonight,"
     </i>
     she requested softly, and this seemed to be perfectly fine with Agatha who unceremoniously dropped the shirt right back into its drawer.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment they slid into that bed and Rio turned on her side, Agatha did not skip a beat in sliding right up behind her. The moment Rio felt every single place where the skin on the front of Agatha's body touched the back of her own, it had been a struggle to keep conscious. She had managed to succeed just about as long as it took her to whisper to her finacée.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Sweet dreams, my love. I love you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It could have been possible that Agatha returned the sentiment as she gave Rio's middle a light squeeze, but Rio had dozed before she'd heard it. Agatha had even realized it as she placed a kiss to Rio's shoulder and let herself fall asleep, too.
    </p>
<p>
     The next morning, Rio had woken up briefly when Agatha had removed her hold from around her. She had let out a soft grumble of disapproval but it smoothed into a soft hum as she felt Agatha's lips press to her cheek right before she whispered that she was going to go make them breakfast.
    </p>
<p>
     This had satisfied Rio enough that she was able to fall back asleep for a little while longer in that big bed of theirs.
    </p>
<p>
     When she woke up almost thirty minutes later, she could smell in the air a mixture of a fresh pot of coffee coupled with whatever it was Agatha was making. Rio reached up and swiped her phone off of the nightstand to see that she had a couple of messages from Estee who informed her that they were doing fine and had not caught the house on fire yet.
    </p>
<p>
     With a breathed chuckle, Rio had shot back a message indicating how much the three of them were missed by herself and Agatha and included in it that they were thankful for the lack of pyro work. When it sent, she closed her phone and removed herself from bed. She busied herself with brushing her teeth and pulling on a tank top and pair of shorts to move about the house in, growing more and more enticed by the smell that was wafting from downstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     After pulling her hair up into a disastrous bun atop her head and not really caring, she finally made the descent to a sight she knew she would never get sick of.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was at the stove, moving about with the precision she always maintained when in the kitchen, once again so absorbed in her work that she had not heard the soft creak of the stairs when Rio had come down them. Her hair was in a long braid that hung down the middle of her back -- impressive work for having not asked for help -- and although it was not Rio's jersey she was donning, it was still one of Rio's t-shirts that clung to her torso.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio did take a silent moment to appreciate her life and the woman she loved for all that they were, she did not let it linger for too long. Her approach was still quiet, but her hands fell immediately to Agatha's sides before they moved around to her front, wrapping firmly around her middle. She placed a soft kiss to the back of Agatha's head before she tucked her chin over the other woman's shoulder to take in her work.
    </p>
<p>
     "What're you making, my love?" Rio murmured softly in her ear, the grogginess still a little heavy over her words.
    </p>
<p>
     "It dawned on me this morning that you have not yet been introduced to the American staple of sausage gravy and biscuits," Agatha informed her, turning her head enough that Rio understood she was asking for a kiss, which she happily provided the moment before she laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     "It sounds absolutely repulsive," Rio informed her, but what she saw on that stove? It didn't make sense with the description provided, but it
     <i>
      smelled
     </i>
     incredible.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey don't knock it until you try it," Agatha returned haughtily, though the laughter that spilled from her lips indicated that she was having her fun.
    </p>
<p>
     As it turned out, Agatha hadn't been wrong. There had definitely been a bit of trepidation on Rio's end, but as she finally allowed herself to overcome the mental block, it was actually pretty delicious. The 'biscuits' as Agatha had called them looked more like a scone, but the texture and taste were both different and not in a bad way. The salty and buttery biscuit itself paired with what Agatha called a gravy -- but Rio still could not reconcile as one -- was a unique taste, but after the second bite, Rio had decided she actually liked it.
    </p>
<p>
     "I wouldn't call myself a convert, as it still makes little sense, but I will say that it tastes incredible. But... very little do I doubt you once you step foot into that kitchen," Rio offered in low praise, though the look on her face was more tender than it was povocatory.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned toward her, over the corner of that very long and very regal table that Agatha headed up every single time she sat at it. That was one thing that Rio hoped never changed. Agatha was the captain of their family, the one who made the tough calls because she knew she had to, even if it upset everyone in the process. She was the one doing the legwork in finding ways to cement their future. She was the one who would take charge of whatever situation she needed to in order to do what was best for those she loved.
    </p>
<p>
     "Be real," she prodded, a playful smile on her lips. "Very little do you doubt me, ever."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's brows raised in faux surprise, but her smile was almost instant.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know me so well, my love," she returned, her tone light as a air. Her grin tempered only in the way that it was absolutely necessary so that they could share a sweet kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Finishing breakfast, Rio had been insistent on clearing the table and getting the dishes loaded, but she'd had an ulterior motive in asking Agatha to get the shower running so they could get ready for the day.
    </p>
<p>
     The look she'd received in response wasn't the one she'd thought she'd get and in turn, it left her feeling a little touched. There was this warm softness to Agatha's entire demeanor the moment she registered the question, like she recognized that Rio was true to form in her mischievous ways but also craving something that had become routine for them.
    </p>
<p>
     They had habits. They had routines. They had patterns and processes.
    </p>
<p>
     As a unit, they'd built this life, and Rio couldn't have been more in love with it if she tried.
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The drive into the valley had been a sight that while almost felt familiar to Rio, had its own distinctive qualities as well. Despite the lack of flowers, it was an incredible sight. The mountains stood resolute and tall, majestic in their stature that reached toward the sky. The greenery that lined the sides -- only having returned in recent years due to the fires in 2019, Agatha informed her -- offered a serenity that seemed almost out of place for the rocky peaks that protruded from it.
    </p>
<p>
     As the car rolled slowly into the lot, Rio could already see the vision and they hadn't even gotten out of the vehicle. She didn't need to see the blooms to understand why this had been the one place Agatha had mentioned first.
    </p>
<p>
     As they toured the property, each step they took was a step closer to Rio understanding that this was the place they were going to tie their lives together. There was a small pond bordering this one, but there was also the most adorable little wooden bridge that arched over a part of it that Rio could already see being used for photos. The shrubbery that lined the water was still dotted with flowers, though they weren't as majestic as they ones the guide had shown them on her tablet.
    </p>
<p>
     There were several other places, including a
     <i>
      absolutely breathtaking
     </i>
     greenhouse that almost moved Rio to tears, that were surely intended for photo opportunities. That was the one, the one that made her grip Agatha's hand tightly in her own as if somehow managing to say that they needed to look no further.
    </p>
<p>
     They had still continued, though, through the rest of the property. When the woman had led them to where the ceremony would be held, Rio's eyes prickled with the threat of tears but she swallowed them down, damn near fighting for her life to not completely break down at how beautiful that view was. The platform itself had a circular metal frame atop it that the woman explained was wrapped in flowers and vines for the ceremony. Rio could already envision it and it made her heart pound a little harder in her chest. The view beyond it, though, was what really took her breath away.
    </p>
<p>
     The edges of mountain ranges were woven into each other, though the small buildings in the valleys were visible even from where they were, though they looked no bigger than the size of ants from that perspective. It was
     <i>
      perfect.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The last place to see had been the reception area, which yet again was impossibly beautiful. Rio could almost picture it in her mind's eye, the way Agatha's friends and loved ones would fill the space to eat and drink and celebrate the fact that they were choosing to spend the rest of their lives together. She could see their children dressed to the nines, laughing together. The mere thought of the introductions Nicky would be making between the girls and friends he had known for years was enough to almost choke Rio up.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had not missed a single thing.
    </p>
<p>
     The
     <i>
      piece de la resistance
     </i>
     had been the moment the woman had pulled up something on her tablet, indicating that they were running a special on one of the packages that was inclusive of a special detail.
    </p>
<p>
     When she lowered the tablet, both sets of eyes fell to take in the image of the white carriage that was led by two white horses.
    </p>
<p>
     No fucking way.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked up at the woman in disbelief, simply blinking at her. Was this real life? This woman was standing there telling them that a perk of booking an already otherwise perfect venue, was that it came with a fucking horse-drawn carriage.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had seemed to take charge of the moment where Rio was so clearly having a moment of reconciliation, yet again, that this was what her life had become.
    </p>
<p>
     Politely, Agatha had indicated to the woman that the two of them needed a moment to discuss and the woman gave a nod and stepped away. At the same time, one of Agatha's hands hooked around her arm and pulled her a little closer.
    </p>
<p>
     "What do you think?" Agatha questioned softly. Judging by that knowing look on her face, she was aware she had not really needed to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was staring ahead at her, completely verklempt. Agatha had known. Even though she had provided options, and they'd been suitable, she had always known that this one would be the one. And so, all Rio could do in the moment was state as much.
    </p>
<p>
     "You knew," she managed and in a way, it was half an accusation and half a realization at the same time. "You knew this would be the one I'd want, even before the utter insanity of you being delivered to me by a
     <i>
      horse-drawn carriage?!
     </i>
     " The giddiness was apparent not only in her tone, but it was painted over every last inch of her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey! Who said it was going to be me?!" Agatha managed back as she moved forward to wrap her arms around her wife-to-be.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did. This is one executive decision I get to make."
    </p>
<p>
     "Ooh, okay bridezilla," Agatha murmured at her. Her grin was wide, though, and Rio couldn't help but roll her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hush up, you," she growled playfully before leaning in to steal a brief kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had handled the rest of the transaction, though Rio had been right by her side watching everything, reading what they were given, and signing the contract for the reservation. Despite the fact that the total the woman announced right before Agatha slid over her card was completely insane, Rio had long since learned to stop assigning value to a dollar amount when it came to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Whatever Rio wanted them to have, they would have. Agatha could provide and so she always would.
    </p>
<p>
     Once finished, they each shook the woman's hand and bit her a good rest of her evening. Agatha had checked the time, hissing a soft
     <i>
      shit
     </i>
     under her breath.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're going to be late for dinner reservations. I should text Jack."
    </p>
<p>
     As they slid into the back of the car, she had done just that and informed him that they were on the way but the tour had run over a little longer than expected. As Rio did not doubt, he had assured Agatha that it was fine and they would see them when they got there.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stowed her phone and lifted her arm so that Rio could fit herself beneath it, snug against Agatha's side. The ride was quiet for a few moments, but Agatha finally found her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is there anything you want to know before we get there?"
    </p>
<p>
     This perplexed Rio who lifted her head so she could meet Agatha's gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is there anything I
     <i>
      should
     </i>
     know before we get there?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's response was instant, a gentle shake of her head with a slightly pinched brow that smoothed not a second later.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, no. Of course not. I mean, other than reformed Hollywood playboy with a heart of gold. I..." Agatha paused, a warm smile curling her lips. "I suppose that I see a lot of myself in him. He's got vision and drive and he has never taken no for an answer. More than that, he's aware of his place in the industry in the kind of way that enables him to support others in the community instead of trying to contend with them." She paused, pursing her lips slightly in thought. "So, he might be a little better than me. At least, when it comes to anyone who isn't him."
    </p>
<p>
     Her soft chuckle was met halfway by a giggle from Rio who sensed that even between them, it was a bit of a humbling thought for Agatha to have.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, I'm very excited. And Estee has messaged me twice to ask if we've met up with them yet. I think she might be a little more excited than me," Rio returned in a soft murmur, tightening the arm around Agatha's middle that had been holding her close. "I'm just happy to get to meet the people who care about you. It's nice to see the way they look at you."
    </p>
<p>
     "What do you mean?" Agatha returned, tones inquisitorial.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean... I know how I look at you, and I know how the kids look at you, because you are our world. But, take Dave for example," Rio offered. "When Dave looks at you, I think he sees someone above his station that he respects. At the same time, he looks at you as someone who, even outside of your working relationship, is still worth putting on a pedestal."
    </p>
<p>
     The slightest shift in Agatha's posture signified to Rio that perhaps that was not something Agatha had ever stopped to give much thought to.
    </p>
<p>
     "So," Rio concluded, "I'm excited for two more perspectives on the woman I love most in the world from the people who care about her."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was clearly in a battle to not roll her eyes, but she seemed to win for the moment, though the look she offered Rio tried its hardest to be admonishing.
    </p>
<p>
     "That optimism is..." Agatha had started, but Rio was quick to interject.
    </p>
<p>
     "Your favorite thing about me."
    </p>
<p>
     "Always."

<p>
     Rio's hand felt warm in Agatha's grip as they bumped along in the back of the town car on the way to their dinner date. She was so unassuming, as she always was, that when the car began to slow and pull toward the curb, her gaze flickered to the window for a brief second and cut away again. As what she saw began to process, her brow knit together.
    </p>
<p>
     They were sitting outside the Freehand.
    </p>
<p>
     They were right outside the first place Rio had tucked into the moment she had landed in America.
    </p>
<p>
     That hotel room had been her safe haven in those first few days of trying to get her feet under herself with Agatha's help. That had been the place the seed of their love had first been planted. It had since been repotted several times. In that hotel, in room 2315, they'd decided to sink it into the ground to be nurtured.
    </p>
<p>
     That was the place where their love had started to bloom.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha..." Rio voiced, her tone hushed and filled with the sweetest mix of shock and curiosity. "What are we doing here?"
    </p>
<p>
     "We're meeting Jack and Thea for dinner," Agatha informed her. There was something about the way her voice rang, still so soft, with the slightest tinge of sheer giddiness.
    </p>
<p>
     "But this is the Freehand," Rio pointed out, as though it weren't completely obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     "It is. And... I don't know how much research you did before stalking me..." Agatha teased, the smile audible in her voice before Rio saw it spread to her lips. "You would know that The Broken Shaker sits on the roof."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's expression pinched for a beat, but then smoothed, her cheeks a little pink with her embarrassment at not, actually, having known that.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did not do enough, apparently," Rio returned as Agatha pushed the door open and climbed out, pulling her behind by the hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was Jack's suggestion. He didn't know and I didn't tell him. Or you. For this very reason," Agatha informed her as Gio pulled away from the curb and left them standing at the foot of that hotel, a sense of nostalgia washing over Rio like the tide on a hot summer day, warm and all-encompassing.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're..." Rio started, though her lips twisted as she turned to look at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "The sweetest, most sentimental fiancée you could ever ask for?" Agatha returned airily, but that wicked grin across her lips sang another tune, one that told Rio she was up to something.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, my love. That's exactly what I was going to say," Rio responded, making a quick move to snatch the breath of a kiss off of Agatha's lips before she could form any rebuttal.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're already late, but I don't think we should keep them waiting while we get all sentimental," Agatha prodded, giving Rio's hand a gentle squeeze to indicate they should get moving.
    </p>
<p>
     They wound their way through the familiar hotel lobby and Rio had been unable to keep herself from glancing across at the bar and to two seats they had occupied the first night Rio had spent in America. She hadn't expected to ever be back there and to see it all again after everything that had changed in the last several months. It was emotional in its own way, even if it was touching at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     What she Rio not actively anticipate was what it would be like to step foot in that elevator again. The elevator where she had made out with Agatha for the first time. The elevator where they had been so engrossed in the task of learning what the other tasted like for the first time that they'd stood there long after they had reached their floor. The elevator where Rio had come to the realization that she was in it deep, and Agatha was in the trenches right next to her.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment the doors slid shut, Agatha leaned back against the wall of the elevator and gave a tug on Rio's hand, pulling her to her in a way that left their front's pressed together. Agatha dropped her hand to wrap her arms around Rio's waist, leaning in just enough to bump the tips of their noses together in a way that pulled the lightest giggle from between Rio's lips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "We are not making out in this elevator before you introduce me to your friends,"
     </i>
     Rio murmured at her, though she did not hesitate to punctuate such a statement with a quick peck.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha raised an eyebrow in silent challenge, clearly mulling through words to find what she wanted to say.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So after, then?"
     </i>
     she shot back, stealing a brief kiss of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     This earned her a light jab with a lone finger to the ribs and cause that bright and beautiful sound that Rio was so fond of to bounce off of the walls around them.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Can you blame me? I'm feeling... sentimental."
     </i>
     Agatha's voice was just as gentle as the intention behind her words, even if that mischief still lurked in the lowest registers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had started to speak, but the elevator signified they had arrived at the roof level and the doors pulled open. Rio turned, still clutching Agatha's hand and let her lead the way. They had gotten about halfway through the dining area when a man in the corner got to his feet, the woman next to him doing the same. He moved around the end of the table as the two of them approached, a wide smile on his handsome face.
    </p>
<p>
     The first thing Rio noticed was his eyes. They were strikingly blue against the contrast of his tan skin and dark eyebrows. His hair was a dark brunette color flecked with almost imperceptible blonde patches, and a short beard of the same color hugged his chiseled jaw. He simply
     <i>
      looked
     </i>
     charming.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha stopped short of him, Rio did the same next to her side. He grinned at Agatha, but his attention turned to Rio as he held a hand out. She took hold of it, giving a gentle shake.
    </p>
<p>
     "You must be Jetplane Jack," Rio teased softly and she could see immediately the delight that washed over his expression.
    </p>
<p>
     "And you must be Boat Woman," he returned, a boyish gleam in his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "That I am," she offered back. "It's a pleasure to meet you. I've heard a lot about you."
    </p>
<p>
     He dropped her hand and took half a step back so that he could usher his partner forward who did not hesitate to introduce herself as well, offering her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm Thea and I have been on the end of the line in the game of telephone enough to assure you that we have heard a lot about you, too."
    </p>
<p>
     There was something about Thea that struck Rio somewhere in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     It could have been the long dark hair, the softened features, or even those beautiful dark eyes, but whatever it was, she reminded Rio of Estee. Estee, who was probably sitting at home eagerly awaiting a text on what it was like to meet a member of the Landon family.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio's hand dropped again, she could see as Agatha and Jack parted from a hug and Agatha moved to do the same to the younger woman, telling her how good it was to see her again.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd taken their seats and Jack was almost instant in his move to pull the bottle of wine over and fill the two empty glasses that had been waiting for their arrival.
    </p>
<p>
     That first sip of wine was
     <i>
      exquisite,
     </i>
     Rio thought. It was rich and deep with notes she could not quite place, but cherry had been the most obvious. The way it lingered on her tongue was satisfying in a way few things often were.
    </p>
<p>
     Once they were all relaxed and comfortable, Jack placed an order for the ceviche so that they would have something to pick at while they talked. Rio had come into this with the suspicion that this was not going to be a quick share-a-meal type of gathering, and while it had slightly contributed to her nerves, she could already understand why this was the company Agatha willingly chose.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, any chance you've given it more thought? I'm just as hungry now as ever," Jack opened as he leaned back in his chair, his hand clearly reaching for his girlfriend's beneath the table in the same moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha rolled her eyes, her own hand finding the top of Rio's thigh at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're like a dog with a bone," Agatha chastised, tipping her chin at him.
    </p>
<p>
     It took Rio only a moment to catch up to content of the conversation, having used enough of the context to get her there.
    </p>
<p>
     He was talking about making their life into a movie.
    </p>
<p>
     Something about it thudded into Rio like she were a gong and that deft strike sent a deep wave of vibration into the air around them. This was soundless, though, in the way that only Rio felt it as it shook her very bones.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had many a conversations with her daughter about the fact that what had happened to her wasn't practical. She'd met a woman and they'd spent an amazing night together in a way that had somehow been romantic, but also kept the air of staying platonic. That air had never lost its charge, even as Agatha had fallen asleep with her head in Rio's lap.
    </p>
<p>
     The romance had won out, though, the moment Agatha had taken those few steps and kissed her. Then, she was gone and Rio could still taste that kiss on her lips hours later.
    </p>
<p>
     In the quiet hours of the early morning when Rio found sleep difficult, she would often replay those parts and pieces she had clung to in the wake of Agatha's absence. Rio had never known what it was like to miss a stranger and it had been enough to spark the kindling within her.
    </p>
<p>
     Kindling that Estee had tended to with a careful hand and measured caution. She had known just where to push to get Rio to buckle and had easily applied just the right amount of pressure to make it happen.
    </p>
<p>
     In the throes of understanding, something struck Rio that -- stupidly -- she had not once stopped to consider.
    </p>
<p>
     For everything she had told Estee, there were surely things that Agatha had turned to Jack to vent about.
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them had managed surface level conversations about their time apart, but the depth there was something Agatha had left unexplored when it came to discussing it with Rio. Clearly at their reunion outside of her office, she'd been given some idea that Agatha had discussed her with people she cared about, but Rio hadn't thought that it could go
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     deep.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe, Rio was starting to realize, she had not been the only one devolving into insanity at having met someone she felt drawn to and had no way to ever reach out or see them again.
    </p>
<p>
     It was very possible that Agatha had sat up in that office, staring out of those windows, wondering what it could have been like if things had been different. Rio knew it was possible because she'd sat on her deck, staring at that bridge as she did the exact same thing.
    </p>
<p>
     Having been privy to everything since, Jack still had that hunger to show what they had to the world. It could have been intimidating, but Rio felt... astounded.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been a lonely woman who spent too much time hunched over her laptop pouring countless hours of her life into something she knew would make a difference in the world. She might have garnered an award here or there in her field, but not much else would come of it in terms of notoriety. That wasn't something that bothered her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been content -- no, she could no longer say that and believe it. What Rio had been before Agatha toppled into her life had been
     <i>
      complacent
     </i>
     , not content. She had fallen into the steady thrum of routine in a life that was solely her own. She'd had acquaintances, made nice with her neighbors, but Rio's distrust of humans at large had kept her shrouded in her loneliness.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, she'd met a complete stranger who felt the same way. Even not knowing who she was or what she did, it had been apparent through their conversations, through the way they had chosen to speak to one another throughout the night. Those low tones had been ones of betrayal in even the most miniscule ways. They were just ways neither of them had understood at the time.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had realized perhaps a beat too late that the conversation had carried on as she had been grasping the idea that her life was literally something that an incredibly successful Hollywood director wanted their permission to share with the world. Of course she had heard Agatha the few times she had mentioned it, but maybe she hadn't actually
     <i>
      heard
     </i>
     her.
    </p>
<p>
     Sort of in the same way she hadn't really heard what the other people at the table were talking about.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been a soft pressure on her thigh, one that seemed to reel her back into the moment. Agatha was still holding conversation with Jack and as Rio began to understand what she was hearing, it was clear that he and Thea were gushing about the puppy they had just gotten. The conversation had evolved beyond Rio's cognition, but Agatha seemed to be aware that those cogs were moving, gears clicking into and rolling out of place and Rio had just needed time to process.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't being star-struck. She genuinely had no idea who these people were outside of their importance to Agatha, but it was the power that came with a position like his that seemed to floor her. She appreciated the dedication, but what she appreciated more was just how genuine he seemed to be, even on several different avenues of conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     They had discussed a variety of things over their shared ceviche, from Thea's family to Jack's latest project.  Agatha had detailed to the two of them a little more about her sabbatical and how it was likely she would hit the ground running once things settled down after the wedding. That was a talking point that had garnered silent action from Rio, who had wrapped her hand around Agatha's where it had stayed perched on her thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     They had placed their dinner orders, but no sooner had the waiter walked away than Jack's attention was on Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, I have heard bits and pieces from this one," he began, flicking a hand to indicate Agatha, but his piercing blue eyes had never left Rio, "but I hear that you have two fans at home. And I hear they are very intelligent and accomplished fans, at that."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's smile was instant, but it was a little bashful. Those girls' accomplishments had little to do with her, but she understood the sentiment.
    </p>
<p>
     "We do. And they have probably checked their phones at least fifty times by now for any sign of an update," Rio offered with a smile that grew a bit, the fondness for her daughters so clear in her voice. She did not miss, though, how Jack's eyes dropped to where her phone sat toward the edge of the table.
    </p>
<p>
     "May I?" he asked with a boyish grin that caused a ripple of realization to quake through Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, it smacked into her even harder as it settled.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha looked at Jack, she saw parts and pieces of her son, ones that seemed to fit into parts and pieces of herself and combined into this charming young man.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio nodded and picked up her phone, unlocking it with ease and opening the camera app before she handed it over to him. He did not waste any time in swiveling around in his seat so that he could extend a long arm, holding the phone sideways so that, as Thea leaned in, the four of them were in frame.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did not waste the opportunity and scooted her chair closer to her fiancée, leaning against Rio as they all looked toward the camera and beamed, the four smiles in that photo bright enough to light up the night sky. He snapped a couple more, encouraging a variety of expressions.
    </p>
<p>
     On the last one, Agatha was lightning quick as she reached for Rio's chin, turning it with the gentlest curl of her fingers so that she could kiss her the moment Jack snapped the picture.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oooh, that one's my favorite!" Thea declared as Jack lowered the phone to survey his own handiwork for a moment. The way Thea craned in to look, too, made something melt even further in Rio's chest.
    </p>
<p>
     The other couple was clearly at least ten to fifteen years their junior and yet, it felt like being in the presence of equals. It was funny how life worked like that, wasn't it? There were people Rio's age that could still behave like children, and then there were people like the two on the other side of that table who were clearly still young, but had lived so much life in that time.
    </p>
<p>
     After another moment of inspection, Jack proudly forked the phone back over to Rio, that grin still plastered across his face.
    </p>
<p>
     "
     <i>
      Please
     </i>
     do not wait to send those," Thea pressed, her grin almost as bright as her boyfriend's.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, please. I think it's some of my best work."
    </p>
<p>
     Those grins were very obviously infectious as one found Rio's face, too. She set about the quick work of sending the photos of the four of them to her daughter. Once finished, she set the phone to the side and had every intention of letting that be it.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned her attention back to them as she reached for her wine glass with the hand that had not landed on Agatha's thigh after their mini-photoshoot.
    </p>
<p>
     "So Agatha said they graduated not too long ago? What were their majors?" Jack posed, the genuine interest so clear in the way he had asked the question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well," Rio began, "Estee, who is actually mine, graduated with a BCs Honors, which is a bachelor's of science with a minor in psychology."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Thea lit up in a way Rio had actually known to see coming.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, she absolutely
     <i>
      has
     </i>
     to meet Cole. She's my sister-in-law but she's a psychologist, too. She does a lot of amazing work with LGBT youth and kids who have trauma from bad foster situations," the younger woman nearly gushed.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, those two together would be an absolute sight," Agatha chime in just before she took a sip of her own wine. "A meeting of the minds that could stop the world."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio softened in the way she did every time Agatha praised who Estee was as a human being.
    </p>
<p>
     "And Tay, her girlfriend, graduated with a BACom, which is a bachelor's of arts and commerce. Her plan is to find an architecture firm one a home base is officially settled upon."
    </p>
<p>
     Across the table, Rio found the expressions of two people who were thoroughly enjoying these little bits and pieces of her and Agatha's life together that Rio was willing to share. Surely, they'd heard enough from Agatha to understand, but she could see what it meant to them to hear it from her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do they want to come here?" Jack inquired, though his interest was not pointed, just curious.
    </p>
<p>
     "They definitely would love to visit, probably before the wedding, but we shall see how that plays out."
    </p>
<p>
     It was Agatha who spoke next, her hand landing atop the back of Rio's as she leaned forward slightly, but only to smooth the stem of her wine glass between the fingers of her other hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "When they do, Nicky will likely be with them. I tell you, it's like three peas in a pod. It's... adorably insane how quickly they've fallen into... siblingship?" Even as the word left her lips, Rio could see the disbelief for the brief second it passed over Agatha's expression.
    </p>
<p>
     "How is he doing?" Jack posed, but as Agatha went to answer, their meals arrived.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was already almost full up with the things she had been feasting on during their time together. Once everything was placed and the waiter departed after making sure they didn't need anything else, Agatha seemed to not miss a beat.
    </p>
<p>
     "He's... got a boyfriend, apparently?" she offered, though her laugh that immediately followed showed how tickled she actually was by it.
    </p>
<p>
     "No shit?" Thea managed, her eyes shimmering with the amusement this brought.
    </p>
<p>
     "He's Māori, and according to the girls, 'very handsome,'" Rio divulged, though she threw up her free hand to provide air quotes over her last words, eliciting laughter from the three other people at the table.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good for him," Jack mused before he washed down a bite of his food with a good pull of wine.
    </p>
<p>
     "It does something to my mom heart," Agatha admitted. This caused Rio to steal a glance at her, trying to read her profile for the briefest moment that her eyes lingered. "I'm sure he's dated since he left, but... This one hit a little different. In a good way."
    </p>
<p>
     The conversation had stayed like a steady stream between the four of them for the duration of their meal, and Jack and Thea had even kept it up when Agatha excused herself to use the washroom.
    </p>
<p>
     The only time it seemed to stall was when Rio suddenly realized that Agatha had been gone for a suspiciously long time. She reached for her phone to see that Estee had sent her nine messages since she had received those photos, but Rio wasn't concerned with opening them at the moment. Instead, she pulled up Agatha's contact and started to type a message asking if she was okay, but only having hit two keys, the chair next to her slid out and Agatha placed herself directly in it.
    </p>
<p>
     "I was getting worried. Are you alright?" Rio asked as she looked over to Agatha. It could have been overbearing, but she knew Agatha knew her well enough to know that she was simply concerned.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm fine, my love." To prove her point, Agatha leaned into her and pressed a soft kiss to her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio's eyes swept back across the table, Thea's cheek was in her own palm and her elbow was on the table as she looked at the two of them adoringly.
    </p>
<p>
     "You both are sickeningly sweet," Thea voiced, her grin growing.
    </p>
<p>
     "I second that," Jack tacked on, a bassy and deep laugh following his statement.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd talked a little longer before they had all mutually agreed to pack it in for the evening. Jack had made them promise -- more Rio than Agatha -- that this was something they could do with some sense of frequency, even offering to find their way to Rio's neck of the woods at some point. Jack had even made a very casual mention of how he would love to see the houseboat. It had forced Rio into a genuine grin as she released him from their hug and stepped back to do the same to Thea, assuring her that the girls would be more than pleased to make her acquaintance in the future.
    </p>
<p>
     As Jack and Thea departed, Agatha had taken hold of Rio's hand and tugged her toward the railing that ran around the rooftop, looking out at the city shrouded in night before them.
    </p>
<p>
     "That was impressive," Agatha blurted, looking over at Rio with a grin on her face. The question on Rio's face was almost instant and Agatha picked up on it. "You just... sat a table with one of the most revered young couples in Hollywood and you absolutely held your own. Maybe you haven't wanted to talk about it, but I am almost certain you have worried about what it would take to fit in to this side of things. And you just...
     <i>
      do it.
     </i>
     With Dave, with Jack and Thea." There was this hint of wonder in Agatha's voice but it was only that much more moving when Agatha raised Rio's hand to press her lips to the back of it.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am constantly in this suspended state of being completely certain that there is nothing you could do that could possibly make me love you more. And then... you go and do it without even trying."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked over at her, the gentle affection for the woman she loved completely taking her under.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm just..." Rio hesitated, lips worrying for a moment. "I'm just being myself." She gave a gentle shrug, though after a moment she leaned in to steal a soft kiss. "I guess you're not the only one that finds that to be fascinating."
    </p>
<p>
     The way Agatha's expression smoothed and that tender light flickered in her eyes caused that familiar squeeze to happen in Rio's chest.
    </p>
<p>
     "Let's go, my love," Agatha offered, not hesitating to steal one last kiss before they peeled away from the edge and headed back to the elevator. Agatha seemed to be on her best behavior during their ride down, which Rio suddenly found quite suspicious, but she did not press.
    </p>
<p>
     As they unloaded into the lobby, Rio had been under the assumption that Gio was outside waiting to take them home where they would pour into bed and she was almost certain that Agatha was going to find a way to make her feel every bit the queen Agatha saw when she looked at her.
    </p>
<p>
     She was surprised and quite caught off guard, then, when Agatha gave her hand a firm tug, leading her to the front desk. She was completely stunned, left blinking as the man at the desk seemed to recognize Agatha, a warm smile filling his face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is it ready?" she asked him, though her tone was level and even, not overly frantic or hurried.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maid service should be done within the next few minutes, but I'm able to give you the key now if you would like," he responded.
    </p>
<p>
     "Would you comp their meals for the rest of their stay to my card as well?" she added on, to which the gentleman nodded and set about his task. As he grabbed the correct key, he slid it across the marble edge of the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     "Room 2315, Ms. Harkness. They should be done within the next five minutes."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt like she'd turned to stone, like the entire weight of her form was so heavy that she could have sunk right into the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you. Have a good evening."
    </p>
<p>
     "You as well, ma'am."
    </p>
<p>
     With that, Agatha began to pull Rio away but after only a couple of steps, Rio planted her feet, the disbelief still coursing through her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," she asserted, warm green eyes questioning as they fell into those electric blues the moment Agatha whipped around to realize Rio wasn't moving.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, my love?" she posed innocently, feigning indifference.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you about to take me up to the room we stayed in when I first got here?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grin seemed to be the only answer she was willing to provide for the longest moment, her eyes wrinkled at the corners with how wide it was.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, my love."

</p>
</center>
<p>
     Rio hardly felt like she was moving, like she was the one actually in control over her feet carrying her forward. Even as Agatha stopped at the bar and leaned over it just slightly to request that a bottle of the finest wine they had available and two glasses be sent to room 2315, Rio did not think she would be moving without Agatha's assistance.
    </p>
<p>
     Room 2315.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had really done that. She had said the dinner location was unintentional, but something about this felt
     <i>
      very
     </i>
     intentional. It felt
     <i>
      very... Agatha.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The moment the elevator door shut, Rio was actually surprised to realize they would not be doing a play-by-play of their first time in that elevator. Considering Agatha's goading earlier in the day, she'd expected something other than the way Agatha mimicked her actions from that evening on their way up and pulled her close as she leaned against the wall.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned in, stealing the briefest and softest kiss before she pulled to look back into those homey blue eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "And why was maid service cleaning out that room at nine-thirty at night?" she posed, a hand landing flat on Agatha's chest, though her thumb and forefinger moved to pinch some of the fabric, rubbing it between her fingertips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes dropped to where Rio's hand laid and her lips turned down at the corners in ignorance, as if she had no idea. "I guess they must have moved to a different room."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes narrowed playfully and she raised her hand to place a finger beneath Agatha's chin, forcing her gaze to lift so that their eyes could meet once again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is that so?" Rio pressed, both of her eyebrows arching as if to turn up the volume on her interrogation. "Then why on earth would you comp their meals for the rest of their stay?"
    </p>
<p>
     At this, the placidity Agatha had been fighting to maintain slipped and her lips split wide in such a beautiful smile that for just one moment, Rio forgot to breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well..." she began, though her cheeks only seemed to push up higher with that grin. "They might have moved because I covered half of their stay and wired them five hundred dollars."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes were wide in an instant and her hand dropped from Agatha's chin to swat lightly at her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha!" she nearly squealed, both from the shock and from the way Agatha's strong arms secured around her middle in a tight embrace. "I want to say I cannot believe you, but... this checks out."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had hardly finished speaking before she had started to laugh, but Agatha's lips were on hers after another blink, stifling any sound she might have made pretty quickly. The hand that had been hovering between them, just above Agatha's chest, settled again in almost the exact same spot it had been moments ago.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't a desperate kiss, wasn't one that was begging for immediate attention in other places. It wasn't a grab for clothing or heavy pressure on body to wall.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a kiss that Rio understood to be a desire for nostalgia and familiarity, just remixed in a more tender way. It was a kiss that somehow made her heart skip a beat, but then soften in its thuds against her ribcage. It was a kiss that wordlessly informed her of just how much Agatha loved her, and the lengths she would go to in order to show that love.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of the elevator dinging caused Rio to pull away from the exchange, but she didn't go far. Instead, she stayed close enough that she could smell that cherry wine on Agatha's breath.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Sometimes I don't know what to do with you,"
     </i>
     Rio mused in a soft whisper, though it was not meant to be alluring. I was instead a statement of her wonder.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could not be contained. She would never be boxed in or caged. It wasn't for a lack of trying on the world's part, certainly. No, Agatha was something beyond capture, something that would break through any constraints she was placed in.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was the sun. She was so hot and full of fire in regards to how intensely she lived life, but there were other facets of that to be explored, too. She was light, she was vision. She was illumination of some of the darkest parts Rio had ever known existed in herself.
    </p>
<p>
     What it meant to finally lean out of Agatha's grap and take her hand to walk that familiar hall to that familiar room was surreal in its own right. They had walked out of the door they now stood in front of with the intention of moving forward. Now, for a night, they got to go back.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could still recall the way they had been laying in bed and she had nearly shot up to announce that she was ready to go. She could still remember what it felt like as that certainty hit her that she would have been happy anywhere as long as Agatha was right there with her. She could almost feel the weight of what it had felt like when the realization that something cosmically was binding them together had managed to slide under her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha slipped the key into the lock and pressed the door open, actually seeing the room again made Rio want to cry. Not because she had any doubts or questions about a single decision she had ever made in that room, but because she remembered so suddenly every choice she made in that room that had led her closer and closer to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to pick up on the hesitation and gave Rio's hand a light squeeze, leaning into her so that she could place a kiss to the side of Rio's head.
    </p>
<p>
     "Come on, my love," Agatha requested in a light tone as she moved forward to tug Rio inside. Just before the door closed and clicked shut, there was a call from down the hall.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha dropped her hand and moved to catch the door before it closed. With how wide she had pulled it back open, Rio had been able to see the man in his hotel uniform as he brandished the bottle of wine and glasses Agatha had requested on a tray. They made the exchange and Rio could have sworn she heard Agatha apologize for not having cash and that his tip would be added to the room.
    </p>
<p>
     A moment later, the door shut and Agatha turned on her heel with the tray in her hands. She was grinning again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio made her way to the familiar side of any bed they slept in and slid atop that impossibly soft duvet. Her eyes cast toward Agatha who was making quick work of pouring them each a healthy glass of the red wine and while there was not an active smile on her face, it was instead threaded through her entire posture.
    </p>
<p>
     There was nothing pressing about it, like Agatha's plan was to get her drunk and strip her down. Instead, the fluidity of her movements was unhurried and calm. For as ornery as Agatha could be, and for as much as Rio had assumed she was being inceredibly sly in orchestrating all of this, Rio realized that for the first major time in their relationship, she had misread the room. She had misread Agatha. Not entirely, of course. She knew that want in Agatha's eyes all too well, but for the time being, it was tempered by the reminiscence that was being offered to them, held within those walls.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio extended a hand to cradle the glass Agatha offered her before she joined her on the bed, in her spot right against Rio's side.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head turned and she was ready to ask Agatha what it was they were toasting to, but the contemplative look that was visible on Agatha's profile as she stared into her wine gave Rio pause. It lent to a moment of silence where she let Agatha just... process.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been right, that very first night on the houseboat when they had sat on her deck and drank their wine.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked beautiful when she thought.
    </p>
<p>
     The idea had been absurd on that first night, but now, Rio could justify it a little more. Agatha took the time to sort through the own mess in her head to find the perfect way to convey what she was feeling, what she was thinking. She compartmentalized the unimportant so that he focus was on what mattered, and how conveying that could be tricky but so necessary.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, after just a little while longer, Agatha raised her glass. She still did not look at Rio for a second, but then she turned, bringing her glass a little closer to Rio's.
    </p>
<p>
     "To room 2315," she offered and while it was a toast, something to celebrate, the undeniable tenderness was there so plainly. Agatha was not loud, she was not exuberant. She was reverent. She was nostalgic. She was appreciative.
    </p>
<p>
     Of everything she could have said, it was the most appropriate and emotional thing she could have picked.
    </p>
<p>
     The curling of Rio's lips that happened was one that bled with admiration, with affection, and she couldn't keep herself from leaning those few inches toward Agatha to place their lips together in a kiss that only lasted a few seconds.
    </p>
<p>
     "To room 2315," Rio agreed, moving her own glass so that the rims clinked softly together.
    </p>
<p>
     At the same exact moment, they both leaned back against the headboard. It was a motion that drew a quiet laugh of acknowledgement from both of them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you know how much I love you?" Rio posed as she brought the wine glass to her lips, though her brows arched pointedly as she glanced over at the woman beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's own head turned so that they were a little more eye-to-eye, but that smile seemed to be stuck to her face in a way that it could not even be pried off with a crowbar.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think I have
     <i>
      some
     </i>
     idea," she managed back. She took a quick pull from her own glass, but she apparently had a follow-up. "I mean, you love me enough to forgive me when I leave the milk out. And... You love me enough that you will sometimes organize the papers on my desk because you can't stand to see them cluttered and you know I don't have the wherewithal to do it myself, no matter how much it irritates you."
    </p>
<p>
     There was a pause and Agatha took another sip of her wine. "You love me enough that even when you're mad about me leaving my clothes everywhere, you still pick them up to wash them. You love me enough that when that happens and you're frustrated, you still kiss me before bed, even if you lay with your back to me but still lay close enough that your little butt is touching me."
    </p>
<p>
     "My butt is not little!" Rio clipped back as her brow pinched and she used her free hand to gently hit Agatha's stomach.
    </p>
<p>
     "And you love me enough that you don't actually get mad when I call your butt little," Agatha added, the wattage on that smile only seeming to increase. In turn, it only made Rio smile, too.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, I guess I kinda do love you that much. But don't sell yourself short, either." Rio's voice was low, quiet, but only in a way that was facilitated by the warmth she was feeling both from the alcohol and also from Agatha's overt display of her love by landing them there.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh?" Agatha posed back, her expression communicating that she was intrigued to hear Rio elaborate.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, I mean... You love me enough that when you trip on the hose because I left it out when watering the garden, you still tell me you love me even though you're angry and in pain. You love me enough that when you wake up in the middle of the night and I'm not in bed, you come find me in my spot in the back yard and sit in my lap until my desire to get you back in bed and comfortable again compels me to go back inside with you."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted the glass to her inner hand so that she could reach up with the far one to tuck some of Agatha's hair behind her ear. "You love me enough that you forgave me ten seconds after I offended you when I told you that cinematography was more important than dialogue in a film." Rio's lips curled a bit more, though the stretch of her lips conveyed far more than just her joy.
    </p>
<p>
     Above all else, Rio knew that she was thankful for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     For her, that went beyond just loving her. It was a recognition of everything that had been accomplished since they had met, how things had truly changed who Rio was as a person beyond just who she was when she was head over heels in love with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're right, I do. And I'll love you enough to forgive you no matter how many times I skin my knees. And I'll love you enough that when I can't find you, I'll follow the trails of you to bring you back to me." Agatha closed the space between them with a brief peck before she pulled back, those blues so soft in the way they were filled with the light of her honesty. "And I will always love you enough to make sure you understand that you are my everything, even if we disagree."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio closed the gap again, this time with a kiss that had more intent, a kiss that said what she felt too breathless to say in those moments.
    </p>
<p>
     What did one even say when the woman of their dreams was looking them in the eye and telling them things like that? Would there ever be any string of words, any verbal articulation that would somehow be able to make Agatha understand that when Rio was with her, she didn't feel completed, but she felt complimented, like two bigger parts had come together to make something that expanded beyond the original size? Would there every truly be any way, within either of the languages she spoke, to get Agatha to understand what every second of time they spent together meant to Rio?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't think so, so she let her kiss speak for her.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no rush as their lips smacked softly, Rio's palm having found its way home as it curled against the curve of Agatha's jaw, holding her firm but also having enough leverage to bring her closer when Rio wanted. Even after a few moments, the heat did not elevate and the frenzy seemed to be staved off between the both of them for the time being. Agatha was actually the one to pull back, her eyes fluttering open only a single blink after Rio's.
    </p>
<p>
     Once again, teeth were showing in a wide and genuine smile and Rio could feel her heart fluttering in her chest at the sight.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's... weird, isn't it?" Agatha mused, seeming to fight herself for a moment before she tore her eyes from Rio's to sweep around the room.
    </p>
<p>
     RIo's own gaze followed, simply taking in a sight that she could have still so accurately described from the images in her mind. It was peace, in its own way.
    </p>
<p>
     "When Jack told you that we were meeting here, did you know you were going to do this?" Rio posed, her head turning back to take Agatha in, though Agatha kept her gaze on the walls, just scanning them.
    </p>
<p>
     "No," she answered almost so automatically that Rio was tempted to call her out. Then, her lips twisted and left the corners turned down the tiniest bit. "In fact, I had been actively fighting myself on doing so for the majority of the night. Until about two minutes before I excused myself."
    </p>
<p>
     This perplexed Rio and it showed on her face as Agatha's gaze swept toward her.
    </p>
<p>
     "What changed your mind?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's features pulled the slightest bit, but it was the way her eyes were darting around over the terrain of Rio's face, that same twisting of her lips happening as she searched for words.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am just so completely floored by your ability to adapt to any situation you're put in." It was a statement, one that held weight and and an earnest sense of sincerity. "You don't have to put in any effort, it seems like. You just..." A soft puff of air blew through Agatha's nose. It struck Rio that she was struggling, that the words weren't as easy to find as they had been so many times before.
    </p>
<p>
     "I guess it's just that I've spent so long drowning myself in work and bad choices that I didn't even realize that I was doing it because I was trying to fill this gaping hole I've carried around in my chest for so long. I... I thought, due to my mother's conditioning, that it was because I needed a relationship and a child. So I got blackout drunk with a sound tech on one of my first films." Agatha stopped, understandably compelled to put her glass on the stand by her side of the bed. Rio mimicked the action and the moment her hand was free, Agatha made a grab for it, holding it in both of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     This was a moment Rio had known would come. It was never one she would have asked for, but with it so close she could almost feel it, she simply placed her other hand over Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took a breath and then continued.
    </p>
<p>
     "The next morning I hated myself. I had known my entire life it wasn't what I wanted, but I had forced it. It wasn't anything he had done, it was just... It was wrong for me. And I had every intention of not making the same mistake twice and moving in my own way and doing what it was I wanted. And while I didn't ever cross that line again... And I had walked away confident in that decision... And then..."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew. She knew before Agatha said it.
    </p>
<p>
     "And then Nicky happened," Rio concluded, giving Agatha's hands a firm squeeze to communicate that she understood, even if Agatha was already aware. Sure, their situations were vastly different but there were enough similarities that Rio finally understood why Agatha had always been so empathetic.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had never asked for what happened to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had completely incapacitated herself to make a decision she had been conditioned to believe was the right one, only to find self-loathing and a lifelong responsibility of raising a child.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sensed that there was a lot more to uncover there, but it seemed as though Agatha was satisfied with where it had ended up.
    </p>
<p>
     "All of that was a roundabout way of saying that even with doing what I thought I could, even having my amazing son, even chasing every dream I've ever had... That hole never went away." Agatha paused and drew in a slow breath. "Then, I spent six hours with you on the deck of your home and it was the most whole I could ever remember feeling in... Damn near my entire life."
    </p>
<p>
     The longer Agatha went on, the more Rio could feel -- very acutely -- as the backs of her eyes began to sting and burn. Agatha had said a lot of flattering things to her over the course of their relationship, but there was a depth here that they had not quite reached before.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know that each and every single person that you have met in my life had undeniably questioned my sanity when I explained to them what happened and how I felt about it. And every single interaction I have watched between you and those people... I've gotten to watch it creep in, the light of dawning as they begin to understand. In the way you told me that you liked being able to see me through the lens of the people that care for me... There has been something so... utopian about watching the people I care for as they see for themselves every reason I am so hopelessly devoted to you."
    </p>
<p>
     That had done it. The hot emotional tears finally found their escape, spilling over Rio's lids to roll down her cheeks. Agatha was quick in releasing her hand to reach up and brush them away. She cradled Rio's cheek in her palm, that loving look in her eyes so goddamn honest.
    </p>
<p>
     "I could almost guarantee that I could throw you into a room with the entire Landon family and you'd come out with twenty new friends. Because... they love me. And who you are is a part of me, now."
    </p>
<p>
     The emotion that had completely taken over Rio left her stunned for just a moment, enough to blink through a long strand of thoughts, but she knew it was pointless to try and use words, yet again.
    </p>
<p>
     As she moved her face closer to Agatha's, however, she did not press their lips together. Instead, it was their foreheads that fell flush, warm skin against warm skin.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "We really have to find a stronger word than 'love,'"
     </i>
     Rio whispered to her, though the kiss she offered immediately after was not one intended to initiate and she separated their lips only a moment later. It was only because she had something else to say.
     <i>
      "I want to tell you something, too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The expression on Agatha's face shifted from affectionate to attentive, though the look in her eyes was still warm.
    </p>
<p>
     "The night that we came back here... And you told me that you were going to get in the shower... The way you looked at me like that? I completely froze." Rio paused and in the lull, she picked up Agatha's arm and lifted it so that she could fit against Agatha's side, to be closer to her as they headed into this conversation. "I was
     <i>
      so
     </i>
     fucking scared. It had been over twenty years since I'd willingly been naked in front of another person. And I'm not self-conscious by any measure, but it was the intimacy of it for me. It was letting myself literally be bare in front of someone who, realistically, I'd known for a couple of days."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's free hand had resumed its hold on both of Rio's, giving them a gentle squeeze of support.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yet the things we had done in that day alone were practically shouting in my face how much you loved me before either of us were ever going to even consider the possibilityof saying it aloud. And I just... I knew I could keep being afraid, keep worrying, but then I asked myself what the point would have been. If it was ever going to be anyone, it was going to be you."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted her head back slightly, pressing her forehead to the side of Agatha's neck as she drew in a slow breath to try and reorganize her thoughts.
    </p>
<p>
     "I knew it the night before... I even told you, but you were asleep."
    </p>
<p>
     With the way her ear was pressed to Agatha's shoulder, Rio could still faintly hear the way her breath caught somewhere in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     "Told me what?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's voice dropped to the softest whisper, so reminiscent of the way she had said it the first time.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I told you that I wasn't sure if I was ready yet, but I already loved you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     This time, when Agatha's breath hitched, it was somewhere higher up.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio..."
     </i>
     Agatha managed, but Rio was intent on elaborating.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I got that message from Estee that night and it had completely wrecked me. I should have been worried about what you would think of me having a breakdown like that, but with the way you reacted, I understood why it had never crossed my mind."
     </i>
     The emotion began to ripple through her voice, quaking the stability of her words.
     <i>
      "And now, we sit here, all this time later and you have conquered my demons in a way I never thought could ever happen. You completely took hold of the situation and you did what you felt needed to be done to not only protect me, but to make me understand that you were always on my side."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The tears had started spilling again, a lot faster this time and Rio was in an active battle to keep calm long enough to press on.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I... I have never told you what it felt like that day, and I don't know that I can now and still make it understandable. Overall, it was... pitch black. But there was a pinhole, the smallest bit of light. It was broken enough to let in the sound of your voice. I could hear you, and gods, I tried so hard to respond. I tried to yell back, to tell you I was listening, but nothing came. Even as you threw me over your shoulder and got me into the car... I was fighting to tell you I was sorry, to tell you I didn't mean to worry you..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Despite the valiant effort Agatha had been making at trying to keep Rio's cheeks dry, she had left her own unattended and as a result, they were wet, too. Rio had known that the day would come when she found a way to tell these things that she had kept so close to her vest, but she had not thought it would happen within the year, at the very least. What she had not expected was for Agatha to feel it so profoundly in the way that she was wearing it over her entire being.
    </p>
<p>
     Somehow, Rio dug a little deeper and pressed on.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And then you crawled in front of me, you pressed my hand to your chest... And I was aware of it. I knew what was happening, but no matter how hard I fought, I couldn't give you what you were begging for."
     </i>
     Rio's voice had started to crack in a variety of places, but she was so close to making her point.
     <i>
      "Then, you pleaded with me to come home to you. And I fought so hard I thought it might break me even more. But... It worked. I could feel you beneath my fingertips, I could see you, I could smell you. The darkness just... finally went away, and there you were brushing my skin and calling me beautiful."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could see it, every single place in Agatha's body where here muscles seemed to melt in an emotional show of understanding. She could see how Agatha's comprehension of the situation had evolved the longer Rio spoke. There had been so much that had gone unsaid about that day and while that might have seemed out of character for them as a couple, Rio had simply needed the time.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "So you are absolutely right that I am going to love you enough to forgive you for whatever mistakes you make, even if it might take time. You are entirely correct when you say that I love you enough to handle you at your worst and your best. I do those things for you because I've experienced how you do them for me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand was moving, raising to cup around the hook of Rio's jaw so that she could pull her closer. The kiss she had on offer was different than the few ones before it.
    </p>
<p>
     Those had been gentle, those had been soft.
    </p>
<p>
     This was almost crushing, both in its physicality and in its emotional weight. Just before it had the chance to cross the threshold of an elevation of heat, Agatha pulled away.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you, Rio Vidal. And gods be damned, I'm going to until the day I die."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha moved again, surely to press their lips back together, but Rio's head tucked back just enough to prevent that from happening. The moment Agatha opened her eyes, though, she was met with nothing but utter reverence in Rio's entire expression.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And I love you, Agatha Harkness, always."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her again, her hand raising to land on the side of Agatha's neck, fingers sliding to tangle in hair. Their lips parted once more, but remained only a breath away. It left little room for the words that left Rio's lips to make it to Agatha's ears.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And I'm going to take this night to show you every way in which I mean it."
     </i>

      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     The moment after Rio voiced her intent, she had started to shift. With the wine glasses in their temporary homes on the nightstands, it left her the ability to move without hinderance. It was fluid, the way she got to her knees and was able to pivot in a way that both turned her to face Agatha and allowed her to swing a leg over her lap.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio lowered herself to Agatha's thighs, Agatha's hands knew where to go as they fell onto Rio's hips, fingers sweetly sliding into the belt loops of the denim shorts she had been wearing for their day's adventures. Rio could only tell because as Agatha did so, she could feel the tiniest tug on the waist of the shorts.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hands landed flat atop the lilac blouse that was adorned on Agatha's chest, palms flat against her sternum the moment she was settled. It was not a moment that contained urgency, not a single second needing to hurry in its ticking toward more time. They were not in a rush to peel off layers and immediately slip into bare bones.
    </p>
<p>
     There was nothing but their love and the familiarity of that room and what it meant to grow there that surrounded them.
    </p>
<p>
     That alone was enough to stop the world as it spun around them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat, just looking. She was just watching, simply taking the time she wanted to value this shining rock of a human being, her diamond. She could see at every single point where the light shined off of her, how it refracted onto several points in any given space.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha didn't just light up rooms. She blinded them.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Do you know..."
     </i>
     Rio whispered into the stillness around them as one of her hands raised, three fingers curling into her palm, so that she could trace a light line across Agatha's hairline.
     <i>
      "What the first thing I noticed about how beautiful you are was?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had not realized it but as she was speaking, tracing that feather of a touch on the shore of hair and skin, Agatha had been holding her breath. She only released it the moment Rio finished her question, their eyes padlocked in a warm but tender gaze. Almost imperceptibly, Agatha shook her head.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It wasn't your smile,"
     </i>
     Rio mused, her hand lowering so that another finger straightened out and with two fingertips, she gave the gentlest trace of Agatha's lips. The expression this elicited was almost a helpless one, only made more severe by the way Agatha sank back into the pillows. Rio's touch lifted and then shifted, tips of fingers landing between her eyebrows. With barely-there pressure, they dropped down over the slope of Agatha's nose.
     <i>
      "It wasn't your nose, even if it's my favorite feature of yours."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Fingers lifted once more as they reached the tip, shifting down to graze the patch of flesh where Agatha's neck connected to her ear. That contact moved down, curving around that strong angle of Agatha's jaw.
     <i>
      "It wasn't the absolutely striking angle of your jaw, or..."
     </i>
     Rio trailed as those fingertips began to ski down the edge there,
     <i>
      "the little dimple right here,"
     </i>
     she concluded, landing on Agatha's chin.
    </p>
<p>
     Once more, Rio's touch disappeared from Agatha's skin and floated up, landing almost in the same spot between her eyebrows as before, but it didn't stay. It graced over the curve of one eyebrow and then moved to do the same to the other. Then, those fingers fell to trace the downward arch of her bottom lid, one and then the other.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It was your eyes."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Those very eyes seemed to glass over almost instantly. Agatha's throat bobbed and her lips pressed a little tighter together as the emotion swelled within her. She stayed quiet, though. She was letting this wash over her, letting Rio's words blanket her in the warmth and sincerity they had to offer.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I looked into those eyes as you got to your feet, absolutely soaked from the marina water, and for a moment... It was like existing outside of time. It was like I saw every pool, every inch of ocean I've ever swam in. It was like seeing an endless view of the bluest skies on the sunniest days. It was... looking into an expanse of azure depth that I could absolutely drown in."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's touch moved again, lifting to gingerly place a finger on either side of Agatha's nose, just below her brows. It was more an indication of what she wanted, and Agatha seemed to understood and closed her eyes. Rio's fingertips brushed just barely over her eyelids before the touch was gone entirely and she leaned forward, placing the most gentle kiss to each eyelid. As she leaned back barely an inch, that hand raised again and the tips of her fingers caught Agatha's chin, the pressure provided giving enough direction that Agatha tipped her head back.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes stayed closed.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio scooted forward and her hand fit against Agatha's jaw, cradling it like the precious material she was, she leaned over just enough. Her hair fell down over her right shoulder, a few random strands tickling the side of her face, but not enough to be dealt with in the moment. There were more important things to tend to.
    </p>
<p>
     The way Rio's hand was curled around Agatha's jaw allowed her to raise her thumb, pressing it so softly to Agatha's lips. It caressed, just a few seconds, in a back and forth motion from corner to corner before it landed dead center again. More pressure was applied, pulling the lower one down just slightly as Rio dipped her head the rest of the way to catch Agatha's upper lip between both of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been some part of Rio that had expected Agatha to resist such a softhearted showing of emotion, to push back at being doused in affection in such a manner. However, the moment their lips touched, Rio could literally feel it beneath her as the tension seemed to evaporate right out of her lover's form.
    </p>
<p>
     The hand that had been situated on Agatha's chest finally found its gumption to move. It slid up and over the crook of Agatha's neck and up over her ear, fingers tangling in those long locks, fingertips surfing over scalp in an ocean of hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Their lips pressed and pushed, sucked and smacked the longer they kissed. When Rio felt Agatha's teeth everywhere at once the moment she sunk them into Rio's bottom lip, there had been no hope in stifling the soft moan that reverberated off of the walls of her throat, just barely making it out of the confines of her lips and straight into Agatha's mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     The curling of Agatha's tongue against the under side of Rio's lip only seemed to entice another, dragging it from those lungs and swallowing it whole.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hands had not moved location once, but fingertips had sunk into the places they were stationed, just an attempt to hold onto the moment, and to reinforce the reality of keeping a grasp on the woman she loved as she sat there in her lap and showered her in attention that was designed to fill her with love until she was spilling over.
    </p>
<p>
     Removing her hand from Agatha's jaw, Rio's fingertips began a dance, a tango across Agatha's skin as they wound down the side of her neck. They stopped to perform a Giro on her collarbone, a Boleo across the divot at the base of her throat, and lastly a Gancho into the open hem of Agatha's blouse, hooking it into the curl of her finger. There was a light tug, but not one that indicated that Rio might be worked up enough to ruin that shirt, too.
    </p>
<p>
     For as right as
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     had felt in that particular moment, it was wrong for the one they currently found themselves in.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, their kiss continued, deepening as Rio's tongue pressed into Agatha's mouth. The hand palming Agatha's head untangled from her hair and dropped to meet the other one at the first button that was fastened on that blouse.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, as their tongues pressed, it wasn't a battle. It wasn't a quest for domination and control. Instead, it was a gentle skimming of feeling. It was a slow dance at last call. It was a carefully choreographed tangle of what it felt to be that close to someone and still be an individual.
    </p>
<p>
     Even sustaining that contact, Rio miraculously found the wherewithal to get that first button free, hands lowering to repeat the motion. It was slow going, but she worked her way through them. Triumphantly, as she popped the last one, she pulled her lips from Agatha's who gave the softest whine in protest. It only drew a ghost of a smirk from Rio who sat back atop Agatha's thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hands nestled into the fabric of the open parts of the blouse, giving a light tug to indicate that she wanted Agatha to sit up a little, to let her know she wanted her closer.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha complied, back leaving the comfort of the soft pillows. One of Rio's hands released the shirt to slide into Agatha's hair again, pressing their lips back together in a kiss that almost reached the gentleness of the previous one, but it didn't last nearly as long. Rio pulled away, her vibrant green eyes sliding open to see the complete bliss that encompassed  every last inch of Agatha's expression.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hands were moving again, sliding over Agatha's shoulders to push the shirt over her them and down her arms. Agatha's compliance was immediate as she shed the article and tossed it aside, her hands resuming their position on Rio's hips, though there was no need for the security of the belt loops this time.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat in her wonder for a moment. Her eyes just traced, flittering over the scape of soft skin as it rolled down Agatha's neck to her shoulders, down her sternum and chest to be hidden beneath the lace that still clung there, snug in the hold of the clasp on her spine. That needed to go, first and foremost.
    </p>
<p>
     Head ducking again, Rio busied Agatha's lips with her own, teeth nipping and tongue curling against the flesh, then the calcium of teeth. Her hands made quick work and the clasp was released, the slack in the straps immediately apparent. Without removing the contact of the kiss, Rio's hands were moving once more, fingers hooking into the straps to pull them down enough that Agatha could remove her arms and it, too, could be discarded.
    </p>
<p>
     As the space reappeared between their lips once more, Rio sat back and instantly, an appreciative curling of her mouth happened in the blink of an eye as her gaze fell to drink in every bit of every curve of the body below her. A gentle press of her fingers to Agatha's shoulder indicated that she wanted her to lay back a little again and she was met with another show of compliance.
    </p>
<p>
     With Agatha angled back like that, it gave Rio easier and more comfortable access to all that she ached to touch. She could have been greedy, could have lifted both hands, but the moment called for more nuance, more care.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's left hand dropped to rest on the skin of Agatha's abdomen, though it was a little more positioned toward her side. Her right hand lifted and reached, palm flat against Agatha's chest. There, beneath the roughened skin, she could feel the steady rhythm of Agatha's heart as it beat in the prison of her ribs.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "This is home."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was a barely-there whisper into the night, a declaration of all that held true in the life of Rio Vidal.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would always love her daughter endlessly, and for years, wherever Rio and Estee were together had been home. Estee had grown, though, and she was branching off to live her own life, even if for the time being she was still close. Rio had worried what that would feel like, to be truly alone when the time came.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't have to be, because she had taken up residence in a new heart, in a new life.
    </p>
<p>
     She'd thought it more than once, but right then she
     <i>
      knew
     </i>
     it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha in her entirety was Rio's home.
    </p>
<p>
     The totality of the contact of palm to sternum lifted to just the gracing of fingertips as Rio began to surf the oceans of that warm skin, just dragging light lines across Agatha's chest, down to ride the wave that curved along once breast, then the other. Rio's opposite hand still lay idle in front of her, but the one she was using seemed to be enough. It was evident in the look on Agatha's face, the way her eyes were closed and she licked her lips. It was in the way her chin tipped just slightly in approval.
    </p>
<p>
     The touch skated up between her breasts and then back down, just barely nicking one of her erect nipples enough that a breath of a moan echoed around them. It had been almost too quiet, but it was the loudest thing Rio could hear.
    </p>
<p>
     Carefully, Rio pressed her idle hand down on Agatha's midsection to create enough leverage that she could scoot back toward Agatha's knees a bit more. Doing so seemed to lend to the ability to lean forward, tucking the tip of her nose beneath the corner of Agatha's jaw so that she could give a nudge, an indication that she wanted movement.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha obliged with a soft hum as her chin tipped back even further, her head tilting to the side so that Rio had access to more skin, more chances to ravish Agatha in every bit of her glory.
    </p>
<p>
     Each kiss was deliberate in its placement. Below her ear, down to the slight bulge of her SCM muscle as it protruded from the way Agatha's head was tilted. Lips pressed to the crook of her neck, her shoulder. Rio wound her way back to the center of Agatha's chest, head dropping to kiss down the path of one breast, the tip of her tongue brushing over the nipple that had not received any attention.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel in Agatha's posture that she was both about to come unhinged and also that she was soaking up every single bit of the attention Rio was paying to her body.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio only took this as encouragement. Her lips fastened over flesh, sucking the nipple into her mouth. Finally, her other hand raised to pay attention to the neglected side of her chest, palming that breast easily as her tongue made gentle work of toying with the skin in her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     These things together had Agatha squirming. It wasn't overt, wasn't like she was trying to get away. Instead, it was making her
     <i>
      feel
     </i>
     things. It was making her understand that Rio had meant it when she told her just what she was going to be doing with that time in that room. It was the realization that this was a very obvious display that while it was absolutely fun to fuck like rabbits anywhere and everywhere they could find a flat surface, what was happening right then was so much more.
    </p>
<p>
     It was appreciation. It was reverence. It was undying devotion.
    </p>
<p>
     At one point during Rio's work, Agatha's hand had landed on the back of her head, not moving much as she swapped out hand for mouth and mouth for hand, paying attention to the opposite side of Agatha's chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel every place beneath her own body where the tension was beginning to build in Agatha's muscles. She could feel the desperation for the exploration to continue, for Rio to keep going but perhaps at a slightly increased pace.
    </p>
<p>
     After another few moments of pushing and feeling the pressure building in Agatha rebuke, Rio's lips pulled from Agatha's breast in a way that caused a soft
     <i>
      pop
     </i>
     to sound as the vacuum she had created against Agatha's skin released. Before she could go far, Agatha's hold on the back of her head pushed her forward. It caused her hand to move, to brace herself as it planted next to Agatha's side on the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew what Agatha wanted, and this time Agatha took it by force.
    </p>
<p>
     The way Agatha pulled her in, the crashing of their lips collided in a way that was almost disorienting, but Rio had little time to think about it before Agatha was drowning her in a kiss that she didn't want to find air from. It filled Rio up in a way that, had she already not pooled so much of Agatha's love in her own being, it would have still caused her to overflow.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel Agatha's need, her cry for more, her absolute desperation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave it to her. She gave it to her in the cracking of teeth, in the pressing and wrestling of tongues. Rio delivered it straight to her in every moan that would seep into Agatha's lungs as it spilled out of Rio's throat.
    </p>
<p>
     When trying to pull back to return to her voyage through the ocean of Agatha's body, Rio was stopped by that firm hold on the back of her head. It had allowed just enough space for their lips to separate, but it provided little else.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Let me go, my love,"
     </i>
     Rio requested in a quiet whisper, one that was met with a whine of defiance. A small smirk found her lips just before they dusted a contact against Agatha's again.
     <i>
      "I promise it will be worth it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Another whine, but this one was in surrender as Agatha's fingers slid out from their hold in Rio's hair. The moment she was free from the restraint, Rio was moving again, back to placing kisses to Agatha's skin, but this time there was a straight path that wound down the very center of Agatha's torso. As Rio dove lower, scooting back to gain more ground, she even swiped mischievously with her tongue into Agatha's navel. In response, that hand was back in Rio's hair and a louder moan echoed off those walls.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Rio's lips met the waist of Agatha's dark brow trousers, her hands met her mouth and made quick work of undoing the fastens there. Agatha was squirming again, hips lifting and shifting in an attempt to hurry Rio along, but it wasn't working. Deliberately, she peeled back the loose corners of the fabric she had just released, revealing a show of lace that matched the recently discarded bra. Rio grinned at the sight and dropped her head, catching the material between her teeth so she could give it a tug.
    </p>
<p>
     Another moan produced itself that caused delight and thrill to curl through Rio's stomach, even more as Agatha's fingertips flexed against her scalp. The pace with which Rio was moving was doing what she intended, but she did not realized just how tightly she was actually winding Agatha up. Instead, fingers traced light lines along the waist of those trousers, finally tucking inside only once they reached her hip bones.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips stayed busy by kissing around and over the exposed lace, even as she maneuvered enough to begin the process of getting Agatha's pants down her legs. It took only a couple more moments of Rio kissing her way down the top of Agatha's leg as more and more skin was revealed until the point that the trousers were at Agatha's ankles. Finally, they were gone and on the floor a second later.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could have kept playing, could have toyed with her a little longer but she was of the belief that she'd drawn it on long enough to prove part of her point. Rio lifted herself up enough that she could reach up and hook the waist of those lace panties in order to slide them down smooth legs. They, too, landed soundlessly on the floor as well.
    </p>
<p>
     And there, as Rio sat perched at Agatha's feet, she saw her whole life, laid bare right before her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     A life that she loved endlessly. A life that she could so easily lose herself in the best way. A life of warmth, of acceptance, of never-ending love.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could have shoved the moment down the path it was headed down regardless, but she would have felt entirely remiss if she did not take the moment to voice what she was thinking.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I have waited every single second of every single minute of my life to love you the way I do in this moment."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Although Rio could locate every single spot that Agatha held the tension of how turned on she was, it was her face that told the true tale of all that Agatha was feeling as those words hit her ears. It fell, crumbling just slightly, the weight bearing down on her. It settled there for a moment, but then Agatha sat up and leaned toward Rio, a hand fastening around her neck to bring her closer.
    </p>
<p>
     Their lips met again, but this time, there was salt. Agatha was crying.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted the weight she had been supporting on both hands to only one so that she could reach up in an attempt to clear the tears, but it didn't really matter.
    </p>
<p>
     She let Agatha kiss her like that, more tears and desperation fueling her, driving Agatha forward. It lingered for just a couple of moments before Rio moved, eyes opening to reveal her request. The hand on Agatha's face landed on her chest and applied a gentle pressure.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Lay back, my love,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed at her in tender demand.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's beautiful blue eyes opened into Rio's, but she gave in and shifted so that she could place her head against the pillows, her body stretched out like the spread of a meal Rio had been starving for and she licked her lips hungrily in show of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Shifting again, Rio was able to crane over Agatha's body, once more showing attention to Agatha's abdomen by way of soft kisses that traveled down an already trekked path. The lower she kissed, the closer to the bed Rio's torso got. By the time her mouth had reached the light patch of hair between Agatha's legs, she was laying chest down on the bed, but Agatha's fingers twisted in her hair as she pulled Rio back up.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Nuhuh,"
     </i>
     Agatha whined softly.
     <i>
      "You're overdressed for this."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Shit. She was right.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been so focused on her task with honed interest that she had completely and entirely forgotten about her own clothes. There was a clear conflict in her face, having just reached what she was longing for and realizing she had to comply.
    </p>
<p>
     After a breath, Rio was moving in the blink of an eye, reaching down to nearly tear her shirt off, but Agatha's husky voice sounded again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "No. Slower."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     A chill shot straight up Rio's spine as she froze in place. Every muscle felt tense, every bit of heat causing a blush to wash over her skin beneath the fabric of her clothing. She listened, though, understanding why Agatha was asking.
    </p>
<p>
     Her arms crossed over her torso and pulled on the hem, taking her time in lifting it up, revealing an inch of skin at a time.  Agatha's expression screamed so impossibly loudly how much she was enjoying it, how much she was absorbing every delicious moment. Rio got it over her head and tossed it aside, her hand falling to her back instantly to un-do the clasp there. Feeding into Agatha's request, she slipped each strap down her arm, still keeping the bra pinned to her chest  until the very last moment as she pulled it away, too.
    </p>
<p>
     As hot as she was growing under Agatha's ravenous gaze, Rio was losing her patience. She was still slower than she would have otherwise been, but as she shifted to get her shorts off, she didn't hesitate to take the panties she had been wearing with them. She was back to her knees, towering over Agatha again, another view of all that she loved and held dear.
    </p>
<p>
     The smirk that wound up Agatha's lips felt like a hot ball of lead in the pit of Rio's stomach.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Much better,"
     </i>
     Agatha hummed in satisfaction.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio found her own smirk, her eyes casting down Agatha's body, hesitating on what she wanted most before they swept up again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "May I continue?"
     </i>
     Rio posed back with a raise of her eyebrow.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Please do."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could not fight the urge to roll her eyes as she lowered herself back to the top of the mattress, though her lips did not place themselves in the same spot they had previously left. Instead, her head turned to place a couple of kisses to the inside of Agatha's thigh, earning her both a soft moan and a hand once more in her hair. After a fourth kiss, though, Rio lost her hold for long enough to sink her teeth into the flesh she had just been kissing -- hard.
    </p>
<p>
     A surprised yelp hit the air around her and she released, but she'd accomplished what she needed to. That was going to leave a mark.
    </p>
<p>
     More kisses soothed the spot before they traveled and Rio finally had exactly what she wanted, in almost exactly the way she wanted it. With strong hands, she adjusted enough to grip Agatha's thighs, positioning her legs the way she needed them so that she could free her hands. Before she turned her attention fully to the task before her, she moved a little more. One hand found Agatha's on the bed, lacing their fingers together while the other reached up to pull Agatha's hold from her hair. Once their hands lowered, fingers threaded there, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she was satisfied, both of her hands nestled in Agatha's grip, Rio's head dropped. Her lips pressed to the crease where supple flesh met the inner curve of her thigh, kissing, tracing the tip of her tongue along it. Equal attention was paid to the other side. And then, open there before her, Rio's mouth met Agatha's hot and wet core in a move that garnered an entire death grip on both of her hands, as well as a raise of hips that Rio was almost certain was involuntary. She didn't care, it just gave her more of Agatha's body to devour for just a brief second.
    </p>
<p>
     There was an urge inside of Rio to hook her hands around Agatha's hips, but she fought it and simply tightened her grip on Agatha's fingers, using it to pull herself forward even a fraction of her inch. The tiniest bit of leverage gave her a slightly better angle as her tongue worked in slow, deliberate strokes. It alternated between an intentional build of pressure and a wandering show of appreciation, of wanting to get what she could.
    </p>
<p>
     Every move Rio made, both with her mouth and with her hands locked into Agatha's was something calculated, something that was meant to push buttons. She was tying them down, keeping them bound in a way that she wanted Agatha to focus solely on what it felt like when Rio consumed her whole, tasting and touching every bit of her she could get to.
    </p>
<p>
     The longer it drew on, the more restless she could feel Agatha becoming. Every few minutes, Agatha would try to pull her hands away but Rio clung to them, humming her disapproval against Agatha's core, sometimes her clit, which caused the most pained and desperate moan to hit her ears every single time.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Rio's lips pursed and sucked on that small bundle of nerves, she could feel as Agatha's thighs tightened the slightest bit, skin pressing to one of Rio's ears in a move that encouraged her to keep going, but not before asserting that she had something to say.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips released, but her breath was just as hot as Agatha's wetness as she found her voice.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come for me, my love,"
     </i>
     she requested, her eyes cutting up to where Agatha was watching her breathlessly.
    </p>
<p>
     Not another second passed before Rio resumed her work, more tongue than lips to the most sensitive part of Agatha's body. The attention was working and it showed in the way that Agatha was gripping her hands so tightly that every single spot her fingers sank into turned Rio's skin a blinding white color.
    </p>
<p>
     It took only another moment before Rio was able to sense it coming. Agatha's back arched, her hips struggling to not lift higher. With one last flick of the tip of Rio's tongue, it happened in a flash.
    </p>
<p>
     The rumbling started in Agatha's chest, but by the time it reached her lips in an impossibly loud moan, her legs had tightened around Rio's head, but it didn't compel her to stop. She pushed on instead, not slowing her motion or stopping the attention she was paying to what she was doing. Agatha could have cracked her head like a damn watermelon in that moment and it still wouldn't have made her stop.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tried again to jerk her hands away, surely to push Rio away, but Rio held on.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, for the briefest moment, she felt something different.
    </p>
<p>
     She felt a tensing that was not usually attributed to an orgasm and immediately let go, desisting the overtime her mouth had been pulling. After a few more seconds, Agatha's thighs relaxed, though she was still breathing heavily with her head tipped toward the ceiling.
    </p>
<p>
     Nothing about that fleeting second was written on Agatha's face, or in her posture now, but Rio had still felt it.
    </p>
<p>
     She was torn for a moment on whether or not to bring it up, but the moment Agatha's eyes opened and she looked down the expanse of her body to Rio there between her legs, Rio could see that whatever it was had disappeared and it could, instead, be a conversation for another day.
    </p>
<p>
     Focusing on that moment right then and there, Rio pushed herself up to all fours and moved forward, crawling over Agatha to lower her weight onto her form there below her. She tucked her head to lay on Agatha's chest, placing her ear over that wildly beating heart in her chest. Agatha's arms wrapped around her instantly, holding her close.
    </p>
<p>
     It was still sitting right there, that memory of the unfamiliar. She wanted to say something, wanted to ask if everything was okay, but Rio was too afraid of breaking the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     It took a couple of minutes for Agatha to gather herself, but when she did Rio was made aware by the light shapes she felt being traced on her back. They simply laid like that for what could have been a half an hour and Rio wouldn't have known. She was just content, listening to the sound of a heart that loved her infinitely as it thudded inside of the woman she would spend all of her days with.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha finally moved, lifting her head from the pillow to kiss the top of Rio's head, murmuring softly into her hair.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Do you know what I want?"
     </i>
     she inquired.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted her head, their gazes falling into one another.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Tell me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "I want a similar view to the one you got, but I like it more when you're the one in control,"
     </i>
     she informed Rio, her tone low and sultry.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Is that your really sweet way of telling me you want me to ride your face?"
     </i>
     Rio questioned back, though her delectable giggle sounded not a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "If it is, are you gonna say yes?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Instead of verbalizing an answer, Rio leaned up enough to kiss Agatha hungrily, though that lingering tenderness was still apparent.
    </p>
<p>
     It took little time for Agatha to prove how dire her need was. Hands were moving, grabbing, gripping and pulling in every which way they could. It had taken her a sizeable amount of time to cover the skin she was so desperate feel, every inch of it that she could reach and Rio simply let her. She let herself feel ravished by this incredible human being she got to call hers, because it was all she had wanted in her life. Someone to show her just how godly they thought her to be.
    </p>
<p>
     As she sensed that Agatha was done exploring by the way she tore their lips apart, Rio lifted herself only slightly to look down into those eyes she loved so very much and what she was met with was both overwhelming affection and also the pained hunger of wanting to be close.
    </p>
<p>
     This was her cue.
    </p>
<p>
     She removed her body from Agatha's, not surprised by the way Agatha shifted to get more comfortable. The way she held herself, straddling Agatha's hips, allotted for enough room that Agatha was able to take her in the same way Rio had consumed her, too. Agatha was so enamored, and it was so clearly written in every micro-expression she had. It was in the tiniest twitch at the corner of her mouth, in the slightest pinch of her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha loved her in the exact same way that she loved Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She could literally
     <i>
      feel
     </i>
     it in her gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression shifted, though, and it was clear she was suddenly growing impatient.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come,"
     </i>
     she requested. The lone word made a shiver spike up Rio's spine, but she listened nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
     With care, Rio moved to position herself with her knees on either side of Agatha's head in a way that left her calves pressed to the sides of Agatha's body where her shoulders were. Agatha's hands were almost instantly on her hips, though her grip was not rough or needy. It was firm, but only in a way that offered direction, especially as she tugged downward.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio felt the kisses on her thighs, the tracing of Agatha's tongue on every single spot but the one Rio was aching for, she stifled a whimper to try and let Agatha have her fun after she'd had her own. She could feel every single spot that Agatha graced with her lips, that she tested with her tongue. With another gentle pull, she felt the warmth between her legs as it came into full contact with Agatha's lips and tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     It took a show of willpower to not rock down into the feeling, but this was a game they played every single time they did this dance. She did sink, the slightest bit, but only because the muscles in her legs were straining.
    </p>
<p>
     She let it take her over, the attention Agatha was being generous in dealing out. It was when Agatha's hands left her hips and began to roam that stirred something carnal within her. She did not resist, did not grow frenzied, but the way Agatha's palms canvassed what skin they could reach until they could take hold of Rio's breasts made her feel like she was going to dissolve right there atop her fiancée. She tried to fight it, but the desperation won out and Rio's hips worked down, quickly finding a rhythm against Agatha's mouth and the tip of her nose as it brushed against her clit.
    </p>
<p>
     One of her hands snapped to the top of Agatha's head, tangling in what hair she could grasp as her movements became more frantic. Agatha's touch lifted from her chest but then fell to both sides of her ass, fingers sinking into the flesh in a desperate and rough way. Agatha was pulling her down, harder and with more force than Rio had known her capable of, but she didn't care. It meant that more of her felt the warmth of Agatha's mouth, felt the tease of Agatha's tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hips shifted in a manner caused her to rock forward, the hand that wasn't in Agatha's hair flying up to grip at the headboard of the bed. She was
     <i>
      so
     </i>
     close and yet she was fighting to hold on, to make it last just a little longer.
    </p>
<p>
     The second Agatha's fingers sunk so hard into the flesh and muscle of her ass that she immediately was aware it would bruise, Rio felt it all at once.
    </p>
<p>
     Her body tensed for only a moment and then the trembling took over. Her breath had stopped in time with the beating of her heart before everything kicked back into action and her body seemed to recall what it took to function.
    </p>
<p>
     What had started as a moan instead shifted into a cry of nothing more than sheer pleasure. It was loud, it was high pitched and it was absolutely the most beautiful sound Agatha had ever heard, judging by the look on her face when Rio found it in herself to open her eyes. She couldn't see the lower half of Agatha's expression from where she was sat, but she could tell by the wrinkles at the corners of her eyes that she was grinning.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You look like you won the lottery,"
     </i>
     Rio cooed as she found the strength to start moving, though she resumed her earlier position with her body covering Agatha's like she was some sort of weighted blanket, though this time she tucked her face into Agatha's neck and simply breathed in the mixture of sex, sweat and perfume as they all entwined together.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Not even the lottery could make me as rich as I am when I have you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio managed the breathiest giggle, nuzzling further into the skin she belonged in.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're such a romantic,"
     </i>
     Rio accused in a whisper, fighting another giggle.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Maybe,"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured, fingertips tracing light lines up and down Rio's back.
     <i>
      "But I'd consider it as just wanting to bring out the best in you. And that... that was
      <b>
       the
      </b>
      best."

<p>
     Before Agatha had leaned over to shut off the light that sat atop the nightstand on her side of the bed, Rio had been convinced that she was only moments away from passing out. That feeling almost intensified the moment Agatha had curled into her side, her head laying on Rio's chest with ease.
    </p>
<p>
     So then, to be laying there nearly an hour later staring at the ceiling with a snoring Agatha on her chest, their skin pressed together everywhere on her side all the way down to where Agatha had her leg hooked over Rio's own, Rio was annoyed.
    </p>
<p>
     Being in that room again was something that Rio had thought could bring her more peace in the form of revisiting who she used to be, who she had been when she had walked into that hotel the first time. She had not been entirely wrong, but something was keeping her up. For the first half an hour, she didn't even know what it was.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, she remembered.
    </p>
<p>
     There was one moment. It was almost there and gone in the matter of a blink of her eyes. It had happened so fast that Rio actually questioned the reality of it. But it had, she knew it had.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been in the way Agatha's arms had pulled taut in her attempt to unlock from Rio's grasp, her fingers releasing their hold in an effort to regain her faculties, but Rio had held on for that second too long.
    </p>
<p>
     It shouldn't have been bothering her. It clearly had not affected Agatha enough for it to show past that one spike of a moment that was now living rent free in Rio's mind. So then what about it was literally keeping her awake?
    </p>
<p>
     The longer she laid there, green eyes locked onto one specific spot on the ceiling, she began to question herself. She was making a big deal in her own mind over nothing... right? It had been literally miniscule in the grand scheme of their night together. It had been a glitch, just a hiccup in time that displaced rationale.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite trying to talk herself down, letting it go seemed impossible.
    </p>
<p>
     It made Rio feel insane. It made her feel like she was fixating, like she was obsessing over something that hadn't deserved a second thought. That war raged within her, back and forth on trying to let it go and finding herself unable to. She was fighting to put it to bed, to try and let her mind rest long enough to sleep. After two hours, she knew it wasn't a battle she was going to win.
    </p>
<p>
     Very slowly and very carefully, Rio managed to slide out from Agatha in a way that allowed her to pull a pillow down just enough for Agatha's cheek to land against it. Agatha shifted only slightly to tuck a hand beneath that cheek, but otherwise she stayed asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's footsteps were quiet as they padded toward the bathroom to slide one of the robes off of the hanger it was on and pulled it onto her lithe frame. As she made her way toward the balcony, she paused for just a moment as her eyes cast toward her fiancée on that bed, half wrapped in sheet and half naked but fully bathed in moonlight. It made Rio's breath catch in her chest for just a split second in a way that often happened when she caught Agatha in the quieter moments.
    </p>
<p>
     She made a valiant attempt at being as soundless as possible as she slid the glass door to the side enough that she could slip outside. Though she pulled it shut, she didn't close it entirely and left about a four inch gap of open space so that she could hear if anything happened inside or Agatha tried to call for her. It was a silly thought; they were perfectly safe in that hotel room, but there was something undeniable about the fact that Rio simply felt unsettled.
    </p>
<p>
     Again, the sense there was completely gone. There was absolutely no reason in the world for her to have been concerned but it was like a gnat that she couldn't get rid of. It would disappear for a few minutes at a time as her eyes cast out on the vast expanse of the LA skyline and then the peace was gone and it was right in her peripherals, grating on her nerves.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a cycle repeating for far longer than she had intended it to. It had worn on for so long, in fact, that she had simply not considered that her absence might be noticed. Not until the sound of the door sliding open alerted her to the fact that Agatha was awake.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward in her chair as she twisted her torso around enough to see the woman she loved in the doorway, clutching a sheet to her chest as it was draped around her and dragging on the floor.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Baby? What are you doing out here?"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured softly and something in Rio's chest squeezed based on the conversation they'd had earlier that night.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I can't sleep. But you should, my love. I'll... be back in soon."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could almost hear it, the way her answer seemed to wake Agatha up, the way it caused her posture to shift and stiffen slightly. It clearly was not a response she was satisfied with.
    </p>
<p>
     Still dragging that sheet, Agatha made her way out onto the balcony and shut the door behind her. She stood for a moment in indecision as her eyes landed on the extra chair and then on Rio. It was a repeated process the next second but she made her choice and placed herself in Rio's lap, leaning into her the moment Rio's hands lifted to hold her firm where she sat.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Are you okay?"
     </i>
     Agatha asked her softly, her face pressing into the side of Rio's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took a slow breath in an attempt to tame the way her heart began to drum in her chest. How did she answer that? She was fine. That wasn't the question here. She let a thick moment of silence sit there with them, only disturbed by the sounds of the city around them. Then, she managed to ask her question.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I am, but... Are you?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could feel it, everywhere on her neck where Agatha's expression pulled tight. She stayed still like that for a long moment but then Rio could feel as she started to shift, lifting her head so that she could look down at Rio, so that she could look her in the eye. The confusion was written cleanly on her face but she was looking for more, looking for an explanation.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Why are you asking that?"
     </i>
     Agatha whispered and though Rio would never have called it out, she could almost hear the sting of apprehension as it snuck into her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Rio wasn't crazy after all.
    </p>
<p>
     Her gaze was careful in its inspection as it searched over Agatha's features, trying to uncover the best way to go about this. She knew that voicing it was going to make her sound crazier than she had felt simply thinking it, but... She loved Agatha, and Agatha loved her. If she'd made a mistake or a wrong assumption, she would own up to it and apologize. If there was any chance there was something else there? Rio had to know.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Because I... You did something earlier. I don't even know if you know you did it. But... When I didn't let go of your hands, you tensed, but it wasn't because you were coming... And I... It felt like panic, even if it went away almost instantly."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had felt, almost mid explanation, as Agatha practically froze in her lap. She didn't hear her breathing, didn't see her chest moving, and that look in her eyes as Rio glanced up to her? She looked like a deer caught in the headlights, like she was completely blindsided by the turn this conversation had taken.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips turned down at the corners and she released her hold on Agatha with one hand to reach up, brushing Agatha's cheek with the backs of her knuckles.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You can tell me, Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio whispered to her, hand shifting to cradle her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's jaw would tighten then release in time with the way her throat would bob like she wanted to say something but was close to choking on the words. Rio had not been so accustomed to seeing Agatha lose her wits as she had come to be in the passing weeks. Agatha was not an overtly emotional person, even if Rio knew that she'd gotten to see more of Agatha than anyone else ever would. The point still stood that Agatha ran a tight ship when it came to keeping her emotions in check the majority of the time, but this... This was beyond even what Rio had been privy to up to that point.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips were pressed thin with something Rio did not realized had been so repressed that even Agatha had forgotten about it until the exact moment something happened that was vivid enough to remind her.
    </p>
<p>
     As she began to speak, the sound of her voice absolutely crushed something in Rio that had been holding onto the blind hope that while Agatha's roots had been traumatic and hard, what she knew was all that there was to know. It was a low sound, a whisper but it was pained in away Rio had never heard out of Agatha before.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "When I was a child... I was... wild. I had a lot of energy and I also had a lot of disrespect toward a woman who hated me for reasons I was too young to understand. There were times... She would try to yell enough to scare me into settling down but it almost never worked."
     </i>
     Agatha's eyes slid shut and a single tear rolled down her right cheek. Part of Rio wanted to brush it away but she did not want to shatter the absolutely fragile moment between them.
     <i>
      "When it didn't... She would... restrain me. Most of the time to chairs. She would make me sit like that for hours, laughing when I would wet my pants. I... I was too scared to tell anyone. It took years for me to get big enough to fight back, but I did."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes were still closed but she drew in a slow, steadying breath.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's a sob story. It's one that I threw in the deepest lakes of my brain and forgot about. But... when I couldn't move in that moment, I panicked for literally a second but then realized why it happened. By then, you had already let go. You... knew... You knew without having to be told."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Slowly, those blue eyes opened in the light of the moon and Rio realized that a couple of tears had slipped down her own cheeks at this revelation.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's just not something I ever thought I'd revisit in my life. It's not something I purposely avoided. But I... I'm sorry this is how I'm telling you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     In an instant, Rio was sitting up, reaching for Agatha's face with one hand, pulling her close enough that Rio could kiss her softly, her caress gentle on Agatha's cheek.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Please, my love, do not apologize," Rio pressed in a quiet whisper. "I love you for
      <b>
       everything
      </b>
      you are, including your trauma. It doesn't change my feelings for you. It makes me want to love you harder, to kiss the ache out of you. It makes me want to remind you with every touch that you're in gentle hands for as long as you let me love you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's head tipped forward, their foreheads pressing in contact as Agatha exhaled a slow sigh.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I will never know what I did in this universe to deserve your love,"
     </i>
     Agatha admitted, but Rio was quick to prevent her from continuing by stealing another tender kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Does it matter more than knowing you have it unyieldingly?"
     </i>
     Rio managed back against Agatha's lips, her breath warm.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I suppose it does not."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The two of them had sat outside for a little while longer but finally decided to go back in some time around 5 am at Agatha's soft behest as it was breathed against Rio's neck. That vision of Agatha walking in ahead of her, still dragging that sheet with her hair cascading down her bare back caused Rio's lips to curl into a loving smile.
    </p>
<p>
     This woman who had been so fucking broken throughout her life had overcome so much, had taken complete control of her own life. She had never taken 'no' for an answer and she pushed through every obstacle that was put in her way.  Agatha had completely flattened anyone or anything that tried to stop get from getting whatever it was she wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     Although Rio was of the complete understanding that what had happened was not her fault, there was still something in her chest that felt a little cracked at being the reason they'd needed to have that conversation.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was a complex person, that was something Rio had known from the day they met. What Rio never could have known was just how good Agatha was at using her life experience to defy any opposition she might face. She had suffered as a child, a teenager and she had grown into an adult that had made her own misery. It had taken her so very long to get to a point where she had started to love herself in regard to just more than the work she was capable of producing, but Rio had watched it as it happened and it was a beautiful thing to behold.
    </p>
<p>
     Watching Agatha crawl into that bed, looking back over her shoulder at Rio that way as she asked to be the little spoon this time, Rio felt herself melt yet again at the warmth that came with the realization of just how lucky she was to be the one that got to be the big spoon.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, wrapped around Agatha, Rio was able to find sleep a bit easier. There was no longer doubt and questioning circling through her head. The realization that she had done what she needed to in listening to what Agatha had to say and understanding what her actions had done unintentionally made Rio realize that this was what it truly was to love someone unconditionally.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could have looked Rio in the eyes and told her that she had killed someone and Rio's first response likely would have been to ask why.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't that Agatha could do no wrong. There would surely be choices that Agatha would make that were bad, but the same could have been said for Rio herself. It was that when Agatha made a decision, she always had a reason. Agatha was not a senseless and baseless type of person; that was something Rio was absolutely certain of. Nearly everything Agatha chose to do was intentional and there was rationale to back it up.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha made a statement, she did so with her shoulders squared and her chest out.
    </p>
<p>
     That fact was what made Rio realize just how privileged to be the one to see Agatha in those more vulnerable moments. A woman who had staved off the world with her emotional guard had decided to finally let someone in. Out of context, admitting that it was a woman who had flown over an ocean to track her down with little to go on other than her name and an office address would have, as always seemed insane.
    </p>
<p>
     Between the two of them when they had been locked away like they were in that hotel room but in those first days, it had been the first chapter of their story. It was the opening scene to the movie of their lives.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio awoke the next morning, it was to the soft sound of Agatha's voice saying her name and a light touch on her leg, giving it a gentle shake.
    </p>
<p>
     "Baby, we have to check out in twenty minutes," Agatha informed her, pulling her shirt over her head.
    </p>
<p>
     This drew a terribly long and terribly low groan of protest. If check-out was at 10 or 11, that meant they'd gotten five hours of sleep at the most. Rio was not having any of it. She rolled onto her stomach and nuzzled her face into the pillow.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agathaaaa,"
     </i>
     she whined softly, slapping a hand on the mattress as she flexed her fingers in a grabbing motion, as if trying to compel Agatha to climb back into bed with her.
    </p>
<p>
     "My love," Agatha chastised, but she heeded Rio's request after she finished sliding her pants back on. She picked up her hand and slid onto the bed, moving to hold it in her lap. "We need to leave soon."
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mmmmhm, I heard you the first time,"
     </i>
     Rio grumbled but not a moment later, she had an idea. She gave Agatha's hand a gentle squeeze and opened one eye to peer at her, half of a smile visible on her face.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "One more night."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She could hear the resigned sigh the moment it left Agatha's lips which then pulled up in a sweet smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "Only because we have nothing to do today and you know I cannot tell you no and mean it."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a half-asleep squeal in response, gripping Agatha's hand a little harder as that smile on Rio's face morphed into a grin. Agatha played with Rio's fingers for a moment before she looked back down at Rio there, face half buried in the pillow with her bare body basking in the morning sun.
    </p>
<p>
     "But, since I am now dressed, I'm going to run back to the house and grab us some clothes. Do you want me to grab your face wash too?" she posed and Rio could have sunk right into that mattress with how quickly she dissolved. It was so innocent, but it was so thoughtful at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "That would be nice,"
     </i>
     Rio hummed in soft response.
     <i>
      "And it would be really nice if you brought us some of those crazy-style French fries."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's laughter was almost instant and she gripped Rio's hand affectionately in both of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, my love, I will bring us some animal-style fries. Do you want a cheeseburger, too, or just the fries?" Rio could hear the grin in Agatha's voice without having to look at her face.
    </p>
<p>
     These were the moments, the tender little silly ones that would be so insignificant if not for the fact that they got locked away to memory by both of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio calling something by the wrong name because she was still learning about it and Agatha completely softening over the genuineness of the effort.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Just the fries."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted one of her hands to trace along the protrusions of Rio's carpals in her hand, a soft chuckle passing through her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's it?" Agatha offered, her smile growing at what Rio's response would be to her next words. "No strawberry milkshake?"
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mmm! Yes! Strawberry milkshake too, please."
     </i>
     Rio's eye flickered open again, sweeping up to Agatha.
     <i>
      "Sometimes I think you know me better than I know myself."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     "You know what?" Agatha posed, lifting Rio's hand to press her lips to the back of it. "I think I do too."
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha mentioned that she had about eight minutes to get down to the front desk to renew their booking, Rio had shifted so that she could sit up to give her a proper goodbye.
    </p>
<p>
     There was something a little... raw about those few moments as a naked Rio clung to her lover until Agatha kissed the side of her head and insisted she really did have to go. Rio knew it, she was just still a little sleepy and as a result, an unusual clinginess had taken her over. She'd tilted her head up, lips puckering playfully indicating what she wanted and Agatha gave it to her in the form of a soft kiss as she leaned over the bed, having already gotten to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     "Go back to sleep, sweetheart. I'll be back in a little bit." Agatha ran a light fingertip along the under side of Rio's chin, grinning as the touch retracted and she headed for the door. She pulled it open but turned around to say the one thing she would always make sure she said any time they parted.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, Rio."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hummed in her delight at hearing it, something that never changed or got old.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you too, Agatha. Be safe."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The door clicked shut and it had taken Rio all of fifteen minutes to fall asleep in the warm sheets that smelled like Agatha. Her perfume, her sweat, her sex. It wasn't having her physically there, but it was enough of her that it could still offer comfort.
    </p>
<p>
     When she awoke to the feeling of lips pressed to her shoulder, she had absolutely no clue how long she'd been out. As she began to reattach to the conscious plane, Rios face lifted out of the pillow to turn slightly, lending her the ability to see Agatha out of the corner of her eye.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Back already?"
     </i>
     Rio questioned in a quiet murmur.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Baby, it's been four hours,"
     </i>
     Agatha offered, a soft laugh passing through her lips against the bare skin of Rio's back.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's three in the afternoon?!"
     </i>
     Rio managed shrilly, carefully pushing herself up just enough that she could roll over to her back, able to see Agatha fully as she sat next to Rio on the bed, one arm extended to support her weight.
    </p>
<p>
     The grin she was wearing was often her best accessory.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised her hands and balled them into fists, rubbing at her eyes in an attempt to chase the sleep away. As she lowered them, her gaze fell back to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, how's it that it took you four hours to grab clothes, hm?" Rio posed playfully, the grogginess still heavy in her expression though it ebbed at the smile on her lips the slightest bit.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well..." Agatha began, her expression the slightest bit sheepish. "I was at the house and got a text from Dave that the tasting sampler for the cake was ready and that it could be picked up today. He offered to grab it and bring it but when I called you and you didn't answer because your phone is almost
     <i>
      always
     </i>
     on vibrate anymore I figured I had some time. So I had him meet me and we grabbed a cup of coffee."
    </p>
<p>
     This revelation made Rio grin for a few reasons. Firstly, getting the cake sampler early meant that, if they wanted to, they could go home tomorrow instead of the day after. It might even be nice to surprise the kids, really. Second, the fact that Agatha had started spending more time with Dave really touched Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew how Dave felt about Agatha and she knew that for a very long time, Agatha had kept their relationship to a working one and that seemed to suit them both just fine. Knowing that she was recognizing his loyalty for what it was and accepting his friendship after so long keeping things professional caused Rio to feel a deep affection for the man.
    </p>
<p>
     Dave was a good man. Dave had been the glue that held Agatha's life together until he passed the torch onto Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     It might have seemed like a chore, but Rio thought herself honored to be the one with that responsibility.
    </p>
<p>
     "But you got the sampler?" Rio posed, dropping a hand down to land on Agatha's knee.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted forward and scooped the box off of the nightstand, a proud grin on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "What better place to try cake for our wedding than the place we learned so much about each other?" It was a true sentiment, but Rio was grinning for an entirely different reason.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "There is that absolutely undeniable romanticism again,"
     </i>
     Rio teased, earning her a narrowing of Agatha's eyes, but her lips split in a bright smile not a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... Are you just going to stay naked for it? If the answer is yes, I promise to lick icing off your stomach," Agatha managed somehow through that mischievous smirk that wound its way across her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Then why would the answer
     <i>
      ever
     </i>
     be no?"
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     They had sat in that hotel room for the next hour tasting and trying the different cakes they had been provided and weighing the pros and cons of each one. Ultimately, they had both agreed that the red velvet paired with the almond butter creme icing had come out victorious. Each sample had been incredible and Rio had honestly never known that cake could taste that good, but it had been pretty clear almost immediately that they both had a favorite.
    </p>
<p>
     Because she had returned with cake and not actual food, Agatha had convinced -- more like looked toward the bathroom not even in suggestion -- Rio to take a shower with her and get dressed so they could venture out for a little while to find a meal.
    </p>
<p>
     They had been about to walk out the door but as Rio slid in a pair of earrings, her eyes lifted to Agatha who was spritzing herself with her perfume.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you know what myth I have always heard but have never seen nor experienced in my whole time in America?" Rio posed, as if that 'whole time' was more than a couple of weeks.
    </p>
<p>
     "What's that, my love?" Agatha had posed, setting down the bottle of perfume as her attention turned to Rio and she rolled up the sleeves of her blouse in a way that caused a light flicker of heat to bloom in Rio's middle. She ignored it, though, looking back into Agatha's eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "A taco truck."
    </p>
<p>
     "We can absolutely find you one of the best ones in the city, if that's what you're hungry for," Agatha assured her, her eyes bright with just how tickled she was that Rio had suggested such a thing.
    </p>
<p>
     So, they headed into the evening and Rio got her street tacos that she spent the rest of the night randomly raving about and insisting it was something they needed back in Auckland. Agatha would smile every time, never once getting tired of the randomness which it would surface.
    </p>
<p>
     Returning to the hotel had been bittersweet. Rio knew when they woke up, they
     <i>
      would
     </i>
     have to leave. They would likely go home, though it wasn't a conversation they'd had yet. Getting one more night there, hidden away from the rest of the world, that was one last dose of nostalgic bliss.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio had been able to somehow be discreet about throughout the day since she had woken up was that she had been texting Estee and while that was not normally something that would have been suspicious, it was the content of their conversation that left Rio in a constant battle to keep her expression smooth and placid enough to not flag Agatha's attention.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee and Tay were doing Rio a favor. They were driving through the city, popping into higher end jewelers and sending Rio photos of the three rings they liked at each location. They'd been to three throughout the day and had declared they had reached their final stop not moments before Rio saw it.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a gold band and in the very center sat the most breathtaking diamond, but it was amethyst in color despite every other characteristic it had indicating that it was a diamond. It was tear-drop shaped and at the point, there was the smallest pearl. It was set in a cradle of a variety different shaped and sized diamonds, including three evenly sized ones at the bottom that formed a small triangle. That small detail almost gave Rio away as she surveyed the photo.
    </p>
<p>
     Their love was the rock and the triad beneath them symbolized their children.
    </p>
<p>
     On either side of the triangle, two pearls sat, almost double the size of the tiny one at the top of the diamond. It was an incredible piece of work, and it was one Rio knew without a single doubt that she wanted to see on her future wife's finger every single day for the rest of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had wired the money to Estee immediately and told her to purchase it.
    </p>
<p>
     Ten minutes later, she got a text that read nothing but: "Bag secured." The emoji wearing the ninja outfit added a classic Estee touch.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was able to put her phone away after that, turning to the rest of their evening with Agatha. They'd put on a movie, made out for a little bit, and after they'd all but abandoned the film, Agatha wickedly informed her that clothes were not the only thing she grabbed when she'd gone home.
    </p>
<p>
     That had turned Rio about six shades of red, but more out of excitement than anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     And so, they had spent their last night in that hotel room absolutely fucking like feral teenagers. It had been hot, it had been raw and primal in a way that gave Rio such a rush, a coursing of excitement that lasted for the hours they tangled and kissed and licked and sucked. It was hips slamming into hips, hands grabbing every single spot they could hold onto.
    </p>
<p>
     What it had really been was yet another display of how much they loved each other. It was a showing of their ability to completely ravish one another, to get so entirely lost in the physical closeness that came with being so intimate.
    </p>
<p>
     They had fallen asleep much earlier that night, but only after Agatha had booked them a flight out the next evening that left at five. They had both decided to not disclose their early arrival to the children, as Rio had hoped they might, wanting to surprise them with an early return.
    </p>
<p>
     The next morning, they'd gotten up early enough to check out and had grabbed breakfast at an adorable little diner. Mid-meal, Agatha had stated that she needed to stop by her office before they left to grab a few things she wanted to take back with her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew the moment she said it that it was a ploy, but she went along with it.
    </p>
<p>
     She also went along with the office sex that Agatha had not hesitated to initiate with a request that they be much quieter since the office
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     full that time. At one point, as Rio was bent over Agatha's desk and Agatha was completely taking her from behind while also pinning Rio to the cool wood with her hand on her back, someone had knocked.
    </p>
<p>
     The sound of Agatha's voice as she had screeched a NOT NOW had almost ripped Rio from the moment and sent her into a fit of laughter, but Agatha cut that off immediately by sinking a third finger inside of her. That had Rio biting her own arm to stifle the sound that was begging to escape her.
    </p>
<p>
     For them, the office had been a quickie, but it had thoroughly exhausted Rio by the time they poured into their seats on that plane. It had taken each of them less than an hour to fall asleep. Neither of them stayed that way the whole flight, but they'd cut off a large chunk of the wait in their slumber.
    </p>
<p>
     As they walked up their drive, hand in hand, they were each donning grins that were obvious displays of how excited they were to be home, to be back with their children. Although it wasn't intentional, little noise was made as Agatha unlocked the door and pushed it open.
    </p>
<p>
     From where they stood in the doorway as they pushed their small suitcases to the side, Rio could tell that the television was on in the living room but there were no other noises to indicate who might have been occupying the space.
    </p>
<p>
     They stepped further into the home on quiet feet after having removed their shoes and were met with the backs of two heads over the top of the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     It was not Estee and Tay.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grin filled her face in an instant and it was positively devious. She let go of Rio's hand and strode over, scaring the life out of the two men as she came around the side of the couch and placed herself directly next to Nicky, her palms slapping to the tops of her thighs in excitement and also perhaps a dash of mischief.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good evening, boys!" she chirped at them.
    </p>
<p>
     In moments like that, Rio could only beam with how in love she was with that woman.
    </p>

       All I ever needed was you to believe in me
       <br/>
       *****
      </i>
</p>
</center>
<p>
     For just a moment, Rio simply stood back to behold the scene before her.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't need to see Nicky's face to realize that the second his mother placed herself on the couch next to him, he had turned at least twelve different shades of red. While Rio and Agatha had wanted it to be a surprise that they got to come home sooner, they definitely had not expected to stumble upon a pot of gold upon their return.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could almost see the way Agatha was buzzing. It wasn't even that she'd out-maneuvered Nicky. In fact, Rio was pretty sure the last thing Agatha was thinking about was the conversation they'd had with the girls that had left her confidence a little dinged. What Agatha was seeing in that moment was that her son had found someone he liked spending time with, maybe even someone he had started to care for. What Agatha was seeing was that there was a young man sitting right there who looked at her son and could see any flicker of a future with him.
    </p>
<p>
     Surely, that future had included meeting Agatha a lot further down the line, but that didn't match the brand of chaos that went on in the Harkness-Vidal household, now did it?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched as the man on the other side of Nicky sat up a little bit and turned toward Agatha. She could see other movement, but could not see the way Hēmi extended his hand to Agatha who took it and gave it a light shake, even though she knew it was happening.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's a pleasure to meet you, Ms. Harkness. I'm Hēmi. I've heard so much about you."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was fucking beaming. Rio had seen her be giddy over things before, but this was on another level entirely. There were enough lights in her eyes that LA at night would have been put to shame. That smile could have given the sun a run for its money.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was just...
     <i>
      happy.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That wasn't to say that she wasn't happy around Rio, because
     <i>
      everyone
     </i>
     was well aware that she was, but this was a different strain of happiness. This was a different expression of joy that could only have ever surfaced in regards to her son.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha still thought in the darker moments that she had damaged Nicky in ways that not only would he never forgive her for, but that he might never recover from. She still worried that even though she had tried her hardest to repair what she had broken between them, it might taint whatever they could build.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, none of that touched Agatha's expression. There was just thrill and excitement in every single muscle. There was just utter anticipation as to how this might unfold.
    </p>
<p>
     "Please, you can call me Agatha."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had realized, despite his embarrassment, that something was slightly off. As he went to question it, Hēmi was actually the one who turned to look behind him.
    </p>
<p>
     He was speaking, but the moment Rio saw his face, she wasn't really listening.
    </p>
<p>
     "And it's nice to meet you as well, Ms. Vidal. Nicky has a lot of good things to say about you too."
    </p>
<p>
     It was a sweet introduction, sure, but it was not what was keeping Rio quiet.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's complete control over her own cognition had slipped. She was
     <i>
      starstruck.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That was quite a hilarious thought given who she was engaged to, but there had always been something a little off-kilter about the things Rio valued in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     The fact that she was staring at the face of a Prop on the All Blacks had her feeling like she was about to faint.
    </p>
<p>
     At the prolonged silence, Agatha too turned to look at her, followed a moment later by Nicky. All three of them, heads over the back of the couch, were just staring at her. Rio knew she needed to talk, needed to say something --
     <i>
      anything
     </i>
     -- but the words simply would not produce themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     Surely this was something the two men had discussed between themselves, and Nicky
     <i>
      knew
     </i>
     how Rio felt about the All Blacks.
    </p>
<p>
     This was evident the moment she found herself able to shift her gaze and it landed on him. The grin he was wearing was ridiculous. He knew exactly what was happening and he knew that Rio was probably a good five seconds from having a coronary.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio... Are you okay?" Agatha's voice was concerned but there was still a lightness to it, like she realized that nothing was
     <i>
      wrong
     </i>
     but something had stopped her in her tracks.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... But I..." Rio fumbled, her eyes cutting back to Hēmi who had also started to grin.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced to her side at the two grinning idiots next to her and felt completely out of the loop, and it showed on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is someone going to explain since my fiancée is too incapacitated to speak?" Agatha bit, though it was more out of confusion than anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hēmi plays Prop #3 for the All Blacks. We did not know you guys were coming home, obviously, or I would have at least tried to prep her!" By the time he finished speaking, Nicky was damn near giggling and the dawning realization washed over Agatha's expression.
    </p>
<p>
     She whipped her head to the side, pinning Rio with a narrowed gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     "Really!? You had dinner with two of Hollywood's biggest names right now and
     <i>
      this
     </i>
     is what stuns you?!" It was a little shrill, and the disbelief was there, but Rio could so clearly hear the goading and playfulness in Agatha's tone.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, Rio found her sense -- or, at least some of it -- but she was still transfixed on Hēmi.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're Hēmi Manaaki. You... You played in the Bunnings for Auckland before joining the All Blacks two years ago." It was said like a statement, but the truth was that Rio just needed to hear it out loud, even if it came from her own lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am. And I am also incredibly flattered that you know that." His voice was so warm and he looked like he genuinely was taken aback by not only the awe, but by the knowledge Rio possessed about his career.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was watching, completely and entirely tickled, as she was bearing witness to a new side of the woman she loved.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman who had never had any idea who Agatha was until she saw her on the Oscars.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman who had dinner with Hollywood stars and did not bat an eye.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman who was currently shell-shocked in her own home because she was meeting a rugby player from her favorite team.
    </p>
<p>
     There truly was no end to the wonder Rio could bring to Agatha's life, and it showed on Agatha's face.
    </p>
<p>
     "And..." Rio managed, raising a feeble finger to wave it back and forth in indication. "You... this...
     <i>
      you guys? Together?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The delighted humor on Agatha's expression only seemed to grow. She had literally never had any chance to see Rio like this before, bumbling and trying to feel her way through a conversation without completely wrecking herself in the process.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, ma'am," Hēmi responded, though Rio did not miss the way he glanced toward Nicky as he answered, or the way his smile seemed to grow as he did it.
    </p>
<p>
     "This was most assuredly not on her bingo card this year, so please forgive her for being entirely incoherent," Agatha supplemented in Rio's silence as she looked toward Hēmi, her smile pushing up her cheeks so high that it almost looked it her eyes were closed.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am just..." Rio managed, her heart still racing in her chest at the feeling of not knowing how to behave in front of someone she held a great deal of admiration and appreciation for in such a regard.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had always loved rugby, ever since she was eight and her papa had taken her to her first match. She had even played a bit of it in secondary school, but she realized pretty quickly that she did not possess the brute force or dexterity needed for it. Still, it had never quelled her appreciation for it, though.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe it had rooted with her father and those games when she was a kid, but the older Rio got, the more it became an escape. It was a chance every week to get away, to watch the thrilling game of catch and chase as it unfolded before her eyes. There was something exhilarating about the way impacts could sometimes be heard from the stands. There was also something about the unity that being a team provided in that specific way that was moving to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Watching fifteen players get into a scrum formation could get her blood pumping every time. It was about the fight, the battle to prove who wanted it more. It was a ferocity that Rio as a human had never had much of in her life, and so she chose to live vicariously through a sports team that she'd loved for most of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am in awe, I guess," Rio finally managed. "I've always just sat in the stands, never one to push the pitch in celebration. So... I suppose I am just appreciative of your hard work and dedication."
    </p>
<p>
     Two heads down, the look on Agatha's face had softened exponentially. It was almost like she was understanding it through seeing it. There was respect written all over Rio's face, and while she was quick to show respect to her family, this was a little different.
    </p>
<p>
     This was a physical presence of something important to Rio, something that had been a part of her for almost as long as she could actually remember.
    </p>
<p>
     Although it took another moment, Rio found it in her to move in a way that allowed her to come around the side of the couch, stopping behind Agatha as her hand landed between Agatha's shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     "What I have been meaning to say this entire time is that it's a pleasure to meet you too, Hēmi."
    </p>
<p>
     She leaned forward and extended a hand that he met easily, giving a light shake.
    </p>
<p>
     "So..." Agatha drawled as she absentmindedly reached up for Rio's hand as she retracted it and used it so that she could drape it over her shoulder. Rio let her palm fall to Agatha's chest as the hand that had been on her back slid to rest on the opposite shoulder. "Surprise! We are home early! Where are the girls?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was grinning there behind her, not only because of the way Agatha was speaking, but because Rio could literally feel her vibrating with the joy this had bestowed upon her. It had been a pleasant surprise, but she could tell that for Agatha, it was a little more.
    </p>
<p>
     It was an opportunity to do right. She could play the annoying mom card, sure, and she absolutely would. However, this was... different. This was Agatha realizing that she had stumbled into a moment that would be a hallmark for Nicky if this relationship went somewhere. It was surely not how he had intended things to go, but if Rio knew anything, she knew that Agatha was not going to fuck this up for him, even if she did have her fun in the process.
    </p>
<p>
     "They went for a surf but said they'd be back after they got dinner. Knowing them, they're probably tipsy, holding hands and walking through the street downtown talking about all the different uses for seaweed."
    </p>
<p>
     As obscure as that would have sounded, he'd pretty much hit the nail on the head.
    </p>
<p>
     In turn, it made Rio burst into laughter, leaning over Agatha slightly in her humor. It was a very vivid reminder of how wild their children could be, and how silly.
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, Rio was reminded of that text message with its little emoji. The tender smile that formed as she straightened back up was something Rio was glad Agatha could not see, even if it might not have seemed so out of place with where they currently were.
    </p>
<p>
     They really did have some amazing kids.
    </p>
<p>
     The four of them had sat like that, Rio shifting only slightly so that she could rub Agatha's shoulders in a unconscious show of affection every so often. They talked about the basics, about where Hēmi grew up, some of his favorite things to do.
    </p>
<p>
     When he brought up his love for photography, Rio could feel in Agatha's shoulders where the pieces fell into place in her mind. That was the tie, for those two men. Looking at the world through a lens and capturing its beauty was where the pull to one another had probably started. It was clear, even in the little glances they stole at one another, that something more was growing, though.
    </p>
<p>
     Listening to him talk about his family, the little spots he tucked away in as he grew older, Rio was thankful for it, but not for the reasons anyone else might have thought.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was getting to literally feel beneath her fingertips as Agatha ingested a new point of view on a place Rio loved so dearly. She was getting snippets from someone else, from an outside perspective that had an entirely different appreciation for where they now lived as a family. For Hēmi, his entire life was grounded in family and it showed in the way he spoke and held himself.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a deeply rooted sense of pride in being Māori and Hēmi was a perfect display of that.
    </p>
<p>
     As the conversation wound down, Hēmi had announced that it was probably best he head home and get some rest before he had to be up early enough to make it to training on time. The three occupants on the couch joined Rio in her position on her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched as, with a wide and sweeping smile that was -- as Estee had put it -- so very handsome, Hēmi turned to Agatha and lifted his arms for an embrace. Agatha stepped in and gave him a very gentle and very motherly hug, patting his back as she let go.
    </p>
<p>
     "It has been a treat getting to know you. I hope that you would like to make this a habit in the future, because I think I speak for the both of us," Agatha said, indicating with a sweet flourish of her hand toward where Rio stood just behind her, "when I say we would be delighted to have you."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha released her hold on his biceps and stepped back, an automatic hand sliding to the small of Rio's back to guide her forward.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ms. Vidal," he acknowledge with that same smile and a gentle tip of his head to ask if she would like a hug too.
    </p>
<p>
     He didn't know it, but that unasked question was a stupid one.
    </p>
<p>
     While she was able to find restraint over the course of their evening, there was something about hugging him, knowing that this was the man someone she loved was growing to care for that made the moment just a little bit more special for her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let him go and Nicky was swift in picking up his hand and offering to walk him out, despite that jocular look that was written all over Agatha's expression. He didn't appear to be antsy or uncomfortable; it was more something along the lines of 'Holy shit, you just survived meeting the parents.'
    </p>
<p>
     As the door pulled shut behind them, Agatha immediately sank into Rio side, her arm hooking around Rio's back as she let her head fall to rest atop Rio's shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     "I didn't fuck that up, right?" Agatha asked softly and even though her voice was low, Rio could still hear the edge of trepidation as it snuck in.
    </p>
<p>
     "You did not fuck that up, my love," Rio soothed, turning her head just enough to place a kiss to the top of Agatha's head, centered in the middle part of her hair. "In fact, I truly do think we will be seeing more of him. Did you catch the way he looked at Nicky when he was talking?"
    </p>
<p>
     For as wide as Rio's grin was, she could feel against where Agatha had her face pressed to Rio's form where hers may have been bigger.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicky looked pretty smitten, too, don't you think?" Agatha asked back, the softest laughter spilling from her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted slightly in a way that prompted Agatha to lift her head so that they were eye-to-eye again. There was no hesitation from Rio as she leaned toward her and stole a sweet kiss, a hand raising to lay flat against her chest. They stood like that for a long moment, just watching, just listening for the things that might not get said. Finally, Rio spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "Before... all of this," Rio voiced, her free hand waving around them to indicate the state of their entire life, "Nicky's answer was to run. It was to protect himself, and to do what he needed to in order to get by. But the young man that just sat there for an hour, holding the hand of his boyfriend, while they got the third-degree... He's not the same Nicky that went to Dubai. Hell, I don't even think he's the same Nicky we came home that night from the hotel."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could see the emotion winning out, first in Agatha's eyes and then in each muscle of her face. This was what happened when Rio knew exactly how to point out the things Agatha needed to hear.
    </p>
<p>
     "And... I think that we should be sinking stock into the fact that he is invested in trying to find relationships here. Even if doing so means giving me a heart attack."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha breathed a soft laugh and Rio's hand raised to cup her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     "Just remember that we're all learning new things about each other every single day. There's never going to be a wrong way to do that, so long as we let it inform how we move forward. So... as we always do, we just take it a day at a time."
    </p>
<p>
     With this piece of sage wisdom, Rio leaned forward and pressed her lips to Agatha's in a tender but chaste kiss before she pulled away, but was still close enough that their fronts brushed with any movement or shift.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had started to suggest that they get down a bottle of wine and fold into bed for the rest of the evening, but before she could, she heard the sound of giggles and laughter from outside the front door.
    </p>
<p>
     A moment later, the door opened and their three children came shuffling in.
    </p>
<p>
     Their little triad of diamonds.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh! Good! You're on you're feet!" Estee chirped as Rio turned around to face the door, though her hand stayed stationed on Agatha's chest as she did so.
    </p>
<p>
     "No thanks to literally any of you?!" Rio managed back, pitch a little higher than normal.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, in my defense... I just knew he played. I did not know until literally two minutes ago as he was leaving
     <i>
      who
     </i>
     he played for! So, that one can be all Nick's fault," Estee stated with another burst of giggles as she leaned into Tay who caught her with ease and kept her on her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes narrowed but the grin she wore was instant and absolutely amused.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hm," Rio blew out in a puff of air. "Meeting Nicky's boyfriend
     <i>
      and
     </i>
     seeing my daughter drunk? This really
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     the best night to come home."
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The five of them had gathered in the living room for a little while to catch up and Estee and Tay had not hesitated to ask for every detail there was to be had about Rio's experience meeting Jack and Thea. It had been so cute to see how excited they were, as well as the looks on their tipsy faces when Rio assured them that Jack and Thea both expressed their excitement in getting the chance to meet them, whether it was at the wedding or before.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been this strange feeling of peace and serenity, of sheer rapture that had warmed them like a thick blanket as they just... did what families did.
    </p>
<p>
     After only a little while, though, the exhaustion had started to creep in. Sure, it was a given for Agatha and Rio who had spent almost the last three quarters of their day on a plane, but Rio could see it in the way Nicky sagged into the couch and the way Estee's eyes had fallen closed as her head rested against Tay's shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been the first to get to her feet, but she was quick in pulling Agatha up behind her. They each showered all three of the kids with cheek kisses and soft 'goodnights' before they turned to depart. As Agatha headed for the stairs, though, Rio let go of her hand in a way that allowed her to run her fingertips along Agatha's palm and the entire length of her fingers until they separated. Agatha had started to offer protest but Rio held up a finger in a request for just a moment as she floated her way to the kitchen only to return a moment later with a bottle of red and two wine glasses.
    </p>
<p>
     "A goodnight snack," she had indicated, holding her full hands up with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     They had made their way up to their little corner of heaven and the moment Rio set down the bottle and glasses on her nightstand, she felt as Agatha's hands landed on her sides and she stepped into Rio's back. Her lips pressed to the back right of Rio's hair, stilled there for just a moment as Agatha breathed in the scent of her shampoo.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Do you know..."
     </i>
     Agatha murmured against her scalp,
     <i>
      "That there is not a single day since I have met you where I have not questioned the fabric of reality itself?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio giggled softly, leaning her head back into the contact the slightest bit.
     <i>
      "Please do elaborate, I feel like this is good,"
     </i>
     she beseeched, that giggle still sparking through her words.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hands began to shift, winding their way around Rio's front to wrap around her, holding her close. Agatha's face moved but only to tuck inward in the way that allowed her to place a kiss to the side of Rio's head.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "There are these... moments. They don't last long, but there's one or two a day... They just feel like they exist outside of time. There are certain points when I look at you, or Estee, or Nicky, or Tay and I am struck with such a profound sense of..."
     </i>
     Agatha hesitated, her lips twisting in thought, but she seemed dissatisfied with what she was managing to grab hold of.
     <i>
      "Ack, 'love' just doesn't feel strong enough. I guess it just feels like, when that happens, that this will be a life I have no matter how many times I revisit this earth. This is what is meant for me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The longer Agatha had talked, the more Rio could feel herself melting. She knew that while Agatha was aware of the power of her words, she also sometimes doubted herself in trying to convey what she needed to clearly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned back into her, humming softly at the security and warmth she felt there every single time it was where she wound up.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Do
      <b>
       you
      </b>
      know that when you say things like that, it makes me feel like 'love' doesn't cut it, either?"
     </i>
     Rio breathed at her in something that hardly reached the registers of a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head ducked a little bit lower as she pressed her lips to the crook of Rio's neck, her hands sliding up to cross over Rio's chest, squeezing her tightly.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I am yours forever, Rio,"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured against her skin,
     <i>
      "And I'll remind you every single day."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's head turned, causing her lips to brush Agatha's forehead immediately, her own soft words spilling over skin.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And I am yours, my hopeless romantic,"
     </i>
     Rio returned, though she had not been able to keep the soft prodding out of her words.
    </p>
<p>
     The tightening of Agatha's grip just seemed to prove her point.

</p>

<p>
     In the Harkness-Vidal household, time had a strange way of working.
    </p>
<p>
     On one side of the coin, it was as if it was slow, it was careful, it was patient. There, in the softest moments, it could have stilled and not one of the five of them would have been the wiser. It was intentional in the way that every memory made in every second was there for an impression, branded into who they were as individuals and who they were as a family.
    </p>
<p>
     On the other side of that coin, it felt to Rio like she had blinked a couple of times and suddenly, they were only weeks from their trip to Los Angeles for their
     <i>
      wedding.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It still didn't feel real. They'd picked a venue, they'd picked a cake, and in a move that was so
     <i>
      them
     </i>
     , they had also decided on the attire. There was something different about it, though, something that was unique to them and also very indicative of who they were as a couple that was about to tie their lives together.
    </p>
<p>
     They had chosen one another's outfits.
    </p>
<p>
     They had each laid out specifications: Rio wanted a suit. She didn't care what color it was, but she was absolutely not going to be climbing into a dress if it could be avoided for this experience. It wasn't to say she would never wear one, but for this, it simply wasn't what she wanted.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, however, certainly wanted a dress. It couldn't be too frilly, couldn't be too flashy. The color was up for choice, as well, but it had to be anything other than white.
    </p>
<p>
     That had made Rio grin. Of course Agatha would toss even
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     tradition out the window.
    </p>
<p>
     What it came down to was that they, as a couple, had been and likely always would be a little more on the unconventional side. Nothing about them had ever made sense and yet, they just worked. They were complimentary to one another in that they did not need to complete each other because as individuals, they were already whole.
    </p>
<p>
     Finding Agatha had been like finding an addition Rio had never known needed to be built onto her life to provide more room for the love she was capable of feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     Part of the exchange was that neither of them would see their clothing until the day of the wedding. Agatha's dress had arrived already and was stored safely in the closet of Estee and Tay's room in the big house. What Rio did not know was that her suit was sitting in Nicky's closet for the same very reason.
    </p>
<p>
     With the trip and the idea of the honeymoon after -- which was going to be in Iceland, per Agatha's insistence that Rio experience snow for the first time in her life -- Rio had decided to make it her mission to dedicate what time she could to work before then.
    </p>
<p>
     It was her intention to finish it, to get that damn drone off of that desk. She knew that it meant spending her additional time hunched over her laptop, glasses at the end of her nose as she wrote and edited code for hours on end. Rio knew she was close. She knew that if she could just keep pushing, she would be able to complete it before they left.
    </p>
<p>
     With just under two weeks until that happened, she was beginning to panic over the fact that she might not actually meet such an accomplishment. She did what she could to keep a lid on that worry but it still sat there and she knew that if it got much worse, Agatha was going to pick up on it and Rio feared that if she was confronted about it, she was going to fall apart.
    </p>
<p>
     The work Rio was doing was important to her. It was a dedication of years of her life and she could feel that she was so close to the top, so close to victory but there were certain lines that had been giving her hell for days and she was bordering on driving herself up a wall to figure it out.
    </p>
<p>
     So, it was a Sunday afternoon and they had thirteen days left until they got on a plane -- The Hoatzin, as it turned out -- to head for America. That was thirteen days for Rio to figure this the fuck out.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was hunched at her desk in the office, leaning forward to get close enough to the screen to see if she might somehow be able to locate her error by magnifying her ability to see it. As if it was going to work on the eight-hundredth try as opposed to the other seven-hundred-ninety-nine times before it.
    </p>
<p>
     On the couch in the office sat her fiancée, knees pulled up with an iPad propped against them. Agatha had stated that Jack had sent her some footage from what he was working on and asked her to review it. There were times when Rio would glance over and Agatha's nose was scrunched, or she pulled down the large glasses that Rio had been offended to know she needed sometimes to pinch the bridge of her nose. Rio's offense wasn't to her having them, it was to the fact that for as big of a deal as Agatha had made about Rio wearing glasses, she had never supplemented the information on her own.
    </p>
<p>
     This, she told Rio, was because she had hated them; she insisted they made her look like her mother. Rio had quickly asserted that she didn't know what Agatha's mother had looked like, but if it was anywhere close to the demonic vision she had in her head, she was far prettier.
    </p>
<p>
     It was this tiny showing, one of a few since Evanora had died, that Agatha was taking back the control in her life. There were other ways she had been doing that, ways that were far more intimate.
    </p>
<p>
     It was how, one night after they'd gone to the beach so Rio could surf for a little while Agatha sat on the sand watching her, they had come home and fell into one another as they usually did but Agatha made a decision that Rio had never been anticipating.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had taken hold of Rio's hand and moved it to where her wrist had been laying above her head. Agatha had been very deliberate in the way she had locked Rio's fingers around it and the way she had met Rio's gaze with her own before whispering the softest
     <i>
      Don't let go.
     </i>
     It had done something to Rio that first time that she hardly knew how to place, let alone explain.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had trauma, that was something Rio was aware of. The fact that Agatha, in that beautiful head of hers, was actively taking steps to cope with that trauma? It was so fucking emotional that Rio simply needed time to process it, though in the moment she had complied. Even when Agatha had started to jerk away, despite the soft but pleasured 'Don't' that slipped through her lips, Rio had still listened.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been no tears, even if there had been a strong showing of emotion as Rio tended to the after-care part of what Agatha needed most. Agatha had taken the leap, and Rio had been right there to catch her. The pride it had caused her was so insane that Rio had been convinced she could not keep it contained.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha loved her more than she knew how to say, so she chose ways to show Rio instead.
    </p>
<p>
     It had started happening with a little more frequency, Agatha sacrificing those modicums of control and giving herself over a bit more each time to someone she knew was never going to hurt her when in that position of power.
    </p>
<p>
     Similarly, Rio loved Agatha more than she knew how to say, so she chose to listen instead.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was always listening, even then as she sat at her desk and heard every sigh and giggle that would flitter out of Agatha at whatever was holding her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would sit back, lean forward, type furiously and then repeat the process. Somewhere in her fourth bout, she'd caught something out of the corner of her eye. Agatha had started doing something that was probably a tick, something she likely didn't even realize she was doing. Her hand would move as she flicked her wrist, her fingers flexing in the air. It was such an absent-minded gesture that Rio was sure Agatha had no clue just how much it was catching her attention from across the room.
    </p>
<p>
     For the first few minutes, Rio tried to ignore it. Every time Agatha did it, though, Rio couldn't help but to steal a glance at her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hair was pulled back and tied into a ponytail at the base of her skull and those clear-framed glasses looked somehow cuter when she frowned and those little lines between her eyebrows appeared over the frame. Her lips would twitch into a smile, or sometimes a frown, but each time Rio looked at her, she appeared entirely focused and concentrated.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked so effortlessly good in those shorts that were too short for public purview but perfect for Rio's. With the way she was sitting, Rio could see the tiniest sliver of her ass cheek which would cause her lips to curl involuntarily every single time she managed to sneak a glance.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew she needed to be working. How could she when the love of her life was sitting there surely aware of just how attractive she was being every time she made a face or heaved a sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned back to her work, but it was only another minute before that flicking of Agatha's wrist caught her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, she had to say something.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can you not?" Rio asked softly, though it was a little accusatory in tone as she leaned back in her chair and swiveled in it to look at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand raised to pause the video she was watching and looked up, a completely innocent expression written over her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is something bothering you, my love?" she returned sweetly in a way that made Rio's stomach curl with affection. That look in Agatha's eyes gave her away, though.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     what she was doing.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are being distracting," Rio returned, trying to keep her voice harder but failing spectacularly.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm just watching my videos," Agatha replied coolly, casting her eyes back down to the iPad in indication before they raised back to Rio. "Would you like me to go to another room?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could hear Agatha's enticement so loudly that she could almost swear she felt it, too, prickling over her skin like small ripples of electricity.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know I don't," Rio snapped back, though her face fell when she caught her tone.
    </p>
<p>
     "Then what can I do to help you?" Agatha posed, head tilting in that little way that Rio adored so much, even when Agatha was being a little bit of an asshole.
    </p>
<p>
     "Stop doing that... that flicking thing with your hand. I keep seeing it and I can't focus."
    </p>
<p>
     As if in challenge, Agatha's hand raised and she repeated the exact same motion. It made Rio grit her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha, I'm serious. I'm trying to get this done and you're not helping." Agatha flourished her hand yet again and Rio could feel the desire beginning to pool in her middle.
    </p>
<p>
     "As my question implied a moment ago, I would be more than happy to go somewhere else."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes narrowed. They narrowed even further as Agatha flicked her wrist again.
    </p>
<p>
     "You would not, don't even try," Rio clipped back. This time, as Agatha waved her hand, Rio's jaw bulged and she was seconds away from launching out of that chair and pinning Agatha down to that couch.
    </p>
<p>
     "But I do not want to bother you with the distraction of my hand waving," Agatha replied, that faux-sincerity clinging tightly to her words.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's only bothering me because there are
     <i>
      other
     </i>
     places I would like that hand to be, but I am on a deadline I have set for myself and I really
     <i>
      need
     </i>
     to get this done."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's smile twisted into something that aligned more in a smirk as she locked the iPad and shifted to set it down on the side table behind her. She moved with such ease that it was driving Rio insane, especially as she slowly turned back to her position and flattened her legs.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think you've been working too hard, baby. You deserve a break." She was using that tone of voice that was
     <i>
      so fucking hard
     </i>
     for Rio to ignore, and Agatha knew it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha --" Rio had started to growl, but the way Agatha tugged at the collar of her own shirt shut Rio up pretty quickly, her lips pressing as her jaw tightened again.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think you just need to relax a little," Agatha informed her, though the hand that had tugged at her collar was now moving, very slowly dragging its way down her chest. "Maybe blow off some steam..." And lower still it went. By the time Agatha's fingers curled around the hem of her shirt, Rio was launching to her feet so she could cross the room to her fiancée in about two strides.
    </p>
<p>
     "No!" Rio cried, grabbing hold of Agatha's wrist to pull her hand back, a pout forming on her lips as she looked down at Agatha who was brightly grinning up at her, looking like she'd gotten exactly what she wanted the second Rio had gotten out of that chair.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, would you look at that," Agatha cooed, eyes shimmering with mischief. "You decided to take a break after all. Why don't you sit down and take a load off?" She used her free hand to pat at her lap.
    </p>
<p>
     Looking into those beautiful blue eyes, Rio knew what her answer would inevitably be, but the stress she was letting herself feel over being so close to finishing this project was giving her pause.
    </p>
<p>
     She glanced down and realized she was still holding Agatha's wrist. As it registered on her face, her eyes flickered up and Agatha's grin was damn near sinister.
    </p>
<p>
     "Come on, baby," she beguiled, turning her hand slightly so she could take hold of Rio's arm, too, giving her a gentle tug. "We don't even have to do anything, you just need to step away for a little bit to clear your head." She gave another pull and this time, Rio caved and placed herself on Agatha's lap, her back to the couch cushions. The indignancy had written itself all over her face, but she had listened nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted, sitting up so that she could wrap her arms around Rio's middle and placed a soft kiss to the side of her shoulder. "See, doesn't it feel better to not be staring at a computer screen for a few minutes?" she murmured against the sleeve of Rio's t-shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio breathed a soft sigh, tipping her head back slightly. It
     <i>
      did
     </i>
     feel good to step away, even for a minute. She'd been pouring so much more time into work than she'd realized, but Agatha had caught on. What was more was that she hadn't gotten upset. She'd simply let Rio do what she needed to do, always hovering close by if she needed anything.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's arm around Rio's front dropped, her hand landing atop Rio's thigh, a little too close to her hip than she thought Agatha might try for, and honestly? It gave her a sense of relief she did not think it could, and she did not want to admit it right then simply to save face.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha sank her fingertips into Rio's flesh, though, it elicited a soft whimper.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio tried to warn but the way her name came out was weak and lacked resolve.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Let me distract you. You just need some stress relief,"
     </i>
     Agatha assured her, peppering kisses over the small expanse of shoulder in front of her. At the same time, her hand slid a little more inward so that her thumb slid between the limited space where Rio's thighs were pressed together as she sat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted again, this time to lean closer to Rio, past her shoulders, so that she could place a kiss to the hollow of her throat, and then another one above it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Agathaaaa,"
     </i>
     Rio managed again, but this time it was nothing more than a soft whine. It only drew on even longer the moment Agatha's thumb shifted to place a firm pressure between Rio's legs, even if only in that tiny spot. The contact caused a wave of heat to fire from the base of Rio's skull, all the way down her back.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Taking an hour away is not going to completely corrupt the robot bees, my love,"
     </i>
     Agatha muttered against Rio's skin and it sent another shiver coursing through her entire body.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips moved, paving a path of kisses around to the side of Rio's neck, all the way up to her ear, which was caught between Agatha's teeth a moment later. This pried a soft moan from Rio's lips as she squirmed slightly, hips shifting in tamed want. That want only got worse the more pressure Agatha applied with her thumb.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Are you gonna let me take your clothes off so that I can distract you properly?"
     </i>
     Agatha pressed in a husky whisper directly into Rio's ear, succeeding in gripping and dragging a soft moan from her throat.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "That is not an answer,"
     </i>
     Agatha chastised, biting a little higher up on Rio's ear, consuming more cartilage on that one.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, Rio's moan was louder and she was growing more frantic in the way she kept shifting. In response, Agatha's grip tightened and her thumb attempted to press harder, but there was nowhere else for it to go.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Jesus Christ, yes!"
     </i>
     Rio finally hissed, reaching down to strip her shirt over her head. The moment it was off, she was clamoring around in a way that allowed her to straddle Agatha's thighs.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did not hesitate for even a second as Rio relocated to quickly move her hand to right between Rio's legs as she lowered, establishing a firm presence that caused Rio's head to tip back just slightly as a heavy sigh escaped her.
    </p>
<p>
     The hand that was not pressed to the fabric of Rio's shorts raised to hook two fingers into the front of her bra as Agatha pulled her forward so that their lips could meet and she could taste what she'd been so starved for for all afternoon.
    </p>
<p>
     The longer the kiss drew on and the hotter it got with the way Agatha's tongue was pillaging Rio's mouth like that, Rio was starting to lose her mind. It got even worse as she felt Agatha's hand as it began a back and forth that created just enough friction that Rio could feel it in every inch of her body all at once.
    </p>
<p>
     By the third moan Rio had dumped into Agatha's mouth, it was clear that while Agatha was having her fun, she was also growing restless. That was proven by the way that Rio was nearly convinced that Agatha's touch was going to rip right through her shorts and sink into her body.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nearly jerked back, eyes flying open as Rio's did the same. What met her when she looked down at Agatha was that familiar hunger she always developed in the more raw moments like that one.
    </p>
<p>
     Being wanted like that never got old.
    </p>
<p>
     She sat up a little more as her hands fell to Rio's hips and her face pressed directly in the space between Rio's breasts that still sat perkily in their cage of her silk bra.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand involuntarily shot up to cradle the back of Agatha's head as she kissed and sucked and licked at the skin before her. Rio's stomach felt like it was in a constant state of somersaulting while her middle pooled with a heat that almost felt unbearable.
    </p>
<p>
     Somewhere in the midst of her ravishing, Agatha's hand had snaked up Rio's back and had freed the clasp there, though she had not immediately removed herself from the meal she was delighting in. That left Rio, in her frenzy, to reach up with the hand that wasn't on Agatha's had to try and remove it.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Agatha sensed what she was doing, her teeth sank into the top of Rio's breast, causing her to yelp at the unexpected bite. Her fingers flexed into Agatha's hair but she only pushed her closer, craving more.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it every single place that Agatha's fingertips dragged down her back, over the bunched up material of her shorts and to her thigh. It circled back inward but this time, Agatha did not reapply that same hold she'd been enforcing before. Instead, her fingers tucked into the leg of those shorts and around the hem of Rio's underwear, fingers finding a gathered wetness that was all too familiar to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's body shook at the contact, her hips rocking down into Agatha's touch.
    </p>
<p>
     As those agile fingers began to explore, Rio was nearly pulsing everywhere with her sudden desire. While she was almost always pliable the moment Agatha touched her like that, this was different. This was a promise of releasing some of the stress she had been building because of work. This was Agatha knowing exactly what to do to make her feel better.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had finally had enough of that unfastened bra as it hung off of her chest and reached up to rip it off, her hand landing right back on Agatha's head as she tossed it away.
    </p>
<p>
     The longer Agatha pushed and pressed against Rio's sex, the more desperate Rio grew.
    </p>
<p>
     The hand resting atop Agatha's hair gripped and pulled back, causing the mouthful of Rio's nipple to suction away suddenly, leaving her with open and starving eyes that bore into Rio's the moment they met.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I need more,"
     </i>
     Rio released in a whine of necessity. Even before Rio could hunch over to kiss Agatha, Agatha's fingers -- two, judging by the slight stretch-- slid inside of her, causing her to gasp at the feeling. The satisfaction followed shortly after as a soft
     <i>
      hmmmmm
     </i>
     rattled her teeth. They kissed and moaned and Rio's hips seemed to only grind harder the more she felt the undeniable tug of pleasure as it began to form just above where Agatha's fingers were curling inside of her. It wasn't quite enough.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "More, please,"
     </i>
     Rio begged against Agatha's lips, her voice thick with her desperation though her hips never stopped moving. As she lifted, Agatha seized the opportunity and sunk in another digit, causing Rio to surge forward, her face tucking into the side of Agatha's hair, lips dangerously close to her ear.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "F-fuck, Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio choked out, the pace of her hips only increasing as she tried to get as much of Agatha inside of her as was humanly possible.
    </p>
<p>
     After only a few more moments of effort, Rio's hips finally slammed down in a way that forced every bit of of Agatha's hand to collide directly with every available inch of Rio's core. It was a move that also garnered the full length of Agatha's fingers to fill her in a way that almost felt like she could touch Rio's fucking soul.
    </p>
<p>
     The moan that dumped from her chest fell right into Agatha's ear with the way they were situated, and if she had not been so taken by her orgasm, Rio might have felt the way Agatha completely stiffened at every point beneath her in her own arousal. Instead, Agatha simply stayed like that, the pressure on Rio's hips not giving in the slightest until she was certain that every last bit of that orgasm was finished in its journey through Rio's entire body.
    </p>
<p>
     Panting, Rio finally found herself once more and pulled back, her hands landing on Agatha's shoulders as she garnered the ability to lift herself up enough to unpin Agatha's hand from where it had been trapped between her body and Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
     The look on Agatha's face was absolutely wicked with want as she moved her hand up, almost moving for her own mouth, but Rio caught her wrist in a much swifter fashion than she'd thought herself capable of in the moment. Voracious lips slid over Agatha's wet fingers, sucking them into her mouth and making sure to clean them appropriately with a fervent tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     This did exactly what Rio intended for it to do. Agatha's eyes damn near rolled into the back of her head as it tipped back and she let out a guttural groan that damn near worked Rio all the way back up again.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're a goddamn vixen,"
     </i>
     Agatha managed in a strangled tone that was quite pressed with just how turned on she was.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lowered Agatha's hand but didn't let go of it as it landed on Agatha's stomach right in front of where Rio sat. There was intention there, and Agatha seemed to notice it as her eyes dropped down to their hands and then raised back up to Rio's. There was no longer any sense of panic there, no sense of wanting to resist or hide. Instead, Agatha leaned forward again to kiss Rio, not otherwise moving.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let Agatha take the lead, here. She was still clutching Agatha's wrist in her hand as it rested, but the other one raised to cup Agatha's cheek as the kiss deepened in intensity. Despite the silent permission Rio was being offered, she needed Agatha naked to capitalize on it.
    </p>
<p>
     She did drop her hold, but only to reach for the hem of Agatha's shirt so that she could indicate that she wanted it off. Agatha complied by parting their lips and leaning back enough to allow space for it to be removed and Rio quickly did away with the shirt, pleased to see that in her lounging state, Agatha had not put a bra on.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat back just a moment atop Agatha's thighs and just... admired her. She was the perfect combination of adorable and sexy at the same time in a way that drove Rio insane. Rio also, in that very moment, understood why Agatha was so obsessed every time Rio put on a pair of glasses. Agatha had always been beautiful, but there was just something about the way her cheeks pushed up the frame of them just slightly when she grinned that dissolved Rio into a complete puddle.
    </p>
<p>
     While Agatha had been loud and clear about the permissions that were being given, Rio wanted to simply appreciate her for a moment. With a tentative hand, Rio reached forward and graced her fingertips along Agatha's collarbone on the left side. It was something Rio had done time and time again when they found themselves in such a position, but every single time it was out of approbation and a reverence that screamed just how loud Rio's love for her was.
    </p>
<p>
     Feeling Agatha's soft skin beneath her fingertips as they skated the scape of her body, the mountaintops of her breasts to the valleys of her abdomen, it was always a rush for Rio, especially in the moments that were a little more charged than the more tender ones. Right then, just touching the warm expanse of Agatha's body, Rio felt like she was conducting lightning due to the look on her lover's face.
    </p>
<p>
     When she was satisfied with the complete sheet of goosebumps that had blanketed over Agatha's skin, Rio began to shift so that she could hook her fingers into the waist of Agatha's shorts. It was quick work to tug them down and slide them off of her legs, taking the thong she'd been wearing with them. In the same breath, Agatha had scooted down enough so that her head was propped against the pillow that had been behind her back and with her legs fully extended, the backs of her heels rested on the opposite arm of the couch.
    </p>
<p>
     With all of Agatha's clothes out of her way, Rio moved in a way that she was able to place her right knee between Agatha's thigh and the back of the couch and the other fell between Agatha's legs in a way that separated them enough for what Rio wanted to do.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio settled, Agatha's hands fell to her hips, but it didn't last long. Rio was reaching and grabbing, nimble fingers wrapping around Agatha's slender wrists.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio did next was
     <i>
      very
     </i>
     intentional and
     <i>
      very
     </i>
     loud in regards to what she knew Agatha needed.
    </p>
<p>
     In both of her own, Rio brought Agatha's hands up, leaning to meet them as Rio graced the backs of Agatha's knuckles with her lips, one at a time. She kissed her fingertips, the backs of her hands in a loving manner that she had hoped could speak the comfort she knew words might not offer.
    </p>
<p>
     Pressing her lips to the back of Agatha's fingers, Rio's loving gaze fell into hers and a smile curled her lips against Agatha's skin.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you, Agatha,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed softly, placing one more kiss to a couple of her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I hear you,"
     </i>
     Agatha voiced back, the smallest hitching of her lips happening. It probably would have been wider if she wasn't so turned on in the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't need her to say it back because she already knew. What she chose to say was what Rio had actually needed to hear. It was an acknowledgement, a brandishing of the truth. Agatha knew Rio loved her, and she also knew that Rio was not going to do anything to ever cause her any intentional harm. More than that, Rio recognized it as Agatha's way of telling her that everything she had done up to that moment had been obvious, blaring directly in her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Every single thing Rio
     <i>
      chose
     </i>
     to do left no room for question; she would take care of Agatha in any way she could, would care for her and love her endlessly. Nothing Rio ever
     <i>
      chose
     </i>
     to do would ever cause any kind of harm to the woman beneath her.
    </p>
<p>
     So, Rio pulled Agatha's hands away from her lips but still held them firmly as she began to lean forward, moving so that she could place them against the armrest of the couch above Agatha's head, pressure firm but not rough as she secured them there.
    </p>
<p>
     A moment later, Rio scooted forward on her knees, right first then followed by the left which fell flush against Agatha's wet warmth with a firm presence. This was deliberate in every way. Agatha was giving Rio her trust and in turn, Rio was letting Agatha hold some of the power here.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head ducked and their lips met in a hungry kiss, but one that still maintained some semblance of tenderness. Rio knew no other way to be when it came to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Hungry and Soft, the Rio Vidal Story.
    </p>
<p>
     The thought flashed for the briefest moment and she almost breathed a laugh into Agatha's mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     As quickly as it came, it was gone and Rio was right back in the zone. Her hands slid from Agatha's wrists to her palms so that she could link her fingers through the spaces in Agatha's, using a little more of her weight to hold them where they were at almost the same exact moment that Agatha began to shift her hips, using the leverage she had against Rio's thigh to create a sense of friction that she was desperate for.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel every single place on her skin where Agatha was grinding her hips and the sticky wetness it was leaving in its wake.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Gods, Agatha was so fucking hot.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Their tongues found themselves in that typical battle, but Rio was putting up little fight. Without being told, she knew that engaging was important, but nothing about this centered around domination. The position they found themselves in was one of trust and intimacy. Agatha might have been pinned, but she was still in control.
    </p>
<p>
     She knew it, too, based on the pace she had picked up when it came to grinding against Rio's thigh. Rio did take it as silent encouragement and so, she met it with her decision. As much as she could, she moved her thigh forward to assert more pressure. The feral sound this elicited from Agatha was absolutely fucking delicious as it slid down Rio's throat.
    </p>
<p>
     She could then feel it as Agatha tensed below her, but Rio recognized it this time; Agatha was
     <i>
      close.
     </i>
     Rio pulled her lips away and dipped her head to catch the lobe of Agatha's ear between her teeth, giving it a firm bite as well as a tug. Her sultry murmur was so close to Agatha's ear that it could have gone nowhere else.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Come for me, pretty girl."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     No sooner had the words left Rio's lips than Agatha's hips pressed forward and the moan that followed could have damn near rattled the windows of that office. Her thighs locked around Rio's knee and her body actively began to tremble in that delicious way Rio loved and often craved.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's arms had flexed, but for the first time since they had begun this journey, she did not tense in panic. Instead, her fingertips curled hard into the backs of Rio's hands, clinging for dear life as the remnants of her orgasm pulsed through her.
    </p>
<p>
     After a moment, Agatha seemed to settle though her chest was still heaving slightly. Rio could tell she was trying to recover what cognition she could and while she did so, Rio moved enough so that her face was hovering above Agatha's, just watching her there with her eyes closed, that utter bliss woven into every last inch of her expression.
    </p>
<p>
     Still holding onto Agatha's hands there above her head, Rio leaned down to close the space between them, but she did so by placing a series of kisses over every bit of Agatha's face she could reach, saving the very last kiss for the tip of her nose. That move garnered the softest breathy giggle from Agatha who finally found the ability to form words.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Lay with me,"
     </i>
     she requested softly and who would Rio have been to tell her no?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached up and tugged the thin blanket off of the back of the couch and moved to lay herself on top of Agatha, warm skin falling flush as their bodies pressed together. The moment she came to a full rest, she could feel as Agatha's fingertips found her spine and started tracing light lines over it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you, baby."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It wasn't out of place for Agatha to state as such, but there was something about the tone of her voice, the quiet whisper it was that seemed to be a little louder to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you too, Agatha."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     They laid like that for a little while, at least until Agatha's hand stilled its motion and slowly slid off of Rio's side. That coupled with the fact that Agatha's heartbeat had slowed told Rio that she had fallen asleep. The realization made Rio's cheeks push up in a smile of nothing but pure love and admiration.
    </p>
<p>
     She had let herself stay there for a little while longer, but her eyes had fallen to her desk and the still-open laptop, the screen having gone black from lack of use.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's mind began to turn. She began to think of everything she had done in the last few days or so. Everything before that had been clean, had done what it was meant to do. What it in these last couple of days that had her so damn stumped? It might not have been an error; it was possible that there was just a broken line that needed completely replaced.
    </p>
<p>
     Sighing, Rio moved as carefully as she could to peel her body from Agatha's so that she could pull her clothes back on. Once finished, she draped the blanket back over Agatha's naked body just before she leaned down, a hand smoothing Agatha's hair as she placed a soft kiss to her forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, Rio got to work.
    </p>
<p>
     She had realized that the only way forward through this was to go back. If she had to run every single line individually, that was what she would do.
    </p>
<p>
     It had taken nearly forty five minutes, but she had located the cause of her distress. She spent another few minutes inputting the new line, her brow pinched tight in concentration. She read it over, then read it again.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, she read through what she had re-written, the nerves beginning to build the more she realized that she might have actually done it. By the time she reached the end, her eyes were nearly watering and she had to sit back in her chair to take in the weight of the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     All she had to do was press the 'enter' key. That was it, and it would tell her whether or not she had so much further to go.
    </p>
<p>
     All Rio had to do was reach forward.
    </p>
<p>
     She stared at the keyboard with an intensity that she normally could not conjure. It could be over. Seven years of work and five years of coding all culminated in that moment, in the quiet of that office with her naked fiancée asleep on the couch a few feet away.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio sat back up in the chair and raised a hand, her finger hovering nervously over the key she needed to press. Her eyes shifted down to the miniscule drone that sat in its stand on the desk. This could be it.
    </p>
<p>
     This really could be it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio looked at the screen again and took a deep breath.
    </p>
<p>
     She closed her eyes and dropped her hand, finger applying enough force to the key that it submitted the command.
    </p>
<p>
     Eyes still closed, Rio heard it.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Bzzzzzzzzzzzz.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It was the sound of the drone as it lifted off of the stand and hovered above it.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the sound of thousands of days' worth of progress.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the sound of Rio's hard work, infinite hours of it, as they culminated into a final product that she had only hoped for.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the sound of science evolving and progressing in their immediate future.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the sound of utter
     <i>
      triumph.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes finally opened and she saw it. She was stunned. She could hardly believe her own eyes, even though she could hear it, too. She submitted the cease command and the drone dropped back perfectly into its cradle.
    </p>
<p>
     There was complete silence as Rio just stared.
    </p>
<p>
     It was finished.
    </p>
<p>
     She had just completed the biggest accomplishment in her human life, and that was saying something considering what kind of person she'd grown to become since meeting Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The weight of it all slammed straight into her chest at one time and she gasped for air right before she let out a soft wail of a sob, collapsing forward as her face fell to her arms as they folded on the desk. Her body wracked with her crying as she tried to grasp that this was her reality, that this was something she had done all on her own from nearly start to finish. She'd reached out to other academics for pointers and advice on occasion, but overall, this was her third child when it came down to it.
    </p>
<p>
     Behind her, Agatha had jolted awake at the sound of her partner crying and sat up in a panic. All she could see was Rio hunched over that desk, shaking as she cried.
    </p>
<p>
     In an instant, Rio could hear as Agatha beelined it across that room before she dropped down into a squat, her hand landing on Rio's back.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "My love, what's wrong?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Rio seemed to cry harder. She had just managed what she had started to think was impossible and she couldn't wrangle in her emotions to express that to the person she loved most in the world.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Baby..."
     </i>
     Agatha leaned forward, pressing her lips to the closest part of Rio's arm she could reach.
     <i>
      "Come on, I think you should give it up for the night. It's not worth this kind of stress..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It took her another moment but Rio began to calm. She lifted her head, cheeks still wet, but she shook it when she looked over at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's not like that, my love,"
     </i>
     Rio whispered to her, reaching a hand up to brush at Agatha's cheek with her thumb.
     <i>
      "Look."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio turned back to the laptop and pressed the key again. Once more, the drone lifted and hovered in place in the exact same way it had before. Rio was staring at it again, but this time there was a grin as wide and bright as the moon on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     She'd done that. She'd made that happen.
    </p>
<p>
     With another tap on the key, the drone dropped again and it was almost more overwhelming than the first time.
    </p>
<p>
     It nearly took her out, then, to turn back to Agatha and see
     <i>
      that
     </i>
     kind of look on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was quiet, the complete wonder shining in her eyes in the dim light of the room.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio... Is that...?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio understood the question and she gave a nod in response.
    </p>
<p>
     Without a second's hesitation, Agatha's hand reached up and hooked around the back of Rio's neck, pulling her down to meet her in a warm and proud kiss that was overflowing with nothing but the warmest love.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it, could sense exactly what Agatha was trying to tell her, could hear it loud and clear.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time she started to taste salt, Rio couldn't have guessed if it was because of her or because of Agatha. What she didn't realize was that they were both crying.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled away, but she didn't go anywhere and instead pressed their foreheads together.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Rio Vidal, I am so fucking proud of you,"
     </i>
     Agatha told her in a soft breath.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to say something, to put what she was feeling into words but it felt impossible. She'd tried so hard to keep the faith, even if sometimes she had started to slip. She'd lost sleep some nights over feeling like her work would never end up in what she needed it to be.
    </p>
<p>
     And there she sat, proof that she could make anything happen that she wanted to.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pushed herself to full height, but slid her hand beneath Rio's chin to tilt her head up so that their gazes could meet.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm going to the cellar for a bottle of champagne. When you can, meet me in the bedroom, okay?"
     </i>
     Agatha asked in the softest murmur. She leaned down but it was to press her lips to Rio's forehead, leaving them there for a long moment before she stood. As she passed by Rio, Agatha gave her shoulder a soft squeeze and departed for the cellar, still naked and probably thankful that the kids had not come home.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio regained her faculties, her eyes dropped to her phone and she considered the same thing.
    </p>
<p>
     The elation was still bubbling in Rio, but there was something there beneath the surface. It was something hotter, something that raged with more intensity.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      It was power.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     She picked her phone up off of the desk and pulled up her message thread with Estee. All she sent was three prohibition sign emojis and said a prayer that it was clear enough. They had keys to the houseboat. They would be fine.
    </p>
<p>
     After another breath and one last glance at her brain child as it sat in its cradle, Rio got to her feet. She reached down and closed the laptop before turning toward the door and starting her journey to their bedroom, phone forgotten on the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     Once the shock of it all had completely left her, Rio felt like she was going to shake right out of her skin if she didn't find a way to busy herself. She needed to focus all of this newly available energy somewhere, and fast, or she felt as though she might combust.
    </p>
<p>
     This had to be painfully apparent as Agatha reappeared in the doorway to see Rio pacing back and forth across the length of their bed. Her eyes lifted and caught sight of Agatha, stopping in her tracks as her lips pressed together.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hi,"
     </i>
     Rio said, a small smile pushing up her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hi, my genius. Do you think you can drink this champagne without spilling it everywhere?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Without speaking, Rio answered by nodding her head.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Sit, baby,"
     </i>
     Agatha instructed as she paced over to Rio's nightstand to go about preparing their flutes. Once finished, she pulled one into each hand and moved to sit next to Rio on the bed, handing one over to her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I get to make this toast,"
     </i>
     Agatha announced quietly, crossing her left arm in front of her to hold her glass up. She kissed Rio on the cheek before she began.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "To chasing your dreams and never stopping until you achieve them. To never giving up and never slowing down. To you, my big-brained, beautiful, compassionate love. You deserve all that comes of this and I could not be more proud of you even if I tried."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     While normally, those were all sentiments that could have brought tears to Rio's eyes, it was not something that happened in that moment. No, instead, Rio leaned in and kissed Agatha softly before she spoke, too.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "And to you, my future wife, for fucking me into an epiphany."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's grin was wide and instant and there was a crackle of lightning in those blue eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     They clinked their glasses and tossed back half of the champagne, but they seemed to be of mutual mind as Agatha handed her flute over to Rio so that she could set them down on the table.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still buzzing. She was buzzing like that damn drone.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes swept up the length of Agatha's body from her knees, over her body, and they finally landed in those beautiful blue pools once more.
    </p>
<p>
     Without another word, Rio reached forward and took hold of Agatha's neck, pulling her in so that she could kiss her, their lips crushing with the force Rio had imbued upon her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt like a wild animal. Her heart had hardly stopped hammering and she was absolutely high off of the thrill of what she had accomplished. She was thrumming with the power of what it was to revolutionize a side of technology that had only been slowly progressing in recent times. This was huge and Rio knew it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did too.
    </p>
<p>
     It hadn't been long into the kiss that Rio's hand raised to land on Agatha's far breast, palming and kneading  before it started to travel. As it made it to Agatha's hip, their lips parted as a result of the way Agatha cocked her head back.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "This is your night, Rio,"
     </i>
     Agatha whispered, her eyes darting across Rio's face.
     <i>
      "Tell me what you want to do with it."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio licked her lips, eyes filling with wildfire. Agatha didn't want to ask her that.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'm not sure you want to hear that answer,"
     </i>
     Rio finally forced out, her dry throat warping the sound of the words as they left her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her again for the longest second.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Tell me."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Still vibrating, Rio dug her teeth hard into her bottom lip.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I want to fuck you, Agatha."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At first, it didn't quite hit the mark she was aiming for, but then after the brief moment it took to process, Agatha's shock registered in the blink of an eye.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You mean...?"
     </i>
     Agatha breathed, her eyes searching Rio's face for any sense that she did not mean what she had just implied.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I want you to take all of me I can give you, Agatha. I want to fuck you proper."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The longer Rio went on, the deeper the shades of red became on Agatha's cheeks and bare chest. By the time she had finished speaking, Agatha looked like she was fighting herself on reaching between her own legs at hearing Rio make such a bold declaration in a way that she might not have under any other circumstance.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I think I would quite like that,"
     </i>
     Agatha offered in response, her voice low and gravelly at the way she felt void of any moisture in her throat and mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     At that answer, Rio smashed their lips together in a passionate show of just how badly she wanted to ravage Agatha. She wanted to lay into her in a way that she had never felt before in her life and it was damn near driving her insane. All she could do was kiss the woman she loved as hard as she could manage, tongues battling and teeth clicking and catching the skin of lips in their frenzy.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha snapped into intentional motion and stripped Rio down for the second time that day, but she did not hesitate to take her shorts and underwear off, too. Both of Agatha's hands raised to cradle either side of Rio's jaw to pull her in for one more kiss before they managed to separate long enough for Agatha to nod her head, indicating her desire for Rio to climb atop the bed. Rio heeded the request.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha made her way around to the other side of the bed and opened her drawer, pulling out that familiar purple dildo and a small bottle of lube before she, too, crawled onto the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     For as awkward as Rio might have ever considered that moment could ever be, the way they both moved about in preparation was almost like a well choreographed dance. As Rio found herself adjusting to the slight stretch caused by the hilt of the prosthetic, she looked over toward Agatha who was watching the way Rio's hand was working the lube over the length of the phallus between her legs.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could have goaded her, could have asked her how it made her feel but she didn't need to when she could see it just how deep that appetite was in Agatha's electric blue eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was shifting, landing on her hands and knees in front of Agatha, their faces level with how Agatha was propped against the pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     One of Rio's hands snapped up and hooked strongly along the bottom of Agatha's face so that she could steal one more crushing kiss that lasted only long enough to segue into what Rio was about to ask.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I want to fuck you from behind,"
     </i>
     Rio growled right before she caught Agatha's bottom lip between her teeth and gave it a rough tug before releasing it.
    </p>
<p>
     For as much as Rio had thought that Agatha might show resistance, she was facing none of it. Agatha moved obediently after one more stolen kiss and they rearranged their positions on the bed. As Agatha placed herself on all fours, Rio moved forward and leaned over her, hooking an arm around Agatha's middle as she placed a few kisses along the left half of her back, feeling as the silicone appendage pressed between herself and the left cheek of Agatha's ass.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha felt it too; she let Rio know this by the low and breathy moan she exhaled followed by her hips shifting back in silent demand.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her way down Agatha's back before she straightened up, both of her hands falling to each of Agatha's hips, fingertips sinking like anchors. She gave a squeeze before one hold lifted to wrap around the appendage between her legs so that she could offer a guide as she pressed inside Agatha's slick heat.
    </p>
<p>
     There before her, Agatha's head whipped back and she let out something that was almost a scream but registered a little lower in a loud moan as the initial rip of pleasure coursed through her. Rio was slow, she was gentle, she was attentive to every bit of Agatha's body she could see and touch. This was new, and she was drunk on power at this point, but there was still care to be had when handling the woman she loved.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, she pressed her hips closer but was measured in her lack of pace. There was no hurry here, no rush to get this over with as soon as possible. No, Rio absolutely wanted to savor every second of what she had in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     There was an inherent beauty in the scape of Agatha's bare back spread out before her that Rio thought to be one of the most beautiful things she had been able to witness in her entire life. It looked even better as she placed a hand to the center of Agatha's back, lower down, so that she could take the moment to adapt to the learning curve, here.
    </p>
<p>
     This had been something Rio had only thought about in theory and now that she had to put it to practice, she was just letting instinct take over.
    </p>
<p>
     It began as a gentle rhythm, a back and forth that Rio was hyperaware of both because of the feeling it was pulling in her own core, but also because she was watching as every languid stroke landed everywhere else in Agatha's body. She was holding herself up but Rio did not miss the way her arms buckled, giving the slightest bit before Agatha recovered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was calculating, she was assessing the situation and while she had determined that what she was doing was working, her bravery won out in a move of impulsivity that almost startled even herself, and surely caught Agatha off guard.
    </p>
<p>
     One of Rio's hands lifted from Agatha's hip and reached forward, wrapping snugly in her hair as she gave a pull, forcing Agatha's head up and then back. The moment the move was executed, a reverberating moan hurled itself from the depths of Agatha's lungs. Another one followed as Rio's pace picked up the slightest bit.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was there, on her throne, and the view was phenomenal.
    </p>
<p>
     That high she'd been riding around on was only about to get even better.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave another firm tug on Agatha's hair and with the way Agatha nearly gasped her name in response?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wanted to see and feel Agatha come undone like that before her in more pleasure than she thought she might be able to handle. She leaned forward enough that she could remove the remaining hand from Agatha's hip, but only to slide forward over the haunch. Her touch wasted no time in seeking out Agatha's clit. She was managing to keep that rhythm but Rio knew that she herself was toeing a very precarious line.
    </p>
<p>
     They had reached the point, apparently, where every move Rio made produced a whimper or whine from Agatha's lips. Every thrust, every brush of those nerves was pushing her closer and closer to that edge. Unintentionally, Rio shifted slightly and gave a tug on Agatha's hair that had not been calculated. As she did so, though, she felt Agatha slam her hips back, wet sex taking Rio in as far as she could manage as her body began to shake there in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could see where every single muscle tensed and released in rapid succession. It was such a sight to behold that even though Rio had not quite been able to dive off the cliff at first, she was thrust over the edge once she had the time to process the rawness and beauty of it. Then, like an echo of a moment that became a full shout, Rio got hers, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Gingerly, Rio pulled her hips back, the appendage sliding out of Agatha's body and in the moment, Rio was so concerned with tending to Agatha that she pulled it from her own body, only shivering slightly with the ripple of orgasm that remained before she tossed it aside, trying not to giggle as it hit the ground with a thud.
    </p>
<p>
     She was back behind Agatha in an instant but then shifted to her side. Rio ran a soothing hand up the length of Agatha's spine and kissed her shoulder blade tenderly.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Lay down, my love,"
     </i>
     Rio coaxed in a murmur against skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Still panting, Agatha listened and lowered herself shakily to the bed, cheek pressed to the pillow in a way that enabled her to see as Rio laid down, half on top of her, so that their faces were only a few inches apart.
    </p>
<p>
     They just watched each other in silent appreciation for a long few moments before Agatha proved to be the first to find her voice.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What the fuck was that?"
     </i>
     she demanded, though an airy laugh passed through her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "What do you mean?!"
     </i>
     Rio hiked in whispered tones, brows arching in feigned innocence.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're telling me that you've known how to do
      <b>
       that
      </b>
      all this time and I've been too nervous to let you? What the hell is wrong with me?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio immediately dissolved into giggles and lifted slightly so that she could lean forward to give Agatha a chaste kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Nothing's wrong with you, my love. You just learn new things every day."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The next morning, after a much needed shower together, Agatha had decided to take her weekly trip to see the farmer she'd made friends with and Rio had let her go with a soft kiss and an insistence that she had a book she could surely tend to. Agatha had made a comment about her wearing her glasses, to which Rio had simply stated only if she could borrow Agatha's. It had earned her a pointed glare right before Agatha had told her she loved her and walked out the door.
    </p>
<p>
     An hour later, Rio sat on the couch in the living area, legs crossed beneath her as she hunched over the book in her lap. She was truly immersed in the story before her when she heard the soft clinking of metal pots and pans behind her and lifted her head to see Nicky in the kitchen rummaging through cabinets.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mijo?" she called to him. "What are you looking for?"
    </p>
<p>
     "¿Has visto la licuadora? Quiero un licuado."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, it's --" Rio caught herself mid-response as the auditory echo of the moment replayed in her head. Her brow pinched tight and she was staring a hole directly into him.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Nicky... ¿Qué dices?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could see it on his face as he was actively fighting to keep the smile from gracing his expression.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Pregunté... ¿Donde está la licuadora?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at him.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Nicholas... How..."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At this point, there was no use trying to hide his giddy grin.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "How else, mama?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh, that daughter of mine is in big trouble."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Nicky's grin grew wild and wicked, the lights dancing in his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I don't think that she's going to be in as much trouble as you are when mom comes home and you realize that I'm not the only one who's been taking lessons."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Rio's jaw dropped and her eyes went wide.
    </p>
<p>
     He was right. Rio was in big trouble.

<p>
     The day had finally arrived.
    </p>
<p>
     The five -- technically six because Hēmi had joined as well -- members of the Harkness-Vidal family had touched down in Los Angeles earlier in the week, met with a warm and vibrant LA spring.
    </p>
<p>
     In a move that Rio learned Agatha had not known about, Jack, Thea, as well as the man Agatha introduced as Walker, had met them at the private airstrip where The Hoatzin had landed a little ways outside of Malibu.
    </p>
<p>
     Walker stepped forward toward Rio, holding his arms out in an unasked question. She grinned and walked toward him, taking the embrace.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are very quickly becoming a fan favorite in our home," he told her with a gentle chuckle as they separated. "Jack and Thea have had nothing but the highest praises to sing. I know that there are a couple of heads in my household that have been excited about this since your dinner together."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel the blush on her cheeks; realizing that she was the topic of discussion in a home filled with powerful and talented people did something to her in a way that could prove in no other showing than that pink dust on her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio might have doubted her own ability to be completely enchanting, but Agatha did not.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew what and who Rio was in this world and never doubted it. Getting to see her integrate further into Agatha's life was a joy that perhaps Rio may never understand the gravity of.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon seeing their welcoming committee, the girls had both completely lost their minds while Nicky had simply met Jack with some concocted secret handshake that had made Rio chuckle from the distance between them.
    </p>
<p>
     Watching as Thea pulled Estee into a hug was quite a sight, given the way Estee looked like she was so excited she was going to either cry or vibrate out of her skin. It was both sweet and beautiful in the fact that it was like watching more pieces of the puzzle of their lives as they fell into exactly the right places.
    </p>
<p>
     Departing the runway had meant taking the girls to a new home that belonged to them, too. When they arrived, Rio had been completely floored as Agatha showed the girls their room, that she'd apparently put Dave to work. The room had been painted a pastel teal color -- Estee's favorite -- and there were several sweet touches across it. On one of the white nightstands, there was a succulent plant and two picture frames.
    </p>
<p>
     In one, it was a photo Nicky had taken of Estee and Tay on the beach. They were wrapped around each other, clearly in a state of laughter as the sun sank over the vast ocean behind them. It was so, so sweet.
    </p>
<p>
     In the other, it was a photo Rio had never seen before. It was herself and Estee; Estee's head was tilted up and she was looking at something out of frame. Next to her, Rio was looking at her daughter with the love and pride only a mother could have for her child. It had almost made Rio cry, but she had stuffed it down.
    </p>
<p>
     Tay's nightstand looked similar with a little philodendron that sat between two photos, as well. The one of the two girls there had been one that Rio knew to have been taken by Agatha. They had been out at dinner one night and Tay had leaned in to whisper in Estee's ear with a smile on her face so big it nearly let off a glare in the camera lens. The other, it was all five of them, but it was a photo Nicky had used his tripod for. Tay had run to make sure it was working correctly and as she tried to sprint back, the photo had snapped. As a result, Rio, Agatha, Nicky, and Estee were all mid-laughter and Tay's back was visible, some of the sand she was kicking up catching in the light.
    </p>
<p>
     It was their brand of chaos.
    </p>
<p>
     As the weight of it all truly landed, the girls both turned and nearly threw themselves at Agatha, who only staggered slightly as she caught them.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's perfect, Agatha," Estee had nearly squealed into her neck, hugging her tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "It really is. Thank you," Tay added. The emotion in both of their voices had been strong, enough to give Rio a good thump in the middle of her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     "I owe most of the credit to Dave. He did all of the leg work." Agatha's voice was warm, but the appreciation was there. "Obviously, you don't have to live here forever and we are of the understanding that you will eventually want your own home, but you'll always have somewhere to fall back to if you ever need it. It's yours forever."
    </p>
<p>
     Another thump, square in the center, nearly cracking Rio's sternum in a way that made her eyes sting with tears. Those tears only fell as she looked up at Agatha who's expression resembled melted ice on a summer's day as she clung to the girls.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's girls.
    </p>
<p>
     Now they were Agatha's girls, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Every single time that realization struck Rio with force, it was almost disorienting.
    </p>
<p>
     While the days following had been filled with last minute trips and errands, they'd made time to go over to the Landon mansion in order to properly make introductions to the entire outfit. It had been intense in the best way. Learning everyone's names was going to take Rio a couple of days but she knew that with the more time they all spent together, it was going to get easier.
    </p>
<p>
     As a family, the Landons were absolutely formidable. As individuals, each and every single one of them was a work of art. They had their own niches, fell into their own careers, and they had become spectacular humans in the process.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's favorite part about that night in particular had been watching as Estee engaged in conversation with Cole, a meeting of minds that had been called by Thea that night at dinner those weeks ago. They were both lit up and holding a very clear dialogue that was bouncing back and forth, and judging by the hand motions and moments of pause for thought, Rio could tell they were talking shop in regards to psychology.
    </p>
<p>
     There were other moments that Rio locked in her mind, too.
    </p>
<p>
     There was the way Agatha had stood with her arm slung around Nicky's shoulder and Hēmi held his opposite hand as they shared wine on the back deck in conversation and Rio had returned from the washroom to behold the sight.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the way Rio had sidled up to Nicky and tilted her head to lay against the side of his shoulder as they bathed in the light of the setting sun.
    </p>
<p>
     There was the way that Tay and Rianne talked about wanting to travel and see more of the world, which had included an off-handed invitation from Rianne that they come see Paris, where her boyfriend was from, some time.
    </p>
<p>
     It was also in the way that, as Rio had stood back to consume the sheer chaos, the Landon matriarch, Adam, sidled up to her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know it's a lot," she'd said, tilting her head up toward Rio a bit. "But... After the twelve texts I got the night you an Agatha met Thea and Jack for dinner, this moment in the making has been a very justifiable cause for buzz in this home."
    </p>
<p>
     That made Rio smile so hard her face ached.
    </p>
<p>
     When they had departed that evening, their goodbyes had taken almost twenty-five minutes. It was almost comical, really, the way everyone made sure to get a hug from every occupant in the room they did not already live with. It was beautifully chaotic in the most pure way that Rio realized she had ever experienced.
    </p>
<p>
     Time pressed on, and finalizing everything that last day before the actual wedding had been almost nerve-wracking. By the time Agatha and Rio were being pulled to different hotel rooms in the middle of the hallway in the Morongo Casino, Rio was more than a little pained at the idea of not getting to sleep in a bed next to Agatha, even if she was just in the next room over.
    </p>
<p>
     Luckily, they had adjoining balconies, too, with a divider between them that Rio had pointed out to Estee could allow her to at least talk to Agatha if they really did want to stay separated.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew that they had done away with the majority of typical traditions when it came to this wedding. However, they had both made the decision that this tradition, the one that would build up the anticipation right until that moment when they got to see each other for the first time in that venue, would be well worth it.
    </p>
<p>
     They had ordered room service from the restaurant on the 27th floor, and while the food looked amazing and it did taste pretty good, there was this small irritation that Rio could not shake as she pushed it around. She knew it was unfounded, and that it was only because it was the first time since Agatha had come home from LA after dealing with her mother that they'd been separated.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't that Rio was actually upset, it was just... hard to be so close and yet, feel so far away.
    </p>
<p>
     This had been remedied by 8:30pm. Rio had gone outside to catch some fresh air and just gaze out into the valley, but Estee had been quick in action as she texted her brother that Rio had gone outside.
    </p>
<p>
     Not a moment later, Rio heard the glass door slide open on the other side of the divider to her right. Her breath snagged in the middle of her throat and even though she knew she could not see, her head stilled turned as she found her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "My love, is that you?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio swore she could hear the way Agatha smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's me, baby," Agatha returned and Rio was very aware of the sudden uptick in her heartbeat.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shifted, sliding over so that she could press the side of her body to that divider, a silent and unwitnessed move to just be a little closer to Agatha. She leaned forward, her forearms bracing on the railing of the balcony as her hands dangled, desperate for purchase on any bit of the woman she loved that she could have gotten to.
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately, without verbalizing the thought, she got it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned forward, too, on the other side of that divider and the moment she'd seen Rio's hand, empty and hanging, she'd wrapped her fingers around it and gave it a firm squeeze. The act alone made Rio wanted to burst into tears but she managed to quell the urge, forcing it down with a slow and deep breath.
    </p>
<p>
     "I miss you," Rio admitted, her lips turning down at the corners as she anxiously toyed with Agatha's fingers, feeling like she could have simply hoisted herself over that railing and made a daring leap to the other side to just put an end to it, but it truly wasn't so unbearable. Rio knew, deep down, that it was irrational to feel that way and that she should probably seek help when dealing with it in the long term, but it was the circumstances that had her antsy.
    </p>
<p>
     Yes, it was one night apart and she would survive it. It was also the third biggest night of her life to date and the first that was exclusively in relation to how much she loved Agatha. Rio knew the next night would take its place, but right then as they stood on that balcony holding hands around the divider between them, it felt like scaling a mountain.
    </p>
<p>
     Tomorrow was going to be an impossibly big day, not in terms of size or grandeur, but because it was their chance to show the people they cared about how much Rio and Agatha
     <i>
      also
     </i>
     cared for one another. It was an opportunity to stand in front of people that loved them and openly devote the rest of their lives to each other.
    </p>
<p>
     Even more than that, though, it was a chance for them to prove it to one another. They'd made all of these choices together, had come this far, and now it was nothing more than a waiting game for them to get to the finish line. It was a waiting game that involved separation, though, and while it wasn't unmanageable, there was still the tiniest ache in Rio's chest that compelled her to throw it all out the window and fit herself into Agatha's arms.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, their fingers wound together like that, Rio knew that waiting would be worth it, no matter how much she detested it in the meantime.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was a rational human being the majority of the time and rationally, she got it. She completely understood the concept and respected what it meant and what it instilled.
    </p>
<p>
     The fact that the next time she got to see Agatha, she would be wearing the gown that Rio had picked out for her, it was enough to make her forget how to breathe for the briefest moment.
    </p>
<p>
     The next time she saw Agatha, Rio would be in whatever suit Agatha had procured for her. She would also be standing on that platform as Agatha was brought to her in the back of a fucking
     <i>
      horse drawn carriage.
     </i>
     That was a bit of minutia that Rio was still a little hung up on. How insane was that? It was like it had been ripped straight out of some children's nighttime story.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was going to get her queen, and she was going to have her for good.
    </p>
<p>
     To do that, she had to get herself through the night before them, first.
    </p>
<p>
     "I miss you too, Rio," Agatha returned a couple of moments later, though their hands had not stopped fidgeting with one another since Rio had spoken.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio breathed a gentle sigh through her nose, letting her eyes fall shut as her head hung slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know this is like... part of the thrill and all, but I can't stop thinking about how stupid it is that you're literally right next door and I have to fall asleep without you." Rio's voice wasn't sad, but it was low and had the smallest little edge to it that she could not hide.
    </p>
<p>
     She could hear Agatha breath a soft laugh, the pad of Agatha's thumb running over the backs of Rio's knuckles.
    </p>
<p>
     "That might be so, but... You have two very affectionate and very sweet girls who would love to surround you in my place." Agatha always knew, always had faith, that Rio's biggest support in her life would always be Estee, no matter what happened. Everything else could come and go, but Agatha had always recognized and respected that Estrella Vidal would always be Rio's reason for all that she did. Agatha also knew that it was a mutual feeling and that Estee loved her mother more than she knew how to tell her.
    </p>
<p>
     That much had been clear in the photo Agatha had captured and the way the next day after seeing it, Estee had put one of the flowers Rio had pressed for her as a little girl in the corner of the frame.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, admittedly I think I got the better end of the deal," Rio admitted with a soft giggle, glancing down at their hands. "You got stuck with the stinky boys."
    </p>
<p>
     In only a breath, Agatha began to laugh too.
    </p>
<p>
     "I told them they were absolutely showering before bed -- separately," Agatha poked back, her voice light with amusement. "And again when they wake up."
    </p>
<p>
     The softest giggle passed through Rio's lips as she gave Agatha's hand a gentle squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     "We really are pretty lucky, aren't we?" Rio posed softly. "We have amazing kids, your friends are so supportive and kind, Dave is literally
     <i>
      the man,
     </i>
     and I... All of that is even before I take into consideration what it means to us to have each other."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grip on her fingers tightened and Rio could hear the breath she pulled in, slow and stead.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're right, we are. And this life we have managed to build together still stuns me every morning when I open my eyes. Sometimes, you're there and sometimes I can smell that you're working in the kitchen even though that's
     <i>
      my
     </i>
     domain," Agatha murmured at her, a gentle cajoling.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes were locked on their hands, the only part of Agatha she could see, even if the sound of her voice felt like a warm blanket on a cool night as it carried over the space forced between them.
    </p>
<p>
     "And sometimes, I'm laying in the yard looking at the stars because I wonder how in a world so big, I managed to find the perfect person for me." Rio's lips twitched upward, wanting nothing more than to throw herself in the arms of the woman who's hand she was holding in that moment.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know, I can still get you that telescope..." Agatha mused and this actually did get Rio to grin.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Rio chastised. "You are not buying me a four thousand dollar telescope to put in our backyard."
    </p>
<p>
     "But your birthday
     <i>
      is
     </i>
     next month..."
    </p>
<p>
     "And I don't
     <i>
      need
     </i>
     a stupid expensive telescope as a monument of getting another year older." Rio's voice was soft, but it still held an admonishing edge to it.
    </p>
<p>
     "But what if I wanted to get it so it would be easier for when you teach me about constellations? I mean, the quality would be so much help." That little twinge in Agatha's tone, it told Rio that she did mean it, but she meant it for other reasons, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha liked giving things to Rio that made her happy. That could be as simple as a telescope, or she had also proven that it could be as grand as a massive house for them to cohabitate in. It was anything Agatha could get her hands on that she knew could improve Rio's quality of life.
    </p>
<p>
     Whatever it was in the world that Rio could ever want or need, Agatha had always made it apparent that she would provide.
    </p>
<p>
     "If I tell you no, you're probably going to do it anyway," Rio pointed out, her smile audible in her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're... probably not wrong?" Agatha returned, though by the end of it, she was laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     "When am I ever?" Rio asked, fighting the urge to lean far enough forward that she could look over and see the smile she knew Agatha was wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rarely, but it happens. You know, like the time you told me that you were too tired for morning sex. Turns out, you were
     <i>
      super
     </i>
     wrong about that."
    </p>
<p>
     Instantly, they were both laughing. Agatha had a fair point there, Rio would admit.
    </p>
<p>
     As that laughter ebbed away, there was a smooth silence that covered them, gracing every bit of the space around them as Rio's gaze lifted from their hands and cast out toward the valley.
    </p>
<p>
     Another moment and Rio parted her lips to speak.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn't been expecting to harmonize with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you, Agatha."
      <br/>
      "I love you, Rio."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It shouldn't have, but it caused tears to spring and spill down Rio's cheeks as her head tipped forward and a ghost of a chuckle hit the air around her. She had been convinced it had been quiet enough that Agatha couldn't hear it, but she questioned that the moment Agatha spoke.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "You're crying, aren't you?"
     </i>
     she posed softly, squeezing Rio's hand firmly.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Of course. How did you know?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      "Because that got a couple of tears out of me, too."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     They had been situated like that for another twenty or so minutes before Agatha made the suggestion that if they sat with their backs to the wall and close enough to the barred railing, they would still be able to hold hands.
    </p>
<p>
     So they had sat, for hours as the night fell darkly around them, just talking about their lives, about their dreams, about their hopes for their futures. They talked about nights on the beach with a fire, they talked about the possibility of getting to be grandmothers some day. They talked about their children, their children's partners, the love they all shared. Even Hēmi seemed to fit so perfectly into their little puzzle, and they talked about how much they loved him, too.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, they talked about their past. That was a little bit more of an emotional conversation than anything else up to that point had been. They'd already covered almost all there was to know about those beginnings, but just taking that trip down memory lane had been something Rio had not known she'd needed until she had it. And they kept going like that, just a soft back and forth in the middle of the Morongo valley that only they could hear.
    </p>
<p>
     At some point, Rio had been the first to doze. She'd fallen asleep with her fingers still hooked into Agatha's as their hands had fallen to a resting position against the concrete of the balcony beneath them. Agatha had submitted to slumber not moments later.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was not sure how long it had been between the last conversation she'd had with Agatha and the moment when Estee shook her awake and coaxed her to come climb into bed with her and Tay. Rio was immediately aware that Agatha's hand was no longer in her own. It took a second of panic for Estee to reach out and touch her shoulder from the position she held as she was squatted down in front of Rio.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Nicky woke her up and she wouldn't move. He got Hēmi to put her in bed. He said it was very fireman-carry-esque and that she also whined the whole time, asking for you."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's sleepy expression melted and it took Estee another tug of encouragement to get her to her feet. She'd changed into a pair of shorts to sleep in and had crawled into that big bed, snuggling right between two of her three children. They enveloped her almost immediately, arms wrapping in calculated ways to smother Rio in what love they had to offer, knowing it was all they could do.
    </p>
<p>
     It had taken her little time to fall asleep to the sounds of their breathing and the smell of their perfumes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio loved Agatha, that was an immovable fact.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio also loved her children more than she knew how to express, especially as she had drifted off to time travel to the next morning.
    </p>
<p>
     The sun came up and six pairs of eyes opened at intervals in different rooms to greet the day.
    </p>
<p>
     The coordination that the children had displayed in getting the two women to the venue that morning, separately, had been quite a feat but it had left Rio entirely impressed.
    </p>
<p>
     As she tried to help the girls load everything she would need that day inside, they had simply waved her off and insisted they could take care of it.
    </p>
<p>
     It was only minutes later as the girls carried in the three garment bags and hung them in the hutch along the far wall of the room they would be spending the morning in.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had perched in that chair nursing her coffee as they waited for the stylist to arrive, but the moment that Estee and Tay unzipped their garment bags to reveal their bridesmaid's dresses, Rio could feel the emotion welling in her chest. This had only been kept from Rio due to the fact that they were going to be matching her suit that she had been told she was not allowed to open until stated.
    </p>
<p>
     In turn, while Rio had opted to keep the boys' suits black, she had not been able to keep from inserting her input on the lavender ties they would be wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     The dresses were a gorgeous pastel green color and the shape of them was nearly to die for. Rio knew they would look even better once the girls got them on, but just the sight of them had Rio ready to start shedding tears left and right.
    </p>
<p>
     Once they were done showcasing their own attire, Estee hooked a finger beneath the curve of Rio's hanger and lifted the bag out, moving to stand in front of Rio so that she could hold the bag in a way that allowed Rio to unzip it.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment she did and pushed the sides of the bag away enough to reveal what was inside, Rio could feel tears spring instantly to her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Within that bag was an absolutely stunning velvet suit, hunter green in color. The sleeves were cuffed and cinched near the elbows, as well as the waist. The lapel ran high but curved in sharply in a very striking way. There were even a couple of flat pockets toward the bottom of the jacket. The pants were long and flowing, a bit of a contrast to the jacket.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio realized next made her smirk and curse Agatha in the same moment.
    </p>
<p>
     There was nothing else there, nothing that was going to go beneath that jacket in any kind of a blouse or camisole. With the cut of the neckline that was going to be created by the buttoning of the jacket, Rio calculated that it would conclude in a sharp point somewhere just below her sternum.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "It's incredible,"
     </i>
     Rio managed, fingertips trembling as they touched at her lips, the overwhelming urge to run down that hall and kiss the woman she loved starting to swallow her whole.
    </p>
<p>
     "We thought so, too. But this made every moment of keeping it from you
     <i>
      so
     </i>
     worth it." Estee's voice was so warm, so rich in its honesty that Rio could have cried even more.
    </p>
<p>
     She took another moment to collect herself, finding a composition she was unaware she had and took a deep breath.
    </p>
<p>
     That was until Tay turned around with a white box in her hand, roughly about 1x1 foot in size.
    </p>
<p>
     "We did a trade off with Nicky when we took him the pendant. She got this to complete your ensemble." Tay's voice was so sweet and Rio could hear how clearly she adored this exchange and everything it symbolized.
    </p>
<p>
     "Open it, mama," Estee pressed and Rio stepped forward to do just that, both hands raising to open the lid of the box.
    </p>
<p>
     There, nestled in black velvet was a thin crown of silver vines, one that bore leaves of diamonds along its entirety. The suit was incredible; there was no denying that. But that piece of adornment that Agatha had very clearly sunk all of her intention into choosing?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's face crumpled and she clasped a hand over her mouth to stifle the sound of the sob that leapt out of her, though she wasn't incredibly successful. Every inch of her wanted to take off, to scour every room in that building until she could find Agatha and give her a kiss that could somehow tell her just how much Rio loved her in those moments.
    </p>
<p>
     Apparently, she was not the only one who had such an idea.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's phone dinged and she looked at it the next second, though her eyes grew wide and she reached out to grab hold of Tay's hand, pulling her over to the door as they pressed their backs to it in the form of a brace.
    </p>
<p>
     The text from Nicky simply read: "INCOMING!"
    </p>
<p>
     It took only another beat before Rio could hear the commotion out in the hallway, though it wasn't incredibly close.
    </p>
<p>
     Hēmi's voice carried right down the hall with how deep it was.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm sorry, Ms. Harkness." A second later, Agatha exhaled a grunt and then a very loud growl.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hēmi! Hēmi put me down right this instant!" Agatha's voice was little more than a screech and Rio knew she was angry, but it was the sweetest thing.
    </p>
<p>
     "No can do, Ms. Harkness. You know the rules," he informed her. The fact that the three of them were stood there just listening felt like an added layer to the comedic weight of the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     "I do not give a single solitary fuck about rules! I want to see her!" Agatha was shouting and while not one of the three women in that room could see what was going on, it was pretty easy to paint a visual.
    </p>
<p>
     "For everyone's benefit, you cannot see her until the ceremony."
    </p>
<p>
     This caused the three women locked into the room to fall prey to a fit of giggles, though the moment was not quite over yet.
    </p>
<p>
     "What the hell does that even mean?!" Agatha cried, the struggle in Hēmi's grasp so laden in her tone.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, it was Nicky's voice that carried down the hall, though the volume was decreasing as they got further away.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because you know that you'll kick everyone else out and we won't make it to the ceremony."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was grinning so hard that she thought her face might crack. Even further at what she swore she heard Hēmi say.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thanks, babe, I didn't wanna say it."
    </p>
<p>
     She fucking loved that woman.
    </p>
<p>
     And she was going to tell her as much in a few hours.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's phone dinged again and she brought it up, grinning the moment she read Nicky's message. She read it again, this time out loud.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nick said, 'I gave her the pendant. She moved faster than I could catch her.'" By the time she finished reading, Estee was in giggles, her eyes sweeping up to her mother's with a broad smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     It really
     <i>
      was
     </i>
     a beautiful piece of jewelry, and with the dress Rio had selected, that giant purple tear drop gem matched the cut of the diamond on the ring Rio had chosen to slide on Agatha's finger later on that day. Everything Rio had done in regards to this day had been so thoroughly calculated, so planned in a way only she would ever be able to manage.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was already beautiful, that was a known fact. The idea of Agatha dressed in what Rio had picked out for her as they announced their devotion to one another in front of a small crowd of people that loved them, that was beautiful, too.
    </p>
<p>
     However, there was something
     <i>
      so much more
     </i>
     beautiful about the way Rio could still hear Agatha's hollering as Hēmi hauled her back down the hallway to her appropriate room.
    </p>
<p>
     A moment later, there was a soft tap on the door. The girls, who were still pressed against it, glanced at one another but did not move.
    </p>
<p>
     "That has to be Nicky. You're Nicky right?!" Estee called through the door over her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, Estee, it's me. Lemme in."
    </p>
<p>
     The girls released their brace on the door and Estee reached down to pull it open, revealing a grinning Nicky on the other side of it. He stepped inside, his eyes lifting to Rio. His smile only seemed to grow.
    </p>
<p>
     "You really got her with the necklace," he told her, tilting his head sweetly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, well, turns out bringing Hēmi has many uses. And also, something about the way he just manhandled your mother makes me adore him even more. So, no pressure, but
     <i>
      try
     </i>
     to keep him around," Rio informed him with a gentle giggle.
    </p>
<p>
     "Dually noted," Nicky returned with a chuckle. "Well, I thought I would come down and explain that when she opened the box, she attempted to bully me for her phone. When she remembered that I'm too tall for her to reach an entire upright extension of my arm, she just looked me dead in the eyes for a solid three seconds and then bolted."
    </p>
<p>
     "Sounds on brand for mum, honestly," Estee voiced with a shrug as she paced back over to her bag to rummage through it, producing the chapstick she had been looking for.
    </p>
<p>
     "I also think it pertinent to mention that she's already asked four times how much longer and obviously the stylists have not even shown up yet," he tacked on, rolling his eyes in jest at his mother's antics.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well," Rio posed back, her cheeks pushing up in a broad smile. "Sounds to me like you boys are doing a
     <i>
      terrible
     </i>
     job of distracting her. The girls have been keeping my mind o--"
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, PLEASE!" Tay squealed, giving an eyeroll even more dramatically than Nicky had a moment ago. "You opened that crown and you were
     <i>
      so
     </i>
     ready to bolt."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's cheeks quickly flamed red at being called out so directly. She had thought that maybe she'd been able to keep it under wraps enough that neither of them had noticed, but Rio knew them both better than that.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know... you could at least give me
     <i>
      some
     </i>
     credit for not doing it?" Rio shot back, but the question was still heavy at the end of her words, as if she did not fully believe it herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama," Estee admonished, "That is literally only because she did it first and we had you trapped in here. The likelihood that you were getting through both of us before Hēmi had time to pull her away was slim and we all know it."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's brow pinched in a mock frown; she wasn't actually angry, but Estee was making a fair point.
    </p>
<p>
     This was something Rio and Agatha had decided on together. It was important, in its own silly way. It was a way to turn up the tension and anticipation, to make the wait of the day worth it when that moment finally happened and they got to see one another for the first time. This was also something they had clearly stated to all four of the younger adults that they really did want.
    </p>
<p>
     In that moment, they had all garnered quite a bit of respect from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     They had all listened and they had all played their part in making sure that the two of them, who
     <i>
      only
     </i>
     lacked reasonable self-restraint when it came to their relationship, got the request they had submitted.
    </p>
<p>
     Would it feel good in the moment to just get tangled in kisses and arms and sighs and whimpers? Of course, but the reality of it was that they had a very big, very important day ahead of them. They had photographers and videographers showing up in an hour, and the stylists were surely on their way as well. There were so many moving parts and pieces to this that it was imperative that they be kept on track.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio simply told herself that she could get through the next few hours, that she could sit there while her makeup was done and her hair was styled. She told herself that she was going to walk down that aisle and wait for the approach of the woman she could not have loved any more, in any way. They were going to exchange their vows and trade rings, then they were going to eat and drink with their loved ones. Once they wrapped that up, they got one more night in the hotel -- which, smartly, Agatha had gotten them a different room on a higher floor so the children could have the adjoining ones and also save their mental wellbeing -- and then they were rolling out of bed in the morning to climb back onto The Hoatzin once more to head to Iceland.
    </p>
<p>
     She could get through it, but it didn't make the entire situation any more believable even as she ran through it in her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     As she rooted herself in it and realized it for all that it was, Rio felt confident for the first time in saying that if Jack felt so inclined to ask once more about showing the world their lives, it didn't scare her like it once did.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio and Agatha had was magic.
    </p>
<p>
     It was human connection and the insatiable need to not let it get away.
    </p>
<p>
     It was just...
     <i>
      love,
     </i>
     in it's purest form.
    </p>
<p>
     That was what made it so beautiful.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze lifted to Nicky and a thought struck her. She paced over to her own bag and rummaged around, finding a half-crumpled list of everything they'd needed for the day. It was no longer needed, so she grabbed it and located a pen in one of the drawers of a desk in the room they were in. Flipping the paper over, Rio bit the cap of the pen and pulled it off, hunching over the desk.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio scribbled something down and then tore the corner of the page off, turning to face her son. She held it out, though to made no move to fold it in an attempt to hide the message.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Keep falling a little longer, my love. I'll be waiting to catch you.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio didn't conceal it because only Agatha would understand the words that
     <i>
      weren't
     </i>
     written on that paper.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would forever be her soft place to land. This time, the fall wasn't immediate into ocean water, it was a slow careening that would land her right in the arms of her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky glanced down at it and while he might not have understood the sentiment, he got it enough that the look he gave Rio when he looked back up at her was tender and soft. Rio raised a hand, giving his cheek a light brush with thumb.
    </p>
<p>
     "Keep her in line for a bit more, if you would. I know it's a task, but... She'll be thankful for it later." Rio adjusted her hold so that she could tip his head forward that enabled her to place a soft kiss to his forehead as she stood on the tips of her toes. Once she was level again, she let him go and gave him a gentle nod. "I am impossibly thankful for you, Nicholas. And Hēmi, too, if you could pass it along."
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, mama," he told her softly. Before he made his exit, though, he leaned toward her and wrapped her up in his arms, giving her a tight squeeze. When he pulled away and let her go, he was grinning again. "I'm just... happy to be here."
    </p>
<p>
     It was a light statement, but it dropped like a lead weight with the tone he used. It said all the things his words couldn't, the primary one being that this was a moment he had never thought he would experience in his life, given who his mother had tried for so long to be. All it took was a loud whistle and an aggressive and irritated cyclist and there they stood, months later and only hours away from making a move that would solidify their own little dynasty.
    </p>
<p>
     "Te amo, mijo. Now go! If you wait any longer you might come back to a battered boyfriend."
    </p>
<p>
     This got a laugh out of him, as well as the girls who had been quiet up until that point just observing the moment of respect and care between Rio and Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, okay! I will see you guys soon," he offered, lifting to give a gentle wave as he departed.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment the door shut, Rio's eyes shimmered with unfallen tears. This was all actually happening. They were stood there, waiting for the inevitable. The love of her life was apparently fighting for her life to keep the distance in place.
    </p>
<p>
     Their lives had started over that day, the moment they had opened their eyes into the light of the day.
    </p>
<p>
     It had only been a little while longer until the photographer and videographer had shown up, their little team setting about making a plan in the corner of Rio's room before a couple of them dispersed, surely to relocate with their things to the room Agatha was getting ready in. Shortly after, the stylist had arrived and everything seemed to take off.
    </p>
<p>
     It was hours of makeup and hair and Estee dumping a handful of cashews into Rio's palm so that she could keep enough on her stomach to quell any nerves that might have tried to surface.
    </p>
<p>
     This didn't make Rio nervous. None of it made Rio nervous, but Estee had pointed out that if she didn't maintain some semblance of normalcy, it might create room for those nerves to break through.
    </p>
<p>
     Things were coming together, robes were put on and photos were taken. Rio and their girls, and surely Agatha and their boys. It could be a little wild when there were so many people moving about Rio's given space, but she was doing everything she could to keep a level head and remind herself that the time was passing and they were getting closer to the day's final destination.
    </p>
<p>
     The stylist that had been tending to Rio gave one last gentle flick of a brush over her cheeks and stepped back to survey her work. Rio's eyes lifted to the woman to see that she looked completely thrilled with what she had managed to accomplish.
    </p>
<p>
     "When you're ready, there's a mirror behind you," she told Rio, pointing a finger in indication over Rio's shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     While she still intended to look, Rio's gaze lifted to the two girls on the couch who looked up at roughly the same time. In almost perfect sync, their expressions both softened and immediately, Rio was convinced they were going to cry.
    </p>
<p>
     "If you shed tears, now's the time to do it before you get your makeup on," Rio informed them.
    </p>
<p>
     It was Estee that moved, pushing herself up to her feet so that she could cross the room to her mother. She was careful in her placement, but she pulled Rio into her arms and gave her a firm hug, sniffling softly over her shoulder. When she pulled away, the look on her face was practically bleeding with honesty before she found her ability to speak.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Mama, you know I will always think that you are the most beautiful woman to exist, but... Right now, I think you're finally gonna understand why."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The smallest curling of her lips happened and she gave a gentle nod toward Rio, indicating that she really should take a look for herself.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio spun in place in her chair, the moment that her eyes found that mirror, she almost cried, too. She wondered in that moment if the stylist had meant it when she asserted that the makeup she was using was as waterproof as it could get. Surely, they were going to find out by the end of the day.
    </p>
<p>
     The choice of eye shadow, the application of just enough blush in just the right way, the color her lips now were, they were all just so... perfect. Her hair was pinned slightly on one side, but otherwise the curls that hung in ringlets over her shoulders fell
     <i>
      just right.
     </i>
     Rio had never been lacking in confidence when it came to what she looked like, but she truly heard Estee's words, and she understood them.
    </p>
<p>
     As Estee stepped up on one side of her, hand sliding onto Rio's shoulder, Tay copied the movement on the opposite side.
    </p>
<p>
     While the thought crossed Rio's mind that she wished she could have a photo of their reflection in the mirror, she did not realize that one was being taken from behind her, even if the reflection wasn't going to be visible in the shot. In consolation, it was the back view of a mother and her daughters in what was nothing more than a show of love and admiration on the happiest day of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     A few minutes later, Rio finished fastening the button on her suit jacket and glanced down at herself, the widest smile filling her face with ease. The suit fit perfectly in every right way, cinched exactly where it needed to be. It wasn't form-fitting or too tight in the way it hung from her frame. Despite the velvety material, it didn't feel thick or heavy. It was instead light in a way that Rio had not been expecting, a way that made her feel like she could float away before she stepped foot from behind that little screen.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment she did, there were two gasps that sounded at the exact same time. The way Estee and Tay were sat, hands clasped to their mouths and their eyes growing glassy again, Rio could have been knocked over with a feather. They looked truly taken by what they were seeing and it caused Rio to feel a warmth from her scalp to the tips of her toes. Her gaze shifted to the full mirror toward the corner and took a couple of steps into the frame of it.
    </p>
<p>
     What she saw just about took her own breath away. Agatha knew
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     what she was doing with every single choice she had made within the confines of that outfit. It was almost as if she had been able to see Rio in it before Rio could.
    </p>
<p>
     Her jaw tensed but only in an effort to not shed any tears. She wasn't going to cry before they got to the actual ceremony. She was not going to put her makeup at risk and chance looking like a fool before she could even get herself where she needed to be.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio turned to face the girls as they got to their feet, and there the three of them stood in their attire for the evening.
    </p>
<p>
     "One more thing," Estee reminded her, stepping forward to gingerly lift the vined crown from its box so that she could place it perfectly atop Rio's head. The action of doing so clearly made her emotional, but she seemed to choke it down for Rio's sake.
    </p>
<p>
     A moment later, an alarm sounded on Estee's phone. She quickly silenced it and cast her gaze back up toward her mother, a proud light dancing in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's time, mama."
    </p>
<p>
     With that, the night before them became etched in stone.
    </p>
<p>
     As the sun started the very beginning stages of its descent in the afternoon sky, Rio, Estee, and Tay emerged from the backside of the chateau they had spent their day in, arms linked with each woman on either side of Rio. What greeted them was a sea of roughly fifty heads that turned, filled mostly with faces Rio recognized, but there were a couple here and there that she did not know. Surely, there would be time to remedy that throughout the night.
    </p>
<p>
     The walk toward that platform with the structure wrapped in flowers and vines and where Jack stood waiting, it felt almost infinite. It felt like Rio might never get there, but her Oxfords finally scuffed against the wood beneath the flowing legs of her pants. Her head lifted to Jack, mouthing a silent 'thank you' to him for having agreed to officiate.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could hear it like a drum between her ears, the way her heart was absolutely pounding. She knew this was it, this was the dream being realized. It was months of planning, it was the way those blooms on the mountainside were bright and vibrant in the way Agatha had promised they would be. It was the rows of nicely dressed attendants who all bore wide smiles, thrilled to simply be a part of something so special.
    </p>
<p>
     She took her spot and turned to take in the view of the expanse she had just crossed, finally letting herself understand the weight of what was about to happen. Her smile was instant as she saw Nicky and Hēmi walk into view, completely dashing in their suits with those perfectly offsetting ties. They looked so damn handsome that it made Rio swell with just as much pride as she had for the two women who were now standing behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     Hēmi stepped forward, the small pillow bearing the rings in his hands as he made his way toward Rio and then stepped off to the opposing side, his grin never once dimming.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment the first notes of the song "I Choose You" by Sara Bareilles began to play, Rio almost felt like she wasn't even in her own body. She knew what was coming and yet, as the clopping of horse hooves sounded over the music, she felt like she very well might choke on her own anticipation.
    </p>
<p>
     She caught a glimpse, just briefly, as the carriage made its way down the hill, though it was mostly shrouded by greenery. And then, it pulled into view and Rio was instantly in an active battle to keep a lid on her desire to just melt into the ground at what she saw.
    </p>
<p>
     The driver of the carriage got out and opened the door just as Nicky approached, lifting a hand for his mother to take so he could help her out.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Agatha's heels hit the pavement and Rio finally saw with her own eyes the vision she had tried to create in her mind? She forgot what it was to breathe.
    </p>
<p>
     There stood Agatha, her arm in their son's, in that lavender dress that was embroidered in a way that almost made the bodice of it look like lace, though as it wound down into the skirt, it flowered out a bit more. The neckline had been
     <i>
      exactly
     </i>
     the right choice, even more so with the way that
     <i>
      breathtaking
     </i>
     jewel sat in the middle of her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, Rio Vidal was looking at the rest of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     She had never been more certain of anything else in her entire existence.
    </p>
<p>
     There was music. There was soft awe and reverence from those around them. There was the clicking of camera shutters happening. All of that noise and yet, the only thing Rio was convinced she could hear was the beating of Agatha's heart in time with her own.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment their eyes met, it was a distanced reflection of painfully wide grins and expressions that were fighting to keep the heavier emotions at bay for the time being. For as taken as Rio was right then by the sight of Agatha, she could clearly see that the same emotion was taking over Agatha, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Each step she took in stride with Nicky, Agatha's smile somehow grew, even a hair at a time. By the time Nicky helped her up those couple of steps onto the platform, Rio was worried that between the two of them, Agatha's face was going to crack first.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky stepped off to place himself next to Hēmi at the same time that Agatha slid her hands into Rio's, the shine of a thousand stars happening in those unending blue eyes. Rio could feel every emotion as it sat in her throat to be standing there like that, looking into the eyes of the woman she loved most in the world. She could feel how it wanted to choke her, but she wouldn't let it.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could lend too much thought to it, Jack was speaking, his voice carrying due to the microphone on his lapel.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good evening everyone! Thank you for joining us today. Please be seated and silence your phones if you haven't already."
    </p>
<p>
     Although it felt impossible, Rio tore her gaze from Agatha to look over at him for just a moment, already thankful for the presence he was able to pull. After a second, though, she was back to staring at the rest of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am convinced that the foundations to a solid marriage are often formed way before marriage is ever even a thought." His voice was so strong, carried so well even outside of the assistance that microphone offered.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nothing solidified that belief more than the first text message I received from Agatha the moment she returned from her trip to New Zealand for the first time. I will respect the bit of decorum she probably wishes to keep and not read those messages word for word," he offered and while everyone laughed, Rio's laughter hardly made its way around the emotion that was still sitting in her throat as she fought for her life to hold onto her composure for the next fifteen minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     "In those messages, she told me the most wild story. She said that she fell off of a bridge into a marina, and that the most beautiful Kiwi woman who lived on a houseboat pulled her out of the water." His gaze dropped from the crowd to take each of them in, in equal measure.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's cheeks were hot; hearing someone talk about her like that and knowing that he was only quoting the woman before her nearly made her swoon, but she continued to keep it together.
    </p>
<p>
     "She detailed to me how they sat on the deck of that houseboat and drank wine while the woman cooked her dinner and dried her clothes. She talked about the depth they'd managed in their conversations together. She spoke about her decision to throw a glass of water on dry clothes so she could stay there longer." At this, not only did Jack chuckle, but everyone else did, too. That was inclusive of the two brides as they both actively relived the memory.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha talked about how she'd fallen asleep with her head on the woman's lap and woke up to her clothes folded and waiting for her. She talked about coming out to see the woman making them breakfast and how much it had killed her to insist that she had to leave." He paused again, his eyes falling to Agatha who caught it and gave a gentle nod of encouragement. "When I asked her what the woman's name was, she told me she did not know. And in that moment, my heart broke for her. Because... When you see someone talk about another person like
     <i>
      that?
     </i>
     It's pretty clear how they feel about them, even after only a night."
    </p>
<p>
     In Rio's view, Agatha's lips twisted and it became clear to Rio that she was not the only one managing not to choke on the emotion of the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     "She spent the next weeks fighting through the awards season, but every single time we met up or she shot me a message, the conversation always turned back to Auckland. Most of the time, she would catch herself and apologize before turning the conversation in another direction, but it was something she had clearly been stuck thinking about."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio gave Agatha's hands a firm squeeze. This was a little tidbit of information that Rio had not been privy to before and it was only piling onto the amount of love she was feeling in that moment.
    </p>
<p>
     "About a week and a half after her most recent win, I received a text message from her. I will read that one in it's entirety. It said: 'JACKSON FREDERICK! YOU ARE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS. BOAT WOMAN SHOWED UP AT MY OFFICE THIS AFTERNOON!' And yes, it was all capitalized."
    </p>
<p>
     Again, another bout of laughter filled the space around them and Rio was damn near white knuckle gripping Agatha's hands in her own.
    </p>
<p>
     "It had been my hope, at that time, to meet 'Boat Woman,' who I then learned was actually named Rio, before she returned home. That hope was dashed when I received a call at three in the morning from Agatha asking for a favor so that she could get Rio back to New Zealand to be with her injured daughter."
    </p>
<p>
     Jack cleared his throat a little as he glanced toward Estee to give a small smile. He lifted his head again to look out at those gathered before them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Over the next months, I was on the receiving end of updates and photos that were very clear showings of just how much love exists between these two women. I got to watch through Agatha's lens as they quickly began to construct a life together in a way that seemed nothing short of magical. I was blessed to be privy to such a story, and I retain that sentiment to this day."
    </p>
<p>
     At the same time, both women turned their head to take Jack in for the briefest moment, their appreciation so glaringly obvious as it was written on their faces.
    </p>
<p>
     He offered them a smile and continued.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha sent me a photo of the engagement ring the moment she bought it after only a month. She included with it a brief but appropriate message, one that simply stated: 'Don't ask me if I'm sure, because I 100% am.' In that moment, I understood it without her having to explain it to me. There are moments in life, people that cross our paths, where we as humans just... know that they're supposed to be there. Agatha has
     <i>
      always
     </i>
     known that Rio was meant to be in her life. No amount of time would have ever changed that fact, or compelled her to make a different choice."
    </p>
<p>
     He offered a soft chuckle, looking up from the notes on his phone.
    </p>
<p>
     "As anyone here knows, Agatha is the most hardheaded person around. What I got the chance to learn not that long ago was that she had fittingly fallen in love with the most softhearted person I've ever had the pleasure of meeting. Rio is many things. She is a mother, she is an engineer. She's a reader and she knows how to surf very well, apparently. Rio has also become Agatha's best friend, her compatriot in the battle of life."
    </p>
<p>
     Jack took a brief pause, his adoring gaze falling to the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have no doubt that these two women are going to spend the rest of their lives in a marriage that brings with it not only happiness and joy, but also discovery and knowledge."
    </p>
<p>
     He took a step toward them.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, if you are both ready, I'd like to ask a couple of questions that will attest to your commitment to one another."
    </p>
<p>
     As their gazes broke to take him in, they each gave a gentle nod.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you both choose each other to be partners for life?"
    </p>
<p>
     In unison:
    </p>
<p>
     "We do."
    </p>
<p>
     He continued.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you choose to trust and respect each other, and to support one another in both good times and bad times?"
    </p>
<p>
     "We do."
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you love what you know about each other in this moment, and trust what you do not yet know?"
    </p>
<p>
     One more.
    </p>
<p>
     "We do."
    </p>
<p>
     "Perfect," he crooned softly. "Now is the part where I let them tell each other exactly why they're making this choice right here, right now, with their personal vows. Rio, if you would."
    </p>
<p>
     There it was. It was right there. She was in it. She was so wholly in the moment that she needed to take more than one deep breath to steady her wildly hammering heart long enough that she could form words.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha, my love," she began, shocking herself with the strength she had somehow found in her tone. "Since the day you fell into my life, you have given me a vantage point of the world that I never would have had in any other life. You have blessed me with an ability to see the truly remarkable things in the world, and how they often lay in the quieter moments." Rio took a breath, pressing her lips together to steady herself for a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, I stand here today with every intent of saying 'I do,' but what I am really saying is 'I will.' I will wake up every morning with the intent to love you the same, if not better, by the time I fall asleep that night. I will shower you in my affection for as long as you'll let me until you get annoyed and make a little quip about how much my optimism can be grating. I will catch the spiders that scare you in the shower and put them outside. I will fight myself every day on remembering to put back the hose after watering the garden. I will find peace in both the moments of us together as a family but also in those moments when it is just you and I alone. I will love our children, all of them, with the same ferocity that I love you. I will promise to go to any lengths I can manage to see you happy, to ensure you know how loved you are by me."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio drew in one more slow and deliberate breath before she finished speaking, though the expression Agatha was wearing almost made her choke on it. She looked so fucking enamored. Rio persisted.
    </p>
<p>
     "I stand here now, looking you in the eyes, telling you with the most sincerity I am capable of holding in my body that I
     <i>
      will
     </i>
     love you every, single, day, for the rest of my life without a single question to be raised."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha released one of Rio's hands to quickly swipe at the lone tear that had dropped over her eyelid, stopping it before it got too far down her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     She took a breath and Rio simply gave her an understanding and encouraging nod.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio, my entire heart," Agatha managed, clearing her throat in a search for strength when what Rio had to say had clearly moved her so deeply and so irrevocably. "This is a place I never thought I would be again in my life. The idea that I could look into the eyes of another human and promise them, the way I am about to promise you, that I could love them unconditionally for as long as I am able to breathe was one that had seemed outlandish. In the context of it being anyone else, it still is." Agatha's hands squeezed tightly as she pressed her lips in a tight but emotional smile as she found it in itself to keep going.
    </p>
<p>
     "You, Rio, are the only person on this earth that I will ever love
     <i>
      forever.
     </i>
     You, Rio, are the woman I will wake up in the middle of the night to watch stars and contemplate existentialism with. You, Rio, are the woman I will follow no matter where you go. You, Rio, are the woman I will think about no matter the day or time, or even if you're right next to me. You, Rio, are an incredible mother to our children. You, Rio Daniela, are all I will ever want or need in another human being, the only one who will know the love I have in this way. You are the one I will spend every single day proving that to."
    </p>
<p>
     There was only the quickest moment of complete awe and reverence that fell over every person in attendance, but Jack was quick to progress the ceremony.
    </p>
<p>
     "Now, Hēmi, the rings, if you would."
    </p>
<p>
     Hēmi stepped forward, presenting the rings. Rio reached over first, gently pulling that masterpiece of a wedding ring into her slightly trembling fingers. She pulled Agatha's hand into her own and very carefully but full of intent, she slid the ring onto Agatha's finger.
    </p>
<p>
     "These rings are a symbol of your lifelong commitment to one another. They are a seal to the vows that you have both made here before us. They are a physical presence of your unending promise to love one another for as long as you so shall live."
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio's eyes dropped to Agatha repeating the motions Rio herself had just done, and she saw the ring Agatha had selected? Her right hand flew to her mouth, fingertips gracing her lips as she sucked in a shocked breath.
    </p>
<p>
     The ring Agatha slid onto her finger was... It was
     <i>
      so Rio.
     </i>
     The main focus was not actually a diamond, it was a clear agate with green vines inside, winding through it. The band itself was a double set and the top band split into silver vines that cradled the top and the bottom of the agate. Beneath it, linked through the the bottom band, were five diamonds, the middle being the biggest as the pointed end of its teardrop shape faced Rio's knuckle. It was beautiful, and the fact that Agatha had picked such a piece had clearly landed with her in the way Agatha had been intending.
    </p>
<p>
     "By the power vested in me, and through the sheer power of your own love, I now pronounce you married!
    </p>
<p>
     Please, do us all the favor and finally kiss each other."
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the grin that had formed at hearing those words, and the soft laugh that produced itself beneath the sound of her heartbeat in her ears, Rio did not hesitate to do as she had been instructed.
    </p>
<p>
     Both of her hands raised, cupping Agatha's jaw in a way that was both familiar and so brand new and met her halfway in the first kiss of the rest of their lives.
    </p>
<p>
     Her wife, Agatha Harkness.

<p>
     There could have been a roar of applause, could have been a chorus of cheers the moment Rio was afforded the opportunity to kiss her wife, but it fell upon Rio's deaf ears. She couldn't hear a thing over the sound of her own heart as it pounded as loud as thunder in the center of her brain. All she cared about in that moment, everything else completely drowned out, was that she was kissing her wife.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Her wife!
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     This was a moment that, at a very early point in their relationship, Rio had realized was inevitable. Every theory, every question, every hypothesis that Rio and Agatha had shared with one another had led them to that moment, their friends and family roaring in approval as they solidified their love for one another in a promise of forever. Rio had invested herself wholly in every word she had said while looking Agatha in the eye, and she knew the same could be said for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     What they had done was momentous. What they had done was
     <i>
      beautiful.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     As they turned and held hands, facing the crowd that had gathered for them, Rio couldn't find it in her to dim her grin in the slightest. How could she? She was
     <i>
      married.
     </i>
     She had officially committed her life to someone else. No, not just someone.
    </p>
<p>
     She bound herself to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha would never be just someone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was everything.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing those smiles as they walked back up that aisle to the awaiting photographers and photo opportunities, it was the lightest feeling, and still somehow there was weight to it. It was the happiest Rio had ever been, but there was an understanding also found in those vows. They'd had it pretty easy in terms of how well they had integrated into one another's lives, but Rio was not foolish enough to ever consider that marriage would not take work. Forever was a long time, but Rio was of the mindset that any hiccup, any spat, any argument would be worth figuring out if it meant that she got to keep Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     They had spent the following hour -- while all their guests enjoyed beverages and hors d'oeuvres -- migrating from one location to another while the photographers bustled about, catching them in various poses; a side view from afar of Rio's lips pressed to Agatha's temple as Agatha grinned beneath the trellis lined with white roses in the greenhouse, one of them holding each other on that little bridge over the pond, grinning like complete idiots at each other.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been one that the photographer had immediately paced over to show them with a grin that Rio had immediately fallen in love with. There were on a ridge that dropped off into the valley and there was a jagged line of mountain base in the background as the sun set behind it. It was the purest illumination of the two women in love as Rio's hands were stationed on Agatha's sides and Agatha's hands had found Rio's biceps. That slight inch Rio had Agatha had dissipated with the height afforded by Agatha's heels and they were looking straight ahead, right into the eyes of the other. The wonder was clear on Rio's face and the absolute adoration was written all over Agatha's in ways that were glaringly obvious even from a profile view.
    </p>
<p>
     There were plenty of others, but by the time they were wrapping up, she could hear a faint call for order up the hill in the reception area. Everyone was finding their places and their children were likely putting on a show as they danced their way into the space.
    </p>
<p>
     For the briefest moment, Rio had that startling realization that she'd been struck with several times throughout her relationship with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      This was their life.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio did not think, in the least, that it would be the last time she had that thought in her lifetime, but in that moment, it felt like the most profound instance of it to date. The two of them had made their way up the stairs that led to the top of the hill. There was a stone path that wound forward in the direction of the reception area. As they got close to the mouth of it, Rio could hear Jack's voice booming as he introduced them.
    </p>
<p>
     The first notes of an acoustic guitar began to play to the tune of 'Complete' by Austin Gibbs as Rio glanced over at Agatha, that familiarly bright grin stuck on her face. Rio gave a light squeeze to Agatha's fingers before they turned to face forward, taking their first step toward greeting everyone they loved and cared for as a unit. They had been two separate pieces, but right then, they finally formed the bigger picture.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing everyone on their feet, clapping and cheering was the most surreal feeling. It was a celebration for them, a showing of love and support for this incredible life change they'd chosen for themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     The truest joy, though, was on the faces of their kids. They all looked close to tears, their vibrant grins never once faltering.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha and Rio had made the joint decision to save the first dance until after dinner; their guests had been out for hours in the hot California sun and it was probably best to feed them as soon as possible. So, as the newlyweds made their way behind the table and took their seats between their children, their eyes cast out on their support system, watching the chaos as meals were served and drinks were fetched.
    </p>
<p>
     While prayers were not exactly their style, they had asked Jack to offer a blessing, which as usual, he handled with absolute finesse.
    </p>
<p>
     Jack was good with his words. Jack loved Agatha. Jack had grown to love Rio, too. Every time he opened his mouth to speak that day, all of those facts had been painfully obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been little haste as the area filled with overlapping chatter and the clanking and clanging of silverware on glass as everyone began to eat. This, they had all known, was going to be the most opportune time to hold attention, and there was a lot to be said, at least by the two children that sat to the side of their mothers.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee had gotten to her feet first, tapping her champagne flute softly with the end of her knife.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi, everyone," Estee greeted as the attention turned to her. Rio glanced up to take in her daughter's profile and the way her throat quivered just slightly from nerves. Estee was no stranger to public speaking, but this was a little different. This was her reaching back as far as she could to try to explain to those before them what this meant to her, to be standing there making that toast. "My name is Estee and obviously, Rio is my mama. You are going to have to bear with me, as this might be a bit long." She was palming her glass as her eyes fell to her mother, her grin growing. They lifted again, sweeping over everyone in attendance.
    </p>
<p>
     "She has been my one and only parent for my entire life and no matter how many hours she spent giving herself a hard time over the fact, I had never wished for it to be any other way. In fact, I got into scraps with kids who told me that I
     <i>
      had
     </i>
     to have a dad because that was how the world worked." Estee paused, giving a little chuckle. "Once, I got into a fight with a bigger boy in primary school. I really gave it to him, but he busted my lip. Mama was this insane mixture of pissed off, proud, and worried when I came home that day. She asked me why I got into the fight and I wouldn't tell her."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat, leaning into Agatha who had her arm draped over Rio's shoulders. The expressions on their faces were almost carbon copies, transfixed and rapt by the way Estee was commanding the space.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes had started to water but she was once more actively reminding herself not to cry.
    </p>
<p>
     "It took me a couple of weeks, but I finally did. I told her what the kids said and she just... hugged me. She told me that she appreciated my desire to defend her honor, but she also looked me in the eyes and told me that when you have the people you love in your life already, you don't need anyone else." Estee took a breath, her lips twisting as she glanced over at her mama and her mum. She offered them a wide and bright smile before continuing.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think for a very long time, she believed that. In fact, for most of my life, she believed it. It was just us, and that was more than good enough. And then, one morning I got a phone call, one that completely changed my life way before I would ever be aware of it. During that call, she told me about how she'd had a dinner guest and did not immediately follow it up with any indication that it was a neighbor or colleague. This, I knew, was different." The glass shifted from one hand to another as Estee continued. "Listening to her talk about about this woman who had fallen off the bridge... It was insane because I heard tones of voice I had never heard from my mother. I heard her use words that told me how much she'd thought about it. I could
     <i>
      hear
     </i>
     the grin she was wearing the longer she went on."
    </p>
<p>
     The air around them was still and silent, but Estee understood it for what it was; this was the only first-hand view anyone would ever get of what it was like to watch as Rio, actually, was the one who had fallen the furthest despite Agatha's plunge.
    </p>
<p>
     "When she told me that she didn't know the woman's name, I was... pretty crushed. I'd literally never, in twenty-one years of life, heard her talk about anyone or anything the way she talked about that woman and that night. And... when she picked me up from the airport for break, it was clear that something had really taken root in her, something that was pulling her down. So, I kept her busy, made sure she had something good to think about. The Monday after I got in, the Oscars were on." Estee paused to breathe a laugh. "We watch it every year even though she doesn't care, or have any idea what's actually going on. She does it because she knows I like it, even if it has never had much significance to her outside of an opportunity to bond and make me happy."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Estee drew in a long and slow breath, moving to cradle her glass in both hands.
    </p>
<p>
     "As was normal, she was distracted by something on her phone during the category I had been excited to see. And then, they announced the winner. And then... Then, mama looked up and I have
     <i>
      never
     </i>
     seen the color drain out of her entire being the way I did in that moment. It didn't make any sense. It made even less sense when she called me by my actual name and said 'That's
     <i>
      her.
     </i>
     ' I tried to reiterate that it was the director I had referenced earlier in the night, but she shook her head. She looked me in the eye as she told me that the woman on the television was the same woman that had fallen into the marina. I literally didn't believe her at first."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, there was a collectively gentle laughter that bubbled over the crowd and Estee smiled, knowing that from that point forward, she was not going to be able to wrangle her true feelings and the severity of them much longer.
    </p>
<p>
     "After that, the rooting was pulling her deeper. Something about the entire thing had started to sink her and it... It was hard to watch. So, when she took me back to the airport to return to uni, I had something to say. I knew it was something she wasn't going to like, but I needed to say it nonetheless. I told her that I thought she should go to America and... Then I admitted I had already found the address to Agatha's office. She... wasn't thrilled with me, or the idea." She braved a glance at the two older women for just a moment before she looked away and cleared her throat, her own emotion starting to well.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't think that she meant to let slip about the earring. The earring she had found on the docking post at the end of the walk. She said it was Agatha's earring, but then tried to explain it away by insisting she lost it. So... I asked her a very simple question. I asked her if the back was on it. And... it was."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's lips curled into a warm smile as she glanced down into her champagne, a soft chuckle passing through her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "So I let her sit with that as I boarded a plane to head home. She called me at two in the morning that night and told me she was going. Even though I was exhausted, I was so happy for her. She was terrified, but she was doing it anyway, and that made me
     <i>
      so
     </i>
     damn proud. What followed was... Gods, it was amazing. She was so...
     <i>
      happy.
     </i>
     Even when things back at home had their hiccups and she was ready to immediately take off from that happiness, I was able to convince her to stay, and I am so glad I did. Every FaceTime, every phone call... I was bearing witness to my mother falling for someone for the first time in my life. I would have told her to stay forever, if the universe had allowed it. But... As we all are aware, that is not how the world works."
    </p>
<p>
     It was at this point that Estee knew she had to keep her focus ahead of her. If she didn't, she was not going to make it through the rest of her speech.
    </p>
<p>
     "One night after spending time at the beach looking for crabs, Tay and I were headed home. I... Admittedly, I don't remember much of it. I was told we were in a pretty serious accident, and it left me to spend the next months learning how to walk again. But... before any of that, I woke up first." There was the slightest tremble in Estee's strong tone, breaking slightly. "I opened my eyes to a white ceiling and I felt two hands wrapped around my own. My first and only thought was that my mama was there, that somehow, she was there. It didn't make sense in my disoriented brain, but... it was my first thought. When I turned my head, though, it wasn't mama that was sitting there with wide eyes that brimmed with tears of relief. No, it was Agatha instead."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee cleared her throat, trying to find her resolve again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha and I met for the first time in that hospital room when I was at my most vulnerable and Agatha was brandishing her cape, proving that she was an actual superhero. She played with my fingers as we talked about mama, about what had landed them there. That look on her face any time mama's name came out of her mouth? I didn't need either of them to put a name to it for me to see what it was, even right then and there."
    </p>
<p>
     Behind her, Estee could hear the sniffles as they first started and then grew in frequency.
    </p>
<p>
     "In the weeks that followed, with accompaniment from some annoying kid with wild hair and a bad attitude..." Estee voiced, grinning as she tossed a comically pointed glare at her brother, "We spent more and more time together. In that time... this strange thing started to happen. It was almost as if life had started to build around us, instead of us building a life. Things just fell into place in a way I thought only existed in fairytales. That couldn't have been more true our first day back in Auckland after Tay and I were done with uni. Before we even got back home, Agatha stole Tay and I away so she could purchase an engagement ring with our help. Being asked to assist with such a task... It told me that Agatha didn't just love my mom, she loved me too, and it meant something to her that I be a part of that decision."
    </p>
<p>
     Out of the corner of her eye, Estee could see the movement of both of her parents dabbing at their faces to try and keep from ruining their makeup. It caused her to huff a gentle chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     "When life happened and Agatha had to come back here alone... It really hit me. I didn't have to fight public opinion anymore, even if it had never really been all that important in the first place. The fact still stood... It no longer felt like I only had one parent. Mama has
     <i>
      always
     </i>
     had my back, but without Agatha around... Without her haughty sarcasm, her profound musings and her constant ability to keep a smile on mama's face... It felt like a piece of who I have grown into was temporarily displaced."
    </p>
<p>
     What Estee had not realized was that in the crowd before her, there was hardly a dry eye there. She was a little too deep in it at that point to notice.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... Maybe mama had been convinced once upon a time that she would never need this, that she would be okay to keep our little village to her, myself and Tay... But if I look at her right now, not only will it cause me to bawl like a tiny tyke, I will also see that having this village of six instead means the absolute world to her."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee took one final breath and held up her glass.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, all of this to say... Here's to finding the things you never even knew you were looking for in ways you never knew you needed. Cheers, everyone."
    </p>
<p>
     As Estee turned, Rio was already on her feet in an impulsive show of affection that solidified itself in the way she wrapped her arms around her daughter tightly. The clinking of glasses and soft cheers sounded like nothing but murmurs of congratulations as Rio squeezed her daughter as tight as she could manage.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Te amo, mija,"
     </i>
     Rio breathed at her, kissing the side of her head. As she released her and they both started to separate, they were unaware that Nicky had gotten to his feet, holding his own glass up slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "So I'd like to first start by saying that Estee is absolutely being modest in that entire retelling and will never take the credit over being the entire reason we're all sitting here," he began, glancing over at Estee with his classic Nicky grin. "But... she is. She doesn't know we all talk about it as much as we have... But if she never would have asked about the backing on the earring... If her genius brain had never caught onto that one small detail... Well, I think you can all imagine," he tacked on, grinning wide even as he glanced to his mother for just a moment, a soft look of reverence crossing his features.
    </p>
<p>
     "As the majority of you know, my mom and I... Well, we've had several personal growth moments over the years. We've had our ups and we've had our downs. And... the night I first met Rio was most certainly not an up." Nicky's chin tucked slightly and while Rio could see that it was important to him to frame things this way, she couldn't help but think back to that night and how angry he had been. He was right there with her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I had come home to surprise mom. And... there was a new face to add to the long list of ones I'd spent plenty of time trying to forget. I was... not exactly nice when she tried to explain herself to me. I called her names I shouldn't have, made a lot of snap judgements that even now, I wish I could take back."
    </p>
<p>
     He paused and gave a gentle clearing of his throat as he glanced over at Rio, offering her a tight smile before his eyes lifted again.
    </p>
<p>
     "I remember looking mom in the eye and damn near promising her that I would never look at anyone, Rio included, as any kind of a parental figure. In that moment, my anger had been speaking. In that moment, I never could have realized just how wrong I was. I never could have imagined what it would feel like to stand in the pool house by the window and listen as Rio talked about my mom to Estee and Tay for the first time. I never could have imagined what it would feel like to get that text from mom that she'd left the country because Estee had been hurt. I spent hours debating on what the right thing to do was, having just gotten back in Dubai. Before I even realized what I'd done, I was printing a boarding pass for Auckland."
    </p>
<p>
     His eyes dropped to his drink in an attempt to figure out what words were going to work best right then.
    </p>
<p>
     "And then... A life I hadn't known I wanted to be living started to open up before me. I made two amazing friends who I now look at as sisters. More importantly, though, I finally let myself accept the idea that maybe I
     <i>
      could
     </i>
     see Rio as someone who cared not only for my mom, but for me, too. It was in the small things, like the recipe trading and the tips and tricks when it came to cooking. Mom had taught me to cook pretty young in life, but Rio taught me how to fold passion into every bite. The two women I love most in the world always do that, they find ways to impart their perspective wisdom in regard to the same topic and yet, it's two completely different pieces to a whole picture, no matter what that topic actually is."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky tried to clear his throat again, but it was clear to the women looking up at him that he was struggling a little more with the weight of his words more than he thought he might have.
    </p>
<p>
     "For me, what it all boils down to is that the moment I stopped being angry about the things in my past, it was the same exact moment I understood what it was to be loved, by many people, unconditionally. I understood that this amazing woman my mother fell in love with was forever going to be a fixture in our lives, as long as I chose to stick around."
    </p>
<p>
     He shifted a bit, his eyes falling on his mother and his mama, a sweet smile curling his lips as the rest of his expression softened. He was focused on Rio as he spoke again.
    </p>
<p>
     "So for as much as this toast is to your union and future together, it is also to you, mama.
     <i>
      Te amo más que a nada."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It didn't need a translation, not with the way Rio's face crumpled and she sniffed softly in an attempt to not immediately start sobbing. Before Rio could get to her feet, Nicky had already moved to place himself behind her, leaning over to wrap an arm around her, squeezing her tight.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I love you too, Nicholas,"
     </i>
     she breathed at him, just loud enough so he could hear.
     <i>
      "More than anything."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Although Agatha and Rio had faired pretty well, there was still this bold statement of pure and raw feeling that was sitting over that table, heading up the space they all occupied.
    </p>
<p>
     Their children were... Incredible? Brilliant? Compassionate? Articulate?
    </p>
<p>
     Their children were masterpieces in their own rights.
    </p>
<p>
     They all sat, laughing and talking and bantering across the table as they finished their meals. As everything had been cleared away, Jack had once more stepped up to announce that the time had come for the brides to share in their first dance.
    </p>
<p>
     With ease and a strange -- and almost foreign -- sense of confidence, Rio got to her feet and held her hand out to Agatha who grinned the moment she took it and stood as well. Together, they walked out into the open space of the dancefloor as the lights hung all around them illuminated it in a sparkling haze.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hands fell into place on Agatha's side at the same exact moment Agatha's hands landed on Rio's chest, fingertips finding her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     The faintest guitar plucks sounded over the speakers as the song 'Boats and Birds' by Gregory and the Hawk began to play. It was one that Estee had brought to them in an earnest showing of how deeply the lyrics had resonated with her.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      If you'll be my star, I'll be your sky. You can hide underneath me and come out at night. When I turn jet black and you show off your light, I live to let you shine. You can skyrocket away from me, and never come back if you find another galaxy far from here with more room to fly. Just leave me your stardust to remember you by.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The movements were easy only because they were automatic as the two of them began to dance, slowly swaying and shifting as they locked eyes across the space between them. What had started as grins had softened into something more tender, something more reserved for that moment right then.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      If you'll be my boat, I'll be your sea. A depth of pure blue just to probe curiosity. Ebbing and flowing and pushed by a breeze, I live to make you free. And you can set sail to the west if you want to, and pass the horizon 'til I can't even see you. Far from here, where the beaches are wide, just leave me your wake to remember you by.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     It could have been a moment for soft conversation, for stating the disbelief at the moment they were locked into right then, but they didn't need it. They had what they needed, all that they needed, in the way they were holding onto one another, sharing their very first dance as a married couple. They held everything in that gaze that was entirely unwavering until the song began to draw to a close. Agatha was the one to break it, glancing down at Rio's lips in a way that made Rio feel so impossibly warm.
    </p>
<p>
     As the last notes played, she was not at all surprised as Agatha's hands lifted from her chest and cupped her jaw so that she could give her a sweet and gentle kiss that drew cheers and applause. It made Rio's cheeks flush, but she was reminded once more that
     <i>
      this was their life now.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Jack's voice sounded as he indicated that the next dance belonged to the mothers and their children. Nicky and Estee both raised from their seats and made their way around opposing ends of the table to both Rio and Agatha awaiting them with outstretched arms. The embraces happened in time with one another and then, the music began to play.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a song both of the children had decided on and after Nicky had played it for them the first time, Rio had spent the next three days listening to it on repeat whenever she had a free moment. It was called 'Different' by Acceptance and each new time Rio had listened to it, she found something else that hit her square in the chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Her arms were nearly wrapped around her daughter as they began to move in time with the music.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Tell myself on the ride home, getting tired and hating all I've known. Holding on like it's all I have. Count me out when it's clear that I find it hard to say. I wanted to see something that's different, something you said would change in me. I wanted to be anything different, everything you knew would change in me.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was still surfing the wave of speechlessness, but she should have known that they were not getting out of this dance without Estee having something to say with a gentle whisper that could be heard only by Rio over the music.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "This is where we really begin, isn't it mama?"
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     A lone tear dropped despite Rio's heartwarming smile, but she didn't address it and instead reached up to cradle the back of Estee's head so she could pull it toward her to place a kiss to the soft skin of her forehead.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I think it is, mija."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The grin Estee wore as she lifted her head was bright, but there was also a sense of mischief, one that Rio did not understand until the end of the next verse.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      Got this way, up front but never true. God, I'm wrong and it's just the way I am. Crashing down, any chance you hear. Caving in, any chance that you could see inside of me and I don't know what to say. It's fine; This isn't Hollywood. So fine, getting in your way.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
<i>
      I wanted to see something that's different.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     At that moment, they were all four close enough that Nicky and Estee caught each other's gazes and grinned, giving a nod. In an instant, Estee let go of her hold on Rio and Nicky's grip on Agatha released, too. With the most fluid movement, they danced around one another and swapped spots. Nicky's arm was around Rio's waist in an instant, his hand holding hers up and poised. Estee landed in Agatha's arms with a beaming and bright smile lighting up her face.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Oh, you two,"
     </i>
     Rio chastised the young man in front of her, but he hadn't stopped smiling.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "We didn't feel right not sharing,"
     </i>
     he disclosed in a soft murmur and Rio repeated the same action she had managed with her daughter, though it took a little more effort to kiss Nicky's forehead with how tall he was.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      I'm taking a chance, this could be different. This could be all I'm waiting for. Something that's different. Something that's different.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     As the song drew to a close, there were still tears sitting in Rio's eyes, ones that fell as Agatha and Estee approached. Not a moment later, all four of them locked in an embrace that sparked sniffles and tears from several members of the crowd.
    </p>
<p>
     When they broke apart, it was time for the party to really begin.
    </p>
<p>
     Greeting everyone, trying to hold even small conversations, it was a lot, but Rio felt like it was also easy at the same time. She was comfortable there as she mingled and made any introductions that might have been missed previously. It was endless conversation from person to person and instead of depleting Rio's social battery like she had been worried it might, she was absolutely thriving.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been close enough to hear an exchange between a couple of the Landon siblings -- Thea and Wyatt -- and Nicky, who was fastened snugly against Hēmi's side.
    </p>
<p>
     "You... You look really happy, Nicky. It suits you," Thea had told him, her voice soft with her honesty. Nicky's reaction immediately displayed that such behavior was not commonplace for their relationship.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thea, how much have you had to drink? You're being nice to me?! Something's wrong..." he managed back, that wild and teasing grin bright across his face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, my mistake. I'll remember to never be sweet with you again, lest you worry and send for an ambulance."
    </p>
<p>
     The laughter that bubbled out of the group and for a moment, Rio glanced back to her partner in conversation, Adam, who was smiling nearly as wide as Rio was. The brightness on those smiles seemed to amp up even further at Wyatt's words.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, but really... I'm still single and living at home. What's the chance I can get some of what y'all have if I hop a plane to New Zealand?"
    </p>
<p>
     More laughter, more clinking of glasses, more drinking.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio and Agatha had migrated back toward one another after Agatha tied up whatever conversation she had been having with Jack and she had spotted Rio in conversation with Walker and Dave. She had joined them, diving right in with ease as the four of them simply talked and discussed plans for the future, what their travel schedule would look like and when they could come to the Landon Mansion and spend time with them. Rio had been transfixed on Dave, who was talking about wanting to visit where his father had grown up, to a point where she had not noticed anything else happening.
    </p>
<p>
     However, Agatha was locked in. She'd watched as a man -- entirely underdressed and very out of place -- stepped into the space by the bar. The fact that this floored her did not touch her posture.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, Agatha was processing.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      What the fuck was Colton Scratch doing standing in her goddamn wedding reception? Not in a coma, at that!
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Apparently, the source that had delivered the news had not thought this to be pertinent enough to inform her, or Dave, of this time around.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha was working through a plan in her head, her eyes lifted and caught sight of Nicky, whose gaze had lifted at the wrong time, catching sight of his father. Coolly and calmly, Nicky placed his hand to Hēmi's chest and placed a soft kiss to his cheek as he excused himself for just a moment.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky was immediately on the move. For a moment, Agatha let him go. She was still muttering soft
     <i>
      mmhmm's
     </i>
     and
     <i>
      yeah, sure's
     </i>
     to try and appear invested in the conversation, but she was nowhere near being present in that moment.
    </p>
<p>
     The closer Nicky got, she knew she needed to be there to intervene if it got bad. Agatha placed her hand on the small of Rio's back and kissed her on the cheek.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "I'll be right back. Found someone else I haven't spoken to tonight."
     </i>
     It was a simple enough explanation that drew no question from Rio. However, Agatha's gaze lifted to Dave before it flickered toward the direction of her son and ex-husband, and he only needed a second to understand. It was now his task to keep Rio busy for the next five minutes or so. He gave an almost imperceptible nod and Agatha departed.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky came to a stop directly in front of his father and even though Agatha could not see his face, she knew how angry he was before he had even started to speak.
    </p>
<p>
     "How dare you," Nicky growled, poking a firm finger right in the middle of Colton's chest. "You literally fuck off for a decade and then you think your balls are big enough to show up here? Tonight of all nights? You could have fucking picked up a phone, but you're trying to ruin a moment for her because... What?! You're jealous?! You're angry?! Guess what, Colton! It doesn't matter!"
    </p>
<p>
     His voice was firm, but he was not being loud. In fact, Agatha was almost certain that anyone who was any further away than she was likely wouldn't have even heard.
    </p>
<p>
     "You were a shit dad when you were around and now you're just a shit person for coming here to try and fuck up the
     <i>
      one good thing
     </i>
     my mom has in her life. I really,
     <i>
      really
     </i>
     do not want to cause any type of scene here, out of respect for my parents, but I swear to gods if you don't leave..."
    </p>
<p>
     Before her son could make a threat that might get him into any kind of trouble, Agatha stepped up behind him and slid her hand onto his shoulder from behind. She leaned up enough to press a soft kiss to the side of his head.
    </p>
<p>
     "Go back to Hēmi and your sisters, baby boy. I can handle this."
    </p>
<p>
     As he looked down at her, she could see just how upset he was. His cheeks were red and his eyes were a little wild, that bright green flashing with licks of flames. He huffed a disgruntled sigh out of his nose and let his shoulders slump before he complied.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment he was on his way, her attention sliced right back to the man before her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You didn't even tell him?"
    </p>
<p>
     "What?" Agatha snipped back, her eyes narrowing. "That a man who hasn't spoken to him in ten years was in a coma? Honestly, I thought you still were right up until the moment that I looked up to wonder what the fuck nerve you think you have to be standing anywhere near my very private wedding reception. Which, please do let me know who gave you the information. I've got plans for them."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha --"
    </p>
<p>
     "No, Colton. You don't get to show up here and say
     <i>
      anything.
     </i>
     I don't want to know the reasoning behind such a show of disrespect. How fucking
     <i>
      dare
     </i>
     you show up here, in front of my
     <i>
      wife.
     </i>
     How fucking
     <i>
      dare
     </i>
     you show your face around a child you haven't cared for in ten years. So I will say this only once, Colton Scratch. Your existence is not a necessity in the lives of anyone currently here, not our guests, not the children I share with her, and certainly not my wife or myself. This is not a time where you get to talk, where you get to say absolutely anything at all. This is the time where I look you, right in your eyes, and tell you that I never want to see you again for as long as I live, and I feel safe in the assumption that Nicky feels the same. If that changes for him, I'll help him find you to reach out, but that is a mighty large 'if.'"
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips pressed together hard, her hot gaze doing everything it could to burn holes into the man in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You made your decision to abandon him because of your feelings toward me. I'm sorry that you got stuck with me for ten years, truly, because it wasn't a walk in the park for me, either. I'm sorry that your feelings were hurt the moment you knew we only got married because of my public appearance. But... you knew. You knew before I got blackout drunk that night that I didn't want to sleep with you, or any man. And once I did, I knew I'd never do it again and I walked away from you in any facet that wasn't a public one. But Nicky... He was worth the shot at a normal childhood. With the two of us, he of course had no hope, but I'd still wanted it for him."
    </p>
<p>
     There was a brief pause in her tirade as she took in a deep breath and re-centered herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "He's never had to tell me for me to see how hard it was to spend time with you when I was away. He's never had to put into words that it wasn't just me who was neglecting him, but you were the one present. You looked at him and all you saw was everything you hated about me. He deserved more. He
     <i>
      deserves
     </i>
     more, and my wife gives that to him. She tells him she loves him every chance she gets. She lays her head on his shoulder when we're all watching movies together. She cooks with him. She drives him to places she knows he would love to take pictures of. She has
     <i>
      zero
     </i>
     biological relation to him, but he is
     <i>
      her son
     </i>
     just as much as he is mine."
    </p>
<p>
     One more breath, one final blow to be dealt.
    </p>
<p>
     "So I will give you the next fifteen seconds to make your exit without protest or I know an incredibly fit rugby player that would be more than happy to help you find it. And I'm sure if I ask him nicely, he'll make it hurt when he tosses you to the curb."
    </p>
<p>
     The venom was thick over each and every single one of Agatha's words and the way her eyes had narrowed left little room for any kind of miscommunication.
    </p>
<p>
     Without another word, he turned on his heel and walked away with his tail tucked between his legs, making Agatha feel far more powerful than she had thought the interaction might. He'd not gotten a word in edgewise and he had accepted her scathing degradation of his character for what it was. It also helped that he knew Agatha was not one to make empty threats.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha stood, staring at the spot where Colton had disappeared only moments before, she was startled back into presence as Rio slid up next to her, hooking an arm around her as she stepped beneath Agatha's arm.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you alright, my love?" Rio asked, none the wiser to anything that had just transpired.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, baby," Agatha assured her, leaning in to steal a soft kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you know Dave was planning on buying a house in Wine Country?" Rio posed, the softest giggle that indicated her raised level of intoxication slipping through her lips at the thought.
    </p>
<p>
     "He's been saying that for almost ten years," Agatha returned, an easy grin finding her face despite the gravity of what had just unfolded.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the night had worn on with countless cheers and dancing. It was a flurry of joy and happiness and unity that Rio had never before gotten to experience. It was a thing of beauty, something that she would be happy to hold onto forever.
    </p>
<p>
     Things had started to wind down after cake and last round of drinks, but the children were not quite finished with the emotionally touching gestures for the day. Hēmi and Tay had placed themselves to the side as Nicky and Estee pulled their mothers back to their seats at the head of that big table and sat them down.
    </p>
<p>
     "What's this about?" Agatha had questioned, but before anyone could offer a verbal answer, Estee reached over Rio's shoulder and laid down a large leather-bound book that was very clearly a photo album.
    </p>
<p>
     "This is our gift to you. And we wanted to give it to you now so that you could take it with you to Iceland if you needed it." She gave her mother's shoulder a soft squeeze, looking over top her head to beam down at Agatha who looked like she was suddenly on the verge of tears.
    </p>
<p>
     Together, both Rio and Agatha reached forward and opened the cover to reveal the first page.
    </p>
<p>
     In the very middle was a large, page-wide photo. It had been taken weeks before by Nicky at the scrimmage Hēmi had invited them to; it was after it was over and Nicky, who had been on a higher level, snapped a picture that had all six of them in frame. Hēmi was leaning over the barrier with an arm slung over Rio's shoulder who looked like she was going to combust from happiness. Agatha was right on the other side of her, laughter all over her expression. Estee's grin was only visible just barely as she peered out from behind her brother, and Tay rounded out the photo with her head just above Estee's.
    </p>
<p>
     Just below it, in gold print read the words:
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      The Harkness-Vidal Family and Their Memories.
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     The next fifteen minutes was spent reliving so many moments in the last months that had been captured by their kids beyond their knowledge. There were photos of Rio as she danced around the yard and watered the plants. There were photos of Agatha with her hair up and a pen in her mouth as she tried to put together a piece of furniture. There were ones of the two of them together sitting in various places as the light of a setting sun filled the space before them. There were pictures of Agatha chasing Estee around the yard with the hose, and ones of Rio and Nicky playing Go in the living room. There were over a hundred photos that had been slotted into place in that book and there were spaces for many more.
    </p>
<p>
     The tears had started falling somewhere in there, tears that wet the cheeks of both women as well as Estee, who pointed out that not crying didn't make Nicky tough.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stood and pulled her daughter into a hug for the millionth time, squeezing her tight though this time she did not feel the need to assert yet again just how much she loved her little girl. In tandem, Agatha was on her feet and squeezing her son firmly in her arms. As they all parted, they were informed that their ride was there and it was time for the final send-off.
    </p>
<p>
     Every person in attendance had lined up, two parallel throngs of people facing each other, and the moment Agatha and Rio appeared before them, they lit up the extra long sparklers they had been handed and extended arms, creating an arch of sparks that illuminated the dark mountain night. With a grin on each of their faces and their hands fastened tightly together, Rio and Agatha began their journey toward their life as a married couple, walking through every bit of love their friends and family had to offer on their way.
    </p>
<p>
     They placed kisses to the cheeks of their children before sharing in one last embrace with each of them. The goodbyes weren't hard this time. The kids knew where they were going, knew they were free to spend time wherever they chose over the course of time Rio and Agatha were going to be in Iceland. The kids knew that this instance of separation was much needed and they made it known in the way they delivered their 'I love yous' and 'See you laters.'
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled the back door to their limo open and stood back, offering the space to Agatha so she could slide inside. The moment Rio copied the action and shut the door behind her, she felt Agatha's presence immediately against her, a cause for an instant and tender smile.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hello, my wife,"
     </i>
     Rio cooed at her, placing a soft kiss between Agatha's eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Hi, my wife,"
     </i>
     Agatha murmured back, nuzzling her face into Rio's neck.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Today has been perfect."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha breathed the gentlest laugh into Rio's skin.
    </p>
<p>
<i>
      "Life with you has always been perfect, Rio, and I'm glad I know I get it every single day moving forward."
     </i>
</p>
<p>
     That, Rio thought, was a forever that she could hold onto with pride, with happiness, and with commitment.
    </p>
<p>
     That was a forever that Rio Vidal would never shy away from.

      *****
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agathaaa, we need to be up in three hours to make it to the airstrip,"
     </em>
     Rio exhaled in a sigh that was far more worked up than it should have been at three in the morning when they had to get up at six. Agatha's insatiability had kept them busy since the moment they had walked in that door but Rio knew both of them would be useless if they did not try to have some sort of nap, at the very least.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's mouth was too preoccupied with the ravenous kisses she was placing over the length of Rio's neck to answer at first. Traveling up, her lips finally graced Rio's ear with their presence.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "We can sleep on the plane,"
     </em>
     Agatha tried to bargain, but Rio's quip back came almost instantly.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "There's absolutely no way you are suggesting that on our first solo flight on a private jet where I am not a nervous wreck, you have zero intentions of garnering our membership to the mile high club."
     </em>
     Rio's whispers had the ring of slight exasperation to them, but only in the sense that she had a feeling that they were likely not going to be getting much sleep after what was already an incredible but equally as exhausting day.
    </p>
<p>
     The chuckle that Agatha breathed against her ear caused a shock of goosebumps to flare on every inch of her bare skin, even in the places it was pressed flush to Agatha's with the way her weight had settled half atop Rio's body.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's like you know me or something,"
     </em>
     Agatha cooed at her, still so close to her ear. In the next breath, she could feel the lightest dragging of fingertips that began above her navel and danced upward over her abdomen, but could go no further due to the roadblock of Agatha's own body. So what did she do instead? Those fingers skated back down, just to the lower side of that same navel before retracing over their initial track.
    </p>
<p>
     It was this back and forth motion that Agatha put on repeat, though each time she dropped it, it fell a little lower. Each  checkpoint between Rio's navel and her core between laps was met with Agatha's lips pressing to her ear, or a heavy sigh breathed into it.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time Agatha's touch made its way into the patch of hair between Rio's legs, she was trying to shift around, to silently insist that they needed to sleep. That, however, was made difficult with the way Agatha's weight atop her had her pinned.
    </p>
<p>
     Strangely, it didn't panic Rio like it might have many moons ago. Instead, it was doing exactly what Agatha was hoping it might and she was growing more and more aroused, especially with the way Agatha began to suck on the spot of Rio's neck just below her.
    </p>
<p>
     Hey! That was her favorite thing to do to Agatha! When the fuck had she co-opted that move?!
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Copycat,"
     </em>
     Rio whined lowly, though the way she shifted her head to expose more of her neck to her wife signified that she wasn't actually mad about it. As Agatha continued to kiss and suck at the available flesh before her, Rio could not contain the yawn that dropped her jaw and rattled around them.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Just one more,"
     </em>
     Agatha requested, and if Rio hadn't known any better, she could have sworn she heard the edge of a plea. That thought filled her middle with an unbearable heat.
    </p>
<p>
     Together, they had just experienced the biggest day of their lives, the day when everyone around them got to watch as they promised each other an eternity, despite what life might try to deliver them. Together, they had made their own personal agreement that despite the insanity their lives had been since the day they'd met and despite how crazy it would probably always be going forward, they would meet any challenge side by side. They always had. Together, they were going to keep their love alive.
    </p>
<p>
     In that moment, Agatha's way of fanning the flame was wanting to pay attention to her brand new wife in the most intimate and pleasurable ways. Rio could almost hear it, the way Agatha was desperate in that head of hers to squeeze as much into the day before it became a new one. She wanted to pack it as full of memories as she could.
    </p>
<p>
     Who would Rio have been to tell her no?
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "One more,"
     </em>
     came a whisper of agreement, though Rio's head lulled slightly on the pillow in a way that forced Agatha to move her head.
     <em>
      "But kiss me, first."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Eagerly, Agatha had met not only the demand, but the permission as well. Rio had let Agatha touch her like that, kiss her like that, until she came for what felt like the hundredth time that night and dissolved into exhaustion satisfaction as her wife settled against her chest and they were both able to doze for the following few hours.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was, as she knew she would be, a little on the grumpier side for about the first thirty minutes she was awake, especially in their rush to make sure they had everything they were going to need for the couple of weeks they were going to be away. Most of it had been pre-packed days before the wedding, but there were odds and ends that they scrambled around to secure before finally heading out the door.
    </p>
<p>
     The flight had been a long one, totaling over half of a day of travel time including the stop it took to refuel. As it turned out, there had been plenty of time to sleep, and even time left over to slip into that too-nice bathroom and indulge in the rush of what it was to be the in-love and horny couple they were.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had fucked her wife thousands of miles in the air.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had
     <em>
      fucked
     </em>
     her
     <em>
      wife
     </em>
     on a moving
     <em>
      plane.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Never in her life, before meeting Agatha, had she
     <em>
      ever
     </em>
     considered she would be able to make such a statement, and while it was undoubtedly hot, there was something else there. Even if it could be considered inappropriate, Agatha never seemed to stop providing Rio with new experiences. Were they a little... uncaged sometimes? Maybe, but there had been plenty of other instances throughout the course of their relationship where Agatha had provided the same rush that had not involved them stripping down without the ability to keep their hands to themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had taken Rio on her first horseback ride.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had given Rio the sights of LA at night from one of the tallest buildings in the city.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been there when Rio's entire world was falling apart and so she'd put them on that very plane to get her home.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had proved to Rio very quickly that she would show her the world and thensome if it meant that Rio would be happy, that she would feel any good emotion over being tended to with so much love and compassion.
    </p>
<p>
     And Rio couldn't have loved her more for it if she tried.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had fallen asleep with a couple of hours left in the flight. She was considerably less grumpy when Agatha gently nudged her awake, pressing a kiss to the space between her eyebrows.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Look outside, my love,"
     </em>
     She had coaxed, casting her eyes to the small round window to Rio's right.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio released a low grumble as she sat up, rubbing at her eye before she could shift her gaze to where Agatha had indicated. She scooted over a little so that she could see better and when the view outside became clear?
    </p>
<p>
     It took Rio a moment to process it, to understand that the bright white she saw for miles and miles as the plane lowered in its approach was
     <em>
      snow.
     </em>
     A lot of snow.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though she had been entirely aware that she was going to be seeing snow for the very first time on that trip, actually seeing it stretched out in an expanse in that capacity was breathtaking and the idea that she would get to see it up close and personal excited her even further. There were some people who lived with it, who experienced it with frequency. Agatha had indicated such a history when she talked about growing up in eastern America, but Rio? Rio had known heat and sun and humid rain all of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment the door of the jet opened and they stepped outside, the temperature nearly drew every bit of breath straight from Rio's lungs. It was a chill she had never known before, a coldness that seeped deep within her in only a matter of seconds. What she realized, though, was that it was
     <em>
      thrilling.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She had been nervous about how she would fare in such temperatures, but in those first few moments as they crossed the tarmac to their awaiting car, she had a feeling she might actually like it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's wonder had never left her as they drove toward Reykjavik, Agatha's hand fastened tightly in her own as she stared out the window, the beauty of the glistening powder frequently leaving her feeling as though she were breathless. When she would turn to look at Agatha, that same wonder seemed to bubble up even more.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had taken the reigns in regard to planning this honeymoon and Rio had let her. She had been entirely too occupied by finishing her work project as well as trying to remain in her skin despite the anticipation toward their wedding day that had been trying to rip her clean out of it. Rio had never doubted her, and had been excited at the suggestion of Iceland, but something in Rio was already far too aware that every choice Agatha had made, she'd done so to put a smile on Rio's face.
    </p>
<p>
     Thus far, it was working.
    </p>
<p>
     In fact, it went far beyond that as they rolled through a small community of different cottages and homes, juxtaposed in strange ways based on the elevation of certain pieces of land that put some homes up higher than the others. When the pulled into the drive of one that had a lower placing, Rio's eyes lifted to the structure and for just a moment, they stung.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the only building like it, and while it did not look exactly the same, the angled and sharp features of the home Agatha had chosen for them to spend the next two weeks looked an awful lot like the one she'd bought them in New Zealand. There weren't as many windows -- much to Rio's disappointment -- but the appearance of the house with its geometrical design and pleated wooden exterior reminded her so fondly of
     <em>
      home.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It was intentional. Of course it was intentional. Of course Agatha had come across this house in her planning and known that it was the right one. She was nothing if not sentimental and in those moments, Rio was so thankful for just how tender Agatha's heart could be sometimes.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I didn't want you to get homesick with such a different climate,"
     </em>
     Agatha supplied in a gentle murmur that graced Rio's ear with the proximity provided by how she leaned in over her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's perfect, Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio responded, turning her head so that she could gift her wife a soft kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     The car rolled to a stop and Agatha thanked the driver, assuring him that she would add an additional tip via the app once they were inside. This compelled more assistance from him as he climbed out of the vehicle and helped them carry the majority of their things to the door. With another word of thanks, he departed and Agatha punched in a code above the door handle. There was the softest sound of whirring and then the click of the lock as it released.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon entering, Rio was utterly stunned by the beauty held within the interior of the home. It was clean and for every white surface in their own home, it was black in that one. There
     <em>
      were
     </em>
     large windows that had not been visible from their approach that cornered and met the far wall only in a break that housed a large and wide stone fireplace with a television mounted above it.
    </p>
<p>
     "This is... beautiful," Rio commented as she pulled the door shut once all of their belongings were inside.
    </p>
<p>
     "Let's take a tour," came Agatha's suggestion the moment she shed the coat she had donned when they'd arrived at the airport. After hanging it, she held out a hand for Rio's and did the same with it as well before she linked their fingers together and gave a tug of encouragement to lead them further into the home.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had already developed an idea on what it was going to look like, but each room was almost more breathtaking than the one before it. The kitchen was open and immaculate in its grey and black appearance, the lounge was contemporary but looked like a place they could spend many nights curled up on the couch relaxing and enjoying the first couple of weeks of married life.
    </p>
<p>
     There were four bedrooms, though the master had easily been Rio's favorite. The way the elongated windows let in just the right amount of light felt familiar and there was a sense of hominess that was induced by the floral artwork on the walls. They had returned downstairs, but Agatha was not done. Instead, she pulled on Rio's hand as she paced toward the back of the house.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched with mild curiosity as Agatha opened the sliding glass door and tugged her outside, beaming with a grin that wrinkled the corners of her eyes. Her hand flew out in indication, causing Rio's attention to turn.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a hottub.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, Agatha was going to be absolutely rotten the next two weeks.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was excited for it, nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
     "You did that on purpose, didn't you?" she asked when they stepped back inside and Agatha slid the door shut.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean, I didn't go looking for it..." Agatha returned, though as she faced Rio, her still present grin had turned a bit sheepish. "But when I saw it was there, it was kind of the deal-sealer."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio stepped into her, arms wrapping snugly around Agatha's middle as she leaned in to take a firm and intentional kiss, one that tried to convey her gratitude, her appreciation, and most of all her love.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well," she mused as she pulled back to look into those consistently stunning blue eyes, her lips curling into a warm smile, "you did good, beautiful. And that absurdly large bed in the master is absolutely calling our names for a nap. What do you think?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's bottom lip jutted out in a pout at the same time her hands landed on Rio's biceps.
    </p>
<p>
     "The first thing you wanna do in that bed is nap?" Agatha asked, almost in a whine.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     "My gods, woman. Your appetite is insatiable," Rio breathed at her, taking another kiss though it was still a bit too soft to be considered enticing.
    </p>
<p>
     "Have you seen you? And every time I see that rock on your finger, I have to go to war with myself every time so I don't jump you on the spot." Agatha's touch started to shift, to slide so that she could cage the sides of Rio's neck between her palms, looking across the inches between them into her eyes. Her expression softened and that flame in her gaze seemed to dull a little in a show of self-restraint. "But really... A nap sounds amazing. It's..." Agatha glanced over her shoulder at the time displayed on the microwave before turning back to Rio, "eleven here. We can catch a few hours and then... I may have already booked us an appointment for this evening to do the thing we discussed a few weeks ago."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio's eyes widened slightly. She knew exactly what Agatha was talking about.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd shared in a conversation about a month before the wedding about tattoos. Neither of them had any but, as they had discovered in the throes of their talk, they had both always wanted at least one. Agatha had not simply because she'd always had trouble with the idea of commitment and getting ink branded into her skin was a lifelong one. Rio had not because she was afraid she would not choose something with enough meaning.
    </p>
<p>
     So they'd had a discussion about it for a couple of hours. At the end of that discussion, they had made their decision.
    </p>
<p>
     They were going to get tattoos of origami flowers.
    </p>
<p>
     They had considered briefly the possibility of just going and doing it before the wedding, but it simply had not fit into their busy schedules in a way that would have worked for them. So... Agatha had done what Agatha did best and she took a meaningful idea and gave it even more meaning by scheduling it to happen on the first night of their honeymoon.
    </p>
<p>
     Gods be damned, Rio loved that woman.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're really getting them? Tonight?" Rio asked, her grin sweeping across her face like a flash.
    </p>
<p>
     "We are," Agatha confirmed with a nod, tilting her head just enough that she could press a kiss to the tip of Rio's nose. "I booked us with a delightful woman I spoke to a few days ago named Sædís and she said she's very excited based on the references I sent via email. I also looked over her extensive portfolio before I called."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio exhaled a breathy chuckle. Everything Agatha did, she did it only after extensive research and vetting. Well, almost everything.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio supposed their relationship would always be an exception to that.
    </p>
<p>
     There was beauty to be found in chaos sometimes, no?
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you think..." Rio posed, her head tipping to her right slightly as her lips wound together in thought. Agatha was looking back at her like she was waiting, eager to hear whatever question Rio might ask her right then. Another moment passed and Rio finally continued. "...that there will ever come a day where you don't completely blow me away?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips curled up warmly and her palms slid higher, cradling the corners of Rio's jaw delicately.
    </p>
<p>
     "If there does..." Agatha mused back, leaning in to take an untempered but unhurried kiss. She pulled back and Rio found herself diving headlong into those blue pools, carried away by the fluttering of her heart in her chest.
     <em>
      "I would understand if you made me sleep on the couch."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's giggles were immediate as they passed through her lips only for as long as it took for her to close the space between them, sealing their lips flush.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe it was the general feeling of knowing that they were officially married, that they were on their honeymoon, that they had come to the peak of this momentous turning point in their lives that had Rio feeling the desperation for physical closeness. Maybe it wasn't. Or, at least, if it was, Agatha was feeling the exact same way.
    </p>
<p>
     It was this aura that had settled over them, one of completely euphoric jubilation. It felt like the warmest embrace on the coldest night. They had one another and only one another in the way they were sealing themselves off from the outside world for just a little while. For the first time since those wobbly beginnings of their relationship, they had reached a suitable point where they could place their outside lives on pause and exist in a universe built for the two of them, and only the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Come on,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured, stealing one last peck before she released her hold around Agatha and supplemented it by taking her hand instead as she led them back through the house to gather some of their things.
    </p>
<p>
     They climbed the stairs and tucked inside the master where Rio was immediate in opening her duffel to root through so she could procure something more comfortable to sleep in. As she pulled out a t-shirt and plaid shorts, she heard the softest sounds of shuffling behind her not a second before she felt Agatha's hands on either side of her waist.
    </p>
<p>
     The smell of her perfume hit Rio before her lips did on the back of Rio's head. It was the soft question she murmured into the hair there that had
     <em>
      truly
     </em>
     been unexpected.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Can I undress you... And help you get dressed for our nap?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     There was only about four to six seconds where Rio was a rational human being. Immediately following, she dissolved into nothing more than a heap of an adored and loved human. Agatha could use the fewest words to make the boldest statements and that moment, it had never been closer to the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     One of Agatha's love languages was acts of service. That had made itself prevalent throughout the entirety of the time they had known one another, but right then it nearly broke Rio in the best way. The request she had first started with could have been misconstrued easily. It was her addendum that caressed every inch of Rio's heart as it beat for Agatha in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just wanted to engage in a simple but still intimate act. It was an act that did not have to end in sex, but could still radiate that very intimacy with ease.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Yes, my love. I think I would quite like that."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio lowered the items in her hands and laid them atop the duffel she had just pulled them from as she felt Agatha's lips press to the back of her head again. At roughly the same time, she felt her wife's fingers wind into the fabric of her shirt. The moment she slowly lifted it up Rio's body, her arms raised to assist in the removal. Before it even hit the floor, Agatha's arms wrapped firmly around her middle and she could feel as those kisses landed on her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     They began to travel, feather light as they headed toward Rio's spine and then down it, stopping between her shoulder blades to breath a whispered inquiry.
     <em>
      "Do you want to keep your bra on?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes slid shut as her head tipped back slightly.
     <em>
      "Yes, please,"
     </em>
     she answered, trying not to sound nearly as breathless as she felt. Agatha did these little things, things that might not have meant much to anyone else, but to Rio they were everything. Agatha thought about
     <em>
      everything
     </em>
     and took absolutely
     <em>
      everything
     </em>
     into consideration in the infinite caverns of her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could see that so wholly because while she was not Agatha's everything, she
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     the center of her universe based only on the way Agatha treated her.
    </p>
<p>
     With a deft but ginger precision, Agatha unfastened the buttons on Rio's jeans and gently pushed them down her legs enough so that they fell to pool around her ankles. She could feel Agatha's eyes on her as she took only a moment to indulge in silent worship because it was clear she had snapped her attention back to completeing the task she had asked to begin.
    </p>
<p>
     The smooth fabric of Agatha's shirt brushed the skin of Rio's back as she leaned forward and reached around so that she could grab the clothing items Rio had selected for herself. First was the shorts that Agatha held up in front of the woman before her, kneeling slightly so that it was easier for her to step into them. Once they were fitted around Rio's hips, Agatha placed a loving kiss to her shoulder before reaching around to pull the t-shirt up as well.
    </p>
<p>
     It was easy to feel the patience, the love, the utter devotion that Agatha was feeling just by the way she was touching Rio, kissing her skin. They could be wild, sometimes downright feral in their physical attraction for one another, but that typical urgency was vacant from every contact that was made between their bodies.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, there was affection there as Agatha helped thread Rio's arms through the holes in the shirt and then pulled it up so that her head popped through, too. The moment she was suited for their respite, Agatha's arms were folding around her middle again and her mystified admission came in a whisper right next to Rio's ear.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I can't believe you're my wife."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's exhausted grin was slow, but it eventually pushed her cheeks into peaks at hearing those words coming from Agatha's lips.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Believe it, my love. We've got quite a bit of time ahead of us for it to sink in."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha relinquished her hold with one more kiss to the side of Rio's head. When Rio turned around, she didn't offer any form of protest as Agatha stripped her shirt over her head to change, too. No, that had been Agatha's moment. That had been a fulfillment of something she had wanted to do
     <em>
      for
     </em>
     Rio and based on the way she shucked her own jeans and finished changing, Rio was almost certain that Agatha did not
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     her to offer a return of the gesture.
    </p>
<p>
     No matter the bed, no matter the location, they always found their way to their designated sides but directly in the middle.
    </p>
<p>
     Not moments after Rio's head had landed on Agatha's chest and she felt the small and light shapes Agatha started to trace on her back, Rio had slipped easily into sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Hours later when the ringing bells of Agatha's alarm sounded in the silence around them, Rio felt more rested than she had thought she might. She had come-to in the exact same place she'd fallen asleep and only shifted when Agatha stretched over to silence her alarm.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's arm tightened around her and Rio could feel the lightest brush of lips against her hairline.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Did you have a happy nap, my love?"
     </em>
     Agatha hummed against her scalp.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I did. I think I am well-rested enough that the idea of getting stabbed multiple times isn't as intimidating as it was when you first told me you'd booked the appointment."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     At this, a hearty laugh low in volume echoed out of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "When you put it like that, it makes it sound like you're volunteering to be in a slasher film,"
     </em>
     she teased in an airy murmur.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio snuggled a little closer, holding herself a little tighter to Agatha's form as her eyes slid closed again, just reveling in the closeness and warmth the moment had bestowed upon her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I don't know a great deal about getting tattooed,"
     </em>
     Rio began lowly,
     <em>
      "but I feel like it would probably be a good idea to get something to eat before we go."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Without skipping a beat, Agatha formed her response.
    </p>
<p>
     "I had the same thought," she divulged, her voice a little louder the more her consciousness seemed to take hold. "So I went online a couple of minutes after you fell asleep and got us a reservation at a place called Rok. The menu looks good and it's close to the tattoo shop."
    </p>
<p>
     "And you know I implicitly trust your judgement?" Rio goaded sarcastically as she lifted her head, basking in the complete emotion she found in Agatha's expression when she looked down at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You say that like you actually don't," Agatha poked back, cocking a brow in challenge.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, they both laughed. They laughed for seconds that turned into minutes, the softest symphony of their uninhibited joy.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd spent another few moments enjoying the closeness before Agatha made the most Agatha suggestion, one that Rio would have never turned down.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Will you shower with me?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It was the second time in mere hours that Agatha was asking Rio to let her shower her in the emotion that was clearly overflowing out of her. It was her honest way of channeling it, and even more than that, Rio knew that by engaging, she was also feeding a part of Agatha's soul that sought the approval and praise that would come with being so wholly devoted.
    </p>
<p>
     That shower, in Rio's mind -- though she did not actually voice the thought to Agatha -- was so heavily reminiscent of the first one they had shared in the Freehand. It was so slow, so tender. There were kisses to wet skin, fingertips kneading into taut muscle. It, again, wasn't sexual in the demeanor by any measure and yet was so, so loud with intimacy.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they had dried off, changed and met the car at the curb to make their way into the city, Rio could start to feel the nerves building in her stomach at the idea of getting a tattoo. She knew it really wasn't such a big deal, but it was the intention behind it. She
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to be branded with a mark that would forever bring Agatha to the forefront of her mind when she looked at it. She
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to bear a small token of the other woman's existence on her own skin.
    </p>
<p>
     The restaurant Agatha had selected had been quaint and sweet, and Rio found herself with a developing yearning to study a bit about the Icelandic language. Most people they came into contact were kind enough to indulge them in speaking English, but in the moments where Rio could overhear a conversation at the adjacent table, or when they passed by?
    </p>
<p>
     It was fascinating, something that piqued her interest in a way few things did.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha checked the time and then pulled out her phone, looking something up. Once she'd satiated her quest for knowledge, she stowed her phone and got to her feet. In a way Rio was all too familiar with, she held out her hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "We can walk to the shop. It's about eight minutes from here and the appointment is in fifteen," Agatha offered her the moment their hands were linked.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though it had been only an eight minute walk, Rio had loved every single minute there was to be hand. Iceland was so... different. It was in the way the snow piled in little spots at the edges of the streets. It was in the mostly white exteriors of so many of the buildings. There was a homey air about the section of the city they found themselves in and Rio could have found solace in the idea of just getting lost there.
    </p>
<p>
     She would make idle comments about a shop front, or how she wondered what a sign meant even though she couldn't read it. Agatha was steadfast by her side, the most contented curling of her lips seemingly frozen into her features.
    </p>
<p>
     When they had arrived at the tattoo shop and met the young woman Agatha had spoken to, Rio understood what Agatha had meant when she had called her delightful. Once they followed her back to her work area and she shared the design she had worked up for them, Rio had almost cried.
    </p>
<p>
     It would be no bigger than a few inches wide by a few inches tall, but it was almost an exact replication of the flower that Agatha had left on the houseboat her first night there. When Sædís had asked about color, Rio had been the first to volunteer her selection.
    </p>
<p>
     "Purple," she had said instantly, but then followed with only one qualifier. "A lighter shade preferred."
    </p>
<p>
     When the woman had turned her gaze upon Agatha, Agatha answered her so brightly that Rio could
     <em>
      hear
     </em>
     the love in such a response.
    </p>
<p>
     "As close to a hunter green as you can get. Not plussed if it swings a little one way or the other."
    </p>
<p>
     Sædís disappeared for a few moments and returned with two copies of the stencil. Once it had garnered approval from both women, she had asked which of them would be going first and it had only taken the extra couple of seconds of Rio's hesitation for Agatha to take the plunge.
    </p>
<p>
     Sitting there next to her wife, feeling every single time Agatha's grip restricted around her hand as the woman on the other side of her carefully etched an important piece of their history into her skin, Rio couldn't have been more in love.
    </p>
<p>
     It was no secret that they were pretty close to the mid-way point in their lives. It was also no secret that meeting one another had instilled a youthful vibrance to their lives that they wanted to exist in forever. Maybe they were in their forties -- Rio tried not to point out the distinction after Agatha's 50th birthday earlier in the year because she quickly realized it was still taking some time to settle without being an irritation -- and getting their first tattoos, but so what?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought simply that she'd never had the reason or motivation to do so before. Now she had both.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's really not that bad," Agatha commented over half-way through the process. "Feels like being stung by a bee a lot."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio laughed, rolling her eyes. "You're not exactly being encouraging," she teased, bringing Agatha's hand up to kiss at her knuckles.
    </p>
<p>
     Toward the end, Agatha had gotten chatty. She had started talking about the kids, about wondering what they were doing. She rambled on about them hanging out with the Landons probably and how they would likely throw some kind of rager in their absence. That had been hilarious to Rio because they both knew that was the unlikeliest of all scenarios imaginable. It was just Agatha's way of chittering through the ache that had likely developed the longer the process wore on.
    </p>
<p>
     Sædís leaned back and shut the machine off, setting it down to grab the bottle of soap that sat on her station. With a light squeeze, she wet Agatha's skin with it and gave a firm swipe of a paper towel over it. What was revealed the moment she completed the motion left Rio's eyes glassy even seeing it from the angle of where she was sitting.
    </p>
<p>
     It was beautiful. That origami flower, the same one Agatha had left her, but in Rio's color.
    </p>
<p>
     When she obtained the ability to tear her eyes from it, they swept up to Agatha who was already grinning at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's good?" she asked, clearly seeking affirmation.
    </p>
<p>
     "Very good. I love it." Rio glanced back down at it for a moment before meeting Agatha eye-to-eye again. She gave her hand a firm squeeze. "I love
     <em>
      you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio watched curiously as the artist applied a thin film over the fresh ink and explained what it was and how it worked. It was essentially like an extra layer of skin, one that would keep the tattoo protected from any irritants.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's first question had been so on brand for who she was at her very core and it had caused Rio to nearly choke on her laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is it protective enough that I can get into... a body of water?"
    </p>
<p>
     The way she had asked it, coupled with Rio's laughter made the woman chuckle, too, just before she confirmed that yes, swimming with saniderm was acceptable.
    </p>
<p>
     In the time it took her to get her station cleaned up and re-prepped so that Rio could take her place next, she and Agatha had marveled at the ink on her body in the mirror. It was emotional in a way that Rio wasn't going to let herself feel in public, but she had been unable to help the way she turned Agatha's chin toward her so she could meet that familiar and warm gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm really glad we're doing this. I... I'm also really glad that you push me to do things I wouldn't normally choose for myself. Because... as it turns out, growing into the person that makes these choices is the same person that loves you for presenting them as options." Rio was being honest; she had spent so long isolated from personal growth in so many aspects of her life and it had limited her potential, potential that only ever could have been brought forth by the endless love Agatha had for her.
    </p>
<p>
     Next, it was Rio's turn.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd been placed side to side so that Sædís could line up the placing evenly. Once she removed the paper from the stencil, Rio hadn't been able to keep herself from grinning at the way the two flowers looked next to each other on their hips, even before her own was actually imbued upon her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Sædís called them back over and Rio slid atop the same padded chair that Agatha had been in roughly twenty minutes prior. In turn, Agatha was at her side, both hands wrapped strongly around Rio's in her show of support.
    </p>
<p>
     The woman lifted her head and met Rio with a warm smile. "Are you ready?"
    </p>
<p>
     Wordlessly, Rio gave a nod and let her head rest against the padding on the chair behind her. When the other woman sensed that she exhaled the deep breath she'd taken, Rio felt it the moment the needle hit her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't unbearable, but it was sharp and insistent. Immediately, she understood Agatha's need to have conversation to try and distract herself.  Rio, on the other hand, remained rather quiet throughout the process, just watching the woman as she worked on her left hip, as opposed to Agatha's right.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been so quiet that Agatha had checked on more than one occasion that she was doing alright. Rio would roll her head over to look at her and meet her with the same sweet smile and an affirmation that she was okay. Agatha, all three times she asked, would simply lean in for a gentle kiss, another showing of solidarity.
    </p>
<p>
     In very similar motions, Sædís finished and cleaned the new brand on Rio's skin, allowing them a look before she placed the saniderm over that one, as well. Once the application was finished, the Sædís suggested that they get another view of what they looked like next to each other now that both were finished.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment they stepped in front of the mirror, hips bared to show their newly acquired art, Rio felt those emotionally driven tears as they coated the surface of her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     They were beautiful. They were art. They were so
     <em>
      Agatha and Rio.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Her head lifted to look at the woman by her side and for what felt like the millionth time in the last week alone, all she saw was every ounce of love within the confines of Agatha's body as it wrote itself across her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned toward her, pressing their lips together before she straightened back up. Her gaze never left Rio's though, and she finally spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "Forever my soft place to land."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew one thing for absolute certain:
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha could not have been more correct about any other fact in the universe even if she tried.

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Estee is going to lose her mind. She's been trying to convince me to get a tattoo since the first one she got when she was eighteen," Rio divulged. She looked up from her bowl of skyr -- an Icelandic snack that closely resembled yogurt -- and berries to watch as Agatha dropped a handful of berries into hers as well from her place across the island countertop.
    </p>
<p>
     "I guess I'm just more convincing," Agatha returned with an unbothered shrug. It almost reeked of indifference and Rio knew that Agatha was not capable of such when it came to their family. This was proven true the moment her face nearly cracked in a grin, her eyes sparkling with her shenanigans.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're not
     <em>
      wrong
     </em>
     , but I think she'll understand anyway. I did mean it when I told her that I couldn't decide on something with enough meaning to force my hand," Rio tried to explain, as if Agatha would have formed any kind of disapproval anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted her head and stuck her spoon in her mouth, upside down so that it cupped her tongue and at the same time, tilted her head to the side. The sight, as Rio took it in, was overwhelming in the most adorable and fulfilling way.
    </p>
<p>
     That was
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     wife. It was
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     wife that was standing there looking so impossibly cute that Rio had no fathomable way to deal with it.
     <em>
      Rio's
     </em>
     wife was the one who had arranged this entire honeymoon. They weren't even a full day in and Rio already thought it couldn't be any more perfect.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to be struck by the look on Rio's face, enough so that she lowered the spoon, looking almost guilty.
    </p>
<p>
     "What is it?" she asked, her voice a gentle hum.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was blinking, shaking her head of the haze she had allowed herself to slip into. An easy smile curled her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Just thinking about how much I love you," Rio answered, that airy and tender tone so warm as it floated across the space between them.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment it hit Agatha's ears, her shoulders dropped and she was grinning again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, then proceed. But don't forget the keep the audience informed. We love to hear it."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did and said these things sometimes, much like in that moment, where Rio couldn't help but wonder:
     <em>
      How the hell am I the one standing here?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She was of the complete awareness that if she asked such a question out loud? Agatha would readily provide any and all answers without a moment's hesitation. Rio knew it would go as far back as her insane inclination to track down a stranger and could only ever evolve from there. It hadn't even been a full year since the day they'd met and yet, they had experienced so much. They had endured equally as much.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead of leaving her wanting, Rio formed a response.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's kind of like the idea that time is an illusion. In the same way, I think my capacity to love you is an illusion, too. Just... in the sense that there's no structure, no capability of confinement. Nothing can house
     <em>
      that much
     </em>
     feeling on any plane of existence." The way Rio said it, it was like citing critical theory, but the contents and context of what she was trying to convey clearly struck Agatha straight in the chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched, almost in slow-motion as Agatha's expression melted like a popsicle on a hot summer's day, her eyes glassing over with the emotion such words had brought forth. As Rio began to try and justify what she had said, she realized she did not need to. Agatha was already moving, already whipping her way around that counter.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment she was close enough, Rio could sense it before she felt it, the comforting and familiar touch of Agatha's hand curling around the side of her neck. She turned her head the rest of the way just in time to catch Agatha's lips with her own, a deeply sentimental and emotional kiss that was still so light and careful.
    </p>
<p>
     There was something else there. Rio felt it. When Agatha pulled away, she saw it too.
    </p>
<p>
     There were clouds in those beautiful blue eyes, though the lightning had not yet begun to crackle.
    </p>
<p>
     Something wasn't
     <em>
      wrong
     </em>
     , but it didn't feel
     <em>
      right
     </em>
     , either.
    </p>
<p>
     Watching Agatha, even before her lips started worrying against one another, Rio sensed that there was something Agatha was holding onto. It felt like something that, for once, Rio did not already know.
    </p>
<p>
     "There's something I have to tell you... About yesterday..." Agatha disclosed, her voice low. Timid, almost.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's expression pinched in uncertainty.
    </p>
<p>
     "As in... Our wedding day, that yesterday?" Rio questioned, tone laden with her confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha just nodded. The way she then looked over at her bowl, hesitating for just a moment before she let go of Rio's neck so she could lean across the island to grab it, it was this sudden shift in demeanor that Rio was trying to catch up with. Agatha looked back down at her and gave a tip of her head in indication that they should relocate to somewhere more comfortable.
    </p>
<p>
     Suddenly, Rio felt strange. She trusted Agatha implicitly... clearly. But it was like it was like Agatha had shifted from the highest gear to the lowest in the blink of an eye and it left Rio fumbling to sort it out.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio did not understand was that what she had said and how she had said it had reminded Agatha that there was to be no stone left unturned in terms of how they communicated with each other.
    </p>
<p>
     She got to her feet and slipped one hand into Agatha's while cradling her bowl in the other, following a step behind her wife as they relocated to the living space, tucking into one of the large sofas there. For just a moment, Rio held her bowl in her lap. After that moment, she put it on the coffee table, having lost complete interest in it.
    </p>
<p>
     She brought up a leg to bend at the knee as she turned ninety degrees to face Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright," Rio soothed, reaching for her hand again, giving it a firm squeeze. "This isn't like you... What's going on, my love?"
    </p>
<p>
     In that ever-so-classic Agatha way, her lips pressed together as those gears in her brain began to turn. "Do you..." she attempted, but her lips pressed shut again. "Do you remember when you, Dave, Jack and I were all talking... And I excused myself?" Agatha was looking down at their hands. She was not looking Rio in the eyes and Rio absolutely did not like that.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes," Rio returned, though that wasn't the end of it. "But before you keep going, will you please look at me?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips turned down at the corners so fast that it forced Rio to make a choice of her own. She let go of Agatha's hand and reached up, fingertips gracing her far cheek.
     <em>
      Please,
     </em>
     that soft and delicate touch seemed to shout,
     <em>
      please look at me.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was suddenly worried. What the hell could Agatha possibly be remembering that was upsetting her this deeply?
    </p>
<p>
     After a moment too long, Agatha finally turned her head. She looked
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     upset.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha..."
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm sorry I'm just now telling you... I should have said something last night, or even earlier today. I just... I wasn't thinking about it because I was so happy." Agatha's tone had wavered at first, but she seemed to find her resolve. As much as Rio loved her, the anxiety was beginning to win her over in the worst way. Thankfully, Agatha continued before it could sink her.
    </p>
<p>
     "My ex-husband showed up during the reception."
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, so Rio hadn't been expecting
     <em>
      that.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     But... It made sense. It explained why Agatha was suddenly so perturbed, why she seemed so unsettled. Very rarely had Rio ever witnessed her in a state where it looked like she could have crawled out of her skin, but with such a deliverance, she understood every bit of it.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio did not immediately ask
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     Agatha hadn't told her, something settled in Agatha's deep azure gaze. What Rio
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     ask caused that glassy film over them to return.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "And how did that make you feel?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha blinked at her for a moment, and by the fourth blink, a lone tear had rolled down her cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     Had she thought Rio was going to be angry? Had she thought that Rio would feel betrayed, or like Agatha had lied to her? What had she thought Rio's reaction would be? More over, why had she thought it would be anything other than compassion?
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I... It... It made me so
      <b>
       angry.
      </b>
      "
     </em>
     In spite of how quiet Agatha's voice was, Rio could hear that statement very clearly. It was an understandable feeling, something that made too much sense to have ever been anything else.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "And you handled it,"
     </em>
     Rio affirmed. Her thumb began to move, creating the softest caress just below Agatha's eye.
     <em>
      "Do you want to talk about
      <b>
       how
      </b>
      you handled it, or do you want to table this conversation for another time when you're not so upset with yourself?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The confusion, this time, was Agatha's to wear. She had just dropped this huge bomb of a fact that she had not disclosed in their newlywed state, and there Rio sat, as patient and understanding as she ever was. It was because Rio knew that these things Agatha was telling her were facts.
    </p>
<p>
     Colton had shown up to their private wedding. It had made Agatha angry. Agatha had gotten him to leave.
    </p>
<p>
     Those were the facts.
    </p>
<p>
     Everything else, that was emotional kindling. Indulging those emotions when Agatha was already beating herself up would do neither of them any good. While Rio knew herself and her own ability to digest and comprehend, Agatha was still learning.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been nearly eight months; yes, they had covered a lot of ground and Rio could confidently say she knew no other human the way she knew Agatha, but there were
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     going to be new things to discover. Maybe Agatha understood that she was going to be there, and truly mean it when she said it, but what she had yet to fully grasp was that Rio was just...
     <em>
      so understanding
     </em>
     , in the most true and raw form.
    </p>
<p>
     They would fight, yes, that was to be expected, but Rio would always be the kind of person who picked those battles wisely. Right then was not ever going to be the time to choose a fight. The last thing she was going to let happen was for the first night of their honeymoon devolve in any kind of fracture between them.
    </p>
<p>
     That was a lesson she was teaching Agatha on the spot. One that seemed to be sinking in.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Can we talk about it later?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     In all their time together, Rio was almost certain she had never heard a question so small come from the woman she loved. All she could do to provide an answer was lean forward, kissing her softly.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Of course, my love. Why don't we finish our snack and get ready for bed?"
     </em>
     There was simply no way for Rio to be other than empathetic in those moment. She loved Agatha and she could see that she was clearly poking holes in herself to try and find a reason why she hadn't spoken up sooner, but Rio honestly could not have cared less.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was frustrated with herself because she'd let it slip her mind. Rio would never be angry because it had still been within forty-eight hours, give or take, that Agatha had brought it to her. They could discuss the implications later. For now, it was no longer sitting heavy on Agatha's chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Another moment of silence passed between them, but Rio's gentle touch on Agatha's cheek never stopped moving.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You're
      <b>
       my
      </b>
      wife, huh?"
     </em>
     Agatha breathed, tone and eyes both wondrous and filled with affection.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Yes,"
     </em>
     Rio whispered back in confirmation, leaning forward to kiss Agatha again. "
     <em>
      And you're
      <b>
       my
      </b>
      wife. Which makes me the luckier of the two of us."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha might have tried to roll her eyes and argue, but Rio kissed her in order to prevent that from happening. It was patient, it was understanding. It was permission to let it go for now. When Agatha moved, breaking the contact, her head turned enough that she could kiss Rio's cheek.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you."
     </em>
     Agatha sounded so honest, like she couldn't have been telling the truth more if she tried.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I know you do. 'Cause, I may be insane for it,"
     </em>
     Rio teased, a sly smile finding her face,
     <em>
      "but I so wholly love you too."
     </em>
     She pulled away and gave Agatha's thigh a loving pat and leaned forward to pick her bowl back up. She shifted to place her feet back to the floor and focused her energy on the food in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had not missed the way Agatha pressed their hips closer together, the way she had soldiered the sides of their thighs together in a tight line, the way Rio could feel the lean muscle of Agatha's bicep as it nearly melted into her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio realized it was
     <em>
      finally
     </em>
     starting to sink in to that thick skull of Agatha's. This was it. These were the first days of the rest of their lives and Rio was committed, full stop. It had become clear to Rio over the course of their relationship that no one else in Agatha's life ever could have managed something so grand, simply because Agatha would have never let them.
    </p>
<p>
     It could have only ever been Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they had finished, Rio rinsed their bowls and Agatha had gathered the bottle of champagne that had been left for them -- per Agatha's request -- in the refrigerator. Her free hand just barely brushed the small of Rio's back  as she passed by in her quest to locate champagne flutes, causing the lightest sheet of goosebumps to flare over nearly every inch of her skin. Rio chuckled gently as she found them in the fourth cabinet she tried.
    </p>
<p>
     After draining over half the bottle in bed, Rio had found herself with her head on Agatha's stomach, a fingertip tracing a consistent line above the waistband of her sleep shorts, soft violet cotton bunched from the way she had it tied. She may have been touching that patch of skin, but it was only because she couldn't touch the one she wanted to be touching.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to know if it would feel different, to touch that inked part of Agatha's skin. Would she be able to feel the love that had been poured into the gesture? Would she be able to feel the intention there that tied them together for the rest of their lives? Or would it still feel like Agatha's skin, familiar and comforting?
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe it could be all of that at one time.
    </p>
<p>
     Between the jetlag, their mildly busy day, the champagne, and the crash from the adrenaline rush she'd gotten earlier in the day upon the beginning of the tattoo, Rio had fallen asleep in minutes once she had settled into that position.
    </p>
<p>
     While
     <em>
      falling
     </em>
     asleep had been easy,
     <em>
      staying
     </em>
     asleep had not.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had woken up some time in the middle of the night, Agatha's arm draped over her middle from behind her. She was snoring soundly, clearly enjoying the deep sleep their exhaustion had brought with it.
    </p>
<p>
     She had thought, for about ten minutes, that she could go back to sleep. Ten minutes dissolved into thirty. Then they evaporated into an hour.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was staring at the expanse of navy and purple sky that was painted on the other side of that window before her. It was too cold to go outside, but it was still breathtaking even with her head on the pillow inside that warm home.
    </p>
<p>
     It made her think.
    </p>
<p>
     It made Rio think about how big the world was. It made her think about the sheer randomness that had been the day she had met Agatha. It made her think about how downtrodden she had become in those following weeks. It made her think about what it had felt like at the foot of those stone steps as Agatha had run straight into her to kiss her for a second time.
    </p>
<p>
     It made her think how, in contrast, it felt to kiss her in front of fifty other people who cheered them on and supported the love that they had.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, how far they had come.
    </p>
<p>
     One hour became two. Then, the sun came up. Rio had thought of so many things, from the way their phones had been put on do-not-disturb to wondering how the kids were doing and almost wanting to know bad enough that she was willing to break that do-not-disturb rule they had made.
    </p>
<p>
     She had stayed in bed, cuddled with her sleeping Agatha, for as long as she could manage. Her bones grew restless eventually and she carefully pulled herself out of bed, doing her best to not wake her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     In one of Agatha's t-shirts and her boy short underwear, Rio made her way downstairs and made a cup of coffee using the Keurig that the home had been furnished with. Twenty minutes later, she made another. By the end of the third cup, she found herself thinking about one thing.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't just the tattoo. It wasn't even the symbolism of the origami flowers.
    </p>
<p>
     It was what had been written inside.
    </p>
<p>
     It was how that very note was still with her everywhere of importance she went. Currently, it was tucked inside the pages of the copy of The Tenth Circle by Jodi Picoult she had picked up a few weeks prior.
    </p>
<p>
     Where Rio stayed, that note stayed. It was forever a reminder of the way Agatha saw her, and would always see her.
    </p>
<p>
     By 9 am, Rio had retrieved the card they had been given the day before as well as her book and returned to the kitchen. She typed out a short but succinct email to the tattoo artist and asked if she had anything available that day. She also added in the photo of what she wanted, exactly, in the form of that post-it note as it laid on the counter. It had taken only twenty minutes for a response, one that held the promise of an early afternoon cancellation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had snatched it up.
    </p>
<p>
     The appointment time was set for noon; that gave her enough time to shower, get ready, order a car and make the trip into town. If she could slip out before Agatha woke up, she might be able to buy herself a little bit of time. So, she set about the steps it would take to get from point a to point b and by the time her hair was dry and she was dressed, her mildly fiendish side was excited that Agatha was still on her stomach, face half buried in her pillow.
    </p>
<p>
     Kneeling on the edge of the bed, Rio leaned over, pressing the lightest kiss to Agatha's cheek and giving her shoulder a gentle shake at the same time. It took a couple of seconds but the sounds of consciousness rumbled out of her with a soft groan.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm going to get us lunch, my love,"
     </em>
     Rio told her, placing one more kiss just below Agatha's temple.
     <em>
      "Go back to sleep."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's dissatisfied grumble came back immediately.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "But I can go with you,"
     </em>
     she tried to reason. Rio's immediate response was the softest gracing of laugher in the form of a breathy chuckle against Agatha's skin, which she explained a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You are exhausted. Get the sleep while you can. You're not getting off as easy tonight,"
     </em>
     Rio offered in a faux threat.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha easily took it as such, her lips sliding back in a sleepy smile.
     <em>
      "Promise?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Cross my heart."
     </em>
     One last kiss, a physical wave of goodbye before the verbal one came.
     <em>
      "I love you. I'll be back soon."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you too. Be careful. And don't bring back that weird fish stuff."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Despite the fact that Rio had been trying to keep her volume on the lighter side, the laughter that spilled out of here was almost enough to shatter the stillness of the room. Agatha didn't seem to care. Her smile just grew as she burrowed a little deeper into the comfort of her pillow, looking every bit the angel Rio thought her to be.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio departed and made her way downstairs to finish preparing for her little solo journey. When she peered out the small window next to the door, she was tickled to see that the car was already at the end of the drive, waiting for her. She pulled on the coat that she knew she would only ever need for this trip and fastened it up, lifting the faux-fur hood over her head to keep any chill away.
    </p>
<p>
     The drive, as she had known it would be, was short, and the moment she opened the door to Moonstone for the second time in twenty-four hours, Sædís lifted her head from whatever she was working on to greet Rio with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     "No compatriot today?" she offered lightly, pushing herself to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio shook her head, though her bright grin was mischievous. "I told her I was getting lunch. This one is a surprise for her."
    </p>
<p>
     "She's the one who wrote it?" the other woman asked back, the sentiment clearly not lost on her.
    </p>
<p>
     "She did, the first day we met. I found it a few days later after I thought I would never see her again. And now, here we are!" Rio explained, though she had to fight the urge not to laugh at how ridiculous it sounded even coming from her lips in a simple explanation. "It's actually what she used for the flower that gave us the idea for yesterday."
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh my god, stop. That's so
     <em>
      krútt,
     </em>
     " Sædís gushed and even though Rio didn't know what, exactly, such a word meant, she had been able to garner enough of an idea from the context in which it was being used, as well as that delighted uptick in her tone. If she had to guess, it meant something akin to 'sweet.'
    </p>
<p>
     Rio followed her back to her station once more to see everything already laid out, stencil ready and all. They had talked back and forth, a little more than the three of them had the evening prior. It wasn't that they'd avoided discussing themselves, but it had been a little more of a business transaction. With familiarity there now, as well as the lack of someone else for Rio to focus on as the needle punched into her skin over and over again, it was just easier to hold conversation to busy her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, Rio had needed the distraction. Sædís had placed the stencil where she had asked, though she mentioned she would be remiss to not inform her that the placing -- just below the heel of Rio's palm on her wrist -- was going to hurt a little more than the one she had received the day before.
    </p>
<p>
     She hadn't been kidding.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a lot smaller, it was only six words, but Sædís indicated that she needed to use the type of needle she had used to do the line work on their flowers, which had been the deeper puncturing one of the two.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the same pain, but different. With the proximity to bone in some places, it was deeper, stung a little more, seeped a little further in. It was still manageable, and it took a lot less time, but the sharp sting was a little more intense.
    </p>
<p>
     Within twenty minutes, Sædís was cleaning it and applying that added layer of protection, practically grinning at her own work. With it being so fresh, that layer of saniderm was no more than a window into Rio's devious little surprise for her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     The way the text had been placed, it was only legible to Rio from an upside-down perspective. She had wanted it that way. She'd
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     it that way for a very specific reason.
    </p>
<p>
     That reason was that while she knew it was what Agatha had claimed her to be, she wanted Agatha to be reminded of it every time Rio held out a hand for her to take.
    </p>
<p>
     It could be a bad day, one where Agatha was up to her eyeballs in paperwork and filings and permits. It could be a sad day where Agatha thought about the darker parts of her life. It could be a day when she was angry and all she wanted to do was push everyone away despite the fact that Rio would never let that happen. It could be a happy day, one that held so many kisses and laughs and embraces.
    </p>
<p>
     Whatever day it was, when Rio took Agatha's hand, she wanted to remember that Rio would always be her soft place to land.
    </p>
<p>
     Always.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had thanked Sædís at least three more times in the process of paying, making sure to add a hefty chunk of gratuity not only for accommodating her on such short notice, but for giving exactly what it was she had needed. They'd only spent a couple of hours together, but the appreciation Rio had for her ran deep.
    </p>
<p>
     They had parted ways and Rio set to her next task of actually acquiring them something to eat. When she stepped outside and pulled her phone out of the puffy coat she'd placed back on her form, she had two text messages from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm up now. Are you almost back?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Rio? You okay?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     A huff of a chuckle passed through Rio's nose, a grin springing to her lips as she texted a response, sending it immediately to staunch any buildup of worry that might have started to consume an Agatha that was left alone in that big bed in that too-big-for-them house.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm fine! Sorry! There's just a long wait time. It shouldn't be much longer. I love you!"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Oh, she was such a shit liar. Maybe it would hold a little better over text.
    </p>
<p>
     In the middle of trying to locate somewhere to go, Agatha texted back.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I meant it about that fish thing. I hear when you open the can, it smells like a dead body. But I love you too. Come home to me soon."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     At this, Rio laughed out loud, not caring that a passerby lifted his head to glance at her as though she were insane. If she was, it was simply because she was just insanely in love with her wife and how ridiculous she could sometimes be.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, she'd found what could pretty much be described as a chip shop and made a beeline straight to it, only taking her a little over ten minutes to get there on foot. Stepping inside, it reminded her so fondly of home; the aroma, the sights, the way the staff behind the counter were buzzing around, tending to friers and refreshing stock.
    </p>
<p>
     She had placed their orders, trying not to laugh to herself all the while that Agatha was going to shriek the moment Rio announced she brought home fish before she clarified what kind she'd actually gotten.
    </p>
<p>
     It would be a little taste of Auckland, thousands and thousands of miles away, so very reminiscent of those nights they'd sat on their houseboat with their children, the smells of fried food and malt vinegar heavy in the air around them. It would be a way to be a little closer to a place Rio had spent a little longer away from than she had ever considered she might. At least before Agatha had toppled into her life.
    </p>
<p>
     While she waited, Rio had ordered a ride share back to the home they were staying in, one she only had to wait a few minutes for once she'd stepped back outside with that white plastic sack that contained their meals dangling from her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time she punched the code into the lock on the front door and pushed it open, her cheeks and the tip of her nose were pink from the cold. The wind blew her hood forward, trying to push it despite the fact that it could go no further with the blockage of her cranium in the way. To stop the gust, she shut the door behind her, blowing out a soft
     <em>
      brrr
     </em>
     as she turned back toward the interior of the home.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, who had been flipping through what appeared to be a magazine, lifted her head at Rio's sudden arrival, a sweet smile finding her with a quickness at the sight of Rio all bundled up and flush from the bite of the air outside.
    </p>
<p>
     "I thought I was going to have to come find you," Agatha informed her though she did not sound worried or upset. Instead, she seemed... relieved.
    </p>
<p>
     "I told you I would be back, my love!" Rio called over her shoulder as she stripped herself of her winter wear, placing it on a hanger and then into the front closet. She picked the bag back up and practically floated over to join Agatha in the kitchen.
    </p>
<p>
     In a role reversal from the night before, Rio had placed herself on the side of the island that did not have the chairs lined up along it. She set the bag on the counter and pulled their things out as Agatha leaned forward, craning her neck to deduce what Rio had brought them.
    </p>
<p>
     "I got us fish!" Rio announced, though any attempt at stifling her laughter was absolutely futile. "From the chip shop. And I got you extra vinegar packets, just how you like."
    </p>
<p>
     "I almost had a heart attack. I really did not think you would put me through that, but for a split second I had to contemplate who, exactly I married." The amusement that Rio found in Agatha's eyes as she spoke felt like it was only mirrored in her own as she gazed upon the woman seated on the other side of that island.
    </p>
<p>
     "And now that split second is over and we're back to being... us." It was meant to be offered as something light-hearted, something close to a joke. What came out was soft, though, and full of love.
    </p>
<p>
     "I like being us," Agatha voiced back decidedly as Rio pulled her food out of the bag. When she held it out, she was deliberate.
    </p>
<p>
     Her right hand was holding the box in a way that lift her wrist exposed, those six little words scribbled there forever in Agatha's handwriting. Agatha took the box without looking, but when Rio didn't let go upon contact, her eyes dropped.
    </p>
<p>
     And then they widened.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's jaw went slack as she just stared at the newly acquired ink Rio had snuck around to get. Those blue eyes began to shine with emotion, with the threat of tears, but Agatha blinked them back. She swallowed down the stunned feeling that had overtaken her and looked up to Rio who was beaming with the excitement of watching her plan fall into place.
    </p>
<p>
     With haste, Agatha discarded the food to the counter, reaching up to pull Rio's hand into both of hers so that she could inspect it, study it. She had even started to touch it, but then stopped herself and instead dropped the contact to the edge of the saniderm where it lined the heel of Rio's palm.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You're a sneaky little asshole,"
     </em>
     Agatha observed in wonder, still tracing the same line over Rio's skin, though she had not torn her eyes away from the sight.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Maybe,"
     </em>
     Rio agreed, shrugging the shoulder that wasn't attached indirectly to the hand Agatha was still holding across the island,
     <em>
      "but now, every time you take this hand, you'll have a reminder of what I will always be for you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     In a rush of movement that Rio had not been expecting, Agatha was on her feet, the sound of her stool scooting back echoing off of every nearby surface. With her hold still on Rio's hand and arm, she pulled her forward. Concurrently, Agatha leaned over that counter to meet her half way in a kiss that shouted and yelled every thing she didn't have the words to say.
    </p>
<p>
     When she pulled away, her eyes shone like the moon on a dark and clear night, the only light Rio ever needed to be able to see, no matter how many shadows would try to creep in.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Well,"
     </em>
     Agatha offered, though she did not right her posture. She was still close, still alight with the excitement and thrill she was feeling at such a gesture.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Now Estee's going to be really pissed."
     </em>

</p>
<p>
     With a lazy afternoon ahead of them, Rio had expected little more than watching a film while stretched out on the couch until the point Agatha would inevitably declare that they were going to take advantage of the stocked refrigerator and make their first meal together as a married couple.
    </p>
<p>
     What she had not been expecting was for the way Agatha's hand would snake down her forearm, at several different points so that she could brush her fingertips, or the pad of her thumb, just around the outer edge of the sealed saniderm on Rio's wrist. After the fifth time it happened during the two hour film, Rio understood it.
    </p>
<p>
     It was doing exactly what she had intended for it to do. It was a very visual, very physical display of what those words meant to Rio, and by extension, it was a very vivid reminder to Agatha that she was the one who had put them into the world. It was the best way Rio could have found to instill such a deep sentiment and she could see that it was having that very effect. Each time, she would do little more than smile to herself, satisfied with such a reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha found comfort in it. That was ultimate reward.
    </p>
<p>
     They had eventually crawled out of their little pit of snuggles and closeness in the couch and set about the task of preparing themselves a meal.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio always loved to watch Agatha cook, but when they cooked together? It was moving poetry and sometimes comical in the same vein. Rio was always trying to add a little more seasoning or spice even when Agatha was very by-the-book when it came to exact measurements. Most times, Rio would simply wait for Agatha to turn around before tossing in an extra dash of whatever she thought the meal needed just for good measure.
    </p>
<p>
     That night, it was the two of them trying to prep for a lamb stew that they were reading off of a recipe card. It wasn't exactly going to plan; Agatha had clearly not timed it appropriately and it would be several more hours before they would actually end up eating. The way Agatha's stomach had growled as they reached such a realization dissolved Rio into a fit of giggles on the spot.
    </p>
<p>
     She spun on her heel and pressed her back to the edge of the counter, easily producing her phone in the same motion. Next to her, palms on the counter and head hanging, Agatha heaved a dejected sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     "We can start it earlier tomorrow, my love. Plus, this pizza place has... pepperoni and blue cheese pizza? Not a combination I've ever considered in my forty years of life, but... When in Iceland?" Rio posed, the sound of her grin ringing so brightly in her tone.
    </p>
<p>
     The way Agatha lifted and turned her head caused her hair to spill over her face, breaking in places to reveal slivers of her skin. Rio could tell through it that she was grinning.
    </p>
<p>
     "You don't like blue cheese," Agatha pointed out, her humor at the idea clear in the tone she chose.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, to be fair... That was an opinion I formed as an eight year old and never budged on. I haven't actually ever tried it since then." Rio paused and took a beat to consider, her lips puckering slightly in the way she chewed on the right inside corner. "I have released holds on a lot of strongly rooted opinions in the last year of my life. Not opposed to seeing if we can add blue cheese to the list."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted there next to her, pushing herself off the counter to a standing position. As she did so, her hands lifted to tame her hair, smoothing it out before she turned around to also lean against the counter. There was no more than a couple of inches of space between their hips and the moment Agatha crossed her arms over her chest, Rio had known she was going to close it.
    </p>
<p>
     And she did.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha would always close the space between them.
    </p>
<p>
     That never had to be a question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well," Agatha hummed, pressing their shoulders together as she dramatically observed the screen of Rio's phone. "Get a medium of that. And then a medium of the pepperoni and mushroom, that way if you hate the blue cheese, you have your back-up. Because personally, I will absolutely devour a pepperoni and blue cheese pizza."
    </p>
<p>
     The immediate laughter as it flittered from between Agatha's lips sent Rio's heart stumbling in her chest. It was so silly, it was just the sound of Agatha laughing. It was something she had heard hundreds, if not thousands, of times before and she knew it would be something she heard a million more, but in that very second, it was the most beautifully pure sound in the world.
    </p>
<p>
     She wanted to get lost in that sound forever.
    </p>
<p>
     She could have, if dinner weren't a little more pressing.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's because you're willing to try anything once," Rio countered, raising her eyebrows in challenge.
    </p>
<p>
     Meeting it instantly, a steep grin curled Agatha's lips as her eyes flickered from Rio's face to the back door. The hot tub didn't have to be in the line of sight for Rio to know exactly what she was referring to without having to say a thing. The moment Agatha's eyes swept back, Rio was wearing a grin of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're trying to tell me you
     <em>
      haven't
     </em>
     tried that
     <em>
      at least once
     </em>
     already?" Rio asked, her jaw dropping the slightest bit in her mock disbelief.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression puckered sourly and then her lips curled downward. "I didn't actually expect you to call me out on it. And it wasn't a hot tub, it was a pool."
    </p>
<p>
     A delighted and deep laugh immediately hit the air as it dove from Rio's lips. "My love, there are very few things within reason in this world that I would be truly shocked to learn you have not partaken in. After all..." Rio paused the same moment she submitted their dinner order. She held that pause as she lowered the phone to the counter and shifted so that she was perpendicular to Agatha, hip pressed to the edge. She leaned a little closer, her lips tauntingly close to Agatha's, so much so that she could have easily closed the distance, but she did not. "If I recall correctly, you let me pin your bare back to a floor-to-ceiling window in your office. Old man with his binoculars and all."
    </p>
<p>
     With a statement like that, Agatha quickly proved that she had no desire to keep space between them. With a quickness, she shifted to the side so that their lips could touch. They didn't collide, didn't bump or fumble. It was just the softest brush but it was immediately followed with the quickest and most teasing swipe of Agatha's tongue across Rio's bottom lip before she pulled away in the next breath.
    </p>
<p>
     There, Rio was left bumbling like an idiot, mouth agape and eyes snapping open at the lack of warmth.
    </p>
<p>
     Across the newly instilled expanse of six or so inches, Agatha was smirking at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know that you said that hoping to get to me, but you look like you might have just played yourself instead," Agatha pointed out, the low rumbles of laughter beginning to roll low in her lungs.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, I did," Rio conceded almost instantly, chest deflating with a soft sigh. "But I also can see that there is another home right over there," she indicated, waving a pointed finger behind her. "And... By my brief mathematical calculations based on the elevation of that home and the height of that fence... If they happen to come outside and we have the back light on..."
    </p>
<p>
     "And?" Agatha prodded, that smirk seeming to only grow the longer Rio verbalized her train of thought.
    </p>
<p>
     "And they could see us! Without binoculars!" Rio pressed, though her voice hiked nearly an entire octave the moment she said it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Annnnnnd?" Agatha pressed harder, smirking even wider.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha!" Rio returned sharply, though the expression she was wearing was torn between being entirely amused and also slightly shocked. "I will absolutely enjoy some relaxing and unwinding time in the hot tub with you, but no funny business! We do not need to get arrested in Iceland for indecent exposure. Our children would never let us hear the end of it," she added, attempting to appear menacing as she tipped her head forward.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lip popped out for just a moment in a pout before it withdrew and she offered a shrug.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's not like they'd be surprised," Agatha offered airily, finding that sense of feigned indifference again. And again, it made Rio laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe not, but that's exactly why we would never hear the end of it." Rio leaned in, pressing her lips to Agatha's cheek, just beneath her eye, before she separated them and set to the task of cleaning up the items they had pulled out for the dinner they were not going to make. "So. Dinner. Hot tub. And then I think we should appropriately break in that big bed for more than just sleeping."
    </p>
<p>
     "You plan a mean itinerary," Agatha tried in a serious tone, but her face was cracking with her smile before she even finished speaking. Rio didn't need to look to know it was there.
    </p>
<p>
     "I mean, if you have any qualms, you can always lodge a complaint. I'm sure we can eliminate a few items..." Rio mused, pulling the vegetables into her arm so that she could carry them all at once to place them back inside the fridge.
    </p>
<p>
     "Absolutely not! It's a short list as is," Agatha shot back, finally moving from her place leaned against the counter to assist Rio is replacing the things they would no longer need. Once everything was returned, Rio grabbed the bottle of white wine in the door and held it up in question. When Agatha nodded, Rio set about getting it uncorked and filling them each a glass.
    </p>
<p>
     Just as they were relocating, the doorbell sounded and their dinner had arrived.
    </p>
<p>
     The way they sat at that too-big table, eating their meal -- where Rio had come to the cemented realization that she still did not favor blue cheese -- and talking about plans for the weeks ahead of them, it had been so absolutely wrought with domesticity. It was a sense of belonging, a sense that while they had been paving their path jointly before, they got to do it solely for them for the time they were in Iceland. Hearing these things that Agatha had planned, it was fulfilling in its own way, in a way that told Rio just how well Agatha knew her and knew the things she would want to experience while they were there.
    </p>
<p>
     The marker on that roadmap that Rio kept coming back to was going to the observation center to see the Borealis later on that week.
    </p>
<p>
     Having spent the majority of her life in the southern hemisphere, the Northern Lights were little more than a myth to Rio, something she had only ever been able to see photos of.  The moment Agatha had booked it, she knew she was helping Rio reach dreams she'd never even knew she had.
    </p>
<p>
     She'd been right in the same way Rio had been right about getting the additional tattoo.
    </p>
<p>
     After dinner, as promised, Rio pulled Agatha by the hand up to the bedroom so that they could change into their swimsuits for an evening dip in the hot tub. It wasn't too late, but the night sky had rolled in a little over an hour before and the chill was sure to ride in right along with it, but Rio didn't care. It was another experience to be had, another way to spend quality time with her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     They had pulled on their long coats and slippers to protect them on the short journey from the back door to the hot tub, and the time it took to get that ridiculous cover off through their giggles. They shed the outerwear and slipped into the jacuzzi, the steam rolling off of the top of the water in waves. The contrast between the heat of the water and the chill of the night air was actually insane for the first few moments Rio tried to understand it. It was the wildest contrast, but it quickly became comfortable. It was nice, even.
    </p>
<p>
     Intentionally, Rio had let Agatha settle into a spot first. That light beside the back door cast on her so perfectly, those shadows and angles making her look just as beautiful as she always was, but in a somehow new way. Once Agatha was comfortable, Rio placed herself on the indented seat across from her. The moment she did so and lifted her attention to the woman across from her, Agatha looked down right dumbstruck.
    </p>
<p>
     "Something the matter, my love?" Rio posed innocently, tilting her head as her arms raised to glide aimlessly through the water around her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Actually, yes," Agatha responded, her brow pinched so, so tightly. "Why are you over there?" Her tone wasn't harsh, or cutting, but she was clearly not pleased with the decision Rio had made.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because," Rio responded, her voice so casual and calm, "I told you no funny business, so I wanted to remove any temptation." She was saying it like she meant it, but she didn't. Would she be completely embarrassed if they happened to fool around outside on an Icelandic night and get busted by the neighbors? Hands down. Was that enough to actually fight Agatha off? Not a chance.
    </p>
<p>
     When she looked back across that space and saw her wife there in that black bikini top that tied behind her neck, which was entirely exposed with the way her hair was pulled up and tied into a massive bun? Rio was actually the one who was fighting temptation.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was just so
     <em>
      beautiful.
     </em>
     Even beyond the intelligence, even beyond the vision and the drive, Agatha was simply so fucking beautiful.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had told her as much as often as she could, but there in the manufactured light on that cold night in a country so far from either of the ones they called home, that beauty was the vision of Rio's life right in front of her very eyes. Every second of every minute of every day she experienced moving forward, it was with
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     beauty in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     "If that's the case..." Agatha offered, turning her eyes out toward the night sky, though it didn't do much to hide the coy smile on her lips. "What do you think the kids are doing right now?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was going to play Rio's little game with that little give and it had Rio clearly delighted. At least, that was the impression she had been under.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, when she turned her own head to follow Agatha's eyeline, the water began to slosh around too quickly for Rio to get why. She did not understand until it splashed up against her chest and she turned her head to see Agatha substantially closer and shifting with ease in a way that allowed her to practically slide right onto Rio's lap, her knees landing on that bench on either side of Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "You couldn't even last three minutes?" Rio asked her through her laughter, though her hands had immediately settled on Agatha's thighs beneath the water.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're telling me you actually thought I would?" Agatha offered back, her lips pulled back in her triumph. "You know me better than that."
    </p>
<p>
     "You're right, I do," Rio returned, tilting her head back enough to look Agatha in the eye, donning a sly a smile of her own. "But I still think it's not the best idea to put on a show for our temporary neighbors," she added, though in utter contradiction, she leaned forward to place a full kiss to Agatha's lips. She let it linger for just a moment too long before she pulled back, settling against the wall of the hot tub as she beheld the woman in her lap.
    </p>
<p>
     "So then," Agatha began, letting one hand rest over the strap of Rio's bikini top on her shoulder while the other began to trace light lines up the side of Rio's neck, and then her jaw as Agatha watched in contemplation, "what I'm hearing is we just have to be
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     inconspicuous."
    </p>
<p>
     With the way Agatha was touching her, those delicious words she was pouring into Rio's ear, Rio was never going to be able to tell her no and mean it. They weren't exhibitionists, and they didn't seek such a thrill on a regular basis, but she could tell that there was something about the opportunity that was really pressing all of the right buttons for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha, you're being rotten. Can't we just enjoy the hot tub?"
     </em>
     Rio questioned lowly. Once more, her physical actions betrayed her as her fingertips sank into Agatha's thighs on either side of her. She was trying to ignore the way Agatha's own fingertip reached the other side of her jaw and hooked, beckoning her forward.
     <em>
      "Agatha, nooo--"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio didn't mean it.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't mean it even more when Agatha kissed her like
     <em>
      that.
     </em>
     It was direct, it was deep, it was passionate and full of measured care. In nothing more than instinct, Rio's hands slid up, higher, until they were settled over that pinch of fabric of Agatha's bikini bottoms there on her hips.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't mean it
     <em>
      the most
     </em>
     the very second Agatha's tongue pressed so gingerly past her lips, as if she were not about to assert her dominance in the very next seconds. Agatha knew all the right ways to kiss Rio and right then, she had her heart set on proving it, apparently. There were times their teeth would catch or where Rio could feel her lip pinch for just a second, but she was never going to raise a complaint.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had only ever dreamed of what it might be like to be kissed like that by another human being.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, she got it every single day of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment they separated to breathe, Rio tried her hand one last time at slowing this down before they began to sail over the edge without a care in the world.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "We should go insiiiiide,"
     </em>
     Rio tried, though she had been aware that it was pointless. Who would she be if she were to turn down her wife, sat in her lap kissing her like that? Even more, who would she be if she did not let Agatha take her in that damn hot tub? It had always been one of those casual fantasies, something that had been a passive curiosity more than it had ever been an active want, but it was right there,
     <em>
      literally in her lap. Literally.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     As Agatha shifted to lean forward so that she could press her lips to Rio's ear, her hips rocked forward both in Rio's hold and against Rio's own hips in a way that drew a shuddering breath, one that pulled the sharply cold air into every inch of her lungs.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "We could. Or we could fuck right here and be real sneaky about it,"
     </em>
     Agatha suggested in the lowest, sweetest, most daring challenge Rio was sure she had ever heard come from her lips. Before Rio could even wrap her head around that enough to try and form a response, Agatha was working her hips down again. So very calculating, she also sank her teeth into the lobe of Rio's ear.
    </p>
<p>
     Reflexively, Rio's grip on Agatha's hips tightened and her own hips shifted on the seat below her. She could have found words, could have somehow given an answer that she was sure Agatha would have loved to hear, but she didn't feel like talking anymore. Agatha knew she was going to win before this had even started.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio just had to put up the appearance of a fight for the thrill of the chase, they both knew that much.
    </p>
<p>
     And, as she did every single time, Rio's will to resist snapped right in half.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned her head, delighted with the way Agatha's hair was pulled up because of what was displayed right in front of her. The kisses she pressed were firm, hungry. They were needy in the way that she had the upper hand, here. Agatha wanted this, but it was Rio's for the taking.
    </p>
<p>
     Those kisses grew a little more desperate, sucking softly at skin that Rio knew had two weeks to heal. The sudden attack on her neck had caused Agatha's head to drop from where her lips had been so close to Rio's ear, though Rio could still feel her hot breath as it hit the skin of her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     Turning her head just a bit more, Rio's lips found that spot on Agatha's neck, the exact spot she loved so much. It was that very spot that could make Agatha come unglued every single time. Right then, that had never been more true.
    </p>
<p>
     The very second Rio latched to that spot and sucked on Agatha's skin, Agatha's hips reactively sank down and bucked back and forth in her search for friction. The softest whimper spilled out of her, not anywhere near loud enough to leave the space around them.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Rio,"
     </em>
     came Agatha's craggy whisper just inches from Rio's ear, her hips still restless in her sudden neediness.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips sucked a little harder just just a moment longer before she unlatched and pulled back, tipping her head so that she could look up at Agatha, lips twisting up in satisfaction at the look of absolute desperation there. Before Agatha even had to ask, Rio's right hand removed its hold on Agatha's hip and dropped inward.
    </p>
<p>
     With the way Agatha's weight was bearing down, a bit of force was required as Rio wedged her hand between their bodies, using that leverage to press up against Agatha's core. Another sound poured from her, but this time a bit louder in the form of a moan. In an attempt to keep her quiet, Rio leaned up enough to catch her lips, swallowing the immediate whimper the action drew.
    </p>
<p>
     Sensing what Rio was trying to accomplish, Agatha released some of the pressure in a way that allowed her bottoms to be pushed aside by a suddenly impatient Rio. Between the way they were kissing and just how desperate Rio's touch had grown, it had to be completely apparent to Agatha that her games were working. What was more prevalent than that, though, was that Rio would always bend the knee when it came to pleasing her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     Her tongue was precise in the way it scoped the inside of Agatha's mouth, careful in the way it surveyed her teeth and her palate. It was meant to be a distraction from the anticipation Agatha was surely feeling that paid off the moment a couple of Rio's fingers pressed between the folds of Agatha's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     It was different in that there wasn't an immediate ability to gauge her arousal, but Rio quickly realized that Agatha's excitement was far thicker than the water they were submerged in. The moment that contact was made, she felt it in her teeth as Agatha moaned softly, hips twitching slightly to meet the contact.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was all too aware of where Agatha's hands had landed -- one still on her shoulder and the other in her hair to hold her close as they kissed -- as the pressure they both applied seemed to intensify. The moment Rio broke the kiss, Agatha had started to form a sound of disapproval, but Rio was too quick in the way she nipped at Agatha's upper lip to let it happen. Instead, what sounded was another quiet moan, but mid-way, it rose the slightest bit in volume as she felt Rio's fingers press into her hot core.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Gods, Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio breathed in sheer wonder, finding the right angle to comfortably begin a rhythm. When she was satisfied with both her own movement and the way Agatha began to work her hips, riding the contact, she found the focus to initiate another wild and wanting kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe they were insane, maybe they could have been called sex-crazed, but that right there was something Rio knew she could never get enough of. She would never be satiated enough to not want Agatha's fingers in her hair, Agatha's mouth on hers hot and wet, Agatha's hips working their steady up and down motion as she tried to fill herself with Rio's touch as much as she possibly could.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     want Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would want Agatha pliant and whipped in a hot tub, she would want Agatha in the dawn-laden hours as the sun kissed the morning sky. There would never be a time when Rio would not want Agatha in the shower, or in the office when one of them was 'working too hard.' There simply was no part of Agatha in existence that Rio could ever not want.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand shifted slightly, allowing for the movement of her thumb as it slid up Agatha's center, slick and viscous in the warmth of the bubbling water around them. With intent, it found the firm nub of Agatha's clit, gracing it with purpose each time she worked her fingers into Agatha's body, pressing as deeply as she could manage with each pass.
    </p>
<p>
     Although she had been fairing well enough, Rio found herself to keep her attention divided evenly between kissing Agatha and fucking her proper. Slowly, Rio dialed back on the kiss but only so that it didn't come as such a shock when she pulled her lips away. There was little room for Agatha to raise any complaints with the way she was quick to press her mouth to that familiar spot below Agatha's ear, though this time she bared teeth, skimming them over exposed skin.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oohh, Riooo,"
     </em>
     Agatha whined, her hips beginning to work a little harder, a little faster. Her breathing was growing more shallow, that need beginning to reverberate through her and Rio was feeling it everywhere at once as Agatha grew closer and closer to reaching that climax she so desperately craved.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio curled her fingers in tandem with Agatha's rolling of her hips and she was certain that would be the thing to seal the deal. However, when Agatha spoke, it wasn't to moan her name again.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oh-oh! The neighbors!"
     </em>
     she gasped, but the motions of her hips did not desist in the least. In fact, when Rio attempted to turn her head to look, Agatha dropped them with force and rolled forward. At the same time, her grip on Rio's shoulder tightened and her fingertips were pressing so hard that Rio considered for a moment that Agatha might just pop right through her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no one out there.
    </p>
<p>
     Even with Rio's fingers deep inside of her, giving her everything she wanted, she had to be a pain on the ass. Of course she would get off on that. Rio wouldn't know who she was if she didn't, in all honesty.
    </p>
<p>
     Using her positioning there with her hand between their bodies, Rio wrenched her hand upward, her thumb applying a firm pressure to Agatha's clit. In doing so, she finally helped guide Agatha right into that freefall and she felt it in too many places at once. Agatha's thighs began to tremble and her breath caught unevenly in her chest. Most notably, her chest surged forward and her head dropped, finding a familiar home on Rio's shoulder as she stifled the bellowing of a moan she wanted to expel, releasing it in a low rumble instead.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did not move other than to turn her head, peppering kisses to whatever parts of Agatha's face and hair she could reach. She just felt it as Agatha's body trembled and contracted around her touch, fluttering so thoroughly in her pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You are such an asshole,"
     </em>
     Rio growled softly into her hair. Slowly, she started to move her hand but before she could get far, Agatha's hips rolled down again, trapping her there for just a moment longer. After another sighed groan, Agatha released the pressure and allowed Rio the return of her hand.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Maybe. But I got you to fuck me in the hot tub,"
     </em>
     Agatha returned breathlessly, settling atop Rio's thighs as she lifted her head so that Rio could look into those beautiful, breathtaking, stunning blue eyes she loved so impossibly much.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You did, even if you nearly gave me a heart attack in the process."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha breathed a giggle, those lips curling up into an insanely satisfied grin.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Feeling you tense like that made me come even harder,"
     </em>
     Agatha murmured at her, leaning forward to steal a brief but gratuitous kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You, wife of mine, are insane and insatiable. Whatever will I do with you?"
     </em>
     Rio cooed at her, taking the quickest kiss of her own.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You will...."
     </em>
     Agatha began, her eyes dropping to the sight of her fingertips as they untangled from Rio's hair and began to brush light lines down her neck.
     <em>
      "...let me so kindly return the favor."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's head tipped back at the sensation of Agatha's touch on her neck, eyes sliding shut and lips parting to release a worked-up sigh. For as much as she thought she might have been able to keep up some facade of a steel resolve before what had just unfolded, there was little chance Rio would have been able to keep Agatha's hands off of her body right then.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You sound so confident,"
     </em>
     Rio returned in an attempt to goad Agatha, if not with words then with the sultry sound of her voice.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I do because I am,
     </em>
     " Agatha whispered, that touch increasing with the way Agatha dropped her remaining fingers, all four brushing their way across Rio's sternum. The feather light contact somehow made goosebumps flare on the majority of Rio's skin that was not submerged beneath the water.
     <em>
      "You're fully capable of telling me no..."
     </em>
     The observation was made at the exact same moment that Agatha's fingers curled into one side of Rio's top, giving a gentle tug. When Rio felt the cold air as it made contact with her breast, she sucked in a breath that she did not immediately release.
     <em>
      "...but you like it too much and won't. Even if I told you there were 20 people standing on that deck up there. With binoculars."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio shifted beneath her wife in desire, her hips nudging against one of Agatha's thighs, then the other in their position on either side of Rio. When Agatha's fingers gripped and pinched that exposed nipple, they lifted in want. She wanted to be touched by Agatha, and Agatha was right. Rio did not give a shit who was watching. To affirm this verbally, she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Fuck it, let 'em watch."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The thrill and satisfaction that washed over Agatha upon hearing such a deliverance was like a surge of electrical current through her entire body the moment Rio saw it. Before she could respond in any way, Agatha was moving. She was picking herself up off Rio's lap and then...
    </p>
<p>
     Then she was moving back to the other side of the hot tub?!
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha!"
     </em>
     Rio spat venomously, the confusion and sudden irritation plainly written on her face.
     <em>
      "What are you doing?!"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha placed herself in the same spot she had initially been in, facing Rio with a wolfish sneer that curled up both corners of her mouth. Her hands lifted out of the water and pointed down, indicating her lap.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched her, a little out of breath and a little disgruntled, but that annoyance ebbed away as she recognized Agatha's playfulness more than her mischief.  After exhaling a huff of a sigh, Rio pushed off of the bench and kept herself submerged as she floated across the space. She had started to make the same effort Agatha had in that she was going to slide right into her lap, but Agatha stopped her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's brow knit in confusion and as her lips parted in protest, Agatha's hands found her sides at the same time she scooted back on the bench. Once situated, she used her hold to gently push and pull on either side of Rio's body to suggest she wanted her to turn around. Catching this, Rio obliged and spun in place, knowing before it happened that Agatha was going to pull her into her lap.
    </p>
<p>
     Carefully, she landed there, met in the same second with the feel of her wife's lips on the skin of her shoulder blade.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You are positively rotten,"
     </em>
     Rio pressed in a gravelly tone, one that caught a bit over the last syllable as Agatha's hands began to roam Rio's midsection beneath the water.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Am I?"
     </em>
     Agatha posed back innocently. Her lips found the side of Rio's neck and her fingertips traced the same line up and down the direct center of Rio's abdomen. As Agatha's breath graced Rio's ear, Rio could feel the pressure building in her middle, elevating to her chest.
     <em>
      "Or are you just saying that because you knew this was inevitable?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Can it be both?"
     </em>
     Rio whimpered. Before she could draw in a full breath, she gasped softly at the feeling of Agatha's teeth sinking into the flesh of her neck. Incidentally, her fingertips slipped below the waist of Rio's bottoms at the same time, drawing a slight wriggle of her hips in response.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's touch sank lower, but the moment Rio felt the way her fingers diverged to the sides, to the outsides of her lips, her hips shifted again. This time, there was a little more demand in the gesture.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agathaaaaa."
     </em>
     It may have been drawn out, but there was a urgency in the lone word as Rio grew restless to feel Agatha's touch on her body. She was desperate, begging at that point.
     <em>
      "Please, touch me."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Thatta girl,"
     </em>
     came Agatha's praise, deep and hot in Rio's ear. In reward, Agatha drew her hand up so that her fingers could join once more, the two in the middle sinking back down, straight into the slick of Rio's arousal. In a ripple of shock, Rio's muscles contracted for the briefest second before the pleasure sank in, seeping through to her bones.
    </p>
<p>
     The hand that was not nestled between Rio's legs trekked over her torso to latch onto her exposed breast, kneading it in tandem with the way her fingers were simply gliding back and forth, intentionally making the lightest contact with Rio's clit.
    </p>
<p>
     Not moving was not an option, especially with Rio's need for more. She was parched, now, and needed her thirst for release to be quenched. Words were escaping her, only finding the soundwaves as light grunts and soft whimpers that did not display what she wanted nearly as bad as she wanted them to. Then, there was a word. It was one word, but it was good enough.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Inside,"
     </em>
     Rio rasped, raising her hips again.
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel Agatha's chuckle on her skin before she heard it, but her words produced a bigger groan than the feeling of her fingers sinking inside of Rio's body did.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Look at those ten people smoking cigars and drinking gin,"
     </em>
     she badgered sarcastically, though the allure was thick over her words.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes flew open to the sight of the empty deck in the distance, and a half-grumble, half-moan rattled out of her. Surprisingly, Rio actually found herself more disappointed that there was actually no one there. For as much as she had insisted that it wasn't a great idea, there was something that turned Rio on even more about the idea that a group of people could have been stood there watching as her wife fucked her on full display in that stupid hot tub.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Fuck, Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio managed between breaths, her hips working in conjunction with the rhythm Agatha had found. Her chest started its acceleration in pace as it heaved with her effort, but she wasn't quite there. She knew what would get her there, but she could sense that Agatha was having her fun in drawing this out.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let it carry on as such for a few minutes, working those hips in ways that would allow Agatha to reach further, to feel those parts of Rio's body she knew how to work so well. As Rio discovered the wherewithal to request progression, Agatha already sensed it and obliged, pressing a third finger into Rio's tight core.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Gods, Rio, you feel so good,"
     </em>
     Agatha murmured in her haze, her own breath hitting Rio's skin unevenly.
    </p>
<p>
     What Agatha immediately saw that Rio -- with her eyes closed -- did not was the front door on that distant home as it pulled open and a woman stepped out. She let it close behind her and raised her hands, apparently lighting a cigarette before they dropped again and she tended to her nicotine fix.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You close?"
     </em>
     Agatha purred at her knowingly, but Rio's eyes were still shut as she whimpered a response and gave a nod of her head. As if to spur her on, Agatha gave a rough pinch to the nipple that had been beneath her palm.
     <em>
      "Good. Don't open your eyes. Come for me, baby."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     For the briefest moment, Rio's pleasured brain didn't understand that chain of words. It was the last sentence that drew her attention first, though, and that was something she could do. It was something she had been dangerously close to doing anyway. With the way Agatha curled her fingers and pressed up, pulling toward the front of Rio's body, it had been easy enough to manage.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head tilted back, bumping into Agatha's behind her. Concurrently, Agatha's hand released from Rio's breast and flew up in hurried caution. Her fingers pressed firmly over Rio's lips to staunch the sound of the moan that had begun to roll out of her. Rio's own hand had launched back, gripping tightly at Agatha's bun.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "We have an audience, really this time,"
     </em>
     Agatha whispered in her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     In a moment of insanity, it only made Rio come harder. Her body shook and trembled in Agatha's lap, her moans hitting the air as nothing more than stifled whimpers and whines.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha held her position, fingers curled inside Rio's body, while Rio rode out every last wave of the orgasm that was completely tearing her apart. As the calm came, Agatha pulled her hand back but it stationed just above Rio's pubic bone. Her warm breath hit Rio's neck this time as she breathed the haughtiest chuckle there, also removing the pressure over Rio's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio's eyes finally slid open, they landed directly on the woman that was leaned over the deck railing of the other house. She wasn't looking at them, but something flared in Rio anyway, something dangerous that she could pay no mind to if she did not want to get herself in trouble.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You are... an asshole,"
     </em>
     Rio informed her wife as she collapsed back against her, allowed for Agatha's chin to hook over her shoulder. Rio didn't need to look at her to see that absolutely devious grin on her lips as she wrapped one arm around Rio's middle and used her now free hand to replace the bikini top to its intended position.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "But you love me."
     </em>
     The confidence there could have been grating if Rio were anyone else. It was exactly what Rio
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to hear. She
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     Agatha to know without question that Rio loved her and could state so with full faith, just as she had right then.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I do,
     </em>
     " Rio responded, her voice husky and low.
     <em>
      "We should go inside so I can show you some more."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     That was all it took.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha placed one last kiss to Rio's shoulder before shooing her up, encouraging movement so they could relocate. The cold was an entirely new experience as they tried to be quick in getting out of the hot tub, replacing the cover, and running back inside, but Rio was still shivering from head to toe as Agatha slid the glass door shut behind them and flipped off the outside light.
    </p>
<p>
     It took all of two seconds for Agatha to strip Rio of her coat, stealing a kiss as she did so before discarding her own. In their journey through the house to the bedroom, they seemed to have little regard for the water they were leaving behind in their wakes. Well, for the most part, until Rio slipped at the top of the stairs, saved only by the way Agatha was quick to catch her and keep her from incurring any injury.
    </p>
<p>
     The pair of them were nothing but a flurry of motion, of touches, of giggles, and the soft smacking of lips. Hands canvassed skin and tangled in hair, lips sucked and kissed, wet swimwear squelched as it was discarded to the floor with little care. They were the most beautiful brand of chaos, one so completely woven with love throughout.
    </p>
<p>
     For hours, they were nothing more than a tangle of limbs that produced little sounds other than moans and sighs and gasps. There were frenzied moments, ones that were wild and untamed. There were other moments, slower ones, where it was obvious that the intention was driven by love, by feeling. Rio had honestly lost count of the amount of times she'd come at Agatha's mercy, nor could she recount the exact number of orgasms she had deliciously pulled from Agatha's body.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time she collapsed on top of her wife, their skin sticky with sweat and remnants of chlorine, numbers didn't matter. The only thing that mattered was right there below her, hair a mess and having halfway fallen out of her bun. The only thing of importance was laying there, her chest heaving beneath Rio's head, with Rio's ear pressed to the very spot she could hear the wildly beating heart of the woman she loved, that same heart that loved
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     so wholly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had let her lay like that for a little while, even bringing her arms up to wrap around Rio in a firm embrace as she placed several wayward kisses atop her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had listened to that sound beneath her ear as it gradually slowed to a normal pace. It had gotten the slightest bit softer, even, and Rio had started to wonder if Agatha had fallen asleep. Before she could manage the gumption to lift her head, she felt Agatha shift in the embrace she had around Rio, moving to trace a couple of fingers up the center of her back.
    </p>
<p>
     Even though Rio didn't move, she could tell that Agatha was trying to say something. She could hear it in the tiniest catches of breath, in the way she would take a deep one only for it to get hung up on the way out, unable to vibrate the way it needed to so that words could form.
    </p>
<p>
     It went on like that for a couple of minutes before Rio made the decision to say something first.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's okay to say it, whatever it is,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured gently, though she did not move from her slumped and depleted position on top of Agatha. The erratic motion of Agatha's tracing on her back stilled and another breath caught on the way in. When she exhaled it through her nose, Rio could feel it on the top of her head.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm ready to talk about it."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Ah, yes. Their uninvited wedding guest.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand raised from where it had lazily landed on Agatha's bicep and moved to trace the smallest shapes on Agatha's chest, right in front of her face as she watched her own movements.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm listening."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It wasn't a press for more, wasn't a demand that it all be spilled at once. No, Rio was letting Agatha know that this was something that could happen at her pace. This was something she got to work through while knowing that Rio's patience was not going to wane or waver.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's touch began moving on Rio's back again as she took the time to appropriately frame her thoughts. After just a couple more moments, her soft voice sounded and if Rio didn't know better, she almost would have said that Agatha sounded
     <em>
      nervous.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "No one ever told me that he recovered, let alone that he was walking around Los Angeles. I... I don't even know who told him about the wedding because it was absolutely not Nicky."
     </em>
     Agatha took a breath, exhaling it a bit forcefully through her nose. Rio didn't need to see it to know that Agatha's lips were pressing and twisting with the storm of her thoughts as it wreaked havoc on her state of mind.
     <em>
      "I know that because I watched him... He saw Colton, marched right up to him and... He let him have it. I stepped in when he dropped a 'I don't want to cause a scene out of respect for my parents, but...' because we did not need that on our plates."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was very aware that while she was trying to condense things a bit, Agatha had shared that piece of information with her intentionally. She had chosen to quote Nicky like that on purpose, because Rio needed to know how Nicky spoke about her when she was not around.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Colton said something about me not telling Nicky about what was going on, but that was all I let him say. I... I told him that I didn't want to hear his reasoning, or anything he had to say. I told him that it wasn't right or reasonable to walk away from his child for a decade to turn up on that day of all days. It didn't matter why he was there, just that he shouldn't have been."
     </em>
     Agatha stopped herself again, taking another slow and measured breath.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still there, steadfast against Agatha's chest, listening for the shifts in her heartbeat the longer she spoke. Her fingers had not stopped their work, skating so softly over Agatha's skin.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I said what I needed to, capping it off with all of the reasons you will always be a superior parent to Nicholas. When I was done, I gave him the opportunity to leave on his own... And maybe threatened that if he didn't, I was going to enlist Hēmi's help in escorting him out,"
     </em>
     Agatha disclosed, breathing a soft laugh into the quiet air around them.
     <em>
      "Needless to say, he left. And... Just like that, it was like it hadn't happened at all. It had no consequence other than upsetting Nicky and myself, but we recovered pretty quickly."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was quiet, ponderous for a long few moments as she let the information settle. She knew that Agatha had been upset with herself about not saying anything, but Rio didn't really feel like she had to be. She was glad, of course, that Agatha had finally decided to talk about it when it had clearly been weighing on her. At the bottom of it all, an issue had popped up and Agatha, as she always did, had handled it with aplomb.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You really should stop being so hard on yourself,"
     </em>
     Rio informed her, finally picking her head up from Agatha's chest so she could peer down at her, the tiniest smile tugging on the corners of her lips.
     <em>
      "You were so upset that you didn't tell me... And I'm glad you did, but... You encountered an unavoidable issue. It angered you and upset you, but you did exactly what you needed to do. You communicated your stance and provided options for progression. It just happened to work out that any progression in that regard was going to be him leaving."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Scooting up the slightest bit, Rio dropped her head so that she could press her lips to Agatha's in a kiss that screamed her understanding and adoration at the loudest volumes. She let it linger a beat too long before she pulled away, blinking those green eyes open into Agatha's bright blues.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You did the right thing, my love. Be gentler with yourself."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     When Agatha responded, it had been with a sentiment that Rio had not quite been expecting.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm getting there. But... Until then, I know you'll be gentle enough with me for the both of us."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's smile was serene but genuine.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Always, Agatha. You can count on that."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     With a few more soft and sweet kisses, Rio had slipped off to Agatha's side so that she could curl up there, in her nightly station pressed to Agatha's skin. It was her favorite way to ease into sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio stirred the next day, it was only as Agatha slipped out from under her to climb out of bed. She had released a series of whines and grumbles, ones that tried to amount to asking Agatha to come back, but they never quite made it there. Agatha seemed to understand anyway. She leaned over the bed and kissed Rio's cheek, brushing her hair back.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Get some more sleep, my love. I'm just running to the store."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     That had been enough for Rio. She was honestly too tired to question it, right then, and so she groaned her approval and turned back over to fall asleep again.
    </p>
<p>
     She was not sure how much longer it had been by the time she awoke to the feeling of the bed shifting, causing her to roll forward slightly before she gripped at more of that line of consciousness.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha?"
     </em>
     Rio asked, reaching up to rub at her eye.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Sleepy, huh?"
     </em>
     Agatha teased softly as she settled back into the pillows, clad in a t-shirt and her underwear, already having shed her pants.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mmhm, what time is it?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted again, but only in a way that allowed her to pull Rio into her arms and place against her chest.
     <em>
      "It's a little after three. But you needed the rest. We still have plenty of time left in the day."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's head tilted up so that she could behold her wife, but from the way she was situated, something else caught her attention. Her brow knit deeply as her eyes fell to that spot behind Agatha's ear -- Rio's spot that she loved to pay extra attention to -- and the different texture there.
    </p>
<p>
     As if she had been throttled into a new state of being awake and alert, Rio scrambled to sit up a little more. Her hand raised and hooked under Agatha's jaw, gripping it so that she could use her hold to turn Agatha's head how she wanted it, offering her a better view of that patch of skin.
    </p>
<p>
     There, just behind Agatha's ear, was a small tattoo of a terribly drawn boat.
    </p>
<p>
     That was Rio's boat.
    </p>
<p>
     The one she had drawn on the note she'd left with the security guard at Agatha's office.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had gotten that shitty boat inked onto her body for all of time.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha..."
     </em>
     Rio breathed, the mystified tone of her voice winning out over any other emotion she could have selected right then.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel as Agatha fought to turn her head and Rio let her, loosening her grip.
    </p>
<p>
     Those gorgeous blue eyes were crackling with sparks of mischief and the grin Agatha was wearing nearly plucked the breath right out of Rio's lungs.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You didn't think I'd let you one-up me, did you?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Of course not.
    </p>
<p>
     They were equals.
    </p>
<p>
     Their playing field would always be even.
    </p>
<p>
     That was who they were, the Harkness-Vidals forever in their indentity.

     *****
    </p>
<p>
     "I cannot believe you, you little sneak!"
    </p>
<p>
     Such a statement garnered only a pointed stare from Agatha, her eyes narrowing teasingly as her head tipped to the side in a playfully accusatory manner.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio Daniela, don't even. Where do you think I got the idea, Mrs. 'It takes 2 hours to get fish and chips?'" Agatha was beaming before she finished speaking. She realized it was ridiculous, realized that they were insane in their desire to prove to each other and the world just how deep their devotion truly was.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, so you're just...
     <em>
      unoriginal?
     </em>
     " Rio returned, her own lips splitting wide to reveal her bright and toothy grin.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's jaw went slack, eyes widening in her feigned shock. Her hand raised, fingertips grazing the material of her shirt to further accentuate how insulting such a comment was.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of all the things you've ever said to me, that one's like a shot to the heart, my love," Agatha pressed emphatically, additionally exemplifying the point by actually pressing her hand to her chest above her heart.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know..." Rio watched her, eyes sweeping over Agatha's face, down to her dramatic gesture and back up again. "I think you
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     missed your calling as an actress."
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio!" Agatha squealed, lifting the hand off of her chest only to reach over, palming the entirety of Rio's face in a way that blocked her vision and squished her nose down, leaving her to burst into laugher. "What the hell has gotten into you today?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached up with both hands to remove Agatha's from her face, but trying to taper her giggles at the same time was proving fruitless. She leaned forward, body still shaking with her delight and pressed a haphazard kiss to Agatha's lips.
    </p>
<p>
     These were the moments that felt a little more special, the ones where they got to be insane and silly in the little holes they could find that isolated them from the world.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the room at the Freehand. It was the houseboat. It was that house that looked so much like home, but in Iceland.
    </p>
<p>
     Those places were little pockets of the universe that they could tuck into, that they could hide in and revel in everything that they were together. What they had, Rio knew, could be defined as little more than absolute magic.
    </p>
<p>
     Life would be hard, but there was something so deeply seated within Rio that knew they would get through it. They had to because what they had? It couldn't be replicated.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had spent over half of her life terrified of the idea that she could ever love or be loved.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, Rio was going to spend the rest of it reveling in both of those things. She was going to wake up every morning, excited to greet another day with the woman she loved. She knew they would face challenges, that they would have to spend time apart eventually, but it would be manageable because wherever life took them, they would always find their way back to one another.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio understood that while the last several months had been suitable for constant presence -- aside from Agatha's trip to LA to handle her legal matters -- it wasn't always going to be like that. Agatha would surely have to travel for work and Rio was about to have to start considering the same thing. Now that the drone project was complete, there were meetings she would have to attend, people who were going to submit offers to purchase the technology so that they could mass produce and distribute.
    </p>
<p>
     Of course mass production had always been the plan, but there were other things to consider, too. Rio had begun such a project because of her environmental awareness. The bees were dying and she wanted a solution. It had taken her years of her life, but she had gotten there. The hard part had arrived, where she had to discern motives and contemplate the idea that such a technology could fall into the wrong hands.
    </p>
<p>
     Any governmental offers, from
     <em>
      any
     </em>
     country were absolutely off the table. Those drones were constructed to perpetuate the growth and progression of nature and in turn, the world. The idea had already crept into Rio's mind that they could be weaponized, that they could be misused, and as a result, it had made her begin to question herself. With such doubt, she knew that once those meetings started, it was going to be especially hard to be apart from Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     They could hide away in their little bubbles, but only for so long.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, Rio was going to enjoy it for what it was until reality came calling once more.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio pulled away, her eyes fluttering open to behold her wife, something dawned on her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Wait a minute..." she muttered, reaching up so she could turn Agatha's head again to stare at that tattoo again, this time with a drop of contempt. "You did that on purpose! That's my favorite spot! And now I can't kiss it for WEEKS?!"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's laughter had started somewhere in the middle of Rio's realization, her cheeks pink and pinched with how high they were pushed up as a result of the smile that came with her audible delight.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did do it on purpose, but not for
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     reason. I did it because every time you kiss me there, it's an imprint of your lips on the very thing that brought us together. The houseboat. Our houseboat."
    </p>
<p>
     The longer Rio listened to Agatha, having let her face go so they could lock gazes again, the more she softened. She knew that she'd had her own reasons for putting the tattoo of Agatha's handwriting where she had, but she hadn't really stopped to consider what Agatha's reasons might be for her own placement.
    </p>
<p>
     That explanation?
    </p>
<p>
     It moved Rio to tears.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nooo, no no!" came Agatha's immediate soothing as she noticed the glassiness in Rio's eyes before a lone tear dropped down her cheek, careening over the smooth skin to take a leap off of the corner of her jaw. Agatha's reaction was quick as she reached up, her thumb brushing over the trail of moisture that had been left in a straight line down Rio's face. "Don't cry, baby. It's supposed to make you smile!"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's face turned into the feeling of Agatha's touch, her eyes sliding shut for just a moment while she debated what it was she wanted to say. Slowly, they opened again and she drew in a slow, deep breath.
    </p>
<p>
     "It does, and will... I just..." Rio felt like she had never read a word in her life, like she didn't have a basic grasp on a language she had spoken her entire existence. Wasn't life with Agatha like that sometimes? It was, especially when she did these harebrained things with insane but well-intentioned motivations. "I will never understand what I did in this life to get to have you, to have the incredible opportunity to be your wife. I will never be able to grasp what right move I ever could have made to have the honor of being loved by you. That's... That's all."
    </p>
<p>
     From her spot propped against the pillows, Agatha scooted a little closer, pulling Rio into her arms so that she could hold her against her chest. Like second nature, Rio's head dropped to that spot in the center of her sternum, the sound of her heart beating like a soothing drumline beneath Rio's ear.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can tell you, if you'd like," Agatha murmured, her fingers beginning their ritual of gently combing their way through Rio's hair. Rio did not verbalize an answer and for a long moment, she did not move either. At the exact same time she went to nod her head, Agatha had already started to speak. "The very first thing you did was that you saw a stranger in trouble and tried to warn her. The next one was offering that stranger comfort and assistance despite her stupidity and carelessness."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's motions did not stop, even as she ducked her head to place a kiss to Rio's hair. "After that, you gave her wine to nurse the sting of idiocy and cooked for her. You offered her warmth and care without ever knowing her name. You were so gentle that when she woke up on your couch the next morning,
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     was the one who felt undeserving. It was why she panicked and ran away."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was quiet, letting Agatha list all of the reasons that Rio had easily written off as nothing more than the nature of who she was as a person. Maybe that could be true, but maybe what Agatha was saying could also be true at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     "Then you... Then, you took a risk. A very big and I'm sure also a very terrifying risk. You booked a plane ticket and a hotel in a country you had never been to before with nothing but an address in your pocket. With all of that, you stood in the lobby of her office for almost forty-five minutes trying to barter with the security guard to let you up to see her. And yes, I have watched the footage... A couple of times."
    </p>
<p>
     This revelation drew the softest giggle from Rio, whispered over the soft cotton of Agatha's shirt.
    </p>
<p>
     "You did this thing right as you realized that no matter what you said, he wasn't going to budge. You picked up the pen for the visitors sheet and you flipped it around your fingers, like a roll almost. It was a nervous habit, I have since realized, because you do it a lot when you work. But it was... so cute. So then... you left, dejected, that you could not see her. And then, there you were at the top of those steps, an absolute vision. And when she walked up to see you, so poised but directionless, she immediately fell into the love she had told herself was just a figment of her imagination."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel Agatha's breath on the top of her head, so close as she recounted that last bit.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's me. I'm her,"
     </em>
     she added, the softest chuckle escaping her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's smile squashed her cheek there against Agatha's chest, but this time the tears didn't come. It wasn't that she wasn't moved, because she was, but she knew Agatha was right.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     done all of those things. It had made no sense at the time, and she knew she wouldn't have if it hadn't been for the push from Estee, but she had still done them. Rio still made those choices, did all of those things for a stranger because she knew in the core of who she was as a human that she needed to. Maybe it had been far beyond her comprehension at the time, but as she laid there listening to the beating heart of the woman she could not love any more if she tried, she knew that everything she had done had been the right thing to do.
    </p>
<p>
     She got to call Agatha hers because of each and every one of those things.
    </p>
<p>
     "So..." Agatha began, lifting her head and snuggling back into the pillows. "Sædís and I got to talking while she was stabbing me in the neck..." Even before Rio picked her head up off of Agatha's chest to look at her, she could hear the brightness of her grin. It was even more beautiful when Rio adjusted so that she could take in such a sight.
    </p>
<p>
     "She mentioned there's a really nice bar called... And
     <em>
      please
     </em>
     do not kill me because I know I'm absolutely going to fuck this up...
     <em>
      Monkey's Kokteilbarinn --"
     </em>
     Before she could finish, Rio's face had already cracked and her laughter spilled out of her not at the pronunciation, but rather the amount of effort Agatha put into genuinely trying to not fuck it up. "...You know what, I said 'don't kill me' not 'don't laugh.' Left myself open for that one. Anyway! She asked if we would like to join her and her girlfriend for drinks tonight."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes widened slightly in surprise. With some thought, it made some sense. They'd been in together and the interaction had been pleasant, but surely in her one-on-ones with each of them, she had learned different things about them, and about the way the other saw them. In those instances, Sædís had very obviously felt a kinship that she wanted to explore a little more.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha..." Rio trailed, as if her disbelief was too strong to let her process. Before she could speak again, her smile reached her eyes. "Are we making
     <em>
      friends?!
     </em>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     With a playful roll of her own eyes, Agatha's joy sprung to life in her features.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think we just might be, my love."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched her for just a moment before learning forward, taking a light kiss. As she placed herself back where she was safely under Agatha's hold and head on her shoulder, that curling of her lips could not seem to stop.
    </p>
<p>
     "Our first friends together. I mean... That we don't already know individually. It feels... momentous." There was an appreciation in such a statement. There was a value to it in the way that it was a new experience, something they were doing together for the first time. As wives, they were moving about the world in a way that garnered them companionship in a platonic sense, outside of their own romantic bond.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because it is," Agatha returned softly, this time the one to take a gentle kiss. She kept it light and brief, but Rio could still see the softest dusting of pink across her cheeks when she broke it to lean back into the pillows again.
    </p>
<p>
     "She said she closes up at 7 tonight and then would need to go home to change. We exchanged numbers and I told her I would text her with a definitive answer once I talked to you about it." The arm that Agatha had wrapped around Rio's frame was strong, but the way her fingertips traced over Rio's arm -- half over her sleeve and half over her skin in an up and down motion -- was so very soft. "So... What do you think?"
    </p>
<p>
     "I think I would quite like to go have drinks with some new friends," Rio stated decidedly, the excitement slowly seeping into her tone with each word.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, that gives us about five hours to do... Whatever we want with!" Agatha was stating it as an option invitation, and Rio knew she could have made absolutely any suggestion and Agatha would have been open to it. Right then, Rio's beguiling was much softer than the wilder ideas she could have entertained.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can we just stay like this for a little while?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's answer came easily.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, my love."
    </p>
<p>
     And so, they had. Rio had been too comfortable there nestled against Agatha's side to want to go anywhere else. They had talked about their tattoos, the fact that they should eat something before they met with Sædís and her girlfriend, about how Iceland was already providing quite an experience and they hadn't done all that much up to that point. They also discussed breaking their do-not-disturb rule to message the kids to check in, but once Agatha pointed that they would likely get hassled and told to stop worrying about them, they put a pin in the idea to revisit in a few days when the sense of missing them was a little stronger.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha had suggested they shower, Rio's own belief was that they should really have a reason for one, which Agatha had caught onto immediately. The way she had moved so easily, rolling over to lightly pin Rio to the bed, it was both laughter-inducing and impossibly sexy.
    </p>
<p>
     Being intimate with Agatha was easy because Rio trusted her without question. Even though Rio felt such a way, she was also incredibly disgruntled when she had gone to kiss her favorite spot on Agatha's neck and Agatha had pulled away in reenforcement.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have another side," Agatha had reminded her.
    </p>
<p>
     So Rio gave it a shot.
    </p>
<p>
     She was wholly dissatisfied.
    </p>
<p>
     "You don't make the same noise!" Rio had grumbled, but then immediately resumed kissing the foreign space thereafter.
    </p>
<p>
     Such a qualm came up the two additional times that Rio had gone to that spot out of mere habit to be met with distance.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha likely realized it was something she would be hearing several times over the following weeks. The way she lit up every time despite Rio's annoyance stated very apparently that it would be fine with her each instance it happened.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they were both satisfied and slick with sweat, there had been little argument from Rio when it came to showering. It was one of her favorite things to do with Agatha that was still so incredibly intimate without being overtly sexual. Sure, there were times it
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     overtly sexual, but showering together had become a deep comfort for Rio throughout the course of their relationship.
    </p>
<p>
     It was because she remembered was it was like to strip herself bare that very first time and present herself, completely void of any defenses, to Agatha. She remembered the tenderness, the softness that Agatha had exhibited the first time she had washed Rio's hair, gently scrubbed her body.
    </p>
<p>
     The beautiful thing about it was that those things were still present each time they stepped under the stream of water that was produced from any showerhead in any bathroom they were ever in. It didn't matter if it was in LA, or Auckland, or Reykjavik. Wherever they were, whenever they entered that state of vulnerability, they were always going to tend to one another with the utmost respect.
    </p>
<p>
     That was never going to change.
    </p>
<p>
     Wrapped in towels shortly after, the were stationed on their respective sides of the room, rifling through clothing to decide what to wear for their evening out with their new acquaintances.
    </p>
<p>
     "Argh!" Agatha cried, tossing a blouse aside, the disdain for the task at hand clear in the sound of her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "My love? Are you alright over there?" Rio questioned, glancing over her shoulder to see Agatha on her knees, ripping things out of her suitcase.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know what to wear!" she cried back in frustration.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio considered this for a minute.
    </p>
<p>
     "Want to continue our tradition?" Rio asked softly, straightening up from her own search so that she could turn and pace toward Agatha, placing a light hand on her bare shoulder, giving it a light squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     "Our tradition?" Agatha returned, confused as she lifted her chin to look up at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, it's not a tradition yet, but it can be. You let me pick your dress for the wedding. What if... For dates and big events, we do it then too?"
    </p>
<p>
     After a moment of thought, the understanding slowly melted into Agatha's expression. She seemed to consider the idea, and possibly even the implications of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Dressing oneself was a fact of human life. It was something everyone did every single day to present themselves to the world. What Rio was offering right then was a mutual understanding and trust. Not only that, but it was centered in the same intention that it had been when it had come up in reference to their wedding attire.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew what looked best on Agatha and what suited the image she wanted to present to the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew the exact same thing when it came to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     If such an offer could alleviate the stress of not being able to make a decision, wasn't it worth contemplation?
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm not wearing a dress tonight," Agatha informed her, tilting her head back a little more so that those blue eyes met Rio's own green ones. "I didn't even pack one."
    </p>
<p>
     "Which means you packed suits instead?" Rio questioned, her lips curling into a delighted smile. When Agatha nodded, Rio clapped her hands in excitement. "Perfect! Let me in there. You go over there and find me something cute, hm?"
    </p>
<p>
     She gave a light squeeze to Agatha's shoulder, a silent request for compliance. Wordlessly, Agatha rose to her feet, turning so they were face-to-face.
    </p>
<p>
     "How do you
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     that?" Agatha asked her. While there was astonishment in the sound of her voice, there was something else on her face, something in those eyes as they bored into Rio's, giving her that sensation she had never really stopped feeling since she met Agatha. It was the one where it was like Agatha was able to look right through her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know, I used to ask you that same question all the time. I only stopped because I don't think there will ever be an answer, my love."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio meant it.
    </p>
<p>
     The answer to that question was simply that there was no answer at all.
    </p>
<p>
     There was no combination of words in any written language that could summarize that connection, that mutual understanding that ran between them.
    </p>
<p>
     Realizations like that, they were almost enough to push Rio to those spirals of contemplating existentialism, of wondering how something so vast could still be so true. There were things in the world that were solid, and Rio knew their love was one, but at the same time, it could not be contained.
    </p>
<p>
     How could she, a mere mortal, be capable of such multitudes?
    </p>
<p>
     How could they, as a couple, possess the abilities they did when it came to what they felt for one another?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew the logic there would never exist and that had to be good enough. She had to find solace in it or lose herself in a spiral of being
     <em>
      too
     </em>
     self-aware. Her present was comfortable,  enough that it pushed her to keep that from happening.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tilted forward, pressing a kiss to the corner of Agatha's mouth before giving her a light nudge to encourage her to set about her task. When she obliged, Rio dove into her own a.k.a. Agatha's suitcase. It took her a grand total of a minute to locate what she wanted, about halfway down on the right side.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a very dark blue suit, so dark it was almost black. There were the smallest eggshell stripes that ran down the entire length. Even with the way it was folded as she lifted it out, she knew exactly what Agatha looked like when she put it on. Pleased with that decision, she set to her next marker of deciding what to pair with it. After another moment of rummaging, she had procured a turtleneck roughly the same color as the pinstripes on the suit, a triumphant grin winding up her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     As she got to her feet, Agatha spoke from behind her, presenting her with a question she hadn't anticipated.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do I get to do your hair too?"
    </p>
<p>
     In a flash, Rio was so warm that she was certain she'd turned at least six different shades of red. She was simply so taken by it, by the way Agatha had asked such a thing. Rio shuffled over, cradling her selection in her arms as she tried to peer over Agatha's shoulder to see what she was looking at. Before she could catch a glimpse, Agatha waved a hand to ward her off.
    </p>
<p>
     "And why do you want to do my hair, my love?" she inquired.
    </p>
<p>
     As if to answer her question, Agatha held up the cream colored knit sweater she had been ruminating on. To elaborate, she spoke. "I really like the cut of the neckline on this, and I
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     like the way your neck looks when you have your hair up when you wear it." She turned her head enough that she could see Rio, that look in her eyes requesting confirmation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had no opposition to such an ask, she was just still recovering from the tenderness of such a request, even if there was an ulterior motive behind it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, Agatha, you can pull my hair up for me."
    </p>
<p>
     The softest growl of triumph came from low in Agatha's throat, almost a chuckle but not quite.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio floated toward the bed, laying her choice atop the corner of the bed and turned around in time to see Agatha get to her feet. In addition to the sweater, she was holding a pair of black skinny jeans in her other hand, radiating with pride at the selection she had made.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha's eyes dropped to the bed, Rio's bounty splayed out and waiting, her lips immediately parted in the wide showing of teeth that expressed how much it tickled her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know me so well. I... Probably would have thought it too much and passed on to something else. So... thank you."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio approached, sneaking a quick peck as she took the clothing from Agatha's hold and they set about preparing for the evening ahead of them. It took little over a half an hour by the time they were both dressed and presentable, Rio there in her sweater and jeans with her hair pulled back into a ponytail and Agatha in her not-quite-casual suit, hair straightened as it cascaded down her back.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, the mismatched pair that they were.
    </p>
<p>
     And yet, they made so much sense.
    </p>
<p>
     Venturing into the city, they had stowed away in a little noodle shop, enjoying a quick bit while they waited for Sædís to text Agatha that they were heading to the bar. The conversation had been typical for them; it was giggle inducing, airy and wholesome. It amazed Rio, really, that they simply seemed to never run out of things to talk about. She could get used to a life like that with Agatha, no questions asked.
    </p>
<p>
     As they were cleaning up their area, Agatha's phone dinged from its poisition on the table. With little effort, she scooped it up and opened the message. She took a moment to type back a short response and then locked the phone again, that dazzling smile filling her face as she informed Rio that the other pair were on their way to the bar and that with a ten minute cab ride, they would get there at roughly the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been right.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio placed her hand into Agatha's and climbed out of the car, both Sædís and her girlfriend were standing just to the left of the entrance, wide smiles on their faces. They were an adorable pair, really. Sædís was taller, her blonde hair curled in loose ringlets that wove into the fur on the collar of her coat. Her cheeks were pink from the cold and those bright honey eyes shimmered in the lights overhead. Holding her hand, her girlfriend was a good four or five inches shorter with shoulder length dark hair that fell straight over her collar. There was a silver hoop in her right nostril and from the way she was smiling as they approached, Rio could see the small silver horseshoe that sat beneath her top lip, hanging to the very top of her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      That's cute as fuck,
     </em>
     Rio caught herself thinking. Before her mind had the chance to run away with her, the two stepped forward, Sædís offering a hand to Agatha who shook it firmly.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's great to see you both again," Sædís offered, her tone light and sweet. After she shook Rio's hand, too, she made the introduction that needed making. "Agatha, Rio, this is my girlfriend Elfa. Elfa, Agatha and Rio."
    </p>
<p>
     "Pleasure to meet you," Agatha greeted, giving her hand a strong shake.
    </p>
<p>
     When the other woman turned to Rio, something overtook her. It was something that did not allow her to filter what transferred from her brain and fell out of her mouth. It was almost like she were possessed, unable to keep herself from speaking.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's a beautiful name," she started, but it was the follow-up that she probably should have tossed aside. "What does it mean?"
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Elfa spoke, Rio knew exactly why she had asked such a question.
    </p>
<p>
     "It means 'river,'" she answered back with pride, a bright smile on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     It was cold out, sure, but that wasn't the reason Rio felt a sheet of goosebumps skate across her skin. Still, the chill did not keep the excitement from filling her entire face, smile wide and full.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mine, too."
    </p>
<p>
     There was this little bubble around the four of them for just those couple of introductory moments that was so very cozy and comforting. Yes, they were thousands of miles away from anywhere they would have called home. However, just those first few moments of small talk felt like they actually belonged there, not just as some aimless pair of tourists, but as people who respected the culture and simply wanted to learn from it and experience it for themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     After a couple of minutes, the four of them migrated inside and took seats at the bar. Agatha placed a finger to the drink menu that laid at the far side of the bar and pulled it to rest between them, flipping it open just as she flashed a grin at Rio. As they both looked down at it, they erupted into laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     It was all in Icelandic.
    </p>
<p>
     Such an idiot move, but one that caused the other two women to join in the chorus of jovial sounds.
    </p>
<p>
     "We do not mind translating," Sædís offered, pulling forward a menu of her own so that she could survey the options. "Any alcohol preference?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Not gin."
     <br/>
     "Not gin."
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Rio and Agatha spoke at the same time, the other two women first blinked and then fell prey to amused giggles, just watching the two of them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay," Elfa gushed, leaning her cheek against her fist on the bar, "that was damn adorable."
    </p>
<p>
     Once Sædís had regained her bearings, though the corners of her eyes were still wrinkled from the way her cheeks were lifted, she glanced back down at the cocktail menu. "That takes the Robot Chicken, Singapore Sling and Basil Gin Fizz off the table. If you're not opposed to mezcal, I highly suggest the Naked and Famous."
    </p>
<p>
     As though it were a knee-jerk reaction, Rio snorted from her position on the other side of Agatha. She raised a hand to her mouth, trying to temper the reaction but the night before in the hot tub so very quickly flashed through her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     In her own snappy response, Agatha's hold jutted down to anchor to Rio's thigh, giving it a tame squeeze that asserted Agatha could sense exactly what was running through her mind. Catching such a hint, Rio tried to quell the intensity of her grin, but her quip found its way out nonetheless.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sounds exactly like something you'd like," she divulged, but managed to keep the humored tremble from taking her over.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know if I'm feeling it tonight," Agatha returned, though she did not seem to mean it as any kind of double entendre that was defensive in any regard toward Rio's light teasing. "What about... Vodka?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Hm," Sædís huffed in thought, dragging her fingertip down the length of the menu and back up again. "For vodka, there's the usual suspects... Martini, Cosmopolitan, Monkey's Mule... There's a Frozen Pornstar Martini?" Even she could not get through that one without chuckling, though Rio had gained the sense that this was not the other couple's first time there.
    </p>
<p>
     "Anything rum wise?" Rio questioned, leaning forward a little on her elbows for peer down the bar at the woman holding the menu.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mai Tai and mojito are your only options, sadly," Sædís responded. "But! They do have several wine selections and the Icelandic beers they have on draught are delightful."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze shifted to Agatha who looked over at her, almost reading her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     "You want a side car, huh?" Agatha teased, giving Rio's thigh a light squeeze at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     "I do. But I suppose I can settle for a mojito. It won't kill me," came Rio's response, her hand dropping to slide overtop Agatha's so that she could grip it gently.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd placed the order for their drinks, which Sædís and Elfa assured they were covering for the evening. Agatha had tried to put up some form of protest, but Sædís hadn't backed down. She had insisted that it was a simple gesture of kindness that came with well wishes for a healthy and successful marriage, not hesitating to include that they had branded themselves for one another not once, but twice, using her hand to do so.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been funny, watching Agatha try to drive a bargain that she was never going to win. Rio was fascinated, watching as Agatha operated with that usual finesse trying to commandeer the situation as she might have under any other circumstance, but Sædís put up a valiant effort. Honestly, Rio was impressed.
    </p>
<p>
     Once they collected their drinks, Elfa had been the one to suggest they relocate to a booth so that it would be easier to share in conversation as opposed to leaning over the bar to try and shout at each other, especially Rio and Elfa who capped the ends.
    </p>
<p>
     Over the next hour or so, the drinks kept coming and the chatter never stopped. The two natives shared local stories and ideas of things to see in their time there. Agatha, who had left room for something like this to come up, had taken notes, pulling a couple of things up on her phone to bookmark so that she could look into them later.
    </p>
<p>
     They talked about sledding sites to visit only after Rio admitted that she was nowhere near ready to learn how to snowboard or ski. Between Agatha, Sædís, and Elfa, they had
     <em>
      nearly
     </em>
     won her over on the idea of going ice skating. As that conversation seemed to draw to a close, Agatha glanced up, leaning toward the opening of the booth as if she were looking for something.
    </p>
<p>
     "Looking for the ladies?" Sædís asked, raising an indicatory pointer finger over Agatha's shoulder. "Down there and to the right."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a nod of thanks and leaned over to place a soft kiss to Rio's cheek as she excused herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio finished her third drink and admittedly, she was a bit past the point of being buzzed and was toeing the line of being actually drunk. One more would likely do it, but before that could happen, Sædís -- sat directly across from Rio -- had something that she could no longer seem to bite back.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know," she began, tracing the rim of her glass in front of her with a couple of fingertips, "we don't get a lot of famous faces around here, much less in the shop."
    </p>
<p>
     Ah, and here Rio thought they were flying under the radar.
    </p>
<p>
     "So you
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     know," came Rio's smooth response, but her lips were curling before she finished speaking.
    </p>
<p>
     "When I said I was a writer, what I did not say was that I was a screen writer," Elfa revealed as she leaned back into the booth, Sædís' arm falling easily around her shoulders. "I have personally never had the pleasure, obviously, but I have contacts who have brushed elbows."
    </p>
<p>
     "But..." Rio started, her brow furrowing the slightest bit. "Neither of you said anything..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Because," Sædís voiced this time, tilting her head in a comforting and friendly manner, "that isn't why you're here. You're here to celebrate the newness of your marriage and your very clear love for one another. Those are the people we wanted to befriend."
    </p>
<p>
     For the briefest skip out of time, Rio found herself in one of those moments where the complexities of the human condition were so obvious there in front of her face. They had spent their time traveling from continent to continent and surely, at least one person they crossed paths with knew who Agatha was. Maybe they made it known on occasion, maybe they didn't. To hear that kind of a sentiment as it was delivered so freely by someone Rio could -- drunk or not -- actually consider a friend after only a couple of days, it instilled that deep softness in her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     "Plus, she got the rundown on the the woman who tamed the Wild Witch of Hollywood from Agatha herself this morning, but we wanted to get to know you more ourselves." Elfa's amusement was clear in her pretty green eyes, but it was what she said that snagged Rio's attention.
    </p>
<p>
     "'The Wild Witch of Hollywood?' Is that like... A widely known thing?" Rio probed, leaning forward a little, torso slightly hovering above the tabletop in her tipsy state.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, kind of. Wild because of her consistent TMZ appearances with various women for... several years. Witch because... Well, she rules with an iron fist. Anyone in the industry knows that." Sædís was gentle in her delivery, both knowing that it could be a sensitive topic but also wanting to answer Rio's questions honestly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let this settle for a moment, wishing she had another drink. She knew that she and Agatha had been very different people in their lives before their paths had crossed. Where Rio had chosen to isolate in the struggles life had dealt her, Agatha had done the exact opposite. Agatha had been honest with Rio about that much. It wasn't so much that she was surprised, or even upset by the mention, it was just the sudden weight of realizing
     <em>
      just how much
     </em>
     Agatha truly did love her. She had stowed away years of conquests and physical relationships because she had chosen to commit herself to Rio. It was that simple and yet, it still felt so impossibly complex.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had wielded her reputation like a weapon for so very long, one that people on other continents were even aware of. Now, they were aware that the only face Agatha had been seen with on TMZ in almost a year was Rio's.
    </p>
<p>
     Elfa reached for her drink -- the vibrant green having faded with the way the ice had melted -- and took a sip, thinking for a moment before she spoke. "She still carries that intimidating air, but it's very clear that you are her soft spot, and that she loves you."
    </p>
<p>
     "And the wedding looked gorgeous," Sædís added.
    </p>
<p>
     At the same time she dropped the compliment, Agatha slid back into the booth, her hips nestling flush against Rio's. This distraction probably served well because it did not allow time for Rio to question that someone she did not know had just brought up the appearance of their very private wedding ceremony where they had been rigid in their request that photos not be posted until they were ready.
    </p>
<p>
     Ignorance was bliss, perhaps.
    </p>
<p>
     "What did I miss?!" Agatha asked animatedly in a way that informed Rio she, too, was feeling the alcohol. Neither of them stopped Elfa from flagging down a waitress and requesting one more round, though.
    </p>
<p>
     "I learned something new," Rio divulged. A thrilled smirk twisted its way up her lips as her hand came to rest on Agatha's thigh, fingertips digging playfully into the muscle there. "My Wild Witch."
    </p>
<p>
     For just a moment, Agatha's eyes went so wide Rio was tipsily concerned that they were going to fall out of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     "My love," Rio crooned soothingly as she leaned into her wife, pressing her lips to Agatha's cheek. "It was a different life. But... It's got a nice ring to it."
    </p>
<p>
     She could feel there next to her as the tension eased out of Agatha, her posture slackening a little.
    </p>
<p>
     "Wow, I'm gone for five minutes and you two just throw me under the bus? Thanks a bunch," she shot across the table, but she was smiling. Sure, it probably startled her a bit, but she knew it was never going to be something Rio held against her. "And here I thought I'd managed to go incognito."
    </p>
<p>
     The waitress returned with their drinks and Rio couldn't help the soft snickering that escaped her at the way Agatha had nearly downed half of hers in one go before nearly slamming it back on the table. She was clearly a little flustered, though Rio maintained both the closeness of how they sat as well as the hold she had on Agatha's thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     With a little more back and forth, they had finished their last round of drinks and the other women declared that they should probably retire for the evening. Although they had no responsibilities, Rio knew that she and Agatha were probably intoxicated enough that returning to their little corner of the world was likely a smart choice for them, too.
    </p>
<p>
     In a comical showing of tripping out of the booth and trying to put their coats on, the four women finally made their way out of the bar and into the bitterly cold night air to hail cabs. The first one had rolled to the curb and Rio and Agatha both agreed the other women could take it.
    </p>
<p>
     Before they loaded into the back, both Sædís and Elfa wrapped them each in a warm embrace.
    </p>
<p>
     "Blessuð to you both," Sædís voiced as she released Rio from their hug. "And if you decide to go ice skating..." Her eyes drifted to Agatha and her drunken grin sparkled in the streetlights. "You have my number if you'd like company."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha offered a kind smile and a nod in return. "Oh, absolutely. If I can get blades on her feet, I would like as many witnesses as I can get." This earned her a gentle elbow from Rio as it landed in her middle, a soft
     <em>
      oof
     </em>
     passing through her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Goodnight, ladies. Thank you for spending the evening with us." As Sædís finished speaking, the two of them each offered a wave and folded into the back seat of their cab before it rolled off. This allowed for Agatha to hail another while she cradled a drunk Rio beneath her arm against her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     "Wanna know a secret?" Rio murmured against the smooth fabric of Agatha's coat, her voice higher pitched but soft in volume.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, my love, I would love to know a secret," Agatha answered, though a inebriated giggle tumbled from her lips shortly after. She waved her hand again, finally catching the attention of an oncoming car that pulled to the curb, clearly marked.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you the most out of everything in the whole wide world."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shifted slightly so that she could help Rio into the car, though she had not missed the confession. Instead, she waited until they were situated in the back seat of the car to make her response.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio settled against Agatha's side, eyes sliding shut contenedly as Agatha's answer rumbled softly out of her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll keep that secret on the condition that you keep mine."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah?" Rio lifted her head a bit to look at her wife, her expression mildly curious. "And what's your secret?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand lifted so that she could drag a fingertip down between Rio's eyebrows to the tip of her nose, giving the bulb a soft tap.
    </p>
<p>
     "That I love you more than that," Agatha told her, honest but knowing the response it would draw. And she was right.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey! Absolutely not!" Rio responded, her face scrunching in a pout.
    </p>
<p>
     "I dunno... How could we find out?" Agatha teased, cocking an interrogatory brow at the exact same moment a devilish smirk curled her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, I will show you the second we get back!" Rio assured her, though her pout had come to rest somewhere between a scowl and a frown.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's smirk deepend and grew a shade more wicked.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, please tell me that's a promise."
    </p>
<p>
     "It's one hundred percent a promise!" Rio assured her defiantly, a little too drunk to realize she had just played right into Agatha's hand.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Perfect."

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "No, no no no!
     <em>
      Agatha!
     </em>
     It's seven, four, two,
     <em>
      nine,
     </em>
     " Rio corrected, her weight tipping just enough that the only reason she hadn't fallen over was Agatha stood there next to her, trying to punch in the code to the front door for the third time.
    </p>
<p>
     For the third time, the numbers flashed red and the lock refused to whir.
    </p>
<p>
     "What the fuck?!" Agatha shouted, her frustration creeping to a boiling point.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was giggling, her face turning into Agatha's shoulder to find momentary relief from the cold that was nipping at her cheeks the longer they could not get into the house.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you hit the nine?" Rio questioned, words rocky as she tried to stop her giggles long so that she could get through the question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes!" Agatha griped back, leaning forward slightly to try and get a better view of the keypad. Rio swayed with her, still clinging to her side in fear that if she let go, her feet would betray her and she would tip over. "Seven. Four. Two. Nine." Agatha punctuated each spoken number with a press and finally, the numbers flashed green and the lock spun.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment the door swung open, Rio realized they had to move. She
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     move. It was just that in the time since they had left the bar, that final drink had settled and there was a delightful tilt to the world that she could not quite escape. It was alright, she had Agatha to prop her up. Well, until they had to move.
    </p>
<p>
     "One foot in front of the other, babe," Agatha tried to coach, successfully shuffling them inside so she could kick the door shut a little harder than she probably meant to as she let Rio go. The slamming sound it made caused Rio to squeal, jumping in a way that her lack of purchase on the ground caused her to sway. Like a whip, Agatha's hands were up and catching her by the shoulders to keep her steady.
    </p>
<p>
     "Baby, you gotta stay on your feet for us to get upstairs," Agatha tried to explain, though her own giggles were beginning to bubble in tune with Rio's. "Come on, coat off."
    </p>
<p>
     "Shouldn't you buy me dinner first?" Rio quipped back, shifting her arms to accommodate Agatha's removal of her coat. The moment it was dropped to the floor, Agatha shed her own and stepped forward. Rio didn't move, other than to tip back slightly as Agatha walked into her, those strong but tender hands finding station on her hips.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did," Agatha reminded her with a lopsided grin. "Like... four hours ago. It was... Um... It was noodles!" Her brows hiked and those blue eyes were wide as she was hit with the recollection.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh." Rio blinked, as if it hit her too. "Shit, you're right. You did! Well..." She threw her arms up in her pause, the wide sleeves of her jumper sliding down them as she did so. "You have permission to strip away, then!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, okay, but..." Their laughter seemed to be infectious in that the moment one of them stopped, the other started and it just bounced back and forth between them. Agatha drew in a ragged breath, trying to beat away the laughter and smooth out her expression to ask what Rio almost thought was going to be a very serious question. "Do you think it would be easier to go upstairs dressed or naked?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha?!" Rio trilled, dissolving again into a puddle of those raucous sounds of humor.
    </p>
<p>
     "The longer you take to answer, the longer it takes me to get you there and throw you on the bed," Agatha informed her, tipping her head knowingly at the same time she implemented a firm squeeze to Rio's hips.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's face was aching with just how much she was grinning, so stupidly smitten with that bossy woman she loved so very much.
    </p>
<p>
     "Let's go now and make the decision later!" Rio decided before turning to take off, leaving a beaming but confused Agatha in her wake, stuck in place for just a moment with amazement.
    </p>
<p>
     "Didn't you just -- I -- ?" Her question faded before she was finished with it as Rio booked her way up the stairs, foot catching on the third one from the top. As she started to go down, a pair of strong arms hooked beneath her own and caught her, though Agatha's weight pressed into her and they almost toppled forward anyway. The only thing that saved them was Agatha's removal of one arm to cling to the stairway railing.
    </p>
<p>
     "Whoops! Thanks, my love," Rio bumbled, lips blustering as she blew a raspberry in the midst of righting herself to finish making her way up the stairs. She did not completely miss the way she felt Agatha's hands on her sides to steady her, even as they wound down the hallway to the bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio staggered her way toward the bed, the front of her denim-covered thighs bumping into the edge of the mattress at the exact same time Agatha walked directly into her back, causing the laughter to spill from them once more.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're a bad driver," Rio teased, but before she could say anything else, Agatha's hands had lifted, reaching to take hold of the bottom of her jumper, pulling it up without a second thought.
    </p>
<p>
     Her compliance came easily, arms lifting above her head so that it could be removed, though her quiet giggles were not fading. Agatha tossed it away and those warm palms landed back on Rio's hips. This time, though, Agatha's lips found a home on the side of Rio's neck, kissing up the length of it that was so easily accessible due to the way she had allowed Agatha to pull her hair back earlier in the evening.
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio felt Agatha's hands slide forward along the waist of her jeans, her own raised to gently encircle Agatha's wrists. It wasn't a tap on the brakes or a request to slow down; It was nothing more than a need for contact, a way to try and find the slightest bit of focus in her drunken haze. Agatha's lips moved at pace with her hands which easily popped the button on Rio's jeans, nimble fingers deftly lowering the zipper.
    </p>
<p>
     The softest sigh fell between parted lips and Rio tilted her head both back and toward the side opposite of Agatha, exposing a broader surface area for her to feast upon. It only took a few seconds before that wasn't satisfying anymore.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio whispered, tucking her bottom lip between her teeth as she felt Agatha push her jeans down over her hips.
    </p>
<p>
     The low response that came from Agatha was hot against Rio's skin as Agatha kissed over her shoulder and just slightly down her back on the left side as she bent so that she could get Rio's jeans to a point where they dropped to pool around her ankles.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Yes, my love?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     A dry tongue passed through Rio's lips in an attempt to wet them but it was useless. Her breath caught low in her chest as Agatha kissed her way back up to Rio's neck, teeth skimming playfully along the skin over her trapezius muscle.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I... I, um... I wanna try something,"
     </em>
     Rio informed her, the incline of her chin dropping as her head lowered cautiously as her request landed.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "What do you wanna try?"
     </em>
     came Agatha's inquiry, palms resting flatly over the front of Rio's hips.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio turned in place, forcing Agatha to lift her touch to allow for the movement. Despite her inebriation, Rio's hands found the lapel of Agatha's blazer easily, gripping it tight enough to allow an easy removal of it as she pushed it over Agatha's shoulders and down her arms. It hit the floor without a sound and in the next second, Rio was on her way to having Agatha's sweater off.
    </p>
<p>
     As it, too, was thrown aside, Rio's fuzzy brain stopped there, having got to the point she was hoping to reach. She stepped into Agatha and brought an arm around her, as though to embrace her. Agatha must have though Rio was going to kiss her, because she puckered, but Rio's lips pressed instead to the top of Agatha's shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     "What -- ?" Agatha began, but Rio's hand landed on its target: the clasp in the center of Agatha back.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Aha!"
     </em>
     Rio exclaimed against Agatha's skin. With the lone grip, she attempted to work the clasp free but she was finding nothing but resistance.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio, what -- What are you doing?" Agatha asked her, turning her head slightly as her laughter escaped her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I wanna do that thing!" Rio returned as she pulled her head up, but did not place any space between them, still trying to pour her focus in unhooking Agatha's bra.
    </p>
<p>
     "What thing?" Agatha posted back coyly, knowing exactly what Rio was referring to.
    </p>
<p>
     "That
     <em>
      thing!
     </em>
     " Rio whined in return, giving Agatha's back a light smack over the band of her bra.
    </p>
<p>
     With impossible speed and ridiculous awareness, Agatha's hand raised and her arm hooked around Rio's back, fingers finding the clasp of
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     bra with ease. In all of five seconds, Agatha had pinched, shifted, and unhooked Rio's bra, dropping her hand as the band split and hung loose.
    </p>
<p>
     "That thing?"
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, she was something else.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes!" Rio groaned, stomping her foot in the smallest tantrum. "I wanna do that!"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     laughed this time, an intoxicated but bright and tickled sound that caused Rio's indignant pouting to intensify. Her brow was so pinched that it almost became one and her lip was pushed out.
    </p>
<p>
     Sure, Rio was a little annoyed, but what Agatha was seeing right then? It likely only made her love Rio more.
    </p>
<p>
     "You just have to practice, my love," Agatha informed her, leaning forward to steal a kiss off of those pouty lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's dumb," Rio shot back.
    </p>
<p>
     With complete ease, Agatha reached behind herself, her fingers brushing against the back of Rio's hand before they slid beneath her touch, unhooking her own bra quickly. This seemed to place a decent sized dent in Rio's pride.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey! Why did you do that?" she asked in a deep whine.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because we're drunk and you're not gonna figure that out tonight and I think my head between your legs happening sooner rather than later would be preferable to you practicing the art of bra-unclasping." Agatha's answer was factual, pointed.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh. Yes. She was right.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay fine," Rio conceded in a huff, her hands landing flat on Agatha's sides so they could glide toward the front of her trousers, successfully able to get
     <em>
      those
     </em>
     unfastened, at least. Her fingertips tucked into the waist not only of the trousers, but Agatha's underwear too and she pushed them down at the same time Agatha removed her bra. The moment they hit the ground around her ankles, Rio was graced with just a moment of appreciation for the stark naked woman in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     Her wild witch.
    </p>
<p>
     Her wild witch with an even wilder heart.
    </p>
<p>
     As those beautiful green eyes simply swept over what she could see without having to step back, Rio felt both feral and smitten at the same time, completely in awe that this was everything to her. It was her mornings, her afternoons, her evenings and nights. Agatha was Sunday morning coffee and Saturday afternoon rugby games. Agatha was Monday morning reassurance and Friday night wine and kisses.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was everything good about being in love, Rio was sure of that much.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're really pretty," Rio informed her, tones softer, more indulgent to her appreciation of what was right there in front of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's smile was instant, but it was still gentle as to not break the moment. Before she made any other move, she reached up and slid the straps of Rio's bra down her arms so the garment could be discarded, tossed to land amongst every other article of clothing that was no longer needed when it was just the two of them alone in a bedroom with so much love filling them that the only logical way to show it was through touch, through physicality. To finish the process, she pushed Rio's panties over her hips, too before those blue eyes were looking right into her.
    </p>
<p>
     The palm Agatha placed to the curve of Rio's jaw felt precious, like she was aware that what she was touching was the most valuable thing in the world to her. Rio could
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     that care, that respect, that complete appreciation. Agatha leaned, just the slightest bit, so that she could brush their lips together. It wasn't an initiation of something deeper, not yet. It was the gentlest, quickest contact that broke a few seconds after it started.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You're really pretty too. Like the kind of pretty in dreams. The kind of pretty that makes me blush sometimes. The kind of pretty that also makes me wanna pin you to any flat surface I can find sometimes."
     </em>
     Those murmured words landed one after another right in Rio's middle, melting her further and burning her up even hotter. By the time Agatha had stopped speaking, Rio was staring at her, directly in those probing, informed blue eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips lifted as a smirk formed.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Then what the heck are you waiting for?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's features shifted, an expression filling her face that was somehow both reverent and lustful at the same time. She was seeing Rio in this rare form, this state of being where her inhibitions were nil and her heart was running away from her, only for Agatha to be the one it was running to.
    </p>
<p>
     Words were no longer needed. No, not anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     At least, Agatha didn't seem to think so.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was still lagging slightly, not able to clock the movement before Agatha's other hand was on the empty side of her jaw, pulling her forward. That kiss wasn't like the first one. The kiss that Agatha planted on Rio right then? That kiss was a
     <em>
      kiss.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Even for how drunk they were, Rio felt it everywhere at once. She felt it in her chest as her heart began to hammer harder there. She felt it in her stomach as it twisted and flipped over itself in her midsection. She felt it in her head, in the way it made her feel like she'd just thrown back another pair of drinks at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could taste the vodka from her martini still on Agatha's tongue and could feel the way her heart skipped in a rush of just how much she loved it.
    </p>
<p>
     They were growing each and every day and the fact that they'd gone out and made friends for the first time together felt like an achievement. It felt good, really good.
    </p>
<p>
     But it didn't feel quite as good as the way Agatha's hands did when they let go of Rio's face and landed on both sides of her ass, fingertips digging hungrily into the flesh there. It didn't feel as good as the way the tip of Agatha's tongue traced the lightest line across the center of the roof of her mouth, catching the back of her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     That exchange of both spit and emotion ended as Agatha pulled back, her eyes flickering over Rio's shoulder to the bed in suggestion, dropping back to take in her wife as if to ask the question again. Rio grinned, stealing another kiss before she backed into the mattress and sat, lifting herself so that she could scamper toward the head of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Landing in the plush comfort of the mattress, her gaze lifted to behold Agatha who was shifting to all fours as she stalked forward, crawling over where Rio had placed herself, half-propped against the pillows. The moment she got close enough, they were kissing again and Rio's palms were quickly cradling both sides of Agatha's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't let that one last as long, using her hold to both indicate what she wanted and try to assist in getting it as she pushed Agatha gently to the side, causing her to first land on her hip and then to roll to her back so Rio could sidle up to her. Her lips found an intended target in the crook of Agatha's neck, kissing up the expanse of skin, headed straight toward her ear. The moment she placed a kiss just beneath it, her expression puckered in both misunderstanding and immediate distaste.
    </p>
<p>
     That felt different.
    </p>
<p>
     Not like Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck, that damn tattoo and that stupid saniderm.
    </p>
<p>
     A long and frustrated groan rattled out of Rio, her brows pinching as she lifted her head, eyes shifting to Agatha who had a ridiculous grin on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "This is bullshit!" Rio complained, lips turning down at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
     "Baby," Agatha cooed, her head tilting slightly on the pillow, though her laughter was still dancing in her eyes despite not being vocal. "I have another side."
    </p>
<p>
     "It's not the same!" Rio's drunken indignancy made her words sharp and high, a gripe in shrill form.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can make that noise on that side too if I try --"
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't you dare! If you fake it I will be so mad at you!" Rio was almost offended at such a suggestion, though she knew Agatha was proposing it as a way to try and help her through a fact that could not be changed for at least a few weeks.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well that what do you want from meeee?!" came Agatha's feigned whine, her lip jutting out in a mock pout.
    </p>
<p>
     "For you not to be so sentimental! You're killing my buzz," Rio informed her, those lips still turned down at the corners in her dissatisfaction.
    </p>
<p>
     "You could try the other side?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's frown deepened even further, if it were at all possible.
    </p>
<p>
     "Or I could go to sleep because if you tried to make that noise I would dry up like the desert," Rio returned in challenge, both of her brows hiking up. The alarm this caused was obvious on Agatha's face in the blink of an eye and she spread her legs wide, her knee bumping into Rio's thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     "No! I won't! I promise! Just kiss my lips! Or my nipples! Or kiss me where you know I like it most!" Agatha's words were rushed, but they were pitched in the way that only happened because they were being pushed out through her ear-to-ear grin.
    </p>
<p>
     "How will I know you really mean it when you moan?" Rio interrogated with a pressing tip of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because I always mean it," Agatha responded, her eyes soft as she batted those eyelashes at her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     "Promise?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted her hand, cupping Rio's cheek affectionately as the pad of her thumb ran along the curve of Rio's cheek bone, so ready and willing to offer the reassurance her little drunken brain seemed to need.
    </p>
<p>
     "I promise. Can you maybe kiss me now, though?" Agatha returned, her voice softening as she pouted once more.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio slumped, her hand landing on Agatha's stomach in her surrender.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I can do that,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured back, ducking her head at the same time she hooked a leg over Agatha's thigh. The sudden movement caused Agatha's thumb to slip, poking right into Rio's eye.
    </p>
<p>
     The furious giggles from both of them were so very bright in the darkness of the night.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You poked me in the eye,"
     </em>
     Rio crowed, both shocked and thrown into her immense merriment at the hilarity of it all.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Let me kiss it better,"
     </em>
     Agatha cooed at her, tilting her chin while she waited for Rio to close her eyes. The moment she did, Agatha placed a soft kiss to her eyelid.
     <em>
      "There. All better."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes fluttered open, impossibly soft as she took in the sight of Agatha beneath her. That beautiful, wild woman that made no sense and yet made all the sense in the world, somehow at exactly the same time. Rio loved her, more than she knew she could ever even try to say. But she put forth the effort anyway.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     This time, Agatha's hand landed on Rio's neck, her fingers sliding into her hair to grip gently.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you, too."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     As if the temperature had dropped from a hot desert noon to a balmy tropical evening, so had the frantic and intoxicated frenzy, falling more into a weighted deference shared between the two of them. Just like that.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a light tug, urging Rio to drop more carefully this time so that their mouths could find warmth and comfort in one another. That kiss was still
     <em>
      a kiss
     </em>
     , but it was tame in its own right, yet somehow not quite reserved. It was passionate, but tongues caressed more than they battled and there were fewer clicks of enamel.
    </p>
<p>
     The longer it wore on, the more restless Rio's hand on Agatha's skin grew. It rubbed small paces back and forth as she squeezed Agatha's thigh between both of her own. It wandered, up the middle of Agatha's chest, then to her far breast. The pressure applied, the attention paid were all so rooted in Rio's love for Agatha, and for Agatha's body and it felt like the easiest way to show it, even when she'd had a little too much to drink.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's tongue withdrew from its exploration of Agatha's mouth and her lips were travelling, taking every kiss they could over her chin, her throat, her collarbones. At the same time, Rio's fingertips skated lower down Agatha's abdomen. That hold on Agatha's thigh tightened again the very moment Rio's touch reached her intended destination, the tips of her fingers sliding between the folds of Agatha's skin, sinking into her slick and warm arousal.
    </p>
<p>
     The gasp that sounded from Agatha only spurred Rio on, her teeth skimming over the length of one collarbone tauntingly.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mmmm, baby,"
     </em>
     Agatha hummed as Rio's fingers began their expedition of seeking out every part of Agatha that
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     cause her to make those noises Rio loved so much. Agatha's own hand had traveled with Rio as she had moved about, placing those kisses. As Rio's touch skimmed gingerly over her clit, a rumbling whine echoed out of her, fingertips flexing into Rio's scalp.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You're so beautiful,"
     </em>
     Rio whispered against her skin, kissing as much of it that she could reach without completely breaking contact and rearranging herself. Right then, with her lips showing their appreciation and her fingers beginning to work over those tender spots, feeling out the desire Agatha so clearly felt for her, she was content with not being able to pepper those kisses
     <em>
      everywhere.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Rio,"
     </em>
     Agatha managed dryly, licking her lips as she gave a gentle tug on Rio's hair, an otherwise wordless calling for her attention.
     <em>
      "C-Can you look at me?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The question was so quiet, so reserved in its wanting. Agatha was not scared to ask for such a thing, and that only led Rio to believe that this was a little more weighted than she might have initially surmised.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio retreated from the warmth of Agatha's skin, pulling back the tiniest bit so that their eyes could meet. Agatha's lip tucked inward, catching between her teeth as she shifted her hips. The movement caused her thigh to lift, pressing directly between Rio's legs, her own core finding the briefest friction that caused her breath to catch near the back of her throat. Automatically, her eyes slid shut but Agatha was quick in her response, pressing her fingertips again into Rio's scalp.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Look at me,"
     </em>
     Agatha begged again and once more, Rio forced her eyes open as her own hips began to shift and work, reveling in the purchase she was finding against the skin of Agatha's thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha moved again, her heel digging into the mattress so that she could push her leg a little higher. Rio was almost so distracted that she faltered but quickly recovered, her calculated circling around that stiff bundle of nerves resumed and then began to trek lower. The entire time, between the grinding and the touching, Rio's eyes never left Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
     That gaze stayed fixed, even as Rio's fingers curled and pressed inside Agatha's body. Because of Agatha's request, it allowed Rio to take in every bit of the way that Agatha's lips parted and a deliciously pleased moan rolled from between them. She got a front row experience to the way her eyes flickered and rolled back into her head for those initial moments. It was right there before her as Agatha's jaw dropped lower when she worked her body into the contact, clearly wanting and needing more.
    </p>
<p>
     With such effort, she was creating exactly what Rio herself needed, her top leg hooking its way around Agatha's to hold it tighter, to keep it where she needed it to find her own pleasure. Her movements were deliberate and measured as she worked Agatha's body over beneath her fingertips, her free hand having come to land in Agatha's hair due to the positioning of her arm. That contact was still there, though, the two of them locked into one another as they drew on.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a cacophony of the breathiest whimpers and sighs, a pleased ringing of grunts and moans that were traded back and forth the longer Rio both worked herself against Agatha and worked Agatha to the budding release of an orgasm, which could could tell was quickly approaching with the way Agatha's eyes began to dart and flicker toward the ceiling before finding their way back to Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dipped her head just enough to place a kiss against Agatha's lips before she made her loving request.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Come for me, my love,"
     </em>
     she requested, working her wrist to reach deeper, to touch more of her wife that she could reach.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "N-No... Not yet!"
     </em>
     Agatha tried to fight, but the moan that followed gave away just how close she was.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio commanded in the quietest whisper.
     <em>
      "I love you. Now, come for me."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Their deadlock broke as Agatha shook her head.
     <em>
      "Noooo. I wanna come
      <b>
       with
      </b>
      you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Okay, that was even better.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio understood her loud and clear and anchored herself tightly to Agatha's thigh, her hips working with a little more fervor, her chest heaving more and more with the effort. The closer she started to feel, the quicker her pace became as she slid her fingers back and forth into Agatha's body, curling intentionally to create pressure that would pull Agatha right over the edge with her.
    </p>
<p>
     It was working. Rio knew it because Agatha let her head roll back into the pillow as her eyes pinched shut and her breath began to hitch with more frequency.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head dropped and her lips brushed Agatha's ear as she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm close. I'm so close,"
     </em>
     she told her, tone weak and desperate over the admission.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Me too. Oh god, oh god me too."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha, I -- I love you, fuck!"
      <br/>
      "Ohhhh, Rio, I love youuuuu."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Their declarations hit the air at roughly the same time their bodies found the intense pleasures they had been seeking so desperately. Those promises melted away into whimpers and cries as they worked fervently to push and pull each and every wave of the stunned orgasms that ripped through them, pulling apart every nerve and shoving them back together again. Agatha's legs had tried to snap shut somewhere in the midst of it all, but Rio had her pinned too well. Instead, Agatha's free knee locked in over Rio's and she rolled a bit in the effort.
    </p>
<p>
     All that did was allow easier access for Rio to let her lips rest against the sweat-stricken skin of Agatha's warm forehead. They were both panting and filled with immeasurable trembles the longer the pleasure seemed to cycle through them, but after a few more moments, Rio slowly removed her fingers from Agatha's core and lifted her hand to cup the side of Agatha's head.
    </p>
<p>
     With a bit more coherency, Rio placed several kisses along Agatha's hairline, her thumb brushing lovingly over Agatha's ear.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "My love,"
     </em>
     Rio crooned, and that was it. That was the statement, all that really needed to be said.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "My everything,"
     </em>
     Agatha whispered back, letting go of her hold on Rio's hair to instead place it gently around her wrist.
    </p>
<p>
     They shared a few more light kisses, including the several that Rio peppered across every inch of Agatha's face before she finally released her leglock on Agatha's thigh, settling easily against Agatha on the bed. The moment they were covered and comfortable, Rio closed her eyes and inhaled a slow and long breath, one that filled her nose with the smells of sweat and perfume and sex in a way she had only ever known with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She loved it.
    </p>
<p>
     She loved Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     So she made that known, just before she drifted off to sleep.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you the most."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The very first thing Rio noticed the next morning, before she had even opened her eyes?
    </p>
<p>
     The absolute pounding at the base of her skull, the one that turned her stomach in circles once she recognized it.
    </p>
<p>
     God, it had been so fucking long since she had a hangover and she remembered exactly why.
    </p>
<p>
     A low and pained groan slipped through her lips as she shifted, rolling to her back as a hand raised to cover her face, sliding down it. The moment she reached her chin, those green eyes begrudgingly opened into the morning.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You too, huh?"
     </em>
     Agatha asked lowly from her place beside Rio, face half shoved into the pillow from the way she was laying on her stomach.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I am never drinking anything that is not wine ever again,"
     </em>
     Rio quipped, keeping her voice quiet to not aggravate her own thundering headache.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "So we should nix the breakfast mimosas?"
     </em>
     Agatha returned coyly. Rio could hear the mischief in her words clear as day.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I swear to gods, I will throw up on you,"
     </em>
     Rio informed her, covering her eyes again at the way the mere thought made her nauseous.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Okay so I have officially found one thing you have said to me that I do not like."
     </em>
     The softest and sweetest chuckle passed through Agatha's lips as she began to shift, lifting herself off of the mattress so that she was on all fours.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio noticed the movement and pulled her hand down again, peering up at Agatha as she ducked down to steal a quick kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm gonna go get us some orange juice and Tylenol, though. Cause this sucks."
     </em>
     Agatha stole another chaste kiss and pushed off to do as she had stated she would.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, and... I think that maybe we should break our rule," she voiced, hesitating in the doorway as she looked back at Rio. "I... Miss the kids. And think that if we want to spend part of the day laying in bed while nursing these hangovers and talking to our children... I think we should."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's smile bloomed instantly, the love for her wife dancing in bright lights in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think you're right, my love. That sounds like a good idea."
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, okay," Agatha returned, realizing that she had a task to accomplish. "Stay comfy. I'll be right back."
    </p>
<p>
     With that, she was off and Rio was left, a hungover and still tired heap in that big bed. With a valiant effort, she rolled over and opened the drawer to the bedside table, plucking her phone out of it before returning to her little cradle of mattress on her back.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned it on, let it boot up and was immediately met with her lock screen; it was a photo of their family, all six of them, a week before the wedding.
    </p>
<p>
     She swiped up and while her intent had been to message Estee right away, there was something else that was nibbling at the back of her consciousness. Unable to ignore it, she brought up Google and typed in her querey.
    </p>
<p>
     'The Wild Witch of Hollywood.'
    </p>
<p>
     The results populated and by the time Agatha had returned with a couple of glasses of orange juice and a small bottle of pills, Rio was already in the process of creating an account for some website called 'tumblr' so that she could keep scrolling on the blog she had discovered as a result of her search, her curiosity piqued by the few images she
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     able to see. She sat up, pulling the comforter over her lap a bit more as her eyes raised to take in her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     "What time even is it in LA?" Agatha questioned, kneeling on the bed to hand the glass of orange juice over to Rio who also snagged the red capped bottle of Tylenol from her as well.
    </p>
<p>
     "Just after two in the morning. So... Even sending messages to the kids now, we probably wouldn't hear from them until this evening," Rio explained as she tossed two of the pills into her mouth and chased them with the juice.
    </p>
<p>
     "So then just mindless hangover scrolling, hm?" Agatha suggested, extracting her own phone from her drawer so that she could turn it on.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sounds like it to me," Rio responded, her smile bright both on her features and in the rich sound of her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a very large difference to be noted between the two of them when it came to their phones.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's was never off of vibrate.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's made sound. Always.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment everything loaded, it sounded about eight times with an alert for her email. That didn't bode well.
    </p>
<p>
     As she swiped it open, Agatha placed herself on the bed and seemed to dive right in.
    </p>
<p>
     Thirty seconds passed and an incredibly loud and very upset groan thundered out of Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Jesus fucking Christ. I'm going to kill Wyatt Landon with my own bare hands!"
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could even ask, Agatha was reaching across the space to shove the phone screen in front of Rio's face.
    </p>
<p>
     She blinked, focusing on what was directly before her.
    </p>
<p>
     Pictured there was a photo that had half of a face that belonged to Wyatt Landon himself, along with Nicky and Estee. Behind them, both Agatha and Rio were visible, if not a bit blurry.
    </p>
<p>
     "There's three of them. That idiot posted to his fucking Snapchat."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's mouth felt dry in her confusion.
    </p>
<p>
     "What does that mean?" she asked, her eyes lifting to take Agatha in.
    </p>
<p>
     "It means that the whole world now knows we got married."
    </p>
<p>
     Well.
    </p>
<p>
     Fuck.

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     There were few things in life that Rio did not understand, or at the very least did not try to understand. In those ticking seconds as she stared at Agatha, who was still holding her phone out even though Rio was no longer looking at it, Rio simply
     <em>
      couldn't
     </em>
     understand.
    </p>
<p>
     In the grand scheme of things, the furthest encounter Rio had managed up to that point with Agatha's deeply rooted celebrity status were the few instances they had been photographed by the paparazzi and those few occurrences had not been enough to deter her. That, Rio told herself, she could handle. That, she swore, would be fine.
    </p>
<p>
     It had not come to settle, even in that bar with Agatha in the washroom and those two women gushing about and dishing a bit of tea on her, that this was a far bigger picture, one that Rio did not have the scope to identify it appropriately. Rio did not understand that for the most part, with Agatha's hiatus, they had been living in the smallest bubble, hidden from the pressures and demands of Agatha's career. It had been easy to do when Agatha decided that her priorities were a little different and something she'd spent her entire life doing could now wait a little longer when more important things became prevalent.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, that look in Agatha's eyes only muddled Rio's comprehension further.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly, Rio raised a hand to take a gentle hold on Agatha's forearm, lowering the phone, breaking the tension out of her arm as she did so, lowering it into Agatha's lap.
    </p>
<p>
     "So..." Rio began, her gaze slowly trailing over Agatha's expression, looking for anything that might give her a direction or some kind of clue to work with. She was coming up empty handed. "What, exactly, does
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     mean?"
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't a pointed or harsh question, but it
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     a request for knowledge, to know why Agatha looked so spooked and upset. Rio knew that there were far too many reasons to keep count of when it came to why Agatha had been so insistent on an exclusive and private ceremony, but Rio had made another grave miscalculation in not asking to know what they were.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't necessarily blind trust, but Rio had simply come to understand Agatha enough that if there was something Rio needed to know, Agatha would find the right time to tell her. Maybe it could have been considered naive, maybe there would come a point when Rio had to realize that just as she had her past and the things she'd chosen to do, Agatha has as much in equal measure.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, it was Agatha's present that had her cheeks flushed a dark crimson and those crackles of electricity flashing in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "It means that Dave has sent me eight emails since we've been here. He has left me four voicemails that I dare not listen to," Agatha informed her, but there was a tone there, the slightest pitch, that was unfamiliar to Rio. It was an edge, a panicked run over the whetstone, sharpening.
    </p>
<p>
     This was close to what Rio had heard those first few times she'd heard Agatha speak to Dave on the phone.
    </p>
<p>
     This was Business Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "It means... It means that in those emails, he has included a list of three different outlets that are requesting quotes or interviews." Agatha stopped speaking, but shifted in her place against the pillows so that she was facing Rio a bit more. She set the phone down on the mattress, using the freed hold to fill it with Rio's hand in both of Agatha's own.  Business Agatha seemed to take a back seat as Wife Agatha made her reappearance. "I have been a very visible public figure for a very long, long time. In that visibility, the public image I had in regards to my personal life was... About the same one my son saw. And so all of a sudden, I drop off the face of the earth for the majority of eight months and then turn up married and no one knew?"
    </p>
<p>
     The more Agatha explained, the heavier Rio's stomach felt. It wasn't that she didn't know about Agatha's past exploits since her divorce, it was that to Rio, they hadn't mattered. In her mind, that should have meant that it didn't matter to anyone else. She was simply observing, like she had leapt off the top of the Empire State Building, as the very heavy reality she had been ignorant to was approaching the quicker she fell.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to be able to recognize the free falling mental state that Rio was in, watching as she careened into a reality that maybe she was not ready before. Agatha's grip flexed over Rio's hand in her own, a comforting show of silent support, a metaphorical show that Agatha was going to catch her before she made contact. Her gaze was strong, unwavering as she was fixed on Rio, trying to deduce the best way to say what she wanted to say.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can email Dave back right now and have him shoot off three 'fuck you' emails and we can let it be that..." she trailed, her gaze dropping down to their hands together before it swept back up to Rio's soft and confounded expression. "Or... You and I can sit down and go through them and we can make a decision on which one we want to interview with."
    </p>
<p>
     The disarray she had been feeling to that point seemed to sink deeper, seat itself even lower in her chest. None of this made sense, but what Agatha had just said made the least sense of all.
    </p>
<p>
     "We?" Rio asked, her lips curling down as her brow pinched tighly. "Agatha, no..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, Rio," Agatha asserted, not giving Rio room to say another word. "There is no interview about our marriage if we don't do it together." There was a rigidity, a firmness that impacted behind every word that Agatha fired off. She meant it, through and through.
    </p>
<p>
     "But... Why?" Rio questioned back, biting her lip softly as she felt Agatha squeeze her hand again.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe she was being foolish, maybe she was being childish. What she knew right then was that this was Agatha's territory and if Rio tried to insert herself within it? It wouldn't work; she knew nothing about what it took to present and interview. She wasn't camera trained, had never been given a talking point in her entire life because she had never needed it.
    </p>
<p>
     The both of them sat there, still stark naked, trying to sort through such an unexpected roadblock, one that had appeared far too soon. Agatha released one hand and lifted it, reaching up so that she could cup Rio's cheek in the palm of it. "Because, Rio... You are an entire person outside of your relationship with me. Not only that, but you had an entire life and career and child before I fell into it and you..." Agatha paused, nose scrunching a bit as she pressed her lips together, rubbing for a moment before she continued. "It's like I told you that night in the Freehand. In this relationship, you
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     have a choice. You
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     have a voice."
    </p>
<p>
     It was as though Agatha knew she needed to use those exact words in that exact way. It was as if she knew that it was the one thing Rio needed to hear, to be reminded of. What Rio had needed right then was for Agatha to pull out that metaphorical mirror out again, the one where Rio needed to see what was there in a way that would remind her of her own autonomy.
    </p>
<p>
     At the time, Agatha had likely meant it in a physical sense, but as they sat there in that bed? Rio knew that she meant it in every facet imaginable.
    </p>
<p>
     Anything they did in life, anywhere they went, Rio always got a say as far as Agatha was concerned. Rio knew it was because that was what partnership was to Agatha, true partnership. It was something she had never really allowed herself the privilege of having and as such, she wanted to do it right. That meant being willing to embrace that while they were a couple, they were still two very individual people.
    </p>
<p>
     Yes, this was Agatha's world, but it had become Rio's now, too. Was that an intimidating realization the deeper she got into it? Undeniably. However, it was not enough to push Rio into wanting to second guess anything about her life or the choices she had made.
    </p>
<p>
     Above all else, Rio loved Agatha, no matter what that included.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio loved Agatha, no matter how badly her own misconceptions were fucking with her head.
    </p>
<p>
     What she had needed to know was exactly what Agatha had said to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted herself from the pillows and leaned toward Agatha, placing their lips together in a soft kiss despite the fact that she felt twice as sick as she had when she'd woken up. She couldn't explain it, couldn't put her finger on exactly why she was feeling so unsettled. When she pulled back, she understood.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the look in Agatha's eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't that she looked worried, or nervous. It wasn't even that she looked upset.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha looked so... lost. It didn't touch anywhere else, but Rio could see it rolling back and forth in that shockingly blue gaze. She looked like she'd arrived at a checkmark entirely too soon before she'd planned to and she was now simply playing everything by ear. Obviously this was not something that they had intended on doing, but Rio found herself rather thankful that it was coming up now and not when they were preparing to head home.
    </p>
<p>
     At least with this all unfolding in that first week, they could have time to plan as well as time to recover and still devote their effort into truly experiencing their honeymoon for what it was.
    </p>
<p>
     If anything, wasn't this a prime example of their lives together? Things were good, and would still be good, but there inevitably had to be a bump in the road, a hurdle to overcome. It could never be
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     easy, and that was something Rio was also coming to terms with. What she could do, though, was promise Agatha that her hand would always be there to hold, that reminder branded into her wrist.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Okay. We can look. But... we should shower first, hm?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     In slow-motion, Rio could see the tension melt from individual points in Agatha's expression, the realization dawning on her that this was not going to be a battle. Of course it never would be. Rio loved her, and if this was what she thought would be the best thing for them? Rio believed that Agatha would always have their best intentions at heart.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Rio wasn't ready, but when had that ever mattered as it pertained to Agatha? When had there truly ever been a time that Rio had not let Agatha lead her into a situation that she had not dared to embrace before, even if she had her reserves?
    </p>
<p>
     There wasn't one she could draw from recent memory. As such, she wasn't going to start now.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha closed the space between them with another urgent but sweet kiss before she leaned back and gave a nod.
    </p>
<p>
     "But Rio..." Agatha voiced as Rio started to shift to remove herself from bed. She stilled, looking back over at Agatha. "I... I'm sorry. And I love you."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio softened, her lips curling up the slightest bit. She did not speak and instead slid off the edge of the bed and paced around to Agatha's side. Agatha seemed to catch on to what she was doing and turned around, hanging her legs over the side of the bed as she looked up at Rio who threaded her fingers through the hair on the side of Agatha's head, cradling it gently.
    </p>
<p>
     "You don't have to be sorry, Agatha. I... Could have done more research. Because... You know, it's part of my shtick... But... we'll figure it out." Rio bent at the waist, gracing Agatha with the gentlest kiss, first to her lips and then to the tip of her nose. "We'll just do it after we wash up."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio fingers started to untangle from Agatha's hair but weren't entirely removed as Agatha's hand shot up, gripping lightly at Rio's wrist. Her eyes dropped back down into Agatha's beautiful gaze, so impossibly deep and comforting.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, Rio," she informed her, keeping their eyes locked even as she turned her head to place the lightest kiss to the palm of Rio's hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know you do, Agatha, because I love you too." Rio maneuvered her arm around enough that she could scoop Agatha's hand into her own as she leaned forward quick enough to kiss the top of Agatha's head, giving her a light tug. "C'mon, my love."
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the fact that neither of them were exactly excited about the task that suddenly lay before them, their shower had been comparatively short to the majority of ones they indulged in before. It was still sweet and intimately affectionate, just a little less lengthy than typical, but it seemed comparative to the fact that both of them were distracted just enough by their own inner monologues.
    </p>
<p>
     Their normally idle chatter was gone, replaced instead with a patient silence, one that allowed them the extra time to gather themselves before they tucked into making a selection as they dressed themselves.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew they didn't have to do this. She could have told Agatha 'no' and Agatha had already made it very clear that 'no' was answer enough, one that Rio was able to choose.
    </p>
<p>
     Choosing that answer, though, didn't seem to feel quite right to Rio. Saying that she wanted to hide away in their isolation from the public perception felt an awful lot like the way she had been living the majority of her life. If so much else had changed with Agatha in the picture, shouldn't that change too? It was okay to face life head on, as long as she had a plan and Agatha right beside her. That was the greatest lesson she had learned up to that point.
    </p>
<p>
     They had spent roughly the next ninety minutes going over the options Dave had sent over in regards to press. Two were online sites -- Vogue and Variety -- and one was a late night spot, which Agatha had immediately dismissed. She had justified it by saying that for Rio's first dip into the media pool, a photographed and recorded interview was going to be more beneficial than anything broadcast. This was a process, something that was going to have to progress in the smallest steps so that Rio might be able to acclimate properly.
    </p>
<p>
     Between the two publications, Agatha did not voice an opinion one way or another, at least initially. She was trying to appear unbiased, but the longer they looked into each one, the more Rio could tell that she had a preference.
    </p>
<p>
     "You want Vogue, don't you?" Rio asked her, turning to watch that goddess-like profile as the thoughts stirred and churned inside of Agatha's head, though she kept her eyes locked on the screen of the iPad she had dug out of her bag to better accomplish such a mission. Slowly, Agatha's lips began to twist and then pressed, which led to her forcing a huff of air out of her nose.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't trust Variety with this," Agatha stated flatly, reaching forward to scroll further down the page.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because...?" Rio attempted, scooting a little closer to Agatha's side, their thighs pressing flush as she settled.
    </p>
<p>
     "We'll just say I have a very... turbulent working relationship with Variety," Agatha tried to explain, but she knew that elaboration was all but required. "They like to throw in questions they know they shouldn't and I'd prefer if our first press appearance does not end in me having to physically fight someone for saying something off-color to you."
    </p>
<p>
     For the first time since they had begun to seek out a resolution to their predicament, Rio's lips swept wide, pulling apart in a genuine, if not affectionate, smile. Agatha still wasn't looking at her, but it didn't matter. She leaned forward anyway, pressing her lips sweetly just below Agatha's eye.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is that part of you being wild too, my love? Throwing hands with anyone deserves it?" Rio asked before ducking slightly to press another kiss to Agatha's skin, this time to the corner of her mouth.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, I mean..." Agatha began, turning her head. With the way Rio was holding herself, the way Agatha stopped left their lips only a breath away.
     <em>
      "I thought that was kind of obvious."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Her eyes were open and bright, staring directly into Rio's with their proximity. The moment Agatha tipped her head, their lips met full-contact and Rio nearly melted right into it. It was almost impossible not to. Even in the face of the unknown, all Rio needed was for Agatha to ground her, to take her hand, and to guide her right through it five seconds at a time.
    </p>
<p>
     One contact broke as their lips separated and another was initiated as Agatha's forehead pressed to Rio's, both pairs eyes fluttering shut this time.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I don't mean to be so picky about this,"
     </em>
     she admitted and Rio didn't need to be able to see her to hear the deep creases of her frown.
     <em>
      "I've just... been at this a very long time and... I want you to be comfortable. And I have become a bit more versed over the years on what is more appropriate for a given situation. So... If I can use that knowledge to make this easier on you, I'd like to."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was aware of this. Maybe not in so many words, but Rio understood it. She knew that Agatha was feeling responsible for the shock of it all that Rio seemed to be feeling, but it wasn't entirely her fault. They could have had those conversations before, sure, but this boiled down to little more than Rio's inability to shift her perception in a way that allowed her to comprehend the more nuanced facets of the life that Agatha had been living.
    </p>
<p>
     Naivety had consumed her, perhaps in a way that veered on the edge of dangerous, but Rio was not going to let herself slip. She had come so far and grown so much to not keep going and not keep growing. There were years ahead of her where there was more to learn and live through, but right then it simply involved the idea that she was going to need to do things that made her uncomfortable because it would make her wife's life easier. That was what love was, at its essence. It was doing what it took to support and care for someone despite any and all of life's challenges that were thrown in a long the way.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio pulled away only to shift so that she could press a soft kiss to the center of Agatha's forehead before shrinking down back against her side, eyes turning back toward the iPad.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, Vogue it is, then. I think," came Rio's soft announcement. She leaned in again, this time to bump her shoulder against Agatha's as she set to pulling up her Gmail. "Send Dave the email he's probably dying to get back from you and then what do you say we finish our orange juice and take a nap?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression puckered and her tongue rolled out, hanging in her mock gag. "Rio, that orange juice is
     <em>
      warm.
     </em>
     That's fucking gross."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Rio admonished, tutting her tongue at her in disapproval. "Sounds to me like you're just a wimp."
    </p>
<p>
     "Uhuh, no no," Agatha countered as she finished up the email and pressed send. "You are not going to goad me into drinking warm orange juice. That's not happening. I already feel sick."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio craned her neck, placing a peck to the side of Agatha's head. "Chicken," she teased just before she removed the contact and turned to reach over to her nightstand, pulling the glass to her so that she could toss back the few gulps left inside. As her went down and the aftertaste of the warmed and pulpy orange juice settled in every crevice of her mouth, the already agitated state of Rio's stomach started to revolt even more.
    </p>
<p>
     As her own mouth opened and her tongue fell out just slightly, her gag wasn't feigned. That warm liquid had dropped right to the bottom of her stomach like a boulder, leaving it unsettled and angry.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio?" Agatha asked, stowing the iPad on the nightstand before she turned back to Rio, clearly alarmed.
    </p>
<p>
     As she leaned in, Rio's hand raised to halt forward motion and her head shook a little as she fought herself on containing the nausea. It was a bit of a chore for several seconds, but with another forceful swallow of the saliva that had welled in her mouth, she seemed to steady herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay..." Rio forced, managing to swallow down that feeling one more time. "Maybe you were right. Warm orange juice is not the best."
    </p>
<p>
     "One day you'll learn I know what I'm talking about," Agatha pointed out, a playfully cocky air to her words. She leaned back into the pillows, scooting down the slightest bit so that she was in prime position for Rio to fit herself under the crook of her arm, in her spot.
    </p>
<p>
     With ease, Rio folded right into place as her head landed in its home on Agatha's chest. Agatha arm hooked around her shoulder, firm grip landing around the side of Rio's bicep, exposed from the sleep tank top she had put on, knowing that the likelihood of them leaving that day was slim to none.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio eyes slowly slid shut and she was too content with indulging in the nap she had suggested, but Agatha had other plans.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Can I ask you something?"
     </em>
     came her soft whisper as her hold lifted to no more than two fingertips, ones that began to pace light lines up and down rio's upper arm.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Always my love,"
     </em>
     Rio answered automatically.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "What are you thinking about all of this?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Despite how absolutely tanked her body felt as a result of their night of debauchery and how much she was looking forward to her nap, such a question seemed to wake her right up. Her eyes opened and focused on a spot on the far side of the room, right on a framed portrait of a puffin.
    </p>
<p>
     What was Rio thinking about all of it?
    </p>
<p>
     The only way she knew to answer was to be honest.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I... I don't really know right now,"
     </em>
     she admitted, breathing a soft sigh as she turned her face to nuzzle into Agatha's chest a little, as if she might find a better answer there. When she didn't, she tried her best to continue anyway.
     <em>
      "And maybe I won't until we get home, back to actual life. But... it all just is starting to make more sense. And... I have known who you are for some time now, and I knew the life you lived before I even put myself on that plane."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio paused, her hand raising to pinch a piece of Agatha's shirt between her thumb and forefinger, rubbing the cotton between it nervously. She closed her eyes, inhaling slowly before she released it, finally able to find her words again.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I guess it's just finally come time that I need to start understanding what what all actually means. I... I understood the TMZ pictures and everything, but... I guess I was just foolishly naive to not let myself recognize that it could, and likely would, get bigger than that."
     </em>
     As Rio stopped speaking, she tucked her bottom lip between her teeth, chewing softly out of nothing more than sheer nerves.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could bring herself to answer, Rio could almost swear she felt Agatha shrink beneath her. It was this fleeting thought, just a brief moment where she considered for a moment that Agatha was buckling at something life had thrown at her. Then, it was gone and Agatha's heart was beating just a little harder in her chest, an indication that what Rio had felt was not at all simply a figment of her imagination.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I know that... I did not do the best job at bracing you for this, and I truly am sorry for that. I just... I guess I thought we were going to have more time."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's sincerity was bleeding out of her, not just in the sound of her voice, but in the way her palm fastened to Rio's arm again, giving it a light squeeze as if the action might insist to Rio that she meant what she had said.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "My love, it really is okay,"
     </em>
     Rio assured her in a murmur.
     <em>
      "I'm going to figure it out. I just... might need some time. But I'll get there.
      <b>
       We
      </b>
      will get there."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "You're right, we will. But for now, we rest, hm?"
     </em>
     Agatha offered back, leaning enough to grace the crown of Rio's head with the lightest contact of her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mmhmm,"
     </em>
     she sounded in return, letting her eyes fall closed again. Those familiar sounds of Agatha's breathing and her heartbeat culminated in a symphony, one that was sure to put Rio out with relative ease.
    </p>
<p>
     If that had not been enough, the moment she shifted so that Agatha's hand was able to fall comfortably to her back and those light touches started, she was a complete goner.
    </p>
<p>
     Not entirely sure how long she had been asleep, Rio stirred and even before she opened her eyes, she sensed that the sun was no longer pouring in through the windows.
    </p>
<p>
     As her eyes fluttered open to behold the bedroom, she realized that she was right: it was very dark outside. What she noticed in the very next second was that the bed was devoid of any other occupant. Rio's forehead creased with her confusion and disappointment, her eyes lifting to the en suite, though the door was open and it was dark inside.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha?" Rio called, but she was met with little more than silence.
    </p>
<p>
     With a gentle push, Rio was upright. Immediately, she realized that she felt considerably better than she had before she had fallen asleep again, but she didn't quite feel tip-top. That was nothing more than a thought in the back of her mind as she tried to consider where Agatha might be.
    </p>
<p>
     It was possible she was in the kitchen, but it didn't smell like anything was being cooked. She could have simply been watching television downstairs as to not wake Rio from her nap, but the house felt too quiet for that to be true. After another moment of consideration, Rio slid out of bed and pulled a pair of flannel pajama bottoms over the shorts she had one. No other move was made to cover her bare arms and she departed the room, heading downstairs.
    </p>
<p>
     It was still too quiet, and it was dark. There weren't any lights on inside in the kitchen or living area.
    </p>
<p>
     There was one light on, though.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the one that illuminated the back patio, the one they had turned on when they'd gotten into the hot tub.
    </p>
<p>
     Why was the back patio light on?
    </p>
<p>
     And where the hell was Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     Despite finding no humor in waking up with no idea where idea her wife was, the moment Rio placed herself in front of the sliding glass door and looked to the left, every bit of annoyance and irritation she might have had evaporated just like that.
    </p>
<p>
     It had snowed. It had actually snowed quite a bit since the night before.
    </p>
<p>
     Outside, in her big black coat and her grey hat with the white pom on the top, Agatha was hoisting the smallest of three sizeable snowballs on top of the other two. It settled, but she still held her gloved hands out on either side of it, as if to catch it if the weight wasn't distributed correctly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was
     <em>
      building a snowman?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     They did not have coal, but it seemed to havd been of little consequence. That was even more apparent as Agatha took a step back and reached down, extracting the carrot she had planted there in the snow, a holster until she was ready to draw it. She seemed to survey her creation before she carefully pressed the carrot into the middle of head. Once secure, she used a padded thumb to press indents in for eyes to make due for their lack of suitable ocular replacements.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio watched her drag that thumb in a curve below the carrot, gracing her snowman with a large smile. When she was satisfied, Agatha took a step back and planted her hands on her hips, giving a confident and proud nod. Even though Rio could not see her face, she knew Agatha was wearing a shit-eating grin.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes never left Agatha as she reached for the door handle and pulled it open, placing herself in the doorway enough that she could lean outside to project her voice.
    </p>
<p>
     "What are you doing, my love?" Rio called warmly, the adoration deep in her words.
    </p>
<p>
     Startled, Agatha whipped around, looking like a child who had been caught with their hand inside of a cookie jar. Her head sank into her shoulders and her wide grin grew sheepish. She stepped back and angled her arms as if to display her work with pride.
    </p>
<p>
     "I made you a snowman!" she declared, beaming.
    </p>
<p>
     "Does he have a name?" Rio inquired loudly, though she wasn't quite shouting over the sound of the wind.
    </p>
<p>
     "No... I suppose he doesn't. What do you want to name him?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took this into heavy consideration for a brief moment, her face cinching in her focus as she racked her brain for something clever, something she knew would make Agatha laugh. Alas, she found it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Meltin' John!" she announced, her own pride winning out at how witty she was.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's face nearly cracked with her grin as her arms flew up to her middle, doubling over with her instant giggles.
    </p>
<p>
     "Meltin' John?!" she cried back through her howls of laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes. Now leave him out to freeze and come inside and let me make you soup!" Rio tried to bargain, though she knew she didn't have to try hard.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha straightened back up but her raucous joy had not desisted. Instead, she raised a gloved hand to wipe a tear off of her cheek before the wind could get to it. "Meltin'... John... Jesus Christ," she wheezed, fighting to calm herself down.
    </p>
<p>
     "Come inside! It's cold!"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grin remained steadfast, fixed to her face as though it were permanent.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you gonna warm me up?" It was suggestive, yes, but there was something a little closer to softness in her question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Always, my love."

      *****
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It had not taken long for things to go back to their regularly scheduled honeymoon programming, normal as ever...
    </p>
<p>
     Almost.
    </p>
<p>
     Galivanting around the city, seeing the sights, watching the Northern Lights, they had been immaculate experiences from top to bottom. Spending evenings at nice dinners, mornings cooking breakfast together, those moments had been everything in life Rio had needed them to be. Even nights in the hot tub or making out on the couch until they stumbled their way to bed were solidified as treasured memories, ones Rio could hold onto forever.
    </p>
<p>
     Then, there were other happenings, though they were immeasurably minute ones in the grand scheme of things. Still, they were ones that Rio couldn't help but get caught up on, mind spinning circles over them when she knew it truly was needless.
    </p>
<p>
     It was how at dinner one night, Agatha had this strange look in her eyes right before she accidentally knocked her wine glass off of the table, causing it to shatter on the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     Even more off-brand had been her reaction. She looked genuinely upset as she stared down at what she had done. It had lasted only a few seconds, but something about it had sounded like a whistle in Rio's head, a call for her attention. Before she could address it, it was gone and Agatha was righted where she sat, her hands back on the table and that calm, warm smile curving her lips like nothing had happened at all.
    </p>
<p>
     A member of staff had arrived to clean up the glass and while Agatha had apologized, no other trace of the incident seemed to remain with her. That was good; it had been an accident, but that look on her face was still clear as day like a photo in Rio's mind.
    </p>
<p>
     In another instance, Rio had been upstairs changing her clothes for their day out when she heard Agatha deliver a loud
     <em>
      FUCK!
     </em>
     from her place in the living room. When Rio had rushed to finish dressing herself and came bounding down the stairs to find the cause of the commotion, she saw Agatha calmly picking a magazine up off of the floor. She reached up to smooth her hair as she tossed it on the coffee table, clearly dissatisfied with whatever was inside it.
    </p>
<p>
     "My love, are you alright?" Rio had asked, cautious but still concerned as she approached the back of the couch, peering across it to where Agatha stood at the edge of the coffee table.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, just read something I vehemently disagree with, but it's nothing," Agatha returned, and while she
     <em>
      sounded
     </em>
     convincing, there was something more there. It was nervousness. It wasn't in her tone, but it was in her eyes and Rio could see it.
    </p>
<p>
     She almost asked. She was so close to asking Agatha what was on her mind, but before she could, Agatha was moving and insisting they head out and get their day started.
    </p>
<p>
     In all reality, they were the tiniest things. In Rio's reality, they were enough to know that something was going on inside of her wife's head that she was not willing or ready to talk about. Rio knew that it was perfectly normal to have thoughts and feelings like that, and to need time to figure out how to break them down. She knew what it was like to be caught up in the tides of too many things to consider and think about, but seeing it on Agatha struck her in an unfamiliar way.
    </p>
<p>
     What it came down to was that it hadn't started happening until after they had been informed of the leak. Everything before that had been typical for them, but even the smallest blips since had been noticeable. Maybe Rio had always been perceptive, but her perception when it came to Agatha seemed to be unparalleled.
    </p>
<p>
     If Agatha was not ready to discuss it, then Rio would wait until she was. It had to be that simple.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio roused that morning, the first thing she had noticed was just how tightly Agatha was holding onto her, wrapped around her from behind. It was so tight that she assumed Agatha was awake and aware of what she was doing. When she snored into Rio's hair, Rio realized she was still asleep and that Agatha's subconscious was the one holding on for dear life.
    </p>
<p>
     Something about it coupled with the fact that it was their last full day in Iceland sent an ache through Rio's chest. It wasn't that she was upset about leaving, it was just that it had been so,
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     nice to be separate from the world again. It was something Rio had been so used to doing for the majority of her life, but getting to do it with Agatha this time had been a new kind of peace Rio had never really known before.
    </p>
<p>
     But it, like all things, had to come to an end.
    </p>
<p>
     Due to prioritizing other things, such as hiking and dinner dates and drinks with Sædís and Elfa, they had pushed off smaller tasks that were not as significant and could be done should they make a return, which was already pinned to the 'things to do in the future' board.
    </p>
<p>
     One thing Agatha had been persistent about was going ice skating. She had mentioned it at least once a day, sometimes twice, and while Rio truly had tried to put up a decent argument as to why it was a terrible idea, she had known she was going to cave far before she actually did.
    </p>
<p>
     So, with the dawn of their last day seeping in through the haphazardly closed curtains, a day of plans to finally go ice skating lay ahead of them.
    </p>
<p>
     Waking up like that, clutched in Agatha's grasp, it made Rio not want to move an inch, let alone go out in public and make a complete fool of herself. Would it be embarrassing? Likely. Would she make Agatha's entire day by conceding and at least making some kind of effort? Also likely. It did feel like an appropriate thing to do with their time drawing to a close, something silly and fun, something they could lose themselves in for a few hours before the call of the real world sounded in their ears again.
    </p>
<p>
     Not wanting to break the sense of serenity, Rio had simply laid there like that in Agatha's hold for a little while longer, at least until Agatha stirred to consciousness.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mmm, is it morning?"
     </em>
     Agatha grumbled right before she nuzzled her face into the back of Rio's neck, exhaling a breathy and exhausted sigh.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It is. Probably around ten,"
     </em>
     Rio answered, bringing a hand to rest on Agatha's forearm which had loosened its hold in her awakened state.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha groaned behind her and shifted so that she could tuck her chin over Rio's shoulder, laying her head atop Rio's in an attempt to get as close as she could. Rio was immediately met with the smell of her shampoo, her hair landing in a way that tickled Rio's cheek. In the adjustment, Agatha had shifted so that her arm was hooked diagonally over Rio's torso, hand on her shoulder that was pressed to the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Let's just stay in bed,"
     </em>
     Rio suggested, though she was certain Agatha could
     <em>
      hear
     </em>
     the smirk she was wearing without having to bear witness to it herself.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You are not getting out of it, not a chance,"
     </em>
     Agatha murmured, tucking her head enough that her nose brushed against Rio's cheek.
     <em>
      "I have to get at least one picture of you on ice skates for the sake of our children. If I tell them I had the chance and didn't take it, they'll never let me live it down."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio exhaled in a sound that somehow melted in the middle between being a grunt and a whine, knowing that she would never hear the end of it herself if she wound up on her ass in the middle of a crowd of people who had likely been able to execute such a skill since they were toddlers.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You know I'm going to look like a dumbass, right?"
     </em>
     Rio whispered back, her fingers raking likely over Agatha's arm.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "No, you're going to look cute all bundled up trying to move around with baby deer legs while you figure it out. Which you will do. Because you can do anything,"
     </em>
     Agatha informed her. The deepness with which her voice sounded caused the tiniest vibrations against Rio's skull with the way they were laying, as if Agatha's honest were shaking its way through Rio's very bones.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Unshakable faith in me, have you?"
     </em>
     Rio posed, the softest and sweetest giggle rattling her for just a moment.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Always my love."
     </em>
     Agatha turned her head and pressed a kiss to Rio's temple, giving her the gentlest hug from behind.
     <em>
      "Now let's get showered and ready. We can have a quick breakfast and head out, hm?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Instead of providing an immediate response, Rio rolled in place so that as she settled, their skin touched almost everywhere. Breasts brushed and molded to press flatter, though Rio could feel very acutely where her nipples stiffened against Agatha's form in automatic response.
    </p>
<p>
     Their eyes met across the couple of inches of pillow between their heads and while Rio's lips twitched upward in some trace of a smile, there were the smallest hints of sadness and disappointment that could be found there.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm not ready to go home,"
     </em>
     she admitted bravely.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression shifted instantly from one of appreciation and reverence to one of empathy and understanding.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I know, because I don't know that I am either. But... we will handle it together, won't we?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was right. She was always right. She always knew the answers because she
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     let anyone else dictate her life.
    </p>
<p>
     So a mistake had been made, yes. Wyatt had royally fucked up and if Rio had any idea about him from the time she'd spent with and around him, she knew he was probably kicking himself for being so careless. Of course that didn't negate the fact that Agatha had every right to be pissed (and likely still was, even if only a little), but Rio truly was of the belief that he had not meant to cause any harm and it was something he had done in his intoxication and jovial mood.
    </p>
<p>
     It made things a little tougher to navigate, especially in their newness as a married couple, but they had encountered much worse in daytime restaurants and hotel lobbies, and they had gotten through it. If anything, Rio recognized that the reason this had gotten to Agatha so deeply was because it had caused the situation to slip out of her control. She no longer felt like she was at the helm of the ship of her own life and in turn, it unsettled her.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio had figured that much out, she didn't feel it explained those miniscule moments where Agatha seemed to step outside of herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Time, Rio told herself. All it would take was time.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe, she thought, there might be less of it than she had first assumed there might be.
    </p>
<p>
     They had lazed around a little longer in bed, just reveling in the warm skin and hazy morning moments while sleep was still leaving them. Eventually, Agatha had beguiled Rio to join her in the shower so that they could enjoy a new experience on their last day of their honeymoon. The way she had phrased it, practically cooing it into Rio's ear had been just enough to convince Rio to comply.
    </p>
<p>
     They showered in their typical fashion and for the first time in a few days, the tension that Agatha had been carrying around for days in her shoulders seemed to have dissipated for the most part. Gone was the impossible tightness that had been there, weighted with whatever it was that had been on Agatha's mind. Instead, it was pliable, easy for Rio to press and prod with her affection as she worked the soap in and the worries out.
    </p>
<p>
     Once cleaned and dried, they had dressed in layers and sweaters to prepare for the time they would be spending outside, though Agatha had made it a point to hip-bump Rio from in front of her own bag so she could rummage through to find one of the beanies Rio had bought that she could steal. When she had found a white one that had small ear flaps and black rope ties, she had placed it atop her head with a grin on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "See? I told you when you bought it that it would look better on me," she chimed, a child-like playfulness dancing in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's only because your head is bigger than mine," Rio teased back, poking a tongue out as Agatha quickly jabbed a crooked finger between Rio's ribs.
    </p>
<p>
     "I contain multitudes?" Agatha questioned back playfully before erupting with laughter at the absurdity of the question, though they both already knew it was a little too honest to actually be a joke.
    </p>
<p>
     They finished prepping and met the car outside, loading into the back wearing megawatt smiles and emitting the silliest giggles at their lighthearted and absurd conversations. They surely had to seem insane to the driver of the car as they carried on joking and laughing and simply existing in the last hours of their little corner of heaven. It was so easy to let go when it was just the two of them and while typically, Rio might have cared that there was an audience to their more tender moments, she couldn't have been bothered.
    </p>
<p>
     An end to their first two weeks as a married couple was on the next morning's horizon and while they had briefly discussed it that morning, Rio understood that there was a nervousness that stemmed from the unknown.
    </p>
<p>
     Truly knowing what it would be like upon their return home would be impossible until they were living it and experiencing it. Finding a way to gauge the reaction the world at large was going to have to a very famous, very prolific serial dater -- though Rio was well aware that what Agatha had been doing could most assuredly not be called 'dating' by any measure -- who was a prominent figurehead in Hollywood, getting secretly married after a mostly private nine month long relationship was actually toeing the edge of impossibility.
    </p>
<p>
     It was safe to say that there could be warm and appreciative reception, as they had gotten from their new friends, but Rio was not naive enough to think that there weren't going to be things said or that there wouldn't come a comment that really got to her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew that Agatha had been around this block many times, and she certainly could teach her how to handle it a little better or how to cope with it being a fact, but it left Rio feeling a little sad that it was something people with Agatha's status dealt with on a frequent basis. Now, Rio was realizing, it was something that would be prevalent in her day-to-day and the best answer for her would probably end up being to just not look at all, but for the time being, they still had a little longer before she even had to invest an adequate amount of thought into it.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, she was going to be giggly and a little nervous about trying something new with her wife as they drove through Reykjavik one last time.
    </p>
<p>
     In the time they had been there, Rio had found something new out about herself.
    </p>
<p>
     She quite liked the cold.
    </p>
<p>
     She was going to miss it.
    </p>
<p>
     She was going to miss the way it felt on her skin to step out on the back patio in the early morning with a hot cup of coffee in her palm. She was going to miss the pink shade it made Agatha's cheeks when they were enjoying an evening out. She was going to miss the way Agatha's nose stayed that same shade well after they came home.
    </p>
<p>
     Perhaps it could have been considered silly, but they were in the minutia of things Rio had not anticipated on experiencing, but had still wound up being some of her favorites.
    </p>
<p>
     As they climbed out of the car, Agatha's first action as always was to take Rio by the hand, nearly dragging her over to the little building -- rickety and old in its appearance -- where there was a wide opening and a pair of people helping customers and sliding rented pairs of ice skates across a counter top.
    </p>
<p>
     Well shit, Rio was really doing this.
    </p>
<p>
     She was quiet and observant as Agatha tended to the transaction, paying for the rentals and thanking the man who assisted her as he handed over both pairs. Rio stepped up to take hers, a bit shocked at how heavy they were, though she shouldn't have been considering they were literally steel blades bolted to shoes.
    </p>
<p>
     Studiously, Rio watched Agatha's every move as they sat on a bench and she worked to undo the skates so she could place them on her feet. Once that was accomplished, Rio was fixated on the fluidity with which Agatha laced them back up and secured them tightly enough that she was prepared to hit the ice. When she was done, her head lifted and cheeks already flush with the cold air, pushed up by her bright smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you think you can do it on your own?" she asked and while Rio could almost hear her laughter wanting to bubble out of her, she knew Agatha was being genuine.
    </p>
<p>
     "I watched every single thing you did and... Absolutely not. But..." Rio's gaze lifted and cut around them, surveying the groups of people throughout the makeshift rink. "I'm going to look like a child if I let you put ice skates on my feet."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grin was wide, but it was gentle and beguiling in its lightness. "Let me help you, please? I promise you that you will not be the first person to eat shit on this ice and you certainly will not be the last. But... I also promise that it'll be fun if you try. And to add," Agatha voiced, her eyes practically sparkling as she looked over at her wife, "I am not immune to busting my ass, either. It's just rare."
    </p>
<p>
     The stiffness in Rio's muscles melted a little as her hesitation waned the tiniest amount. "Are you saying you'll fall on your ass to make me feel better?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha leaned closer, placing a delicate but kind kiss to Rio's lips, that grin returning the moment she pulled back.
    </p>
<p>
     "There is nothing in this world I wouldn't do to make you feel better, my love," Agatha informed her in a voice that was just loud enough for only her to hear.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally resigning to their task, Rio had pulled her skates on and sat back, watching with interest as Agatha laced them up. She was so practiced, so methodical, like she had done this a hundred times before.
    </p>
<p>
     "How do you know so much about ice skating?" Rio questioned as Agatha finished up her right foot and moved to Rio's left.
    </p>
<p>
     "When you grow up in bumfuck Massachussetts and it's the dead of winter, you have to find
     <em>
      something
     </em>
     to do." Agatha shifted a little from her kneeling position, working her way through lacing up the other skate. "When I was thirteen, I saved up money from babysitting neighborhood kids to buy a pair of skates. Sometimes I'd bite myself carefully and tell the parents the kid did it so they'd give me a little more money."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha! You did not!" Rio gasped in her feigned shock, leaning forward a bit with a wide smile painted across her lips. In all actuality, Rio was not that surprised. That seemed like an entire power move that Agatha was capable of executing with ease, even as a teenager.
    </p>
<p>
     "One of the parents caught on after the third time. They found another babysitter." Even though it was a scam she'd committed nearly forty years earlier, the grin Agatha was wearing right then was still sheepish, like she knew she'd been doing something wrong the entire time but hadn't cared anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a tap to the side of Rio's calf and carefully lifted herself to her feet, balancing on the singular blades beneath her feet atop the rubber padding on the ground.
    </p>
<p>
     As a fact of the universe, she held her hand out.
    </p>
<p>
     As another fact of the universe, Rio took it despite the knowing that she was scared shitless about what was about to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     The sensation of even walking like that was a strange one as she stood and let Agatha cautiously guide her toward the edge of the ice.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay so," Agatha started before she took the plunge, "try to keep your head up. Knees bent as much as you can and the less you look at your feet, the better. You're going to kind of... Kick yourself off? If that makes sense?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was listening, and she was watching Agatha very intently as she delivered her instructions, but Rio had no clue what she was talking about. When Agatha realized that Rio was not quite able to picture it in her mind, she stepped back a bit so she was a little further from the ice but still clutching Rio's hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "Like this," she explained, carefully exhibiting the movement as she continued explaining. "When you use that momentum, the blades do the work and you take off. So just little pushes at first until you feel comfortable."
    </p>
<p>
     Simple science. Physics. That was light work... Right?
    </p>
<p>
     Wrong.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had spent ten minutes barely able to move a couple of inches. Agatha was a great coach and her encouragement was almost too sweet, but Rio quickly realized that being in possession of any sense of grace was not something she could manage. Instead, she had shuffled off to a far wall, clinging to it almost harder than Agatha had been clinging to
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     when she had woken up that morning.
    </p>
<p>
     "You go on, you do your thing," Rio encouraged, trying to replace the panic in her gaze with adoration for her wife who had been dragging her heels to try to keep up with her. Rio knew she wanted to cut loose, wanted to rely on a muscle memory that she had obtained when she was no more than a teenager.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you sure?" Agatha asked her back, her lips turning down slightly at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, my love, I am sure. I do not think I am quite cut out for ice sports. But I will happily watch you have fun."
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, let's at least get you off your feet first," she returned, holding her hand out so that they could slowly make their way back to the matting so that Rio could find that bench again and remove her skates.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had waited patiently for her to come back after she had returned the skates and gave her a sweet kiss, asking one more time if Rio was sure in her decision to sit by while Agatha had a little bit of fun.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, Agatha, I am sure. In fact, I'm looking forward to it. Now, go!" She leaned up, taking one more kiss from her wife before Agatha set off, taking to the ice with unreserved ease.
    </p>
<p>
     Sitting there, just watching as Agatha careened around that rink in her puffy coat and Rio's hat, Rio felt so filled to the brim with nothing but love. She loved the uninhibited smile Agatha had plastered to her face as she flew around the other people. She loved the way Agatha's hair was whipping around in the wind with her speed. She loved the laugh Agatha let out when she suddenly jerked sideways and skidded to a stop so that she could change direction.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio loved Agatha, but she loved seeing the smallest things that could make Agatha happy, too. It was very clearly something she had not done in a very long time, but it was something that could bring her an immeasurable amount of joy if only for that little bit of time.
    </p>
<p>
     There she'd stayed, just focused for close to a half an hour as Agatha glided around on the ice, looking so very in her element. It was those long winters, those dauntless hours of babysitting to make money, all of that culminating in a moment where Rio got to observe her wife in a state of utter contentment and reveling in the happiness of simplicity.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to settle a little, her pace slowing as she took one last lap around the rink before skating her way back toward the end that Rio was sitting at, and the overabundance of thrill she was feeling was visible as it plastered itself all over her expression.
    </p>
<p>
     "Fuck that felt good!" she exclaimed, drawing a pointed glare from a woman with her child a few feet away. Agatha glanced to the side and happened to catch sight of her, a hand flying to her mouth as she realized her mistake. "Whoops."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was in a full fit of laughter by the time Agatha scampered across the padding to place herself on the bench next to her, their thighs pressed together.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think that lady was ready to fight you, my love," Rio said, still trying to stave off the giggles she had fallen prey to.
    </p>
<p>
     "Eh, let her try. We know how that goes," Agatha offered back, a slightly daring edge to her words as she glanced over, tossing Rio a knowing smirk.
    </p>
<p>
     Chatting lightly back and forth, they decided what to do for supper that evening and also that they should forego any drinking with their impending flight the next day. They
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     tried to be a little more on the responsible side since those first few days, only indulging in maybe a glass of wine with a meal, or splitting a bottle on a night out, though it never usually got finished.
    </p>
<p>
     They had decided on swinging by the chip shop one last time and grabbed their meals before heading back to their home away from home in so, so many ways.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had turned on a Nat Geo documentary about the area while Agatha set up their dinner on the coffee table. It had been mostly quiet, the weighted understanding that they were approaching their last night falling asleep in a distant land landing over them somberly. It was exciting to truly start their lives as wives, but a lot of incredible memories had been made in two short weeks and knowing that there weren't more ahead of them had its own sense of melancholy to it.
    </p>
<p>
     After their meal, Rio had been the one to clean up, settling back on the couch but this time with her back against the arm and her legs draped over Agatha's lap. The arrangement left the junction where her thighs met her ass pressed to the side of Agatha's thigh, heels nestled into the cushion on the other side of her. Without a second's hesitation, Agatha's hands landed on Rio's warm skin, exposed by the shorts she had put on to relax in.
    </p>
<p>
     It was innocent enough, at least at first.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd been quiet, only making light commentary over the documentary, but it had taken only about fifteen minutes for Agatha to grow restless.
    </p>
<p>
     One of her palms lifted, breaking contact, but only for a moment before her fingertips began to glide up and down Rio's leg, over her knee and back up her thigh. In the moment, it felt nice and Rio was still focused on the documentary that was playing on the television across the room. As the minutes wore on, though, Agatha's restlessness seemed to increase.
    </p>
<p>
     For every inch the sun sank in the sky, the higher Agatha's hand climbed up Rio's thigh in its pacing. Rio shifted slightly, but she had miscalculated and had instead allowed enough space for Agatha's right hand to slide to the inside of her thigh. Almost mindlessly, Rio gave a light swat at the back of Agatha's wrist, but she didn't retract her touch.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm trying to watch this," Rio offered, and while she did mean it, she also knew that if Agatha persisted, she was not going to stop her. She wasn't even sure she could if she tried because she didn't actually
     <em>
      want
     </em>
     to.
    </p>
<p>
     At the end of the day, Agatha's inability to temper her attraction made Rio feel
     <em>
      good.
     </em>
     It made her feel like the most desired woman on the planet because of all the people to want her so much so often? The fact that it was
     <em>
      Agatha Harkness
     </em>
     would always be mind blowing, no matter the time or the day.
    </p>
<p>
     Every single day, Rio would remember that Agatha had picked
     <em>
      her.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     In moments like that one, she was also reminded that Agatha loved showing her as much whenever she could.
    </p>
<p>
     "So keep watching it," Agatha encouraged, her fingers kneading at the flesh of Rio's inner thigh, though she did not inch any higher at first.
    </p>
<p>
     Subconsciously, Rio licked her lips, suddenly torn between paying attention to the television but not being able to ignore the feeling of Agatha's hand between her legs. Agatha knew what she was doing, as always, and Rio was starting to feel the heat of the interaction as it inched up her spine.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes were trained, fixed on the TV, but Agatha started moving again. Her left hand hooked over Rio's thigh and gave a slight tug, pulling it toward her own abdomen. It allowed for the already positioned hand to slide higher, fingers deftly and expertly working around the fabric of Rio's shorts and only her shorts, having resigned the rest of her night to staying in the house with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The very second Agatha's fingertips brushed over Rio's warm and damp flesh, Rio's eyes rolled back and a choked moan was caught and trapped behind her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha..."
     </em>
     she muttered, forcing her eyes open again to try and retrain her focus. It lasted all of two seconds until she felt Agatha's touch sink deeper, pressing between her folds to barely grace over Rio's clit with her fingertips before dropping lower, sliding through the slick that had pooled there.
    </p>
<p>
     "Keep watching. This part looks really interesting," Agatha coaxed lowly, though the moment she finished speaking, Rio felt it everywhere as Agatha pressed a couple of digits inside of her. The immediate sensation drew an uncontainable gasp, Rio's hand flying to land on the side of Agatha's shoulder, squeezing tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was shifting almost instantly, her hips working just barely against the feeling of Agatha's touch inside of her, suddenly entirely disinterested in the documentary. Who gave a shit about puffins when Agatha was working those fingers with finesse, touching what parts of Rio she could reach with where she was situated?
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "A-Agatha... I -- Fuck!"
     </em>
     Rio panted, her fingertips sinking deeper into Agatha's arm, hips growing more restless.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you see that puffin dive like that?" Agatha asked coolly, though Rio could hear in the middle of her question as her breath hitched just barely.
    </p>
<p>
     Try as she might, Rio no longer gave a single fuck about the television. Instead, her head tipped back, chin toward the ceiling as Agatha's pace pumping in and out of her body grew a little more hurried. A low moan rumbled out of her, hips shifting and lifting to try and accommodate as much of Agatha's touch as she could manage.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're missing the --" Agatha had started, but the loud moan Rio produced at a well timed crook of Agatha's fingers inside tight flesh drowned her out completely.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Again! Againagainagainagain!"
     </em>
     Rio pleaded in a whimper of the highest pitch she was capable of managing.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha knew exactly what Rio was asking of her and she listened, adjusting slightly so that she could achieve the same action, repeating it a couple more times as Rio began to tense up where she sat.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Yes! Yes yes yes!"
     </em>
     Rio yelped, that feeling of ultimate pleasure beginning to roll down into her belly to only drop lower.
    </p>
<p>
     Simply by the way her body was reacting, Agatha knew how close Rio was. She only proved that much by dropping the hand that wasn't working Rio to satisfaction so that those fingertips could slide into Rio's shorts to assist her as they applied light and consistent pressure to Rio's clit.
    </p>
<p>
     It took only a series of seconds for it to completely be Rio's physical undoing. Her fingers were digging so roughly into Agatha's arms as her body clenched and the released, her pleasured wails and cries sounding everywhere around them as the orgasm Agatha had been determined to give her completely pulled her under.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mmm,"
     </em>
     Agatha hummed, clearly pleased with herself as her motions slowed and her fingers were removed completely, leaving Rio panting with her neck nearly entirely extended back, the lowest and rockiest whine slipping from between her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "F-fuck, Agatha,"
     </em>
     she breathed, her grip finally releasing from the deathlike hold it had been maintaining.
     <em>
      "Where the fuck did that come from?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's fingertips resumed their taunting lines atop Rio's thigh, though this time they were wet and sticky with Rio's come.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's our last night here. And I've been behaving the majority of the night. But... I can't stop thinking about how much I want you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     There was a huskiness in that tone of voice Agatha chose, one that felt hard for Rio to ignore, even if Agatha wouldn't have just fingered her then and there on the couch. While she contemplated her response, her hand lifted and slid into Agatha's hair, fingers raking through it gently.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "And how do you want me, my love?"
     </em>
     Rio asked, those bright green eyes dropped to Agatha's shockingly sparking blue ones as she finally found the gumption to lift her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha took only a moment to consider before her hand flattened to canvas the top of Rio's thigh.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "On your back with me above you. And I get to use the strap this time."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Oh.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Oh.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      Ohhhh.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Shit. Okay.
    </p>
<p>
     This was a rare request for Agatha, and Rio knew why. It wasn't something they did with frequency, but that was solely because Agatha cared enough about Rio's comfort and mental well being that it wasn't of utter importance to her. Typically, when they
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     stumble into that territory, Rio was almost always on top for her own sense of control over such a situation.
    </p>
<p>
     However, it seemed as though this time, Agatha wanted things to be a little different.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You brought it with you and bring it up on the very last night?"
     </em>
     Rio asked, unable to curb the way her lips curled in both adoration and want.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha shrugged, giving Rio's thigh another light squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Didn't really need to before, did I? But tonight... I want to be that close to you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's lips lifted at the corners, a realization dawning over her.
     <em>
      "You want to make love to me?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The nod that Agatha gave was almost imperceptible, but her the emotion in her eyes was earnest and the encouraging prod of her fingertips seemed to solidify such a desire.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha never asked for something she didn't want, or without reason. The way she was asking, that look in her eyes? She was trying to be nonchalant, but it struck something in Rio, offered the faintest whisper in the back of her mind that she should finally say something about those otherwise irrelevantly tiny moments.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's actions were clearly a diversion from whatever it was that had been plaguing her, but Rio was wondering if she were reaching the point where it became less about letting Agatha have the time she needed and more about stepping into her duty as Agatha's wife.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio sat up a little, lifting a hand so that she could curl a finger beneath Agatha's chin, a silent request for a kiss that Agatha offered not a second later. When their lips separated, Rio was quick to move, pressing a kiss to the corner of Agatha's mouth.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Why don't we go upstairs, baby?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The inquiry was double-sided; yes, it would progress this to the bedroom and that was all and well, but it was also a stalling tactic. It was a way for Rio to work out in her head how to handle a new situation; Agatha had yet to shut her out, but whatever this was... It was beginning to feel like being shut out.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha took one last kiss, Rio could feel it in her chest, in the way her heart began to thud a little. It was Agatha's love, but something about it left the faintest taste of doubt lingering on the tip of Rio's tongue.
    </p>
<p>
     Pushing that aside, Rio began the process of removing herself from Agatha's lap so that they could migrate up the stairs, fingers woven together in a clasp that allowed for no separation.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel that weight in the air; it was the culmination of the end of their time in Iceland, just how much they loved one another, and whatever it was that was turning Agatha's mind more often than not.
    </p>
<p>
     They crossed into the bedroom and Rio headed toward the bed, but Agatha planted her feet and gently gave a tug on Rio's hand, pulling her back so that they were facing one another, only a several inches or so away from the foot end of the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     There was such a softness, a caution almost, as Agatha leaned forward, placing the lightest kiss to the center of Rio's forehead and then between her eyebrows. Her kisses continued, gracing a couple more places along Rio's hairline as her fingers wound into the fabric of the t-shirt Rio had put on once they had come home.
    </p>
<p>
     Those kisses across Rio's face didn't stop until Agatha lifted up on her shirt, pulling it over her head to reveal a bare torso that had been prepared for this inevitability. She leaned in to continue the dusting of her lips across Rio's face, but she was stopped by the feeling of Rio's palm pressing flatly to her chest, keeping her from progressing forward.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes opened and immediately fell into Rio's own and what Rio saw there was her answer as to what it was she needed to do next. Those beautiful blue eyes that Rio could drown in every day of her life looked like an angry storm in the depths of night.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Hey,"
     </em>
     she whispered, her hand sliding up Agatha's chest and neck so that she could cradle her jaw lovingly. She could see that Agatha knew what was coming, and she could also see that Agatha wanted to bolt.
     <em>
      "I've been trying to not ask, because I know that
      <b>
       you
      </b>
      know if something's bothering you, we can talk about it. But... Are you okay, my love?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     That storm in those eyes began to churn, flashing with whips of lightning and darkening with the sudden realization that Agatha was not going to avoid whatever it was this time.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead of turning away, instead of trying to sweep it under the rug, Agatha brought her own hand up to cup Rio's cheek, meeting her evenly. For the most painful few seconds, she did not say anything, simply stared right into Rio's soul, perhaps looking for the solace she needed. Instead of finding a verbal response right away, Agatha leaned forward and pressed their lips togther.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the fact that they were seconds away from tangling in one another, there was something different about that kiss. It was not afraid or timid, but there was an urgency there, maybe even a panic.
    </p>
<p>
     What could be eating away at Agatha so badly that she kissed Rio like she thought she might never get to again?
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I will be okay when we talk about it later,
     </em>
     " Agatha whispered against the corner of Rio's mouth, placing a timid kiss there.
     <em>
      "But right now, I just really need all of you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     While this wasn't quite the satisfactory answer Rio might have been hoping for, she could hear the desperation in those words, in those hushed tones. Something about it was enough to give her at least an additional moment of pause.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha --"
     </em>
     she began, but Agatha was quick to stop her, bringing her other hand up to hold Rio's face in her grasp.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I need you in the way that I need courage. So... Please... Let me have you."
     </em>
     She leaned forward and resumed her earlier work of placing kisses to Rio's face, but this time she whispered against her warm flesh as she did so.
     <em>
      "Just let me have you. Then we'll talk. I promise."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Maybe Rio should have been torn. Maybe she should have slammed on the brakes and brought this to a hault, but what Agatha had just said?
     <em>
      I need you in the way I need courage.
     </em>
     It was reverberating in the hollows of every single bone in Rio's body. Agatha was telling Rio that she had what Agatha needed, and that right then, it was about more than just sex and what it meant typically to tangle like that. Everything Agatha was asking for was everything she needed to find her bearings and do the things that she wasn't ready to do.
    </p>
<p>
     All Rio needed to do was provide. That was something she could, and would always, do for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha moved about, depositing kisses everywhere she could reach on Rio's face, Rio leaned back enough that she could locate where Agatha's lips were before her and closed the space again by kissing them.
    </p>
<p>
     Their lips melded and folded and broke apart and rejoined as Rio took to the task of undressing Agatha before her own shorts were the last article of clothing to hit the floor.
    </p>
<p>
     Both of Rio's hands raised, cradling Agatha's face between them as Rio stepped closer, their fronts pressing together as Rio kissed her wife with every single ounce of love and compassion she felt herself capable of. It was a warm kiss, at first, but grew hot the more Agatha seemed to realize that Rio was not going to offer further protest in relation to the emotionally unexplored facet of what was happening.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft smack hit the air as Rio separated their mouths but was quick to kiss Agatha's cheek, her jaw. Willingly, she even placed a soft kiss to the spot on her neck, just below her ear, on the unmarked side before she kissed the lobe and whispered softly against it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Get ready, my love,"
     </em>
     she crooned, playfully nipping at the edge of the flesh there, releasing after a light tug.
    </p>
<p>
     The coolness of the room was felt everywhere as Rio stepped back, no longer warmed by the cradle of Agatha's skin. She turned toward the bed and paced to her side, turning down the comforter before she climbed in, no hesitation to be found as she placed herself toward the center. Her eyes lifted, watching Agatha as she moved from her bag to the nightstand, that purple double ended dildo clutched in her thin fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     For Rio, there was something so impossibly sexy about watching Agatha as she ran through these motions. She knew Agatha felt the same way when things were reversed, but it always left Rio practically dripping as she beheld the act of Agatha securing the strapless appendage inside of herself. It always got a thousand degrees hotter when Agatha would take the time to palm a bit of lube, stroking in a way that pushed and tugged at her own walls, making her head tip back and her tongue snake out to wet her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Once she was ready, that bright blue gaze pinned Rio on the bed and Agatha was moving, climbing onto the mattress and then over her wife, holding herself up with planted hands above each of Rio's shoulders. Her hair hung wild and loose over her shoulders, a few stray strands tickling the side of Rio's face, but it wasn't enough to distract her from the way Agatha was looking down at her, or the way she was looking right back up at her wife.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you, Rio,"
     </em>
     Agatha whispered to her, dropping her head.
    </p>
<p>
     Before their lips met in the kiss Agatha sought, Rio had something she needed to be heard, too.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you the most, Agatha."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     For the millionth time since she had met Agatha, Rio was swept out into the sea of their love as Agatha kissed her. It was a slower progressing than normal, but by the time their tongues had met, Agatha was moving to arrange Rio's body in a manner that would accommodate what it was she was seeking.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let Agatha adjust her, pushing her right knee up and out while gingerly adjusting the left leg, though not so drastically. Once Agatha had achieved what she had been aiming for, she broke their kiss and shifted again so that she could divert her attention to what it was she needed to do to progress the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     The softest gasp leapt from Rio's lips as she felt the immediate stretch as Agatha pressed inside her, that full and familiar feeling nearly taking her over. In nothing more than mindless movement, Rio's hands had flown to Agatha's back, fingertips and nails sinking into the lean muscle there. The moment they were both comfortable, Agatha settled a little more, letting her weight sink down into Rio's body.
    </p>
<p>
     With her closeness came Rio's inability to not wrap her up entirely. Those tan and strong arms wrapped around Agatha's back, though one immediately began to trek upward so that her fingers could tangle in Agahta's wild mane.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's movements were so measured, so thoughtful as her hips began to rock, reaching deeper and deeper into Rio with each intentional thrust. It was not desperate or panicked or frenzied in any way, especially not with how Agatha's head had turned to place kisses to Rio's jaw, her neck, and her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     Each kiss elicited a soft sigh or quiet whimper from Rio's parted lips, but when Agatha's face pressed into the side of her neck, a switch in Rio's brain flipped.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha needed courage.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could give her courage if by doing nothing more than being supportive.
    </p>
<p>
     She had let those sounds of desire fuel Agatha for those first few moments, but it wasn't enough. It wasn't what Agatha needed right then. Rio's hand traveled a bit higher through Agatha's hair and her head turned just enough that she was a little closer to Agatha's ear.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Y-yes, my love. Like that,"
     </em>
     she breathed in encouragement, the hand on Agatha's back moving to her shoulder blade, fingers gripping and clawing in her affectionate desire. She felt Agatha's hand as it moved to her knee that was pulled up and pushed it a little further out, careful not to hurt Rio, but also enabling her to get even closer.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead of any remotely vocal response from Agatha, Rio felt her lips latch onto the side of her neck, kissing and sucking softly in a way that kicked off another handful of neurons in Rio's brain.
    </p>
<p>
     Her pace never hiccuped or slowed and Rio was eating up every last minute of it. This was Agatha,
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     Agatha, finding solace in their love and their connection, both physical and emotional, and it made Rio feel more loved than it likely should have. It was okay for her that Agatha needed something more out of this than just a physical release. In fact, it thrilled her because it meant that she truly could be
     <em>
      everything
     </em>
     Agatha needed, even if asking for it was not always easy.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Gods, you feel so good,"
     </em>
     Rio whimpered, her head turning a bit more so that her nose slipped between strands of mussed and ruffled hair, lavender and vanilla engulfing her sense of smell.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Fuck, Rio,"
     </em>
     Agatha grunted through her effort, her words hot and damp against the crook of Rio's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     The reaction that came was nothing more than a tightening of Rio's hold around Agatha's back, her bent leg shifting enough to hook over Agatha's hip and ass, allowing her the tiniest bit closer. The inclination to hold her tighter, to keep her closer, to feel as Agatha melted into her and they finally became one was so strong, something Rio no longer cared enough to try and fight.
    </p>
<p>
     Intimacy had never been something that was lacking between the two of them, but in those moments with their bodies tangled and Rio clinging to Agatha like she wouldn't ever settle if she let her go, it was close to the most intimate they had ever been with one another.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the gentle pressure Agatha kept steady with her rhythm, it was the light kisses she would press to Rio's neck when she could remember to do so. It was the soft sighs she breathed there, almost in time with Rio's quiet gasps and whines. It was her reactions to the things Rio was saying to her, especially the
     <em>
      keep going, baby
     </em>
     that Rio had dumped into her tangle of hair.
    </p>
<p>
     The amount of time that passed could have been seconds or it could have been hours, but Rio wouldn't have been able to guess. All she knew was that she was lost in everything Agatha was and everything she wanted to be for Agatha in those moments. Physically, though, her body was beginning to give her away.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "A-Are you... baby, are you cl-close?"
     </em>
     Rio managed in a breathless pant, her fingers gripping a little tighter in Agatha's hair on one hand and digging deeper into muscle with the other.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Y-Yeah,"
     </em>
     Agatha nearly gasped back, but when she increased her pace to accentuate her answer, Rio's heel pressed into the soft flesh of her ass, a warning before she could find her words.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Go a little -- oh! -- a little sssslower, until you're there,"
     </em>
     Rio coached in a soft rasping and Agatha immediately understood the direction. However, it seemed to only be needed for a grand total of five seconds. Rio could tell before Agatha even resumed her pace that what she had just said had kicked her a little closer to that edge by the way her breath caught and then forcefully rippled over her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was grabbing at her with the hand that wasn't braced on the bed, fingers gripping and pulling and wanting as they traveled, unsettled by the build up that was likely happening in her middle. Her face sank into Rio's neck in her fervor, a request she knew Rio would grant falling from her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Come with me, Rio,"
     </em>
     she voiced, so pitched and needy in her begging.
    </p>
<p>
     It was all Rio needed to hear to seal the deal.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I -- ohhhhh, Agathaaa -- I'm gonna come,"
     </em>
     she forced out, knowing she was done for. That only became obvious as Agatha thrust her hips forward one last time and not only was it enough for Rio's orgasm to spill into her nerves, but she could feel as Agatha's body immediately began to tremble atop her.
    </p>
<p>
     They were a harmonious ringing of moans and whimpers and whines and cries, needy and desperate in their love and devotion. Rio simply clung to her wife, arms and legs secured tightly where they were wrapped, holding her through their concurring orgasm.
    </p>
<p>
     Even as the waves ebbed out a few moments later, neither of them moved. Agatha remained completely still other than the gentle heaving of her chest, her breath still hot on Rio's neck and her weight like a comfort atop her body. Being that close to Agatha, it hadn't exactly been foreign, but that heightened sense of intimacy was still new. Rio was not quite at a point, though, where she was ready to question it.
    </p>
<p>
     In fact, when Agatha finally found some form of an ability to move, Rio did not want her to. The moment Agatha lifted her head, both of Rio's legs snapped and locked around Agatha's waist, encouraging her to stay where she was.
    </p>
<p>
     Confused, those big blue eyes looked down to her and Rio simply met her with an enticingly gentle smile.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Look at me this time,"
     </em>
     she requested, lifting herself enough to catch Agatha's lips in another kiss that showed initiative.
    </p>
<p>
     Once more, it was slow, it was patient, it was filled with the infinite love the two of them held so easily for one another. They had surely fucked wild throughout the course of their relationship, but both of those exchanges were nothing that could even be resembled as such. Rio had phrased it the best when she had realized what Agatha had been asking for.
    </p>
<p>
     Those two instances were a pure showing of love, of affection, of appreciation.
    </p>
<p>
     Loving Agatha had never been so easy. Would Agatha ever realize that?
    </p>
<p>
     By the end of the second round, Agatha finally found it within her to pull away once Rio had released the lock around her waist, and rolled to her back next to her wife, both of them panting in the relief of their effort.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's eyes had fallen closed in her bliss, but her hand had blindly sought out Agatha's on the bed between them, fingers wrapping tightly around her lifeline, the one thing that would always keep her grounded. It was all she felt she could say, right then. She felt like she had transcended, like what they had just shared had elevated her to an entirely new plane of existence. For every other time she had considered it, there was something right then that struck Rio in her core.
    </p>
<p>
     She had ascended.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was Agatha's true goddess, her salvation. Rio was relief, understanding, acceptance.
    </p>
<p>
     For Agatha, Rio was the only thing she truly needed to believe in.
    </p>
<p>
     Even if that
     <em>
      feeling
     </em>
     wasn't enough, Rio was affirmed in the realization the very next moment Agatha whispered from her place on her back beside her wife.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'm ready to talk."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     This was a good thing, yes, but truthfully, Rio knew that she was not in a clear enough state of mind to be offering advice. With this in mind, Rio rolled to her side and placed her hand to Agatha's stomach, turning her face in to kiss at her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Why don't we take a shower first? And then, when we're a little more grounded, I'll be ready to listen."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's brows were hiked from where she was simply so that she could take in Agatha's expression from beneath her lashes. Her bright eyes were fixated, studying, watching as Agatha took in the request and let it settle, perhaps even realizing it for what it was.
    </p>
<p>
     When she agreed, she realized exactly what it was.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a way for Rio to return that sentiment of intimacy, a way for her to take every single second she could to caress and wash her wife's skin. She wasn't just removing the sweat that came from their pleasure, or even the one that had come from their outdoor efforts earlier in the day. Rio wasn't just washing away the specks of dirt that landed there, she was showing Agatha that once clean, she could maintain that newness by honoring her intention to speak about what it was that seemed to be gnawing at her from the inside out.
    </p>
<p>
     Even as Rio let Agatha return the gesture, she could feel in her touch that while she was nervous, she knew the truth. She knew that whatever it was she had to say, it didn't really matter. It did in the vein that it was obviously something that was bothering her, but it wasn't going to change anything Rio said or did or felt.
    </p>
<p>
     Again, and again, and again, Rio loved Agatha. Outside of betrayal or intentional injury, that was something that was
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     going to change.
    </p>
<p>
     They dried off and returned to the bedroom, but Rio stopped near Agatha's side of the bed, turning to face her. She glanced over her shoulder at the bed, then back up to Agatha, her lips worrying for just a moment before she spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "How would you like to have this conversation?" Rio asked her, tones low and buffered. It was clear that Rio understood just how wrought with anxious energy Agatha was over this piece of information she had been clinging to, and so Rio wanted her to be comfortable when she found her bravery to will it out into the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's gaze flickered toward the bed as she debated, her own lips pressing into a thin line as she seemed to find her way to a decision.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can you... Can you sit against the headboard?" Agatha asked, her voice unusually small.
    </p>
<p>
     This was normal, Rio told herself. Agatha was clearly nervous, if not maybe even afraid. Rio stepped forward to kiss her but then obliged, placing herself more toward Agatha's side against the pillows. In the next moment, Agatha was moving, gently pushing Rio's knees apart so that she could place herself between them, her back finding itself flush with the front of Rio's body.
    </p>
<p>
     Fluidly and instantaneously, Rio's arms wrapped around Agatha's middle and her chin tucked over her shoulder. Her hold was firm, supportive, encouraging. Agatha knew Rio loved her, but right then what she needed was to
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     it. They sat like that, just quiet as Agatha tried to build herself up and as Rio waited with her eternal well of patience until Agatha pulled in a slow and full breath, exhaling it so that she could speak.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I... I have never actively kept things from you, or lied about anything. But... There are parts of my life that I don't put an effort in trying to consciously remember, too. And because of that, they don't get brought up."
     </em>
     Rio was listening to every catch, every shift in Agatha's tone as she spoke, her voice almost solemn in its delivery.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha, you know I don't care about --"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand found Rio's arm where it was locked around her middle and gave an urgent squeeze, willing her to silence.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Please. Let me talk."
     </em>
     She turned her head slightly, cheek brushing against the side of Rio's face.
     <em>
      "I made a lot of poor choices in my life, and a good deal of them you know about. But, when I was married for those ten years of anger and self loathing, there were things I did... Things that I, quite frankly, hate myself for. And while I have never feared that they could come back to hurt me, I have reconsidered that with the public response to the leaked photos."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Her grip was still strong on Rio's arm, but Rio did not move a muscle. She was steadfast, anchoring herself to her wife with that embrace that she was not going to release for anything. What Agatha was saying, and how she was saying it, they were making Rio realize that this was something far heavier than she had initially surmised. Agatha had been carrying things around with her that were simply buried; the weight of them still pulled her down, she just had not conscious explanation as to why.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Rio, I..."
     </em>
     Agatha stopped herself, sucking in a sharp breath as she appeared to have lost her resolve for just a moment.
     <em>
      "I know that my moral compass has always been questionable... But, one thing I have never believed in is infidelity. Even though I was unhappy, even though I was miserable, I had an appearance to keep up and a son to raise, though I suppose 'raise' is a loose term in hindsight."
     </em>
     This time, when Agatha stopped speaking, Rio could actually hear her swallow down the nerves that were knotted in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I never touched anyone else the entire time I was publically married to him. I would not cheat. But... Maybe what I chose to do was worse."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could feel beneath her grasp as tension seemed to seep into Agatha, her muscles firming in her hesitance to keep going. She wanted to speak, to assure Agatha that nothing she was about to say was going to change anything between them, but Agatha had asked that she just listen, so she did, showing her support through a soft squeeze around Agatha's middle.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You... You're going to be so ashamed of me,"
     </em>
     Agatha admitted, the guilt and anguish so clear over every word she said.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "My love,"
     </em>
     Rio admonished, breaking her resolve on letting Agatha carry on uninhibited. She tutted her tongue softly, grip tightening.
     <em>
      "We have never before dictated one another's emotions and we are not going to start now. So... Why don't you tell me so you can finally let it go?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's body shook slightly with the shuddering breath she sucked in, but she seemed to find her courage.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I would go into bars on the fiftieth floors of swanky buildings and I would pay women to let me go home with them, to let me watch them. I needed
      <b>
       some
      </b>
      kind of relief from the self-inflicted misery I was drowning in and so I was reckless and foolish. My son hated me for so long because of what happened in the ten years after the divorce, but if he knew about the ten years before, he would just never forgive me."
     </em>
     The way Agatha sounded so fucking broken, so upset, it was pulling at the very depths of Rio's heart, twisting and bending in the most painful ways.
     <em>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "And I... I know it was wrong, I know it. But I did it, and now... Now, if someone from twenty years ago tries to step forward with such an allegation... They wouldn't be lying, and
      <b>
       I
      </b>
      needed to be the one you heard it from.
      <b>
       I
      </b>
      needed to tell you so that any decision to be made could be yours."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Every single word Agatha spoke was soaking in her shame, dripping in the embarrassment of actions she had chosen two decades ago. She had been younger, she had been trapped and in a consistent state of duress that, while had been a product of her decision, had not been any less valid.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the last thing she said that pulled a reaction from Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Her arms wrapped tighter around Agatha, securing her there firmly as she turned her head and placed a kiss to Agatha's damp hair.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "The only decision to be made here, my love, is that you are my wife and I love you."
     </em>
     She was quiet for a moment, nuzzling a little more into the side of Agatha's head, debating her next words.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I understand it, I do,"
     </em>
     she affirmed in the softest whisper,
     <em>
      "I get that you think that you're going to unearth something from another life, that Another Agatha chose to do because of her situation and that it's going to scare me."
     </em>
     Rio took a breath and then placed another kiss to Agatha's head.
     <em>
      "But I've already told you what scares me, Agatha, and it's a life without you in it."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     There were roughly thirty seconds of dead air, dead space, just silence that was void of motion.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, Rio immediately felt in every inch of her arms and chest as Agatha's body began to tremble as she started to cry.
    </p>
<p>
     Shit. That wasn't the goal. Making the woman who hardly ever cried break down in tears had not been Rio's intent, but it made sense. This was something that had been bothering Agatha for weeks, something she had kept so close to the vest because she had clearly been worried that it was going to be some kind of deal-breaker, but it simply made Rio realize that they were both figuring out just how deep their wells of love ran for one another.
    </p>
<p>
     Jumping into action, Rio loosened the hold her arms had been maintaining and placed her hands on Agatha's shoulders, silently requesting movement that Agatha quickly succumbed to, letting Rio lean back and pull her into her chest as she wept.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing Agatha dissolve into tears in such a way was something Rio had never really thought about experiencing. Agatha was always so stoic and while Rio
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     seen her cry before, it was never like this. Agatha's version of crying was six tears max and a pink nose. Right then, she was bordering on the edge of breaking into sobs as Rio cradled the side of her head that was not pressed to the skin of her chest.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Let it go, my love. Get it out. It's okay."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She sat that way, rocking gently with Agatha secured in her arms, crying enough that Rio's chest was considerably wet with her tears. Minutes wore on but Rio did not try to rush the moment along. Agatha could take every single second that she needed to find herself again and Rio would be right there, holding on until she did so.
    </p>
<p>
     Eventually, the soft weeping tapered off and the trembling of Agatha's form greatly decreased as she seemed to find a semblance of calm, a way to center herself again. When her chest finally returned to a normal pace, Rio was not quite ready to leave it where it was.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Can you tell me what that was brought on by?"
     </em>
     Rio asked her, smoothing Agatha's hair with tender fingertips. She needed to know so that she could form a response, so that she could attempt to devise some kind of plan to quell those feelings, the ones that caused Agatha to fold to a show of emotion that even in the comfort of her wife's presence, she had never let go of before.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's the last one. The last thing I thought that might make you leave."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Such an admission broke something in Rio, but she did let it touch an inch of her exterior. What she chose to do instead was turn her head so that she could place a firm and loving kiss to the top of Agatha's head.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Well then, that settles it,"
     </em>
     she murmured into the hair against her lips,
     <em>
      "I suppose it's a really good thing I committed to death til us part, hm?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha did not speak again, just remained there folded against Rio's chest, her palm flat over the space directly above where Rio's heart was located. Her sniffles still sounded every few minutes, and by the second one, Rio had lifted her hand to lay atop Agatha's. Those fingers played gingerly with the wedding ring on Agatha's finger, showing it the attention it deserved there right before Agatha's very eyes until she could no longer keep them open. The fingers on her other hand never desisted in their motions through that damp tangle, soothing in their ministrations.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had almost been convinced that Agatha had fallen asleep, but was startled by the realization she was not when she murmured a soft deliverance into Rio's chest.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I will always love you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio craned her neck forward so that she could finagle a way to kiss Agatha's forehead, her own whispered sentiment so impossibly sincered as it was breathed there, as if Rio hoped it might sink in a little easier that way.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you forever."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The way Agatha's hand shifted so it could hold onto Rio's fingers told Rio that Agatha heard her,
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     heard her, and that she understood it, too. When that grip slackened only a few minutes later, Rio realized that Agatha had finally exhausted herself to sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Knowing that she was the only one left conscious, it all finally settled.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had made her own choices, ones that weren't healthy. She had shut out the world, locked herself away and kept herself and her daughter protected from the cruelty of the world for as long as she could. She had isolated herself to prevent the unpredictable from sinking her. She found her peace in her solitude, found a true ability to flourish through the act of being alone. She had chosen to close herself off because she could, because no one was watching her enough to care.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, on the other hand, had never not been watched. People were always looking at her, always waiting for her to make her next move. Even before her fame, she had been under the scrutiny of her mother's angry and contemptuous gaze. All Agatha had done was jump from one spotlight to another, even if it hadn't actually been her intention in regard to the ramifications that came with those decisions.
    </p>
<p>
     She had felt so trapped in the choices she'd been convinced she
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     to make that she'd furthered the problem by making more choices that fell into a very grey moral area. She had sought out relief in desperation and instead, carried shame over it nearly twenty years later. She shut the world out, only allowing for physical connection, and she lived up to her moniker of being a Witch because that was how she had needed the world to see her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha would always be the Wild Witch in the public eye, and that was something Rio actually had a fondness for, but it was because she knew who Agatha
     <em>
      really
     </em>
     was beneath the ambition, the drive, and the trauma.
    </p>
<p>
     As the tears began to roll down her cheeks, Rio realized perhaps the most important fact in all of this pain and ache and shame.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha told her, even with her fears, because she needed Rio to finally know her fully and wholly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had told her without telling her:
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      With this last piece of me, I am completely yours.
     </em>

     *****
    </p>
<p>
     By the time Agatha's alarm sounded before the sun had even considered reaching for the horizon, Rio had slept maybe three hours, at most. Even those three hours had been broken at least twice by her jolting awake, feeling like she had been falling in a dream.
    </p>
<p>
     Each time, she would blink, focus, and then look down at the weight on her chest to see Agatha, still sound asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     Every time, she would muse to herself that Agatha likely could have slept through an earthquake with the emotional exhaustion she had to be feeling at carrying something so heavy around with her for the better part of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Even trying to write it off as being human and making mistakes never would have worked for her. Agatha
     <em>
      knew
     </em>
     that what she had done was wrong, that it had been bad choice after bad choice. It might have been what she needed to make it through her life at the time, but that did not negate the guilt she was feeling as a result of making
     <em>
      those
     </em>
     specific choices. It wasn't even the act itself, Rio knew, it was that Agatha had found a loophole in the one staunch belief she had and she had abused it.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio could see, so plainly, was that Agatha was afraid. She had been afraid that Rio could come about that knowledge from an outside source, and she had been afraid of what that knowledge might do to Rio without any other context presented. She had been afraid that Rio might jump to the conclusion that Agatha was capable of such things within the confines of
     <em>
      their
     </em>
     marriage.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been afraid that Rio would leave just when they really started to begin, and she had also convinced herself that if it were to happen, Rio would be justified.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, how broken Agatha Harkness was.
    </p>
<p>
     And oh, how Rio Harkness-Vidal loved her so, regardless.
    </p>
<p>
     Every single fractured piece was picked up and handled with measured care as Rio spent her time sliding them back into the frame. Each and every one was stained in some color or another from Agatha's past experiences. Once assembled, Rio knew she would be in full view of everything Agatha truly could be when the light caught her just right.
    </p>
<p>
     It would be an image bestowed upon the walls of the Temple of Agatha that Rio held in its own space in her mind. There was work to be done in restoring that glass work of art, but Rio had time and she would ensure that not a shard got left behind.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio
     <em>
      saw
     </em>
     Agatha. Maybe Agatha hadn't quite figured that out, but that did not the negate the facts of such a reality. Rio knew that Agatha had been a victim of circumstance and outside pressure to conform. She had forced down the narratives she had been fed throughout her youth and early adulthood, swallowing them like the razor blades they were, cutting her apart from the inside out.
    </p>
<p>
     The further into the chaos she threw herself, the more she had lost in terms of her personal integrity. These were things that almost anyone else in the world would never know about Agatha Harkness, and Rio would have been truly floored to be informed that anyone else at all was aware of the information Agatha had given her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew now, and nothing had changed.
    </p>
<p>
     They had spent a few extra minutes in bed, with Agatha having declared that she'd set her alarm a bit early so they could revel in a few last minute Iceland cuddles before they finished packing their things and called a car to take them to the airstrip outside of the city. Jack had texted her the day before to inform her that The Hoatzin had landed and would be waiting when they were ready to depart.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had stopped at the foot of the steps that led up to the jet, her head turning as she swept in the white landscapes splayed out for miles and miles. So many accomplishments, so many memories, and so many emotions seemed to flood her and caused a prickling at the backs of her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     She realized suddenly that she was feeling something she had felt only once before.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the exact amalgamation of emotions that had left her moved the night she had stopped in the doorway of the hotel room at the Freehand when she had checked out to go home with Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been a goodbye to a beginning. Right then, it was too similar to be anything other than the same, just thousands of miles away and considerably colder.
    </p>
<p>
     The Freehand was where Rio had fallen in love with Agatha Harkness.
    </p>
<p>
     Iceland was where Rio fell even further in love with her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     "My love, are you alright?" Agatha called to her from the top of the steps, leaning through the doorway to be heard clearer.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head snapped to her and she offered a small smile in the growing light of dawn. "I am," she answered, turning her head to look out one last time. "Just committing it to memory before I go."
    </p>
<p>
     The tired and warm smile her wife wore as she waved her hand in encouragement felt so comforting, like a tight hug that always told her where Agatha went, she would always want her to follow.
    </p>
<p>
     It had not taken long for them to get settled and moments after, they were in the air again, headed back to America to begin the process of sorting their lives out. Rio understood that Agatha was on edge about it, and she understood why even more now, but as Agatha's eyes stayed locked on the window beside her, Rio could tell that the thoughts were plaguing her, trying to claw at her enough to pull her down.
    </p>
<p>
     She let her have a few minutes, sipping at the little bottle of juice she had pulled from the mini fridge on the jet. By the time she noticed the small little 'eleven lines' as she liked to call them that had formed between Agatha's brows, she knew she had to ask. She sat up a bit, but just as her lips parted, Agatha spoke first.
    </p>
<p>
     "I need to have a talk with Nicholas," she announced, though tones were soft and hushed. If Rio didn't know any better, she swore she could hear that shame seeping back in. Not only that, but she had used their son's full name, indicating the weight of what was on her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     "About... What we discussed?" Rio asked back, tilting her head slightly. That... Did not seem like the best idea, and it was one thing Rio
     <em>
      would
     </em>
     probably try to talk her out of. There were just some things that children didn't need to know, no matter how old they got.
    </p>
<p>
     "No," Agatha responded, turning her head away from the window so she could look to Rio, sat in the seat across from her. "But about everything else, though. He... Needs to know the truth about my marriage with Colton, and... About how he came to be. And about Colton's coma... I..." Agatha stopped herself, jaw snapping shut and lips pressing tight. "There are things I am sure he has perceptions and feelings about and, while justified, might be lacking context. And... I think he has a right to finally know."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was not going to tell her it was a bad idea, even though it probably wasn't a good one. Agatha had been wrestling with the complex emotions that had only been able to stem from complex decisions she had made and now, she had to untangle it all. Agatha had suffered at her own hand for far too long and Rio recognized this for what it was: Agatha was looking for penance.
    </p>
<p>
     "That is a very big decision," Rio concurred her, but was quick to continue, "and I support you completely. I think we both know that it's a very precarious conversation to have and no matter what way it goes, you know I have your back. And his, because I love you both."
    </p>
<p>
     The corners of Agatha's mouth tucked downward and those blue eyes softened exponentially. Rio could see that while she was not going to cry, Agatha was panicking. Surely she had known that this day might come, but she had clearly walked so far away from those buried memories that she thought they couldn't come back.
    </p>
<p>
     They had, and now Rio was watching as Agatha scrambled to keep all the pieces intact.
    </p>
<p>
     "My love," Rio cooed at her softly. While she had debated reaching for Agatha's hands, she chose a more direct approach instead. She was on her feet in the blink of an eye, turning so that she could place herself on Agatha's lap, their thighs perpendicular as she settled. "You are going to have to try so very hard to give yourself some grace. I know that you have to have your hackles raised everywhere else, but not with me. Not with the kids. We love you, with no conditions."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio moved her arm, draping it along Agatha's shoulders, tucking beneath the length of her ponytail. "But, that does not keep us from experiencing negative emotions toward situations we don't like. That being said, the fact that we love you never changes."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted her head, those beautiful eyes so absolutely wrought with emotion and indecision. Her lips worried together for a moment, trying to piece together some sort of response.
    </p>
<p>
     "I never wanted to be a bad person. I... Just made bad choices."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio went slack, her heart physically hurting at hearing Agatha make such a statement.
    </p>
<p>
     "My love," Rio offered, reaching up to cup Agatha's cheek in her palm. "I will never hesitate to tell you that making bad choices does not make you a bad person. In fact, I will go so far as to tell you, time and time again, that you are
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     a bad person. You are fierce and stern with those you don't know or care for because of your station in the world. That's not
     <em>
      bad.
     </em>
     You sought liberation in the throes of misery and while those choices weren't
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     , they do not make
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     bad."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha seemed to be truly listening, taking in and digesting such a concept. There were the smallest twitches in her face, almost imperceptible, but Rio saw them as the information began to land and fasten into Agatha's comprehension. Once again, she looked emotional but no tears came.
    </p>
<p>
     "How do you see so much good in me?" she questioned and while Rio had almost expected the question to come out broken or quiet, she had been surprised when it was resolved and strong.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gentle and adoring smile was instant. She leaned forward and pressed her lips to Agatha's forehead, bringing her far hand to cradle the back of Agatha's head as she did so.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because, my love, I see
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     , not the you that you present to the rest of the world. And that Agatha
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     good. She is a mother who loves her children, even the ones she did not raise. She is a lover who I know
     <em>
      for a fact
     </em>
     is devoted to her wife. She is a successful and incredible creative who pours her heart into everything she does." Rio's explanation, breathed against Agatha's forehead, was factual and pointed, leaving no room for misunderstanding.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha Harkness is a complex woman, but I will always take the time to figure you out, even if it's not that difficult."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha Harkness-Vidal," Agatha corrected her, pulling back so she could tip her head back.
    </p>
<p>
     "Right, right. How could I forget?"
    </p>
<p>
     With a grin that was tapered immediately, Rio placed a tender kiss to her wife's lips. It was another promise, another guarantee that no matter how things went, Rio was going to be right there to help her through it.
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     When they had landed in LA a little after 8am, Rio had expected to find Gio waiting for them to take them home so that they could collapse in bed and sleep off the jetlag and nerves for at least an entire day.
    </p>
<p>
     What she hadn't expected was for their four children to be waiting in the hanger to greet them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha saw them first, through the window, as they stood by the car and immediately called Rio's attention, pointing a thin finger to indicate them. Leaning forward, the sight of them caused a grin so big to form on her face that she thought it might crack.
    </p>
<p>
     Their feet had not even touched American concrete by the time Estee had taken off, bolting over to where they were to throw her arms around Rio's neck, hugging her nightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, mija, I missed you so much," Rio greeted into her thick hair.
    </p>
<p>
     "I've been away longer before because of uni," Estee returned, but she wasn't done and continued when she pulled back to look at her mother. "But knowing I couldn't hop on a couple hour flight to come see you hit a little different. Glad to have you home."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio reached up, ruffling her daughter's hair to then pull her in so Rio could kiss her forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     "Did you lot have fun while we were gone?" Rio asked, though as she lifted her gaze, it fell on the sight of Agatha with Nicky in her arms, holding him tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky did not know what was in his immediate future, but Rio did, and as such knew what that kind of an embrace meant to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "We did," Nicky chirped, untangling himself from his mother. Before he could offer any insight, Estee was speaking again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Give me that," she requested, indicating Rio's small bag that was clutched in her fingers. Rio's eyes dropped as Estee extended her hand and then they widened at what she saw there.
    </p>
<p>
     On the outside of her wrist, to the right of her pulse point, there was a small silhouette of a bird in flight tattooed on her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's free hand snapped up, hooking around Estee's forearm, those bright green eyes completely locked in on the new ink.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "No way,"
     </em>
     Rio breathed, fixated to a point where she did not notice as everyone else shuffled over, Nicky and Agatha included. "Estrella Liliana, when did you get this?"
    </p>
<p>
     "We all got them," Nicky voiced.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted her head, turning to the sight of Nicky, Tay, and Hēmi all holding their arms up, small birds branded into their skin in the same spot as Estee's and the largest grins on their faces.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was a few days after you left. We were eating dinner and talking and... Birds of a feather flock together, right? Plus, we're on planes so damn much," Estee explained, laughing softly.
    </p>
<p>
     Such an explanation almost took Rio out at the knees. She had always known what a personal whirlwind this had all been since that very first day, but knowing that her daughter had formed these bonds, these relationships with people she had come to love irrevocably, it touched Rio. She was seeing first-hand what it meant to Estee to finally have a family.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio released her hold, Estee's focus dropped in time to see the way Rio's hand moved palm-up, revealing her own mark of forever.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh! Hypocrite!" she cried, this time the one to grab hold of Rio's forearm to pay closer attention to what she saw there. "Mama, oh my god..."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt swelteringly hot beneath her daughter's scrutiny but did her best to shake the feeling and appear as nonplussed as she could.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's not the only one," came Agatha's insight this time. She was quick, reaching for the waist of her pants in a way that caused Nicky's hand to fly to his eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, stop it, Nicky," she chastised, lowering the band just enough to reveal the green paper flower that was inked there.
    </p>
<p>
     "You guys!" Estee gushed, but Rio was removing her hold so that she could reveal her own on the opposite hip as Agatha's, hers that soft purple color. Estee looked back to her and dropped her attention, her grin so wide and toothy Rio knew it had to hurt. "I cannot believe you heathens!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, that's seriously the cutest," Tay chimed from half a foot behind Estee.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha has another one, too," Rio informed them, glancing to her wife with a bright curl of her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha reached up at the same time she leaned forward a little, pulling her ponytail to the opposite side so that she could bend her ear forward to reveal the terribly drawn boat behind it.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's the one she drew when she showed up at the office and left her number," Agatha informed those who might not have been aware of what such a mark actually meant.
    </p>
<p>
     "So..." Nicky began, the numbers adding up in his head. "The four of us collectively got four tattoos... And jointly, you guys got four tattoos. So... We have gained eight tattoos since the wedding. What in the world?" He had already started laughing before he finished speaking, joined a moment later by everyone else.
    </p>
<p>
     It
     <em>
      was
     </em>
     pretty crazy.
    </p>
<p>
     But it was also
     <em>
      so very them.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "Did any of you have to bail any of the others out of jail in our absence?" Agatha asked, eyes sweeping around to the four twenty-somethings in their presence.
    </p>
<p>
     "There was only the one time Estee --" Hēmi started, but Estee's hand flew up immediately to silence him.
    </p>
<p>
     "HE'S KIDDING!" she all but shouted, causing Rio to grin. She knew Estee was lying. It was painfully obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     "What did you do, mija?" Rio asked, chin tucking in her interrogation.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay so
     <em>
      maybe
     </em>
     there was a girl at the club flirting with Hēmi who wouldn't leave him alone while Nicky was getting drinks. And
     <em>
      maybe
     </em>
     I walked behind her and pulled her hair hard enough that she fell. We left promptly after." She told the story as though she were completely in the right, punctuating the end with an innocent shrug of her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, there was no 'maybe' to it," Nicky shot, his grin wide and toothy. "She folded that bitch like a lawn chair. I saw it from the bar."
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicholas! Why are you making me sound like a cage fighter?!" she almost screeched, looking a little flustered at being sold out with such ease.
    </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, everyone else had given into completely amused laugher at the two of them bickering like siblings. It was touching, really, especially for Rio who was now getting more of a view of what being an actual family was going to look like. Sure, their children were grown, but they acted like they had spent their entire lives annoying each other and driving one another insane.
    </p>
<p>
     "You should moonlight," Hēmi suggested through his chuckling. "I'd put my money on you."
    </p>
<p>
     After a few more exchanged embraces, the six of them loaded into the Lexus Gio had been smart enough to bring from Agatha's personal garage. As everyone loaded in, Nicky was left on the concrete, stomping his foot in his feigned petulance.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why do I have to sit up front by myself?" he whined, though he was grinning despite himself.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, what am I? Chopped liver?" Gio called, leaning back so he could see Nicky through the open back door.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course not, Gio," Nicky returned, opening the front door to slide into the passenger's seat. "You're the best DJ in LA. Let's play some Nickelback."
    </p>
<p>
     There was a collective groan from every other occupant in the car which caused Nicky to fall prey to bright and loud laughter, thrilled with his own antics.
    </p>
<p>
     The ride home had been comparatively short than it felt most times, due mostly to the vibrant and bright chatter from the occupants. There was so much love in that car, so much care and dedications between every single one of them. Rio and Agatha were not shy about how much they had missed the lot of them, but the kids seemed eager to assure them that they had been just as missed and how deeply their absences were felt.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee and Tay had spilled about the couple of times they'd hung out with a few of the Landon women -- Cole, Dalia, and Thea -- on the beach or grabbing dinner, clearly thrilled with making new friends stateside. Nicky and Hemi talked about their brief trip to Tijuana and all of the fresh fruit they'd brought back with them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could have sat there all day long, just listening to their children talk about their lives. She was taking every word in, devouring the utter joy she was receiving from listening to their laughter and them tattle on each other about the mischief they had been up to over the past couple of weeks.
    </p>
<p>
     They had already become a family before the wedding, but on that car ride home, Rio really, truly felt it. She could feel the adoration, the affection that was filling the enclosed space around them and wove into each and every one of them. They were truly the Harkness-Vidals in all of their glory, even before it was official for Tay and Hēmi.
    </p>
<p>
     The kids had been insistent in carrying in their things and the two women had followed them upstairs as they stowed the suitcases and bags just inside the bedroom door and straightened back up to offer embraces.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm taking Hēmi to the airport in about an hour. He's got training this week," Nicky informed them as he parted from the embrace he had given his mother.
    </p>
<p>
     "Aww," Rio whined softly in protest as she pulled Hēmi into her arms, giving him a tight hug. "Sad that you can't stay longer, but we really appreciate that you stayed to greet us."
    </p>
<p>
     "Wouldn't have missed it," he assured her, giving her shoulder a light squeeze. "I should be back in a couple of weeks, if only for the weekend."
    </p>
<p>
     "We will always be happy to have you," Agatha informed him, holding her arms open to hug him, too.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're gonna lay down too," Estee informed them, sliding up to Rio's side so that she could wrap her arms around her mother's middle, locking in tightly. "But if you want to go to In-N-Out later, come find us. We will be happy to tag along."
    </p>
<p>
     "You got it, mija," Rio agreed easily, kissing the top of her head.
    </p>
<p>
     "Me too!" Nicky chimed.
    </p>
<p>
     "You never turn down a Flying Dutchman," Agatha chided, digging a finger into his ribs at the same time she kissed the side of his head. A mere second later, she threw her hands up, waving them about dramatically. "Alright! Children! Move about your lives! Your mothers have a nap to take, one of dire importance!"
    </p>
<p>
     Every other person in the room, Rio included, dissolved into laughter, though the kids had already started to shuffle toward the doorway.
    </p>
<p>
     "We love you," Agatha called after them, Rio agreeing in the next breath.
    </p>
<p>
     "And be safe, Hēmi!" Rio added, her voice loud enough to carry down the hallway.
    </p>
<p>
     "I will, Mama Rio! Enjoy your nap!"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was grinning from ear to ear, even as she turned directly into Agatha's embrace, arms locked tightly around her middle as Rio's head dropped to her shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "We are home,"
     </em>
     Agatha murmured at her, giving her a firm squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "We are. And we are exhausted. Maybe not the best idea to stay up so late,"
     </em>
     Rio teased in a whisper, giggling quietly as she tipped her head back to brush her lips against the side of Agatha's neck.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Maybe not. But... I don't have anything scheduled for two more days. So, technically, we could sleep for the next two days and be fine."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio lifted her head, looking directly into those warm, comforting blue pools of endless hope as her lips curled up at the corners.
     <em>
      "Maybe just a couple of hours at first. And then we can take the kids and I can get my Crazy-Style fries."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Animal style,"
     </em>
     Agatha corrected, but the moment she saw the look in Rio's eyes, she slumped slightly.
     <em>
      "You do that on purpose, don't you?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio ducked her head forward, stealing a chaste kiss, first from Agatha's lips and then one on the tip of her nose.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Of course I do. You think it's adorable, and don't saw it's not true because I know it is."
     </em>
     Rio took one last kiss before she untangled herself from the way she'd been wrapped around her wife and stripped her t-shirt and hoodie off. They were unceremoniously discarded and she shed her leggings as well, leaving her in only her bra and little boy short underwear as she crawled into bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nearly mimicked her actions step for step, leaving them to find one another in the center of that big, comfortable, homey bed they had left empty in their absence. It took little time, curled up behind Agatha with her arms around her middle and face nuzzled into Agatha's still-wild ponytail, for Rio to drift off to sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     She was not entirely sure how long they had slept, but judging by the amount of light pouring in the windows, Rio felt she could safely assume that it was some time in the middle of the afternoon. Surprisingly, she realized that Agatha was still in her arms, still sleeping. Normally, Agatha was the first one to rouse in most circumstances, but Rio realized that it could have been a couple of things.
    </p>
<p>
     It was possible she truly was just exhausted from the emotional comedown of their conversation, but it was also possible that her subconscious was trying to prolong the conversation she knew she needed to have with their son.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did not disturb her and otherwise stayed where she was, even when she heard Nicky come in the front door and then exited out the back a few minutes later, likely to tuck into the poolhouse to unwind and text Hēmi until his flight took off. Rio wanted him to have that, to be able to find those last few moments of peace before Agatha necessarily upended his life.
    </p>
<p>
     Though her eyes were shut and her breathing stayed relatively even, Rio did not fall back asleep in the forty or so minutes it took for Agatha to wake up. Even once she did, they shifted around enough that Rio and rolled to her back and Agatha had flipped over, curling into her side.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Did you nap well, my love?"
     </em>
     Rio murmured, lips pressing and staying to the crown of Agatha's head.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Like a rock,"
     </em>
     Agatha informed her in a light groan, snuggling a little closer.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's fingers had started gentle work on Agatha's back, tracing light lines just below the band of her bra, dragging softly over her skin. They were quiet for the next passing moments, simply reveling in what it felt like to be back in their places, folded into one another in a way they would always be.
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, Agatha started to move around, pulling herself into a sitting position. She rubbed her eyes and heaved a soft sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you think it would be a good idea to get dinner first?" Rio questioned, her voice running more along the timid side, caution so very apparent.
    </p>
<p>
     "Probably not. I.. Should see if he's back home and get it out of the way," she replied, her tone mild but just above a whisper.
    </p>
<p>
     "He is. He came home a little while ago. He's in the pool house."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha sighed again, this one a little heavier.
    </p>
<p>
     "I can do this... right?" Agatha asked aloud and while Rio knew that it might have been rhetorical, she felt compelled to answer anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     "You absolutely can do this, my love," she affirmed, reaching up to gently rub Agatha's lower back in support.
    </p>
<p>
     "I suppose I should, then," she concluded. Rio had thought that she was going to get up to dress herself but instead, Agatha leaned back, dropping to hold herself up on her elbow. She dropped her head, kissing Rio full-on in a way that did not show force but certainly showed a need for strength and resolve. Rio could give her that.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you. It's going to be alright,"
     </em>
     Rio promised her when she backed away, those blue eyes opening to reveal how much fear was held within them.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "And if it's not, even for a little bit, we can have Gio go get us our cheeseburgers and eat them in bed while we turn on some film we don't pay attention to while you cope with your feelings. No matter how it goes, you just have to come back to me and we will figure it out together."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     That look on Agatha's face was so worried, but also so soft in its understanding that Rio meant every single word she had said.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you so much,"
     </em>
     Agatha whispered, stealing one more kiss before she got to her feet and pulled on a pair of shorts and a t-shirt so that she could venture forth to a battle she might never be prepared for.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha got to the doorway but stopped directly in it, hand on the frame as she turned back to look at Rio.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I can do it,"
     </em>
     she voiced, and while she said it as a statement, Rio felt the need to supply an answer.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You can do it, my love. And you will."
     </em>

</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
     Twenty minutes passed, then thirty.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was trying to keep herself busy by scrolling through the archive of photos that head4harkness.tumblr.com had curated that provided a visual timeline of most of Agatha's career. She had yet to inform Agatha that she had uncovered the blog after the first time they'd gone out for drinks with the Iceland girls and was instead taking the time to save almost every single picture found there to her phone.
    </p>
<p>
     The truth was, it was a preview of what the world had witnessed throughout the years when it came to her wife. There were photos from premieres, video clips of interviews, behind-the-scenes photos, and even a slim few from when she was in college. It was a complete catalog dedicated to the woman she loved so dearly and it instilled a variety of emotions within Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Whilst the blog title could have been deemed crass, the content posted was all tasteful and respectful. It was clear that whoever ran the blog was simply dedicated and had an appreciation for Agatha's abilities and her display of them throughout the decades.
    </p>
<p>
     Some of the photos, ones where Agatha seemed no older than mid-twenties, there was a vast difference in the brightness of her smile and eyes from the photos less than half a decade later. That was when things had changed for her, when she had made the first on a very long list of bad choices and her life's course had been altered beyond her control.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha still looked happy in those photos, but not as happy as she had before an obligatory marriage and a child she had never planned for came into the picture.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew it would do her no good to try and analyze every single photo to a point where she was making herself crazy, but she couldn't help but note the small differences, the little changes that appeared, gently scribed into those beautiful features.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe no one else would have been able to pick out the way the crow's feet at the corners of Agatha's eyes formed and deepened. It could have gone unnoticed the way those little eleven lines between her brows had rutted so much that they were still there even when she was calm and expression smoothed. No one else would have noticed the additional navy flecks that had formed in her irises the older Agatha got, not the way Rio did.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew, as she scrolled through those pictures, that there were miles and miles of her wife still left for her to explore and understand. She also knew that the only way to get that information was to ask questions, though she was impossibly understanding of the fact that it would be something better suited for another day.
    </p>
<p>
     Her green eyes flickered up to the corner of her phone screen, realizing Agatha had been gone almost an hour. As if on cue, Rio heard a soft knocking down the hall, too far to be their room. The door opened -- presumably Estee's -- and then closed again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tried to funnel her attention back onto the phone in her hand, but something was happening and she was trying to understand what without inserting herself directly into the situation. It took only a minute or two until a piece fell into place.
    </p>
<p>
     The door down the hall opened and shut again, but this time a blonde head of hair poked through the doorway and Tay, while smiling, was not completely selling that it was genuine. "I'm going to Van's for some snacks. Is there anything you or Agatha would want me to grab?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt like she was working on a slide puzzle in her mind, trying to rearrange the jumbled image before her so that it made any sort of sense. She knew that Tay had asked her a very clear question, but it had a lot of implications. Tay was not the type to make random evening grocery runs alone, and with the previous request for entrance to their bedroom, Rio knew there was more to it.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had gone to Estee.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had needed to talk to Estee, and Tay was running a mindless errand to give them some time.
    </p>
<p>
     Where was Agatha?
    </p>
<p>
     "Erm," Rio finally managed, finding her focus again as she watched Tay in the doorway. "Could you grab us a bottle of whiskey and the biggest bag of mini Snickers you can find?"
    </p>
<p>
     It was minimal, but alcohol and chocolate might not be the worst idea when it came to the night that possibly lay ahead of them.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, mama. If you think of anything else, just text me." Her voice was low, soft, but with the way she was looking at Rio like that, Rio knew that this was fragile. This was something that was going to have to be handled with care on all ends.
    </p>
<p>
     "Te amo, mija," Rio voiced, a tight smile tugging on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you, too. I'll be back in a little bit." Tay offered a light wave and departed, leaving Rio to finish trying to slide the pieces into place.
    </p>
<p>
     The question still remained.
    </p>
<p>
     Where was Agatha if Nicky was in Estee's room?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio locked her phone and set it on her nightstand as she swung her legs over the edge of the bed, pushing herself up so she could pace to the window that overlooked the back scape of their home. The light in the pool house was still on.
    </p>
<p>
     There did not appear to be any movement inside, nor could Rio see through the window to know for certain that Agatha was inside, but something in her gut told her that was where she would find her.
    </p>
<p>
     To give her a few more moments, Rio relocated to the kitchen and started a pot of coffee. Despite committing to the idea of waiting until it was done brewing and she made them each a cup, she could not help but to glance outside every so often to see if Agatha was going to choose to come out on her own.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time the coffee was done and both cups were made, Agatha remained inside the pool house.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hooked her fingers through the handles of the mugs and made her way outside, utilizing her elbows to get doors open and shut. By the time the one to the pool house clicked behind her, she was not sure what she was walking into, but what she saw nearly shattered her.
    </p>
<p>
     On the far end of the sectional inside, Agatha was bent over her knees, face buried in her hands. Rio didn't need to see the way her body was trembling to immediately know she was crying. It was a sight that had been more and more frequent as of late and while Rio understood it as milestones of personal growth for her wife, it didn't actually soften to blow of bearing witness to it happening.
    </p>
<p>
     Quietly, Rio paced over and placed both mugs of coffee on the glass table in front of the couch before sitting directly next to Agatha, only because it was not practical with how Agatha was positioned to drop all of her weight onto her like a heavy blanket that could soothe her worries. Instead, Rio shifted around enough that she could wrap her arm firmly around Agatha's shoulder, pulling her into her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Thankfully, Agatha dropped her hands and leaned into Rio's pull, her wet cheek landing on the soft fabric of her shirt. Rio's free touch lifted and found Agatha's hair, gingerly running her fingers through it to try and soothe her in whatever way she could without knowing exactly what it was that had happened and what had been said.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's alright, my love,"
     </em>
     Rio whispered and while Agatha was not making a sound, the way she was still shaking gave away the fact that she was still crying.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had been trying
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     hard to right things with Nicky, and they had come miles from the night Agatha had taken Rio home for the first time to be startled by his presence. He had said some impossibly harsh things that night, things that had really cut Agatha and as such, Rio was left wondering if this had been nothing more than a repeat.
    </p>
<p>
     The one thing that seemed to guide her away from such an assumption was that Nicky had not stormed in, he had not slammed doors, and he had been impeccably calm when he had tapped on Estee's door, at least in the way that he hadn't been trying to beat it down to get her attention. Even Tay's reaction seemed to lend to the fact that the primary emotion being felt between Agatha and Nicky was not anger but instead regret mixed with pain.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did not speak or otherwise make any sound that was not a sniffle as she let herself be held by the woman who loved her most in the world. Rio knew what a responsibility that was and she would never take it lightly. The silence wore on around them for minutes, only interrupted by the sound of the pump in the back room kicking on and off.
    </p>
<p>
     It might have felt like an eternity later, but Agatha finally began to shift, to pull herself away from Rio's chest so that they could meet eye-to-eye. Rio knew it was a way for Agatha to find her resolve, to find some crumb of strength so that she could recount something that had very obviously injured her. Everything between her and Nicky had always been so precarious, but she'd had a lot of very big and very weighted things to tell him and depending on how receptive he had been, it could very well fracture their relationship irreparably.
    </p>
<p>
     To offer her some semblance of courage, Rio lifted the hand that had been running through Agatha's hair before she had moved and cupped her cheek, thumb gracing so carefully over her wet cheek.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Whenever you're ready, I'm right here,"
     </em>
     Rio whispered, leaning in to take the briefest kiss that tasted of nothing but salt.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's bottom lip pulled in, tucking over teeth that dug into it roughly. It was clear that even though she had spent all that time trying to figure out how to discuss what she had just endured, she was still at a loss.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's okay, Agatha. We talk about it first, then we figure it out, right?"
     </em>
     Rio murmured at her, that thumb still pacing soft lines along Agatha's cheekbone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave the slightest nod of her head, so shallow in its movement that if Rio hadn't been holding onto her face and felt it, she might not have noticed it at all. Slowly, Agatha's chest rose with an even breath that she held for only a moment before she exhaled it, letting out some of her tension along with it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "That was... so hard,"
     </em>
     she began, her admittance pained and strangled.
     <em>
      "I... I told him the truth. About the night he was conceived, about staying with his father because I thought it was the right thing to do. I told him that it... It was my fault..."
     </em>
     Agatha's voice hooked and trembled over her words but the tears had stopped and she looked absolutely hell bent on not letting them start again. Her throat bobbed as she shoved down the nerves enough to make an attempt at continuing.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It was my fault that Colton treated him the way he did for so much of his life. And... I told him about keeping the coma from him. I... I tried to explain the best I could but... But he was just..."
     </em>
     Agatha's lips turned down sharply at the corners and her throat shook again with the sheer force she was using to choke down the emotion that wanted to sink her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "He was feeling a lot of different things at once,"
     </em>
     Rio attempted, though it was weak with her lack of understanding.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "He... He's so upset, and I knew he would be... But he's
      <b>
       so
      </b>
      upset that he... He didn't even lash out. He didn't yell, he didn't throw anything. He didn't even call me insane or selfish or a bitch. He just... said he needed time. And then he left..."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     In spite of the fact that she was clearly upset and unsettled by an atypical reaction from someone she knew so very well, there was an edge of anxiety in Agatha's voice that Rio wanted to quell immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned in, offering the softest kiss of reassurance before she provided an answer. "He's with Estee in her room. Tay went to the market to get some things." Rio was trying to keep this even, to not let the calm be unseated too badly. This was a painful experience for the both of them and she simply wanted to find them all a way through it. "I thought about having her stop at Del Taco on the way back because it felt like one of those fast-food-bum-around nights, but I don't think anyone's actually going to be hungry this evening."
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Agatha managed a half-ass chuckle, more of an acknowledgement that Rio was too smart for her own good than it was anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, what is it that you need right now? We can talk about it, we can sit here and drink our coffee, or we can take it inside and go upstairs and turn on the TV while we don't pay any attention to it and just lay in bed. What is best for you right now?" After having been steady for the entire time since Agatha had looked her in the eyes, Rio finally lifted her hand to instead drag her fingers through Agatha's hair, earnest emerald gaze probing for an answer.
    </p>
<p>
     The look in Agatha's eyes was contemplative, but Rio could see the depth there, the absolute uncertainty of not knowing how to navigate her own emotions. No matter how he came to be, Nicky was Agatha's everything and being at such an impasse was clearly impacting her in ways not a one of them ever could have anticipated.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Can we just go lay down?"
     </em>
     Agatha's soft question came, wracked with every nerve she was feeling right then.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Of course, my love."
     </em>
     Rio leaned forward and pressed her lips to Agatha's warm forehead, leaving them there for a few extra seconds before she pulled away and stood, holding her right hand out for Agatha to take.
    </p>
<p>
     That blue gaze dropped to Rio's hand and glassed over almost instantly at what she saw there, what she would always see there every time she looked at that outstretched hand.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      What a soft place to land.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She had been the one to pen it, but she had never known at the time just how true it would come to be and how true it would remain forever.  Right then, Rio's only intention was to nurse her wounds in whatever way she possibly could. It didn't matter that it wasn't going to be easy, or that she was bound to incur a few bruises here and there at seeing two of the people she loved most in the world crumbling to pieces. None of that mattered
     <em>
      because
     </em>
     Rio loved them and would do whatever she could to find a way to fix this.
    </p>
<p>
     Both of them were entitled to their feelings, and they were feeling very different things for very different reasons. What Rio could do in those moments was tend to her wife in the very same way that her daughter had taken on the task of tending to her brother.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite the sheen over her gaze, no more tears spilled down Agatha's cheek and she firmly took hold of Rio's hand, getting to her feet so that they could head inside. The two cups of still-hot coffee sat abandoned on the table in their exit, no longer necessary.
    </p>
<p>
     Coffee didn't matter when Agatha was in pain.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had stopped only to swipe a couple of bottles of water from the refrigerator before she caught up with Agatha on the stairs and the continued to tuck themselves into the confines of their bedroom. In a move that was usually only typical of after-hours debauchery, Rio braved to shut the door. It was a way to give Agatha her privacy, to let her know that she could fall apart and have some time to compose herself if a knock happened to come.
    </p>
<p>
     The way that Agatha departed from Rio to travel to her side of the bed left Rio watching and aching. Even though Rio knew a softer side of Agatha, this broken one was not something she knew how to navigate, but she was trying. All she knew how to do was be present, to be available, and to be ready to do whatever it was that her wife needed in the moment.
    </p>
<p>
     As Agatha dumped herself into bed, it was clear that she just needed to be held and to let her feelings settle. It was likely she was already jumping to the worst conclusions, but if those thoughts started to become too much, Rio knew Agatha would find it in herself to voice them. She knew she had already and she would always have that safety to keep doing so.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew -- she was convinced -- all there was to know now, and she still would have gone to the ends of the earth to see to it that Agatha recovered from the blow this had all dealt her.
    </p>
<p>
     Some would have said Agatha had brought all of it on herself, but Rio knew that would have been insanely reductive. Agatha had led a complex life that had been informed by the way she had been raised and the people that had been around her. She'd done the wrong things at the wrong times and it had built a rickety foundation for her to try to construct a life atop. Clearly, it had failed miserably and she'd needed to start over, which left them in that moment with Agatha curling into Rio's side the very instant her back met the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's arm wrapped snugly around her, holding her close enough that she could kiss the top of her head, breathing her sentiment against it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you more than anything, Agatha, and it's going to be okay."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha's reply was barely more than a squeak.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I know."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She said she knew, but that little sound was not as convincing. Still, she didn't need to be convinced of what Rio was telling her for it to still be true.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had, as she said she would, turned on something completely random and lowered the volume on the television enough that it was a soft hum to fill some of the silence. She often stared at it while Agatha laid on her chest, but she wasn't actually watching whatever was on the screen. Instead, she was thinking about a way forward, a path that they might be able to travel that would wind up at unity once more.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, it seemed a ways off.
    </p>
<p>
     For at least an hour, the two of them laid entwined in the center of the bed, Rio hold onto Agatha like she were precious gold, tender and careful with every movement, every stroke through hair or up and down Agatha's spine. There was little Rio was capable of truly doing to aid in repairing such a rift, but one thing she could
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     do was support her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     She was still entirely awake and alert when she heard a soft tap on their bedroom door.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah?" she called loud enough to be heard and encourage entry.
    </p>
<p>
     When Nicky was the one to open the door, Agatha was upright in the blink of an eye, but he did not look at her. Instead, his green eyes dropped to Rio and he offered an unsure curve of his lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey mama," he greeted, the uncertainty so loud over his quiet words. "Do you... I'm going to go out back and look at the stars... Do you wanna come with me?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha deflated next to her the very second she realized that he was not ready to speak with her yet, though she had divulged at one point in the hour they'd been laying there that he said he had needed a few days. Still, to feel that hope drain out of her was hard for Rio ina  way she knew she did not have an appropriate name for.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio realized that he was not actually asking her to look at the stars with him, much in the same way Agatha did. What he needed was to talk, to have someone listen who could offer a unique perspective that he would never be able to obtain otherwise. As much as it pained her to leave Agatha in that bedroom alone, she knew that she had made a vow to love and support them both and such a time had come, it was just a little more of a struggle to make the choice than she had ever surmised it might.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course," she answered, sitting up enough so that she could place a gentle kiss to a discouraged Agatha's cheek, whispering softly against it.
     <em>
      "I'll be back as soon as I can."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     By the time Rio had climbed out of bed, Nicky had already disappeared from the doorway. As she emerged into the hallway, he was heading down the steps and Rio could feel every single spot in every single cavern and crevice of her heart that ached to see her wife and their son both in so much pain. Even worse was knowing that it was necessary, that it had to be felt for them to be able to move forward with a clean slate, everything laid bare.
    </p>
<p>
     When she stepped onto the back patio and pulled the door shut behind her, she was surprised to see that he had opted for the bench swing instead of the chairs. Despite that, she still paced over and placed herself next to him, leaving only a couple of inches of space between them.
    </p>
<p>
     The crickets chirped and sang in the night and for several minutes, it was the only sound that permeated their space. Rio let it linger a little while longer before her soft tones broke through, a gentle prodding but also an allowance for further introspection.
    </p>
<p>
     "Take your time. I'm right here as long as you need me to be," Rio assured him, though she did not turn her head to take him in. If anything, the last thing he was needing was to be scrutinized, or even feel like he was being perceived. Rio held no bias here and was simply at a point where she wanted to heal the people she loved from wounds that were bound to come to light.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky drew in a long, measured breath and exhaled it slowly, pressing his lips together as he tried to find the will within himself to speak. At last, his voice sounded.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I could say I'm not angry, but that's... Not entirely true. The only thing I'm actually angry about is that I don't know
     <em>
      how
     </em>
     to feel," he attempted, though his voice was weak and void of his usually Nicky confidence. "I'm pissed that she waited so long... But then I understand why. I'm hurt that she didn't feel like she could be honest with me once I was an adult, even if I'm not sure it would have made any difference to have this conversation four years ago as opposed to now."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky was a good kid and while he could act arrogant and cocky, Rio had learned pretty quickly that he had a good heart, he was just so fiercely protective of it. This Nicky was the one who had let his guard down only to be hurt by the woman who had given him life.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't actually care about her not telling me he was in a coma. If she would have, even before you came into the picture, I'm not sure I would have wanted to be sucked back into his bullshit again. What I care about... And what hurts the most right now..." The words began to tremble and slide toward one another as he fought to keep going despite the emotion welling inside of him. "What hurts is that I can't help but feel like I wasn't worth the truth."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio let this settle, but once it had she was quick to form her response.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's not that you weren't worth the truth, Nicky, it was just that she didn't know
     <em>
      how
     </em>
     to tell you. She loves you and... Especially lately, things have been healing and repairing in a way she never thought she would have." Rio paused, this time actually braving a glance at him, her eyes soft as they surveyed him in the dim porch light. "It's always been about trying to protect you, she just... Didn't go about it the right way. And I think... I think we both know that it's deserving of forgiveness more than condemnation."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky actually looked at her that time, not only hearing how much she meant it, but seeing it too. He pressed his lips together and nodded once, turning his gaze out toward the pool as the silence fell over them once again.
    </p>
<p>
     A couple minutes passed and Rio had considered asking him what else was on his mind but he answered such an inquiry before she voiced it.
    </p>
<p>
     "When you got pregnant with Estee... How... How did you handle it?" He hesitated but still kept his eyes fixed ahead of him. "I just... I know it's different, but... You weren't ready either... And... And when did you tell her?"
    </p>
<p>
     Those questions felt like javelins, one after another, throttled directly into Rio's chest, piercing straight through her. She understood his motives and could see what it was he was trying to learn, but Rio knew that it was an outlook that was solely seeking to compare too vaguely similar situations in a big way and Rio simply could not afford to perpetuate that.
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicholas," she murmured, turning in her place on the swing to face him fully. "I understand
     <em>
      why
     </em>
     you're asking that question, but any answer I might provide would not be a fair comparison of the situations. I don't even know that right now, I can provide you a response as to why that is as delicately as you might need. But... I think you already know why."
    </p>
<p>
     His lips tucked at the corners and his eyes were shimmering with the threat of tears, but he nodded his understanding anyway, a sign that he knew Rio was right. What followed was another shot to the chest, something that nearly shattered Rio the very moment it touched her ears.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I thought it was my fault that she didn't love me when I was a kid."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Immediately, Rio made a grab for Nicky's hand, pulling it into both of her own to hold onto it as tightly as she could manage, imbuing every bit of grip strength she had into the exchange. "Hey, hey, no. That's not fair either," she informed him in a gentle murmur, tilting her head at him as she debated how to proceed.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I know that might be how you
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     at the time, but I promise you, Nicholas, the
     <em>
      truth
     </em>
     is that your mother has
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     loved you. She just... hasn't always known the right way to show it. Back then... She thought that she was leaving you with someone who
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     show it. She did not know what was going on until you were the one to tell her."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky's lips twisted as he tried to plug that information into the correct inputs, trying to understand it for the truth it was, but Rio could see that he was struggling.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I..."
     </em>
     he attempted, but he seemed to choke on the words that he wanted to use. Rio knew what was coming on the other side of what he had to say even before it happened, like a train wreck, in front of her.
     <em>
      "I know it isn't true but... I can't help but feel like she never really wanted me."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     In confirmation of Rio's suspicion, Nicky's face crumbled and the tears leapt over his lids to roll with rapid succession down his cheeks. Without a moment's hesitation, Rio was closing the space between them and shifting to a position that allowed her to pull her son into her arms, holding him tightly to her chest the way she had done with his mother not more than an hour ago.
    </p>
<p>
     An automatic hand raised and smoothed over his short and soft hair, shushing him softly the harder he cried.
    </p>
<p>
     In that second, Rio had no clue how she was doing it. She had absolutely no idea how she was able to keep soldiering on through seeing both Agatha and Nicky in such wrecked states. And then, it struck her.
    </p>
<p>
     She loved them.
    </p>
<p>
     That was how she was doing it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio tipped her head forward and pressed her lips to the crown of Nicky's head, letting them rest there briefly before she found her ability to speak, channeling her thoughts into his hair in the softest whispers.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Your mother loves you and I love you. Your sisters love you. And even if he hasn't said it directly yet, Hēmi loves you too. You are a very important and impossibly valued member of this family. Each and every one of us love everything you are, even the you that is hurt and upset right now."
     </em>
     Rio's hand dropped from Nicky's head and landed instead on his shoulder, palm cupping so smooth over it.
     <em>
      "You are an amazing young man, Nicholas, and not a day goes by that she is not both thankful and proud that you are her son. Of anything in the world to know, I
      <b>
       need
      </b>
      you to know that."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had not expected an answer. What she had expected was for the weight of that to hit him with a bit of force, force that might cause him to cry harder. She had been correct. All she could do in response was hold him tighter, cling to him a little more to show that she was there with him, that she was there
     <em>
      for
     </em>
     him.
    </p>
<p>
     She was patient, letting him work through it and get it out of his system. He did not move from her hold by the time he finally relocated his ability to speak.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I think I need to go to Auckland... To be with Hēmi for a few days. Just... To process."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     While Rio knew that such a decision would surely bring more pain for Agatha, it was a reasonable response to the whirlwind of what he was experiencing.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Book yourself a flight,"
     </em>
     Rio encouraged.
     <em>
      "Pack a bag and I'll have the girls take you to LAX."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     This seemed to have caught him off guard, judging by the way he lifted his head and looked over at her, brow knit in confusion.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Really?"
     </em>
     he asked, raising a hand to wipe at his puffy and red eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Yes, really. You don't have to tell her, I will. But... Can you promise me that you'll come back?"
     </em>
     The question was gentle, tender in that she wanted to know for certain that this situation had not reached the point of no return.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'll come back when I'm ready, I promise,"
     </em>
     he told her, his beautiful green eyes so honest in the light from the porch and the moon combined.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Then get your things ready. I'll let Estee and Tay know when I go back upstairs."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The expression that filled his face was somehow a perfect blend of relief and gratitude, as if he had ever considered the idea that Rio might try to fight him on what he thought the best course of action for himself was. She leaned forward and pressed her lips to his forehead briefly before she pulled back and got to her feet.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mama?"
     </em>
     came his voice, small and quiet behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     She turned so that she could meet his gaze from where he sat, but he quickly pushed himself up and surged forward, wrapping Rio in a tight hug, clinging to her for the better part of a minute. He did not say anything throughout the duration of the embrace and even as he let her go, it still took him a few moments to find his voice.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you. Thank you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She raised a hand, the backs of her knuckles brushing gingerly over his cheek in a show of every ounce of affection she felt for him.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you, too, Nicky. Have a safe flight but please let one of us know when you get there and get to Hēmi's, okay?"
     </em>
     Rio figured it was an easy enough bargain he could uphold.
    </p>
<p>
     Without another word, he hugged her again, though this one did not last quite as long. His hold loosened, but his hands slid to her shoulders before he finally let go.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Will you..."
     </em>
     he started but bit his bottom lip as if to stop himself. When he tried to continue, Rio realized it was because he had been trying to stave off his emotions at what he was trying to say.
     <em>
      "Will you tell her that I love her? And I'll be back? Just... Just tell her that, okay?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio gave him a nod that carried with it as much sincerity as she could possibly manage.
    </p>
<p>
     "I will, just as she would want me to tell you that she loves you, and we will be here when you return."
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky's face contorted in a pained smile, his eyes glassing over again. His Adam's apple quivered slightly and he seemed to have one last thing to say.
    </p>
<p>
     "We are so fucking lucky to have you mama... I really hope you know that." With that known, he leaned forward and gave her a soft peck on the cheek and turned to disappear inside the pool house to pack his things.
    </p>
<p>
     Planted, Rio simply stared at the closed door, the shadows whipping around inside as Nicky moved about his task. She knew her sentiment would never reach him through the wood and drywall, but it still left her lips in the softest of whispers anyway.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Not nearly as lucky as I am to have you both."

<p>
     Even before Rio made it back up to the bedroom, she knew that she was in for a night of little sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been right.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha hadn't cried, but the emotion in the room had been unbearably heavy. It wasn't a comforting weight, wasn't one that subdued any wild emotions. Instead, it was something that teetered on the edge of becoming smothering.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been rather brief when she had loosely outlined her conversation with Nicky, and while she was fully aware that Agatha understood why, Rio could also tell that she was hating every minute of the censorship. It was required but still detested.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did not like not being completely up front with Agatha, but with how delicate the entire situation was, it called for careful hands and a measured release of information. She had told Agatha that he was leaving, that the girls would see him off and Hēmi would be there to pick him up when he landed. She had told Agatha what he had entrusted Rio to relay in that he did love her, he just needed some time.  She had told Agatha, with the most sincerity she felt capable of managing, that it was all going to be okay, they just had to give it time.
    </p>
<p>
     While disliking the circumstances, Agatha seemed to accept such an answer.
    </p>
<p>
     Or, she tried, at least.
    </p>
<p>
     Never once did she try to provide any vocal reason why she had to jump into action to fix the problem, but as she tried to rest, she proved just how
     <em>
      restless
     </em>
     she was actually feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     It had started with her head on Rio's chest, curled into her side. Then, she had rolled to her back and Rio had mimicked Agatha's previous position, fastening against her side. A short while later, Agatha rolled with her back to Rio and with no hesitation, Rio was on the move, wrapping her body around Agatha's from behind. Wherever Agatha tried to go within the confines of that bed, Rio was right there, stuck to her like glue.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was hurting.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew that she couldn't mend it, couldn't wave her hands and make it all better, but she could support her wife in a time when her heart was aching in ways neither of them understood. The capabilities she possessed to show Agatha support and love and care when she could not find those things within herself were endless for Rio. She would make it known until she was blue in the face if that was what Agatha needed to find a way through it.
    </p>
<p>
     Some time after two, Agatha had finally fallen asleep. Rio only knew this because she stopped moving every fifteen to twenty minutes.
    </p>
<p>
     For the first hour, Rio didn't deviate from her place behind Agatha, arm secured firmly around her middle. After the second, she started to get hot and wiggled around enough to kick the covers off of her legs and bare feet, though she resumed her position pressed to Agatha's back a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
     By the third hour, Rio knew she wasn't going to sleep. How could she when all she could do was think about the fact that for even a few days, their family felt fractured? She did not blame Agatha, did not think there was any need for guilt or remorse. What was done was done and it was better that Nicky knew now and not even longer down the road.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio also empathized, in a way, with where Agatha was coming from. She had very understandable and valid reasons for not being so forthcoming with him, especially given the state their relationship had been in before Rio had entered their lives, as indicated by both of them. It had been taut and fragile in the way that one catalyst could have snapped it clean in half and as a result, it had never felt safe to Agatha to dump that kind of weight on him.
    </p>
<p>
     Having met him in that stage of his life, Rio could agree that it had been a wise decision.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing this as it played out before her? It was glaringly obvious that both Agatha and Nicky had grown in those months, exponentially more than Rio knew herself capable of verbalizing. Agatha had grown enough to understand that the time had come for her to atone. On the other hand, Nicky had grown enough to know his own boundaries and take things like time and space so that he could properly digest his emotions without saying things in the heat of the moment that he would later regret.
    </p>
<p>
     He had once looked Agatha in the eyes beneath an inky sky on an otherwise normal night and told her that he would never respect Rio as any kind of parent.
    </p>
<p>
     That night, he had sat under a sky of the same color and called Rio 'mama' and told her how lucky they were to have her.
    </p>
<p>
     That alone was enough proof to Rio that somehow, things were going to be alright. Maybe Agatha didn't believe it in the meantime, but Rio had yet to lose the faith, even as the room around her started to lighten with the way the sun was clawing its way up the horizon.
    </p>
<p>
     She had tried to stay, tried to keep herself in bed until Agatha roused so that she would be available for whatever it was her wife might need, but the restlessness had started to border on unbearable. It was early enough she could make coffee and perhaps sit outside for a bit of self-reflection. The girls tended to sleep in more often than not and with the way Agatha had tossed and turned until the early hours of the morning, Rio had a sneaking suspicion that she was likely going to find consciousness a bit later than usual as well.
    </p>
<p>
     The orange hues of the rising sun streamed through the front windows, illuminating parts and pieces of the house, broken up here and there by the shadows of the walls between windows. The smell of coffee began to fill the space of the kitchen and something about it felt like a comfort to Rio, a gentle hug to remind her that there were still things that were normal in life.
    </p>
<p>
     After the pot finished and she poured herself a mug, Rio picked up her coffee and made her way outside around the back of the house. She could sit in the lounger, or she could perhaps go down to the water; it was only a minute long walk and surely looked beautiful in the light of the rising sun. Instead, she chose to pad over to the edge of the pool, roll up the legs of her pajama pants, and plant herself on the concrete, legs sliding easily into cool water.
    </p>
<p>
     There was such a duality to the entire set of circumstances that had befallen their family and Rio was struggling to find the balance in it. Everyone was making the correct choices, handling things in all of the right ways, but it didn't keep any of them from hurting.
    </p>
<p>
     This, Rio knew, was a prime example of how the right choice sometimes wasn't going to be the easy choice.
    </p>
<p>
     None of this was easy. It was difficult for both Agatha and Nicky to be experiencing, she was sure, but it was difficult for her to sit by and watch, knowing nothing she could do would make it any better. Even worse was knowing that really, there wasn't even much that could be done to begin with.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had played her role. She had held both mother and son in their tears and did her best to soothe them, to ease their worries. She did not know if she had actually succeeded in such a goal, but she had tried and that felt like the most important part.
    </p>
<p>
     Something in her had thought that once Agatha had fallen asleep, she might break, might shed tears over the heartache she was feeling at bearing witness to everything happening. Surprisingly, even as she sat at the edge of the pool and sipped at her piping hot coffee with too many thoughts to count rolling through her head, Rio did not cry.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she released a sigh full of as much tension as she could muster, dispelling it from her form in a move that felt very reminiscent of what Agatha had taught her in the bathroom of that Queenstown hotel room the night Nicky had turned up unexpectedly.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a bullet point on a long list of things Rio had learned simply by being with and around Agatha. The beauty of what they had was that anything could be a teachable moment through the right lens, they just had to be willing to adjust the scope.
    </p>
<p>
     Not certain how long she'd been sitting there with her mind circling laps over the same thoughts and emotions, Rio nearly jumped out of her skin as she caught movement out of the corner of her eye dangerously close to where she was sitting. The moment her head snapped to the right to see what it was, she was met with the sight of her daughter settling on the concrete next to her, legs making the softest splash as they dropped into the water.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good morning, mija," Rio voiced, swapping her coffee to her left hand so that she could reach up to hold the far side of Estee's head, pulling her closer to press a kiss to her hair. "Did you sleep alright?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Morning, mama. I slept... okay, I guess," Estee answered, scooting a little closer to Rio. "I would ask you the same, but I think it would be a safe assumption to deduce that you probably didn't sleep much, if at all."
    </p>
<p>
     "Have I told you that you're a smart kid?" Rio's question was soft, but it was also light in its taunting as she leaned toward Estee, playfully bumping their shoulders together.
    </p>
<p>
     "Sometimes, but could do with more," Estee teased with a returned nudge of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted her head and looked out across the expanse of the pool, the water calm once the ripples from their legs ebbed into smoothness. She wanted to broach the topic of what had happened the night before, but she wasn't quite sure where the best place to start might be. She didn't know what Nicky had told Estee and as such, she was not sure of what questions she might want or need to ask.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she had succeeded in finding the best path forward, Estee found her voice first.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... About last night..." she started, though her voice was soft. That choice of tone was not one of shame or secrecy but was rather one that knew the conversation ahead of them was one that called for a little tenderness. "I... Am not entirely sure what all he told you, and I don't want to breech his trust by saying something I shouldn't, so maybe we should start with what he told you," Estee suggested, turning her head for those beautiful green eyes to take Rio in.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew how intelligent her daughter was, and had always known, but when she phrased things so delicately and was still somehow clear in her demands, it stunned Rio almost every time. Estee had this way with words, this intention that was so threaded into who she had grown into as a young woman, and Rio was blown away when it presented itself in such a wholesome manner.
    </p>
<p>
     By making such an ask, Estee was not only proving that she had grown to love Nicky, but she was also proving that she was loyal to him, too. This could have been tricky to navigate and also could have devolved quickly into a spiral of misconceptions, but Estee was heading that off before it could even begin. She had spent years of her life understanding how to navigate things like this and it was showing, something that made Rio so impossibly proud.
    </p>
<p>
     Dark eyes fell to black coffee, the tiniest reflection of a whisp of white from a cloud overhead visible for the quickest moment before Rio looked over toward her daughter, a sad frown forming.
    </p>
<p>
     "He told me that he's not angry about much other than not knowing," she decided to start, her voice soft, her demeanor a little morose from her lack of sleep. A soft sigh passed through her lips, eyes falling into Estee's as she continued. "He's hurt because he felt like she didn't see him as worthy of being told the truth. But... I know that's not true. And I think deep down, he does too."
    </p>
<p>
     "He does," Estee cut in gently, reaching down to where Rio's hand had landed on her own thigh so that she could thread their fingers together. "We had a long talk in the car. We'll get to that. Is there anything else?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave Estee's hand a gentle squeeze, her head turning toward the pool again. "He... asked me some unfair questions that I wouldn't give him answers to, but only in the sense that he was trying to compare two very different situations that had minutely similar attributes. And... I shut it down." Rio paused, her lips twisting in thought for a moment before she let go of another quiet sigh.
    </p>
<p>
     "He said he thought she never wanted him." The admission was heavy, it was depressing, but it was also not something anyone could have told him he was wrong for feeling, and both Rio and Estee knew it.
    </p>
<p>
     "He told us that one. And he also told us what you said. You..." Estee stopped herself to clear her throat, clearly having had a much larger view of what had been inside Nicky's head. "You have no idea what it meant to him to hear you say those things. There were... A lot of tears in the car on the way to the airport, from all of us."
    </p>
<p>
     Hearing this, Rio couldn't help but wince. Pain was inevitable in life, Rio was aware, but knowing that the people she loved most were all struggling in their own ways cracked something in her. She wanted to fix it, to make it better, but that was a naive world view. Pain had to happen for change to be brought about, that was a known fact.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't like it, though. She probably never would.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been the thinnest silver lining, though. Rio had been in the trenches of everyone else's emotions to the point where she didn't have to feel or process her own. She loved her family so much that in her own mind, she'd been able to sort everything into boxes, kicking her own into a dark corner.
    </p>
<p>
     She should have known that if anyone was going to find and consequently rifle through such a box, it was going to be her daughter.
    </p>
<p>
     "How are
     <em>
      you
     </em>
     doing in all of this?" Estee questioned softly, her thumb lightly caressing Rio's knuckles.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      No!
     </em>
     Rio wanted to shout.
     <em>
      Put the box back! Do not open that box!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     "I'm fine," Rio stated, choosing in that moment to lie despite knowing it was useless.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, so," Estee began, pulling Rio's hand into her lap so that she could cover it with her free one as well. "I'm gonna ask again and we'll pretend like it's the first time and you didn't try to lie. How does that sound?" Her tones were gentle, just as her words were, but she was being very firm in her instruction. "So, mama... How are you doing?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's shoulders slumped, her thumb moving to hook over a couple of Estee's fingers with the way their hands were woven together.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's a lot, but I'm dealing with it by not dealing with it right now," she attempted to explain, though she felt as though it fell a little flat, especially to her daughter who had a degree in psychology. "I think... If I let myself hurt
     <em>
      with
     </em>
     them, I won't be in an objective enough place to be able to help them. Because I see it from both sides, and that's... A tough place to be in."
    </p>
<p>
     The hand of Estee's that did not have fingers that were interwoven with Rio's moved to gently rub at Rio's arm, trying to soothe her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're right, it is," she confirmed, leaning into Rio a little. "But while you are absolutely doing the right thing in providing all of the support you can, I think you need a little reminder to not empty yourself out in your attempt to fill everyone else up."
    </p>
<p>
     Somehow, Rio should have known the moment that Estee sat down next to her that she was in for an impromptu therapy session. It was her sage wisdom combined with her unique life experience that always seemed to guide Rio in the right direction, even if Estee was half Rio's age.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know, mija. It's just hard to do things like sleep when all I can think about is how much pain Agatha is in. I know there's nothing I can do to actively repair or heal anything, but my mind simply won't shut off long enough to let me do anything but just... Think."
    </p>
<p>
     "What about a sleep aid?" Estee posed, knowing that it was at least worth a suggestion.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's morning now, Estee," came a gentle chastising in response. "Plus, we are having dinner with Dave tonight to discuss the interview with Vogue that Agatha and I have scheduled for Friday."
    </p>
<p>
     This news delivered so casually still caused both of Estee's hands to clench, gripping Rio's hand and arm.
    </p>
<p>
     "What?! Are you serious?! When were you going to drop that morsel of information?!" she nearly squealed, though she was still considerably quiet enough to not cause any disturbance.
    </p>
<p>
     For the first time that morning, Rio's lips pulled apart in a genuine smile, though perhaps not as bright as it might have been had the surrounding circumstances been different. It was still a smile, one she meant.
    </p>
<p>
     "When I found the right time and... well, guess it's now. The day we shot you guys messages to say that we loved you, we... also found out about Wyatt's little mishap. So Agatha spoke with Dave, she and I sat down and selected an outlet. That just happened to be the one."
    </p>
<p>
     "Vogue?! Of all things, Vogue?! My parents are going to be in
     <em>
      Vogue?!
     </em>
     What the fuck is my life?" she trilled, a round of giggles tumbling from her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     In spite of the weight of what was happening with Agatha and Nicky, Rio could almost feel the shackles of her worry break for the time being at the sound of her daughter laughing. It was such a light sound, a pure one that Rio could feel within the hollow of her bones. It filled her with a warmth that had previously been chased away by anxiety and heartache.
    </p>
<p>
     Even more than the warmth of her laughter was the heat her words brought forth.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the very first time Estee had referred to both Rio and Agatha collectively as her parents.
    </p>
<p>
     For every bit of emotional fortitude that Rio had been clinging to, it all seemed to completely melt away the moment that word settled in her mind. Sure, the wedding had been the grandest gesture of them coming together as a family, but there had been a couple of weeks put between them that had stalled moments like this from happening sooner.
    </p>
<p>
     It could have been a good thing.
    </p>
<p>
     It could have been a bad thing.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, it was the
     <em>
      one
     </em>
     thing that finally moved Rio to tears.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been trying so hard to keep up that stone facade, to keep her loved ones from having to worry about her when there was already so much going on, but it had been pointless to keep trying to do so in front of Estee.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee was talented at many things, but her greatest talent to day perhaps was that she knew exactly the right strings to pull to compel Rio into shedding her armor long enough to be seen by someone who could handle it. Maybe that could be Agatha in all other aspects, just not this one, and Estee was fully aware of that fact.
    </p>
<p>
     Quickly, Estee released her hold on Rio's hand and lifted her arm, pulling her mother to her chest in an action that Rio had executed not once, but twice the night before. Rio did not make a sound outside of the way her breath would catch in her attempt to stifle her own sobs as Estee clung to her, a gentle hand rubbing up and down Rio's back in comfort.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You need to try and get some sleep, mama,"
     </em>
     Estee whispered into Rio's hair, giving her mother a light squeeze.
     <em>
      "Even a couple of hours would do you good, I think. You need to give yourself a break."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio knew she was right. She knew that Estee, in all of her twenty-two years, had developed this second sight when it came to those closest to her and in those moments, she was choosing to utilize it so that she could convince her mother to give into the natural call of rest that she had been fighting in her discomfort and anxiety. Rio didn't want to admit that she was right simply for the sake of saving face, but it was pointless to resist.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "But what if Agatha wakes up before I do?"
     </em>
     she asked back, sniffling softly. She knew it was stupid and nonsensical in the larger picture; it was a needless worry in the sense that if Agatha woke up first, there was little chance of her doing anything other than curling up into Rio and ruminating in her feelings until they were both awake enough to greet the day.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "If she happens to get out of bed before you do, I am sure Tay and I can keep her occupied, but I don't really see that happening,"
     </em>
     Estee mused in a murmur, gently beginning to sway side to side with Rio still in her arms.
     <em>
      "I am almost certain that you have used the phrase 'it's going to be okay,' a time or two in the last twenty four hours, but I don't think you've really heard it as it's come from your own lips. So... Mama, it's going to be okay."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It would not have been difficult for an outsider to glean where Estee got her emotional maturity from, and while she still was so very young, she had grown up with her feet planted in nothing but reality, both the good an the bad. It had given her a perspective to know that of anything that could happen in the world, healing could still come after. It had to, to restore the balance in the world.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I know,"
     </em>
     Rio admitted, lifting herself from Estee's hold so that she could return the embrace.
     <em>
      "And you're right, I needed to hear it from you."
     </em>
     She kissed Estee's head again and let her go, but not before giving her back a gentle rub of appreciation.
    </p>
<p>
     "Now will you please go lay down and try to get some sleep?" Estee coaxed, lightly and playfully poking a finger into Rio's ribs.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, mija, I will go lay down and try to sleep," Rio chided back, this time leaning over to kiss Estee's cheek. "I won't get sappy and cry more, but I will say that I am so lucky every single day that you are mine."
    </p>
<p>
     "Not as lucky as I am that you're my mama," Estee responded, turning her head to show Rio just how much she meant it by the look in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Te amo, mija,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured, lifting a hand to cup her daughter's cheek lovingly.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Te amo, mama. Now go!"
     </em>
     she reiterated with another bright giggle.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, Rio listened. She dumped out the unfinished portion of her coffee once back inside and climbed the stairs, not entirely shocked to find Agatha still asleep and twisted in the sheets. It was an indicator that she had not slept well, that she was tossing and turning, likely even more in Rio's absence.
    </p>
<p>
     Carefully, she fit herself between the little portion of sheet left on her side of the bed and shifted over as close to Agatha -- who was on her side and facing Rio -- as she could get without waking her, their faces close despite the room Rio had between them to pull her knees up a little toward her chest.
    </p>
<p>
     Her arms were bent at the elbows and hands had come to rest tucked near her chest and the moment her head settled into the pillow, her eyes slid shut. They had been closed for less than even a minute when something startled her.
    </p>
<p>
     It was the feeling of Agatha's hand wrapping around hers.
    </p>
<p>
     Her eyes opened to see that Agatha's own blue ones were still closed, but there was a ghost of a smile on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Go back to sleep, my love,"
     </em>
     Rio whispered, tipping her chin enough that she could raise their hands to kiss Agatha's knuckles.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Are you okay?"
     </em>
     Agatha murmured sleepily, proving this with a yawn that followed a moment later.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I am fine, I promise. Let's sleep a little longer, though, hm?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'd be okay with that. But come here first,"
     </em>
     Agatha supplied in answer, letting go of her grip around Rio's fingers so that she could lift her arm, an open invitation for Rio to come closer.
    </p>
<p>
     It took no thought for Rio to oblige, scooting forward so that she could press to her wife, their legs tangling together with ease.
    </p>
<p>
     It didn't matter that the world was falling apart around them, not right then. In those few isolated seconds of quiet, all that really mattered was that they had one another, as they always would, as they had promised when they had exchanged their vows just a couple of weeks prior. This could be the first trial, one they would overcome, but they were both of the understanding that it would be nowhere near the last, and that was okay.
    </p>
<p>
     Because once those trials were gone and the tribulations had been had, it was the two of them, wrapped in one another in that big bed.
    </p>
<p>
     Held firmly in the protective cover Agatha's arms had to offer, it took Rio a lot less time to fall asleep.
    </p>
<p>
     When she awoke, it was to the feeling of soft kisses being peppered on her face and a light tickling happening on the skin of her chest not covered by her tank top. As she opened her eyes, she understood that it was because Agatha was leaned over Rio's side of the bed and was kissing her to pull her from sleep.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "M'up, m'up,"
     </em>
     Rio grumbled, her face scrunching in disapproval that she was conscious again.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Dave just texted me, he's on his way,"
     </em>
     Agatha informed her softly, placing one more kiss to the tip of Rio's nose.
    </p>
<p>
     A low grumble rattled from Rio's slightly parted lips as she forced her eyes to actually open, beholding Agatha's tired eyes but relentlessly warm smile. Rio could see the emotion there, could see the lack of sleep, but Agatha knew, as Rio did, that life had to go on. They also both knew that the best way to get Agatha through this was to keep her busy and her mind occupied. They had plenty on the horizon to deal with and this meeting with Dave was going to be the first on a decently sized list.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Did he bring his husband this time?"
     </em>
     Rio questioned, a sleepy laugh spilling from her as Agatha lowered herself to sit on the edge of the bed. She picked up Rio's hand and idly began playing with her fingers, staring down at them.
    </p>
<p>
     "No. This time the lie was that Ozzy was bathing the dogs. I think he's just scared of me after the one time we met when I flung and entire script across a boardroom table. He has not come around since then." While Agatha was laughing about it, Rio could see that something in her might have acquired some guilt over the years as it pertained to such an issue.
    </p>
<p>
     Perhaps one day, Rio could be the buffer to spawn a second meeting, one that might be a little less tense and a little more relaxed.
    </p>
<p>
     "We'll work on that," Rio countered with a soft smile, looking up at Agatha from her spot there on her back, nestled so comfortably in bed. Her next words came through teeth that were bared in something that had escalated to a grin. "Did Dave say what he would be feeding us this evening?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha lifted her hand to cover a yawn that overtook her, causing her eyes to squeeze shut for just a moment. It was obvious that she was still tired, but they still had to move about their lives in normal fashion. "Sparrow," she answered, stretching for a moment before she settled again, her arm over Rio's body as her palm landed on the other side of her hip. "Ciabatta for me and I figured Thai turkey burger for you. He got the girls food as well, but if you'd rather the black bean one, I can still text him."
    </p>
<p>
     For just a moment, Agatha's lips tucked down and there was a ripple of anxiety in her eyes, like she might have fucked up the one thing she thought she could do right. Instead of letting her stew, Rio raised her hand to land on Agatha's thigh, giving a gentle squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha, that is perfectly fine with me. Do I have enough time to hop in the shower before he gets here?" Rio posed, though she took no immediate action to sit up, still comfortable and warm cradled by the mattress.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha picked up Rio's hand again, bringing the back of it to her lips. "Only if I can join you."
    </p>
<p>
     Such a request might have seemed mischievous to anyone else, but Rio knew better, and it was why she agreed.
    </p>
<p>
     They had been relatively quick, knowing they had a miniscule amount of time before Dave's impending arrival, but it still held that touch of warmth and affection and tenderness no matter what shower they were sharing.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they descended the stairs, hair still wet and in fresh lounging clothes, they could already hear the girls chattering happily with Dave in the living room, though he tried to keep his tones lowered, as if he were telling them a secret.
    </p>
<p>
     "He was literally six and a half feet tall, could probably lift me with one hand, and she had him in
     <em>
      tears
     </em>
     ," he told them, eyes lifting as the two women came into view on the stairs, a sheepish grin finding his face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ah, telling the kids horror stories again, David?" Agatha asked, tutting her tongue at him with a cheeky grin.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course. They think it's hilarious when you made grown men cry, don't you, girls?" he offered through a shit-eating grin of his own as he got to his feet to offer both Agatha and Rio a warm hug. "It's good to see you both in one piece and also not as giant ice chunks."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio opened her mouth to make a completely inappropriate comment, but Dave held a hand up before she could get a word in edgewise.
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't do that to these poor babies," he warned, though he was already falling prey to laughter before he finished.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips, while curled, still pressed together as she tilted her head at him in her silent chastising before she rolled her eyes. Despite the fact that it had been nearly six months since the first time Rio had actually become acquainted with Dave, he seemed to have gotten to a point where he understood Rio very quickly. He saw her motivations, understood her choices, and sometimes Rio was left wondering just what Agatha might have divulged to him about her in their conversations.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, mama, don't traumatize us like that," Estee added, though Tay was already giggling beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well!" Agatha announced, clapping her hands together. "If we are all going to share a meal, shall we relocate to the dining room?" She flourished a hand in the general direction of the kitchen and while there were still dark circles beneath her eyes, the blue in her irises had found a renewed brightness. "Are we feeling wine or whiskey with dinner?"
    </p>
<p>
     All at once, Rio and Dave chose to call for wine while the girls, the devious little creatures they were, called for whiskey. Agatha had announced she would grab both, but that she was siding with the girls that night.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee shuffled over to help her collect glasses and delivered them to the table so that Agatha was able to pour everyone a glass of their choice. As she sat at the head of the table with Rio and Dave on either side of her and the girls lining the table next to Rio, Agatha's eyes fell to her whiskey. There was the smallest, almost imperceptible, twitch of Agatha's lips before she took hold of the glass and raised it.
    </p>
<p>
     "To Vogue," she offered, her gaze casting to her wife in a show of silent appreciation.
    </p>
<p>
     "To Vogue!" everyone else returned, the soft 'clinks' of glasses sounding at the toast before everyone began to feast on the meal that Dave had provided for them.
    </p>
<p>
     The conversation had initially begun as small talk and then had moved onto the honeymoon, which the girls had been eager to hear about as well. However, it took that long-awaited turn toward what awaited the two of them that Friday afternoon.
    </p>
<p>
     Dave wiped at his mouth and set his napkin on the table, dark eyes landing on Rio, though the expression he chose was somehow... calming. It was because he knew what he was doing in how he was choosing to navigate this new facet of Rio's life.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know this is new for you, but I also know that she is going to hold your hand through it. You both need to be there by 9:30 that morning for hair and makeup and the interview will begin at 11:30." He sat back in his chair, lips twisting in consideration for a moment before he continued. "I have selected three outfits for each of you that will be sent over for the photoshoot that will follow the interview. And do not fret, I had some help."
    </p>
<p>
     The moment he glanced at the girls, they were giggling again though they tried to stifle the sounds before they could draw any heat from Agatha or Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "But, all-in-all, you should be headed out no later than 3. So... Please make sure to eat something before you head over. I imagine," he voiced, looking back to Rio, that same kindness filling his expression, "the nerves might be next level, but trust that she will guide you through it. She might have already done it a time or twenty."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand found Rio's on the corner of the table and gave it a comforting squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     "He's right. It'll seem like a lot, but... Depending on who we get, it might just feel like talking to an old friend," she explained. Rio knew she wasn't minimizing anything but was rather trying to offer a frame of mind that this could be comforting as opposed to terrifying.
    </p>
<p>
     "Per the last email I got, it's between Alana Sharpe or Caprice Bourdain. I have heard nothing but delightful things about both of them from other contacts, so it should be an easy day," Dave informed them, his eyes landing on Agatha, a twitch happening just above his eyebrow that indicated he might have known something no one else did.
    </p>
<p>
     "Can you push for Caprice?" Agatha asked him, her head tipping back as if she were trying to establish some authority. The requestion piqued Rio's interest and she eyed Dave instantly for an answer, already knowing Agatha would try to be dismissive.
    </p>
<p>
     Dave's lips split, a soft chuckle escaping through his grin. "Alana... Maybe has a thing for Agatha. And has for a... very long time," he offered, but as he was explaining, Agatha's grip tightened around Rio's hand subtly.
    </p>
<p>
     "She's nice," Agatha attempted, but she didn't sell it well enough to convince Rio to buy.
    </p>
<p>
     "But?" Rio pressed, thumb absentmindedly brushing over Agatha's hand in her grasp.
    </p>
<p>
     "She's... a lot. And... Caprice is a lot funnier anyway. So," she stated decidedly, looking back up at Dave. "If there's absolutely any way you can make that happen, it would be greatly appreciated."
    </p>
<p>
     "You got it, boss," he returned, raising a hand to deliver a mock salute that only caused Agatha to roll her eyes while the girls, making sound for the first time since the heavier part of the conversation had begun, dissolved into more laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't you have a husband and clean dogs to get home to?" Agatha grumbled at him, reaching for her whiskey to toss back the remainder of it.
    </p>
<p>
     "I suppose I do. I guess I was just... shockingly... enjoying my time with you. But silly me, it was probably just the wife and daughters that had me lulled into contentment," he teased her, pushing himself off the table to rise to his feet.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thanks for tea, Dave!" Estee gushed with a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     "Anytime, ladies. All of you have a good night, yeah? If you need anything in the meantime, you know how to reach me." He offered a light wave and started to make his way to the door, but he stopped about halfway and turned, his eyes dropping to where Rio sat toward the end of the table. "And Rio... It's going to be okay. Trust us and it'll get you through it, yeah?"
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, Dave," she replied, her voice sweet and smile kind.
    </p>
<p>
     He waved his hand in one last gesture of his parting and let himself out the front door, leaving the four woman sat at that grand dining room table, the remnants of their meals all shoved into the sack they had arrived in.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a heavy and still silence that started to settle, but it was something that Estee was not going to let happen.
    </p>
<p>
     "So I downloaded JackBox party packs to my Xbox and I think that we should each have another glass and play for a couple of hours. Just something silly and fun, you know?" she posed, grabbing her glass so that she could drain the last of it.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know what," Agatha voiced, catching Rio a little off guard. "I think that sounds like an amazing idea, actually. If you want, you can hook it up down here and we can play on the big TV."
    </p>
<p>
     Both Estee and Tay's expressions brightened in an instant.
    </p>
<p>
     "Really?!" Estee questioned back, voice hiked in her surprise. It was clear that she had not actually thought the suggestion would lead anywhere, but as Agatha nodded her confirmation, Estee was on her feet and pulling Tay up so they could collect the console from their bedroom.
    </p>
<p>
     Once they had disappeared up the stairs, Rio let her gaze fall to her wife, but once more, Agatha was heading her off before she found the right thing to say.
    </p>
<p>
     "A puzzle is still a full picture even when a piece is lost. The piece will get found. Shouldn't make the entire view any less grand."
    </p>
<p>
     It was moments like that when Agatha said the most profound things that Rio was left wondering just how it was her sitting there, absorbing that kind of wisdom from a woman who had likely only found such a thing since they had met.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're right," Rio agreed, leaning forward over the corner so that she could place a delicate kiss to her wife's lips. "We can still enjoy the sights we have and know they'll get even better soon enough."
    </p>
<p>
     "Small blessings," Agatha offered, the corners of her lips tugging up slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Small blessings, my love."

</p>
<p>
     While life had yet to return to normal and a piece was still missing from the Harkness-Vidal household, it
     <em>
      had
     </em>
     started to garner a little more regularity with each day that passed.
    </p>
<p>
     It came from the couple of trips Rio and Agatha had both taken to Agatha's office while she slipped back into the throes of her career.
    </p>
<p>
     It came from the few nights that Rio and Agatha sat out back with the string lights on and the girls across the patio table from them, chatting and laughing until they all tucked in to sleep.
    </p>
<p>
     It came from the mornings Rio would bring Agatha her coffee in bed while she was still fighting to greet the day.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Nicky was still thousands of miles away sorting through his own pain and emotion, but Agatha still thought of him, even going through the motions. Rio could see it in the way she would sometimes catch Agatha looking at photos of him when he was younger. It was in the way Agatha would casually inquire with Estee on if she had heard from him. Agatha did not grovel, did not ask Estee to pass on any message to Nicky. She just wanted to know he was okay.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was letting him have his time.
    </p>
<p>
     She was growing, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew it was hard, knew that Agatha was struggling, and they often unpacked at night as they snuggled in to prepare for slumber. They talked about the way Agatha was feeling, what she was going to do moving forward and how she had every intention of being as honest with Nicky as was possible moving forward. There were still things he should not know, sure, but those items ran on the same list as 'Things Absolutely No One Other Than Rio Should Know About Agatha Ever.'
    </p>
<p>
     Still, every night, Rio would trace her fingertips up Agatha's back and whisper into her hair that they were a little closer to things being okay again, even if it didn't feel like it yet.
    </p>
<p>
     Thursday night, it was Rio's turn to develop those live-wired nerves that caused her to feel as though nothing but electricity was running through her veins. It was stupid; she had been offered comfort in regards to their venture the next day, from Agatha and Dave both. They were both well aware that this was an entirely new world for Rio, something she was just being thrust into.
    </p>
<p>
     Dave had stated a couple of times that they should consider the tiniest bit of media training for her, but Agatha had been dismissive of the idea each instance.
    </p>
<p>
     "She'll be fine. I'm going to be right next to her," she told him again and again. He seemed dissatisfied with such an answer, but it was as though it stemmed more from concern than anything else.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio hoped Agatha was right. Mostly because she didn't exactly understand what the fuck 'media training' even was, exactly. Surely, that was a problem, but Agatha was not treating it as one so Rio had decided to show it the same respect.
    </p>
<p>
     She had almost asked Agatha, a couple of times, to explain it to her and break it down like she was a five-year-old, but it felt a little too embarrassing. Something in Rio simply wanted to rise to the challenge, to prove to Agatha that she could fit into her life as well as Agatha had so seamlessly fit into Rio's.
    </p>
<p>
     In spite of her nerves, Rio had managed to catch a few hours of sleep, though she woke before the sun started to rise. For those first drowsy morning minutes, she laid on her back and stared at the ceiling, listening to the soft sounds of her wife's intermittent snoring.
    </p>
<p>
     The day was upon them. They had put their story on display for the fifty or so people that had attended their wedding. Now, it was time to show it to the world.
    </p>
<p>
     Never before in her life would Rio had ever envisioned living through any series of experiences that would have put her where she was. Only a year ago, her life had been coasting, just sailing along a predetermined path that held complacency and routine. It had been a comfort to know that the life she had been living was the life she would continue to lead. But... That wasn't how life itself worked, was it?
    </p>
<p>
     All it had taken was a little incompetence on Agatha's part and a mild hero complex on Rio's for things to change forever.
    </p>
<p>
     And now, they were about to try and explain that to the masses.
    </p>
<p>
     The restlessness began to creep in and Rio carefully peeled herself from bed to go about her morning routine before heading to the kitchen to put on a pot of coffee. As she stood with her back to the counter, arms wrapped loosely around her middle, Rio's eyes fell to the front windows and the soft orange hues that were beginning to spill in.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a beginning, one to a day she had never, in her wildest dreams, been able to see coming.
    </p>
<p>
     It was her chance to step up, to prove that she was worthy of being the woman on the arm of the Wild Witch of Hollywood. In her bones, she knew it was stupid. She didn't have to prove anything to anyone, least of all the court of public opinion, but something in her couldn't help but want to make Agatha proud. Time and time again, Agatha had made concessions and done things to benefit Rio's life and sense of well being. All Rio wanted to do now was return the favor.
    </p>
<p>
     The discomfort had been rising, but it seemed with each sip of coffee she took from her spot perched on her chair at the dining room table, it started to wane. It steadied the trembling of her hands, brought Rio back into a reality where this was absolutely something she was capable of doing.
    </p>
<p>
     If all else failed, she knew she could simply keep quiet and let Agatha do the majority of the talking. This, after all, was Agatha's realm to rule over, and Rio now understood a bit better that she could do so with an iron fist.
    </p>
<p>
     In something close to a trance-like state, Rio had been staring out those front windows at the acres of yard when a voice snapped her back to reality.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mmm, I smell coffee," came Agatha's melodic but still sleepy tones.
    </p>
<p>
     As she looked over, Rio nearly melted at the softness of the sight before her. Agatha was wrapped in one of her favorite robes, hair a mess and was using a hand to dig the sleep out of an eye with her knuckle. She was bathed in those orange tones that streamed through the windows, looking every bit the angel Rio knew her capable of being.
    </p>
<p>
     The rest of the world might always call her a witch, but Rio knew the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha Harkness-Vidal would be salvation for those who loved her.
    </p>
<p>
     That was the most important part.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's still hot," Rio offered, watching Agatha with a soft smile as she made her approach.
    </p>
<p>
     "Just like my wife," Agatha teased, leaning down to steal a good morning kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, so the plan's to butter me up to shake the nerves?" Rio jabbed back with a chuckle that she drowned in a sip of coffee a moment later as Agatha departed to fix a cup of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're still nervous? Like... On a scale of manageable to vibrating out of your skin... Where are we falling currently?" Agatha inquired, though her back was to Rio who had turned around in her chair to watch the small act of domesticity that could be found in a morning routine.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio chuckled, downing another pull of the coffee before she answered. "The vibrating has quelled a bit with the help of coffee. I just... Don't want to fuck up, I guess. So... Probably closer to a mild annoyance than all else."
    </p>
<p>
     In her gliding, Agatha was near silent to a point where Rio did not even realize she had made her approach until she was sliding into her chair at the head of the table, spoon still in her mug.
    </p>
<p>
     "That's understandable," Agatha offered, tilting her head in assessment. "But... I know you, and I know how this experience is going go, barring any insane twists or turns, and I know that you are more than capable of reading social cues and understanding appropriate content to discuss." She raised her mug, taking a measured sip as she secured a finger around the handle of the spoon to keep it still.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh," Rio voiced, her lips curling in the smallest smirk. "So mentioning that time you fucked me senseless over the railing of the houseboat deck is a no-no then?" Even though she hadn't started laughing, it was painfully obvious that Rio was on the verge of breaking, even before Agatha's eyes flashed for the briefest second.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know if I'm amazed at the brazen suggestion or pissed at you for making me think about that before I've finished my first coffee," Agatha commented, and while she might have been trying to be menacing, Rio still felt Agatha's foot beneath the table as it graced up the back of her calf.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're only pissed because there's no houseboat here for a repeat," Rio teased back, leaning forward to steal a kiss that tasted of sugar and cream more than it did coffee.
    </p>
<p>
     "And not enough time in today, unfortunately," Agatha mused sadly before she relaxed back into her chair, still cradling her mug in her palms. Her eyes lifted from the liquid inside and found her wife's gaze, the most tender smile pushing her cheeks up. "You're going to be amazing. You know how I know?"
    </p>
<p>
     At this, Rio's head was the one to tilt, green eyes searching Agatha's face for any clue despite already knowing what she was going to say. So, she stayed silent and tipped her head in encouragement.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because all you have to do is be you. It gets the job done every time." Agatha raised her coffee, taking a sip, though her eyes flickered back to Rio before she lowered it again. "Just try not to over think. We're just having a conversation with someone who's friendly. Dave texted me at 5am to tell me that we did, in fact, get Caprice. So... I think you will like her. Very... Professional but with a sense of humor."
    </p>
<p>
     "Does that man ever sleep?" Rio questioned with a laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "I've never asked because I am not sure I want to know the answer."
    </p>
<p>
     "Fair enough," Rio mused. She finished the rest of her coffee and gave Agatha's leg a gentle nudge so that she could stand to rinse the mug. Before she departed, though, she leaned over and stole a light kiss. As she stood up and shuffled to the kitchen, her chin tucked over her shoulder as she called to her wife. "You know what I think might help soothe the nerves?"
    </p>
<p>
     "What might that be, my love?" Agatha questioned from her place still at the head of the table.
    </p>
<p>
     "If you come shower with me before we go."
    </p>
<p>
     Like clockwork, Agatha was slamming back her coffee and scrambling to her feet before Rio even reached the base of the stairs.
    </p>
<p>
     Some things should never change. That was one of them.
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     By 9:30, Rio lifted her chin as high as she could manage while still looking natural as she strode into the towering building that housed the Vogue offices inside, her fingers hooked tightly around Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
     By 9:45, they were sipping at the coffees they had gotten with their breakfast sandwiches on the way to the office while different woman busied themselves by treating and styling their hair.
    </p>
<p>
     By 10:50, they were still chattering back and forth happily between themselves as well as the stylists, but the focus had shifted to makeup instead. The two women tasked with getting them camera ready were a delight to converse with and the room had been filled with little more than giggles throughout their time spent within it.
    </p>
<p>
     By 11:20, Rio and Agatha were alone again, waiting to be fetched to join Caprice for their interview. Rio swiveled in her place as the door shut behind the two other women, taking in the sight of Agatha in the chair mere feet away.
    </p>
<p>
     They had chosen their own interview outfits after minor protest from Dave. Agatha informed him that he had deciding choice in every photoshoot look and so, the choice for the interview was theirs. Even despite their newly founded tradition of choosing something for one another, this time they chose for themselves and it was clearly a bright idea.
    </p>
<p>
     In that chair, hair cascading down her back in messy loose waves, Agatha looked like royalty. She looked like nothing short of a
     <em>
      goddamn queen
     </em>
     and Rio absolutely would have groveled at her feet. The way she exuded beauty and confidence in that baby blue and white pinstripe button down with the navy blazer over it and the slacks to match? Rio's knees felt weak and she hadn't even given thought to the act of standing up.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was a sight in her own right. The emerald blazer on Rio's frame over the black camisole she had on was a stunning pop of color that threw a very stark but cool contrast against Agatha's blues. Her own legs were clad in chic black trousers and pointed toed heels that were a similar color to her blazer poked from beneath the hem.
    </p>
<p>
     Although they landed on one another at the same time, Rio's declaration came first.
    </p>
<p>
     "My love," she gushed, her grin sweeping cleanly across her features. "I've seen you in that before, but right now..." There was a mysticism to her tone, a wonder that often befell her in the quieter moments. "You look incredible."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's smile was so impossibly wide that it wrinkled the corners of her eyes deeply, clearly finding appreciation in her own view.
    </p>
<p>
     "And you? A vision," Agatha declared, reaching forward to hold her hand out, a seemingly common request.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio slipped her fingers into Agatha's palm, though, she realized it was much more than that by the way Agatha's fingertips brushed over the still-healing script imbued upon her wrist.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you the nervous one now?" Rio inquired softly, giving Agatha's hand a light squeeze. Maybe she could have left it alone, but Rio could see that tiny shimmering of uncertainty in those breathtakingly blue eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not... nervous, per say," Agatha responded, her lips pressing for a moment. "I just... There will likely be questions about my... rather sordid past. And while I know Caprice will absolutely be tasteful, I just..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha, my love," Rio soothed, encasing Agatha's hand in both of her own. "I meant what I have said in the past. If everything you have told me is everything I need to know, no question that gets asked is going to unsettle me."
    </p>
<p>
     "It is," Agatha tried to rush, but Rio tightened her grip to calm her first.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know. I do. So... what I said still stands to reason. You have entrusted me with the most vulnerable parts of you, and I handle them with respect. Nothing that woman says or doesn't say will change that." Rio lifted Agatha's hand to her lips, kissing at her knuckles lovingly. She lowered it down into her lap and looked Agatha dead-on in the eyes. "I love you, Agatha. And... Well... Sorry about your luck, but I'm pretty sure it's never going to change."
    </p>
<p>
     Even though she knew she shouldn't have, with their fresh layer of makeup on, Agatha leaned forward and pressed her lips to Rio's in a chaste but sweet kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's lips parted to form a response but her eyes cast over Rio's shoulder as someone opened the door behind her, a dapper looking gentleman with his light hair slicked back in a way that did not look entirely pretentious.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ladies, we're ready for you. If you'd please follow me," he requested, standing back so he could hold the door open for them. Once in the hall, he led them down a few doorways to turn down another hallway, pacing another thirty or so feet until he opened the door he had been in search of. He held it again, gesturing for them to enter.
    </p>
<p>
     As they stepped inside, the room was positively filled with light from the large arched windows on the far brick wall, ones that were nearly as call as the vaulted ceilings. It felt like stepping into a completely different world, one that did not exist inside that plain looking office building. It was furnished with a couch, a couple of plush chairs and a few end tables that all sat atop a tufted white rug.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio couldn't help but admire the smaller touches, like the tiny pot of chicks and hens on one of the end tables, or the monstera in the corner. On another end table, there were a few cans of San Pellegrino -- something Rio would not be touching with a ten foot pole -- and a pitcher of water with glasses; it was likely a sign they would be there for a bit. Overall, it was a space meant to offer a comfortability that was conducive to opening up, to being willing to talk. Rio had never been the most forthcoming person in the world, but in that space with Agatha right next to her? It might be a bit easier to speak than she had been telling herself it would be.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been a woman already in the room, one that got to her feet the moment she heard them enter. When the turned to face them, a bright smile parted her full lips, red in color. Her eyes were a dark almond color but they were kind, friendly and a compliment to the almost-but-not-quite copper hair that fell down just past her shoulders. She looked both professional and comfortable in her white blouse that was spotted in tiny blue polka dots and her dark gray trousers.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hand reached forward as she approached them, her demeanor rather... disarming, if Rio had to give a name to it. "Good morning, ladies!" she greeted.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good morning, Caprice," Agatha returned, meeting the outstretched offering with a firm handshake. The woman then turned her attention to Rio before diving into any further pleasantries.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good morning," Rio chimed, giving her hand a light shake as well. As the contact separated, Caprice took a step back and gestured to indicate the white sofa that had been awaiting their arrival.
    </p>
<p>
     "Please, make yourselves comfortable," Caprice informed them as she returned to the space she had been occupying before they had entered.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio dropped into a passenger mindset pretty quickly, letting Agatha be the one to lead her forward across the room. Their arrangement on the couch wasn't overt, but in the spaces they
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     be touching -- knees, thighs, hips -- they were. The moment they were both comfortable, Agatha did not hesitate to pick up Rio's hand, weaving their fingers together out of habit.
    </p>
<p>
     "So," Caprice began as she lifted her phone from the end table beside her. She looked up to Rio and offered a kind smile, one that would hopefully ward her from any nerves that might be remaining.
    </p>
<p>
     Honestly? It kind of worked.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm sure Agatha has probably explained how this is going to go, but I'll do a light reiteration. I'm going to record," she indicated by giving a light wave of her phone, "but I will also be taking notes. Mister Rhys over there," this time, she gestured over her shoulder to a man in the back of the room at a table, fiddling with the camera in his hands, "will just be taking candid shots for about the first fifteen minutes. Otherwise, no more photos until afterward."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio gave a nod of understanding. However, before Caprice could continue on, Agatha leaned over, calling to the photographer.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, Rhys! My right side is my better one!"
    </p>
<p>
     When the man lifted his head, Rio's face filled with an immediate grin.
    </p>
<p>
     It was Rhys Landon, someone who had been present at the very wedding that had sparked this entire instance in the first place. She knew that he was a publication photographer, and maybe even something at the very root of Rio's brain had
     <em>
      known
     </em>
     it was Vogue, but it had simply slipped her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     "You got it!" he called with an amused grin before he returned back to the work in his hands.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Agatha had known he was going to be there, maybe she hadn't, but for Rio? Seeing him was like a comfort she hadn't known she needed. He was friendly, he was comfort. He was a sense of familiarity in a brand new world that was still so very unknown for her. Of course, she knew to keep it professional, but just seeing him there offered her a sliver of peace she might not have had otherwise.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ah," Caprice mused with a tickled chuckle. "You're acquainted already, then?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rhys' head lifted again and while Rio and Agatha could both see the smirk on his lips that seemed to heavily indicate that he had not divulged his own presence at their wedding, they both knew the woman before them could not. To stave off any unnecessary inquiries, both Rio and Agatha maintained a placidity while seemingly focused on Caprice.
    </p>
<p>
     "Friends of his dad's," Agatha sold in a half truth but this only seemed to entertain Caprice further.
    </p>
<p>
     After another moment of Rhys assembling what he needed, he informed Caprice that he was ready and she could begin at her leisure. She turned back toward Rio and Agatha offered them one last opportunity for any questions of their own.
    </p>
<p>
     "Anything else you'd like to know before we begin?" she posed sweetly, shifting a bit in her seat to get more comfortable.
    </p>
<p>
     "Actually, yeah," Rio piped up, causing Agatha's head to whip to the side in surprised, but Rio was already donning a grin. When Caprice tilted her head in answer, Rio simply couldn't help herself. "How mad was the other journalist when you got the piece?"
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately, Caprice broke out in an ear-to-ear grin and her laughter bubbled out of her in nothing more than sheer instinct. It lasted only a moment, but as she made her recovery, her eyes dropped to Agatha. "It makes sense already and you've been here all of ten minutes."
    </p>
<p>
     "You will find," Agatha advised the journalist, "that this one is filled with surprises."
    </p>
<p>
     Caprice's expression cinched momentarily in understanding, but she slipped back into that professional front with ease. "Alright, well. Easy questions, just... I know we're not friends, but for the next couple of hours we can be if it makes you feel more comfortable. All we want to know is what makes the two of you what you are and how you got here. Easy as pie, I promise."
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio did not know right then, but would be informed of later that night, was that the respect Caprice was building the more she helped walk Rio through this was paramount to the emotions Agatha kept toward the press the majority of the time. Agatha already knew how this worked, so the gentle showing was simply derived from Caprice's read on the situation and whatever small briefing Dave may have given her beforehand.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you," Rio informed her, giving a firm nod to indicate she was ready.
    </p>
<p>
     Caprice gave her own nod, one of acknowledgement while still smiling, and held up her phone to inform them that she was going to begin the interview. She pressed a button on the screen and set it down on the end table next to her, picking up the pen that was laying next to it so she could poise it over the notebook propped on her crossed leg.
    </p>
<p>
     She made the introductions for the sake of the audio recording and turn turned her attention fully to them, the utter warmth radiating outward in her demeanor.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why don't we start from the beginning, the best place to start? How did the two of you meet?" she questioned, dark gaze casting between the two of them to show that it was an inquiry either of them could answer.
    </p>
<p>
     In response, they simply glanced at each other to see who should take the lead and the moment their eyes met, they simply cracked into grins. They tried to contain their laughter knowing that they needed to treat this as a professional showing, though in happenings such as that, it wasn't the easiest feat. Just over Caprice's shoulder, Rhys was already hard at work, snapping such delicate moments of nerves and joy.
    </p>
<p>
     "You go first," Rio prompted, shifting her knee to lightly nudge Agatha's, punctuating her statement.
    </p>
<p>
     Still grinning like a damn fool, Agatha tore those dancing blue eyes away to focus them on the woman on the other side of the rug.
    </p>
<p>
     "Well..." Agatha began, her thumb subconsciously brushing over the backs of Rio's knuckles as she began arranging the words in the right order, preparing to put them on the record. "
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     personally was not having the best day. A boardroom meeting had me a little out of sorts when I was on a trip for a new project. It left me wandering around Auckland, New Zealand in the middle of the day mad as hell." Agatha paused, giving her head a slight shake as she breathed the quickest chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     "I was on the phone with a friend, griping about what I had been dealing with and had not been paying attention to where I was going. I apparently was not paying attention to the shouting happening around me, either," Agatha recalled, unable to keep that silly smile off of her face each time she glanced at the woman who's hand she as holding. "The only thing I heard clearly was a wolf whistle as I was crossing a bridge over the marina."
    </p>
<p>
     Caprice looked completely rapt, as if realizing what audible gold she was collecting before she even got to the best parts.
    </p>
<p>
     "I looked up, and across the water, there were a couple of houseboats. On the deck of one, there was a woman who looked like she'd just been lounging waving me down. When I went to acknowledge her, someone on a bike hit me hard enough that I lost my balance and fell over the railing."
    </p>
<p>
     While she had been intent on letting the two of them tell their story, as someone who had at least a miniscule history with Agatha, Caprice's eyes widened and her hand stopped moving so that she could sit up a bit more.
    </p>
<p>
     "Into the water?!" she questioned.
    </p>
<p>
     "Right into it," Agatha answered, glancing over at Rio with that bright curling of her lips. She looked back to Caprice and forged onward. "Launched my phone, was drenched... I was... not happy, but I swam over to climb out. I let her pull me onto the deck of her houseboat, and then she politely informed me that I had been walking in the bike lane."
    </p>
<p>
     There were very pointed signs that the journalist before them was fighting for her life to maintain professionalism. Perhaps she had been expecting a story about a random exchange at a bar, or a chance meeting in a market. Never could the two of them have been so tame.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead of continuing, Agatha gently tugged on Rio's hand and gripped at it lightly, giving her the permission to pick it up and run with it.
    </p>
<p>
     This was it. The time to put up or shut up.
    </p>
<p>
     "I had been reading on my deck that afternoon after an otherwise boring day when I heard shouting. It's not all that uncommon, as the bikers around the city are a lively bunch. But... when I looked up, I saw why. I tried to get her attention, but the timing was poor, obviously," Rio explained, that peculiar accent thickening over her words in her nerves, though she was doing a decent enough job of holding her own.
    </p>
<p>
     "When I pulled her out, I felt a bit guilty, even though I knew it wasn't my fault. Even more guilty when I realized I dropped my own phone while trying to help her out of the water." A slightly sheepish look washed over her expression in a flash, but in the next moment it disappeared. "So... I offered to dry her clothes for her so she could get on about her day. Which would have seemed like a normal and reasonable offer, but --"
    </p>
<p>
     "But her dryer hadn't been updated since the prehistoric ages and total run time was roughly three hours," Agatha interjected with a laugh that caused nothing but amusement to write itself on the other woman's face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, that. So she showered and we wound up on the deck with wine," Rio explained. Although she wasn't aware of it, her free hand had shifted so that her fingertips could drag the softest lines back and forth over the length of Agatha's forearm. "We sat on the deck for hours, just... talking. About life, our children, and existentialism like we were discussing the weather."
    </p>
<p>
     "Then she even cooked for me," Agatha nearly gushed.
    </p>
<p>
     There was this expression that flickered over the woman's face. It didn't last long, but Rio had seen it. It was almost... confusion, but seemed more perplexed again. Something in Rio understood what it meant. This woman, Caprice, had surely had her encounters with Agatha before. She knew far more about Agatha's past than Rio did, and therefore had probably curated an idea of Agatha, same as the rest of the world.
    </p>
<p>
     For decades, Agatha had been the queen of Hollywood. She had pushed production after production, leaving trails of sobbing interns in her wake. She had won award after award. She had
     <em>
      four fucking Oscars
     </em>
     and she had just turned fifty. Agatha had built herself an impossibly prolific career, and to do that she had always shown her claws and bared her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     This journalist was witnessing something no one else had before.
    </p>
<p>
     The Wild Witch had finally been tamed.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's fingers tightened in their hold around Agatha's hand and she glanced over, as if asking for silent permission to progress with the story. They both knew what was coming next. It was something that would tell the world just how impossibly soft Agatha Harkness-Vial
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     be, given the right circumstances.
    </p>
<p>
     Their eyes met and for the briefest showing, Rio caught sight of the apprehension that flickered through Agatha like a dimming flame. Then, Agatha offered her the most tender smile and dipped her chin to urge Rio on.
    </p>
<p>
     Bright green eyes lifted, landing on Caprice again as Rio picked back up from where Agatha had left off. "We ate, talked more, drank more. It was just... peaceful. By the time it had gotten dark and we finished eating, I knew it was likely that her clothes were dry. We went inside to check, and I was right. But then..." Rio hesitated, unable to keep herself from looking at Agatha again, a welling softness overtaking her that was scribed in nearly every muscle of her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Rhys was not missing a second of it, as they would later find out.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's palm cupped over Agatha's arm and fingertip pressed lightly into muscle before she tore her eyes away to finish what she had been saying.
    </p>
<p>
     "Then, Agatha took the glass of water she had been drinking and she threw it inside. She closed the door, pressed the button and looked me right in the eye when she told me they needed more time."
    </p>
<p>
     Caprice was clearly putting forth the most valiant effort toward remaining stoic and impartial, but something about this was getting to her. It was in the most minute shifts, the tiniest micro expressions. Rio didn't know what they meant, but she knew they were there for a reason.
    </p>
<p>
     "We ended up watching a documentary and I fell asleep," Agatha picked up, her free hand landing on top of Rio's to sandwich it against her forearm. "And the next morning when I woke up..." Agatha's lips twitched and she glanced at Rio for a beat before pressing forth. "She was making breakfast that I knew I couldn't stay for. I knew that my assistant was likely losing his mind with no contact. The friend I had been on the phone with was probably terrified. I needed to put out those fires as soon as possible."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha stopped for a moment and cleared her throat, sitting up a little straighter. She was feeling vulnerable and so she had to square those shoulders to remind the journalist who, exactly, she was having this conversation with.
    </p>
<p>
     It didn't work. Caprice had already seen too much to believe it was little more than a defensive tactic.
    </p>
<p>
     "So, I got dressed in the dry clothes she had left folded for me and I went out to greet her and then say my goodbyes. Which... Maybe it would have been normal if we were anyone else, but..."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn't sure when it had happened, but she had completely torn her attention away from the woman they were speaking to and instead had become fixated on Agatha, knowing exactly what she was about to say and how it still sometimes made her feel.
    </p>
<p>
     "But?" Caprice pressed, clearly in the thick of it now.
    </p>
<p>
     "But... When I went to thank her and offer farewells, I realized that I..." Agatha's lips pressed for a moment, but she continued. "I realized I did not know her name. And..."
    </p>
<p>
     "And I panicked," Rio supplemented, tearing her eyes away from her wife, though they still sat woven with hands in hands and on arms and hands, a tangle of comfort and support. "I turned the sentiment back on her and... We accidently set a precedent that we didn't mean to."
    </p>
<p>
     "And I left without knowing her name."
    </p>
<p>
     Caprice's eyes had gone wide and there was the tiniest bit of slack in her jaw, as though she could not actually believe what it was she was hearing. She wanted to press, and Agatha apparently noticed because she spoke again.
    </p>
<p>
     "And I did not go back."
    </p>
<p>
     The woman's red lips turned down at the corners; she was invested, and while she obviously knew that was nowhere near the end of the story, she was still showing the effects of what a wild ride their very beginnings actually were.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not true," Rio countered, nudging her softly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Right, right," Agatha offered. "I did go back. And she wasn't home."
    </p>
<p>
     This seemed to pain the other woman, who's free hand flew up to land on her chest, as if she had actually been struck by what a travesty that was.
    </p>
<p>
     "I had no paper, no pen. I didn't even have a business card on me. But what I did have was an earring. So... I took it off, put the back on it and hung it on the post at the end of the dock to the houseboat. I knew it was a hail Mary, and that it was idiotic, but... Something made me do it." There was this beautiful cadence of conviction in Agatha's tone, this warm winding of how invested she was into their not-so-humble beginnings and what it meant to her to be telling someone in such a setting.
    </p>
<p>
     "I found it the same night but I... was not so quick to catch on. In fact... I figured she lost it and someone had simply pinned it there to be found. I spent... the next couple of weeks with it tucked in my jewelry box." Rio's expression softened a little, her thumb brushing softly over Agatha's arm. She cleared her throat and resumed. "I had told my daughter, who was twenty-one at the time, about what had happened. When she came home on her break, we talked about it briefly but otherwise just tried to enjoy our time together. Which, we did. And she... The genius she is, she left it alone right up until I was taking her to the airport so she could go back to uni."
    </p>
<p>
     "I feel like 'genius' is really underselling it sometimes," Agatha added with a brief look to Rio, a familiar grin pushing up her cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
     "In that conversation, I told her about the earring. I was insistent it was just something that was lost, that it meant nothing. Then..." Rio stalled, unable to keep herself from grinning at this particular memory. "Then, she asked me a question that made me realize it meant
     <em>
      everything.
     </em>
     She asked me if the back was still on the earring. And... It was."
    </p>
<p>
     As Rio really focused on her, she could see that the woman before them was trying not to absolutely melt. They knew what this was, what it sounded like. It was sheer insanity but in the most romantic way, and it had found roots in being emotionally moving.
    </p>
<p>
     "It took me a little bit of time, but with some convincing from who Agatha likes to call 'the greatest wing-woman in the world,' I booked a flight for LA with nothing more than an office address in my pocket."
    </p>
<p>
     Though she had been completely taken in by their story, Caprice seemed to snap back into the moment to realize that she was actually at work, doing her job, and she
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     have a loose guideline of questions that should be asked.
    </p>
<p>
     "So you hopped on a plane just like that? And... How exactly did that go?" she probed, her pen hesitating above her notebook.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's instant reaction at the memory of arguing with the security guard was to do little more than laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am pretty sure her security guy was ready to call the police on me," Rio divulged. "So... I gave up. I wrote her a note with a name she didn't know, an out-of-country phone number and, in some form of blind hope, I drew the
     <em>
      worst
     </em>
     little boat as if it might have been an obvious showing that some insane woman had flown thousands of miles for one more second of her time."
    </p>
<p>
     "And it worked?" Caprice questioned, her eyes shifting to Agatha this time.
    </p>
<p>
     "It didn't have to," Agatha answered, her smile returning immediately. "When she was leaving, I was coming back. And I... saw her at the top of the stairs. And it was the strangest mix of feelings. It felt like I was being electrocuted, sedated, and had been on a four day bender all at the same time. And the only thing I was physically capable of in those moments was just... Going to her."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio offered the softest giggle at recanting the memory.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was magnetic. I was moving at the same time she was and we met at the bottom of the stairs. She had kissed me before she left my home that day... But that kiss, at the bottom of the stairs to her office... That one was the first one of the rest of our lives." She could have kissed Agatha right then, but she was reminding herself that it was important to stay professional.
    </p>
<p>
     "And what was it like for you, Agatha? Seeing her there when you probably didn't think you'd ever see her again?" Caprice asked, poising her pen again.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel Agatha soften beside her.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was... Surreal. I... Had not been able to take my mind off that trip, and that night. I'd just spent lunch with the friend I had been on the phone with talking about her. And I..." Agatha laughed. It wasn't just a chuckle, but instead a brighter and more amused sound. "All I knew to call her was 'Boat Woman.' And then... There was Boat Woman, standing in front of my office. So... Naturally, I had to spend the next week with her."
    </p>
<p>
     "Or, you know... the next... almost nine months?" Rio offered back, grinning from ear to ear.
    </p>
<p>
     Caprice's focus fell to Rio as she pressed on with another question.
    </p>
<p>
     "Before that day... What did life look like for you?"
    </p>
<p>
     This, for some reason, made Rio shift around uncomfortably, suddenly realizing that the main focus was on
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     and who
     <em>
      she
     </em>
     was before Agatha had tumbled into her life.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mostly tame, quiet life. I didn't keep many friends and my daughter, Estrella, was away at school. I worked a lot, on a project I have since finished. I've been programming for a little over fifteen years, but the last six or so have been spent on one project. I was... quite boring, honestly. My film collection was... severely lacking, I have come to understand. I had
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     gotten a smart phone a month before we met, per my daughter's insistence. She told me quite often I was just a step out of sync with the rest of the world. I think I understand what that means, now," Rio explained, the gentlest chuckle falling from her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "So..." Caprice started, clearly having found a segue she had been looking for. "With that dissociation, I am sure there are things you have since learned," she deduced and while she was not wrong, something about the statement caused a shiver to ripple so quickly up Rio's spine. She gave a nod despite herself. Caprice's gaze shifted to Agatha, her lips twisting uncertainly for a moment as she chose her words. "Notoriously, you have built a reputation as one of Hollywood's biggest womanizers. Which I think leaves a very popular and very fair question: What changed your mind?"
    </p>
<p>
     Both of Agatha's hands flexed, not only gripping at Rio's fingers, but her arm, too. Rio already knew this answer, as Agatha had told her in a variety of different ways, but now she was going to tell anyone who would read or listen.
    </p>
<p>
     "There are... These moments in life. They could be conversations, they could be quiet moments. They could be laughter or tears. They might only happen few and far between, but... they're beautiful. They're heart-stopping. They're swoon worth. And... When you meet someone who makes those moments happen so frequently that they become a daily occurrence... You know you have to keep them." Agatha's grip was still strong in both places she was holding onto Rio as she finished speaking.
    </p>
<p>
     They had both been so in the throes of retelling their truth that for the first time, Rio actually noticed Rhys was no longer in the room. He had heard such sentiments from Agatha at the wedding, he didn't need to hear them again anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     In a way, it almost gave Rio permission to be a little more emotional. Her eyes did glass, but tears did not spill. Hearing Agatha phrase it like that had impacted her in a way previous iterations of the same sentiment had not ever done before. It was a beautiful way to frame it, a way that made Rio realize yet again just what she meant to Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The topic turned to the engagement, then the wedding, which had taken up another good chunk of their time. After a few more questions about home life and the consistent travel schedule, Caprice thanked them both on the record and reached over to stop the recording. She closed her notebook, which now contained several full pages about the content they had discussed, and leaned forward over her knees.
    </p>
<p>
     "Off the record," she offered, a warm and genuine smile filling her lips, "that was probably one of the best interviews I have done. And I just genuinely would like to thank
     <em>
      both
     </em>
     of you," she voice, her eyes shifting to land on Agatha, "for taking the time to sit down with me and tell me your story. I know that for you, Agatha, it... probably wasn't easy."
    </p>
<p>
     "Actually, you know, it's funny that way," Agatha mused, her attention diverting to her wife as a soft tenderness filled her face. "I thought it would be hard. But..." She looked back at Caprice, her smile growing. "It turns out talking about the
     <em>
      good
     </em>
     things is pretty easy."
    </p>
<p>
     "Well, thank you again. Our portion has come to a close, but I can escort you to the studio where Rhys will be awaiting your arrival."
    </p>
<p>
     The three of them got to their feet and Rio and Agatha both met Caprice with one more firm and appreciative handshake of parting before she took them to their next destination.
    </p>
<p>
     In the hours that followed, Rio was almost certain she had never had so much fun in her life.
    </p>
<p>
     Dave had sent over three outfits for the two of them, set in pairs. The flowing black dress of Rio's that matched a white one Agatha slipped into was a perfect contrast, a showing of the duality between the two of them. The poses were elegant and poised, but there had been laughter and giggles between shots, moments that Rhys had quietly captured, as well.
    </p>
<p>
     The second pair of outfits were equally as stunning in their dichotomy. Rio's suit was red with a black printed pattern that was reminiscent of feathers that wound around it. In turn, Agatha's suit was glaringly white with a black blouse underneath. It almost felt silly to Rio, like they were playing dress up as though they were children, but she was loving every pose, every glance, every smile, and she never wanted it to end.
    </p>
<p>
     The third set of outfits had actually surprised Rio. It wasn't because it was shocking, or out of the realm of what would have been normal for them, but because it was
     <em>
      so them
     </em>
     it hurt.
    </p>
<p>
     For Agatha, it was an incredibly smart fitted purple suit, one that included a white button-down and matching purple tie. It was clean, it was sharp, and it was so very Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     On Rio's end, Dave had secured her the most beautiful emerald gown, one with a leg slit that Rio realized almost came up to her hip once she had put it on. The way Agatha had looked at her when she stepped out from behind the changing screen?
    </p>
<p>
     It had been
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     clear on her face that she was violently reminding herself where they were and what they were doing. Otherwise, Rio knew that Agatha would not have hesitated to pin her to the wall and run a hand right up that slit. Truth be told, Rio felt the same way at the sight of Agatha in that fucking suit.
    </p>
<p>
     They were so down bad for each other it was absolutely heinous.
    </p>
<p>
     That last round of photos had somehow brought with it the most joy. There were more intimate poses, them close but not quite kissing. There was one of Rio, posed so elegantly on a plush chair, looking up at an Agatha who was cradling her chin with the biggest smile on her face. Another, Agatha was sat on the ground and Rio was poised above her on a posing block, their fingers hooked together in the space between them.
    </p>
<p>
     One photo, after they had changed back into the clothing they had arrived in, Rhys had pulled them right over to preview it.
    </p>
<p>
     Chest to chest, they were looking directly at one another, their smiles so full of love and respect and adoration that it was clear and would be to anyone who saw it, even without knowing them as people.
    </p>
<p>
     That was photographic evidence that Agatha Harkness-Vidal was never going to love anyone the way she loved Rio Harkness-Vidal.
    </p>
<p>
     After a series of thank-you's that ended with embraces, the two of them were free to go about their day. Gio was already at the curb, waiting to open the door for them with a bright smile upon his lips.
    </p>
<p>
     While the mood had assuredly been jovial, there had been an internal monologue that had been quaking around inside of Agatha's head that Rio had not been privy to. It was a monologue built on watching Rio tackle a new aspect of her life head-on and with very little fear. For every bit of doubt that Rio might have been carrying with her about how she could fit into Agatha's life, Agatha had found reasons why she fit perfectly.
    </p>
<p>
     More than that, Agatha had found appeal in just how effortless Rio had made it all seem.
    </p>
<p>
     It was why the moment Gio shut the door behind Agatha and made his way to the front, Agatha's hand shot down and tugged on the button that slid the partition up in the front of the car. A moment after Gio shut the front door, louder but still muffled music sounded from the front.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could even question it, Agatha's hand was launching toward her, hooking around her neck to pull her in for a hot and starved kiss, one Agatha had likely been holding onto since they'd arrived earlier that day.
    </p>
<p>
     It was wet and needy, but it took little time for it to deepen, for Agatha's tongue to barge between Rio's lips in desperation. She didn't have to say it out loud for Rio to get it.
    </p>
<p>
     They had spent the day informing the world about how they came to be, how they fell into one another. It was something more, though, a way for Agatha to tell the world what she had and how it was hers and only hers.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would forever be hers.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, Agatha wanted to prove that point.
    </p>
<p>
     She was hasty as she broke their lips apart so that she could lift Rio up and into her lap, though Rio realized what she was doing and carefully maneuvered herself so that she could comfortably staddle Agatha's thighs, ducking her head as to not bump it against the roof of the car.
    </p>
<p>
     The idea to resume the kiss had popped up, but before she could think to do so, Rio felt Agatha's hands meet at the front of her trousers, wasting absolutely no time in getting them undone. Her focus lifted, their eyes meeting, and Rio saw little else outside of Agatha's sheer ravenous ache for Rio, for her body, for her soul.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt, as Agatha leaned up just enough to reinstate a forceful kiss, the way Agatha's soft fingertips slid down into her panties, through that familiar and coarse patch of hair to glide easily between her lips, finding the slick desire that had pooled there in the last several minutes. There was no direct contact made with her clit, but Agatha's touch was intentional in its exploration.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio whined into Agatha's mouth, her hips rocking down into the touch as if to beg for more.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You were..."
     </em>
     Agatha gasped back, though she stopped speaking long enough to kiss Rio again. Those two fingers were a teasing, constant pressure as they skated from entrance to clit and back down again, causing the pressure in Rio's belly to start to built.
     <em>
      "So fucking incredible today."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The declaration Agatha offered drew a moan from between Rio's soft lips only because it was coupled with the way she pressed those two middle right into Rio's tight and wet core. The weakness it produced in her caused her to jerk to the side, her torso tilting toward Agatha as her hand landed on Agatha's shoulder to try to support herself, though it appeared to offer little assistance.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "So smart,"
     </em>
     Agatha rasped, turning her head to pepper kisses to the side of Rio's neck that was exposed to her with the way Rio had landed against her.
     <em>
      "So witty."
     </em>
     Another few kisses paired well with the way Agatha's fingers began to pump steadily into her body.
     <em>
      "So funny."
     </em>
     When she nipped at Rio's skin this time, Rio also felt very acutely as Agatha's thumb landed directly next to her clit and then began pacing circles around it, taunting her.
     <em>
      "My wife, ever so sexy, now for the whole world to see."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio wanted it to last longer, wanted to keep working her hips against the feeling of her wife inside of her, but with the way Agatha was kissing her neck and talking to her like that, Rio knew there was little hope in trying to prolong the inevitable.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio whimpered, her face turning to land in Agatha's hair, hips still fervently bucking and rolling down in chase of release.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Come, baby,"
     </em>
     Agatha urged, running the tip of her tongue along the crook of Rio's neck in a move that almost granted her request on the spot. The words that followed seemed to seal the deal.
     <em>
      "You earned it. So come for me."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's hips rocked down the very moment Agatha's fingers curled and gripped to pull forward, tearing that debilitating orgasm right from Rio's pulsing pussy.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Ohhhhhhh, Agathaaa, fuck!"
     </em>
     Rio moaned, every limb she was in possession of trembling beyond her control. All of her weight slumped into Agatha's chest, her face falling to tuck into the warmth her neck had to offer.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mmmm, good girl,"
     </em>
     Agatha hummed, raising the hand that did not have two stick and wet fingers to lightly stroke at Rio's hair. After a pause, though, Agatha seemed to realize that the car and stopped and had not moved.
    </p>
<p>
     She reached down and pushed the button to drop the partition. "Gio? Everything okay?" she called toward the front.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course, ma'am. I was unsure if you'd want me to walk up or go through the drive thru."
    </p>
<p>
     Confused, Rio lifted her head and followed Agatha's gaze out the window.
    </p>
<p>
     He had taken them straight to the first In-N-Out he could find.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are a good fucking man, Gio."
    </p>
<p>
     Ten minutes later, through a mouth full of animal-style fries, Rio pointed out the obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     "That man deserves a raise."
    </p>

</p>
<p>
     The day of the interview had been a gift in many ways.
    </p>
<p>
     The night of the interview had been an even bigger one, in the
     <em>
      most
     </em>
     meaningful way that neither Rio nor Agatha could have seen coming.
    </p>
<p>
     Sounds of chatter as they approached the front door of the home they shared with their children were never that rare of an occurrence each time they came muffled and slightly muted by the thick wood. From a short distance, and even upon unlocking the door, it could have been assumed that the girls were inside, enjoying a Friday evening with take-out, or maybe alcohol.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pushed the door open and a deeper, bassier laugh bounced off the walls of the house. The very moment the sound touched Agatha's ears, Rio watched as she froze in place. It was a laughter that Agatha had heard evolve for two decades. It was a bright sound that had embedded its way into her brain and it was, in those ticking moments, a sound she had not been prepared to hear so soon.
    </p>
<p>
     Right behind her, Rio reached up and placed a hand to the middle of Agatha's back, right between her shoulder blades. It was probably a good thing that Agatha couldn't see her face; she was just as shocked. Rio had not been informed that Nicky had established any plans to come home, let alone that he would be there when they returned that evening.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Keep going, babe,"
     </em>
     Rio pushed in a whisper, not wanting the moment to break before it could truly begin.
    </p>
<p>
     With a sobering breath that seemed to quell that tiny tremble in her form, Agatha pressed the door open further and stepped inside, drawing an end to the clucking inside as the children realized their mothers had arrived home. The pair of them shuffled inside and before Rio could properly get a good look at the occupants of the room -- which she did gauge as being Nicky, Estee, and Tay -- Nicky was sailing across the room, careening straight toward Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was a bit more with it than her surprised wife, arms wide to receive her son as he walked straight into the awaiting embrace, his own securing tightly around his mother's shoulders. His head dipped, face landing in her still loosely styled hair as he hugged her as though he were afraid she might get even an inch away.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Hi, son,"
     </em>
     Agatha murmured, clinging right back to him and obviously not willing to let the contact end quite so soon.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I missed you, mom,"
     </em>
     he returned quietly. After another moment, his hold loosened and he pulled back, his hands landing on Agatha's biceps. As Rio watched him, just observing the moment, she could see in his eyes that he knew it was a difficult and awkward moment to navigate, but he seemed to be building his resolve.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you," he told her, giving her arm a light squeeze. "And... Thank you, for giving me what I needed. It... It really helped me realize I
     <em>
      wanted
     </em>
     to come back sooner."
    </p>
<p>
     Cautiously, both of Agatha's hands lifted and cupped her son's cheeks, her thumbs brushing tenderly beneath his eyes as she beheld him.
    </p>
<p>
     Her boy. Her son. Their son.
    </p>
<p>
     Their Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     "I just trusted you to know what's best for you, that's all," Agatha informed him, gently pulling him down toward her so that she could place a delicate kiss to his forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hēmi sends his regards and said he will be in next weekend to visit," Nicky stated, and while he was looking at Agatha, Rio knew it was for her benefit as well.
    </p>
<p>
     "You should convince him to bring some caramel Tim Tams," Rio offered with a sweet chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky gave Agatha another firm squeeze to his mother's arms and then released her, stepping to the side so that he could greet Rio as well. The hug he had to offer was firm and comforting, but there was a need there, a desperation to make sure she knew what she meant to him.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Hi, mama,"
     </em>
     he murmured at her, tightening the embrace the most minute amount, but still enough for her to feel it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Hi sweet boy,"
     </em>
     she crooned back softly, her cheek pressed to his chest.
     <em>
      "Did you find what you were looking for?"
     </em>
     One of her hands smoothed over his back for a few paces before she released her hold, looking up at him with bright eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I did. I um... I spent most of my time at the boat house. I thought about texting to ask if that was okay but I didn't think you'd mind..."
     </em>
     he informed her lowly. When he glanced over his shoulder to see that Agatha had ventured forth to mingle with the girls in the living room, any tension he might have been holding onto seemed to melt away.
     <em>
      "It felt like a good place to... just... be."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Every muscle in Rio's face softened in one fell swoop and she raised a hand to gingerly brush at his cheek with her knuckles.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's good for that, isn't it?" she posed sweetly, her lips lifting at the corners in a knowing smile.
    </p>
<p>
     "I watched a couple of your documentaries. The one about the glass frogs was my favorite." His statement was so genuine, so real, and somehow, Rio felt it even deeper because of the context in which that particular instance had come to be. He had been looking for ways to deal with impossibly large feelings about incredibly difficult things and his solution had been to find ways to be closer to
     <em>
      Rio.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could not have known or understood, but Nicky saw the way she loved his mother and by tapping into those deeper parts of her while in his own isolation, he had found a little more of the patience and understanding Rio always seemed to be so capable of. He had sought her guidance in ways he knew he could not derive from her personally due to her relationship with his mother, and he had found it in the nights he fell asleep to the sounds of waves. He had found it in documentaries about glass frogs and if she had to guess, he had probably watched the one about the tasmanian devil and found it there, too.
    </p>
<p>
     "The glass frog one is a really good one. Next time, should you need a selection, the narwhal one is
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     interesting." Her hand dropped, but Nicky was already grinning by the time she finished speaking.
    </p>
<p>
     "I
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     picked that one, but went for the one about the tasmanian devil instead."
    </p>
<p>
     Aha! She'd known that! Somehow, she'd known that!
    </p>
<p>
     "Also a great watch," she affirmed with a curt nod, though her smile was still friendly. "I hope you found what you needed to in them."
    </p>
<p>
     He gave a tip of his head in response, a softening happening in his eyes as he regarded his mama. It caused a light pink and almost embarrassed blush to creep across Rio's cheeks, her smile turning a little more bashful.
    </p>
<p>
     "You just
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     have the answers, huh?" he decided to offer instead.
    </p>
<p>
     "Even when I'm not around, it seems." Her answer was wise, but it was also bound in an understanding of what she had become as one of two heads to their family. The other members found things in her and her presence, like perspective and reason.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky offered her one last smile bright with his appreciation before he turned toward the living room and they set about the rest of their evening. It had included the arroz con pollo Estee had made, the Spanish wine Nicky had dug out of the cellar, and a marathon of reality television that not a one of them actually paid attention to.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio folded herself into bed and against her wife's side later that night, Agatha's whispered musings tickled something deep in Rio's chest.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Alright, you can say it."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's silence was a blinding beacon of her confusion.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You can say you told me so."
     </em>
     There was the lightest teasing to Agatha's tone, but the lower registers she used told Rio that she might have actually
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     to hear it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I told you it was going to be okay,"
     </em>
     Rio obliged her, though her words melted into a hum at the way the points of Agatha's fingernails dug lightly at her scalp.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Your ability to be right is truly nauseating sometimes,"
     </em>
     Agatha informed her before succumbing to a long yawn, one needy in the way that it begged for respite after such a long day.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "And yet you still insist I'm wrong about brussel sprouts tasting the way feet smell. Of all the things I am most right about in the world, that's the one."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Go to sleep, my green goddess,"
     </em>
     Agatha teased, referencing a silly joke Rhys had made during their last round of photos.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You first, my wild witch."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     In a bout of sleepy giggles and soft kisses, Rio found more than enough comfort to achieve a blissful state of slumber.
    </p>
<p>
     Although Agatha had gone back to work the week prior, it was the week following the interview that things had really picked back up. She was in the beginning stages of a brand new project, having shelved the New Zealand one for the time being. Part of her logic there, as she had informed Rio, was that she could revisit at a time when they were ready to weave those temporary roots for a while in their second home.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, Rio often found Agatha awake at three in the morning scribbling in her notebook. She could see sometimes, in the middle of a television show or even a meal, that pinch of focus when Agatha would scoop up her phone and fervently punch in several sentences before locking it, stowing it, and acting as if it had never even happened.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had dropped back into her groove, one she had not embraced fully since before their paths had crossed. It was fascinating to watch from Rio's perspective and while she had never had a worry about what it might look like when Agatha's career was placed back above the flame, she felt justified in the realization that she would love Agatha's creative heart, no matter what hour of the morning it brought her to consciousness and pushed her to turn on her little bedside lamp.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had vision and it seemed she also had the ability to turn the flow of those ideations on and off with utter ease.
    </p>
<p>
     Thursday had rolled around and it was slated to be Agatha's busiest day that week. She had three meetings and a business lunch to tend to that day, so when she awoke to the sound of her alarm, she had immediately rolled to her wife. Rio stirred as well, whining softly as Agatha placed a few deliberate kisses to different points on her face, her beguiling soft and convincing.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Go back to sleep, baby. I'll see you when I get home."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio puckered her lips, eyes still closed in her wordless demand. A second later, she was met with the response in the form of a soft kiss that somehow tasted of the longing Agatha suddenly had toward the idea of just staying right there and tossing her day out the window.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Go on, my love. You've a full day ahead of you,"
     </em>
     Rio encouraged in a whisper. She brushed her lips just barely over Agatha's one more time before she sank back down into the pillow, bringing the duvet up to her chin.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she felt it, Rio knew that Agatha was going to kiss her cheek. She did not know that Agatha was going to kiss her temple, her eyebrow, her forehead.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you,"
     </em>
     Agatha whispered with one more impactful kiss to the direct center of Rio's forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's first response was a warm hum that sounded from between pressed lips, but in her grogginess, she had been delayed in following it up if only for a moment.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you too, Agatha. And I hope you have a good day."
     </em>
     There was only one more moment of hesitation on Agatha's end before she was removing herself from bed and setting about her routine.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could have fallen back asleep, but she fought not to. She wanted to make sure she was awake when Agatha would inevitably come to her side of the bed, lean over and kiss that little curve of her eyebrow and give the reminder one more time that Rio was loved before she went about her busy day.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she listened to the sounds of the shower. She listened to one of her favorite things in the midst of that shower: the tunes of Agatha humming. Rio could not place the melody, but it was still soothing in the best way. She listened as her wife shuffled around -- likely in a towel, but not once did Rio open her eyes to check -- and chose something to wear, did her makeup and her hair.
    </p>
<p>
     Once Agatha was suited in her armor for the day, she had done exactly as Rio had predicted she would and found herself bedside, leaning over Rio in her preparations to depart. Rio had known it before she was even close simply by the scent of her perfume.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mmm, Flowerbomb today? Smells like a pretty flower but bites like a Venus fly trap,"
     </em>
     Rio teased the moment Agatha was close enough for their lips to touch.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha kissed her, that last physical act of farewell, before she offered her retort.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You're supposed to be sleeping, not hassling me before I have to leave,"
     </em>
     Agatha teased.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Had to make sure you were properly razzed for when you walked out the door,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured, her lips curling into a coy smile.
    </p>
<p>
     With a soft growl, Agatha placed one last kiss to Rio's temple before she stood. Her fingertips traced along the backs of Rio's fingers where her hand laid flat on the pillow in front of her face. "I would rather be other things properly, but duty calls. I love you. Now go back to sleep."
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Yes ma'am,"
     </em>
     Rio agreed, only able to stifle her consequent yawn for a moment longer. Agatha had almost made it to the door by the time Rio recovered enough to call after her.
     <em>
      "I love you, Agatha."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     That strong chin cocked over Agatha's shoulder, her hair falling enough to reveal the bright smile the sentiment seemed to bring her more often than not.  Rio listened to the sound of her heels on the hardwood, down the stairs and eventually, there was the quietest 'thud' of the front door that signified Agatha had departed for the day.
    </p>
<p>
     There was still the smallest curl on Rio's lips as she rolled over to face Agatha's side of the bed, pulling one of her pillows to her chest for that touch of extra comfort that allowed her to slip right back into sleep for a little while longer.
    </p>
<p>
     Hours later, Rio had woken up, showered and thrown on a simple tank top and pai of shorts so that she could move comfortably about the house. For her, things were slow for the time being. The following month she had several meetings lined up in regards to the acquisition of the pollinating drones and there were still things that needed to be handled, like considering the idea of council for contract negotiations.
    </p>
<p>
     That could be a problem for another day.
    </p>
<p>
     On the day before her, all Rio wanted to do were simple household chores like laundry and making lunch for the girls before they departed to meet with Cole for the afternoon.
    </p>
<p>
     There were things that had been said by Estee and Tay since the honeymoon that were slowly leading Rio toward the understanding that they were looking to sink their roots a little deeper into LA soil. This meeting with Cole, while Estee did not go into detail, was the second one that week. Perhaps Rio was reaching, but... Cole was an established psychologist in the area and Estee was looking to become one. The partnership there didn't seem so unlikely, should it come to fruition.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had already been gone when she'd come downstairs and Estee had informed her it was something related to a new project he was working on and that he was driving down to San Diego. That meant he likely wouldn't be back until at least late afternoon.
    </p>
<p>
     A strange feeling washed over Rio at around two pm that day as she realized she was the only one in the house.
    </p>
<p>
     It was... peace.
    </p>
<p>
     It was knowing that while her own life was in neutral in regards to her career, the lives of those around her were finding the right pace on each of their tracks. Her wife was ascending back to her rightful place on her throne at the head of the industry, her daughters were looking at viable career options in a new home to them. Her son was wild and following his gut when it came to business ventures.
    </p>
<p>
     Each and every one of her loves, bathing in the successes of their lives, thriving in their growth.
    </p>
<p>
     Meanwhile, she was idling in her complacency and comfort of an accomplished life in the forms of a basket full of folded laundry by the closet door and freshly vacuumed carpet beneath her toes.
    </p>
<p>
     While she did not have an intention to nap, Rio couldn't keep herself from climbing into their big bed, letting herself relax into the plush mattress for a few moments of respite. Surely there were other things she could tend to around the house, but for the time being, it was nice to just take a breather and exist in the silence.
    </p>
<p>
     Just as Rio's eyes started to grow heavy, her phone vibrated on the nightstand beside her, calling for her attention. She pulled it over to see a text from Estee that Nicky was heading back their way, but that he was going to meet up with the four of them and they were going to do a bit of shopping before making it home for the 7pm family dinner that had been planned. Rio had shot a quick response that consisted of a reminder to pick up the meal from Toro on time and a short list of 'be careful, have fun, call if you need anything, te amo' before she dropped her phone back onto the nightstand.
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio withdrew from her place propped on her elbow to lay back onto the bed, she opened the drawer first and removed her iPad. After flipping open the cover and positioning it so that it would be propped up, she laid down and set it on her stomach, taking no time to open up the tumblr app. With just a few taps, she found herself in her most recent happy place.
    </p>
<p>
     head4harkness.tumblr.com
    </p>
<p>
     Her personal heaven.
    </p>
<p>
     At first, it wasn't even inherently sexual. It was truly a treat to scroll through pages and pages of photos of her wife, to see her evolution through the years and how she had grown into the woman Rio loved with every inch of her being. What was even more of a delight was that there were no traces of paparazzi photos, ones that were splattered across gossip rags that wanted to dig deeper into her personal life. The ones showcased were professional, they were appropriate.
    </p>
<p>
     So Rio scrolled.
    </p>
<p>
     She would occasionally tap the little heart, not having enough sense to understand that the username she had chosen for herself -- rioharkness-vidal.tumblr.com -- would be a lot more conspicuous the following week when their interview was published. For the time being, she was just enjoying one of her little trips through Agatha's life in images.
    </p>
<p>
     There were ones of her at events, gifs of her with the slow-mo cameras, a few released on-set photos from various projects. It was so fascinating to just get lost in those pictures, to appreciate everything that Agatha was and ever had been.
    </p>
<p>
     The lower Rio scrolled, the more photos she found that she had not seen before. When a set rolled up the screen, Rio felt her breath catch somewhere deep in her lungs.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was
     <em>
      young.
     </em>
     If Rio had to guess, early thirties and not too long after Nicky had been born. Her skin looked flawless, so smooth and glowing. Her eyes were so impossibly bright with a still-youthful innocence that was only speckled by the anguish of her secrets. That smile she wore on those muted pink lips was swoon worthy and there was a vibrance in her expression and Rio still caught glimpses of sometimes.
    </p>
<p>
     She was wearing a stunning black dress, one with a bow tied at the top of the chest portion. The strapless design left everything above it completely bare and free. Agatha was not donning any jewelry, just that pink dusted chest and smooth skin that hugged every divot caused by muscle in her neck or collarbones.
    </p>
<p>
     One photo was from a more forward angle, the other from the side with her head turned looking toward the camera. In the second, that bare patch of skin behind Agatha's ear drew her attention. She knew what it looked like now. She knew it was her favorite spot, and now, it bore her little boat.
    </p>
<p>
     Something about that photo, the longer she looked at it, caused a flame to roll in her lower belly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew Agatha was beautiful. That was literally fact and nothing would ever change it.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing Agatha like that was a new kind of beauty, a kind that tugged at something primal and raw in the stem of Rio's brain. With the iPad still propped on her stomach, Rio shifted slightly, her thighs rubbing togther as she tried to dismiss the idea. This was just harmless scrolling. She was just enjoying the collection of her wife throughout the years.
    </p>
<p>
     So, she kept scrolling.
    </p>
<p>
     That lasted all of twenty seconds before she was swiping her way back up the page to that set, the one that hadn't left her mind even as she had tried to navigate away. Subconsciously, teeth dug a bit roughly at the inside of her bottom lip and she found herself squirming again.
    </p>
<p>
     She was home alone. No one would know. Agatha wouldn't have to know, even if it was probable that Rio would end up telling her anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     Ah, what the hell.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lifted the iPad off of her stomach and set it on the bed, using pinched fingers to zoom in on the second photo, a full display of nothing but neck, collarbones and chest from a side profile.
    </p>
<p>
     So many things raced through Rio's mind, from the noise Agatha made when she kissed that spot behind her ear to the way her chest could look like when Rio had her fun and left it speckled with small hickeys and bite marks. She thought about the sigh Agatha released almost every single time Rio dipped her tongue into that little well between her collarbones at the base of her throat. Rio imagined tucking a finger into the top of that dress and giving the smallest tug and how it would reveal those perfect breasts that she could shower in attention for days on end.
    </p>
<p>
     Somewhere in the middle of those thoughts, her hand had started to wander, traversing over the ripples of fabric in the form of the tanktop on her torso. Fingertips were deliberate as they pressed to smooth skin, tucking beneath the cinched waist of the shorts that hung on her hips and the cotton panties beneath them.
    </p>
<p>
     Senselessly, the right side of Rio's bottom lip tucked between her teeth as her fingertips wove through the course hair that surprisingly grew substantially more wet the lower she ventured. Okay, so she'd consciously been hung up on those photos, but her body had been too, apparently.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a darkness that had filled Rio's hungry gaze as she consumed the image before her, using it to assist her in the ability to paint others in her mind, ones where her lips consumed those empty spaces, kissing and sucking to her hearts content. Then there were ones of the intimacy of helping her out of such a dress, of the sheer beauty of appreciating her for what she had been in a way no one else had at the time.
    </p>
<p>
     Oh, the things she would have done for that Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     The ways Rio would have touched her, kissed her, loved her the way she deserved to be loved.
    </p>
<p>
     This thoughts were inundating her mind as her fingers skated through her own hot arousal, down and then up, down and then back up. She felt consumed by a deep ache to simply reach in and promise that Agatha the world, show her everything she deserved to see,
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     everything she deserved to feel.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's mind was running so far away with her that by the time her fingertips made contact with her clit, her legs twitched involuntarily and a weak moan escaped her lips into the silent stillness of the house. The pace of her breathing had quickened and the pace she had started quickly seemed to hasten, hips shifting in a rhythm against her own touch.
    </p>
<p>
     Although she never took her focus from the screen, her head tipped back and another moan -- this one considerably stronger -- poured from her, a cry of need and desperation. Her hips shifted again, having decided that what she was doing was not getting her where she needed to go. The pressure on her clit lifted and dropped, a lone finger pressing to her entrance for a moment before sliding inside.
    </p>
<p>
     That time, the sensation was enough to force her eyes shut as her head dropped all the way into the pillow and a deep, rich moan rumbled out of her. After regaining a bit more sense, those green eyes opened again, falling back to the iPad as her mind took off at a sprint again. By the time she had pressed a second digit into herself, Rio's whimpers were consistent with each thrust.
    </p>
<p>
     She had been so completely fixated on what she was doing that it had apparently given her tunnel vision, enough that she did not have any inkling as Agatha appeared in the doorway, marveled for a long moment, paced inside, shut the door and walked over to the vanity. Rio was
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     zeroed in on her own pleasure that when she heard the leg of the chair at the vanity catch on the inside corner of the vanity itself, she was so scared that her soul nearly ejected straight out of her body.
    </p>
<p>
     Out of nothing but put instinct, her head snapped to the side and her arm ripped back, hand free from the constraints of Rio's shorts in an instant.  Her eyes were wide and filled with fear, as though she had been doing something wrong. She knew she wasn't, but she also had not been expecting Agatha home for another few hours.
    </p>
<p>
     In the middle of kicking her shoes off and concurrently unfastening her trousers, Agatha glanced up to see that Rio had completely stopped what she was doing. Her lips turned down and brow pinched in her disappointment.
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't stop on my behalf," Agatha informed her, and while the offer was sweet, her tone was sultry and deep. Agatha sounded hungry.
    </p>
<p>
     "But... I --" Rio stammered, clearly flustered from being so close to the brink of an orgasm and also being so surprised. Her skin was crimson nearly from head to toe.
    </p>
<p>
     "You should take the shorts off, though," Agatha commented, her hands sliding over her hips to push down both her panties and trousers so that they pooled around her ankles just before she stepped out of them and kicked them to the side.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was stuck, stalled somewhere with a spinning rainbow wheel of death cycling in her head over and over again. What was happening? She had gotten a little carried away browsing head4harkness, Agatha had come home early, and now she was... stripping down and placing herself half naked in the vanity chair that she had turned to face the bed?
    </p>
<p>
     It was when Agatha leaned forward in the chair and peeled her blouse over her head that Rio realized what was happening.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was making a choice. A very big choice. She was placing herself into a situation that could have had a negative mental connotation. She was sitting to the side to witness a sexual act that mass produced lustful chemicals in her brain. This time, Agatha was making that choice because she had come home to her wife fucking herself to... A photo of her from twenty years prior? It wasn't the time to question
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     choice, surely. Instead, it was a bold statement that not only was she overcoming her own past, but that she was embracing a new future where she found arousal in her wife's self-stimulation, enough to make it known.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio complied with Agatha's suggestion and shucked the shorts on her lower half, kicking them to the middle of the bed along with her underwear. On second thought, she sat up and stripped herself free from the tank top, too, before she settled back on the bed. This time, though, she didn't need the image on the screen of the iPad.
    </p>
<p>
     No, Rio had the real thing, all the inches of bare skin she loved to taste and mark and reveal in. She had those pebbled and pink nipples she loved to run her tongue over. She had that valley down the middle of Agatha's abdomen and the dark hair at the peak between her thighs. She had those thighs, so delectable and muscular in a way that Rio loved having around her head.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Agatha's bra dropped to the ground and she shifted, leaning back in the chair so that she could comfortably spread her legs, Rio's hand had jumped right back into its station, digits sinking inside of her at the sight of Agatha's open and bared cunt, hairs soaked with the proof of what seeing Rio on the bed like that had done to her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Fuck, Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio whimpered, hardly able to keep her eyes open to behold the true beauty of Agatha as her hand wound down her body, stopping to pinch and toy with her left nipple for just a moment. Her eyes were cemented to Rio's form, absolutely devouring the side profile of her shifting and writing body as she began to reinstate the rhythmic fucking she'd been in the throes of when Agatha had shown up.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Coming home to you getting off to thirty-year-old me was not on the bingo card,"
     </em>
     Agatha rasped informatively, as if Rio would actually be able to retain being told such a thing with the state she was in.
     <em>
      "But fucking Christ."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Even though Agatha was touching
     <em>
      herself
     </em>
     , Rio could almost feel it in her own body as she watched Agatha sink her two middle fingers into her own wet sex, the sound indicating just how turned on she actually was. The visuals, the sound, the way Agatha's head tipped back and a low rattling echoed from her throat hit every single button in Rio's brain at one time. Her own fingers curled up as she felt her nerves light up and her walls clenched around the digits inside them.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oh my godddd!"
     </em>
     Rio wailed, hips locking as they shifted down and her orgasm nearly stole the breath out of her lungs.
    </p>
<p>
     Her legs and arms trembled in her pleasure, the softest whines befalling her as she rode out the rest of her orgasm. As her eyes reopened, they took in the sight of the ceiling for a few seconds, but something pulled at her attention. It was the soft sounds of Agatha as she cycled between whines and pants.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head lulled to the side, electric emerald gaze falling on her wife who was watching her like an absolute predator, fingers slowly working in and out of her own body. It was clear that where Rio had been in her chase had been too far along for Agatha to catch up. Now, she was all but eye-fucking Rio as she laid there in that big bed, chest heaving from her effort.
    </p>
<p>
     She sucked on her lower lip for just a moment as she mapped out a plan and set forth. She first removed her fingers, sliding them back up as she grazed her clit, causing her legs to twitch. Once past that, those wet fingers skated a path up her stomach, diverting to her right breast as she pinched and pulled at her nipple, soft sighs escaping her at the stimulation the act offered. It reinstated that throbbing between her legs, her breath catching as she watch Agatha increase her pace.
    </p>
<p>
     Consideration came and went. Rio had briefly entertained the idea of giving Agatha the show of a lifetime, but she had something better in mind. Something
     <em>
      way
     </em>
     better.
    </p>
<p>
     In fact, when she sat up and Agatha whined in protest, she knew that if Agatha could give her just a couple of moments of patience, she could make it worth it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Can't you go again?"
     </em>
     Agatha nearly begged, hips shifting into her own touch as she worked her body over.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I could,"
     </em>
     Rio mused as she slid to her feet and stood, her entire nude body on display for her wife's parched gaze to drink in. Her footsteps were slow, measured and deliberate as she stalked forward. Her gaze dropped to one of Agatha's knees and traced inward to that dutiful hand as she fucked herself, all the way to the other.
     <em>
      "But I don't want to."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio could see almost every place in Agatha's body where her muscles were tensing with the way her body was working against her touch, against that stimultion she was seeking to bring her a pleasure she was so starved for.
     <em>
      "Th-then... What... What
      <b>
       do
      </b>
      you want??"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Close enough to stand between Agatha's knees, Rio dropped to her own. Her head ducked down and soft lips met the skin of Agatha's inner left thigh, kissing first then parting to suck hungrily before she whispered her reply.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I just want to help."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Still on her knees, Rio rose up a bit, dropping her hand to rest on the top of Agatha's thigh, at first. She gave a light squeeze and leaned toward the other to drag her teeth along it. As she began to kiss and lick and suck, she was still very aware that Agatha's pace in and out of her own body had never desisted, and that was exactly what she wanted. Rio's hand inched inward and turned, landing so that her palm pressed to the top of Agatha's wrist, and then the back of her hand.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Help me, baby,"
     </em>
     Agatha pleaded, her motions picking up speed within Rio's light hold.
    </p>
<p>
     So, Rio decided to help.
    </p>
<p>
     At the very moment she sank her teeth roughly into Agatha's thigh, her hand slid down and a lone middle finger settled into the groove between Agatha's middle two knuckles. Her deviously feral gaze lifted to see Agatha's head tipped back, lips parted at the bliss she was already feeling. Rio did not even think that Agatha was aware enough to sense what was about to happen.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't hesitate. As Agatha eased her own fingers back, Rio detected the rhythm and matched it the moment Agatha pressed back into herself, sliding her own finger in as a third to the two Agatha had already been using to fill herself.
    </p>
<p>
     The very moment it happened, Agatha's body reacted without restraint. Her knees tried to close even slightly, but Rio's presence kept that from happening. Her head dropped back even further and the loudest, wildest cry of a moan echoed throughout the entire house.  It was almost too frantic to be a moan, something that edged closer toward a yowl, a desperate vibration of nothing but unfiltered pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "How's that feel, my love?"
     </em>
     Rio murmured against Agatha's thigh, kissing little trails up to her hip and back down again as the two of them established a steady pace in and out of her tight and dripping pussy.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "S-So... So good. So full,"
     </em>
     she whimpered in response, her hips shifting as if to declare she wanted more, needed it even.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Too full?"
     </em>
     Rio probed, nipping at the skin before her in a way that drew a high pitched whine straight from Agatha's throat.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "N-No,"
     </em>
     Agaha stammered back through her ragged breaths,
     <em>
      "not f-full enough."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Oh. Was that a
     <em>
      challenge
     </em>
     Rio was suddenly hearing? Her gaze began to move from the ocean of thigh before her, winding up over bare hip to toned stomach. It hesitated on those voluptuous breasts as they bounced with the way Agatha was riding their fingers in that chair. When they raised even further, Agatha dropped her chin and blue eyes flew open to lock into green ones.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You want more?"
     </em>
     Rio asked, trying to navigate away from the near seizure that was happening between her legs and how she was certain her own arousal was only seconds from seeping down her legs.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "More,"
     </em>
     Agatha gasped with a weak nod, tongue poking out to swipe any moisture she could manage across her dry lips.
     <em>
      "Please, baby. Please, more."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha was a powerful woman, that was something almost everyone in the world knew.
    </p>
<p>
     Right then, begging her wife to be thoroughly fucked with a combined four of their fingers, Agatha was nothing more than pure putty in Rio's hands. She would have begged, groveled, pleaded if it meant she got more of Rio and more of the pleasure that came from her calculated and driven actions.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, as they drew back, Rio dropped her the other middle finger, settling it in the next rut between Agatha's own fingers before gently guiding their hands forward. The moment all four fingers slid inside of Agatha's body, she came instantly and Rio could feel it. She was pulsing and squeezing around them, her cries an obvious indicator of how it was affecting her. Her body was shaking in that familiar way only to Rio, but as she started to move, to offer relief, Agatha's other hand practically flew forward and held her in place.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Don't stop. Not yet,"
     </em>
     Agatha somehow managed despite the fact that she sounded like she'd been running miles a day for days on end.
    </p>
<p>
     This time, Rio could actually
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     as her own wetness dribbled down the inside of her thigh as she remained poised in front of her wife, on her knees, with their hands still sunk deep inside Agatha's tight core, the walls of which were still fluttering in pleasure around them.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You want me to keep going?"
     </em>
     Rio questioned lowly, shifting enough that she could drop her head to kiss Agatha's hip.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I want to feel that again,"
     </em>
     Agatha agreed in a desperate rasp. Her hips shifted again, lifting in encouragement.
    </p>
<p>
     Slowly and carefully, Rio used her light hold on Agatha's hand to resume their motions again, though doing so instantly caused Agatha to moan loudly, head dropping back once more at the utter fullness she felt between her legs.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You are so fucking hot, Agatha,"
     </em>
     Rio groaned as they established a new rhythm, one that left Agatha writhing in that chair and Rio simply watching her in the horniest sense of wonder she had ever felt herself capable of in her entire life.
     <em>
      "So wet for me that you can take so much of us."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The groan that vibrated out of Agatha was guttural and low, so deep that it had to have formed somewhere near the spot Rio was trying to compel them to reach inside of her. They were working, back and forth at a steady pace but Rio had an idea. A deliciously devious idea.
    </p>
<p>
     After a couple more strokes, Rio put her idea into action.
    </p>
<p>
     She applied a gentle pressure on the back of Agatha's fingers, forcing them to curl upward against her walls. Rio could not feel what she was searching for with the way they were positioned, so she used Agatha's reactions to gauge if her own fingers were landing in the right spot.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha's breath hitched and her hips bucked up, a long and drawn out moan sounding from her, Rio knew they'd found it. With more force this time, she pressed the backs of Agatha's fingers again, giving them no option but to hook inward. The moment she did this, the panicked and frantic yelps began as they tumbled again and again from Agatha's lips.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Rio! Rio, no! No nonononono!"
     </em>
     she tried to warn, but Rio didn't care. She had a pretty good feeling she knew what was going to happen and she wanted to revel in every last minute of it.
    </p>
<p>
     A little more pressure came from her grip and even though Agatha was still whining the word 'no' over and over again, Rio knew she didn't want her to stop.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I... Rio, I'm -- oh! FUCK!"
     </em>
     she attempted, but before Agatha could force the words out, her body spoke for her.
    </p>
<p>
     That beautiful, full, delectable body Rio loved so much shouted its pleasure by way of the sheer force of Agatha's cunt clenching so tight, shoving their fingers out. Agatha's hand jerked back to grip at the arm of the chair and Rio's dropped to land on the top of her own thigh, her brain too stunned to place it anywhere else as the forceful gush of Agatha's orgasm splashed out, coating Rio's chest, breasts and abdomen in wet pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was simply stunned. She knew what Agatha's body was capable of, as they had found out the time she had come home from America in the back of Tay's car, but this?
    </p>
<p>
     This was moving art if Rio had ever seen it.
    </p>
<p>
     The noises Agatha was making were desperate and nearly insane, yowls and howls like she were nothing more than a trapped animal writhing around in the most intense amount of pleasure that could have seemed as though it were close to bordering on painful. Despite those sounds and the way her body was doing little more than convulsing, Rio could tell by the bliss on Agatha's face that she was loving every single wet, loud, violently wild moment of it.
    </p>
<p>
     After a few more splashes of the liquid dropped from her body at the pulsing of her worked-over cunt, Agatha went completely limp in the chair. Her chest heaved and her breaths were deep and jagged as she tried to swim through the fuzziness of the pleasure that had completely pulled her under.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oh. My. God."
     </em>
     Rio breathed, her eyes and mystified as she watched the heap that was her wife as she tried to remember what it was to be a human being after being fucked into outer space in such a way.
     <em>
      "That was... Holy fuck, Agatha, that was
      <b>
       so fucking hot.
      </b>
      "
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The hand of Agatha's that had somehow landed on her stomach lifted just enough for her to wave two fingers loosely around in the air, a silent acknowledgement that said she literally was unable to use her words.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hands found homes on either one of Agatha's hips as she scooted forward and dipped her head, placing kisses to Agatha's sternum, letting them pepper down her middle and back up again.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I wanna do that again,"
     </em>
     she whispered over a stiff nipple before she snagged it between her teeth and gave it a soft tug. Agatha's body twitched everywhere and another low moan rumbled out of her.
     <em>
      "I want you to soak me over and over again like that. Fucking hell."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     This time, the noise Agatha found herself capable of was a pathetic but somehow still needy mewling that nearly slammed Rio right between the legs. It sounded so desperate, like she wanted it too, but could not muster any form of a verbal agreement. Rio's lips were moving again, surfing over waves of skin until they reached Agatha's hand, this time not skipping over it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips graced Agatha's knuckles, but then they parted to allow her tongue to present itself as it ran along the length of Agatha's two centered fingers. Beneath that idle palm, Agatha squirmed unwittingly, a natural reaction to what she perceived was happening.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Rio, fuck,"
     </em>
     she finally managed to say, but it was so quiet and sharp that Rio almost missed it.
    </p>
<p>
     The pace with which Agatha's chest had been heaving had finally slowed, a sign that she had managed to catch the breath Rio had maniacally pried from her lungs. Innocently, Rio's gaze lifted and her tongue retracted into her mouth, a proud grin sliding easily onto her lips as she eased back to sit on her heels.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Y'alright then, my love?"
     </em>
     Rio whispered to her, hands sliding down to the tops of Agatha's thighs, still spread wide with her between them and salivating at the mere idea of diving right in. Something in her told her that a relocation would be optimal in regards to Agatha's comfort.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "What... What the actual fuck?"
     </em>
     came Agatha's soft wheezing, still seemingly a bit detached from reality. She was just floating, hovering in the post-orgasmic bliss that had nearly swallowed her whole.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio giggled softly, a palm landing directly between Agatha's breasts, gliding up her sternum toward her neck. While it cupped her throat for just a moment, Rio's fingers slid around to thread through the hair at the nape of Agatha's neck, gently easing her forward.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Can you make it to the bed?"
     </em>
     she questioned, extending upward enough so that she could press their lips together in a soft but impressed exchange.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Yeah... Yeah, I think so,"
     </em>
     Agatha answered, but she didn't sound entirely sold.
    </p>
<p>
     No matter. Rio would get her there regardless.
    </p>
<p>
     Using Agatha's thighs for leverage, Rio pushed herself to her feet and held her hands out, palms up, to request they be met with Agatha's. Once she had a firm grip, she helped hoist Agatha up, guiding her over to the bed on wobbly knees, something that caused the lightest and most tickled giggle to bubble from Rio's throat.
    </p>
<p>
     Skin still wet with undeniable proof of Agatha's last orgasm, Rio watched as Agatha slid onto the bed and landed on her back, head propped up on the pillows. She glanced to the side and swiped up the bottle of water she saw sitting on her nightstand, holding it out to her wife before she chose to climb in bed with her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Drink first, my love,"
     </em>
     Rio gently urged. She knew what she was after and she knew what that might do to Agatha's body in the process, so it was better to take the precautions while she was still of sane enough mind to consider them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha obediently took the bottle from her and downed several gulps of it, only sitting up just enough as to not choke. Once she was finished, she dropped herself back to the bed and capped the bottle, forking it back over to Rio who placed it once more on the nightstand and climbed onto the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     She had made her intentions known, yes, but there was more to it than that. This wasn't just about the insatiable lust that had seemingly filled her at the idea of Agatha loving her and trusting her so fucking much that she felt comfortable enough to put herself in that chair and enjoy the show. No, it was about knowing that they were so in tune that this could be as intimate as it was proving to be, too.
    </p>
<p>
     They seemed to stumble headlong into these new and exciting facets of their relationship and right then, they could have plummeted in that bliss for eternity, never once touching the ground. Suspension in a state like that? It could have been an endless dream, one Rio would have happily lived in forever.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead of placing herself between Agatha's legs immediately, Rio instead placed Agatha between her own, crawling to straddle her hips. She settled, her core settling just above Agatha's pubic bone. It allowed her to lean forward, hair spiling over her shoulder as her face hovered inches above Agatha's, mirrored and hungry smiles curling both pairs of lips.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "M'glad you got to come home early,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured at her. Tauntingly, her tongue poked out as her head ducked and ran just barely along the underside of Agatha's upper lip, causing her to release a sigh that evolved mid-way into a whine.
     <em>
      "But you could have warned me."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     A soft huff of a chuckle expelled from Agatha's lips.
     <em>
      "And risk missing out on this? No fucking way."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It was the most coherent string of words she had managed since she'd sat down in that chair. That was something that needed remedied, and quickly.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Good. 'Cause we're nowhere near done. I've got..."
     </em>
     Rio lifted herself up and reached over, giving two taps to her phone screen to check the time. She resumed her position folded over Agatha, a vicious smirk twisting its way up her lips.
     <em>
      "At least the next two and a half hours to have my fun."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oh my fucking godddddd."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It could have been a groan, but it was nowhere near a protest as it had careened out of Agatha's mouth. In fact, it was all the permission Rio had needed to dive right back in.
    </p>
<p>
     Over those two hours, with considerable pee breaks and time to chug water, Rio had managed to exact a total of four more orgasms from Agatha's writhing form, but only two of them had yielded the soaking proof Rio had been seeking. Having achieved a fifty percent success rate, Rio had found herself quite proud of her own effort and even more proud of the results.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha had crumpled to the utterly destroyed sheets beneath her and dozed off, Rio let her sleep the remainder of the time until they needed to get into the shower to clean up for dinner. In that time, she'd done what she could in regards to the carpet by the vanity and the fabric on the chair with the cleaner in the bathroom, but anything in regards to the bed would simply have to wait until after dinner.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon Agatha's rousing, they had agreed on a shower, but Agatha still seemed the slightest bit unsteady, enough that Rio decided to instead run them a bath.
    </p>
<p>
     Somehow, that had devolved into her procuring one last orgasm as she'd clung of Agatha from behind, her legs hooked over Agatha's in that big bathtub to keep her wide open as she convulsed through her orgasm, trying so desperately to close them. Without that ability, the way her body shook in Rio's hold had been stimulating in its own right, causing Rio to spontaneously orgasm on her own. The trembles in her own form were nowhere near as violent as Agatha's, but that pleasure still rippled through her, wave after wave.
    </p>
<p>
     Once clean, they had dressed themselves in comfortable clothing, but were still appropriate for a meal with their children. Agatha had pulled on a pair of tight jean shorts with a little help from Rio, mostly just to keep her steady. On her torso was a loose lilac t-shirt with a faded black violet inked on it by design.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio, herself, was in a pair of bike shorts and a form-fitting black tank top, her hair in a braid that hung over her shoulder. Even though they looked presentable, Rio could tell that Agatha was feeling quite similar to a live wire that had been ripped from its outlet. She
     <em>
      seemed
     </em>
     calm, but when Rio would accidently brush her skin, sparks would shoot across her eyes and her breath would catch for the briefest moment.
    </p>
<p>
     When the sound of the front door slamming shut hit their ears, and then was followed by the idle chatter of their children who had arrived with dinner, the look in Agatha's eyes was almost panicked as they swept over to land on Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know that I love you," she began, her voice the slightest bit choked. It was as if she knew that what she was about to say was going to sound as insane out loud as it did in her head. "And you know I would
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     make this request if I did not mean it... But I need you to not fucking
     <em>
      touch
     </em>
     me for the next hour at least."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been locked onto her, ready to meet any request she made, but that one? Rio was grinning like a devious little idiot in an instant.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio Daniela, I fucking mean it. If we are in front of our children, I may completely lose my mind and that would be a poor showing for everyone involved."
    </p>
<p>
     Still grinning, Rio held her hands up with her palms out in a sign of surrender.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright, you have my word. Can I kiss you before we go down?" she returned in what she thought to be a fair trade.
    </p>
<p>
     "A peck, that's all," Agatha warned just before she puckered her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took her kiss, took Agatha's hand innocently, and they set off about the rest of their night.
    </p>
<p>
     They were in the middle of their meal, about half a glass of wine deep, when Rio's mind slipped the tiniest bit and her hand raised beneath the table to land on Agatha's knee. Instantly, mid-sip of her wine, Agatha's shocked gaze dropped to Rio in silent warning, pupils nearly blowing like a shark smelling blood in the water as she tried to not choke on the alcohol. The conversation they'd been having about the premiere for Jack's movie they would be attending in two weeks was suddenly over.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom?" Nicky questioned, leaning forward to look over at her better in his concern. "You alright?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha pulled the glass away from her lips at the same time Rio realized it was her hand that had spurred on the reaction and removed it, too.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm fine," Agatha snapped back, taking only the time to speak until she was downing the rest of her wine.
    </p>
<p>
     "Are you --" Nicky started to ask, but a sharp kick to his shin from his sister, sitting across from him, stopped the question before it made it all the way out. His gaze cut to her in sharp interrogation, but the look on her face seemed to be enough of an answer. In turn, he slouched in his seat, grumbling his disapproval.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was watching him, amused and waiting to see what, exactly he might have to say.
    </p>
<p>
     She didn't have to wait for long.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mom, mama... I love you both. But, respectfully, you're freaks."
    </p>

<em>
      This, this music makes me cry
     </em>
<br/>
<em>
      It sounds just like my soul
     </em>
<br/>
<em>
      Oh, but I'm not ready to win
     </em>
<br/>
<em>
      Oh Lord, cause I don't wanna know what they say
     </em>
<br/>

      *****
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The very second Rio received a text from her wife on a Friday morning about ten minutes after she'd left for work, she wanted to do exactly the opposite of the instruction in Agatha's message.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      DO NOT GO ONLINE. NOT YET. GIO IS TURNING AROUND RN. ILL BE RIGHT THERE.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Instead, Rio pressed her lips together and took a measured sip of her coffee, debating her next move. She had free will, she could do what she pleased, but she had a feeling that if Agatha was sending her a text in all capital letters with a demand, it would likely be a good idea to listen. Still, she was curious.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      And why, my love, should I not go online? Am I about to have my feelings hurt?
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Even though she should have been nervous, Rio couldn't find it in her quite yet. There was something about the noticeable lack of swear words in Agatha's message that was keeping Rio pacified. It could have been the silliest thing, but if somehow things in their world had gone completely sideway, something in Rio felt like she would have
     <em>
      known.
     </em>
     More than that, she likely would have gotten a message from Estee and/or Tay to indicate that they had caught something insane online.
    </p>
<p>
     Well, if they were even awake yet.
    </p>
<p>
     A minute later, Rio's phone vibrated in her hand.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      No. I don't think so. I'm not sure 100000% because I haven't read it yet, but Vogue just published the interview.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's jaw dropped slightly, her lips parting as a result. They had said it would likely be closer to two weeks, not one. There could have been several reasons for this, but Rio had already figured that it was likely because of every bit of hubbub that had arisen since the leak of the wedding photos. There was more and more gossip being throw about by the world at large and Vogue was fully aware of the fact that they were the only ones in possession of the whole truth.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's jaw snapped shut again, her lips pressing firmly together as she stared down at her phone, reading Agatha's message over and over again.
    </p>
<p>
     Their interview was online for the whole world to see. It was filled with the pictures Rhys had taken, and probably a few of the ones they had decided to send over from the wedding. It was filled with their story and their love and it was just a few short taps away...
    </p>
<p>
     No.
    </p>
<p>
     She couldn't. Agatha would be
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     upset and this was something far too small to violate trust over.
    </p>
<p>
     It was something they deserved to do together.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Okay, okay. Hurry up!
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio sent it, a quiet giggle passing through her lips as Agatha's response appeared almost immediately.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Gio just turned in the drive. Be there in a min. Get the iPad out and clear your head4harkness history before I get there.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     At that, Rio laughed. It was a full and hearty sound that had no witness to attest to how much joy was crammed into the vibration. Alright, so maybe Agatha knew her too well. Or she'd become a little predictable. Either way, it amused her.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio obliged her wife's request, reaching over to retrieve the iPad. She set it to the main screen, just marveling at the wallpaper; it was a selfie of the two of them that Agatha had taken in Iceland. They were bundled in their coats and hats to ward off the cold, their cheeks pink but their smiles wide and bright.
    </p>
<p>
     As happened every so often, Rio was hit with this overwhelming knowledge that she had come to love someone in a way she had never once known herself capable of.
    </p>
<p>
     Not just someone.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     She loved Agatha
     <em>
      that much.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had shifted to sit up a little more, the sleep still clinging to her vision. She raised a hand to wipe it away and, at the same time, heard the front door fling open and slam shut. Agatha's heavy footfalls through the downstairs, up the stairs, and down the hall could be heard clearly, even before she appeared in the door, looking wild and frenzied.
    </p>
<p>
     Her electric blue gaze dropped to the iPad and then lifted to Rio in silent question.
    </p>
<p>
     "I behaved. I was just admiring the iPad wallpaper," she admitted truthfully, her lips hitching up at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
     On her way to the bed, Agatha shed her blazer for the time being and climbed atop the mattress to press herself directly next to Rio, causing her to move the iPad in doing so to ensure she had room.
    </p>
<p>
     Once the iPad was perched and propped on her lap, Rio turned her head to take in her wife. Those eyes were wearing something new; it was a look of uncertainty, maybe even nervousness.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey," Rio voiced softly, a need to draw Agatha's attention. When Agatha listened and turned to face her, Rio's lips curled up comfortingly before she spoke. "Kiss me first and it'll make whatever is inside of there quite alright."
    </p>
<p>
     The relief immediately washed into those beautiful blue irises and Agatha's posture melted a fraction of an inch, the tension ebbing out of her. Her lips lifted for the few seconds it took for her to seal the space between them with a soft locking of their lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright," she announced, turning her attention back to the screen. "Let's do this."
    </p>
<p>
     "Let's," Rio agreed.
    </p>
<p>
     She pulled up Agatha's email and clicked on the link Dave had sent her.
    </p>
<p>
     There, beneath the Vogue header was a wide shot of the two of them as they walked hand-in-hand back up the aisle after they had exchanged their vows. Their guests were on their feet in the throes of their grinning and clapping.
    </p>
<p>
     The looks on their faces were inexplicable in their sheer joy and bliss. It was clear that they were in love, and it was even more clear just how loud that love was, even before a word had been written.
    </p>
<p>
     Below it, there was a large headline followed by a smaller by-line.
    </p>
<p>

    </p>
<p>
     Rio was grinning immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, she's
     <em>
      good,
     </em>
     " Agatha murmured, a smile playing up her own lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you want me to read it?" Rio as her, glancing in her direction for just a moment before looking back down at the iPad before them.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think I would like that," Agatha agreed smoothly, leaning over to kiss Rio's cheek.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay," she began, taking a deep breath.
    </p>
<p>
     "'Despite the chaos of a Friday morning in LA, as Director and Executive Producer Agatha Harkness walks into our studios hand-in-hand with her very new wife, Rio, it appears as though not a lick of the insanity of mid-morning traffic or long coffee lines has graced them.
    </p>
<p>
     They are well aware of all the buzz that has been happening over the leaked photos of their exclusive and very private wedding and while surprised, they both admit to simply taking it a day at a time.
    </p>
<p>
     When on a trip to prepare for her latest film, the two met in Auckland, New Zealand, where Rio was living at the time. When I ask them both to tell me about how they met, they turn to each other and grin, but Agatha is quick to take the lead.
    </p>
<p>
     "
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     personally was not having the best day. A boardroom meeting had me a little out of sorts when I was on a trip for a new project. It left me wandering around Auckland, New Zealand in the middle of the day mad as hell," she tells me, which sounds on-brand for her typical iron-fist style of organizing her projects.'"
    </p>
<p>
     At that, Rio had not been able to suppress a giggle, though Agatha immediately prodded her in the side.
    </p>
<p>
     "What?!" Rio managed back, still laughing. "She's not wrong!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, yeah. Keep going," Agatha encouraged.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, okay fine," Rio agreed, locating where she had left off.
    </p>
<p>
     "'As they sit with their hands locked between them, occasionally offering one another gentle grips of encouragement, she continues on. "I was on the phone with a friend, griping about what I had been dealing with and had not been paying attention to where I was going. I apparently was not paying attention to the shouting happening around me, either."
    </p>
<p>
     The more Agatha recants, the more she glances over at her wife, a smile occurring each time. She's looking directly at her when she speaks again. "The only thing I heard clearly was a wolf whistle as I was crossing a bridge over the marina."
    </p>
<p>
     This time, when she ventures forth, she looks directly at me with a disposition that I am sure I am the first reporter to ever see. She looks tame, reverent. Agatha looks as though she's about to tell me how the universe came into existence.
    </p>
<p>
     "I looked up, and across the water, there were a couple of houseboats. On the deck of one, there was a woman who looked like she'd just been lounging waving me down. When I went to acknowledge her, someone on a bike hit me hard enough that I lost my balance and fell over the railing."
    </p>
<p>
     The moment she tells me this, Agatha is grinning again, unable to stop herself from glancing to the woman at her side. When I request clarification as to whether or not she had landed directly in the water, she confirms this with a curt nod, though there are jovial lights dancing in her vibrant blue eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "Right into it," she tells me firmly, though the slightly sheepish smile that finds her with another glance to her companion tells me there's still some residual embarrassment over the initial meeting. "Launched my phone, was drenched... I was... not happy, but I swam over to climb out. I let her pull me onto the deck of her houseboat, and then she politely informed me that I had been walking in the bike lane."
    </p>
<p>
     The general consensus is that it takes a lot to not laugh at such a wild story, but we all three manage to keep going, this time as Rio speaks.
    </p>
<p>
     "I had been reading on my deck that afternoon after an otherwise boring day when I heard shouting. It's not all that uncommon, as the bikers around the city are a lively bunch. But... when I looked up, I saw why. I tried to get her attention, but the timing was poor, obviously," she remembers, a mildly wistful look in her beautiful green eyes. The longer she speaks, the more prominent her primarily Kiwi accent becomes.
    </p>
<p>
     "When I pulled her out, I felt a bit guilty, even though I knew it wasn't my fault. Even more guilty when I realized I dropped my own phone while trying to help her out of the water."
    </p>
<p>
     Listening to her explain this, it feels as though they're whisking me away to a time when technology and social media were merely a thought and nothing but human connection and interaction ultimately prevailed.'"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio paused in her reading, clearing her throat for a moment. It was clear that reading her own words and knowing that thousands, if not millions, of eyes were going to read the same thing had twister her nerves a bit, but she forged on.
    </p>
<p>
     ""So... I offered to dry her clothes for her so she could get on about her day. Which would have seemed like a normal and reasonable offer, but --" In the middle of her explaining, Agatha does not miss a beat as she cuts in, her hand tightening around the one in her hold.
    </p>
<p>
     "But her dryer hadn't been updated since the prehistoric ages and total run time was roughly three hours," she divulges, as though it is the most outrageous fact of life anyone could ever state aloud.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, that. So she showered and we wound up on the deck with wine," Rio tells me, though Agatha is looking like she's about to burst apart into beams of light as she watches her wife speak with vivid fascination written all over her face. "We sat on the deck for hours, just... talking. About life, our children, and existentialism like we were discussing the weather."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head whips to me as she informs me of something that seems important to her. "Then she even cooked for me."
    </p>
<p>
     Truly, in those moments I realize that I am seeing an entirely new facet of the Golden Ruler of Hollywood. For so long, she has treated the industry like her kingdom, monopolizing on her successes while never once buckling in her surly and staunch rule. Here she sits in front of me, looking every bit of the in-love and softened version of herself that I believe is only visible when she is beside the woman she had vowed to spend the rest of her life with.'"
    </p>
<p>
     Although the way Rio's smile was audible in her voice as she read those words, the way Agatha wrapped her arm around Rio's back and pulled her closer only made that smile grow. When Agatha kissed her cheek and encouraged her to keep going, it was so wide that she was almost certain it was going to crack.
    </p>
<p>
     The truth was, it was startling to see someone else talk about Agatha that way that did not have a direct tie to their family. She had glanced at snippets and headlines a couple of times since their return home, and nothing even remotely similar had ever been published about Agatha before.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio inhaled and then proceeded.
    </p>
<p>
     "'As Rio continues, there is a gentle reminiscent air that settles over the two of them, almost making them glow a little brighter. "We ate, talked more, drank more. It was just... peaceful. By the time it had gotten dark and we finished eating, I knew it was likely that her clothes were dry. We went inside to check, and I was right. But then..."
    </p>
<p>
     "Then," Rio begins, but I do not miss the way her hand has moved to Agatha's arm in a show of support and comfort. "Agatha took the glass of water she had been drinking and she threw it inside. She closed the door, pressed the button and looked me right in the eye when she told me they needed more time."
    </p>
<p>
     For someone who has developed a steeled and frozen demeanor throughout her twenty plus year long career, this is certainly a lighter and more romantic side to be witnessing and hearing about from the proclaimed Wild Witch of Hollywood.
    </p>
<p>
     "We ended up watching a documentary and I fell asleep," Agatha decides to pick up, her eyes alight with the memory. "And the next morning when I woke up... She was making a breakfast that I knew I couldn't stay for. I knew that my assistant was likely losing his mind with no contact. The friend I had been on the phone with was probably terrified. I needed to put out those fires as soon as possible."
    </p>
<p>
     As I listen, I envision how this goes. They exchange numbers, keep in touch, perhaps visit one another to keep things alive.
    </p>
<p>
     I realize pretty quickly that I am very, very misguided.'"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio found herself stopping to giggle again, glancing over at Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, we are
     <em>
      so
     </em>
     Team Caprice in this house," Rio informed her, still unable to bat away the laugher. "She's got a very... poignant way with words."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha huffed a soft grunt, rolling her eyes. "You just like her because she is... How does Estee say it? 'Reading me for filth?'"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's laughter elevated in both amusement and joy at this and she leaned into Agatha's hold, tipping her head to bump affectionately against Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
     "Keep going, keep going," Agatha muttered, though she sweetly gave Rio a gentle squeeze in spite of her grumbling.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, okay so... Where were we..." came Rio's low hum as a finger scanned the words mid-air. "Aha! Okay. 'Agatha sits up a little straighter before she presses on, though what she has to say it a little more heartbreaking than any preparation would have been suitable for. "So, I got dressed in the dry clothes she had left folded for me and I went out to greet her and then say my goodbyes. Which... Maybe it would have been normal if we were anyone else, but..."
    </p>
<p>
     In the middle of her speaking, I watch with interest as Rio simply turns her head and beholds her wife with such understanding and respect that it is almost surreal to accept the idea that we as humans are capable of wearing such an expression fueled by such an emotion.'"
    </p>
<p>
     For just a moment, Rio had to stop so that she could clear her throat of the emotion that had started to well there. This woman had not known them as a couple before they walked into that room. She very clearly had already developed an impression of Agatha, one that Caprice was sure to qualify was still there, but was only absent in Rio's presence.
    </p>
<p>
     She lifted her chin a bit, as if she had gained a modicum of composure so she could keep reading.
    </p>
<p>
     "'There is a slight hesitance between them, as if they know some big secret that they are not sure how to reveal, but Agatha finds a way to try. "But... When I went to thank her and offer farewells, I realized that I... I realized I did not know her name. And..."
    </p>
<p>
     Before I am able to develop any questions to even try to ask, Rio is quick to fill the empty space.
    </p>
<p>
     "And I panicked," she reveals.
    </p>
<p>
     At this point, their arms are wound and their grip on one another's hands has not wavered even once through their retelling of their origins.
    </p>
<p>
     "I turned the sentiment back on her and... We accidently set a precedent that we didn't mean to." Rio turns to look at me by the time Agatha speaks next.
    </p>
<p>
     "And I left without knowing her name."
    </p>
<p>
     Upon first sitting down with them, I am not quite so sure as to what it was that they were going to tell me, but that far into it, hearing that line causes the most heavy feeling to settle in my chest. I clearly can see that it is not where their story ends, but hearing such a sentiment feels only half as devastating as I imagine it might have for them.
    </p>
<p>
     It somehow hurts a little more when she informs me that she did not go back.'"
    </p>
<p>
     By this point, the silent tears had already started to spill down Rio's cheeks, though in her focus on the iPad, Agatha had not noticed. It was true that Rio did not know this woman and would likely never be friends with her, but there was such a deeply seated sense of respect for her craft and how good she was at it.
    </p>
<p>
     One more breath. They had almost reached the end of their beginning.
    </p>
<p>
     "'Rio is quick in her correction, nudging Agatha in a light reminder. "Not true," she states.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's expression softens and then, a sheepish smile finds her well. "Right, right, I did go back. And she wasn't home."
    </p>
<p>
     Very quickly, I start to understand a bit more; everything they had just shared with me had only happened in the span of a night. One single night.
    </p>
<p>
     When Agatha speaks again, her voice is firmer and holds a little more strength than her admission of a missed opportunity.
    </p>
<p>
     "I had no paper, no pen. I didn't even have a business card on me. But what I did have was an earring. So... I took it off, put the back on it and hung it on the post at the end of the dock to the houseboat. I knew it was a hail Mary, and that it was idiotic, but... Something made me do it."
    </p>
<p>
     There is something about the look on Agatha's face that informs me she knows exactly how wild it sounds, but that she remains steadfast in the decision.
    </p>
<p>
     I watch with vested interest as Rio comforts her wife with a soft squeeze of her arm and continues on where Agatha left off.
    </p>
<p>
     "I found it the same night but I... was not so quick to catch on. In fact... I figured she lost it and someone had simply pinned it there to be found. I spent... the next couple of weeks with it tucked in my jewelry box." She hesitates for a moment, a clear appreciation suddenly filling her as she begins again. "I had told my daughter, who was twenty-one at the time, about what had happened. When she came home on her break, we talked about it briefly but otherwise just tried to enjoy our time together. Which, we did. And she... The genius she is, she left it alone right up until I was taking her to the airport so she could go back to uni."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's grin sweeps across her face in a dazzling reveal as she interjects animatedly, glancing just briefly at her wife. "I feel like 'genius' is really underselling it sometimes."
    </p>
<p>
     They both chuckle at this, causing me to realize how true the statement must be.
    </p>
<p>
     "In that conversation, I told her about the earring. I was insistent it was just something that was lost, that it meant nothing. Then..." Rio stalls for just one moment before a bright smile fills her face, her eyes brightening when she speaks again. "Then, she asked me a question that made me realize it meant
     <em>
      everything.
     </em>
     She asked me if the back was still on the earring. And... It was."
    </p>
<p>
     The more I hear, the more they decide to tell me, the more I begin to wonder if Agatha is the director of this movie, after all.'"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio paused her reading again to glance beside her, a light curl of her lips happening as Agatha caught the movement and met her gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     "She very clearly respects you. And from what you've told me, that's hard to come by with relationships like these, so it makes me happy that the world gets to see it, too," Rio informed her, leaning in to steal the quickest kiss before resuming the work before her.
    </p>
<p>
     "'It is what Rio tells me next that almost surprises me the most.
    </p>
<p>
     "It took me a little bit of time, but with some convincing from who Agatha likes to call 'the greatest wing-woman in the world,' I booked a flight for LA with nothing more than an office address in my pocket." Now, it's her turn to wear an expression that communicates that she is entirely aware of how illogical it sounds when she says it out loud.
    </p>
<p>
     When I ask her how it turned out, she starts to laugh. It's sudden and a little loud, but it is so very bright. I understand why immediately.
    </p>
<p>
     "I am pretty sure her security guy was ready to call the police on me," she remembers, leaning a little closer to me as if she is telling me a secret. "So... I gave up. I wrote her a note with a name she didn't know, an out-of-country phone number and, in some form of blind hope, I drew the
     <em>
      worst
     </em>
     little boat as if it might have been an obvious showing that some insane woman had flown thousands of miles for one more second of her time."
    </p>
<p>
     It is in that very moment that I decide this is what blind faith mixed with gut instinct looks like.
    </p>
<p>
     When I look to Agatha and question if it had worked the way Rio intended it to, she is grinning once more when she responds.
    </p>
<p>
     "It didn't have to," she returns without hesitation. "When she was leaving, I was coming back. And I... saw her at the top of the stairs. And it was the strangest mix of feelings. It felt like I was being electrocuted, sedated, and had been on a four day bender all at the same time. And the only thing I was physically capable of in those moments was just... Going to her."
    </p>
<p>
     There is this gleam in Agatha's eyes which are looking somewhere just over my shoulder. I can see as she pictures the images in her mind, as she stows away to those moments for just a few seconds before her attention comes back to our task.'"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was smiling, and Agatha could hear it, but she did not stop reading to indulge in the laughter she was trying to hold in.
    </p>
<p>
     "'A soft laugh escapes Rio before she offers her perspective. "It was magnetic. I was moving at the same time she was and we met at the bottom of the stairs. She had kissed me before she left my home that day... But that kiss, at the bottom of the stairs to her office... That one was the first one of the rest of our lives."
    </p>
<p>
     This is romance.
    </p>
<p>
     This is meeting someone and simply knowing they are meant to be a part of your life and showing the initiative to make it happen.
    </p>
<p>
     It has very clearly worked out for them.'"
    </p>
<p>
     While it was nowhere near the end of the article, Rio took a moment to stop and turn to her wife that she loved so wholly and so dearly. Her hand raised, fingertips gracing Agatha's cheek so softly, beckoning her to look at her. Once obliged, Rio took a soft but prolonged kiss, one where she tried to tell Agatha what it meant to be reading those statements without using any words of her own.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you more than anything,"
     </em>
     Rio whispered softly against her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Almost anything. You can never love me as much as I love you,"
     </em>
     Agatha teased back, taking one more kiss before Rio resumed.
    </p>
<p>
     It took about ten minutes to finish the rest of the article and while overall it was a beautiful piece, Caprice had undeniably garnered not only respect, but appreciation as well from Rio. Even before she asked Agatha her opinion, Rio was of the opinion that what had been written had been a true and honest telling of who they were as a couple.
    </p>
<p>
     She did not lock the iPad screen, but did lean into Agatha once they had finished, her head landing in the cradle of the crook of Agatha's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     "How are you feeling about that?" Rio asked her softly.
    </p>
<p>
     "The photo placements were brilliant for the sections they were put in. And --"
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Rio cut, gently grabbing Agatha's side between them. "You know what I mean."
    </p>
<p>
     A soft sigh fell from her lips and Rio could feel it as her chest deflated, sinking her posture slightly as Agatha held her close.
    </p>
<p>
     "I appreciate that she doesn't miss a chance to assert that this is only a direct relation to you. And I... like the little lie she added at the end about me yelling at one of the interns on the way out. It helped me save a little face, I think," Agatha informed with a light chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     "Ah, yes. Maintaining the Ice Cold Bitch thing is super important," Rio mused with a soft laugh, though she could practically
     <em>
      feel
     </em>
     Agatha roll her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha started to say something, but the iPad dinged with a new sound Rio did not recognize. Her gaze dropped to the screen where there was a notification at the top of the page. She swiped down to view it, her brow winkling at what she saw. Rio didn't understand it.
    </p>
<p>
     "
     <b>
      head4harkness
     </b>
     tagged you in a post.
     <br/>
     |"wifey is that you? 👀" "
    </p>
<p>
     She clicked on it to see what else there was. Attached to the post was a screenshot of another notification, one that head4harkness probably had about 100 of, at the very least.
    </p>
<p>
     "
     <b>
      rioharkness-vidal
     </b>
     liked your post."
    </p>
<p>
     Immediately Rio's head dropped between her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     Busted.
    </p>
<p>
     "Your URL is your
     <em>
      full name
     </em>
     ?" Agatha questioned, the disbelief thick in her words. She looked so beautiful when she balked at the sometimes very idiotic things Rio could do in relation to the current state of the world. It was still cute, and Rio was almost certain it made Agatha love her even more.
    </p>
<p>
     "No," Rio answered in a pout. "I left out my middle name."
    </p>
<p>
     "You're ridiculous," Agatha chided, leaning to press a kiss to the side of Rio's head. "And also totally caught."
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, they both sat in silence as they stared at the screen and the very obvious waving of hello from someone who had appreciated Agatha for a very, very long time.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been running through various ways to respond in her head when Agatha's voice sliced right through the frenzied chaos that was filling Rio's mind.
    </p>
<p>
     "I think you should message them," she voiced, though it sounded like she really meant it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's brow wrinkled slightly and she turned her head, meeting Agatha evenly as the question had clearly written itself on her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "You've clearly been caught. You could either ignore it, or we can just say hello. I've looked at it. It's clean, tasteful, respectful. It seems... Appreciative more than obsessive," Agatha pointed out. Rio knew it was actually a fair assessment; there was nothing that had ever been posted that had been unbecoming or had shed any kind of a negative light on Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio debated for just a moment before she began to navigate the app, pulling up the page and then the message option. As the keyboard appeared at the bottom of the screen, her lips pressed and her finger hovered aimlessly in the air for the longest moment of hesitation.
    </p>
<p>
     "What do I even say?" Rio asked, looking over at Agatha again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Maybe start with... 'hi?' Anything after an initial greeting is fair game," Agatha teased, causing Rio to roll her eyes in response.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio typed those two letters, then hit the paper plane.
    </p>
<p>
<b>
      rioharkness-vidal:

<p>
     Her follow-up was quick.

<p>
<b>
      rioharkness-vidal:
     </b>
     You caught me.
    </p>
<p>
     "Now we wait," she announced, reaching up to lock the screen. Staring at it wasn't going to make head4harkness respond any faster.
    </p>
<p>
     When she felt Agatha's fingertip on the far side of her jaw, she turned toward her in compliance but they both froze at the sound of a tumblr notification from the iPad. Immediately, both pairs of lips were twisting into wicked grins.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's hand dropped and they both returned their attention to the iPad as Rio reopened the message.
    </p>
<p>
<b>
      head4harkness:
     </b>
     'you're lying.'
    </p>
<p>

      rioharkness-vidal:

<p>

      head4harkness:
     </b>
     theres no way. prove it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio glanced up at Agatha to question how they hell they might manage such an ask, but Agatha was already grinning.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hang on," she voiced, scrambling over to her nightstand to retrieve a small notebook and a pen. Once she had gotten what she needed, Agatha placed herself right back against Rio's side, opening the notebook in front of them. "This might be stupid because people on the internet are actually insane sometimes, but... I don't know. What could it hurt?" she mused, scrawling something on the paper. When she sat back, Rio grinned down at the message Agatha had left.
    </p>
<p>
     'Hi, head4harkness! Have a good day! :)'
    </p>
<p>
     A delighted giggle escaped Rio as she reached over to steal the pen from Agatha's grasp. She pulled the notebook over and wrote her own, smirking almost the entire time.
    </p>
<p>
     'Hi head4harkness, your URL is something i strive for every day :D'
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Agatha saw it, she actually gasped.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio!" she practically shouted. "Absolutely not!"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was laughing so hard it was verging on the point of not being able to breathe. It took her just a moment longer to regain her composure, soothing her amusement with measured breaths.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay okay, fine," she playfully grumbled, flipping the page to write something else. "Better?" she asked, pushing the notebook back toward Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     'Hi head4harkness. Please keep posting young Agatha pics. My messages are always open to you too. :D'
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio, you're exhausting," Agatha sighed, though she clearly sounded tickled in the way that she was trying not to laugh and offer encouragement.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, marriage is a bartering system, right?" she teased back, pecking Agatha on the cheek so fast Agatha almost missed it.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio ripped the page out, bringing open the camera app on the iPad to see Agatha already grinning like a fool next to her. It was nice to know that she found amusement in her wife's naivety and innocence instead of frustration or anger.
    </p>
<p>
     They each held up their respective papers, smiling like the lovesick fools they were as Rio snapped the picture. They were both laughing and repeating how silly it was as Rio pulled the message back up and sent over the photographic proof that a) she had, indeed, been busted and b) she was not, in fact, lying.
    </p>
<p>
     And then they waited.
    </p>
<p>
     And waited.
    </p>
<p>
     After 20 minutes of no response, they had decided to close the iPad and discuss what Agatha would do for the rest of the day.
    </p>
<p>
     Ultimately, she had cancelled the majority of what had been on her list for the day, though she did say she was going to attend two video conferences with Jack for something he was working on later on in the day.
    </p>
<p>
     They'd lazed around, celebrating the success of the interview in terms of how it had been handled and the light it had shed on their lives.
    </p>
<p>
     The world now knew who Rio Harkness-Vidal was.
    </p>
<p>
     In that public eye, they also knew that Agatha Harkness loved her endlessly.
    </p>
<p>
     After a short nap, they had taken the time to wake up by indulging in cuddles and closeness, soft hums and murmurs of needing to do things exchanged between them. Rio had just about convinced herself to get out of bed when that notification sounded again, several hours after the first time they'd heard it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mmmm, check it!"
     </em>
     Agatha urged, releasing her hold on Rio so that she could grab the iPad from her nightstand. She scooted away from Agatha enough that she could place it on the bed between them, opening the message.
    </p>
<p>
     Instantly, they both began to laugh.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      head4harkness:
     </strong>
     hey so. sorry for the late response. i think i passed out. but so anyway, holy shit it's nice to meet you both.
    </p>
<p>
     A moment later, another message appeared.
    </p>

     jsyk, i am entirely unworthy but your privacy is safe with me. i can guarantee that.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a sweet sentiment and they both appreciated it, but they hadn't realized that she was prefacing something else.
    </p>
<p>
     Not until the video came through.
    </p>
<p>
     Upon seeing the still, they were both confused, but Rio quickly pressed the play button.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a very, very old video that had clearly been imported to digital. Immediately, Agatha's voice sounded from the speaker, though it was a little higher pitched. Still, it was apparent in her shouting that it was her, even before she walked into frame.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh my fucking
     <em>
      GOD,"
     </em>
     Agatha breathed next to her, her eyes wide. "This is from
     <em>
      college.
     </em>
     How in the fucking world does she have this?!"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was sort-of listening, but she was mostly paying attention to college Agatha as she walked around, pointing at different spots on the floor as she yelled at different students, instructing them what to do and how to do it right. It might have been some collegiate production, but in that footage it was clear Agatha took it seriously.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio, ask her where she got this right now," Agatha prompted and while Rio was still grinning, she did as she was told.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      rioharkness-vidal:
     </strong>
     Sooo... Agatha would like to know
     <br/>
     where you got this from. If you don't
     <br/>
     mind sharing your source.
    </p>
<p>
     There was only about a minute before head4harkness responded.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      head4harkness:
     </strong>
     'Thalia Jones.'
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha nearly froze next to Rio, this time the one to take the iPad.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      rioharkness-vidal:
     </strong>
     How do you know Thalia?
     <br/>
     This is Agatha btw.
    </p>
<p>
     And answer came that both seemed to bring Agatha a sense of recognition, but also a sense of pain.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      head4harkness:
     </strong>
     'she was my mom.'
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha?" Rio asked softly, brow pinching slightly above her nose.
    </p>
<p>
     "I... I went to college with her mom," Agatha responded, her gaze tearing away from the iPad screen to meet Rio's.
    </p>
<p>
     "Like...
     <em>
      went to college
     </em>
     or just went to college?" Rio questioned, though her smirk had started to form.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did not have a crush on her. We were just friends. But... judging by the past tense usage, I assume she's since passed." There was something in Agatha's voice that sounded sad, like it was something that hadn't directly impacted her life for a long while and yet, learning about it still crushed something in her.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      rioharkness-vidal:
     </strong>
     I am truly sorry for your loss. But
     <br/>
     we are very happy to make your acquaintance.
     <br/>
     And thank you for not sharing that video publicly.
     <br/>
     Much appreciated.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio huffed a gentle laugh through her nose, unable to keep from rolling her eyes again at Agatha's antics.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      head4harkness:
     </strong>
     'thank you. it's been a few
     <br/>
     years, but i still miss her. we can talk
     <br/>
     about that at another time (hopefully?)
     <br/>
     but thank you both for responding. you
     <br/>
     seriously might have made my entire year.
     <br/>
     i hope you have a great rest of your night (:'
    </p>
<p>
     This time, Rio took the iPad back and typed her response.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>
      rioharkness-vidal:
     </strong>
     No, thank YOU. (I meant what
     <br/>
     I said about those pics, please don't stop
     <br/>
     posting them) Hope you have the best night!
    </p>
<p>
     With it sent, Rio locked the iPad and stowed it on the nightstand. When she turned back to Agatha in front of her on the bed, she had a happy but slightly emotional look written on her face.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You alright, my love?"
     </em>
     Rio asked her quietly as Agatha's eyes flickered back to life, locating Rio's face.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Yeah, yeah. I just... Mortality creeps up on you at the strangest times. We were the same age. Just... something to think about, that's all."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It was an observation of the facts, but Rio could see that there was something a little more there. Right then did not feel like the time to push.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Let's save the mortality and existentialism crises for stargazing later, hm?"
     </em>
     Rio mused softly, leaning forward to kiss her wife.
     <em>
      "For now, you're going to attend your meetings and I'm going to make us some gnocchi for dinner. And then we are going to drink wine and watch a movie. How does that sound?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Their lips were still close as Agatha breathed her earnest response.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It sounds like another day in heaven with you."
     </em>

     </em>
</p>
<p>
     There was a fascination that Rio had developed with the operation of their lives and how it was not unlike clockwork. It was a clock that could still work when a smaller cog was temporarily displaced, or even two. Did it work better when all parts were present and accounted for? Of course, as all things did, but their family had come to be a machine that could never and would never stop.
    </p>
<p>
     The night before, with Hēmi's arrival, their clock was whole and in perfect working order.
    </p>
<p>
     Any other week, a Wednesday would not have seemed like a significant day of the week. That Wednesday was a special one; it was the day that the Harkness-Vidals were going to attend their very first film premiere as a family.
    </p>
<p>
     Over the weekend, Agatha had sent the children out with her black AmEx card and instructed them to acquire outfits for the event with the advice that Nicky would be able to assist the girls on securing something that would be appropriate.
    </p>
<p>
     With an arm finding its way around Agatha's back as the two of them watched the kids collect their things and stagger out of the house, Rio found a rather unfamiliar tide of anticipation rolling in her stomach. This was something new for them, something that out of the six of them, only Agatha and Nicky had experienced before.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a conversation that had popped up quite frequently since it had first been penned into the calendar.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had explained the first few that there was no real way to truly lay out and define what events like these could entail. There were the typical motions of the red carpet, photos, socializing. There were typically media interviews, but as her involvement in the project had been rather low-key, she had informed Rio that Dave had managed to circumvent press for her for the time being.
    </p>
<p>
     This was a way to dip their toes into the vast pool of Agatha's fame without plunging right in. It was a way for them to explore this new facet of their lives as a complete unit with a lowered sense of pressure. It was not one of Agatha's projects, it was not something that was high-stakes for her in the sense that she had her reputation riding on it, and as such it afforded them more of an opportunity to feel it out at their own pace.
    </p>
<p>
     In her many pep-talks throughout the week, Agatha had also informed Rio that there would be an after party once she screening was over and that they were more than welcome to attend if they so chose. Surely the kids would want to go and the more Rio considered it, the more she realized it might be a good idea for herself and Agatha to attend, too.
    </p>
<p>
     "Most of the time, after parties are rather tame. It's the after-after parties that venture into morally questionable," Agatha assured her.
    </p>
<p>
     They were back to back in their closet the Sunday before the premiere, standing on one another's side as they thumbed through dress after dress and suit after suit in an attempt to find attire that would speak to who they were as a married couple when the world was so very used to who Agatha Harkness had always been.
    </p>
<p>
     "And are you wanting to attend the after-after party?" Rio inquired playfully as she glanced over at Agatha's back for the briefest second before returning her attention to her leisurely perusing of Agatha's clothing.
    </p>
<p>
     "You already know the answer to that," Agatha responded flatly, though by the lack of fluctuation in her tone, Rio could tell than she had not looked behind her.
    </p>
<p>
     "I do. Which is why I had to ask. I can't be nice to you always," Rio returned lightly.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're telling me you know how to be mean?" Agatha shot, voice sounding a little closer as she did turn her head that time. When Rio looked back, she realized Agatha had actually turned her entire body all the way around and was wearing a viciously tickled grin.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's brow pinched as she dropped her arms and turned around, putting her hands on her hips defiantly. "I absolutely know how to be mean," she stated, weight shifting as If it might make her appear bigger, more imposing than she actually was.
    </p>
<p>
     If the sound that came out of Agatha in response to such a statement would have sounded any more like a scoff, she would have found out that Rio was a little more than capable of being mean, but it mixed heavily with a laugh. It was enough to disguise Agatha's total disbelief and enough to keep Rio from growing irritated in some form of indignance.
    </p>
<p>
     "You should prove it," Agatha challenged, that grin only seeming to grow.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio blinked at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "And how should I prove that I know how to be mean, Agatha?" came Rio's request for clarification.
    </p>
<p>
     "Be mean to me," Agatha stated plainly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha, don't even," Rio groaned, rolling her head with vigor as she spun around into her previous position so she could continue her search for the outfit she wanted Agatha to wear Wednesday night.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, come on," Agatha pressed. "You know, I've seen you grouchy. And even a little cranky. But..."
    </p>
<p>
     Her voice sounded like it was getting closer, but Rio remained focused on the clothing in front of her right up until the point that she felt Agatha's hands land on her sides and slide around her middle, wrapping around her firmly. In the same rush of movement, Agatha's face landed in Rio's hair, a devious hum slipping from between her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have not ever seen you angry."
    </p>
<p>
     She wasn't wrong; it wasn't so much that Rio didn't get angry as it was the fact that it took a lot to get her there. She could be disgruntled, she could be annoyed or upset, but for her to find true anger, it had to be over something that was genuinely worth it. If Rio was going to expend the energy it took to show pure anger, she was absolutely going to need a damn good reason.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mmm, perhaps you should be thankful for that," Rio mused, paying no further attention to the way Agatha had come to cage her body within her hold.
    </p>
<p>
     "Tell me about one time you got angry," Agatha beguiled, her nose pressing to the side of Rio's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why are you so interested in me being pissed off?" she returned. She had been trying to main an air of indifference, but the softest giggle left her without permission.
    </p>
<p>
     "'Cause I bet it's hot," Agatha ventured, digging lightly into the left side of Rio's ribcage with playfully antagonistic fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     "If I ever encounter a situation that genuinely angers me, it's not going to be sexy," Rio informed her, pushing a couple of Agatha's suits aside to continue her search. "Plus, the last time I got angry, the only one who got hurt was me." Her hand retracted from the clothing to indicate the small scar above her eyebrow. "I ran into a doorframe because I was mad and wasn't paying attention. And that's why it's stupid to get mad. Because it makes you do really idiotic shit that you would not otherwise do."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel Agatha's laughter against her neck by means of her breath, but also in the way Agatha's body trembled with it ever so slightly.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha released a warm, sweet sounding hum as she pressed her face firmly into the crook of Rio's neck, seemingly not bothered by the barrier of hair that lay between.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you ever rationalize so hard you break your brain in the process?" Her question was muffled with the way she was situated with her face in Rio's hair, but it came out intelligible enough. Finally, she had poked a hole in Rio's steel resolve and it showed in her tamed laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, I just prioritize how and where I deposit my emotions."
    </p>
<p>
     And that, Rio knew, was exactly why Agatha had fallen in love with her. It wasn't just the anger. It was the attraction, the love, the lust, the care, the compassion. Rio's currency was her emotions, each and every one of them, and she had spent the last eleven months making countless deposits into the Bank of Agatha, knowing that her treasures would be stored safely there.
    </p>
<p>
     An exhaled grunt slipped between Agatha's lips as she lifted her head and let her chin rest on Rio's shoulder, watching as she continued to sort through clothes even if she had stopped paying attention to what she was doing.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are so frustrating in that you're so painfully mature in ways I do not understand and yet it just makes me love you more," Agatha offered, her head tipping to the side to bump gently into Rio's.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio considered this for a moment. She knew she didn't
     <em>
      have
     </em>
     to provide any kind of qualifier, but she wanted to.
    </p>
<p>
     "I had a very long time to myself where I took the time to appropriately assess what was important to me and the best ways to protect my peace. Anyone encroaching on my daughter, and now my family? Those are anger-worthy offenses." Rio had desisted her task momentarily as her hand dropped to land on Agatha's arm, thumb brushing tenderly over her skin. "Maybe a couple of things about work. But... Most everything else can be rationalized and processed."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's chin lifted and she turned her head, pressing her lips to Rio's cheek. It wasn't a quick kiss and she left them there for several seconds. The only reason the contact was broken was because Agatha had chosen to speak.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You fascinate me more and more each day."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     This brought a smile to Rio's lips, Agatha's appreciation warming her like a comforting fire on a cold night.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Have ta' keep ya' on your toes somehow. Now go on, make your selection and leave me be!"
     </em>
     she urged in jest, giving Agatha's arm a light squeeze. Any attempt at seriousness was washed away with her phrasing, leaving them to dissolve together into amused snickering.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha adhered and released her to return to her own search, but not before offering a hefty smack to Rio's right asscheek.
    </p>
<p>
     It had only taken them twenty more minutes, but they had each settled on a selection for the other.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay. We turn around at the same time," Agatha announced, her giddiness bleeding in her tone in regards to the selection she had made.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright, fine," Rio answered, her own grin audible in her tone. She was pleased with her decision and knew Agatha would be, too. "I'll count us down. Three... Two... One!"
    </p>
<p>
     The moment she hit the beat, they both spun and Rio's gaze landed on her proud and maybe also slightly arrogant wife, clutching that stunning red dress Rio had never seen before in her life. It was an off the shoulder piece, one that appeared to have an additional side piece for the other half of her chest, but would also leave her entire right side bare and exposed. There was also a very, very obvious slit up the left side that would end right below her hip.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was grinning before it made sense to have such a reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     "And what the hell is that?" Rio teased through laughter that was both flattered and positively delighted.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh? This? I found it in the back of your closet," Agatha answered, doing a terrible job of being convincing.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's a good thing you never tried to pursue acting," Rio informed her with a knowing tip of her head. "You're really bad at it. You bought that for this event, didn't you?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha glanced down at the back of the dress, her lips forming a downward arch in her mockingly thorough inspection. "Maybe. But. Either way, will you tell me no?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's lips rubbed briefly in consideration before she formed her answer. "Of course not. Plus, I
     <em>
      do
     </em>
     look good in red."
    </p>
<p>
     "I know you do," Agatha agreed, a smirk creeping up her lips. Her head tipped back at Rio's own selection in question, her gaze following down her nose to inspect. "And what have you there?"
    </p>
<p>
     Proudly, Rio held up the black blazer, the matching pants hung haphazardly over her arm. Dangling from her left hand was a black leather bralette that would sit nicely beneath the blazer while still showcasing only appropriate bits of Agatha's abdomen and sternum.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's own grin was instant and full of emotion, her eyes alight with the thrill she felt at understanding how Rio wanted to see her when they were side by side on display for the whole world to bear witness.
    </p>
<p>
     Surprisingly, they had remained relatively tasteful despite how feral they could sometimes be. Unsurprisingly, they had completely
     <em>
      nailed
     </em>
     the assignment. It was yet another example on the endless list of how they just simply got one another. They took in the context of the outing, the purpose of their mission, and what it was they wanted or needed the rest of the world to see, too.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a sentiment that had been founded for their wedding and now, it would continue forth and become something more, a way for them to have silent conversations with themselves but also with the world. Maybe no one would ever know their little tradition, but it didn't matter. The image that would be beheld by spectators was one specifically curated by them and while it was
     <em>
      for
     </em>
     them first and foremost, those choices had voices in their own rights.
    </p>
<p>
     Anticipation seemed to grow every day within Rio's being, her mind often wandering over what it might all possibly look like and feel like to actually experience. This was something she had never even dreamed of. Industry and fame had not ever been something she willingly sought out, but now there were photos of her on websites and her words had been printed by a major publication. Now, she was going to mingle with a great deal of people whose names and careers she did not know in support of her wife and their friends because she could, and because she wanted to.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee had already asked her a couple of times if she wanted to do a crash course in celebrity faces and names, but Rio had dismissed her easily, stating with certainty that she was going to be just fine.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they were loading into the back of the limo that Gio had shown up in late Wednesday afternoon, Rio was not entirely sure she still held such a conviction.
    </p>
<p>
     The only thing that seemed to be circling her mind was simply not doing anything to embarrass her wife. Agatha had already assured her at least eleven times since noon that she was fine and that this would be an easy and fun night out, one where they would get to enjoy a little attention, a decent (but she really meant great, she just like giving Jack shit) film and an after party where they could spend time with friends and drink pricey alcohol. It was a night to step out of the reality of what life had once been and embrace what it would grow to be.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright!" Agatha declared, slapping her palms to her knees in a shot of sound that was intended to draw attention. "Who here needs a pep talk?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze swept around both sides of the car, over the pair of young women and then the pair of young men who were sitting opposite each other. Not a single one of them looked like they had been touched with nerves within the last forty-eight hours. Instead, they looked like works of art in their gowns and formal wear.
    </p>
<p>
     The black dress that Estee had chosen was positively stunning while maintaining an expected level of class at such an outing. It was collared, the fabric laying in a manner that formed an oval of bare skin over her sternum. Those pieces rejoined, the sides cut out to reveal the curve of her sides before covering her hips down in a loose, flowing skirt portion. Her hair was loosely curled and her makeup was tame for the most part, but it allowed her true beauty to really shine.
    </p>
<p>
     Next to her, Tay was just as much of a sight in her gold and sheer dress that Agatha had insisted on her having tailored to fit her exactly right. It had been the right call because she looked phenomenal. The thin straps over her shoulders dropped into a bosom piece that was crusted with jewels before a cheer midsection revealed more of the intricate pattern on the dress, gold and black lines woven intentionally for visual purposes. There was a slit over the left leg, showcasing those gold heels that shone even in the back of that limo.
    </p>
<p>
     Of the six of them, Nicky was probably the most underdressed, but that was par for the course for him, Agatha had informed Rio. He was still wearing a button down that was patterned with odd splotches of color over a black main space. Over that, he was wearing a dark navy blazer that matched his slacks. On his feet were probably the nicest pair of tennis shoes Rio had ever seen. He looked so casual, so cool and like this was something he had done time and time again.
    </p>
<p>
     There next to him, almost comically, Hēmi was alight with a grin and clearly thrilled to be there despite the fact that the tuxedo he was in was miles more formal than what his boyfriend chosen. The look on his face said that he did not care one bit and he was just thankful to have been asked to accompany them. It struck Rio just how lucky they were to have him and the time he wanted to share with them. He was a great man, he made Nicky happy, and nothing felt quite as perfect as it did when he was with them.
    </p>
<p>
     "No one?" Agatha pressed a little harder, eyeing them each individually as they shook their heads, one-by-one, in response. Finally, her deep blue gaze landed on her wife. Rio was suspiciously not looking at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Absolutely no one?" she offered like they were at an auction and she were calling for a last bid.
    </p>
<p>
     All four pairs of other eyes had landed directly on Rio. Consequently, her skin began to flush with the sudden heat as if they were all pinning her with lasers.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm fine!" she insisted, managing to gather enough nerve to look over at Agatha in that undeniably delicious suit. Rio said that, but then looking at Agatha in exactly what Rio had wanted her in, she knew it was going to be the purest form of self-torture to keep her hands to herself throughout the night. "I know the spiel. Don't say anything embarrassing. Make Dave's life easy. No overt PDA. No --"
    </p>
<p>
     "That one. That one hard," Nicky chimed in. The grin he was wearing was telling that he was being humorous, but they all knew how squirmy he got in relation to the topic anyway.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not too much alcohol and Nicky has your shoes and Estee has mine," Rio finished, wiggling up a little in pride that she had managed to keep track of her little list of rules for the evening.
    </p>
<p>
     "Trust me on the shoe thing. You'd be crying for flats an hour in."
    </p>
<p>
     "It's almost like you've done this before," Rio returned, quirking a brow playfully with a toothy grin of awe.
    </p>
<p>
     "Okay, so. On that note. The main goal is to have fun tonight."
    </p>
<p>
     That was actually a lie. It was just that Rio was the only one in the car who didn't know it.
    </p>
<p>
     Her family had been moving parts and pieces around to solidify them as the unit they were. Yes, they had hyphenated their last names and slapped it over the six of them combined with 'family' following right after. Rio had already mailed in the paperwork for her official name change, but she was still waiting for everything to be processed.
    </p>
<p>
     She had assumed that, for everyone else, they would figure it all out later.
    </p>
<p>
     What Rio was not aware of was that Estee had sent hers in the day after the wedding, and that both Nicky and Agatha had gone through the throes of filing for theirs as well.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was about to let her know in a very big way, as well as the rest of the world, but they had to go through the motions to get there.
    </p>
<p>
     "If anyone pukes, please make it to a toilet first. Preferably, don't get that drunk, but for four of you I understand this is both thrilling and nerve-wracking as fuck. So. Drink until you stop panicking then drink some water."
    </p>
<p>
     It was almost comical the way Agatha was delivering such instructions as though she were a drill sergeant leading her troops into battle. Rio understood why she took it seriously. More than that, she understood that this was very close to the core of what Agatha's life had always been and likely would be for the foreseeable future.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... Last call... Any questions?" she offered one last time. She didn't look at Rio again, but she did pick up her hand and secure it in both of her own.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have one," Estee offered, raising a hand like she were a child in school. "Did you run those outfits by Dave? If the answer is no, are you two capable of behaving?"
    </p>
<p>
     Both older women turned to one another out of sheepish guilt, but they were grinning by the time they settled on their daughter again.
    </p>
<p>
     "We are responsible adults, mija," Rio reminded her, finding it easy to not take offense to the giggle that came from Estee so freely.
    </p>
<p>
     "We'll see," Estee returned with one last soft laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     The conversation shifted to more idle chatter in the last minutes of the car ride, something that kept Rio idling without completely stalling. It was going to be fine. Everything was going to be great, and they were going to have a good time. If she kept repeating it, she just might be able to will it into reality.
    </p>
<p>
     When Gio rolled the car to a stop, Agatha's head had turned completely so she could survey the scene on the other side of the window. Her grip tightened around Rio's hand, but when she turned back the smile she was wearing was calm, but there was a flicker of excitement in her eyes. It had been almost a year since Agatha had found herself in such a circuit and it was clear that she was eager to jump right back in.
    </p>
<p>
     Something about that very fact was enough to instill a bit of bravery within Rio; this was what Agatha loved, and Rio was almost certain that she could learn to love it too.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a strange sense of euphoria that settled over her as she slid across the seat and slipped her hand into Agatha's, right where it was meant to be. For the first fifteen seconds of the contact, Rio felt Agatha's fingertips brushing softly over her wrist. Maybe Agatha was doing it for herself, but the act of her soothing that tattoo fortified something inside of Rio, too.
    </p>
<p>
     She could do this.
    </p>
<p>
     She
     <em>
      would
     </em>
     do this.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment they set forth into the fray, she absolutely
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     do it.
    </p>
<p>
     With Agatha to guide her and issue softly muttered instructions, it was simple enough to hold her hand, grin and pose with her for photos. It felt so easy to listen to
     <em>
      her
     </em>
     instead of all of the people shouting their names.
    </p>
<p>
     So many people knew their names.
    </p>
<p>
     For almost a month after meeting, they had not known one another's. Now, the whole world knew who they were, together. They knew who Rio was. There was this soft and poetic sense of romanticism that momentarily filled Rio at such a realization that
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     took her away, but she stowed it to reflect on at a later time. A later time when she did not have to be so present for her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     After their trek down the red carpet, they were met by a very sharply dressed Dave in a deep burgundy suit with black lapels who was wearing a very stern look of disapproval across his handsome features.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good evening, ladies. Am I going to have to start requiring that you run event outfits by me beforehand?" he questioned, those dark eyes darting back and forth between the two of them, causing their mischievous grins to grow.
    </p>
<p>
     "Whatever do you mean, David?" Agatha questioned, that air of disgustingly fake innocence giving her away on the spot.
    </p>
<p>
     "You need to be
     <em>
      responsible
     </em>
     this evening," he informed them, but while his gaze had started on Rio, it had landed on Agatha quickly and lingered. While Rio was fully aware that this was a newer facet of his job in that Agatha had never brought a date to a premiere before, let alone a spouse she was attracted to, she also knew that if anyone in the world knew Agatha best -- even above herself, honestly -- it was Dave.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, quit that," Agatha admonished, giving Rio's hand a sneaky squeeze as she continued. "I would never cause a ruckus and ruin something like this for Jack. We are here to support him."
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe she thought she sounded convincing, but Rio could already sense that Agatha had already made a mental map of where the restrooms were located from her previous experience. There was a chance it wouldn't be utilized tonight, but the more Agatha looked at her, the more Rio could see her realizing that she had shot herself in the foot with that dress choice.
    </p>
<p>
     Dave pressed on, offering another warning to Agatha, but Rio wasn't listening. Her head had turned and she was watching as Nicky led the gaggle of them down the carpet, instructing them what to do and how to stand for the people that were snapping photos.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a sweet moment on its own, but seeing the looks on the faces of Estee, Tay, and Hēmi caused a detonation of affection to occur in the center of Rio's chest. They looked so fucking happy, so thrilled to be given the chance to experience something so dreamlike that it had just never once seemed possible for who they were. They'd been there five minutes and those kids were already having the time of their lives.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey, you as well, focus!" Dave voiced, trying to draw Rio's attention. When he realized what it was that had distracted her, he apologized. "Sorry. Just. Can you two please behave tonight?"
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio's gaze landed back on him, she offered an agreeable curl of her lips that she chose to couple with a nod of understanding so he was well-informed that his point had been received. She would heed it, as well, for so long as she remembered it at least.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright. Now that I'm out of parent mode... Have fun tonight," Dave offered, his warm gaze settling on Rio. "It's an excuse to celebrate a new project, talent, and to just have a good time. I think you're really going to enjoy yourself."
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, Dave," Rio offered sincerely. "I think I am too."
    </p>
<p>
     He embraced both of them and offered light pecks to their cheeks before he departed, declaring that he would be keeping an eye on them like some well-paid babysitter. Which... That was pretty much exactly what he was.
    </p>
<p>
     He had been right, they had spent a bit of time socializing and while most of it had been with Jack and Thea or other familiar Landon related faces, Agatha had introduced Rio to a few new ones as well. She was trying to remember the different names and keep them matched up to the right faces, but it was turning out to be quite the task.
    </p>
<p>
     Before too long, they had been ushered into the theatre to find their seats. As it happened, they formed a straight line that turned out to be nothing more than pure convenience for Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     -Agatha. -Rio. -Dave. -Tay. -Estee. -Hēmi. -Nicky.
    </p>
<p>
     All in a line, perfectly splayed to enjoy the show.
    </p>
<p>
     And a few other things.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would give it to Agatha: She lasted almost an entire hour. They had been behaving, simply holding hands with the armrest pushed up between them. And then Agatha let go of Rio's hand. Then, she placed it on her thigh in a manner that left only half of her palm resting on red fabric, the other warm on smooth skin.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio did everything she could to not react. It was impossibly foolish for her to have thought that even with Dave's warning, Agatha would not try to pepper in some mischief throughout the course of their night.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a valiant effort, but Rio controlled her breathing, even as she felt Agatha's fingers slide inward, tucking between her thighs even in spite of the fact that they were pressed together. The moment she felt them curl around the thin strip of her G-string, she knew she was in trouble. She had been focusing  all of her energy on remaining as still as a statue, but it slipped the moment Agatha's touch sank lower and caused her to sharply inhale a breath.
    </p>
<p>
     Like lightning, Dave whipped forward and snapped his head to the side, pinning Agatha with a stare that could have sliced her clean in half, even in the darkness of the theatre.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I will fucking kill you,"
     </em>
     he hissed at her, leaving Rio torn between wanting to laugh or moan. Beside her, Agatha slouched in her silent tantrum, withdrawing her hand to leave it to rest on Rio's thigh, wet fingertips be damned.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeming to understand that he might actually be serious and not wanting to cause a scene by making Dave and Rio trade places, Agatha behaved herself the rest of the film. Well, mostly. That touch would occasionally inch closer and closer to the junction where Rio's thighs were pressed together from how her legs had crossed but never dared venture toward her body.
    </p>
<p>
     From the parts Rio had paid attention to, the film had actually been an enjoyable watch, though she knew she wouldn't be singing any reviews given that she didn't have enough context to be making any. Who could blame her, anyway? It was her first outing, her first chance to see what it was really like to exist among stars. It wasn't her fault that she hadn't completely absorbed and dissected the entire thing, but she would give it the attention it deserved, just at a later time.
    </p>
<p>
     As the credits began to roll, other occupants inside the room were getting to their feet, but by and large most people stayed planted. It was a show of respect, but for Agatha in that moment, it was so much more.
    </p>
<p>
     "Just wait," Agatha urged, giving Rio's hand a tight squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's gaze stayed trained on the screen, watching as the different names began to appear across the screen over a colorful and textured backdrop.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, there it was.
    </p>
<p>
<b>
      ASSOCIATE PRODUCER
      <br/>
<em>
       AGATHA HARKNESS-VIDAL
      </em>
</b>
</p>
<p>
     In the time it appeared across the center of the large screen, Rio read it over at least eleven times. In those eleven times, she could feel Agatha's grip growing tighter and tighter around her fingers.
    </p>
<p>
     She'd done it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had shouted it to that room full of people, and to anyone else who was going to view that film, who she now was. The interview had been one thing, but this? This was Agatha's way of showing Rio who she had always been as she transformed into who she would be for the rest of her life.
    </p>
<p>
     "That was why he kept sending me things to look over and edit. It was a small contribution, but enough to garner a mention," Agatha informed her softly but still loud enough to be heard over the buzz of the conversations beginning to happen around them.
    </p>
<p>
     The image on the screen was gone physically, but Rio could still see it in her mind. She could still see that declaration to the world that things were different, that even in small ways, Agatha was different. Try as Rio might, keeping the tears out of her eyes was nearly impossible. Keeping them from falling was a little easier, at least until she turned her head to look at her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     "You did this for me?" Rio questioned, though it was clear she already understood the answer.
    </p>
<p>
     "I did it for us. All of us. We're better together, and I like that everyone can know it now too."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio raised a hand to palm Agatha's cheek affectionately, content that it also offered a hold so she could pull Agatha to her, kissing her softly. "I love you more than anything."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's smile wrinkled the corners of her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
     "I love you more than
     <em>
      everything.
     </em>
     Now, you ready for the fun part?"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had not been lying. They had relocated for the after party and for the first little portion of it, Rio had spent a fair amount of time praising Jack while withholding the information that she had not been paying attention the entire time. It was still a feat and as a friend, she was still proud of him.
    </p>
<p>
     After a little while, she had departed for the washroom and as Agatha started to join her, Dave's hand hooked firmly around her bicep. Rio glanced at him just in time to see his deathly serious stare lock into Agatha's as he shook his head in warning.
    </p>
<p>
     With a soft giggle, Rio ventured out and tended to her business before deciding to make her way back to her awaiting wife.
    </p>
<p>
     Only part of the way across the room, Rio heard something to her left that originated from a small gaggle of people all standing in a circle.
    </p>
<p>
     "What do you mean she's married?" one woman asked.
    </p>
<p>
     "No, but really though. Who the fuck in their right mind would marry a stone cold bitch like Agatha Harkness?" Another man's voice sounded and the arrogance there almost made Rio gag.
    </p>
<p>
     She should have kept walking.
    </p>
<p>
     She was already two drinks in, though, and was feeling a bit brave.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio diverted hard to her left and nearly shoved her way in between two bodies, holding a hand out to the man who had just been speaking.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi! I'm Rio!" she introduced, though her facetious demeanor did not slip by anyone in the small crowd.
    </p>
<p>
     "Um, hi?" he returned, the confusion clear on his stupidly chiseled features. "Do I know you?"
    </p>
<p>
     "No! But I heard you summon me, so I thought I should introduce myself!"
    </p>
<p>
     Oh god. The whiskey was a little louder than it should have been.
    </p>
<p>
     "Err... Summon you?" another woman asked, clearly as puzzled as the man.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's bright and devilish green gaze snapped to her, a wide grin showing all possible teeth.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, you asked who would marry Agatha. And... I happened to be close enough to answer the question." She was still grinning, but it somehow grew as the color drained from several faces before her. "It's me," she added, as though she needed to clear any misconceptions. "I married her."
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh -- I -- It's -- We just..." the cliff faced man stammered, but Rio simply giggled.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do you think that maybe she's so cold because people like you do stuff like this so she just wants to batten down more?" She paused, tapping a finger to her lips in thought before continuing. "Being emotionally intelligent is such a rare commodity these days..." As she trailed, Rio stepped away and simply walked off to locate her wife once more.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had barely gotten out a greeting as she slid up to Agatha's side by the time Estee was bounding up, her eyes wide and her smile shoving her cheeks up.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama!" she gushed, latching onto Rio's arm. With one good look at her, it was clear to see that she was more than a little tipsy. "What did you say to them?! They looked like they'd seen a ghost when you walked away!"
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's attention had been pulled by Estee's arrival, but it was most certainly at an all time high when she realized what Estee had said.
    </p>
<p>
     "Say to who?" Agatha questioned, seeking clarification as she looked over Rio's shoulder.
    </p>
<p>
     "There was some people over there," Estee divulged, waving her hand loosely behind her to indicated who she might be speaking about. "They were just talking and mama barged right into their convo and they all looked like they'd just been told the exact day and time they were gonna die." Estee's drunken giggles could only be stifled for so long, finally ripping loose the very moment she stopped speaking.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head turned very, very slowly as she practically bored a hold in Rio's profile, wanting elaboration. Rio simply shrugged her shoulders, looking down into her drink.
    </p>
<p>
     "They asked who would marry you. And... as the person who did, I thought I needed to answer."
    </p>
<p>
     Finally, Rio dared to meet Agatha's gaze, that bright smile finding her lips once more, as if to insist it had been purely innocent.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're something else, my wife," was all Agatha voiced, although the look in her eyes stated that she understood and appreciated it as so much more.
    </p>
<p>
     After finishing another few drinks, Agatha had departed to speak with another producer and Rio had stated that she would find the kids to check on them. She had been well on her way to complete her tipsy task when a voice caught her attention.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a woman's voice, but it held an accent that was quite similar to her own. She recognized it as more southern, though, likely from around the New Plymouth area. Her feet halted their motions and Rio debated for just a moment on what she was going to do. She could have kept going, but there was an instant camaraderie at knowing someone else there grew from the same soil she had.
    </p>
<p>
     Her head turned to locate the source, finding a shorter woman that was likely around the same age Rio was. Her brown hair was notably darker than Agatha's and there was a lot less of it. She was taller than Rio by maybe an inch and those freckles told tales of long afternoons in the hot New Zealand sun.
    </p>
<p>
     Something about her almost felt familiar in other ways, too, but Rio wasn't able to put her finger on it.
    </p>
<p>
     With a deep breath, she pushed forward as the other person the woman had been talking to walked away. The woman herself had lifted her head to search for her companions, but she found Rio first, who held out a nervous hand.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hi, sorry," Rio offered as the woman shook her hand. With just those two words, the woman's expression lit up. "I just heard you talking and you're the first other Kiwi I've come across tonight, so I wanted to say hi. South, right? Based on the accent, I mean?"
    </p>
<p>
     There was a dazzling grin on the other woman's face as she emphatically nodded her head. "I was born and raised in New Plymouth. My family moved us to England for a year, but we went right back. Attended uni in Wellington, but dropped out."
    </p>
<p>
     "Ah, I have a daughter who just graduated. She's thinking about opening a practice here in the city as opposed to back home. I think she really likes it here."
    </p>
<p>
     They went on like that for several minutes, a gentle banter about home life, with Rio making sure to indicate that there was an All Blacks player wandering about the floor. That seemed to excite the other woman as much as it had excited Rio when she had first met Hēmi . After a little longer, the woman's husband made an approach and apologized that he needed to steal her away.
    </p>
<p>
     With a small wave, Rio assured her it had been a delight speaking with her and turned to locate her own tribe, but once more Estee had been watching her like a hawk, waiting to swoop in.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mama! What are you doing?!" she squealed drunkenly as she slid up to Rio's side.
    </p>
<p>
     "I was just chatting. That woman's from New Plymouth. She was very sweet."
    </p>
<p>
     Estee blinked at her.
    </p>
<p>
     "You know who that is."
    </p>
<p>
     That time, it was Rio's turn to blink. Why would she know who that woman was?
    </p>
<p>
     "I do?" Rio asked back, befuddled when she could find no such information within the depths of her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee cleared her throat, trying her hand at a British accent that faired pretty terrible. "'Oh, motha. I'm only here for the food!'"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio simply stared at her, playing it over and over again in her head, but still coming up dry.
    </p>
<p>
     "The nice sister from Ever After! I
     <em>
      know
     </em>
     you've seen that one! We watched it when I was a kid!"
    </p>
<p>
     Oh.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Oh.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Well, this was life now, wasn't it?
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Rio had only seen a handful of films in her life, but she
     <em>
      never
     </em>
     could have expected that she'd be having conversations with the people in them. And yet, there she stood, having talked to someone who's work she had known for quite some time but was a little too out of touch to have ever made the connection.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had inevitably returned moments later and for the rest of the evening, they simply enjoyed in the socializing, the laughter, and the drinks. Midnight had approached and while it had been quite the evening, Rio knew that Agatha could tell her battery was depleting and their large bed sounded like a phenomenal idea.
    </p>
<p>
     She had led Rio around by the hand as they said their goodbyes and approached the children who were lounging easily with several other people their age, drinking and laughing.
    </p>
<p>
     "We are off. Should we tell Gio you bunch are going to stay for a while?" Agatha questioned, eyes dancing over the group to see who was going to answer first.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, maybe have him back at 2?" Nicky spoke up, a drunken grin stuck to his lips.
    </p>
<p>
     "Perfect. We will see you in the morning.
     <em>
      Please
     </em>
     do not puke in the house. And if you do, clean it up."
    </p>
<p>
     "We will!" It sounded four times at once in various voices that were all undeniably intoxicated.
    </p>
<p>
     Bidding them all their love, Rio and Agatha made their way to the awaiting car and an amused Gio who seemed tickled by their stumbling.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do we need food before I deliver you home?" he offered as he held the door open for them.
    </p>
<p>
     "I really want chips and guacamole from Del Taco," Rio informed both of them in a giggle.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes cast up and met Gio's as she offered a nod to indicate that was where she would like him to go. He shut the door behind her and made his way to the driver's seat, setting off on their journey.
    </p>
<p>
     "That was fun," Rio announced decisively. She was quiet for a moment before her eyes lifted to Agatha's profile in the shadows of the car. "I did okay, right?" she asked, though her voice had dropped considerably.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha turned to face her, cradling her jaw in an instant. "You did more than okay, my love. You were incredible."
    </p>
<p>
     To Rio's drunken brain, such a statement was high praise considering who it was coming from. She still felt the need to tack something on.
    </p>
<p>
     "I just wanted to make you proud," she told Agatha in earnest, her eyes soft.
    </p>
<p>
     "Rio," Agatha whispered in admonishment. She leaned forward, placing their lips together in a tender kiss before she pulled back, beholding the woman she loved. "I will always be proud of you."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha paused, her lips twisting up into a small smirk.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Plus, I'm
      <b>
       real
      </b>
      proud of you when you look like that."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oh, is that so?"
     </em>
     Rio mused back, her own mouth hitching up at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It is. Maybe you'll let me show you just how proud when we get home."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     A flicker of a flame whipped across Rio's gaze, her grin turning from delighted to daring.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I'd be disappointed if you didn't."
     </em>

     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The night before, mid-July, when Rio had fallen asleep, she had not given much thought to the following day. She should have. It was a big day, an important day. Well, it was to anyone who wasn't Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     For Rio, it was just another day.
    </p>
<p>
     To everyone else, it was the day, forty years earlier, she happened into existence and began a journey that landed her in the big house in Malibu that she shared with her wife, curled up and warm in their massive bed. It was the day that a light sparked into the universe and illuminated their lives the very moment they came into contact with it.
    </p>
<p>
     It was Rio's 40th birthday.
    </p>
<p>
     With how she had been choosing to not acknowledging it, everyone had been following suit. For some strange reason, it did not strike Rio as suspicious, though it should have. She knew her daughter and she knew that birthdays were important to her. More than that, it was Rio's first birthday with Agatha and as such, it was also her first with an actual family.
    </p>
<p>
     It had probably been a little too foolish to think she would get by with treating it as any other day, wanting to sleep in a little after Agatha went to work. She figured she would drag herself out of bed, making some coffee, and wind up with her legs in the pool on a tame and cool morning while she waited for everyone else to rouse.
    </p>
<p>
     If all else failed, Rio was almost certain that another first, their initial trip to Disneyland as a family -- and consequently, Estee proposing to Tay (and Tay returning the favor, but Rio was the
     <em>
      only
     </em>
     one who knew about that) -- the following day would be enough of a distraction to keep the focus off of her.
    </p>
<p>
     It wasn't that Rio didn't want to be celebrated, it was simply that she thought it was shown enough every other day of the year that she didn't need extra helpings to feel any more valued or treasured.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew what she was to her family. She had every single day since she'd had them as a whole.
    </p>
<p>
     Being woken up to being completely dogpiled by four other people was a nice reminder, though.
    </p>
<p>
     "HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!"
    </p>
<p>
     It was first a harmony and then a chorus as the sentiment got repeated again and again. Despite the crushing weight, Rio was instantaneously aware of every single spot that Agatha's lips pressed to her face, kissing her with delighted fervor on a day of celebration.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You... guys... crushing... me... can't... breathe,"
     </em>
     Rio choked out, trying to wriggle beneath them to no avail.
    </p>
<p>
     The giggles and laughter that filled her ears the moment Agatha's lips pressed to hers made Rio wonder for just a moment if she were still actually alive. There was only one reason she even thought to question it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      This feels like heaven.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     A year ago, Rio had woken up on her houseboat to the smell of fresh bread and homemade jam prepared by her daughter. They had cuddled on the couch and spent the day watching documentaries before going out for a nice meal.
    </p>
<p>
     This year, Rio's day had not even started and she was already being smothered with quadruple the love and affection than her life had ever been capable of providing before.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio had been under the innocently quaint misconception that no plans needed to be made and nothing truly needed to be celebrated, her entire family had been of the complete opposite opinion.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Happy birthday, my beautiful wife,"
     </em>
     Agatha gushed, this time placing a kiss to Rio's lips as everyone else began to ease their weight from her form.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mmmm. Thank you. I am not sure what would have been a better gift, this or sleeping in,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured playfully. Her head picked up so that she could take her own kiss from Agatha, her second in a long line of birthday kisses she would surely garner.
    </p>
<p>
     "Getting up after being loved on, of course!" Estee informed her from her spot near the foot of the bed.
    </p>
<p>
     "And why would I want to do that when I could forget that I'm forty by laying in bed and eating pickles and cheese like a true grown adult?" Rio returned, sinking down a little further into the mattress as her eyes slid shut again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because I got us all tickets to Knott's to celebrate. Then we've already placed the order for Nobu to bring home when we're done!" Nicky announced proudly. The one thing he left out was that Hemi would be meeting them at the amusement park, and he had come bearing gifts.
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't you all have jobs to tend to or like, plans for them or something?" Rio questioned with a giggle as her arms finally raised to wrap snugly around her wife. Agatha had made the choice to not move from her place half atop Rio's body and for that, Rio was thankful.
    </p>
<p>
     "Not today!" Estee and Tay chirped in unison. "Besides, Cole's just waiting for the other therapist's contract to be up and she said the office is as good as mine."
    </p>
<p>
     "And I pretty much make my own schedule," Nicky voiced, as though he needed to remind them.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's head dropped, resting against the front of Rio's shoulder so that she could press her face into her warm neck. "And
     <em>
      I
     </em>
     made sure months ago to tell Dave that nothing got put on the schedule today for this reason."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was laughing before Agatha even stopped speaking, shaking her head against the pillow with her tickled giggles.
    </p>
<p>
     "You are all literally insane," Rio informed them, though she was still holding onto Agatha like she was the best birthday gift Rio could have ever gotten. "It's just another day! It's not a big deal!" She was clearly floundering under all of the focused attention, but the smile on her face clearly communicated that it truly felt wonderful to be woken up by the majority of her loved ones as they ached to celebrate her spending another year upon the earth.
    </p>
<p>
     "It
     <em>
      is
     </em>
     a big deal," Agatha informed her, like arguing such a point was idiotic. "Out of the four people in this room, four of us have one favorite person who was born on this day forty years ago. Majority rules. We win." Agatha picked her head up and sank heavier against Rio's form as she peppered kisses to Rio's face in a sprightly manner.
    </p>
<p>
     "You lot are excessive," Rio managed through the laughter that did not desist because Agatha had not stopped kissing at her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course we are. Look at the two of you," Estee shot before she clapped her hands together in front of her. "Up! Out of bed! There's donuts and coffee downstairs and roller coasters are calling our names!"
    </p>
<p>
     For the few seconds it took for the three children to disperse and for Agatha to slump off of Rio's torso to her side, Rio could feel a smooth and calming wave of love and appreciation wash over her.
    </p>
<p>
     For forty years, even in spite of Estee's rambunctious desire to celebrate, her birthday had just been another day for Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     This year, it felt like a little more.
    </p>
<p>
     It felt like the first birthday of an entirely new life.
    </p>
<p>
     That, she thought, was a little more worthy of celebration.
    </p>
<p>
     With as much gusto as she could muster, and with the help of her too-sweet wife and the fuel of her encouraging kisses, Rio peeled herself out of bed and prepared for the day. They took a quick shower, giggled their way through brushing their teeth, and held soft and praising conversation -- coming from Agatha's end, obviously -- while they put on light makeup and dressed for their day of fun.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was coming to realize something very dangerous; the way Agatha kept talking to her, her voice such a smooth hum of adoration, and telling her that she was the most beautiful, that she was a blessing they got for another year, that age only looked better on her, she was going to need a change of underwear by noon.
    </p>
<p>
     No, she argued back against that pathetic little voice, she was a grown woman and could handle herself for a morning and afternoon out with her family.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe.
    </p>
<p>
     Probably.
    </p>
<p>
     Hopefully.
    </p>
<p>
     Putting it to the test was the only way to find out and so, once dressed, the five of them convened by the front door before departing. Gio greeted them in the early morning sun with a bright grin on his handsome face as he gifted Rio a
     <em>
      Happy Birthday, ma'am
     </em>
     when he held the door for her.
    </p>
<p>
     In their totality, they were buzzing. It was a weekday late morning and they were going to spend their entire day just having
     <em>
      fun.
     </em>
     It was a time to be together, to laugh and make more memories to add to the infinite list. When they pulled into the lot and climbed out, Rio's eye caught a dark haired man leaning against a very shiny Escalade. The daring grin he wore was a direct contrast to the dark shades on his face as he pushed off the car.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hemi!" Rio greeted, nearly stumbling over herself to get to him. "I didn't know you were here! No one tells me anything!" Her embrace was strong as she held him close, thanking him softly before she released him with a bright smile on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     She just felt so loved.
    </p>
<p>
     And that was before Hemi opened the back hatch of the vehicle and reached inside, pulling out something black and covered in several spots with illegible white markings. He picked the top item off and handed it to Rio with his eyes wrinkled at the corners from his grin.
    </p>
<p>
     "Happy birthday, mama," he told her softly.
    </p>
<p>
     She took the item from him, opening it up more to truly get a good look at it. She was staring at the front side of an All Blacks kit; she was torn between giggling and crying.
    </p>
<p>
     "Turn it around," he urged.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's shimmering gaze flickered to him in question for a fleeting moment, her brow pinching slightly at the beaming he was still doing. She did as she was told, though, turning the kit around in her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     There, above her lucky number 23, were bright white letters stitched into the black fabric.
    </p>
<p>
     HARKNESS-VIDAL
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't want to cry. She didn't want to spend her entire day as a sap who couldn't wrangle the emotions caused by being loved so wholly and treasured so infinitely. Right then, she wasn't sure if she'd survive the day if she tried to hold it all in. Her eyes were already stinging, pricking threateningly with tears indicative of how overwhelmed she was feeling.
    </p>
<p>
     "You had this made for me?" she questioned, looking over the shoulder hem to meet his gaze.
    </p>
<p>
     "I had them made for all of us," Hemi returned, lips hitching at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
     Everyone else had materialized behind her, completely outside of her awareness, and was reaching in for their own jerseys, jovial and excited as they held them up. The way everyone showed off their numbers; Nicky's was 13, Estee's was 7, Tay's was 25 and Hemi's was the same as it was for him typically at his big number 8. Agatha was grinning as she looked at hers, all eyes turning toward her expectantly. Well, except for Hemi. He already knew her mischief.
    </p>
<p>
     "Something funny, my love?" Rio inquired, quirking a brow at her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's chin lifted high as she decided to share with everyone else what had tickled her so much.
    </p>
<p>
     Below her HARKNESS-VIDAL was the most Agatha thing that ever could have been there.
    </p>
<p>
     The number 69.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's head snapped to Hemi, her eyes narrowing at him in playful ire. "You should not be enabling her tomfoolery!" Rio goaded, pursing her lips for just a moment before her gaze shifted back to that insane woman she loved so dearly. "And you, my love, are positively rotten."
    </p>
<p>
     "You would love me no other way!" came Agatha's boasting as she folded the item back up in her hands. "I would say we should wear them, but it's going to be hot and sunny and these are black so... Maybe we will organize a family event --"
    </p>
<p>
     "Like maybe the playoffs that I have the box reserved for. But that day I have to wear my real kit," he informed sadly, as if he had not just led with the fact that they would be attending an All Blacks game together as a family to support him and cheer him on.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, like that," Agatha added, still radiating in her state of watching things come together just the way she had planned.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio took just a moment to survey the most beautiful, caring, sweet faces she had known in her life as they gathered around her on a day that meant so very much to each of them for their own reasons.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee, her true ride or die, the one person who had been there for every up and down over the last twenty two years.
    </p>
<p>
     Tay, her second daughter, someone she loved with her whole heart in the most maternal fashion imaginable.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky, her newfound son, a young man that had come to be a point of pride for her as well as his own mother.
    </p>
<p>
     Hemi, an unexpected addition that showed her the admiration she showed him with such ease.
    </p>
<p>
     And her wife, her Agatha.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha, the woman who had fallen into her life and made certain that not a single thing stayed the same. Agatha, the woman who had reached into the deepest, most hidden parts of Rio's soul and pulled out the human being she always could have been if life had not been so impossibly cruel to her in her younger years. Agatha, the woman who had loved her without question from the very moment they met.
    </p>
<p>
     The emotion was there, refracting the light of the sun in its awestricken glaze, but Rio choked it down, forcing a genuine but tight smile as she tried to corral the chaos in her head long enough to speak.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm not going to deliver a speech or anything, but... Thank you. All of you. I have had a birthday like this... practically never, so...
     <em>
      thank you.
     </em>
     "
    </p>
<p>
     Like a swarm, the five of them closed in on her, a tangle of arms and hugs and a blossoming of bodies around her, the center, the foundation of their very family.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio would have insisted that such a title would belong to Agatha, but really?
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was the cement that held them in place and she had come to realize it more with time. Right then, with her whole world surrounding her, it had never been more obvious.
    </p>
<p>
     Their day had somehow both drawn on for hours on end and yet, it had come to a close too soon all the same.
    </p>
<p>
     They had spent hours on roller coasters and various rides, shared in treats and drinks -- the kids were drunk by 2pm -- and there had been so much laughter that Rio could genuinely not recall such a time that had held
     <em>
      so much
     </em>
     pure happiness. It was a happiness that was a product of a full life, a beautiful life, a life that Rio had dreamed about so very many years ago.
    </p>
<p>
     It had been a fantasy and now, it had become her reality.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they were filing out and loading into the vehicle Hemi had rented for his stay, a sober Agatha behind the wheel, it had already felt as though the day had been perfect and could not get any better. Of course, Rio knew that was a farce; they had all informed her that her gifts were waiting at home and that they had an additional stop to make at the bakery she had grown to love -- not too far from where they were picking up dinner -- for her cake.
    </p>
<p>
     When Rio had fallen asleep the night before, she had been under the impression that her birthday would be as it had been the many years before it, and she was at peace with a simple and lowkey expression of her own vitality. However, as she sat in the passengers' seat with her hand wrapped snugly in her wife's, she realized that what she had right then was better than gold, better than any treasure.
    </p>
<p>
     The love they had for her was the best gift she could have ever been given.
    </p>
<p>
     That was even before they took her out back before they sat down for their meal to show the four thousand dollar telescope that they kids had assembled that morning before they left for the amusement park.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew, without even asking, that it was one-hundred-percent Agatha's doing. That conversation, the one where they hadn't been able to look at one another but had held hands while having it, flashed through her mind. She could see the pink and purple LA sky outside of the Morongo. She could almost
     <em>
      smell
     </em>
     how clean the air had been that night. And Agatha had made her that promise to buy her that stupid and ridiculously expensive telescope.
    </p>
<p>
     Okay, it wasn't stupid. It was actually tooth-rottingly sweet.
    </p>
<p>
     It was still ridiculously expensive.
    </p>
<p>
     Once more, a tide of utter love and devotion washed over her, the five of them sailing cleanly in with it. That time, in the privacy of their own backyard, Rio did cry. It wasn't a heavy cry, but the tears streamed as she told them all again and again how thankful she was, how appreciative she was, and how much she loved them right back.
    </p>
<p>
     They had all ventured off separately to change out of their day clothes, ones that had been dampened by tube rides and sweat, and into something a little more formal but still quite casual for their meal. It was nice blouses and sharp denim, button ups and crisp pressed shorts. They were staying in, perhaps, but looking nice still
     <em>
      felt
     </em>
     nice.
    </p>
<p>
     Aside from that, Rio had her own devious reasons for wanting to change in the form of the bra and underwear she had purchased for that very day. Truthfully, those articles could not at all be considered the items they were named; the 'bra' was corded straps with a thin sheet of lace that came down only far enough to cover her nipples. The 'underwear' was a complete piece of lace over the hindquarters only, with two very small triangles of it around the front, leaving the crotch area entirely open and exposed.
    </p>
<p>
     Staying in meant fun and if Rio knew Agatha, she'd already come up with a plan to get the kids out of the house the rest of the evening or, at the very least, had found somewhere for the two of them to go. With the occasion, Rio was leaning more toward the former.
    </p>
<p>
     They
     <em>
      could
     </em>
     have had their meal in a public setting and shared in endless drinks and boisterous laughter that would have likely bordered on bothersome for other occupants, but there was something so much more grounding and intimate about the way the children moved around to organize the table with tea lights and wine glasses. The little banners and streamers they had hung up that morning before their trip were still loud and bright from their positions, shouting their congratulations to Rio on thriving another year.
    </p>
<p>
     When she went to take her spot at the end of the table on the right side of Agatha's place at the head of it, her wife charismatically clucked her tongue, giving her head a gentle shake as she pulled out the chair she always occupied -- the throne, as it were.
    </p>
<p>
     "You sit here tonight," Agatha instructed, hands grasping either side of the chair as she stood poised behind it. Her expression was
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     neutral, but there was the tiniest little spark shooting across her eyes, something that almost dared Rio to challenge her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha," Rio chastised, brow pinching. Like clockwork, she pulled her own chair out and offered another admonishment. "Stop that."
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm serious," Agatha returned, her voice solid in its delivery. "Its your birthday. And the first I get to spend with you...
     <em>
      We
     </em>
     get to all spend with you. The day has been about you, and will continue to be. So tonight, you sit at the head of the table."
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, all Rio could feel was numbness, but only in a way that came from being so thoroughly stunned by such a delivered sentiment. It was minute, in the grand scheme of things, but Rio saw it for the affectionate gesture Agatha was intending it to be. Agatha was the head of their worlds, the captain of their ship and rightfully so. She took that head seat because she had earned it in her steadfastness and consistency.
    </p>
<p>
     That was not what the throne was right then. It was a pedestal, a way for Rio's adoring family to see her the clearest when they all turned to look at her. It was a way for her to be their focal point, to be their cause for celebration.
    </p>
<p>
     On that day, she was the reason, and embracing that fact was okay.
    </p>
<p>
     For a moment, Rio's lips twisted in her silent debate before she stepped away from the chair, leaving it out so that Agatha could fill it once this small war was over. Although she moved toward that awaiting seat, Rio shifted to behind it instead, raising a palm to cradle her wife's jaw as she surveyed her, mystified.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're being sickeningly sweet over something silly like a birthday," Rio remarked, her gaze darting from blue eye to blue eye to soft pink lips and back up again. On second thought, she glanced over her shoulder at the children who had all taken their respective places. "All of you, actually." She turned back toward Agatha and leaned in, pressing their lips softly together in an thankful kiss that did not last long.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's gaze shifted over Rio's shoulder, landing on Estee. "So, next year, gotta work on the whole 'We're allowed to pay her excessive attention on this
     <em>
      one
     </em>
     day of the year' thing, hm?"
    </p>
<p>
     Before Agatha could taper the sentence, Rio was already both grinning and rolling her eyes. A hand lifted, gentle fingers poking critically between ribs.
    </p>
<p>
     "It's an adjustment. I should get I five year period or something," Rio whined softly, a faux pout tugging on her bottom lip. She might have thought to offer more excuses, but any qualm was silenced the moment Agatha shot forward and kissed her.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, well, we start tonight. Sit so you can have your rosemary crusted lamb that reminds you of home." It was so authoritative as it left Agatha's lips, but only in a way that allowed her to communicate that she was not budging on such a stance. This was Rio Day, full send, and there would be no further discussion.
    </p>
<p>
     One last stolen kiss was garnered by the birthday girl before she placed herself in the chair, allowing for Agatha to push it in appropriately. It was silly, but the view was different. To her left sat Nicky, then Hemi, both grinning like fools. To her right, her queen, followed by Estee and Tay, beaming in their reverence.
    </p>
<p>
     Dinner had been, as Rio had known it would be, absolutely delicious. They'd yet to be disappointed in the choice of restaurant and that night had been no exception; despite the celebration aspect, everyone was a little less chatty than usual, surely due to the quality of the meal. It didn't dilute the mood in any way; they were still talking, but appreciating at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     As they were wrapping up, Agatha wiped at the corner of her mouth with her cloth napkin and set it on her lap as her eyes cast over the four children around them. "I have booked you all the penthouse at the Ritz in Marina Del-Rey for the evening. The bar will be stocked, any room service is on me."
    </p>
<p>
     The very first person Rio looked at was Nicky. She realized instantly that he was the first person
     <em>
      everyone
     </em>
     looked at, as if expecting some kind of quip or immature prattling about the implications of such a reservation.
    </p>
<p>
     As though there were not four pairs of eyes and a very dopey boyfriend next to him, Nicky simply picked up his wine glass and took a sip casually. In lowering his glass, those green eyes flickered up and made brief stops along every other pair looking at him before landing on his sister. "Free food, alcohol, and a balcony view of the ocean? You're not getting a peep out of me."
    </p>
<p>
     To punctuate himself, he finished the rest of his wine.
    </p>
<p>
     That glass hitting the table was the permission everyone else needed to fall prey to laughter; for once in his life, Nicky had made the very wise decision to not be a complete smart-ass. It was quite hilarious.
    </p>
<p>
     "And yes," Agatha voiced, glancing to Estee at her side, "there are sleeping quarters on opposite ends of the penthouse."
    </p>
<p>
     This seemed to satisfy all parties, though Nicky
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     have something to say after all.
    </p>
<p>
     "So... Do you think maybe you can start doing this every weekend? I wouldn't be made sharing space at the Ritz..."
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's eyes rolled automatically, as though she'd just been waiting for him to stop talking long enough to accomplish the overt display of how unamused she was.
    </p>
<p>
     "You make money like a big boy, feel free," she offered, a facetious grin springing across her face as she lifted her own wine to polish it off.
    </p>
<p>
     "It was worth a try," he said with a shrug.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee's sudden laughter shocked everyone at the table, their focuses all sweeping straight to her in question.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'm really proud of you, bubba," she voiced, though the tone she chose was quite smug. "That's the very first time you didn't get all eleven-year-old boy about sex."
    </p>
<p>
     "Ack!" he spat back in return. "You didn't have to call it out!"
    </p>
<p>
     That time,
     <em>
      everyone
     </em>
     laughed.
    </p>
<p>
     It had taken a total of about twenty minutes for the remnants of dinner to be disposed of and for the children to whisk away to their respective spaces to quickly pack bags for an overnight stay. Agatha had taken that time to refill their glasses with the last bits of wine that had been left, though divided between the two of them it wasn't much.
    </p>
<p>
     When the children reconvened in the living room after offering departing hugs to their parents, they were all shouldering their own lightly packed duffle bags and sporting grins brighter than the sun. They looked like they were the real winners here, but both Agatha and Rio knew that to be a farce.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright!" Agatha declared, setting her wine glass down. "Ground rules: Don't get kicked out. That's literally it. And for the love of Gods, please don't run around naked anywhere. I don't care how drunk you are. Dave's overworked as it is." There was a tinge of seriousness to her words, but the smirk Agatha was wearing as she surveyed their small gaggle was a true display of her amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     "Behave. Don't be naked in public. Don't be an embarrassment to the family name. So hard drugs are still on the table?" Estee listed, throwing up a finger for each thing she rattled off with that completely delighted and devious expression she was wearing.
    </p>
<p>
     "I have decided to not dignify that with an answer, on my
     <em>
      birthday
     </em>
     of all days," Rio returned, though she was wearing a too-large grin that wrinkled her eyes at the corners.
    </p>
<p>
     Surprisingly, Hemi was the one to offer gratitude aloud.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, Agatha. You didn't do it for us, but it's still kind of you," he voiced, shouldering his bag a little more as he headed toward the front door, poking his boyfriend in the side while muttering a
     <em>
      Thank your mother
     </em>
     at him with a light laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you, mom. You could have thrown us in a Motel 6 and I'm sure we'd have had as much fun, but -- "
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, so I can call and cancel the reservation?" she offered, though the other three were quick to speak over him.
    </p>
<p>
     "No!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Nicholas!"
    </p>
<p>
     "He means 'Thanks mum! You're the best! We definitely won't be on TMZ tomorrow morning!'" Estee called over her shoulder at the edge of the foyer.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, that! What she said!" he shouted, not turning to cast his voice as his sister had.
    </p>
<p>
     The front door opened, but all four of them stopped, huddled for just a moment. Rio saw Tay's hand bob in the air -- she was silently counting to three -- before each of their voices sounded in unison.
    </p>
<p>
     "HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MAMA!"
    </p>
<p>
     "Thank you my little loves!" she returned brightly, her grin somehow staving the immediate tidal wave of emotion that struck her at such a beautiful sound of love and appreciation.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee was the last one out, stalling as she went to pull the door shut. Her eyes found them still at the table, a very kind and very adoring smile on her face. "Thank you. And have fun!" she told him before turning to head out. The door clicked shut, about ten seconds passed, and it popped open again.
    </p>
<p>
     "Agatha! Check your texts!" The sounds of Estee's laughter became muted as she shut the door again, this time for good.
    </p>
<p>
     Slicing to her wife, Rio's eyebrows lifted with the expectation that Agatha do as she was told. Accordingly, Agatha produced her phone from her shorts pocket and unlocked it, immediately bursting into laughter at whatever had appeared on the screen.
    </p>
<p>
     "Do share," Rio encouraged, trying to stifle her own amusement.
    </p>
<p>
     "It says, 'Really, do have fun but please remember we have Disneyland' with a ring emoji after 'in two days and she HAS to be able to walk. Just a friendly reminder! We love you both!' And three sobbing face emojis as well as three green hearts." Although she did successfully manage to read the entirety of the message without succumbing to tears of humor, it was clear that Agatha's face had to be aching with just how hard she was smiling.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio leaned forward, her hand sliding to hook over Agatha's firmly, giving it a tight squeeze. "They are everything," she said softly. It was a tender delivery of a very sincere sentiment, something Rio could say she felt to be true in every inch of her body. They had incredible kids, and if the worst that happened was they got heckled over the fact that they were sexual human beings by one of the four? It was a small price to pay for every other incredible attribute they had to brandish toward the world.
    </p>
<p>
     "They are something," Agatha tossed back, her chest beginning to shake with a laugh that did not quite make a sound.
    </p>
<p>
     A brief pause settled between them, Rio's adoring gaze fixed on her wife as her thumb mindlessly brushed at the backs of her knuckles. And then, she realized, it was
     <em>
      time.
     </em>
     Her shoulders wiggled side to side for a few shimmies before she slipped right into deviant mode, hiding it under layers of coyness.
    </p>
<p>
     "What do you say we open another bottle of wine and watch a film?" she proposed, ensuring that she kept her voice even, maybe even bordering on innocent.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's blue eyes darkened for a moment, a ripple of confusion passing through them. Rio had known it was coming, had even anticipated it, but she did not waver for even a beat. Her face remained smooth, her eyes steady as they bored straight into Agatha's.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah," she managed, lips pursing
     <em>
      almost
     </em>
     imperceptibly before her free palm smoothed over the surface of the table. "Of course!"
    </p>
<p>
     It was fashioned, tailored to sound nonplussed, but Rio knew Agatha better than that.
    </p>
<p>
     "I've got it!" Rio chirped, letting Agatha's hand go to grab their glasses before she got to her feet to head to the kitchen. In the time that it had taken her to gather up a new bottle and grab the corkscrew, Agatha had met her in the kitchen, stepping up behind her as her hands found Rio's hips.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew Agatha's lips were going to find her skin, she just hadn't expected them to be on the back of her neck, moving toward the side as Agatha stepped into her. She gently pinned the front of Rio's hips with her own to the lip of the counter.
    </p>
<p>
     "And what film are you wanting to watch this evening?" Agatha questioned in a smooth purr. She placed more very firm and very deliberate kisses up the side of Rio's neck to her ear.
    </p>
<p>
     "Mmm, figured we could settle on one together," Rio offered back, her head tipping to the side to expose more of her flesh to Agatha's attention and lips.  Agatha was eager to feast, kissing along that crook down to her shoulder, humming warmly against her skin.
    </p>
<p>
     "Is that so?" Agatha asked, teeth skimming over her shoulder, giving her hips a squeeze before applying more pressure to them as she leaned in closer.
    </p>
<p>
     "It is," Rio returned, still trying to focus on the act of uncorking the wine. As Agatha's hands moved, though, that task was becoming a lot harder. They were trekking forward, around Rio's front in a way that caused her stomach to twist in anticipation. She shouldn't have, but she placed the heels of her hands on the counter and pressed back as much as she could, a show of wills, though she wasn't exactly trying to get Agatha any further away.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, the shift created enough of a gap that Agatha's left hand slipped into the waist of Rio's shorts with ease.
    </p>
<p>
     Alright, it was
     <em>
      go time.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The moment Agatha's fingers skated over the soft lace and then met nothing but bare skin and coarse hair, she completely froze and audibly drew in a breath so sharp it could have sliced through solid steep.
    </p>
<p>
     For the briefest moment, Rio could have sworn she heard Agatha grinding her teeth.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Rio Daniela,"
     </em>
     Agatha hissed from behind her, breath nearly scorching as it hit Rio's neck.
     <em>
      "What are you wearing?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     She tried to contain it, but a giggle flittered from between Rio's lips. She leaned into her wife, her eyes slipping shut as Agatha's touch began to move slightly, as if trying to prove to herself that her senses were not betraying her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Happy birthday to me?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     When Agatha actually took half a step back but did not immediately remove her hand, Rio's brow pinched, small lines forming above her nose to indicate her confusion. She almost asked if everything was already, but in a voracious growl, Agatha spoke behind her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Upstairs. Fuck the wine."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio had a window. She had a small opening where she could flex a slightly more defiant side of herself that she did not often tap into. So she took it.
    </p>
<p>
     "I don't know, I think it could be kind of -- Hey! Agatha!"
    </p>
<p>
     It happened so fast that Rio could hardly make sense of it. Agatha's hand whipped out of her shorts but did not go far as it immediately matched position with the other as they landed on her hips, pulling her back with mild force. And then, with deeply rooted intention, Agatha spun her around and -- in a move that gave Rio vivid flashbacks of the Auckland airport parking garage -- leaned over to place a shoulder into Rio's middle.
    </p>
<p>
     A soft grunt escaped Agatha, but she managed to lift a squealing and laughing Rio off her feet, marching straight toward the stairs, her arm cinched tightly around Rio's waist to hold her in place.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio didn't fight it. There was no point. It was what she had wanted anyway, she had just thought that she might be able to have a little bit of fun first. She had expected the children to have been gone at least
     <em>
      ten
     </em>
     minutes instead of just four, but she wasn't going to complain.
    </p>
<p>
     Who could possibly, in their right mind, complain that their forever beautiful wife was hauling them up the stairs to likely fuck them senseless?
    </p>
<p>
     Not Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Not ever.
    </p>
<p>
     Not even when she wasn't in her right mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead, she just giggled and gave Agatha's ass cheek a few pokes for good measure, though she did not realize just how much she was stoking the fire.
    </p>
<p>
     All Agatha did in response to each prodding was huff. When she finally reached the bedroom, she bent again, dropping Rio onto the bed. As she stood, Rio realized for the first time just how red her face had become the more flustered she'd become. A remark could have been made, something sly and taunting, but Agatha was faster.
    </p>
<p>
     "Stripped and comfortable. I will only be a minute." Agatha was trying so hard to be demanding, to order Rio around, but Rio could see that ravenous hunger as it whipped around blue irises wildly.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes ma'am," Rio offered back, attempting to be solid as she gave a mock salute, but she was smiling and fighting laughter within seconds.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's jaw clenched and her nose wrinkled slightly, but she offered nothing further as she turned on her heel and marched into the closet, disappearing to her side.
    </p>
<p>
     For a few seconds, Rio just sat there grinning. She knew that the night had just started, but that look in Agatha's eyes had definitely kicked her right between the legs. Whatever she was planning, Rio knew she could only benefit from it. Whatever it was that Agatha had cooked up in that head of hers, it was only ever going to be a plan to love, to please, to ravish. That was all Agatha would ever give her, per her own promise.
    </p>
<p>
     The moments of appreciation passed and Rio moved into action, doing as she had been told by means of taking her top and shorts off, leaving them to land on the floor beside the bed, forgotten and unimportant. She had scooted back, propping herself against the pillows as the mischief began to swirl in her mind.
    </p>
<p>
     Her attention was on the closet doorway, but Agatha had yet to appear. Rio could hear soft grunts coming from inside every few seconds, and the effect it was having on her was not one she would have initially expected, but it made sense.
    </p>
<p>
     That throbbing between her legs intensified with each sound.
    </p>
<p>
     It was starting to drive her insane.
    </p>
<p>
     So, she did something about it.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hips wiggled slightly and she leaned into the pillows a little more, bending both legs at the knees and parting them. A previously idle hand landed on her stomach, then voyaged lower until fingertips met slick and soaked warmth, the quietest worked-up sigh escaping her. She explored her own body, just caressing, touching, feeling the result of what being with Agatha did to her when the temperature rose and the lust began to bubble.
    </p>
<p>
     As green eyes slid shut, Rio wet her lips with a swipe of her tongue as her head tipped back minutely, the tiny bit of relief from her own touch very visibly having an effect on her.
    </p>
<p>
     And then she heard it.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oh. What the fuck."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Agatha had gotten her very first view of Rio in that 'bra' and those crotchless lace panties and it was with her legs spread and hand between them, working herself over while she wanted. Rio could
     <em>
      hear
     </em>
     in her voice that she was fighting to maintain consciousness.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's chin snapped down as her eyes flew open. There was no
     <em>
      possible
     </em>
     way that she could have guessed what Agatha had been up to in that closet.
    </p>
<p>
     Looking like she was on the verge of losing the battle to keep her knees from knocking, Agatha stood there in something Rio had never seen before, something she never could have even
     <em>
      imagined
     </em>
     even in her wilder moments.
    </p>
<p>
     Straps. There were a lot of lavender colored straps. There were ones that hooked over her shoulders beneath the bra of the same color, as well as one that stretched across her ribs. Separately, there was another gathering of those straps beneath her ribs. The hooked around her waist, meeting at a circular ring in the middle. The way it sat, her navel was visible in the very center of the ring. The slivers of fabric ran lower and met parallel ones that were enclosed around her legs. Over all of that, there was a bottom that matched the bra piece, but it had two small white clasps that could be pressured to release the bottoms.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio felt like her heart had dropped into her pussy and both heartbeats were thundering away in a manner that was going to send her straight into an unconscious state.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      Holy fuck.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     They were both stuck, buffering with that rainbow wheel of doom spinning in their brains as they simply ogled one another, drinking in the delicious and carnal beauty of what their infernal love looked like when they decided to venture into different territories.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha broke free first. A soft
     <em>
      fuck
     </em>
     left her as she turned around and darted in the closet, but was gone considerably less time before she reemerged, a leather harness with a not unfamiliar black and purple swirled 7 inch dildo attached dangling from her fingers. Also, the bra and clipped panties had mysteriously disappear, stopping Rio's heart even further.
    </p>
<p>
     It could have been sentimental, the way Agatha had clearly been driven insane by the sight of her wife open and waiting on that bed, but the heat was up way too high for such tenderness.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I cannot fucking believe you,"
     </em>
     Agatha growled lowly as she stalked toward the bed. With an unmatched effortlessness, she tossed the harness onto the bed and sunk onto the mattress on her knees and then dropped to her hands.
    </p>
<p>
     She looked the absolute picture of a predator as she slunk forward, slowly and deliberately, her eyes practically fucking Rio well enough on their own before their skin had even touched.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Stop that,"
     </em>
     Agatha commanded, her gaze flickering down to Rio's hand as her fingers had continued to glide and work over needy flesh. Rio didn't want to. She didn't want there to be
     <em>
      nothing
     </em>
     there if she took her hand away, not with Agatha looking like
     <em>
      that.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I don't want to,"
     </em>
     Rio whined in return, tongue attempting to wet her lips again, though it had grown bone dry at the sight before her.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment she was close enough, Agatha took hold of Rio's wrist and pulled it back, moving it to the side before she let it rest against the sheet below them. Her eyes dropped, that burning and wanting gaze landing on that perfectly framed pussy in all its glory, Rio's arousal glistening in the dim corner light of the room.
    </p>
<p>
     Judging by the expression Agatha was wearing, it looked like a seven course meal. Then, those dangerously desperate blue irises raised and locked right into Rio's, burning so hot they could have been white and it would not have been a shock. Prowling further, Agatha positioned herself over Rio, nudging her back a little further.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio obliged, sliding a little further down the mattress as Agatha dropped her head so that their lips could brush. The surprising thing about the contact was that for as absolutely feral as Agatha looked, the kiss was gentle. It wasn't hurried or rushed or frenzied in the sense that Agatha felt like she was absolutely going to wreck her from top to bottom. It was loving, sweet even.
    </p>
<p>
     It deepened for a few moments as lips parted, but tongues remained contained until Agatha pulled away.
    </p>
<p>
     Her hand lifted and landed delicately on Rio's face as their eyes opened and locked. What Rio saw there was emotional and raw, it was honest even before Agatha spoke a word.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "This might be your first birthday we get together,"
     </em>
     she began, ducking to take another light kiss.
     <em>
      "But I cannot tell you the utter bliss it brings me to know that I get so many more with you. And we'll make each one just as memorable as the last."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was the one to initiate the locking of their lips that time, leaning up just enough to take the gift she wanted, the physical show of how much she loved Agatha, and how much Agatha loved her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you,"
     </em>
     Rio whispered, sealing the statement with one more kiss, just because.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you, too,"
     </em>
     Agatha returned. The kiss she offered that time was a little warmer, a little longer but she still ended it before hands began to move and they careened too out of control. She did not go far, though, her face still hovering above Rio's, that utter reverence written so plainly over every inch of her expression.
     <em>
      "Happy birthday, my love."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     And then, just like that, the starting gates dropped and they were off.
    </p>
<p>
     Assertive could have been a word choice to explain the way Agatha crushed their mouths together. Deprived, maybe. More than either of those, that kiss Agatha imparted on her was downright necessitous and greedy, but Rio didn't care. She could take anything and everything she wanted and Rio would give it to her. That was what suited them best; they were always ready to give when the other wanted to take and were more than willing to take when the other was so desperate to give.
    </p>
<p>
     It took little time for Agatha's hand to slide into Rio's hair, tongue making its debut as it pressed past her lips, tasting of more wine than Rio's own seemed to in her own mouth. It was delicious, it was even better than the actual taste of the wine itself. It was more robust, somehow more satiating.
    </p>
<p>
     The pressure in Agatha's arm that had been keeping her elevated above Rio released and she gingerly lowered herself down, her weight pressing Rio's frame further into the mattress as the kiss escalated. Agatha was relentless in her exploration, scoping every inch of Rio's mouth she could get to with her tongue, an attention paid that was doing dangerous things to the chemical levels in Rio's brain.
    </p>
<p>
     Starting to feel like she couldn't breathe, Rio's head dipped back a bit into the pillows to sever the contact and Agatha caught on, removing first her tongue and then her lips for them to gasp in oxygen in equal measure. It lasted a little longer for Rio, as evidenced by the fact that Agatha's mouth was immediately busy again, placing hungry kisses to Rio's neck.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe under any other circumstance, Agatha might have shown some restraint, but it was clear that this was an exception. She made it known in the way she sucked and nipped and kissed and licked. There was an untamed desperation there, something that was pouring out of her with every move she made, including the way her hands had moved, sliding down Rio's sides. One arm wedged beneath her, wrapping firmly before Agatha rolled them, flipping over onto her back so that Rio was on top of her.
    </p>
<p>
     Her lips had hardly lifted from that scape of skin on Rio's neck, even in the movement, until she chose to sever the contact. Her head dropped to the pillow and that vibrant gaze was locked in on the object of its desire; Rio.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Gift one,"
     </em>
     Agatha started, a wickedly devious smirk twisting at her lips. She raised a hand, tapping on her chin.
     <em>
      "Dining room table isn't the only throne you deserve to sit on."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio felt like she had been dropped from quite a height and had plummeted right into an awaiting pit of nothing but scorching hot lava. She was not sure if Agatha had at all mapped this out in her head, but if she had to guess, Rio's sneaky addition to the mix had certainly mixed things up.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Is that so?"
     </em>
     Rio questioned, sultry in such an inquiry.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It is,"
     </em>
     Agatha answered easily, lifting her head to catch Rio's bottom lip between her teeth. She gave it a light tug before a release shortly after.
     <em>
      "I want to see you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio's legs had already started moving, raising so that her knees could plant firmly on either side of Agatha's waist. Before she lifted her torso, there was a need for one last meeting of their mouths, a light swipe of tongue across Agatha's teeth in a taunt, and a barely whispered moan dumped past her lips.
    </p>
<p>
     Once accomplished, she raised and shifted, Agatha's accommodation and adjustments as she slid further down the bed happening concurrently.
    </p>
<p>
     With a fluid and easy sense of grace, Rio positioned herself above her grinning wife, eager for her dessert. Who needed the forgotten about cake when
     <em>
      that
     </em>
     was right in front of her? Agatha's hands lifted and landed on the silk covering that sheeted Rio's backside, needy fingers sinking in roughly as Agatha pulled her down, beckoning her closer.
    </p>
<p>
     It was soft kisses, at first, despite that burning rage Rio could see in Agatha's face. They were attentive, hitting those erogenous spots on the inside of her thighs, so very measured in their placement. Then, they trekked upward, dotting along the crease where her thigh met her core. Agatha's hands slid, dropping lower so that her thumbs could hook beneath Rio, spreading her open a little more to grant herself easier access.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, there it was.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's mouth on her body
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     felt divine, but there was something insanely hot about the fact that they were both clad in those ridiculously hot lingerie sets while celebrating a previously unimportant day to Rio in the most carnal fashion.
    </p>
<p>
     A hand shot down and landed in Agatha's hair, gripping out of nothing but pure instinct. The pleasure impelled it, caused it to happen, but it still somehow felt natural. Simultaneously, her other hand found her own chest, squeezing a breast in some form of relief. She tried to show restraint, but Rio was slipping quickly and it showed in the way her hips twitched, wanting so badly to roll down into the feeling of Agatha's tongue as it explored the most intimate part of her.
    </p>
<p>
     It was also the part of her Agatha coveted most when lights were low and clothes were off. She sent that message at full volume with the attention she was devoting to it right then.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel each spot that the tip of Agatha's tongue skimmed and touched and devoured and had finally succumbed to needing some form of control. Her hips rolled down, pulling a moan from Agatha that Rio could feel vibrate all the way in her very middle, causing it to twist in need. Agatha's grip sank in deeper, the pressure painful in the most scrumptious way.
    </p>
<p>
     With her head tipped back, she began to true purpose of her placing herself where she was, truly working her hips to garner every bit of ecstasy she could as Agatha seemed to want nothing more than to swallow her whole. It was pleasure, it was bliss, and the moans that had started to spill out of her the longer she worked were surely indicative that everything Agatha was doing was working exactly how she wanted it to.
    </p>
<p>
     In her haze, there was something Rio had not done that was typically common place for her: she hadn't actually
     <em>
      looked
     </em>
     at Agatha. To remedy that, her chin dropped and those lust filled green eyes took in the sight of her wife who looked like she was in absolute heaven. Those blues had darkened in her esurience and she was clearly devouring the sight of Rio there above her, that thin layer of lace so loose that Agatha could surely see her nipples beneath it from such a vantage point.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was well aware that Agatha loved her body, but that look in her eyes in those moments said very loudly that there would never be an instance where she could get enough.
    </p>
<p>
     There had been a complacency, for just a moment, as they fell into a steady rhythm of Rio's hips rocking and Agatha's tongue working in tandem with her lips. It shattered the moment Rio felt all at once as Agatha's hand moved and suddenly, without understanding how exactly, two fingers slipped inside her soaked entrance, curling back.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha! Fuck!"
     </em>
     she belted, the sound melting in a rich moan as she shifted down into the contact.
    </p>
<p>
     Between the steady pace of those fingers and the way Agatha's tongue delivered several kitten licks to her clit, it had taken Rio but a matter of moments to come undone, her orgasm plummeting from her stomach into her cunt as she rocked forward, the hand in Agatha's hair unclenching to release and fly up to the headboard to support herself.
    </p>
<p>
     Heat licked at every nerve, that pleasured churning pulling her under into a sea of pure rapture that she could have drowned in happily.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "O-oh. Ohhh my goddd,"
     </em>
     she somehow managed. Agatha had stopped her ministrations and was instead kissing and nibbling on the inner part of Rio's right thigh, but her fingers had not dislodged from their place inside of her body. Agatha was clearly aching to feel every dulling pulse until they were gone.
    </p>
<p>
     When she finally removed them, Rio slumped back, landing on her chest while her own was still heaving wildly.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "This is not the last time you'll be wearing this,"
     </em>
     Agatha announced decisively. There was absolutely no masking of that huskiness as it stained her tone. She raised an arm, hooking it over Rio's thigh so that she could brush her fingers along the exposed tufts of hair, framed by that green lace.
     <em>
      "This is the hottest fucking thing."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     A low hum left Rio through pressed lips, her eyes shut as her physicality seemed to settle a little more. They opened and dropped to Agatha beneath her, chin wet beneath that shit-eating grin she was wearing.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You think so?"
     </em>
     Rio drawled back lowly, a hand smoothing over her breasts and sternum in her post-orgasmic haze.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I know so. And it's going to look even better when I'm hip deep inside you in about five minutes. Maybe less."
     </em>
     The content was enough on its own to drop a cherry colored ball of hot lead into her stomach, but the way Agatha said it did something more. Rio honestly felt like she was going to combust; Agatha never had any qualm when it came to making her feelings known in regards to the love she had for Rio, but as the air stilled around them and the gravity of her words sank in, Rio realized that she showed it even louder than she spoke it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha loved Rio because of her heart, because of who she was.
    </p>
<p>
     The love that Agatha had for Rio's body was something else entirely, and when she was granted the opportunity to show it, Agatha made certain that Rio understood that she loved every single inch of it.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha worshipped her in the sanctity of their bedroom, something Rio might never get used to, but it didn't matter. It still meant the world to her all the same.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "To do that, though, you gotta let me up,"
     </em>
     she voiced, her hand withdrawing as her palm rested on the topmost part of Rio's thigh before giving it a soft tap of encouragement.
    </p>
<p>
     Instead of complying all the way, Rio shifted back so that she was straddling Agatha's stomach instead, leaning over as a hand raised to take hold of her chin. Rio's head lowered, tongue passing between parted lips as she lapped at Agatha's chin in one steady swipe before she pressed their lips together strongly, the kiss untamed in its delivery. Somewhere close to ten seconds in, Rio's body acted on its own accord, her hips grinding down to create pressure against that fabric covered ring above Agatha's bellybutton.
    </p>
<p>
     The sensation it caused induced a moan that spilled out of her, causing Agatha to jerk away, giving her thigh a rough squeeze.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Up!"
     </em>
     she ushered, although it seemed as if a new sense of urgency had struck her. When Rio didn't budge, Agatha sat up, causing Rio's body to tip back, though Agatha's arms were around her in the next second, not allowing her to fall. Instead, just as quickly as she'd launched upright, she was using her strength to rearrange them, swinging Rio over as Agatha herself found her knees and lowered her to the bed.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Two seconds,"
     </em>
     she muttered, taking a kiss that she ended with a drag of her tongue along Rio's upper lip, leaving her whimpering in want as they untangled so Agatha could climb into her harness. It had, of course, taken longer than two seconds, but damn if she wasn't efficient.
    </p>
<p>
     Somewhere in the process, Rio's hand had begun to wander, snaking its way down as her fingers dipped between folds, simply toying with herself, spreading them enough to be satisfying as she watched Agatha finish the process. She was still so focused, even as she walked to her nightstand to procure the coconut oil, using a small smattering of it to coat her shaft for good measure.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Agatha's attention lifted, though, something akin to both a scowl and a pout filled her face. "Hey! No! Stop that!" she cried, securing one last strap of leather before she scrambled onto the bed, finding herself posted above her wife on all fours.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio lazily withdrew her hand, letting it rest on her stomach as Agatha moved about to settle in a place she wanted to be in, knees flush against the mattress and poised between Rio's legs. There was a pause, a hesitance that creeped into the moment, but it was not awkward or out of place. It was a moment of reflection as Rio watched Agatha simply behold her, in every bit of her skimpy lingeried glory.
    </p>
<p>
     Admittedly, as much as Rio loved to kneel at the sight of Agatha's bare body, there was something so impossibly alluring and downright sexy about the vision of her in that getup. It was hot, it was fun, and it was simply so very
     <em>
      Agatha.
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     In a very simple and very short moment of undying appreciation, Agatha spoke.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I will be endlessly thankful that you were brought onto this earth, and that I found my way to you. Everything you are is all I will love, and I just need you to know."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     It was tender, it was almost too soft for the fact that Rio knew she was about to be fucked into the next century, but she understood it and she needed to hear it. Her expression practically melted and she raised the hand that had been resting on her belly. A beckoning finger called for Agatha before Rio made her request.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Kiss me first,"
     </em>
     she beguiled.
    </p>
<p>
     Without a moment's hesitation, Agatha rocked forward on her knees, palms landing on either side of Rio's head in the plush give of the pillow. That long, wild mane spilled over her shoulders and it was suddenly Rio's turn to regard her with nothing but endearment and fondness.
    </p>
<p>
     This was it, this was her wife, her life, her day and her night.
    </p>
<p>
     Even in the sweltering heat of their passion, the tenderness never waned.
    </p>
<p>
     There was something Rio found in the flush of Agatha's cheeks and forehead, a deep adulation that matched the one she could also locate in that insatiable gaze and devious curl of her lips. There in her eyes, there was nothing other than Rio. Rio could see it herself, almost like a reflection.
    </p>
<p>
     There, in Agatha's eyes, she could clearly see her own beauty, her own light, her own spark. There, mirrored in that gaze, Rio finally got the full scope of what her wife saw when she looked at her. It made no sense and yet, it made all the sense in the world at the same time.
    </p>
<p>
     Before she could slip into the thought and out of the moment, Agatha let her head lower enough to place a warm kiss against Rio's lips, a locking and sucking of soft flesh until she surmised that she had accomplished what had been asked of her. When she pulled away, Rio's eyes flickered open in time to watch as Agatha pressed herself back onto her knees, though she did not pass up the opportunity to drag her hands down the length of Rio's torso, landing on her hips.
    </p>
<p>
     She was both attentive and demanding in the way she sank her grip into both of Rio's thighs, pressing them upward until she could let them settle on her shoulders.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had been fixed, watching with her teeth nearly breaking through the skin of her lower lip, only offering minor assistance as Agatha positioned her where she wanted. Although it appeared as though this was her decision, her eyes snapped up to Rio and then over at the pillow next to her in her silent ask.
    </p>
<p>
     Accordingly, Rio handed the pillow over and felt herself practically go limp at the way Agatha fastened one arm over her legs, lifting her up by the hold so that she could place the newly acquired comfort beneath Rio's hips.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mmmm, baby,"
     </em>
     Rio hummed, her hand tapping against the bed. Without a verbal request, Agatha answered her by reaching for it, threading their fingers together as she placed their palms to Rio's hip. Using her other hand, Rio watched as Agatha dropped her focus to what she was doing, guiding herself forward.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment Rio felt the tip press against her, she sucked in a deep breath, trying to brace herself for what she knew was coming. Still, somehow, the moment Agatha eased her hips forward, she found herself unable to contain the moan that tore from deep within her lungs, skipping only as her breath caught in her throat.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Ohmygod, baby,"
     </em>
     she managed in a gasp, her eyes rolling back as Agatha sank further in. The fullness was always welcome, but with how utterly turned on she'd been since the moment Agatha had stuck her hand in her shorts, it was almost like victory. A very sweet, very satisfying victory.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio could feel it, the way Agatha's fingers between her own flexed in nothing but instinct. Her other hand had landed on her thigh, nails already beginning to sink into the pliant flesh there the moment she bottomed out, drawing another moan from somewhere so deep within Rio that it almost sounded inhuman.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Fucking -- Fuck, Rio,"
     </em>
     Agatha hissed, though she was still focused on those first few languid strokes before she lifted it to see nothing but intense and sensual delight plastered over every inch of Rio's expression.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's own fingers crooked, sinking into the back of Agatha's hand in one side and into the sheets on the other, gripping and tangling in some attempt to keep from losing herself to her pleasure.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Right -- Right there! But! Faster!"
     </em>
     she managed, her voice craggy and nearly broken as she tried to beg.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha tucked her bottom lip between her teeth and met the challenge, nails sinking deeper into Rio's skin as her hips began to swing with more intent, a deeper keenness. It was clear by that burning heat in her gaze that Agatha's only aim was to please. All she cared about was making Rio feel so fucking good she could hardly think. All Agatha wanted to do right then was hear her wife scream her name until she went hoarse, and she was going to see to it that she accomplished just that.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a point where Agatha hit a very specific angle, it nearly throttled Rio over the edge before she could even comprehend being close and while Agatha's next thrust hadn't graced the same spot, it had still caused Rio's grip to release on the sheets, shooting up to couple around Agatha's hand tightly.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's whimpers hadn't desisted for several long moments, broken by pathetic
     <em>
      fucks
     </em>
     and
     <em>
      oh my GODS.
     </em>
     The feeling had begun to pool in her lower belly, burning so impossibly hot that she had no idea how she wasn't bursting into flames.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Agatha,"
     </em>
     she forced out in a gasp of warning, though Agatha seemed to only find encouragement in it.
    </p>
<p>
     She adjusted slightly, allowing a slightly more upward angle as the working of her hips grew almost desperate. In an instant, Rio knew what she was trying to do and she also knew that it was going to work.
    </p>
<p>
     The pressure built, finally peaking before Agatha swung her hips once more, the tip of the dildo striking
     <em>
      just
     </em>
     the right spot as Rio's eyes flew back, rolling into her head so far she probably could have seen the core of the earth if she tried hard enough. Too occupied to even consider, her legs clenched, calves bearing down on Agatha's shoulders as she came. The whimpers were abandoned for louder moans and cries, her knuckles white as she gripped at Agatha, desperate to not let her go.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha did not stop. In fact, with each flex of her hips, Rio could feel the wet heat of her pleasure as it splashed out between them, though there was very little room for it to go anywhere other than to coat their skin.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "My fucking godddd,"
     </em>
     Agatha groaned, finally slowing her motions to a stop, though Rio had yet to make any other sound than a keening moan or weak whine, her body still twitching and her chest still heaving.
    </p>
<p>
     With measured care, Agatha gently untangled their hands and relocated Rio's legs, dropping them on either side of her to the bed. Rio realized that she was going to move and in a thoughtless reaction, she grabbed at her, not finding much to actually grab but managing a swipe of fingertips over her side.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "'Mere,"
     </em>
     Rio whimpered, eyes finally managing to open so that she could peer up at the goddess above her.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha listened and did as Rio hoped she would, repositioning so that she could lay forward and with great skill, she managed to stay buried inside Rio's body. It was nice, for a few moments, to stave off the inevitable emptiness. The way Rio felt as Agatha's weight sank into her, it was something she felt to be beyond words.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had read a lot of books, she had researched a lot of things. Rio knew how to speak and the right words to use -- most of the time -- but right then, there was simply no string of them that could have ever conveyed what she felt to be blanketed by the physical weight of the woman she loved irrevocably while being blanketed by the emotional weight of every feeling Agatha had for her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Happy birthday, my wife,"
     </em>
     Agatha breathed at her, their lips brushing faintly with her proximity.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio kissed her full-on before dropping a little further into the pillow, a satiated and fulfilled smile pulling on her lips.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Was that gift two?"
     </em>
     she teased, lifting a hand to run her fingers through Agatha's hair, pushing it out of her face.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Yes, two a,"
     </em>
     Agatha answered, pressing a couple of kisses to Rio's cheek.
     <em>
      "But we've still got gift two parts b, c, and d. You know, have to make sure you're well treated today."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio was giggling as she pulled Agatha to her, kissing her once more with a deliverance that again, she could not funnel into speech. It was warm and it was loving, an outpouring of  everything Rio just
     <em>
      needed
     </em>
     Agatha to know.
    </p>
<p>
     When she pulled away, her smile was not only visible on her expression, but it danced so playfully in her eyes.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You're actually insane,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha gave a shift of her hips, causing Rio to moan at the feeling it stirred within her.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "There's no reality where you would love me if I wasn't,"
     </em>
     Agatha offered in rebuttal, that daring smirk lifting those pink cheeks.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "That you are very right about, my love."
     </em>
</p>

</p>
<p>
     As it turned out, forty wasn't so terrible.
    </p>
<p>
     Granted, Rio was only two days into it, but something about it felt like an entirely newfound freedom that she had not ever really thought she'd needed.
    </p>
<p>
     There were things about it that were different for the first time in forty years. There was the fact that it was her first birthday since she was six that she had not spent in New Zealand. It was the first year it had not just been Rio and Estee and a small little cake split between them. It was the first time Rio had someone to spend it
     <em>
      with.
     </em>
     In fact, she had five other someones to spend it with.
    </p>
<p>
     Amassing all of those things, walking into another year of life felt more like swinging into it while sitting in a tire that dangled from the tallest Redwood. It was youthful freedom in a way that had been so unexpected. Forty didn't feel like forty.
    </p>
<p>
     Forty felt like the first year of Rio's new life.
    </p>
<p>
     Forty felt like a rebirth.
    </p>
<p>
     There was a newfound sense of lightness that had blossomed within her and it had not gone unnoticed. She had started singing again, something that had slipped from her subconscious for too many months to count. That morning, Rio was in the kitchen making them breakfast before Agatha left for work when she felt strong arms snake and fasten around her middle. Her rendition of The Ocean by Tegan and Sara was stopped short by her startled squeal, though it took her little time to melt right into Agatha's hold.
    </p>
<p>
     "Good morning, my love," Rio crooned warmly, turning her head enough to afford Agatha the opportunity to snag a kiss.
    </p>
<p>
     "Don't stop on my account," Agatha hummed in return as their lips parted and she pressed her own to Rio's cheek before allowing her to tend to the sausages she was cooking, though she didn't let her go.
    </p>
<p>
     "If I would have known that you were already down here, I would have stopped the moment your feet left the steps," came a return that was filtered through giggles.
    </p>
<p>
     "I wish you wouldn't. It's been a while since I've heard it. I missed it." It was a soft revelation, but Rio could hear the sincerity there. She knew that Agatha meant it because she felt the same way about Agatha's humming; it was a sign of happiness and contentment. It was an expression of what it meant to contain feelings that needed some form of release.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio thought about it for a moment; there had been no real reason that it had stopped other than life had simply gotten busy. Perhaps along the way, it had gotten a little more overwhelming than Rio had been giving it credit for. It held no negative connotations, not really, other than the weighted discussion the two of them had delved into in Iceland that then trickled down to the source of Nicky's several day absence. Everything else had just been... well, a lot.
    </p>
<p>
     For almost eleven months, Rio's life had been chaos and it had left her in a state where sometimes, she forgot her voice in more than one sense. She was finding it again, just as she had started to rediscover herself as well.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes, well," Rio offered as she removed the pan from the heat and made sure everything was turned off. Satisfied, Rio turned in Agatha's grasp and let her hands fall to Agatha's chest, a sweet smile finding her lips. "You don't hum as much as you used to."
    </p>
<p>
     This pointed observation seemed to be a revelation to Agatha, a brief wave of darkness washing over those blue irises Rio loved so much. Her lips twisted in thought, likely trying to source the cause of that in her own mind.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're right. I don't." Then came the grin. "Maybe we should work on that."
    </p>
<p>
     "I like it when we do team building exercises," Rio offered with another round of giggles, though she silenced any rebuttal Agatha was forming with a kiss.
     <em>
      "C'mon, let's eat,"
     </em>
     she murmured, pulling away to tend to their breakfast.
    </p>
<p>
     They had done just that, starting their Friday morning just before the sun decided to rise, and Agatha had departed to work. Rio, in a way, did the same.
    </p>
<p>
     Meetings were being set for contract bids on the drones. She was being selective about who she was agreeing to hear out, mostly because those drones were her entire professional world, and should she contract with someone who had less than honorable intentions, it would crush her. So far, she was set for two different meetings in San Francisco within the same three day period. Agatha knew, and while she had been encouraging and kind about it, Rio could see with crystal clarity that Agatha wanted to go, too.
    </p>
<p>
     She could have, but she also recognized that she had resumed the duty of her career and also that it would be a great exercise in learning how to be apart. They'd done it a couple of times, but it was never the most thrilling experience and Rio knew it was necessary that it be something that got worked further into the fixtures of their lives moving forward.
    </p>
<p>
     Occasional distance was healthy, and while it was going to be difficult to be away from her family, Rio was aware that there was justifiable reasoning to it.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time the day had rolled into afternoon, it was beautiful out and so, Rio had decided to change into her swimsuit and take a dip in the pool to make the most of the warm weather. Her swim had been peaceful, only accompanied by the sounds of the playlist she'd put on as it played over the speakers that were mounted to the upper corners of the pool house.
    </p>
<p>
     The water had been cool, the birds had been vocal, and there was a sense of serenity that had fallen over the back area of the house that Rio reveled in. With everyone constantly coming and going, Rio almost always assumed the house was empty unless obvious, so when she surfaced at the edge of the pool and saw twenty pedicured toes, she gasped, her eyes lifting to see her daughters grinning down at her, still in their pajamas.
    </p>
<p>
     "Lazy day today, then?" Rio posed, slicking her wet hair back and wiping the excess water from her face.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yes," Estee answered simply with a shrug, her hand picking up Tay's out of nothing more than habit. "But Gio's going to take us to In-N-Out and we wanted to see if you'd like to join us."
    </p>
<p>
     "Not today, thank you," Rio declined politely. "Agatha texted earlier and wants to go to Geoffrey's tonight for no apparent reason, so I figured I'd snack if I got hungry before then."
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, 'no apparent reason,' huh?" Tay jabbed back, grinning from ear to ear.
    </p>
<p>
     "We're getting up early tomorrow," Rio reminded them. "Which made me think... Where did Nicky and Hēmi run off to this morning?"
    </p>
<p>
     Estee began to answer but then stopped herself, instead fishing her phone from the pocket of her pajama pants, humming no particular tune as she pulled up his location -- through Snapchat, whatever the hell that was -- and grinned.
    </p>
<p>
     "They're at Dodger Stadium. Looks like they're at the game for the afternoon. Good, less griping," she added, though that mischievous twinkle in her eye betrayed her before her lips spread into a grin.
    </p>
<p>
     "Go, get your food! Don't be tempted to go to Venice! There's beach back there!" Rio urged through laughter, throwing a thumb over her shoulder to indicate the expanse of yard that eventually dropped off into sand.
    </p>
<p>
     "Alright, alright," Estee conceded. "If you need anything while we're out, just text."
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh! And!" Rio exclaimed, hopping up onto the edge of the pool, her arms folded as a foundation to keep her upright, head tipped back as she looked up at them. "In case you didn't hear it! We are getting up early tomorrow! Please! Do! Not! Be! Hungover! Disney will be miserable."
    </p>
<p>
     She was keeping it together, but it was clear that the humor Rio found in her own words was paramount to anything else being felt at that moment. She loved her children, each of them individually and the four of them collectively, but they were not free from the ability to make dumb decisions and if anyone threw up on a roller coaster, it would be misery for everyone.
    </p>
<p>
     The look that found Estee in return was pointed and sharp, but not quite a glare. "Yes. We are getting up early in the morning. So... Maybe go to bed before 3am half-drunk after being loud." She hadn't finished speaking before her attempt at a serious facade completely cracked and her amusement seized her.
    </p>
<p>
     "'Being loud,'" Rio mocked haughtily, sticking her tongue out before she lowered herself back into the water fully. "We'll give it a good effort, good enough?"
    </p>
<p>
     Estee rolled her eyes and waved Rio off as she turned and pulled Tay away.
    </p>
<p>
     "Los amos mis hijas!" Rio called after them, still grinning like the absolute shit she knew herself to be right then.
    </p>
<p>
     "Te amo, mama!" they both called at the same time before disappearing into the house.
    </p>
<p>
     For another fifteen minutes or so, Rio had continued to swim and bask in the sunlight, but when Estee announced they were officially leaving, she decided to climb out and towel off. After a shower, she found herself back outside, this time in a lounger with a book in her lap, adorning a pair of sunglasses. She'd even had the forethought to bring a glass of chilled white wine, something that turned out to be the perfect accompaniment.
    </p>
<p>
     She had read for hours until her phone had buzzed; Agatha informed her of her ETA and indicated that when she went upstairs to select something for Agatha to wear, she would find her own dress in a garment bag in the back of her side of the closet. There were rarely ever thoughts that could transform into words when Rio read messages like those ones.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was so wily, but so devoted. She could be full of mischief and sometimes a bit vague, but she was always true with her intentions. When she returned home to find Rio clad in that thin but not quite sheer green dress that cinched around her waist, Agatha had not wasted even a single second before sweeping Rio up into a warm and longing kiss.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It's been like eight hours,"
     </em>
     Rio had teased, the merriment spilling out of her in the form of laughter.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You look really hot, though. Just let me have it,"
     </em>
     Agatha had purred back, greedily stealing another heated but too-short kiss.
     <em>
      "Mmmm, I should get dressed, hm? What's it for me today?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio tipped her head toward the closet door, doing the best to keep the smirk from curling her lips. She succeeded, but the smug look that etched itself into her features won out instead.
    </p>
<p>
     There, hanging from the handle were four things.
    </p>
<p>
     A) A pair of black high-waisted trousers.
     <br/>
     B) A sheer black top with solid black polka dots.
     <br/>
     C) A black bralette.
     <br/>
     D) A pair of black suspenders that had an intricate white patten pressed into them.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had passed it over many times, and she had never actually gotten to see Agatha in it in person, but there were enough photos of her wearing it on head4harkness that Rio had developed an absolute need.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oh,"
     </em>
     Agatha breathed, eyebrows raising in delighted surprise. "And where did the idea for this one come from?" she added in question, though the moment Rio's lips split to reveal a toothy grin her eyes rolled back. "I should have known! Damn head4harkness! I need to find out her government name so I can curse her properly when she inspires your shenanigans."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio wasn't sure what it was about that day, but the laughter... it just seemed to find her. It had found her in the pool when the girls had been present. She had been giggly over her book, and right then, Agatha nearly had her in stitches with such a reaction.
    </p>
<p>
     "You leave that poor woman alone," Rio shot back, playfully prodding both of Agatha's sides with heavy fingertips. "She's going to work of any and all goddesses above."
    </p>
<p>
     Before Rio could even understand what she was doing, Agatha raised the arm that wasn't secured around Rio's waist to plant her palm over Rio's face, pushing her back as she, too, began to laugh.
    </p>
<p>
     "Hey!" Rio attempted, but it was muffled at best. So, instead, her lips parted and she managed to swipe her tongue over a small section of Agatha's palm, causing her to shriek as she jerked it away, feigning disgust.
    </p>
<p>
     "You're gross!" she tried to accuse, but she was already breaking. Rio could see it in the way the corners of her mouth were twitching before she pursed her lips to stave off her smile. "I can't bel-- RIO!"
    </p>
<p>
     She had tried to keep her thinly veiled badgering, but any hopes Agatha had been keeping that she could even appear to be surly was shattered the moment Rio lunged forward and licked her cheek, not caring about the taste of foundation she was immediately met with.
    </p>
<p>
     "Why's it only gross if I lick you when you still have your clothes on?! Seems hypocritical!"
    </p>
<p>
     They were both in hysterics, their chests rattling with their sounds of happiness and tickled joy. Together, they were a machine of endless emotion, the good, the bad, and the best, and it was a life that Rio knew she simply could never tire of.
    </p>
<p>
     "Because now I have to wash my face and reapply my make-up so we can go out!" Agatha finally managed back, her hold loosening around Rio's waist as she attempted to calm herself.
    </p>
<p>
     "Oh, no! Whatever will you do?!" Rio mocked, slapping her cheeks in a fake display of distress. The moment her hands dropped, though, they were replaced with Agatha's in the blink of an eye. She squeezed and tugged Rio forward, taking her turn to lick a clean line in the direct center of her forehead.
    </p>
<p>
     When she pulled away, she looked pleased with her work.
    </p>
<p>
     "Now come on, let's go wash our faces."
    </p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     Dinner, as Rio had been so certain it would be, had been phenomenal. Geoffrey's was never a disappointment, and watching the waves roll in as they ate, crashing softly in the distance, only added to the ambiance. They talked, they laughed, they clinked their glasses more than a few times as they indulged in the fine wines.
    </p>
<p>
     In the times those lower conversations befell them, the top of Rio's foot would find the side of Agatha's calf, caressing it in the smallest strokes while she attentively held active conversation. Agatha seemed to be the one faltering there more often than not.
    </p>
<p>
     Despite just how close to the beach their home was, the waited had divulged something toward the end of their meal. His eyes had cast toward the water, shimmering in the moonlight.
    </p>
<p>
     "You can't see it that well from up here," he indicated, "but another customer said that there's a bioluminescent bloom tonight. They're hard to predict, so if you've never seen one, you should."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew exactly what that was, and what it meant when he said they were difficult to track and understand. Her wide eyes turned to Agatha, giddy with excitement. She'd seen many before, but never in California. It felt special and perhaps even a little poetic that on an occasion they'd indulged in a pricey plate for absolutely no reason, it was also providing a special experience that Rio could only have for the first time once.
    </p>
<p>
     When she had started to ask as he had walked away, Agatha hadn't let her get out a word edgewise before offering her answer.
    </p>
<p>
     "Of course we can."
    </p>
<p>
     In the darkness of a night, their feet in the water, Rio had been filled with a sense of sheer elation to be watching the blues and greens as they lit up the waters that lapped at their calves. It might have seemed childish, but Rio had spent so, so many years on Auckland beaches doing this exact thing. Sometimes she was alone, something Estee was there to indulge in the glee as well.
    </p>
<p>
     Now, Rio stood on the west coast of America with her hand snugly grasped in her wife's as they experienced it together.
    </p>
<p>
     That, Rio thought, was what life looked like. Progress. Experience. Jubilation.
    </p>
<p>
     By the time they had arrived home, the wine had induced an unparalleled tiredness that felt hard to fight. After a brief internal debate, Rio had put on a pot of coffee and returned for a cup after she had changed. Per Agatha's request, she'd fixed her one too and arrived back in the bedroom to settle in.
    </p>
<p>
     In an attempt to keep herself awake, Rio had cracked open a book -- another Jodi Picoult piece, Vanishing Acts -- and put on her glasses to read.
    </p>
<p>
     Some part of her had fully intended on reading.
    </p>
<p>
     The other part of her knew what was going to happen the moment she slid those frames onto her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha had tried to act like she didn't notice, but Rio saw her look over a couple of times in an almost imperceptible manner before she would turn her attention back to the cooking show she had put on. And then, about five minutes later, her hand landed on Rio's thigh.
    </p>
<p>
     That was all it had taken before hands were flying and mouths were meshing, tongues pressing and tasting and devouring.
    </p>
<p>
     As she often did, Agatha made Rio keep her glasses on. It was amusing and yet, still somehow sweet despite the tinge of absurdity it seemed to hold. Rio met the request every single time, knowing that if it gave Agatha that extra little push to be that much more obsessed? Who was Rio to stop her?
    </p>
<p>
     At one point, they had actually fallen off. Rio wasn't quite sure when, but by the time they were sprawled out on the bed, thoroughly spent and pleasured, her face was bare and smushed against the front of Agatha's shoulder. The panting had lasted several minutes, but recovery crept into their forms eventually.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Mm, what time is it?"
     </em>
     Rio murmured, her speech morphed only slightly by the placement of her face.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha's arm flopped out, fingers gracing the edge of the nightstand, but not reaching quite far enough to grab her phone. When she shifted, it drew a rather pathetic sounding whine from Rio who clung a little tighter to prevent any occurrence of distance.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "One-twelve,"
     </em>
     Agatha whispered back. She dropped the phone onto the bed beside her and settled back into place, pulling Rio a little closer to her form.
     <em>
      "Fuck, we have to be up at seven."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     For what felt like the millionth time since she had woken up that morning, the gift of laughter settled in Rio once again. It was a quiet sound, hushed as it rolled from her lips and over the skin of Agatha's chest.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "We're going to need something stronger than coffee. If I miss the shock on Tay's face, I'm going to be so mad,"
     </em>
     came Agatha's tired insistence.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio adjusted slightly, hooking her leg over Agatha's so that her body could overlap a little more, reveling in the warmth and safety she found there.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "You focus on Tay for me, hm?"
     </em>
     Rio posed, though she hadn't stopped to think about what she was implying. When Agatha shifted slightly and then asked her question, Rio knew that she had completely fucked up. Well, with less than twelve hours to go, was telling her wife of all people the worst thing?
    </p>
<p>
     But she'd
     <em>
      promised
     </em>
     Tay she wouldn't say anything.
    </p>
<p>
     Maybe Agatha wouldn't press. Maybe she wasn't paying enough attention to understand the implications there.
    </p>
<p>
     That was foolish; even completely worn out from their physical activity, Agatha was
     <em>
      always
     </em>
     paying attention.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "And where will you be paying your attention?"
     </em>
     she asked lowly, pressing a couple of fingers tauntingly between Rio's ribs.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Oh, I just meant --"
     </em>
     Rio tried to recover, but she knew it was unlikely Agatha would buy any excuse she had to offer.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "What did you just mean, my love?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Tucking her lower lip between her teeth, Rio quickly came to the conclusion that there was no point in trying to keep the secret any longer, at least not from Agatha of all people. She had done a remarkable job to that point, keeping it as far away from her consciousness as possible, but the jig was up and there was no reason to hold out anymore.
    </p>
<p>
     A resigned sigh passed through Rio's lips, a hand raising to trace light circles on Agatha's chest.
     <em>
      "I just meant that Tay is proposing, too. So someone's gotta watch Estee."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The news landed and the roots planted in Agatha's mind, sinking deeper and deeper until they struck her comprehension.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "No fucking way,"
     </em>
     she breathed back in her disbelief. Her hand slid up Rio's back, touching her neck with a soft gracing of fingertips that requested attention. It took Rio a few long seconds to make the decision to meet it. When she did, the disbelief written on Agatha's features, even in the dark, something softened in Rio.
     <em>
      "Double proposal?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     Rio nodded her head, though it was still like a dead weight as it rested just inches away from Agatha's heart.
     <em>
      "Double proposal. But you
      <b>
       have
      </b>
      to act normal!"
     </em>
     Rio's insistence was accompanied by a light tap of two fingers to Agatha's chest in the most gently threatening gesture.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I always act normal,"
     </em>
     Agatha offered back, feigning offense as she lifted a hand to poke Rio's cheek in jest.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Yeah, oh-kay,"
     </em>
     Rio shot, rolling her eyes. She scooted herself up enough to grace Agatha's lips with her own.
     <em>
      "We should sleep, my love."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "Double fucking proposal. Goddamn,"
     </em>
     Agatha breathed with a grin before puckering her lips one more time in demand. When Rio kissed her again, her eyes closed and when Rio settled back into her side, they did not open again.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "Love is quite wonderful, hm?"
     </em>
     Rio whispered into the night. Her hand had landed in the center of Agatha's chest, right above her heart.
    </p>
<p>
     She could hear the soft huff of agreement above her as it slipped from Agatha's nose. Before she returned her hushed answer, her fingers began to trace the gentlest lines up and down Rio's bare back.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "It is. It's why we're here, isn't it?"
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     For every negative opinion that existed in the world about Agatha, Rio knew the truth.
    </p>
<p>
     Agatha was an incredible person, not just for her talents and her abilities. No, Agatha's heart was unlike any other Rio had ever come across, even outside of a romantic context. Agatha
     <em>
      did
     </em>
     care, she just didn't always show it the way people thought she should.
    </p>
<p>
     When had Agatha done anything other people thought she should in the last decade?
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "And always will be,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured softly, words slurring minutely as the exhaustion began to win its battle to take her offer.
     <em>
      "Sleep now. I love you."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      "I love you too, baby."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     *****
    </p>
<p>
     The first time Agatha started to grumble about being tired, Rio had immediately pressed her finger to Agatha's lips and urged her to finish her coffee by the time they got to the park. Agatha had tried to look annoyed, but she knew that Rio was right.
    </p>
<p>
     She also knew that the reason for such tiredness had been entirely worth it. Rio didn't need to point that out vocally, though. Especially not in front of the kids who had all met them in the kitchen to prepare for the day ahead of them. For Rio, cradling her black coffee in her hands, it was a compelling feeling to see the excitement and invigoration running through the kids.
    </p>
<p>
     Nicky had been to Disneyland before, of course, but the other three had not and so, it had been an ongoing promise from Nicky that it was going to be magical.
    </p>
<p>
     Every time he did it, Rio's attention would snap to the girls, seeing if either of them might offer any give, but neither did. They stayed composed, masked, ready to take on a day that was sure to change their lives moving forward.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had her own ideas; she knew that they both wanted that commitment, but there was something else that had struck Rio: Maybe they wanted a family a little sooner than Rio had anticipated. It wasn't an overt display, but the smallest comments that got dropped that piqued her interest and helped her to form such an opinion.
    </p>
<p>
     Her girls just wanted to truly start living life.
    </p>
<p>
     She was well aware that when the time came for the important conversations to be had, Estee would sit her down and have them. Until then, Rio had to sometimes remind herself that her little girl wasn't quite so little anymore and she was making very adult choices that she thought were going to better her life. Rio would always respect that.
    </p>
<p>
     Loading into the massive SUV was always comical, but that morning it had garnered an extra laugh when Gio shook his head with a soft chuckle.
    </p>
<p>
     "Respectfully, ma'ams, you can't pick up any strays or we're going to have to upgrade to a limo."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's grin had been so instant and so wide that she considered for a moment that her face held the capability of cracking from it.
    </p>
<p>
     "Might have to do that, anyway! Thanks for the idea, Gio. You're always a genius," Agatha offered as she climbed into the back of the vehicle.
    </p>
<p>
     For as excited as the kids were, when they had arrived at the park, Rio had immediately felt an easily established sense of wonder. While Estee never passed up an opportunity to make a dig about how little media Rio had consumed before meeting Agatha, Disney films had been universal, including in their world.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing the different attractions, watching as the kids indulged in the rides, eating lunch as a family through laughter and shenanigans were some of the things that had filled the first part of their day, and the fun felt endless.
    </p>
<p>
     Everyone, surprisingly, had been keeping their cool. There were two people -- Hēmi and Nicky -- who were eager and ready for Estee to propose. Then, there were the other two -- Agatha and Rio herself -- that knew the intensity of what was going to occur. And then, there were the girls who had no idea that they were of the same mind and were likely only going to find another way to fall further into love with one another.
    </p>
<p>
     After lunch, they'd continued about the park until they had reached Snow White's Grotto.
    </p>
<p>
     And then, the wishing well.
    </p>
<p>
     Estee was ready; she'd tucked two quarters in the same pocket that held the little red velvet box. Rio pulled Agatha to the side by the hand, shuffling close enough to be within earshot.
    </p>
<p>
     "We should make a wish," Estee told Tay, handing the coin over with a bright smile. Rio could see from their vantage point as the flicker of recognition danced across Tay's gaze. To her, this was innocent and without intention and it was an opening she could use to further her agenda. And that agenda was to ask Estee to be her wife.
    </p>
<p>
     "We should," Tay agreed, thanking her softly as she took the coin. "Same time?" she asked, holding the coin up. It was locked and loaded, ready to be flipped into the well.
    </p>
<p>
     "Same time," Estee agreed with a nod. "One... Two... Three!"
    </p>
<p>
     Concurrently, both girls flipped the coins into the well with the softest clinks of keratin fingernails striking silver. They both watched for a moment before they leaned back and looked at one another.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio's hand found Agatha's and locked it into a vice grip, not certain who was going to break first.
    </p>
<p>
     It was Tay.
    </p>
<p>
     "I know you're not supposed to tell what you wished for..." she said, turning to face Estee as she picked up her hand. On her opposite side, she was reaching into her pocket. "But I think if I do, it's not going to ruin my chances of it coming true."
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had caught the way Estee's free hand had come to rest in her pocket, not leaving even as she turned to face her girlfriend a little more. Agatha bumped into her, scooting her over so they wouldn't miss anything.
    </p>
<p>
     When Tay pulled the box from her pocket, she dropped to one knee and held it up, the hinged lid open and revealing the three pronged solitaire diamond ring inside. The band was thin and it was a lone stone, but it was a decent size. It wasn't flashy or bougie. It was... so very Estee.
    </p>
<p>
     "I wished that you'd love me just enough to agree to be my wife," Tay informed her. "So do you think you might help it come true?"
    </p>
<p>
     Rio was locked on Estee, watching her realize that her perfectly crafted plan had completely fallen to shambles in the most beautiful way. Her hand did not fly to her mouth, she did not gasp or squeal or cry. Hell, she didn't even vocalize an answer. All Estee did was remove her hand from her pocket, holding the ring box out for Taylah to see.
    </p>
<p>
     "Only if you'd return the favor," Estee told her softly.
    </p>
<p>
     It was in that moment that four pairs of eyes glassed over and the true elation of what was unfolding started to sink in. Even the boys looked a little verklempt at the turn of events they had
     <em>
      not
     </em>
     been expecting. They'd anticipated Estee knocking this out of the park, not a clue to be had that Tay had secretly been making her own moves.
    </p>
<p>
     "The only thing I'd love more than that is you," Tay answered, getting to her feet. The moment she was planted, she pulled Estee to her, offering a kiss that Estee returned with ease. It was a beautiful gesture, a showing of how much they loved one another. It was a decades long love, and it was one that would continue to span throughout time.
    </p>
<p>
     The whoops and hollers were intended to be embarrassing as they left the four others, but Rio realized that neither of the girls heard them. Neither of the girls heard anything other than the silent conversation they were having with their foreheads pressed together and their lips a breath apart.
    </p>
<p>
     With another gentle brushing of lips, they separated from one another but only to tend to the important part. They both grinned instantly as Estee was the first one to pluck the ring -- which Rio had known was a platinum round cut with a jewel encrusted band -- so that she could slide it onto Tay's finger.
    </p>
<p>
     Only a moment passed before Tay returned the favor, sliding that gorgeous tear drop diamond onto Estee's ring finger.
    </p>
<p>
     The way they each clutched empty boxes in one hand and raised the other to palm the opposing cheek before their lips met in a kiss filled with nothing but love and adoration caused Rio to melt.
    </p>
<p>
     This was all she had ever wanted for Estee.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio had spent eighteen years of Estee's life doing anything and everything she could to provide for her, to take care of her and remind her every second of every day that she was loved so wholly and so relentlessly. Estee had been Rio's entire world, and she still was, but she had become Tay's world, too.
    </p>
<p>
     Their love had always been obvious, even if it had shifted in context and now, they were looking at building a life together. Their careers were being planted to grow and thrive with time and so now was their future as a couple, too.
    </p>
<p>
     The moment seemed to stretch on, even though their kisses tapered off and they were simply left basking in the reality of what had happened, and the new weight of the rocks on their fingers. When their heads finally lifted to take in the sight of Rio and Agatha, only one of them was crying and it was very obviously Rio. With the eye contact, she got her permission and let go of Agatha's hand to surge forward and wrap them both in her arms.
    </p>
<p>
<em>
      "I knew this day was inevitable,"
     </em>
     Rio murmured at them both, holding them close,
     <em>
      "but it was far more magical than I'd ever thought it could be."
     </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
      *****
     </em>
</p>
<p>
     The six of them had reveled in the joy and excitement the double engagement had brought with a crowd around them offering their soft congratulations as they passed by. It was sweet, really, and heartwarming in a way that Rio hardly knew how to explain. It was watching the inevitable finally fall into place, propelling their lives forward in new ways.
    </p>
<p>
     While Rio was not of forward enough mind to be thinking about wedding planning and things of that nature, Agatha was already buzzing, waiting for the first chance she got to give the girls anything they wanted and more. She felt them to be deserving of all the best in the world, and she started proving it the moment they left the park, each and every one of them donning an almost painful grin.
    </p>
<p>
     Gio, per Agatha's quiet instruction, had taken them to Fleming's Steakhouse for a celebratory dinner. The alcohol was pouring and the children were happily indulging, but Rio's only drink for the evening was her solitary celebratory glass of champagne that Agatha had used to toast.
    </p>
<p>
     She stood beside Rio and held her own glass up, her eyes falling to Estee and Tay who were so close they were practically on top of each other, grinning like the sweet and in-love drunkenly adorable idiots they were.
    </p>
<p>
     "I knew this day was coming, I just wasn't sure when," Agatha announced, watching them tenderly. Rio was right beside her, that softness filling her features as she beheld two of the five people she loved most in the world. "But that day, the first day, that I met you both... I knew. And watching the both of you, from an outsider's perspective, has been the most thrilling delight. You both grow and learn and build every single day so that you may have a life you both want and crave. You have a tenacity woven into the fabric of your relationship that is truly remarkable and inspiring."

     Agatha glanced down to Rio who looked back up at her, the emotionally moved tears brimming her lids as she smiled through the squeezing in her chest. Her head lifted again, finding herself basking in the love that radiated from the younger couple.
    </p>
<p>
     "So here is to you, Estrella and Taylah, and the many years of love and marriage ahead of you."
    </p>
<p>
     There was something in Rio that was thankful that Agatha was the one to take the helm on such a toast; Rio was not as certain in her ability to be so articulate in the face of such emotion. More than that, it was a pure and honest showing that for Agatha, they were her girls, too, and seeing this happen for them was just as special for her as it was for Rio.
    </p>
<p>
     Seeing that in her wife formed a new sense of reverence that Rio felt was a little to complex to fit into any vernacular.
    </p>
<p>
     "I'll cheers to that!" Rio offered, standing to offer her glass as well. Everyone was up and on their feet around the circular table between them, holding their glasses up, grins matching and light laughter swirling and mixing around them before the crisp clinks of glasses folded right in.
    </p>
<p>
     They had all settled and continued on with the evening, but Rio had not missed the way Agatha had spent a considerable amount of time on her phone, even if she had not been able to catch sight of what was on the screen. It didn't matter, Agatha told them anyway when she was finished and set her phone back on the table.
    </p>
<p>
     "You two have a suite at the Grand Californian Hotel and Spa, which happens to have park access. So... Stay there the next two nights and go to the park again tomorrow just the two of you, my congratulatory gift." Even though the gesture was soft, Agatha was trying to speak of it like a business transaction despite there clearly being so much more weight there.
    </p>
<p>
     Rio knew the truth. Agatha was trying not to cry.
    </p>
<p>
     That became a little easier when Nicky spoke.
    </p>
<p>
     "So we get a room at the Ritz?" he questioned, dissolving everyone into tipsy laughter.
    </p>
<p>
     "You have an entirely separate house to yourselves," Agatha returned, as if he needed a reminder. "You want a night at the Ritz, you've got a credit card."
    </p>
<p>
     It was a similar conversation to one they'd had earlier that week, but the playfulness glimmered in Agatha's eyes. Nicky took it for what it was.
    </p>
<p>
     "Yeah, but I'd be too cheap and get a room at a Motel 6, so pool house it is."
    </p>
<p>
     More laughter, more eye rolling, more gentle nudges and playful pushes.
    </p>
<p>
     With their dinner coming to a close, there was something that struck Rio as they climbed into the back of the car to drop the girls off at the resort before heading home.
    </p>
<p>
     She needed to stop having limits; too many times had she marked a moment in her life as being the best it was ever going to get.
    </p>
<p>
     That was never going to stop happening.
    </p>
<p>
     Life was only ever going to get better, no matter the dips that might come.
    </p>
<p>
     Together, the family they had become, life would never stop in its ability to be more astounding the next day than the one before it.
    </p>
<p>
     It was a life Rio could never show enough gratitude for and she knew it.
