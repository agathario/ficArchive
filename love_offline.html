<div class="userstuff">
<p> </p><p>The ugly truth comes out on a random Tuesday in early May, once again demonstrating that the existence of Tuesdays as a whole provides absolutely no value to humanity or the world at large.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s demolishing a bowl of pasta from the Italian place down the road that’s good enough to justify their eye-watering menu prices when the door to her office swings open, allowing—of all people—her gorgeous girlfriend to step inside. Filled with an absolutely sickening sense of déjà vu, Agatha fumbles for her phone. Unfortunately, it’s too late. Getting caught with her hand down her pants while watching a shitty porno with an equally shitty pun-based title like <em>Saving Ryan’s Privates</em> or something just as shitty and dumb would’ve been less humiliating than this. By a wide, wide, <em>wide</em> margin.</p><p> </p><p>Rio pauses after shutting the door behind her. She tilts her head in confusion, very much resembling a puppy failing to stick out its paws as their owner tries to do the wall test on them. Agatha wants to bounce her own head off the wall.</p><p> </p><p>“Were you—”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean, it sure sounded like—”</p><p> </p><p>“I wasn’t.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.” The corners of Rio’s mouth twitch, threatening to break into a smile. “Were you watching my mukbang videos over lunch?”</p><p> </p><p>“Absolutely not. That would be ridiculous. And stupid. Ridiculous <em>and</em> stupid.”<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>To really hammer the point home, Agatha balls up a napkin and throws it her. The sad crumpled little wad doesn’t even make it more than half a foot away from her desk before falling to the floor. Rio huffs out a laugh as she walks forward, crouching down to pick up the napkin and toss it into the bin before rounding the corner of Agatha’s desk.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. It <em>might</em> be a bit ridiculous, I’ll give you that.” Rio reaches out and grabs the arm of Agatha’s ergonomic chair to keep her from rolling away in mutiny. “But only because I’d like to think that my beautiful, amazing, talented, <em>wonderful</em> girlfriend already knows that she can just FaceTime me instead. You do know that, right?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha scowls.</p><p> </p><p>“Flattery will get you nowhere.”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? So on Sunday, when I told you I’d rather peel that cute floral sundress off of you with my teeth instead of going out to dinner and you let me—what was that all about?”</p><p> </p><p>The memory of Rio dragging Agatha’s underwear down off of her body before slowly kissing a burning path back up to the apex of her thighs resurfaces in Technicolor. Rio had moaned at the first taste of her arousal, eyes sliding shut in apparent bliss, and hadn’t resurfaced from between her legs until Agatha had breathlessly informed Rio that she was on the verge of passing out. Then—and <em>only</em> then—had she deigned to give Agatha a break from her exceptionally talented tongue.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha shivers, and Rio’s sly smile gains a sharply knowing edge.</p><p> </p><p>Rather feebly, Agatha decides to give up the ghost.</p><p> </p><p>“Fine,” she snaps, leaning back in her chair. Agatha narrowly resists the urge to cross her arms as she continues. “Yes, I watch your videos at lunch. It’s a habit, okay? Sue me, it’s just nice to have company that I know won’t annoy me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why not just call me directly, sweetheart? I’d love to eat with you. Any time.”</p><p> </p><p>“Well—I mean, you’re working too! Don’t you have better things to do than to sit around on a video call with me for an hour?”</p><p> </p><p>This does not turn out to be the “<em>gotcha!</em>” moment that Agatha’s brain had assumed it would be.</p><p> </p><p>“Baby, I get a lunch hour too! And I work in a pretty chill lab; I can take it whenever. So if you just tell me when you’re planning to have your break, I can make sure to take mine at the same time. It’s no big deal.”</p><p> </p><p>That, embarrassingly enough, checks out. <em>Alright</em>. Agatha squirms in her seat, feeling even dumber than before. One of Rio’s hands finds a home along the curve of her jaw, prompting Agatha to lift her gaze.</p><p> </p><p>“My love,” Rio begins, and wow, she needs to knock it off with the nicknames soon because Agatha’s body is starting to react on instinct. She’s been fucking <em>conditioned</em>. It’s sick and twisted, is what it is. Rio’s thumb starts to stroke her cheek, brushing against the corner of her mouth. Agatha melts into the warmth of her touch. “You’ll call me next time, yeah?”</p><p> </p><p>The puppy eyes make a comeback. This is so unfair.</p><p> </p><p>What’s there to do but give in?</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Because Agatha’s nothing if not a creature of comforting routine, she settles in for her usual evening scroll as soon as she gets home.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s comment section, naturally, remains a cesspool of horny lesbian degeneracy. Under a video compilation of Rio unsnapping her suspenders in a week’s worth of outfits post-work, Agatha gets down to the serious business of indulging in her favorite pastime: snooping and being a judgmental bitch.</p><p> </p><p><em>I need her to put her hand in my ***** and wear me around like a Muppet. A MUPPET do you hear me</em> ✊‼️</p><p> </p><p>“Now <em>there’s</em> a real freak,” Agatha mouthes quietly to herself, smirking and shaking her head.</p><p> </p><p><em>no lube no protection all night all day from the kitchen floor to the toilet seat from the dining table to the bedroom from the bathroom sink to the shower from the front porch to the balcony vertica</em>—</p><p> </p><p>The comment gets cut off mid-word. Ugh. Arbitrary character limits ruin everything. Agatha chuckles and swipes onwards, wading into the abyss.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>ohhhh i would keep her strap SO warm believe meeeee</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Agatha squints at this one.</p><p> </p><p>“You’ll never get the chance, <em>witchluvr13</em>,” she mutters around a derisive snort. “Ever.”</p><p> </p><p>At least, not if Agatha has anything to say about it. That’s <em>her</em> girlfriend and therefore <em>her</em> rightful place in Rio’s lap, riding Rio’s favorite emerald green strap. The next comment follows a similarly raunchy train of thinking.</p><p> </p><p>
<em>daddy rio idc if the strap fake i said NUT IN ME !!!!!!!!!</em>
</p><p> </p><p>Again, Agatha laughs. If strap-slingers could get people pregnant, Agatha would’ve already fucked around and found out, so to speak. In another world, they’d probably be having a December baby this very same year.</p><p> </p><p><em>My ovaries fr just dapped each other up ong</em> 🫦</p><p> </p><p><em>mmmmmmm looks like my ride is here</em> 😮‍💨</p><p> </p><p><em>my pussy just exploded after watching this video. 5 dead and 7 injured. more at 11</em> 🥵</p><p> </p><p>This is how Rio finds her: cackling on the couch and kicking her feet at the unmatched audacity of the entire thirsty wlw TikTok community.</p><p> </p><p>“Have you ever considered just making a reaction video with me?” Rio asks, wrapping a hand around Agatha’s left ankle and dragging her to lie flat across the cushions. Agatha’s shrill shriek of surprise quickly cuts off as Rio moves to straddle her, dark eyes gleaming wickedly. “Then everyone will get to see your beautiful face and know that one: I’m taken, and two: I managed to bag the hottest woman on the planet. Thoughts?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s gonna take all the fun out of it. I like judging people in private, babe. It’s my passion.”</p><p> </p><p>Laughing, Rio moves in close to press their mouths together. The kiss starts softly, staying slow and unhurried despite Agatha’s best efforts to wind Rio up. Rio bites gently at Agatha’s bottom lip before breaking away and leaning back.</p><p> </p><p>“You, Agatha Harkness, are the biggest brat I’ve ever met.”</p><p> </p><p>What a spurious and untrue accusation to levy against an innocent woman. Agatha sticks out her tongue to disprove it.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Nowadays, Agatha’s generally unbothered by the rampant, lurid, brow-raising depravity under Rio’s videos.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hot, and the Internet loves hot people. (In other news, forks keep being found in kitchens.) Kayla from Missouri, however—Agatha’s unwitting arch-nemesis—possesses a special knack for getting under Agatha’s skin.</p><p> </p><p><em>HOT!!!</em> reads Kayla’s latest comment. <em>this made my hole weak. i mean, my whole week. do it again ;)</em></p><p> </p><p>Oh, hell no.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s jaw makes a sincere attempt to tunnel into the center of the earth. Kayla from Bumfuck, Missouri is getting a visit from SWAT <em>tomorrow</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“<b><em>Rio!</em></b>” Agatha bellows and, to her credit, Rio comes sprinting into the bedroom so speedily that the door can’t swing open fast enough to match her momentum, leading to a very Looney Tunes-esque collision that sends her toppling.</p><p> </p><p>“What?!” Rio yelps from the floor, scrambling to get off her ass. “What happened?!”</p><p> </p><p>Fuming, Agatha stomps over like one of the Kaiju making a break for dry land, a monster searching for a city to trample. She quickly yanks Rio upright before pointing at the phone screen.</p><p> </p><p>“Block her. <em>Now</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio silently squints in the direction being indicated by Agatha’s quivering index finger, mouth working open and closed in a very fishlike manner.</p><p> </p><p>“Block… kissthecook7928?”</p><p> </p><p>Wait. That can’t possibly be right. Agatha angles the phone back towards herself. Ah, she must’ve swiped a little on her way over. Agatha swipes back to the correct comment before brandishing the screen in Rio’s direct line of sight once more.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh. You want me to block kaylashayla31?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha growls.</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Obviously</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>“I mean. Sure. Of course I’ll block her, babe. We can do whatever you want.” Rio reaches out to stroke Agatha’s waist in a transparent attempt to mollify her ire. It doesn’t work. Much. “But, um… Can I ask why?”</p><p> </p><p>“The woman’s clearly deranged! Did you see what she wrote?” <em>The indecorous madwoman. Unrepentant she-devil. That lecherous, damnable knave!!!</em></p><p> </p><p>“I mean… I kinda think that the Muppet line two comments above it is weirder, honestly, but yeah. I’ve been seeing that come up in my notifs more and more lately. It’s a popular copy-paste that’s been making the rounds.”</p><p> </p><p>Illegal Fourth of July fireworks have gone off with less of a bang than Agatha does in the next moment.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, but Kayla is <em>evil</em>,” she explodes, eyes wild, gesturing broadly. “She means it! She <em>wants</em> you. She lives in the middle of nowhere, Missouri—where there probably aren’t even any good labs you could work at—and she wants nothing more than to <em>ruin my life</em> and… take you… away… from… me.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s voice peters out as she begins to realize how unhinged she sounds, a slowly deflating balloon.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>In the privacy of her own mind, these had all seemed like perfectly real and rational thoughts. Kayla from Missouri really <em>could</em> be a harlot and a red-lettered temptress sent by her dead mother’s accursed shade and the devil himself to rip what little happiness Agatha’s managed to claw from the world out of her grasp.</p><p> </p><p>Out loud? Well, there’s a reason Rio looks like Agatha’s decided to play a rousing game of Whack-a-Mole with her brainpan.</p><p> </p><p>“Agatha,” Rio starts, fingers flexing around Agatha’s side like she doesn’t quite know whether she should be pulling Agatha closer or trying to retreat. She swallows once, hard. The whites of her eyes have never appeared bigger or more obvious. It’s like catching sight of a deer that you’ll swerve into the guardrail to avoid hitting. “My love. I don’t know who this woman is. This, I swear to you. But I am going to block her riiiiiight now. Don’t you worry, sweetheart. Everything’s going to be fine.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha steps back, rubbing at her eyes with the heels of her hands. A frustrated noise escapes her.</p><p> </p><p>“Oh my God. I’m so sorry. You don’t—you don’t have to do that. I just heard myself, I know I sound crazy.”</p><p> </p><p>Before Rio, Agatha had never been the territorial type. (Then again, she’d also been deeply closeted for the first couple decades of her life and an “emotionally lukewarm” partner at best, according to the few women who’d initiated short flings with her throughout the years until circumstance had forced her back to Westview, where she’d promptly resigned herself to dying alone.)</p><p> </p><p>Now, though? Now Agatha wants to flay a total stranger alive for the nonexistent crime of daring to appreciate the sight of Rio dancing on TikTok. She’s losing her mind. No one likes crazy.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha presses down harder, until white pinpricks burst against the backs of her eyelids. Rio’s hands are on her in an instant, coaxing her hands away from her face. Still, Agatha doesn’t open her eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey.” Agatha can’t look at her. She won’t. Rio’s fingers, encircling Agatha’s wrists, give a light squeeze. “Come on, pretty girl. Let me see you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s resolve falters. There’s not a hint of reproach to be seen in Rio’s expression. Merely a fond and gut-wrenchingly earnest warmth. She leans in to press a gentle kiss to the tip of Agatha’s nose in reward.</p><p> </p><p>“There we go. Good girl.”</p><p> </p><p>“I know what you’re doing,” Agatha croaks. The sudden tightness in her throat from holding back tears is making her sound like a frog with a head cold. Unblinking, Rio stares back at her with guileless eyes.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah? And what’s that?”</p><p> </p><p>“You know I like it when—” Agatha can’t finish her sentence. She gnaws at her bottom lip, cheeks aflame.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands squeeze around her wrists again, prompting her to continue. “When?”</p><p> </p><p>“When you call me nice things,” Agatha admits, voice reduced to scarcely more than a broken whisper.</p><p> </p><p>“What else?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio closes the remaining distance between them. She coaxes Agatha into wrapping both arms around her neck as her own hands settle low on Agatha’s back. Agatha’s eyes briefly flutter shut before the insistent press of Rio’s palms urges her to open them again.</p><p> </p><p>“What, um, what do you mean?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio fully invades Agatha’s space, leaning in to whisper in her ear. The heat of her breath makes Agatha’s shiver. When she speaks, her voice spills against the shell of Agatha’s ear like sunlight, warming her down to the bone.</p><p> </p><p>“Am I doing anything else that you like right now?”</p><p> </p><p>“Everything,” Agatha breathes, heart hammering frantically in her chest. An F1 racer couldn’t outpace the desperate drumbeat echoing between her ribs. “I like everything you do to me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Good answer.” Rio’s hands move to her hips. She gives her a guiding push, easily walking Agatha backwards towards the bed. “I don’t care about any of those comments, baby. I don’t even read most of them. I’ll block whoever bothers you, okay?”</p><p> </p><p>“You don’t think I’m crazy?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio shrugs.</p><p> </p><p>“Crazy jealous, maybe. But I’ll let you in on a secret: I am, too.” Rio’s fingers grab the hem of her tank top and pull upwards. Agatha lets Rio undress her without protest, thoroughly enjoying the way that Rio’s pupils blow saucer-wide as more and more of Agatha’s skin is exposed to her hungering view. “I almost decked that guy at Costco the other day for looking at you too long.”</p><p> </p><p>Frowning, Agatha tries to wrack her brain for the memory. Nothing surfaces. She’s down to her panties now, which, to be frank, is a far more pressing concern.</p><p> </p><p>“What guy?”</p><p> </p><p>The pointed smile Rio levels in her direction is darkly triumphant.</p><p> </p><p>“Exactly. You didn’t even notice. Just like I don’t notice anyone else but you. No one matters to me except for you. Understand?”</p><p> </p><p>Oh.</p><p> </p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio slips a hand between them, finding the damp patch staining the cotton with unerring accuracy.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes,” Agatha groans, rough and needy, jerking into the touch.</p><p> </p><p>There’s no resistance as Rio shoves her onto the bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“I’d still like to make sure that the lesson sticks. Is that okay?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rises up on her elbows, nodding. A shaky breath punches its way out of her.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio advances with all the predatory grace of a large, deadly feline. She slides both hands beneath Agatha’s spread thighs, finding the bend of her knees and dragging her into position at the edge of the mattress.</p><p> </p><p>“Good girl.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>On Saturday, Agatha’s shuffling towards the end of the driveway to bring the garbage can and recycling bins back in when a familiar voice shatters the perfect stillness of the morning quiet.</p><p> </p><p>“Hi there, neighbor!”</p><p> </p><p>Groggy-eyed and wholly unprepared for the burden of human interaction, Agatha turns to face Sharon with a pasted-on smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Hey, Sharon. Good morning.” Huh, would you look at that: Agatha sounds about sixty percent less dead inside than usual. Well, a win is a win.</p><p> </p><p>“Those azaleas your girlfriend put in look amazing,” Sharon gushes. Her unfailing cheer doesn’t feel quite as grating as before, either. This is likely a result of the fact that Rio’s literally dead asleep in Agatha’s bed right now after a very, <em>very</em> eventful night. “What’s her secret?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha finds herself promising to ask without really thinking about it—and <em>meaning</em> it.</p><p> </p><p>Five minutes later, washing her hands back in the safety of her kitchen, Agatha’s thoughts drift, turning inward. Not for the first time, Agatha allows herself to ponder on the whole <em>Rio Effect</em>, as she’s come to privately consider it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Growing up, she’d never been a particularly happy or sociable child. More often than not, Agatha had preferred to keep her own company. With a mother like Evanora, who was prone to finding fault in whatever Agatha did—or didn’t—do, things were better that way. Señor Scratchy had been the first exception to her self-imposed solitude that she hadn’t eventually come to regret, but Agatha had mostly chalked that up to the fact that he was cute, fluffy, and unable to speak, which therefore made it impossible for him to say anything that would drive Agatha away.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, though? Agatha just… wants her.</p><p> </p><p>She wants to know her, to be around her, to always have her near.</p><p> </p><p>Agatha keeps waiting for the other shoe to drop, for Rio to get tired of her, or worse: for Agatha’s lifelong apathy to kick in and slowly make her indifferent to Rio’s presence in her life.</p><p> </p><p>But they’ve been together for months now, and Agatha’s cravings have only deepened over time.</p><p> </p><p>She’s never been so happy for so long before—in this house or otherwise. Agatha doesn’t know what to do with it all, and now that happiness is starting to leak into every other aspect of her life. Her cup runneth totally over, or however the saying goes.</p><p> </p><p>This level of change should be terrifying. It’s messy and unpredictable and obeys none of the usual rules of her world. According to the guidelines of the personal playbook that she’s always previously followed and trusted in, Agatha should be running away.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> Hell, she should be halfway to Missouri by now, if anything.</span></p><p> </p><p>Instead, she dries her hands on a nearby tea towel and goes to rifle around in the pantry in search of waffle ingredients.</p><p> </p><p><em>Rio</em>, she thinks, the voice in her head giving an uncharacteristically chipper and upbeat performance today, <em>will definitely enjoy that</em>.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“Come on.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>“Please?”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>“Agathaaaaaa.”</p><p> </p><p>“No.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio turns and flops backwards over the arm of the couch with an overly dramatic sigh. Even upside-down, the pleading expression on her face is devastating. Agatha crosses her arms, shifting in place.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It’s a ridiculous idea. Agatha’s over her misdirected jealousy now, she doesn’t need to prove anything to anyone. Rio’s hers, and all the random thirst comments in the world won’t do jack shit to change that, even if the audacity of certain (unblocked, because Agatha’s capable of being the bigger person) individuals still rubs her the wrong way on occasion.</p><p> </p><p>But ever since the night of Agatha’s largely unwarranted meltdown, Rio’s passing fixation on showing Agatha off to the world has returned—with a vengeance.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay, forget the video,” Rio tries, still draped awkwardly over the couch with the top of her head smushed against the cushions. “What about a picture? On Instagram? I won’t even tag you.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes. “Which picture?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio pops back up like a demented Jack-in-the-box, sans creepy music. She hurries over to where Agatha stands, holding out her phone and grinning like a loon.</p><p> </p><p>“This one.”</p><p> </p><p>It’s a candid shot from <em>Posers</em>, a grungy out-of-the-way coffee shop run by Rio’s friend Yelena. Agatha’s been pictured in profile, face turned towards the side as she looks off into the distance. She’s really only visible from the chest up, dressed in one of her favorite white blouses and wearing her hair down. A steaming cup of coffee and a plate of dark chocolate biscotti sit on the table in front of her. Objectively, it’s one of the best photos that Agatha’s ever seen of herself.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>It’s also one of the most vulnerable photos that she’s ever seen of herself. The expression on her face is soft, open, entirely unguarded in the way she only ever is when she’s with Rio. Defenses down, unreserved and unhidden. Is Agatha really ready to be perceived that way by thousands upon thousands of virtual strangers?</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s gaze flicks upwards. Rio’s brow is furrowed, bottom lip caught between her teeth as she waits for a response with bated breath. The look in Rio’s eyes is what convinces her. It tells her that Rio will listen to whatever she says, that she’ll follow Agatha’s lead in this. No matter how much she likes to poke and prod and teasingly push for Agatha’s acquiescence in going public with their relationship, Rio will always respect her final word.</p><p> </p><p>“Okay. You can post that one photo for now. The video idea we’re tabling for later discussion. It’s not a ‘yes,’ but it’s not a total ‘no’ yet either.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio positively beams.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Despite her best efforts to beg off, Agatha ends up joining Rio for dinner with her friends: Alice, Billy, and—weirdly—Lilia. Agatha’s kooky, shawl-wearing, tarot-loving boss.</p><p> </p><p>“You said she was just your friend’s godmother,” Agatha hisses as they make their way up the driveway after parking along the street. “So why is she here?”</p><p> </p><p>Rio breezily waves off her concerns.</p><p> </p><p>“Lilia’s always been super chill, babe. Trust me, whatever she’s like at work, she’s way less buttoned up outside of the office.”</p><p> </p><p>“That’s exactly what I’m afraid of,” Agatha mutters darkly to herself.</p><p> </p><p>“Huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Never mind.”</p><p> </p><p>Dinner, shockingly, goes off without a hitch.</p><p> </p><p>Against all logic, Lilia’s marginally saner after downing a couple glasses of wine. Alice, while not much of a talker, proves to be extremely witty and acerbic in a way that allows her and Agatha to get along like a house on fire. Billy… Well, he’s enthusiastic, Agatha’ll give him that. (He grows on her after a few drinks. Sort of like moss, if moss could be the kind of brainy, guyliner-wearing twink that English and Arts Department teachers likely love having in their classes.)</p><p> </p><p>By the time they get home—which, for tonight, is Rio’s—Agatha’s mind is only on one thing. Luckily, Rio’s thoughts have taken the same turn.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>Agatha sinks down into Rio’s lap, mouth dropping open as she carefully takes the ruthlessly thick green strap inside herself, inch by delicious inch. She’s moaning at a volume that might otherwise be embarrassing if she wasn’t already delirious with want. Rio’s hips rock upwards in shallow thrusts, rutting into Agatha with agonizing slowness and control.</p><p> </p><p>“That’s it,” Rio murmurs against Agatha’s pounding pulse point, alternating between soft kisses and sharp nips with her teeth. “You take me so, <em>so</em> well, sweetheart.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mmm,” Agatha hums, tilting her head back to allow Rio easier access to her neck and collarbones as she finally—<em>finally</em>—manages to welcome the toy in to the hilt. The sweet stretch, the impossible fullness, makes her cry out and grind down harder. This, in turn, leaves Rio groaning wordlessly into the hollow of her throat. Action, reaction. A beautifully reciprocal pattern of desire establishing itself, setting them both ablaze. “<em>Yes</em>.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio noses her way up to croon against Agatha’s tightly clenching jaw. “Come on, baby. Take it. Use me.”</p><p> </p><p>Oh, <em>fuck</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s hands tighten on Agatha’s hips, urging her to move, to fuck herself in earnest on Rio’s glorious cock. It’s dizzyingly addictive—the smooth slide, the delectable stretch, the perfect pressure. Agatha’s eyes flutter shut as waves of pleasure crackle through her, burning hot and wild beneath her skin. The beginnings of a plaintive whine form low in Agatha’s chest as she complies with Rio’s fervently given command, bouncing up and down on her lap like a woman possessed. She can feel herself dripping around Rio’s cock as it buries itself between her thighs, splitting her wide and oh so deliciously open. The building sound loudly rips itself free from her lips the instant that one of Rio’s hands drifts down to the slick, wet heat of her so that Rio can start rubbing as Agatha’s clit as she moves.</p><p> </p><p>“Rio, <em>please</em>.” She begs, low and breathless and yearning. Only one arm remains braced around Rio’s shoulders as the fingers of Agatha’s free hand tangle themselves in Rio’s hair. Agatha’s barely coherent enough to know what she’s specifically trying to ask for. All she wants is <em>more</em>.</p><p> </p><p>“Be a good girl and come for me, Agatha,” Rio replies. Then Rio’s fingers begin drawing tight, rapid circles around Agatha’s clit as she continues to ride Rio at a merciless, mutually destructive pace. Rio moves with her, endlessly giving, and Agatha willingly accepts everything her partner offers. She’s balancing on the knife’s edge of total surrender, a step away from collapsing into the blissful oblivion of release. Back arched, spine tight, white-hot tension curling low in her belly, inching closer and closer to igniting a ruinous explosion. “Come on, pretty girl. Let me hear you. Take what you need.”</p><p> </p><p>And Agatha does, falling apart with ragged, gasping whimper. Rio continues to gently toy with Agatha’s clit as she comes, easing her down from the sharp, electric height of her pleasure and into a gentle, sun-warmed satisfaction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>“So good. You did so <em>good</em> for me, sweetheart.” Rio whispers hotly against Agatha’s sweat-slick skin as she shudders and moans through the aftershocks. “You’re perfect. Thank you.”</p><p> </p><p>She doesn’t stop until Agatha slumps bonelessly against her, trembling and dazed.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>On Agatha’s birthday—which happens to fall on Halloween—Rio wakes her up with breakfast in bed. This includes skull-shaped pancakes, crispy bacon bats, and a bouquet of dark flowers that Agatha recognizes from Rio’s greenhouse.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p><p> </p><p>Also: party hats.</p><p> </p><p>Dumb, dorky, decorated cones with ribbons for chin straps, clearly handmade with painstaking care. Rio’s already wearing the one covered in spiderwebs, complete with a terrifyingly realistic figure of a tarantula crawling up the left side. The one she’s excitedly waving in Agatha’s face features a hand-painted portrait of Señor Scratchy riding a broomstick across the star-filled night sky, backlit by a gleaming yellow moon.</p><p> </p><p>“Marry me,” Agatha says without thinking, aching heart filled to bursting in her chest.</p><p> </p><p>They both freeze.</p><p> </p><p>Rio, in her ridiculous hat, rears back and does a comical double-take. The fake tarantula trembles.</p><p> </p><p>“Come again?”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s never been the sentimental type.</p><p> </p><p>Overpriced cards and cumbersome decorations and cheesy, gimmicky, over-the-top celebrations of made-up holidays fueled by capitalistic overconsumption have, historically, done nothing but annoy Agatha to no end. If the Grinch had a sister, Agatha would be one of the terrors of Whoville. Having her birthday on Halloween has generally been a source of annoyance. People either remembered it after the fact and offered unnecessary apologies, or handed her a bar of variety pack chocolate and sent her on her way. Evanora, certainly, had never found a reason to celebrate her only daughter’s entrance into the world.</p><p> </p><p>Something like this had never happened to her before, and Agatha had been woefully unprepared to just how deeply, unstoppably, unquestionably in love such a gesture would make her feel. Especially coming from Rio. Agatha takes stock of herself for a moment, digging into the depths of the squishy organ currently taking up far too much real estate in the middle of her ribcage. She asks it a question and waits for an answer.</p><p> </p><p>When she finds it, Agatha doubles down.</p><p> </p><p>“Will you marry me, Rio?”</p><p> </p><p>For a long moment, Rio blinks at her in stunned silence. Then she reaches out and sticks the party hat on top of Agatha’s head. Rio’s face breaks into a ecstatic grin as Agatha obligingly leans forward in order to allow her to tie the ribbons under her chin.</p><p> </p><p>“Yes, Agatha,” she finally replies, eyes twinkling merrily. “I’d love to marry you. Happy birthday, mi amor.”</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>They formally tie the knot in May, holding an outdoor handfasting ceremony attended by an intimate gathering of their closest friends and family.</p><p> </p><p>Lilia officiates, and Señor Scratchy hops down the aisle with the rings in a pouch affixed to the back of his tiny custom tuxedo. In a flowing dress the color of violets, Agatha follows him to where Rio waits at the altar in a three-piece emerald suit, smiling so widely and for so long that her cheeks burn all evening after.</p><p> </p><hr/><p> </p><p>“This is all your fault,” Agatha huffs, glaring down at Rio’s kneeling figure.</p><p> </p><p>A wry smile pulls at the corners of Rio’s mouth as she finishes lacing Agatha’s left shoe.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course, my love,” she agrees uncomplainingly, leaning forward to give the curve of Agatha’s giant belly a kiss before reaching for Agatha’s socked but otherwise shoeless right foot. “And I’m very sorry about that.”</p><p> </p><p>“I was a small baby. Scrawny. A runt, if you will. There are pictures. Lots and lots of photographic evidence exists to prove it.” Agatha sniffs, tossing her head and adjusting the fabric of her purple sundress to lie just right across her stomach. At this point, Agatha only bothers with pants when forced—which is never. “So this has <em>got</em> to be all you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Mhm. I’m sure.” Finished with her task, Rio gives Agatha’s knees an indulgent pat. “You’re all set, mi vida. Let me help you up.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha’s shuffle from the mudroom to the driveway takes about a million years. She’s seen viral videos of sloths crossing roads at faster speeds than she can currently manage. By the time she’s settled into the passenger seat of the car, she’s panting a bit. <em>And</em> little Nicky’s gotten restless. Great. She rubs at her stomach, hoping to soothe him out of playing kickball with anything important. Lately, it feels more and more like she’s growing a future soccer player in there. That, or one hell of a future martial artist.</p><p> </p><p>“We don’t have to stay long, right?”</p><p> </p><p>In the rearview mirror, the corners of Rio’s eyes crinkle cutely as their gazes meet.</p><p> </p><p>“Right. We can leave as soon as you want.” In a carefully cajoling tone, Rio adds, “It’s only your baby shower.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. Fine. Maybe she shouldn’t have pushed it back until this late in the game.</p><p> </p><p>“One hour.”</p><p> </p><p>“Make it two, and I’ll give you a foot rub as soon as we get home.”</p><p> </p><p>Her biggest newfound weakness. Rio’s been playing <em>so</em> dirty as of late. Agatha decides to return the favor. She fully turns her face towards Rio, batting her lashes and pouting. Even though she personally can’t see it, Rio’s been swearing up and down that Agatha’s pregnancy has left her glowing like the sun. This particular development has been doing diabolical things to both of their already high libidos.</p><p> </p><p>“An hour and a half,” Agatha bargains, baring her teeth in a coy, winning smile. “And maybe I won’t be too tired to ride you later tonight.”</p><p> </p><p>Rio’s eyes lose almost every trace of their usual honeyed brown.</p><p> </p><p>“Done.”</p><p> </p><p>Agatha gloats.</p><p> </p><p>“You are <em>such</em> a soft touch.”</p><p> </p><p>With a laugh, Rio puts the car into reverse and starts backing down the driveway.</p><p> </p><p>“For you, amor? Always.”</p><p> </p>
