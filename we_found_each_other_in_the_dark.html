<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Rio Vidal loved Halloween. As a kid she had the wackiest ideas for her costumes, unfortunately for her parents, it was never just something they could get off the rack. One year she wanted to be a cheese grater, the next a pile of washing, the next a melting ice cream. Yes, she was…different, but luckily she had parents who somehow always managed to make it work, even when no one had any idea of how to make a six year old look like a plate of hors d'oeuvres. As she got older, the costumes also grew up, some were funny puns, some were political statements, and depending on the host and the potential guests, and some were down right slutty. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She graduated from Penn State the year before, and with some dumb luck she landed her first job at </span>
<em>
<span>Green Acres Landscape Architects </span>
</em>
<span>as a junior architect. Fuck knows how she did that, but she was grateful, she was doing what she loved and finally making a living on her own. Plus being a woman with a decent salary did help with her personal life, she had a great apartment close to her office and all her favorite after hour hang out spots and she could impress her dates with lavish evenings around town. Rio believed her life motto to be “</span>
<em>
<span>Carpe Noctem”,</span>
</em>
<span> because seizing the night was way more exciting than seizing the day.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>October proved to be a difficult month at work. You wouldn't think that fall was a busy season in the landscaping business, but they had some maintenance projects and one particular big project they were preparing to start kick off as soon as spring came around. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Even though she was up to her elbows in design proposals, Rio was still determined to enjoy her favorite day of the year, Halloween. This year she planned something more traditional for Halloween. She barely had time to think about something that would be a hit at the party, let alone get creative and make something to wear from scratch. But with a little bit of effort, she did manage to steal some time after work to put together an outfit that didn’t scream </span>
<em>
<span>last minute costume, </span>
</em>
<span>putting extra thought in some details of the costume to make her stand out in more ways than one. If she was going to be something more “traditional” like a witch, she was going to be </span>
<em>
<span>the hottest</span>
</em>
<span> witch at the party. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>This year’s invitation came from Natasha Romanoff, Rio’s one-night-stand turned best friend since college. After way too many drinks in their first year, they hooked up and when it was over, they both knew that they enjoyed the drinks and the partying together more than what followed. Plus, navigating anything relating to sex proved very difficult when both fought to top each other the whole time. What was the saying, “</span>
<em>
<span>Two tops does not a bottom make”...</span>
</em>
<span> Instead they had more in common as friends. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just before graduation last year Natasha became infatuated with Wanda, was it the eastern European accent or their shared love for bright red hair, Rio wasn’t sure, but all Nat could talk about was her unrequited love for the girl. Rio wasn’t really interested in getting to know Nat’s latest crush, honestly the girl looked far too straight and had this Stepford Wife aura that unsettled Rio. But Rio could never resist a Halloween party. Even if the party was just a ruse for Nat to get to invite Wanda and test the waters.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever…” Rio sighed, she had a smoking hot costume planned down to the hair, makeup and character backstory, and while she finished getting dressed, securing the green hot glue gun crown on her forehead, she couldn’t help but feel a little excited about the party. She looked hot and she was ready to have a great evening. She hoped that Nat had the decency to invite someone interesting for her too, if not, their local queer bar around the corner will have to do. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agnes’s POV</em>
</b>
<span>   </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes O’Connor hated parties. Especially themed parties with people she barely knew, and tonight was no different. She prided herself on her academic focus and that is exactly what she needed to graduate at the top of her class next year when she finished her PHD in History. She loved history, her current term paper was focused on Women's’ and Gender Studies relating to the 15th and 16th Century. She had to explain the concept to Wanda and Jen, her roommates, for probably the tenth time. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It's simple Wanda, the Witch Trials were some of the best recorded examples of how misogyny and sexism were used to prejudice and prosecute women. Sure we’re not flying around on brooms today, but around the world women are still being seen as second rate citizens in even the most modern countries of the world. Just because we are living in the 21st century doesn’t mean it got better for all our gals.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes could talk about this for hours, was it a bit of a bummer in some social circles, sure, but Agnes didn’t care. Having passion for something you cared about was more important than being invited to the next major event. Unfortunately for her, she didn’t have that luxury tonight because in order to prove to Wanda and Jen that she wasn’t a bummer and a prude, she promised them that she will to go to one fucking party with them. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It was their last year living together as roommates and they all agreed to make the most of it. Wanda was finishing her Criminal Law degree and filling Agnes’s open spot at her mother’s firm, and Jen was starting her medical internship at Northwestern soon. Agnes planned to stay on and finish her PHD despite her mother’s disappointing looks at the dinner table. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Since Agnes changed her major from Law to History she hasn’t had the best relationship with her mother. Her mother planned on her joining the O’Connor-Calderu Criminal Law Firm once she graduated. Agnes used up every bit of courage she had and finally stood up to her mother and changed her major to something she was really passionate about. Lilia Calderu, her mother’s law firm partner and childhood friend was like Agnes’s second parent, and when Agnes decided to confront her mother, Lilia was there to soften the blow and pick up the pieces afterwards.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>So there she was, standing in their shared living room dressed in her DIY costume of Anne Hathaway, Shakespeare's wife, not Princess Diaries thank you very much. Jen entered the room and stopped in her tracks as she looked Agnes up and down. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ag, what the fuck? The invitation said it was a </span>
<em>
<span>sexy</span>
</em>
<span> Halloween party, what about this old woman drag says sexy?” Jen said, almost offended. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m Anne Hathaway, Shakespeare’s wife…” Without Agnes getting another word in, Jen ripped off part of the skirt and cut her blouse open in the front to open up her cleavage. “There, I guess you are Shakespeare's slutty wife now.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes probably looked better, but now she felt a little self conscious. She’s never been the if-you-have-it-flaunt-it type, but it has been a while since she hooked up with anyone and tonight’s party guests would probably not be the usual crowds she mingled with who would appreciate the attention to detail of her apparent  “unsexy” Anne Hathaway costume. So she accepted her fate and followed her roommates to the uber waiting outside.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When they walked into the apartment she was overwhelmed with the loud music and party guests already dancing and drinking. Taking in the costumes of the people around her, she agreed that Jen was right, her earlier costume would not have been appropriate. The host of the party approached them with a tray of shots. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda, Jen, glad you could join,” the woman said, not really paying attention to Jen or Agnes, her eyes were fixed on Wanda and her skin tight red leotard outfit. “And who are you dressed as, gorgeous?” the woman asked Wanda, to which Wanda replied “I’m the Scarlet Witch, from the comics?” The woman’s eyes lingered on Wanda before she handed each of them a small cup of god knows what and introduced herself as Natasha. Jen took the shot and turned to Agnes to whisper “If you have any good sense, you’ll get out of her way, they’re going to eye fuck until Wanda finally gives in and no one wants to be close when that happens.” And before Agnes could reply Jen disappeared into the crowd on the dancefloor.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Next to her Natasha and Wanda were still very much in their own bubble and Agnes took that as her cue to leave. She headed towards the patio to escape the crowd and to get some fresh air, this was going to be a long night.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Being fashionably late was Rio’s forte, sure it could be seen as bad manners in some circles, but a </span>
<em>
<span>sexy</span>
</em>
<span> Halloween party surely lacked the decorum required to enforce any such social rules. Rio arrived just past 10pm, just in time for all of the boring people to have left and the ones who couldn’t handle their alcohol to have passed out somewhere.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She stepped into the party like she owned the place. Some girls stared in awe and some glared, she would avoid the latter she thought. Being a “Heartless Bitch” as her previous hook up screamed at her, certainly had its challenges, especially when the dating pool around the campus was drying up with women who hadn’t heard of her preceding reputation, “lick-em-and-leave-em” was Rio’s favorite accusation, she had it printed on a t-shirt and proudly wore it to campus the next week.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scanned the apartment to see if she could find her friends, only to see Nat and Wanda sitting in a corner in deep conversation, Nat was clearly fighting every urge in her body to not jump Wanda’s bones. “Nope…” she mumbled to herself, looking to the other corner of the apartment, where she spotted the kitchen table lined with drinks. She’d start there. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked over to the dining table to grab a cup of whatever Pinterest punch Nat had mixed and leaned against the table. She needed to warm up soon otherwise tonight would end up being a dud and she felt too good to have that happen. She recognized one of Wanda’s friends on the patio talking to an unfamiliar girl dressed in the most hideous slutty old lady costume Rio has ever seen. She laughed at the audacity and downed her drink and poured another before walking over to join their conversation.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, well, well, if it isn’t Jane Parsley in the flesh?” Rio said as she sauntered over to the two women. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen stopped talking mid sentence and rolled her eyes as she turned to Rio. “Rio, here to break another innocent heart? The night is still young.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, “Oh Jane, you wound me.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s Jen Kale, you insufferable asshole. Why don’t you fuck off? Me and Agnes here are not interested in whatever drama you plan on causing tonight.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, Kale, the worst kind of vegetable” Rio said with a smirk, causing the woman with Jen to spit out her drink and laughed. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry Jen” the woman whispered as Jen glared at her for laughing. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen Jen, I’m sorry,” Rio said, “I promise I am not here to cause trouble, you know how I get on Halloween, it’s the most wonderful time of the year!”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Isn’t that Christmas?” Agnes asked.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Honey no, Halloween is much better, plus everyone gets to dress up, not just your fat drunk uncle trying to score some spiked milk and cookies. This is much more fun.” Rio said, letting her eyes trace over the woman’s costume, landing on the cut open blouse. “And it is not everyday a babe like you dresses up as a sexy Anne Hathaway either, unless…”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you know?” Agnes asked excitedly, as Jen rolled her eyes and left mumbling something like “</span>
<em>
<span>Here we fucking go again…</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled a crooked smile and leaned closer to Agnes “What can I say? I appreciate literature as much as the next broody lesbian… but also, you literally have it written on that sticker on your costume, so I only needed basic reading skills to figure this one out.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes glanced down at the sticker and her face turned a shade of red. “Of course. And what are you supposed to be? A slutty green demon?” she asked Rio, to which Rio replied, “No I am a green witch, specifically </span>
<em>
<span>The Green Witch” </span>
</em>
<span>she said, lowering her voice in a growl when she said the last part.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>This seemed to spark some recognition in Agnes as her eyes lit up a bit and Rio had to steady herself as she noticed the bright blue eyes staring back at her. Whoever this Agnes was, she was beautiful. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You know about the Green Witch?” Agnes asked, surprised.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agnes’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes stared at Rio, she was gorgeous and her costume stirred something in Agnes that she felt too unfamiliar with. Jen definitely seemed to hate this woman’s guts, but Agnes felt drawn to her for some reason. Sure she knew of her reputation, Jen complained about her enough, saying that this </span>
<em>
<span>Rio girl</span>
</em>
<span> kept stealing all her dates, but talking to Rio now, she didn’t see the Casanova everybody warned about. Something about Rio intrigued her, like they’ve known each other in a previous life. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>That didn’t mean that Agnes wasn’t aware that if given the chance Rio would still eat her up and spit her out, she wasn’t that delusional, but after all the drinks she’s had tonight, she felt a strange sense of confidence, and for whatever reason, Rio was interested enough to keep talking to her.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You know about the Green Witch?” Agnes asked, surprised.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well yes,” Rio started to explain. “I’ve always loved Halloween, and consequently witches and Halloween go hand in hand, and I really love plants and isn’t that like her whole thing? Earth magic and all that…” Rio took a sip of her drink and Agnes swore she saw Rio’s bad girl facade slip for a split second. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes and Rio stayed on the patio talking for a while when Jen, Wanda and Nat walked over to join them. Agnes was laughing at something Rio was saying, not really paying attention to the three other women who stood staring at the two of them. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s so funny?” Jen asked. Agnes suddenly realised most of the party guests had left already leaving a small group inside and the five of them outside on the patio. Had she and Rio talked the whole night?</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face turned colder as she turned to Jen. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Girls…” Nat warned. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes watched as Rio gave her a trained fake smile. She turned back to Agnes “What would you say if we ditched this joint? I know a place around the corner that stays open super late and they have the best ice cream in town. I am dying for a salted caramel cone.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes looked at Wanda, Nat and Jen who stared at the two of them like they were aliens. She looked at Rio, a genuine smile on her face, seemingly harmless and she swallowed hard before answering softly. “Okay, that actually sounds great.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen and Wanda blinked at Agnes and she gave them a simple wave. “I’ll see you two tomorrow.” she said following Rio out of the apartment. She had no clue what she was doing, but there was an undeniable pull she didn’t have the strength to fight, and when was the last time she allowed herself to have salted caramel ice cream after midnight?</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was not going to lie, she was shocked when she realized that she and Agnes spent almost two hours just talking, as if they‘ve known each other for ages. Agnes was funny and smart, and Rio noticed small things she would do while she talked, like scrunching up her nose or when she laughed she sometimes had this cute little snort… and oh my god what the fuck was happening? Was she starting to feel something for this woman after only two hours?</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio realized she was being too quiet when Agnes suddenly asked her where they were heading. “Oh uhm, it’s just here around the corner actually.” Rio said, pointing in the general direction of where the ice cream stand normally stood.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they reached it, she turned to Agnes. “So what would you like?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes thought for a second and smiled, “What would you recommend?” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Like I said earlier, the salted caramel is my favorite.” Rio answered.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, I’ll get that then.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio placed their order and waited for the man to hand her the two cones. “My lady,” Rio joked, bowing as she handed the cone to Agnes.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, a gentleman.” Agnes joked back as she took the cone from Rio. Agnes tasted the ice cream and moaned. Rio’s eyes snapped open at the sound. “This is amazing, Rio,” Agnes said as she licked the top of the ice cream. Rio swore her mouth started watering, she blamed it on the ice cream.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s good isn’t it?” She said, trying to hide whatever this was she was feeling.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They sat at the fold up table and chairs in front of the ice cream stand and silently enjoyed the rest of their ice cream. Rio tried her best to not stare at Agnes, but the licking and the lingering alcohol in her veins were making it extremely hard for her not to.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing after this?” Rio asked suddenly. She had no idea where that came from but she couldn’t stop it either.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes scrunched her face as she continued to lick at her ice cream. “What do you mean, it’s past midnight?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, “Yes I know, I mean like, are you going home or back to Nat’s or…”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Or with you?” Agnes asked, lifting a brow.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was sure her face was as red as the traffic light hanging over her head. “No, well. I mean you can, of course. I just meant…. Do you need a ride? We can share an uber or something?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes laughed and Rio had to fight the urge to record its sound to listen to it again later. “I’m that way,” Agnes pointed.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m this way” Rio pointed in the other direction, and Rio saw Agnes’s face fall for the first time that evening, she needed to correct that immediately, “Okay, I want to make sure you get home safe, so let's take an uber to yours and then I will get one back to my place.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you… are you sure? It’s completely out of your way? And what if I want to make sure you get home safe?” Agnes asked.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio scoffed “Please, I am older and wiser and I know how to punch someone. I will be fine.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes’s eyes narrowed. “Fine, but only if I can get your number.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was sure she was smiling like an idiot, but she didn’t hesitate one bit when she reached to take Agnes’s phone to insert her contact information.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They ordered the uber and headed to Agnes’s house. Rio smiled as Agnes took her hand and held it till they came to a stop.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mind if I text you?” Agnes asked before she climbed out of the car.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please do?” Rio smiled and watched as Agnes stood waving as the car pulled away. Rio’s heart pounded in her chest. This wasn’t like any other Halloween she ever had, but she felt like it was one of the best nights of her life.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agnes’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes stood on the curb watching the uber disappear with Rio in it. She had the best night, and she felt giddy thinking about getting Rio’s number and couldn’t wait to send her a text. Now would be too soon, she thought. She decided that maybe tomorrow morning will be better. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to walk to the entrance of the apartment building, almost floating in a haze as she thought back to the few hours she spent with Rio, when she heard screaming coming from the alley next to the building. Normally, Agnes wouldn’t insert herself into dangerous situations, but she couldn’t stop her feet from taking her to where the screaming was coming from. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She stood with her back against the wall and carefully turned her neck to be able to peek around the corner. What she didn’t know was that the next few minutes of her life would change everything. Agnes peeked around the corner and saw two men with their hands tied behind their backs kneeled in front of two gunmen who had their guns pointed at their heads. Another man stood next to them, clearly the leader of the pack.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ralph,” the one man on his knees pleaded. “I promise you man, it wasn’t us who told the cops…”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, Mr. Bohner,” the other joined in, “We would never tell about the drugs,”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up, shut up, shut </span>
<em>
<span>up</span>
</em>
<span>!” the man, Ralph, screamed at them. “There is no way the cops would know about the Cargo City warehouse, and thanks to you two idiots, they raided the place and I’m out about $24 million in snow.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mr. Bohner, please...” the man pleaded again.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Jeffrey, Herb, I’m done here.” Ralph said and indicated something to the two men.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly gun shots went off and Agnes screamed running away to hide as she saw the guy, Ralph, look up towards her direction.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes ran into the building and locked the door behind her, peeking through the mail hatch. She saw the two goons run around looking for her and when they ran down the street away from her she ran up the stairs and into her apartment, frantically locking the doors with shaky hands. What did she just witness? What has she gotten herself into?</span>

<em>Agnes’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes barely slept, every small noise woke her up. Thoughts of the men finding her apartment and finding her kept her awake all night. When morning came she was still shaking. Jen and Wanda hadn’t come home yet, and suddenly her apartment felt too small and she had the worst feeling that she wasn’t safe with the information she had about what she had seen last night.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Deciding that she needed to leave and clear her head, she packed a small overnight bag with some essentials and sent a message on their group chat to Wanda and Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to stay at my mother’s for the rest of the weekend.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She called a cab and put on her best disguise, a cap, hooded sweater and sunglasses will have to do for now. She didn’t want anyone to recognize her. She walked down the stairs to the foyer of the building and hid behind the door while she waited for the cab to arrive. When it did she carefully opened the door and ran to the waiting cab, gave the man the address and shrunk into the back seat to hide herself as they drove off.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When they reached her mother’s house, she removed her disguise and walked into the house, not her favorite place to be but for now, but she figured it would be a safer place to be while she figures out what she needed to do.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She was home alone, and sat in the living room, watching some brain dead reality show, when the channel changed to the local news channel. Probably some stupid setting her mother had on the TV to alert her of possible new clients on the news. She saw the familiar building in the background of the news reporter’s frame.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The public is urged to come forward with any information regarding last night’s double murder…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuckfuckfuckfuck, </span>
</em>
<span>Agnes thought. She definitely had information, she saw everything happen and she still remembers all three of the men’s names. But what if they came for her, or Wanda and Jen… </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly their group chat came alive.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wanda: “Those two men were shot next to </span>
</em>
<span>our</span>
<em>
<span> fucking apartment!”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen: “I just saw on the news, scary shit, hope you are both safe.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wanda: “I’m going to stay at Pietro’s for the rest of the week until this blows over. Jen, Ags, I think you shouldn’t stay at the apartment. Ag, stay with your mom okay. Jen, where will you go?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen: “Uhm… I guess I could go to my parents.”</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Wanda: “Okay, I’m leaving now. Please be safe girls!”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agnes: “I’ll stay here. Please let me know when you two are safe.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes bit at her nails. She had to do something, but knowing her mother, she couldn’t go to her, she defended guys like these, she probably even knew them. She had to figure something out, she couldn’t live with this secret eating at her.</span>
</p><p>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched the news on the gym’s TV in front of her, not really concentrating while she ran on the treadmill. She saw the news of the double murder, not recognizing anything particular about it and jumped off the treadmill wiping away the sweat off her forehead. She checked her phone again. Rio really hoped to have gotten a text from Agnes, but nothing yet. She could have kicked herself that she didn’t also get her number but she thought she would give the girl time. It was still early and she didn’t want to push too hard. If need be, she could just ask Jen or she could ask Natasha to ask Wanda… fuck, this was high school all over.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She hoped to hear from Agnes soon, in the meantime she would distract herself at the gym.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agnes’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dinner with her mother was always an event she dreaded, but given the circumstances she bit her tongue at every snide remark as they discussed her term paper and final year ahead at Penn State.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know it doesn’t sound as glamorous as criminal law, mother, but I love it. And I am doing very well. Dean Smith says that there might be a staff position available for me next year if I keep my grades up, and that actually sounds perfect. I can build my own curriculum and teach, what more would I want?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know Agnes, it seems like a waste. You are too smart to be… </span>
<em>
<span>staff.” </span>
</em>
<span>Evanora said snidely.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes took the hidden compliment as a small win and finished the rest of her dinner in silence.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lying in her childhood bed didn’t bring the safety she wished it had, she woke up from nightmares every few minutes. This continued into the next night. She had to go to the police, she couldn’t do this anymore. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The day before, she watched the news again in hopes that there may have been another lead or something, but the police had nothing and were still in the dark. Has no one else come forward yet? Agnes wrote down the anonymous tip line number and sat with the number dialed in her hands. She just had to press the call button…</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Without thinking too long about it she pressed the call button and heard the phone ring.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“PPD tip line, how may I help?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes hesitated…</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello?” the voice answered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“H-hi I have some information…” she finally spoke. Her hands were shaking and her heart was pounding.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ma’am, are you in a safe space to talk?” the woman asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Y-yeah, I… it's about the shooting. The one near campus.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please hold…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes thought about dropping the call, when another voice sounded over the phone. “Hi ma’am, this is Detective Jones, I understand you have some information about the campus shooting?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes answered “Yes” and proceeded to give the Detective every bit of information she had. Even the names of the men she overheard at the scene, the name she heard about the warehouse, everything she knew. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>In an hour the detective and some other police officers were at her mother’s home. Thank fuck her mother was out for the day.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ma’am for your protection I will need to move you to a safe house. If they saw you, they will be out looking for you. You will not be safe at your apartment.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t I just stay here?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“If you are willing to testify at the trial, we can't risk them knowing about you. We will keep you safe until the trial is over, it will be for your own safety and that of your friends and family.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A week passed since Halloween night, and Agnes still hasn’t sent Rio a text and she started feeling like she had been played. “</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck that chick, there are more where she came from” </span>
</em>
<span>she thought as she sat in Nat’s apartment nursing beer when Nat plopped down on the couch next to her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So? What are we getting up to tonight?” Nat asked.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>”I need to get drunk, so whatever you want to do, I’m doing that.” Rio said, taking a long sip of her beer. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*****</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat across from Nat at their regular bar, staring at the drink in front of her. She couldn’t shake the gnawing feeling of irritation or disappointment that Agnes never texted her. They didn’t even hook up and now she was hung up on her. She wasn’t even her type, she was beautiful yes, funny for sure, a bookworm, a mouthy feminist and not all as outgoing as the girls she usually sought out. Why did she have such a fucking hold on her?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rioooo?” Nat yelled, knocking her out of her inner thoughts. “Am I talking to myself tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry Nat, I’m just in my head tonight….” Rio shook her head and downed the last of her beer. “Another round?” She asked as she stood up.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, sure, you’re buying…” Nat replied.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ordered them another round at the bar and walked back to their table. She had to talk to Nat, if only to get Agnes off her mind. “So,” she tried “How are things with Miss Wanda?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nat sighed, “Honestly, it’s very frustrating, I keep getting mixed signals. One day we’re flirting like crazy and I think yeah this is happening and then then next day it’s like we’re both in a knitting circle struggling with small talk, like, </span>
<em>
<span>how’s your grandson doing, Mary?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed at Nat’s old lady voice “Yeah, that’ll confuse me too. Have you tried telling her you like her?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, am I not obvious enough? I only spoke to her at the party last week and we text and call each other the whole time. Apart from yelling </span>
<em>
<span>Wanda I fucking like you,</span>
</em>
<span> I think I’m pretty obvious.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe she doesn’t know, maybe she thinks since you flirt with almost everyone, including the furniture, that this is just what you do, you know. Maybe you need to be more forward, like actually ask her on a fucking date.” Rio suggested.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You might be right, Rio…” Nat considered Rio for a few seconds, “But what’s been up with you the last week, I mean here we are, alpha predators at our watering hole, and you haven’t even attempted to hit on someone, and let me tell you, blondie over there has been eyeing you since we sat down.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to look in the direction Nat was pointing at and saw a very attractive blond girl staring at her. She waved and turned back. “I don’t know Nat, I’m… tired I guess.” Rio didn’t want to bring up Agnes, tonight was about getting her out of her head, and she hasn’t succeeded for even one minute.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Something is up, you’re quiet, and almost… timid. It’s starting to freak me out actually. You’re not… dying are you?” Nat asked, feigning concern.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio blew out some air and laughed, “No… it’s just…” Rio rolled her eyes, maybe it would help to ask, Nat knew Wanda and Wanda knew Agnes, maybe they talked… “So you remember Wanda’s friend Agnes?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t tell me you hooked up with slutty grandma?” Nat asked curiously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No we didn’t, and she wasn’t slutty grandma. She was slutty Anne Hathaway.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Like the actress? I don’t see it…” Nat looked confused.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, Shakespeare’s wife, Anne Hathaway…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Who?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Never mind… anyway. So the night of the party we talked, a lot actually, and then we went for ice cream afterwards, you remember. Then I went home with her and gave her my number and its been like almost eight days and nothing, not even a </span>
<em>
<span>hey thanks for the salted caramel, please leave me alone forever. </span>
</em>
<span>Like nothing.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re butt hurt over a librarian girl you didn’t even </span>
<em>
<span>kiss?” </span>
</em>
<span>Nat asked</span>
<em>
<span>.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, what the fuck is wrong with me.” Rio asked, slapping her forehead lightly. “For some weird reason, I can’t shake her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It sounds like you can’t stand the fact that you met the only other woman, apart from me of course, who is immune to your wiles.” Nat teased.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“As I remember correctly, you were not so immune when my fingers were all up in your…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah okay, okay!” Nat interrupted. “So what? You want me to ask Wanda to ask her if she likes you back, like junior high shit?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I guess, I just want to know why she… disappeared on me. Like we had a good time, we were having fun and she did say she’ll text me. What if I left her in a ditch when I left in the uber? I don’t know, I have a weird feeling about her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well actually, Wanda and Jen had to leave their apartment after the double murder last week. You know it happened right in the alley next to their apartment building.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re kidding, I thought the building looked a bit familiar on the news.” Rio leaned forward.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, it’s crazy, so they are staying away for now, it's only temporary, but I assume Agnes probably did the same. Wanda said it’s only till the coast is clear and the trial starts.” Nat paused for a bit. “I saw on the news, they caught the guys, some anonymous tipper gave the police exactly what they needed to catch them. Wanda said the trial was starting next week, pretty fucking fast, so you know thise guys are bad news.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah it sounds like it.” Rio couldn’t help but think of Agnes. Was she so affected by this that she had to get away? </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“But I will ask Wanda if she knows, maybe she’ll even give Agnes’s number to me?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Would you mind? I just want to check in. If she tells me to fuck off I’ll do it.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agnes’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The safe house was… fine. It was more like a dormitory, but Agnes felt safe enough. She told her mom she was staying with friends and she told her friends she was staying with her mom. Classic high school shit. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The prosecuting attorney came over to discuss her testimony in preparation for the trial. When this is finally over she could get back to normal. The trial would start in a week, record timing apparently, but she was told that they had been building the case against Mr. Bohner for years and her final testimony was exactly what they needed to put him away for life. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>In the meantime Agnes caught up with some of her assignments. She thought back to that night. It started out so perfect and she actually liked spending time with Rio and then her fucking curiosity went and messed everything up. Why did she have to go to the alley? Why didn’t she just go into her apartment and just text Rio?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Now, ten days later, a text out of the blue will make her look like a pathetic asshole, plus she wasn’t technically allowed to contact anyone outside of the prosecution team. So she was in a bind. She wishes she could have had the chance to explain to Rio why she had gone silent. Now nobody knew she was here and she couldn’t tell anyone anything. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio probably forgot about her anyway, sure they had fun, but nothing really happened and why would Rio be interested in her anyway. She had a reputation as being a big flirt and Agnes thought of herself as being… plain in comparison to the girls she thought Rio usually liked. She didn’t want to flatter herself by thinking that Rio was somewhere out there pining by her phone for a text from Agnes. That wasn’t happening.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Over the next few days the prosecution team rehearsed her testimony and went over the last details before the trial. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Will they know it was me?” Agnes asked nervously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agnes, you will be in court in front of the defendants. Your testimony will most likely result in a guilty verdict, and we can’t assure you that they will not be able to retaliate, but we will certainly do our best, whatever the outcome. You will be safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What if I am not? They’ll know who I am, what my name is, it’s not that difficult to track someone these days if you have basic information about them.” Agnes felt sick.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s just focus on the trial and your statement next week, okay? We need to be sure that whatever you say in court will put them away otherwise all of this would have been for nothing.”</span>
</p><p>

<span>Agnes didn’t feel any less stressed about the trial. If anything she wishes the last two weeks never happened, and she felt completely alone. She wished she could call Wanda or Jen, fuck even her mother or Lillia. She just had to make it through the trial and one more week. That’s what the prosecutor said, one more week.</span>

<b>
<em>Agnes’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>One more week.</span>
</em>
<span> That turned into two. Fuck that felt like a lifetime was passing before her eyes. The trial was a complete mess, but her testimony had the necessary evidence for the jury to decide that Ralph Bohner and his two goons were found guilty of murder. After her testimony the man jumped up and tried to get closer, only to be dragged away in handcuffs yelling over his shoulder “You’re a dead bitch Agnes O’Connor!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes remembers the cold shiver running down her spine when she heard her name being shouted as he was being dragged away. And to make things even worse, the defense lawyer was no one other than her own mother dearest, Evanora O’Connor. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A conflict of interest that should have prevented her mother from representing them, that was expertly explained away with only the years of experience gained from defending the absolute worst of society. She expected nothing less from her mother. The fear and absolute betrayal she felt at the time sitting in court facing her mother, as the co-council cross examined her would haunt her forever. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After the trial Agnes was taken to a quiet room in the courthouse. She was reeling from what just happened. Her mother defending the murderers, her mother using everything she knew about her to get her to crack, and then the death threat after the verdict. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Surprisingly, Lillia managed to sneak in to talk to Agnes before the police and prosecution team came in to debrief her after the trail.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agnes, if I had known…” Lillia said, concerned. “Your mother never said you’re the witness. She should have never allowed this to happen, to cross examine you like that. It is unheard of, I am surprised she got away with it.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“How could she defend him? He’s a monster Lillia! He’s literally threatening to kill me and she just stood there. She was more concerned about losing the case than she was about her own daughter’s life.” Agnes burst out crying. “What’s going to happen to me now? I can’t go out there, he’s still got people on the outside, he knows where I live, he knows my name…I can’t even trust my own mother anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“There are protections available for you Agnes, and I’ll make sure of it. I promise.” Lillia tried to console her but nothing she could say was going to change the fact that her life was in actual danger and she felt completely isolated and alone. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lillia kissed her on her forehead, promising to make sure she was okay and snuck out of the room just before the detective and prosecutor entered the small room she was waiting in.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agnes, we need to talk about what happened here today.” The prosecutor said, “Obviously we aren’t taking it lightly that your life may now be in danger. Ralph Bohner is a powerful man and we can’t be certain that he won’t have contact with his gang members outside of prison.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wha-what does that mean, exactly?” Agnes asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re getting you into the witness protection program. You’ll be moved to a safe place, under the supervision of one of our agents, and when enough time has passed you will be able to come back.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, I don’t understand. How long will I be away? And what about my family, my friends and my degree. I have a life here!” Agnes felt like her world was collapsing around her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t know how long Miss O’Connor, but we’ll be able to set everything up from here. Your background story, your home, new identity. We have counselors who help with the transition. They will also assist with the story you tell the people you are leaving behind.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Leaving behind? Do you mean, I am breaking contact with… with everyone and everything I have ever known? Is this a joke?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No Agnes, this is life or death. You can refuse but we can't guarantee your or your loved one’s safety otherwise.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes was sobbing, what was fucking happening? This couldn’t be real! One moment she was on cloud nine after having one fucking ice cream with Rio, and weeks later she was being shipped off to god knows where with a new identity and a new life.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This isn’t fair! </span>
<em>
<span>He’s</span>
</em>
<span> the fucking murderer and I am the one paying for it!?” She screamed in frustration.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The program is there to protect you Agnes. It’s been done more times than you will ever know. And most people get to return to their old lives after a while.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I at least call someone? Do I have any say in how and when this happens?” Agnes was pleading now.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s protocol to remove you from any and all danger as soon as possible, unfortunately that time seems to be… now. While we can still move you without Ralph’s people knowing. They’re probably scrambling after the verdict, so we should strike now.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agnes was at a loss for words. </span>
<em>
<span>Unfortunately that time seems to be now. </span>
</em>
<span>The words spinned in her head over and over again eventually nothing made sense anymore, and somewhere in between the blurry words in her vision, a smirk and two dark brown eyes were staring back at her. Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean she’s </span>
<em>
<span>gone</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio asked Jen confused.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought she was still staying with her mother, but no. When we got back to the apartment after the trial, all her things were just gone, three month’s rent was in an envelope on the coffee table with a note saying that she got a job offer she couldn’t refuse and that she had to leave immediately. Believe me I am pissed. She just fucking left, no goodbye nothing.” Jen said angrily. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda was crying, “I can’t believe she just left like that, I mean I thought we were close. We lived together for three years! Not even Lilia can tell us what happened.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was dumbstruck. “I barely knew her, but I guess I was blindsided. Bullet successfully dodged.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nat clinked her bottle with Rio’s. “Looks like it babe, if she could pick up and fuck off that easily, she was definitely not going to waste her time with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The table was silent for a while. “It’s just strange,” Rio said contemplating something, “When we spoke, she had plans, you know. There was the staff opening in the history department at the university, her PHD, I mean I guess you could do that anywhere, but the way she spoke about her friends and her life here… she didn’t seem like the type to pack up and disappear in the middle of the night. Did you go to the police? Maybe she was kidnapped by those gang guys?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda nodded, “We did, actually. They said they were able to reach her and confirm that she was alive and didn’t want….” Wanda started crying again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Didn’t want contact…” Jen finished for her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well fuck,” Nat said exhaling, “I guess you never really know a person.” </span>
</p><p>

<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha Harkness hated Halloween. In a previous life she had one memorable Halloween night and after that her life wasn’t her own anymore. She stood in the small costume rental shop in Westview, New fucking Jersey, where her seven year old son was trying on a costume of a hot dog od all things. This kid had a sense of humor like no other. She pulled her driver’s license out of her wallet and stared at it while she waited, she almost recognized the younger face staring back at her. She barely remembered her old life. Now Agnes O’Connor was more like an old school friend who she lost touch with over the years. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, do I look like a real hot dog in this?” Nicky asked. The foam costume looked ridiculous but Nicky insisted. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, “You sure do! Is that the one you want?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup,” he said laughing at himself in the mirror.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, we’ll take the… hot dog suit.” Agatha said to the lady behind the counter. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Excellent choice.” She winked at Nicky. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed the suit into the trunk of her car and climbed into the driver seat. “Ready to go to your mother’s?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, she and Melinda are taking me trick or treating tonight. It’s going to be so much fun! I wish you could come with us, though.” Nicky said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha loved her son, but spending the evening with her ex and her new girlfriend wasn’t exactly what she thought would be a good time. “You mother loves Halloween way more than I do, kid. Just go and enjoy yourself this week, okay, I’ll pick you again up next Sunday afternoon.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, mom.” Nicky said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When she moved to Westview she became Agatha Harkness. High school history teacher, relocating from the big city to small town New Jersey for a simpler life. Somewhat believable. People downscaled constantly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her Witness Protection agent, Alice, was the only person she knew, but they soon developed a friendship and Agatha started feeling less alone. Her new job as a history teacher at Westview high wasn’t as exciting but she learned to love the kids in her classes. She also helped out with the after school programs assisting the drama teacher, Mrs. Davis, who insisted that she join the teachers for drinks after the first school play she helped with. That night she met Maria Hill, the science teacher.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They went on a few dates and before she knew it, they were engaged and eventually married. Alice was the only person Agatha invited to their wedding. Two years later, Agatha gave birth to their son Nicky. Five years later, after many fights and tears, mostly Maria‘s, they decided to get a divorce. They had a much better relationship as exes actually, it turned out and Agatha also  liked Maria’s new girlfriend Melinda May. True to lesbian fashion, her circle of friends now consisted of Alice, her ex wife and her girlfriend. What a fucking joke.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After Agatha dropped Nicky off at Maria’s she decided to go to the bar down the road from her house, she had the whole weekend and week to herself and she didn’t feel like spending it in front of her television tonight. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat at a small table hidden away in the bar, reading a book and nursing a big glass of red wine while she waited for Alice to arrive. She probably looked fucking ridiculous reading at a bar at 4pm on a Friday afternoon, but the bar was quiet and the wine was good enough. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What the </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span> are </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> doing here?” She heard a familiar voice suddenly. When she lifted her eyes up from her book she saw no one other than Jennifer Kale.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen?” She said, taking off her glasses. Just then Alice walked up to Agatha and she saw the two women staring at each other. “W-what are </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> doing </span>
<em>
<span>here</span>
</em>
<span>, Jen?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I asked you first, Agnes.” Jen scolded.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t… don’t call me that here please.” Agatha whispered in a hurried tone. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh fuck,” Alice said, sitting down quickly and grabbing at Jen’s hand to pull her down into the seat next to her. “Agatha, do you know Jen?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” both Agatha and Jen answered at the same time.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck okay, uhm before anyone says anything else. Let me just make a call. Jen baby, could you please get us some drinks?” She asked. </span>
<em>
<span>Jen baby? </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha thought hearing the term of endearment for the woman. “And Agatha, stay here and don’t talk to </span>
<em>
<span>anyone</span>
</em>
<span> until I tell you to.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was so confused and the way Jen was staring at her from the bar, she knew she wasn’t the only one trying to make sense of it all.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Jen came back to the table at the same time and took their seats again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Before we start, Jen, I need you to stay calm as I explain this okay?” Alice said cautiously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was still staring at Jen, her friend from ten years ago, now sitting in front of her, holding her Witness Protection agent’s hand while she was explaining the current twilight zone they were sitting in now.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“…so after the trial, they had to evacuate the witness, Agnes, and relocate her to a safe place, here, where they gave her a new name, Agatha, and I was assigned to be her WPA, easy as that.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha simply blinked and sipped her wine as she listened unphased as Alice explained the events leading up to the end of her life as she knew it in less than five minutes. As if she was listening to a gardening podcast, she numbly took another sip of her wine. “There you have it, the story of how Agnes became Agatha.” She said plainly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen stared at her, silently studying her. She narrowed her eyes, “We fucking hated you, we burned your pictures after a night of drinking too much, hell I think we even cursed you the next Halloween.” Jen laughed nervously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled a sad smile, “Well I think it worked, I am fucking cursed. I’m a divorced lesbian history teacher, living in the middle of nowhere with exactly five friends which sadly includes my WPA, my seven year old son, his mother and her girlfriend and a sixty year old drama teacher who’s name I keep getting wrong. Really living the life here.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ha!” Alice laughed awkwardly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe you were </span>
<em>
<span>here</span>
</em>
<span> all this time? Do you know I work at Mount Sinai Hospital now, it’s less than an hour from here, and in ten years, I never run into you, until I agree on coming to my girlfriend’s local bar for Halloween, to meet her old friend, which turned out to be… you.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Small fucking world.” Agatha mumbled into her wine.</span>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio woke up with a throbbing headache. The late afternoon sun pierced through the small opening in the black out curtains she haphazardly pulled closed after stumbling into her room at 2am this morning. Another fucking Halloween party. Why was she still going to these parties? She couldn’t answer that. Maybe it was hope, maybe she was just pathetic. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It has been ten years. Ten Halloween parties. Three failed relationships. One big wedding, not hers. Four promotions to partner at the firm and absolutely zero fucking texts from Agnes. It was sad actually, no it was fucking pathetic, Rio should donate her brain to science because never in the earth’s existence has any being been this fucking pathetic. There are worms without brains or eyes that are less pathetic than Rio, who after meeting a woman once ten years ago, still couldn’t get her out of her head.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Pah-the-tic!</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>And has she tried? Yes, the list of blocked numbers on her phone would be enough proof on its own. Her last relationship ended just weeks ago, what could she say? The woman wasn’t Agnes and she was extremely boring. Nat and Wanda’s wedding had a few attractive distractions, which was fun for a while, but as hot as the sex was, the woman had the sense of humor of a potato. Rio was doomed. Doomed to compare every woman she ever met with the one that seemingly got away, the one she never even had more than a few hours with.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled out of her bed, feeling like death warmed up and hung onto the fridge door as she willed the contents in her fridge to magically turn into breakfast other than just ingredients. She grabbed the jar of peanut butter and bread and proceeded to make some toast. She needed to get groceries. Absentmindedly she scrolled through her phone, when suddenly it started ringing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You will </span>
<em>
<span>never</span>
</em>
<span> believe where I am right now!” Jen whispered from the other end of the line.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Good afternoon Rio, how are you Rio? That is how you start a call or did you lose your fucking manners when you moved to New York?” Rio said, taking a bite of her toast.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s almost 5pm Rio, and are you already drunk? Isn’t it Nat’s party tonight?” Jen said bluntly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, that was last night, they have theatre tickets or something gay like that, so Halloween had to move, oh and if you called just to shit on me and tell me the time, I’m hanging up.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, I found her!” Jen whispered louder this time.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Who? Your other personality?” Rio joked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No you asshole, Agnes!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio dropped her phone on the counter, no on her peanut butter toast, screen side down of course, but she could still hear Jen’s muffled voice through the peanut butter. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hold on Jen, I… I’m putting you on speaker.” Rio picked up her phone and froze for a second, she quickly licked enough peanut butter off the screen to put the call on loudspeaker. “What do you mean you </span>
<em>
<span>found her?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll have to come here. I swore to Alice I wouldn’t tell you anything over the phone.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen, I am so fucking confused.” Rio hung her head and scrunched her face. “Come where?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll send you the details. But Rio, tell </span>
<em>
<span>no</span>
</em>
<span> one. Not even Nat and Wanda. Just, get here as soon as you can, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen, what the fuck? Do you expect me to come to wherever you are, based on absolutely no other information other than a </span>
<em>
<span>get here now</span>
</em>
<span> and a lovation pin?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes,” she answered bluntly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And who the fuck is Alice?” Rio asked, frustrated.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That's…. not important now. Look Rio, just get here, okay. For ten years we had to sit and listen to your one-that-got-away monologues and now that you might finally get answers or closure you are being fucking difficult.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio considered everything Jen just told her for a moment. “Fine. Send me the location.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched as a pin and an address appeared in her inbox. She clicked on the pin. Fuck it was three and a half hours away. She’ll be there in less if she pushes it.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The bar was starting to fill up more, some patrons were dressed in their Halloween costumes and others were simply here because what else was there to do on a Friday night in this small town? Alice came back from the bar and slid another glass of wine in front of Agatha. Jen was still in the ladies room and Agatha wondered what was taking her so long.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So what now Alice?” Agatha asked. “Now that my cover is probably blown…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, an old friend running into you is not a blown cover, we just have to try and keep the lid on it, you know, if one person knows, depending on the relationship with that person, nothing needs to change. But that means we have to try to keep it to only one person.” Alice explained.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, well we’ll have to tell Jen that, she’s always been a gossip.” Agatha smiled, remembering her old friends and how they would sit around and chat and gossip in their shared living room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just then, as if summoned, Jen emerged from the ladies room and sat back down at the table.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you okay?” Alice asked, “You were gone for a while.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I just took a minute, you know, to… process. It’s not normal to find your ex-best friend again after she disappeared ten years ago.” Jen said. Something in her voice was off, Agatha couldn’t place it, but she hasn’t been around her for so long, so maybe this is Jen now. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha remained quiet. Like Jen, she was processing. But unlike Jen she lost a lot more than just a friend back then. Without so much as a decent goodbye she packed up and left her whole life and future career behind. After ten years, it felt like she was still processing </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So, </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha, </span>
</em>
<span>what is your life like here, now?” Jen looked genuinely interested, like she really was trying to get to know her again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh uhm… I teach history at Westview High, I help with the drama club after school, I got married then divorced and have a seven year old son and a rabbit. Nothing exciting. Just the regular hiding from drug gangs and murderers in small town New Jersey kinda stuff, you know.” Agatha said dryly. “But tell me about everyone else?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen blinked, “Okay… well Nat and Wanda finally got together, they married like three years after you left. I ended up in New York for my internship and now I’m in the oncology department… oh and your mother, she and Lillia had a very public separation of their firm, after the trial your mother got dropped from the bar, something about ethical violations, Wanda would be able to explain this better, but your mother sort of disappeared after that and now Lillia and Wanda have their own firm.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, I… fuck I missed out on so much.” Agatha felt the tears welling up in her eyes. “Wanda got married? And my mother, she disappeared? Do you even know if she is okay?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wanda says Lillia has people who know things, who keep track of people. I wouldn’t be surprised if she knew where you were.” Jen said, taking a sip of her drink again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Doubt it…” said Alice flippantly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha actually missed her mother even though she could never forgive her for defending Ralph Bohner and his goons. And Lillia, the woman who provided a safe place when her own home felt like a war zone, she really missed her too. And Wanda’s wedding, she always said that she was going to be a bridesmaid, but she never got to share this with her friend. Hell, she couldn’t even share her own wedding with them, even though it didn’t work out. But really, she was trying to fight what she actually wanted to ask Jen about. Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“But in all honesty, Agn… </span>
<em>
<span>Ag, </span>
</em>
<span>Wanda would probably never bring it up anyway, you know, I mean we missed you and talked about you a lot but it… hurt, we thought you left and didn’t want to know us anymore. And Rio…” Jen stopped talking suddenly, Agatha wanted her to continue, she wanted to know what was going on in her life too. “Well now that I know where you are, we could maybe catch up? Is that allowed, or something you would even want?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You kind of have a big mouth Jen, I might have to kill you to keep you quiet. I don't need you blabbing to the world where I have been hiding out.” Agatha joked trying to break the tension. “But if it is allowed, I would actually love that. I really don’t have a lot of people here that I can stand for long enough to have an actual friendship with, except Alice, but she gets it.“ Agatha smiled at Alice, “But technically she is being paid to be my friend, so who really knows if this friendship is real?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice bumped Agatha’s shoulder “You know I love you, Ag, but I must admit, the check in the mail does make it a bit more bearable.” she joked. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The three women laughed and ordered another few rounds, the bar got fuller and by 9pm they were more than enjoying themselves. Many things may have changed in the last ten years, but Agatha’s love for karaoke never did, and she could put up quite the performance. She was on stage drunkenly singing Crazy on You by Heart and just as she was in the middle of her air guitar solo she looked up from the stage and then she saw her. Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Rio received the address of the bar in Westview she grabbed what she needed and jumped into her car. Her GPS said the drive to “Tony’s Liquor and Diner” was 3:27 hours exactly, but Rio’s Range Rover would be driving faster than the speed limit today, she’ll worry about the speeding tickets later. All she could think about was how she needed to actually see Agnes, to know that she was okay, and </span>
<em>
<span>then </span>
</em>
<span>she could throw one of Tony’s fine beers straight in her face and drive back home. Dramatic, yes, but she couldn’t explain the pull ten years ago and that same pull was in charge now.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The road was long. Rio left just after 5:15pm and would probably be there by 8pm at least. She turned up the radio and took another drag of her cigarette, she was nervous. Where has she been all this time? What has she done? Was she happy? Did she regret leaving the way she did? Did she even think about her?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>These questions mulled over and over in her head, no matter how many songs she sang at the top of her lungs, every thought started with one of those questions. Rio sighed in relief as the sign on the side of the road finally read “</span>
<em>
<span>Welcome to Westview: Home is where you make it</span>
</em>
<span>” The irony didn’t escape her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A few miles past the sign she saw the flashing signage of Tony’s. She pulled her car into one of the few open parking spaces, the place looked very busy. Well it was Friday night in the middle of nowhere and it was Halloween, so it made sense for people to be enjoying themselves tonight.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Stepping out of the car she started to hear the sounds of an obviously drunk person butchering one of her favorite Heart songs. </span>
<em>
<span>Karaoke was both a blessing and a curse sometimes</span>
</em>
<span>, she thought. She entered the bar and looked for Jen, then her eyes were drawn to the person responsible for the loud cheers, and there she was, Agnes, obviously drunk but obviously enjoying herself with her air guitar solo. Without thinking about it, she slowly walked to the front of the stage and stared up into the same bright blue eyes she remembered from exactly ten years ago. Agnes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched as Agnes dropped the microphone and froze, the karaoke backtrack of the song was still playing but Agnes stood still and stared at Rio like she was a ghost. Finally the song stopped playing and that seemed to break her out of her stupor. She watched as she walked to the stage stairs, picked up a drink from a small table, downed the contents of the glass and walked towards Rio. No, she walked past her and pulled Rio’s arm for her to follow.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She was being pulled outside and followed almost in a trancelike state herself. Her body moved by without her telling it to. Outside she stopped and watched Agnes as she stepped ahead a little further away and stopped with her back still turned to her. The woman standing in front of her seemed so different yet so familiar. Rio didn’t move, she simply stared and waited. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As if a switch had flipped, Agnes turned around and walked to Rio with purpose. Before she had time to respond, to look, to move away, soft hands grabbed at her face and soft lips met hers instantly. When her brain finally caught up with her body, she threw her arms around Agnes and pulled her closer, returning the kiss that she had been wanting for for the last ten years.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kissed Rio, her body wasn’t hers. She felt like she was watching it all happen from far away, but she felt it, god did she feel it, Rio’s soft full lips dragging over hers, Rio’s hands and arms pulling her closer, Rio’s warm breath blowing through her nose tickling her skin. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly everything felt too much. She broke away from the kiss and stepped away, putting a few feet of distance between herself and Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck sorry, I shouldn’t have, I didn’t mean to…” she started apologizing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t move, she stood in front of Agatha, looking at her like she was staring at nothing and everything at the same time, her mouth slightly open. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agn…” she heard Rio start but she was interrupted when Alice and Jen suddenly came out of the bar. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Jen. “</span>
<em>
<span>You</span>
</em>
<span> called her?” She asked almost angrily.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked like she was caught breaking into a bank. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, who else knows, Jen? This was a mistake, I… I need to leave.” Agatha said. She was fighting not to cry but the fear and her tears were starting to build up. She turned around and started stumbling forward on the way to her car.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, wait,” Alice yelled. “You can’t drive, you’re drunk.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped in her tracks and pressed her hands to her eyes. “Then I’ll fucking walk.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could turn to walk into the direction of where she thought her house would be she heard Rio say, “I’ll drive you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The four women stood still, Agatha felt their eyes burning holes through her body. “Fine, whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After another few silent seconds Agatha asked, “Well? Am I walking or what?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fiddled with her keys and shared a quick look with Jen which Agatha wished she could interpret, her brain was too foggy to comprehend anything at the moment. Agatha followed Rio to a big black Range Rover. “Wow, this is </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> car? Are you like </span>
<em>
<span>rich</span>
</em>
<span> rich now?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed as she helped Agatha into the passenger seat. “I mean I do okay,” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Pfft, if this is doing okay, my life is even more pathetic than I thought.” Agatha mumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Come on, let’s get you out of here.” Rio said before closing the door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat in the car, it was fancy, </span>
<em>
<span>way</span>
</em>
<span> better than her little sedan she was driving. She watched Rio walk to the driver’s side and get in. “So where am I driving to?” Rio asked her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just go straight and turn left at the first street.” Agatha was pointing in the general direction of her house and felt the car come alive and pull away.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Turn here,” she said, feeling the car turn into the street. “And then right here.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow,” Rio said as they stopped, “You really could have walked. The bar is like less than a mile from here…I think I can still hear the music actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, but you were insistent and I am in no condition to fight you.” Agatha said, pulling up her fists as if she was going to fight. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment they sat in the car and Agatha sighed and suddenly felt her stomach turn. “I think I am going to be sick,” she opened the door and stumbled out, almost immediately feeling her hair being pulled back and being guided to the garden.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When she was done, Rio gave her a tissue to wipe her face. </span>
<em>
<span>This was fucking humiliating,</span>
</em>
<span> she thought. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are your keys?” Rio asked helping Agatha up.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled the keys out from her pocket to gave it to Rio. “You have to wiggle it a bit.” Agatha said shaking them in front of Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha followed Rio to the front door, watching her wiggle the keys in the lock and opening the door for her. She walked to the sofa and plopped down into the cushions. When she opened her eyes after a brief second, she saw Rio standing frozen in the doorway. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“There are some drinks in the fridge, help yourself.” She gestured to the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked to the kitchen and when she came back she held two beers and a bottle of water. “I don’t know if you should still be drinking, but you make your own rules.” She put the beer bottle and water bottle on the table in front of Agatha and sat down in the high back chair opposite her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at the two bottles on the table, she considered drinking the beer but the water would help sober her up a bit and she felt like she already fucked up enough tonight. So she grabbed the water and drank half of it before putting it back onto the table. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha with concern, or was it confusion or worse was it indignation? “Don’t look at me like that, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned forward and placed her beer onto the table. “You have a son?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, “Yeah, Nicky. He is seven.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, and you have a rabbit?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup, Señor Scratchy, his more Nicky’s than mine.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And you are </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span> now.” The way Rio’s mouth shaped the name felt weird.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what my papers say.” Agatha raised an eyebrow. The name wasn’t that bad. “I went from one old lady's name to another. Seems like Witness Protection ran out of cool names like Kathryn or whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It still suits you.” Rio said quietly. “Witness Protection… is that what this is… why you left?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha considered Rio for a moment. This was already crossing so many lines. In one night she blew her cover to not one, but two people. But this was </span>
<em>
<span>Rio</span>
</em>
<span>, and whatever force drew them together that night was still here, alive and well.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That night we met, you left with the uber and I heard yelling and for some fucking reason I went towards it and saw the two men get shot and killed. I heard everything and they saw me, I had to testify in the trial and when they were convicted they threatened my life and before I had any chance to process what happened I was already placed in witness protection. So now I am here, Agatha Harkness, high school history teacher who needed a break from the big bad city and chose the butthole of New Jersey as my soft landing place to start a new life.” Agatha couldn’t help the bitterness in her voice.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t all bad, in the beginning I cried a lot, I mean I lost everything I worked for, everyone I loved, and I was so alone.” Agatha drank the last of the water in the bottle. “Alice was my appointed agent and we soon became friends, I met and married Maria, we were happy for a while and then came Nicky, and then we divorced… and now I am sitting here in front of the one person I never thought I’d ever see again.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, Agatha stared at her. “I’m sorry, is my fucking life a joke to you?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, no, I think I just… do you know how much this has fucked me up? And here you are, a three hour drive from me, completely the same but completely different.” Rio stopped laughing and her face turned serious. “I thought I imagined you, you disappeared like you were never even real, but I never stopped thinking about you, about your fucking words that have haunted my thoughts every day for ten years “</span>
<em>
<span>Mind if I text you…”</span>
</em>
<span>. I have waited for that text since that night.” Rio’s head fell into her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened the beer bottle in front of her, she didn’t drink from it, she simply held it in her hands. “I begged them to let me call someone, to let me call you.” Agatha wasn’t looking at Rio. “You never deserved feeling like I ghosted you or whatever.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And you never deserved…this.” Rio finished.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, well, it’s not all bad. I had Nicky and that made up for most of it. I think without him I would have jumped off the water reservoir halfway through my time here…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The two sat quietly for a while, taking in everything that just happened. “Do you need a place to stay?” Agatha asked. “There is a spare bedroom with its own bathroom through the door there.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I think that will be okay, if you don’t mind. I didn’t really think this through when I drove here.” Rio admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re more than welcome,” Agatha stood up and headed for the stairs. “Use what you need, I will see you in the morning.” Agatha walked to her bedroom and heard the guest bedroom door open and shut. She fell onto her bed and softly cried herself to sleep for the first time in years.</span>

<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Waking up in </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha’s </span>
</em>
<span>home felt surreal. In total, the amount of actual hours she has spent with Agnes/Agatha since they met, was only about fifteen hours if you include the hours of sleep she just woke up from. That number is insignificant if you calculate the percentage over the timeline of ten years. A drop in a very big bucket of time, but Rio has never felt a connection this intense with anyone before. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>And the kiss, however unexpected, felt ten years overdue. It wasn’t perfect at all, it wasn’t even that long. It was hurried, and sloppy and drunk, but it was needed. Rio didn’t realize how much she wanted </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> kiss to happen until it finally did. And now she needed more, under better circumstances of course, but now that she finally knew what Agatha felt like pressed up against her, cupping her face and the feel of her lips on hers she needed that again, she needed </span>
<em>
<span>more</span>
</em>
<span>.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had to remind herself that Agatha had been drinking the night before and if there was anyone on earth who knows how fast things can happen after a few drinks it was Rio. Maybe it was just that, a drunken kiss, an impulsive decision based on the sudden reappearance of an old flame, if that was even what she was. Something impulsive that she will most likely regret when she realizes what she has done. Also, not one word was said about it after it happened. Did it even happen? It had to have, her lips still felt the ghosts of Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled over in the bed and stared at the painting on the wall. It was one of those generic paint blob paintings you would buy to fill up an empty wall. No meaning or thought was put into the design and it was mass produced to hang in every other home across the country. Somehow the painting felt out of place in the room she was lying in. Everything else looked deliberate. Some pieces of furniture looked more used than the rest but they were probably carefully selected and purchased from some second hand store in town. Unlike the painting the room was warm and felt like Agatha. She had made a home for herself in this house, Rio realized. Another life here in Westview. Even after the disruption of being forced to relocate and start over, she found a way to still have something warm.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wondered what Agatha’s bedroom would look like. She wondered if it also felt personal and warm, like she remembered her to be that first night. Rio shook her head and got up to walk to the bathroom. She needed to take a shower to help clear her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha heard the shower in the guest bathroom turn on. Something about knowing who was behind the closed doors of the room stirred something in her. Her head was killing her and the sound of the effervescent tablet dissolving in the glass in front of her was almost too loud.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She thought back to the events and the conversations of the night before. And the kiss, she acted completely on impulse and pure </span>
<em>
<span>need</span>
</em>
<span>. Her stomach turned, but not from her hangover but rather because of her past and her present colliding all at once. She buried Agnes O’Connor the day she set foot in this house. She mourned the death of her and her life and her friends and family she had to leave behind. Now, seemingly resurrected, they were no longer just ghosts or suppressed memories, they were all too real again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It was a complete coincidence that Jen showed up with Alice yesterday, and then Rio who came after Jen called her. But coincidences don't just happen like this, and that was what was eating her up. If she was this easy to run into accidentally, how easy will it be for Ralph’s gang to find her, to find Nicky? She picked up her phone and sent a text to Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>We need to talk. About RB.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When she heard the shower turn off she decided to get some breakfast ready for her and Rio, if she was staying that is. Maybe she should just start with coffee. Agatha turned to the coffee machine and started a brew. If Rio wanted to stay for breakfast she'd make something quick and easy, and if she wanted to leave, Agatha would be fine to pour out the extra coffee and move on with her day.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As if on cue, the guest room door creaked open and Rio, dressed in only the t-shirt from the night before and her underwear, peeked out of the room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Uhm, I forgot my bag in the car last night.” She said softly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help but stare at the pair of toned legs sticking out from under the shirt. “I can get it.” she offered. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks,” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled shyly as she walked, almost stumbling past her to the front door. She took the car key and went outside. The crisp November air hit her squarely in the chest and she took in a deep breath to steady herself. She opened the car and found the small bag of clothes haphazardly thrown in the back of the Range Rover.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When she walked back into the house Rio was sitting on the sofa, scrolling through her phone. She gently put the bag down next to the guest room door. “I made coffee, if you’d like some.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, that will actually be great. Let me just get dressed.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hopped up from the sofa and disappeared back into the guest room. Agatha let out a breath. Her hangover combined with the storm in her mind was making her feel sick all over again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed on the counter. She expected a text from Alice, but instead it was from Maria.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>

<span>Check out our Hot Dog” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Two pictures of Nicky dressed like a hot dog were sent after the text, one with him smiling wide next to Maria and another of just Nicky pulling a funny face. She laughed at the picture and saved the second one to her camera roll.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The coffee smells great.” Rio said as she walked over to the kitchen. Agatha poured her a cup and slid it over to her on the counter. Rio was wearing fitted sweatpants and a loose t-shirt, she looked effortlessly casual and attractive at the same time. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha poured herself a cup to distract herself from staring too long. “Are you hungry? I don't have many options but I can make toast and eggs or if you need a sugar rush, Nicky’s cereal will definitely do the trick.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmmm. What cereal?” Rio smirked, looking interested in the second option.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed out an amused breath and opened the pantry pulling out a box of cereal, which could only be described as sugar coated sugar balls. “He loves this and I know it’s bad for him, but he was such a fussy eater when he was smaller that I tend to give in to him when he finally decides to actually eat something. Don’t tell his other mother that.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Not surprisingly, Rio chose the cereal and Agatha made herself some toast with jam. She watched Rio pour the milk over the sugary cereal and like a giddy kid she took a big spoon full. Agatha smirked while she took a bite of her toast. “Do you always eat like this?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, sugar is an important part of the food pyramid. Your kid has good taste, this is quality cereal.” Rio said with a mouth full. Agatha snickered at that. Who was this woman she barely knew but felt so familiar with?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s smile lingered on Rio for a moment, “You are like a child.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned, “You have no idea, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head and put the dirty dishes in the sink to deal with later when she felt less like an alcohol soaked rag. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So what does the lovely town of Westview have to offer for entertainment to the odd tourist passing through?” Rio asked, propping up her chin on the palm of her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well there is Tony’s, a fine establishment of course,” Agatha mocked, “Then there’s a pretty decent coffee shop and bookstore, there’s a small roller rink that doubles as the rec centre for bingo nights on Wednesdays… oh and the drive in on Saturdays. They mostly show older movies, but it’s not bad and Nicky loves it.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tapped her chin with her pointer finger. “Okay, and if said tourist wanted to take someone out, something special?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha narrowed her eyes, silently analyzing the line of questions coming from Rio, “The Italian restaurant on the town square seems popular for dates. It’s not a five star restaurant but it’s really nice authentic Italian food. The miniature golf course is quite popular for the kids at school… But honestly, I don’t really go out much so I wouldn‘t be of much help.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you mean to say that you, Westview’s own karaoke queen, don’t go on dates? Are the women here blind, straight or both?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her cheeks turning pink, she hadn’t been on a date since before Nicky was born. “Please, this town’s queer population is almost non-existent. With you and Jen in town we might be able to finally start a soccer team, but we'll probably still be short one player.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm so what? You just don’t… date? No sneaky hookups with curious housewives?” Rio asked with another smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope, if there are any </span>
<em>
<span>curious housewives </span>
</em>
<span>here they most certainly aren’t hooking up with me. But I prefer it, I have Nicky every other week and the drama club when the school isn’t closed, that keeps me busy pretty much all the time, and I guess one muddies the pool when you’ve already divorced one of only two available lesbians in town, plus she’s technically dating the other one.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, that sounds… bleak.” Rio said, pulling her face.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do you want to know?” Agatha asked casually.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well you never know when you might meet a curious housewife…” she said with a wink. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Before Agatha could respond to that ridiculous answer there was a knock on the front door. “That’s probably Alice.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio greeted Alice with a wave and a smile when she walked in, “I’ll give you two some space. I will be back in an hour, I think I will go check out the coffee shop you mentioned.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Uhm, okay. I guess I’ll see you later.” She replied.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled at her and stepped outside and Agatha almost felt the air in the house shift. She stared at the closed door for a moment when Alice pulled her back to reality.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You two seem comfortable…” Alice said when Rio pulled the door shut as she walked out.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t start Al…” Agatha warned.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV </em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled the front door closed, walked to her car and climbed in to drive to the town center. She made small mental notes while she listened as Agatha listed the limited number of things to do in town. She wanted to take her on a date, the one she meant to plan before </span>
<em>
<span>Agnes </span>
</em>
<span>disappeared. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled her car into a parking space on the side of the street. Small shop fronts lined the street on both sides. A florist, some strange boutique clothing shop with hideous floral dresses in the window, a thrift shop selling something of everything and a small coffee shop, Wiccan Brew and Books. She’ll start there.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio approached the counter and placed an order for an iced coffee with the teenager behind the register.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re not from here.” The teenager said. Rio noticed his eyeliner and pierced ears. He looked out of place in this seemingly plain town.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What gave it away, kid?” She asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“There are only two other people in town who normally order this in November, me and this edgy cop… And now you. People here are more of the cappuccino or flat white types. Especially when it’s cold.” He said, lifting an amused brow.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you could say I am visiting an old friend.” Rio paused, taking in the kid standing in front of her. “So I guess this means you know most people here, huh?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>He paused his movements, dropping his hand holding the coffee grounds on the counter, “Depends who’s asking.” He said, clearly trying to sum her up in some way.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed softly, “Look I am not here to make any trouble. Just curious. I am not used to small town living. I barely know my neighbor, and this place feels different. Like everyone knows everyone’s business you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“When you work in the only coffee shop in Westview, you tend to get to know people by their coffee orders. Like take Mrs. Davis, my high school drama teacher, always orders the sweetest drink on the menu, her teeth are probably rotting already, but it sort of suits her because she is almost insufferably sweet in person. It’s annoying really. Then there is Mr. Harris, always angry, always a double shot black coffee...”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her eyes glass over, “Okay so you </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> know almost everyone’s business. And you go to Westview High, I assume.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes unfortunately, but I am graduating next year, and then I am out of here. This town feels more like a waiting room, if you know what I mean.” He said winking.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So you are part of our soccer team then?” Rio said, more to herself than anything else.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know what that means.” He said confused.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry about it. So where would be a good place for a date?” Rio saw the boy’s eyes stretch open, “Not with you dummy, with Ag… with my friend.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio saw the realization in his face. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck, her and her big mouth, </span>
</em>
<span>she thought. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, so you’re </span>
<em>
<span>old friend </span>
</em>
<span>is Ms. Harkness. Dirty Chai, double shot, with sugar if she looks like she’s had a bad day, which is usually a lot this time of the year.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Usually a lot this time of the year…</span>
</em>
<span> this time of year was when her life was thrown upside down. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“How do you know Ms. Harkness?” He asked, handing her her order.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a seat behind the counter. “We knew each other… back in college.” Rio realized she actually didn’t know anything about Agnes, let alone Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s my favorite teacher. I don't even like history, but she always lets me sit in her class on off periods, and she was married to my science teacher but that was before I was in high school. They still come here together though, with their son Nicky, and Ms. Hill’s girlfriend. It’s nice that they are still friends...”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re getting sidetracked here,” Rio realized she met the most talkative person in Westview.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh right, the </span>
<em>
<span>date.” </span>
</em>
<span>He smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, although I am already regretting asking. You’re probably going to blab everything to her before I even get to actually ask her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Promise I won’t, I’m great at keeping </span>
<em>
<span>secrets. </span>
</em>
<span>Ok so here’s the deal, this place,” he swirled his hand in the air, “not really date worthy. But if you’re willing to add a twenty minute drive to your date, the next town over, Eastview, I know, real original with the names… it has this amazing Korean barbecue place and right across from the street they have a haunted house that does ghost tours, it’s really fun and Ms. Harkness would love it because it's like historical or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That actually sounds perfect, kid. Don’t tell her I asked you. I will deny it and blame you for being a creep.” Rio warned sucking up the last bit of her drink. She put down the plastic cup, hopped off the chair and walked out. “Thanks Teen!” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked out of the coffee shop, the idea actually really sounded good. Ghost tour followed by a nice dinner. Weird enough to be fun. She walked to the florist and bought a small bouquet of assorted purple flowers before getting back in her car to drive back to Agatha’s. Hopefully her and Alice’s talk was over, she didn’t want to be in the way. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Pulling up in Agatha’s driveway, she saw Alice’s car still parked in front of the garage. She hadn’t really been gone longer than an hour, maybe she should have stayed away longer, she thought. Unsure of what exactly to expect, she left the bunch of flowers in the car and got out. She carefully walked up to the front door and hesitated for a second before opening the door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When she entered the living room she saw Agatha crying with her head in her hands and Alice sitting next to her obviously trying to console her. Agatha’s head shot up and Rio briefly met her eyes. “I uhm, I’ll come back later…” she turned around as quick as she came in and went to sit in her car. </span>

<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll give you two some space. Agatha, I will be back in an hour, I think I will go check out the coffee shop you mentioned.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Uhm, okay. I guess I’ll see you later.” She replied. Rio probably could have stayed but Agatha appreciated the privacy, in case things got too much. She didn’t really know Rio, so keeping some things under wraps for now seemed reasonable.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You two seem comfortable…” Alice said with her mischievous smile.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t start Al…” Agatha warned. “She slept in the guest room, that's all. Westview only has that creepy motel, so other than her car, she didn’t really have any other option.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I was simply making an observation. You are way too defensive this morning.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sit, I need more coffee.” Agatha poured two cups and walked back to the living room. She gave Alice her cup and sat down on the sofa. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So what do I do now? Two people from my past life suddenly showing up out of nowhere… I was supposed to disappear. If they found me this easily without even trying too hard, how easily would Ralph’s guys find me if they </span>
<em>
<span>actually</span>
</em>
<span> tried? The stakes are so much higher than it was then. What if they found me, and Nicky?” Agatha felt herself spiraling.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well technically I brought Jen to you and she told Rio. So as it stands now, no one was actively </span>
<em>
<span>looking </span>
</em>
<span>for you. And the guys in the program have alerts on any movement of known associates of RB. If they were looking, we would have known about it already.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Alice. Was she overreacting? “It’s been ten years, Alice. Is that long enough for them to forget about me? To stop looking?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, I can ask around. If it will make you feel better. There is this guy in the agency who has contacts in the prison system who can dig without making noise. They will be able to find out if RB’s guys have been looking for you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed. This wasn’t a sure answer but Alice would tell her if there was anything. “What do you know about my mother? Jen said she disappeared as well.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stayed quiet, almost too long. “Alice? What do you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Look I don’t really know much, okay. To keep you safe I am only told what I need to know and apparently I don’t need to know anything about that.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So you </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> know something, I know when you lie to me Alice. You have a clear tell.” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t,” Alice said defensively.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice, you pull on your left ear every time. How do you think I always beat you in poker?” Agatha pulled her own ear to show Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice immediately grabbed her ears. “Fine, I know </span>
<em>
<span>something </span>
</em>
<span>but I am technically not supposed to. And if I’m technically not supposed to know, you are definitely not supposed to know. Urgh I am actually such a bad cop.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not that bad, Alice. You just think you are way more badass than you actually are.” Agatha laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice rolled her eyes, “Whatever, it’s a fake job anyway, keeping </span>
<em>
<span>your </span>
</em>
<span>ass safe is my actual job and so far I’m doing great.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You were the one who blew my cover first… If I didn’t like having you around instead of some other babysitter… I didn’t even know you were dating. You almost hid her better than you are hiding me…” Agatha’s thoughts drifted back to the mess she was in now. “But seriously Alice, what do you know?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The trial exposed a lot of ethics violations. Her law firm partner, Lilia, had a lot of fires to put out. Some criminal cases had to be retried, bad people got off that really shouldn’t have and innocent people were sitting in prison because of her… She was bad news. I actually don’t know how you two are related... The last thing I heard, and the last thing I am willing to tell you now, was that she was living under a fake name somewhere and working for some sketchy guys on the west coast as their defense lawyer, they had eyes on her but other than identity theft and generally being a shitty person, they don’t have enough to prosecute her for anything else.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I knew growing up that she wasn’t a good person, she could never hide that completely. Lilia felt more like my mother, she actually loved me and cared for me. Evanora was like an evil stepmother.” Agatha missed Lilia so much. “I sometimes wished Lilia was my real mother…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She sounds like a good person to have around.” Alice said apologetically.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The room fell quiet. Agatha stared at the guest room door where Rio stood in her t-shirt this morning. A small smile crept on her face. “I sometimes wish a lot of things never happened.” she said to no one. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you had to rebuild everything in your life. That isn’t an easy thing to do. When I first met you, you were the saddest person I’ve ever seen. You were crying all the time and I practically had to drag your ass into the shower some days. Look at what you made for yourself. You have this amazing home, a job you actually love, an amazing kid, and me. You are strong Agatha, you are resilient and so brave. Whatever happens with RB, we will deal with it. But I promise you the same thing I did ten years ago. I will do my best to keep you safe, you need to trust me, okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha started crying. It was the fear of the unknown, her past life creeping back into her present, her missing Lilia and even Wanda, it was everything she had bottled up spilling over again. Alice jumped up and ran to her side to console her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I promise okay.” Alice said, rubbing Agatha’s back. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m a mess, Alice. I know it doesn’t always look like it, but I am. And now Rio is here and I have no fucking idea what I am doing. I kissed her last night. I didn’t even say </span>
<em>
<span>hello</span>
</em>
<span> or </span>
<em>
<span>nice to see you</span>
</em>
<span>, I just kissed her out of nowhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought there was a vibe. You never said anything about her when we met.” Alice said curiously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We were never really anything, we barely spent five hours together at a friend’s Halloween party, we had ice cream at 1am and then she made sure I got home safe, I told her I’d text her and that was the last time I saw her before </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> all happened. Till she showed up here. Now I am so confused, it feels like it was just yesterday, but so much time has passed since that night. I am literally a different person now. But I always felt we were… unfinished. We never got the chance to even try to </span>
<em>
<span>be </span>
</em>
<span>anything. And now… now she is here…what the fuck does that even mean? What is she </span>
<em>
<span>doing </span>
</em>
<span>here?” Agatha felt the tears burning in her eyes as she cried into her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She heard movement in front of her and when she looked up, there Rio was standing. What did she actually hear? But before Agatha could comprehend anything, Rio ran out the door. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Agatha said, sniffing as she wiped the tears from her face. “Do you think…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, she just came in, she couldn’t have heard anything. But Agatha, you need to talk to her. I know things are a mess now, but you’ll feel better. I highly doubt there was any physical traceable link between you and Rio before all this, so there will be no lead to you from her unless she talks directly to RB or his guys. And from what I have heard about her from Jen, she seems fiercely loyal to those close to her. She should be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, are you sure? I don’t want to pull her into something that she would be safer without, you know.” Agatha said concerned.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure Agatha, but if you need me too, I could… look into her. See who she is to be safe.” Alice suggested.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, please don’t. I don’t want to invade her personal life. I feel like I can trust her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stood up and grabbed her bag. “Agatha, please don’t worry too much. Let me see what I can find out about RB before we stress too much and overthink this.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you Alice.” Agatha hugged her and walked to the door with her. She opened the front door and immediately saw Rio sitting in her car. She laughed and after Alice left she walked over to the driver’s side of the car and knocked. Rio let down the window.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi,” Agatha said sheepishly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bit her bottom lip, “Hey,” she replied awkwardly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a step back and gestured to the house. “It’s safe to come inside if you want” She waited for Rio to open the car door and get out. “I need actual food so I’m going to warm up a mac and cheese for lunch.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You barely know me, but you already know what I love to eat.” Rio said as she climbed out of the car and followed Agatha inside the house.</span>
</p><p>

</p><p>
<span>Rio followed Agatha to the kitchen where Agatha took out a frozen meal from the freezer and turned on the oven to warm it up. When she sat down behind the kitchen counter she realised she forgot the flowers in the car. Agatha felt too quiet. Was she always this quiet or did the talk with Alice upset her too much to talk to her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please tell me if me being here is a problem Agatha, I don’t want to be in your way or if you feel… if me being here is putting you in danger or anything…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No please, Rio…” Agatha interrupted, she grabbed Rio’s hand. Rio looked down to see Agatha’s hand on hers. It felt warm and grounding. “Please don’t leave. I… I don’t want you to leave. Unless you want to.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha, her eyes were red, still from crying earlier and probably because she was starting to cry again. She turned her palm up to hold onto Agatha’s hand. “I don’t think I want to go.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Agatha whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They looked at each other. The air in the room felt weighted. A moment passed where Rio swore she felt herself move closer without really moving at all. Agatha cleared her throat and squeezed her hand. “Thank you, Rio.” she said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled,  “Actually, I forgot something in the car.” She felt like she didn’t want to let go of Agatha’s hand just yet, but let go anyway to go to the car to get the flowers. “I’ll be right back.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked out to the car and got the flowers. They still looked fresh, the cold weather had some perks she thought. She walked back into the house and hid the flowers behind her back and walked over to Agatha who was standing behind at the oven with her back turned to her. The light coming through the kitchen window highlighted some of her features and Rio thought she looked beautiful, even in her current state of being hungover and clearly upset.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled the flowers out from behind her back and held it in front of her. “Agatha?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned around and saw the flowers. “Rio? What is this?” she asked with a big smile. Rio remembered that smile from years ago, no one smiled like Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“For you.” She said, handing the flowers to her. “They looked like… you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s brows knit together. “I love purple,” she laughed while taking the flowers. “How did you know?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Like I said, they looked like you. I don’t know.” Rio suddenly felt subconscious. “I actually wanted to ask you something.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to put the flowers in a vase. “Okay?” she said hesitantly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Would you go on a date with me? I know we haven’t really spent a lot of time together, but if you like, I would really like to get to know you more. Plus you sort of already kissed me so I think I have some chance of you saying yes.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood frozen and looked like a deer in headlights.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, just, ignore me, forget I asked…” Rio stumbled over her words, but like the night before, Agatha suddenly stepped closer and kissed her. Rio felt herself tense up and let go to pull her closer. This kiss was more intense, yet softer than last night. She moved her hands up to hold onto Agatha’s neck to deepen the kiss. She felt Agatha’s tongue move over hers and the world around them fell silent. Suddenly they were moving, Rio walked Agatha over until she felt her stop against the kitchen counter. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her head was spinning. She felt everything and nothing as their mouths consumed each other. Rio lifted Agatha up onto the counter. Agatha broke the kiss and met Rio’s eyes. The bluest eyes locked with hers. An unspoken conversation passed between them and Rio pulled her closer, kissing her again, slower this time. Rio got lost in the kiss and when the oven dinged she broke out of her haze, pulling back from Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Agatha said. “I keep on doing that.” she smiled awkwardly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s breath was heavy. She rested her hands on the counter next to Agatha and let her head fall onto her shoulder. After a few seconds, she stood upright, “I think your food is burning.” she whispered as she stepped backwards.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha jumped off the counter and pulled open the oven. A ball of steam bellowed out of the oven. She pulled out the dish and dropped it onto the stove top. “Looks like we stopped just in time.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. She was hungry, but she could starve if it meant she got to kiss Agatha again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned around and cupped her face. “Yes.” she said simply.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha confused. “Yes to the date Rio.” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh yeah, I forgot about that.” she laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned widely and turned around to get them some plates. Rio took a deep breath and walked back to sit at the counter as Agatha placed the food in front of her. “It’s about time” Agatha said with a smile “I have waited ten years to go on a date with you. Thought you’d never ask.” she joked. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You never texted me…” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish I did.” Agatha said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed and they ate their food. A quiet comfort fell over them, the shift in the air felt like Rio was meant to be here, like they were always meant to be next to each other.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too.” Rio said, holding onto Agatha’s hand. “Me too.”</span>

<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After lunch Rio helped her with the dishes, there were really only their two plates and whatever was leftover from breakfast, but Agatha appreciated the close proximity they were moving in. When she dried off the last plate, placing it back into the cupboard she felt Rio stare at her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So what are your plans for the rest of the weekend?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wondered what to say, she normally spent her free time alone catching up on her favorite TV shows or grading papers. “Uhm, I actually didn’t have anything planned for this weekend. Nicky is with Maria until next Sunday, and when he is gone I tend to be a bit of a hermit.” Agatha felt like a loser, zero plans, zero social life… </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well you did say yes to the date…” Rio said suggestively.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I did…” Agatha smiled. “So I guess you are my plans.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds like my weekend plans just got much better actually.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They walked over to the sofa and sat down next to each other. Agatha turned on the sofa to face Rio and Rio did the same. Rio took Agatha’s hand and played with her fingers. “So I did some investigative journalism this morning. Your favorite pupil is quite the gossip.” Rio said. Agatha was fixated on the feeling of Rio’s fingers intertwining with hers.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Who?” Agatha asked confused. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>”That little weirdo kid working at the coffee shop.” Rio said, now gently massaging Agatha’s palm.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Billy.” Agatha said, “Yeah, he’s too good for this place.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“He doesn’t seem to fit in here, that’s for sure. But anyway, he told me all the hot gossip and his favorite teacher…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Remind me to fail him.” Agatha said sarcastically. “What did he tell you?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Only that you’re basically the coolest teacher at school. And I'm sure if he wasn’t obviously gay I would have thought that he had a crush on you.” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ha, I’m sure.” Agatha said self consciously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“He would be wrong not too. You’re the kind of history teacher that I would definitely have a crush on…” Agatha watched as Rio’s face turned a light shade of pink. “But he also filled me in on all the hotspots for wooing a girl around town.“</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, did he now? So I’ll have him to thank later then.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Or to fail, depending on how the date goes.” Rio joked. “So what do you say, want to paint the town red with me tonight?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha grinned, “I’m already excited.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After they spent most of the afternoon talking on the sofa Agatha got up to get ready for their date. “Uhm what should I wear?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Whatever is comfortable, I don’t have much packed so don’t worry about being underdressed.” Rio replied. Fuck, she didn’t think about that. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, just give me like twenty minutes?” Agatha said as she disappeared into the direction of her bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked over to the guest bedroom to pull a rabbit out of a hat which she knew she didn’t pack. A date wasn’t really what she thought she’d be here for when Jen called yesterday afternoon. She pulled out her jeans and a simple grey sweater. This will have to do. She got dressed and applied some makeup and let her hair down. She put on her boots and pulled on her trusty leather jacket. Not bad for a haphazard packing job.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Giving herself one last look in the mirror she grabbed her keys and wallet and went back into the living room to wait for Agatha. While she waited she stared at the pictures on the wall. Agatha and Nicky and a rabbit. Agatha and Nicky on the beach. Agatha and Nicky at a baseball game. Nicky in a stroller. Nicky being pushed on a swing. Rio saw happiness hanging all over the walls and wondered if this would still have been what Agatha’s life would’ve looked like if she was still Agnes. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She heard footsteps coming up to her and turned around. Her mouth fell open when she saw Agatha standing next to her. “This isn’t fair, you look like… this…” she said, gesturing to Agatha, “and I look like I’m meeting my mom for coffee.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was wearing black tight leather pants with a black blouse showing off most of her cleavage, heeled boots and a cream jacket. Her red lipstick highlighted the curves of her mouth and her blue eyes looked brighter with the light makeup framing it. “Please, you look great.” Agatha scoffed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio said proudly, “But you look…hot.” I’m really glad I have you to myself tonight, those curious housewives will definitely be paying attention to you when they see this.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed and rolled her eyes, “Come on, Rio, you’re going to make me change my outfit. Let’s get out of here before I lose all my confidence.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took her hand and led her to the car. She opened the door for her and closed it when she got in and ran to the other side. “It’s a bit of a drive, but I was told that this was the best place to go to.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She turned on the car and pulled out of the driveway and followed the GPS to their destination. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This is really a nice car, Rio.” Agatha said, feeling the upholstery.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You said that last night, I didn't take you as a motorhead.” Rio smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No one here drives cars like this.” Agatha said, “This is a </span>
<em>
<span>big city car</span>
</em>
<span>.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What does that mean?” Rio asked, perplexed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know,” she giggled, “This town is filled with old people or family people, more minivans and campervans. It just… stands out, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Is that a problem?” Rio asked. She actually sounded concerned.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I’m just saying, I think there is no one here like… like </span>
<em>
<span>you.” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio heard Agatha’s voice turn softer at the end of the sentence, hesitant almost.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, well one, </span>
<em>
<span>duh</span>
</em>
<span>, and two, lucky you then.” She winked. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, “I forgot you also have a big ego.” she joked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t, I’m just… very self aware.” Rio said plainly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The car went quiet for a short moment, Rio had so much to ask, to say, but she didn’t know how to begin. Things between the two women were still very fragile. Technically this would be the second day they knew each other in ten years. The nervousness and the tension between them made sense.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, “Can I tell you a secret? But you have to promise not to judge me, I mean, you barely know me,” she teased.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“By this time, I think you know more of my secrets than you should, so sure, I won’t tell if you won't tell.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I took this really hot girl out on a date right, and I was driving a plain sedan at the time, nothing fancy. First date I drove us to the restaurant, afterwards we started making out in the back and it was really uncomfortable, like my neck killed me the next day, and not in a good way. The next time we went on a date, she drove us, but she drove a Range Rover and that turned out to be way better for my neck in the end…” Rio admittedly laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So you’re telling me, you only bought this specific car because it's easier to hookup in. What are you? A fucking teenage boy?” Agatha smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well we’ll see who thanks who later…” she winked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Presumptuous too. Your scorecard is looking very interesting at the moment, Ms. Vidal.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, didn’t know I’d be graded tonight…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, “Ever the teacher, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re here.” Rio said, pulling into an open parking space. she turned off the car and turned to lean on the centre console,  “Do you trust me?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched as the question spun in Agatha’s mind, visibly trying to decide if she could trust her. Rio hoped that Agatha felt that she could. She hasn’t given her any reason not to, but Agatha’s situation might make her more hesitant to let Rio come too close.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I think I do.” She heard Agatha say.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, “I promise you have nothing to worry about.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When they were both out of the car, Rio took Agatha’s hand in hers and led her to the haunted house.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt Rio take her hand and lead her to an old 18th century colonial style building. Agatha strained her eyes to see what was written on the golden plaque on the door. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>The George Hotel</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>What were they doing </span>
<em>
<span>here</span>
</em>
<span>? Agatha thought. “What is this place?” she asked Rio a little confused.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Billy told me about it. Apparently it was the house of a governor in the 18th century. He had a wife who was believed to be a witch in some circles. She was a trained nurse so it was mostly medical stuff, but as you would rightfully know, because of that, the town all believed she was some kind of witch, so then some plague was brought over from another nearby village and people became sick, she was the only person in town with enough medical knowledge to heal them. Some folks didn’t like it, because she was treating everyone, even the slaves and so she was branded a witch. She was hung and now she and her </span>
<em>
<span>sisters</span>
</em>
<span> who they believed were part of her coven, well they apparently haunt the place. You can rent a room in here but it’s mostly a museum for ghost tours.” Rio explained excitedly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re not sleeping in there are we?” Agatha asked nervously. She loved a ghost story about as much as the next person but sleeping in an actual haunted house, no ma’am.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thinking about sharing a bed already?” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, you hornbag,” Agatha said, rolling her eyes and lightly punching her shoulder. She didn’t ignore the fact that as soon as Rio brought it up the images of them in bed started playing in her head. She swallowed hard, “So what? We’re ghost hunting?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“If you’re up for it… I’ll even let you hold my hand when you get scared.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huffed out a ball of air, “Please, I will let </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> hold </span>
<em>
<span>my </span>
</em>
<span>hand, you seem the type to act all brave.” Agatha took a step closer to Rio and whispered in her ear. “I see right through you, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She could feel Rio shiver as the words tickled her ear. Agatha was never bold, but for some reason she felt bolder with this woman in front of her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cleared her throat, “Let’s get inside, tour’s about to start.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>At the reception Rio presented the tickets she purchased online. A small framed woman dressed as a bellboy led them to the first room. Agatha stepped in beside Rio as they followed the woman leading the tour. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>With a monotone voice, the woman started, “Welcome to The George Hotel. Home of Governor Davis and his wife Margaret Davis. My name is Lisa and I’ll be your…” the woman rolled her eyes, “Ghost host.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio snorted, trying to hide her laughter. Agatha pinched her side to make her stop. “So uhm, Lisa?” Agatha asked to get them back on track. “Is this place really haunted?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lisa sighed, “That’s what they say.” She walked them down a passage and turned to open a door. “This was the library, Mrs. Davis was a nurse and studied various types of medicine. In here she treated her patients and studied her craft. She was also an artist in her spare time…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me guess,” Rio interrupted, “She also liked to </span>
<em>
<span>draw blood”</span>
</em>
<span> </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha burst out laughing. “Sorry Lisa,” she said when she saw the woman’s face drop.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I am not getting paid enough for this.” Lisa mumbled. “Ready to move on?” she asked in the same monotone voice.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, we’re sorry, please carry on.” Agatha said embarrassed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They were led to the next room. A grand dining room with low lighting and a long dining table set for dinner. “The governor held many dinner parties in this room. After Mrs. Davis was hung, it was believed that she would haunt the room and disrupt the dinners. Her accusers were acquaintances of the governor.” Lisa took them around the room and stopped at a painting of the Governor and his wife. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, she was a fox!” Rio said, “The governor really lucked out.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Keep it in your pants, Romeo.” She whispered to Rio, who let out a laugh. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know ‘em when I see ‘em, babe” she winked at Agatha and turned to Lisa. “Is she here now?” she asked, trying to be serious. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You never know, ma’am, she might be…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly the lights flickered and Agatha felt Rio jump closer to her. “Scared already?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, just… I’m fine.” Rio said. “Lisa, is it? Take us to where the real action is. Show me the ghosts.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure thing,” she deadpanned.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They were led up a dimly lit staircase that creaked as they climbed higher and stopped at the landing staring down a long corridor lined with dark carpets and wood panel walls with mysterious closed doors on both sides of the corridor.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Now </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> is more like it.” Rio said excitedly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt slightly uneasy. The passage reminded her too much of the low budget hotel safe house she was held in during the trial. Suddenly the fear and loneliness she suppressed since then felt like it was starting to resurface. She shifted her balance from one foot to another, trying to hide her unease. Lisa was still explaining something about the rooms. Rio seemed to notice her sudden change in demeanor. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you okay?” She asked, genuinely concerned.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t want to spoil their evening, “Yeah, yeah, all good.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at her with an unreadable expression. “Actually Lisa, you did it. Consider us thoroughly scared. Long scary corridors, not my thing. We’ll be sure to leave a tip and a great review on our way out. You were great by the way.” She grabbed Agatha’s hand and pulled her towards the stairs to get out of the house. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt herself shaking when they finally stopped on the sidewalk. “Shit, I am sorry. I should’ve known better than bringing you here.” Rio said, rubbing Agatha’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No I am sorry, this is stupid, it wasn’t even that scary.” Agatha laughed. Her face dropped suddenly. “It just looked exactly like the safe house. It’s dumb, I know and…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not dumb, Agatha. I get it, your whole life changed and I am sorry that I took you straight back to that feeling, it must have been really scary.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared up at the building. From the outside it looked like any other building, nothing but brick and mortar and yet it felt like a portal. A rearview mirror to her past self she almost forgot about if it wasn’t for the events of the past two days. “I’m starving,” she said, trying to change the subject and salvage the date.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, let’s go, the restaurant is right there.” Rio pointed her finger down the street.</span>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll have the Galbi and the Samgyeopsal with the Ssamjang and the mixed Banchan. Annnnd let’s get two orders of the jeon.” Rio said to the waiter. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The waiter left to put in their order and Rio took a sip of her soda, smiling nervously at Agatha. The events at the haunted house were still replaying in her head. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What did you just order?” Agatha asked, sipping on the straw in her drink.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Short rib, and pork belly with pancakes and some sides. It’s a good intro to Korean BBQ if you haven’t tried it yet, plus Billy recommended it.” Rio admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, he really impressed you that much? Maybe I will add a grade to his next paper.” Agatha smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Look I had like half a day to come up with something to woo you, and I thought I needed the help, I would deduct a few points for the haunted house if I were you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t that bad. And he doesn’t know about that part of my life, so he gets a pass.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” Rio started hesitantly, “If I had known that you were going through all of that all alone, I think I would have come to find you.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed shyly, “Don’t say that.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No really, something about you, about that night. It has always stayed with me. I had this feeling that I shouldn’t have let you… go.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha and saw her stare back with an unreadable expression. “I meant to say, that I didn’t feel like we were done, you know?” Rio said, trying to hide her nerves. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I feel the same way actually.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the date they spent sharing stories about their past and about things that happened in the ten years that passed since that night. Rio felt Agatha hold back here and there, obviously still a bit hesitant about why she could trust Rio with, but overall they talked about anything and everything that came up. The food was also amazing and Rio made a mental note to thank Billy for suggesting the place. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paid for their meal and walked Agatha back to the car. “Ready to head back?” she asked Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Agatha said softly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened the car door for her and closed the door when she climbed in. Rio walked around the front of the car and climbed into the driver's side. A small flash caught her eye, and she stopped for a moment to see where it came from. She didn’t see anything out of place and started the car. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As they drove off, Rio felt a strange feeling in her stomach. She tried to ignore it as they drove, keeping an eye on her rear view mirror to make sure that no one was following them. The road was clear, but she still couldn’t help the feeling she had building in her stomach that something was off. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re quiet.” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh sorry, I don’t like driving at night, so I guess I am just concentrating.” Rio lied. “Would you maybe want to stop at Tony’s for a drink?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Honestly, I think I still have a hangover from last night, but I do have ice cream at home? Salted caramel.” Agatha admitted shyly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Deal!” Rio said, smiling at Agatha. She glanced in the rearview mirror again, nothing. Maybe she was just paranoid. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They pulled into Agatha’s driveway and Rio turned off the car. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m really sorry about the haunted house, but I really did have a good time.” She said, turning to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No I am sorry for freaking out, I really enjoyed the date, Rio, and I hope you know that. It was… fun.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A comfortable silence fell over them. Rio took Agatha’s hand. “Long overdue, really.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio locked eyes with Agatha, she could drown in the blue pools staring back at her and what a way to go, she thought. Lost in thought, she heard Agatha ask, “How about that salted caramel?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Sitting in Agatha’s living room on her plush sofa, Rio stared at Agatha as she ate her salted caramel ice cream while telling her some story about one of the kids in her class. Rio still saw the flash in her mind. It could have been anything. A kid taking a photo for their Instagram, a reflection of a passing car’s lights, a spark, fuck, even a shooting star, but what if it wasn’t?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So, when are you heading back?” Agatha suddenly asked. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Rio asked, startled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“To Philly? You probably have to go back soon?” Agatha looked down at her hands fidgeting with the bowl in her lap.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh right, yeah, I guess I do have to get back. Probably tomorrow.” She looked at Agatha. She almost wished she hadn’t said it. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, well that’s… tomorrow.” Agatha said, quietly. Rio felt the distance between them. Suddenly the few feet they had between them felt further than the three and a half hours it took her to get here yesterday.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, but I am here now.” She said hopeful.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s face lit up a bit. “Yeah…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood up and took her and Agatha’s bowls to the kitchen. She walked back to where Agatha sat and hunched in front of her, placing her hands over Agatha’s. “I am really glad I found you again.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha, suddenly her eyes glistened with tears. Rio stood up slightly and leaned in slowly, giving Agatha time to push her away. They were almost a breath away. Rio gently lifted her hand up to Agatha’s face to wipe away a tear. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes and Rio cupped her cheek, and softly kissed her. Their lips met for a second before she pulled away, but before she could, she felt Agatha grab at her waist and pulled her onto her lap. Rio huffed as she landed, straddling her thighs. Startled, she looked at Agatha. Her eyes deepened and Rio felt the familiar pull. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Kiss me,” Agatha whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Without any hesitation, Rio moved closer and kissed Agatha. Nothing has ever felt like this kiss, it was a kiss that felt too long overdue and not entirely enough at the same time. She licked at her lips asking to deepen the kiss and Agatha opened her mouth. Agatha’s mouth felt warm and she tasted the lingering salted caramel. Her new favorite flavor, she decided. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A soft moan fell from her lips, and she felt Agatha react to the sound, pulling her closer by her hips, causing a shiver down Rio’s spine as she felt herself grind on Agatha’s thighs. Rio thread her fingers through Agatha’s hair, earning a moan from the woman she was passionately kissing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you’re going to have to stop me now,” Rio warned, she was getting worked up and Agatha felt like a drug she swore off and finally relapsed on. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, don't stop,” she heard Agatha breathe out.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The words left Agatha’s mouth and Rio felt like a tightly coiled spring finally let free to launch forward. She pulled Agatha even closer and furiously grabbed at her back and neck. She was drowning in their kiss and she never felt more alive. Her body was on fire and every part of Rio’s body where Agatha touched came alive. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head fell back onto the sofa and Rio grabbed the opportunity to leave a hot trail of kisses down her neck, tugging at her own sweater to start to get rid of her clothes. She threw the garment to the side and pulled at Agatha’s blouse to gain more access to her skin. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just rip it,” she heard Agatha say breathlessly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and did just that, buttons flew across the room and Rio was met with the most gorgeous sight she’d ever seen. Agatha stared at her with hooded eyes, panting. Her chest moved up and down as she breathed and Rio felt her heartbeat match the rhythm perfectly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You are unbelievably beautiful right now.” She said, slowly moving her hands from Agatha’s neck down to her navel. Agatha smiled shyly and pulled Rio’s lips back to hers. She kissed her slower than earlier, no less passionately but with more intensity. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha whispered, “Take me to the bedroom… now.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused her hands where they were pulling at Agatha’s hips. She kissed her once more before getting up from her lap and pulled her up with her. “Lead the way, gorgeous.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared up at Rio. Her heart pounding in her chest, loud enough to almost drown out the words Rio spoke as she pulled her up from the sofa, “Lead the way, gorgeous.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The short distance to her bedroom felt almost too far now. Halfway there she stopped and pushed Rio up against the wall, her hands immediately pulling at Rio’s belt to loosen it. When the belt was free she yanked it off Rio’s hips and began undoing the button of her jeans kissing along her clavicle back up her throat to meet Rio’s lips again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a moan as Agatha pushed her jeans down, her hands cupped her ass and pulled her closer. Agatha felt Rio push off the wall, flipping them to switch their places. With the strong grip of one hand, she felt Rio hold her hands above her head while the other cupped her breast over her bra as she kissed her below her earlobe, sending goosebumps all over her body. “</span>
<em>
<span>Fucccck, Rio…” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha moaned as she felt Rio’s thigh pressed up against her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled away suddenly and looked Agatha straight in the eyes. “The way you are saying my name right now…” she kissed her again, “I almost can’t stand it.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned, “There’s more where that came from if you let me off this wall.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You started it.” Rio teased. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed off the wall and grabbed Rio’s hands, walking backwards while pulling her into the bedroom. Rio paused when they reached the bed. Agatha gently pulled her closer and kissed her slowly, savoring every soft gasp and feel of the bare skin under her hands. Still not breaking the kiss she pulled her own pants off and moved her hands to unclasp Rio’s bra letting it fall to the side. Rio removed Agatha’s last remaining clothes and pushed her gently onto the bed behind her and crawled over her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled up at Rio, her hair fell forward framing her face and Agatha felt her breath catch in her throat. “Beautiful,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s face turned a shade of red, “Speak for yourself.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed herself up on her elbows to kiss Rio again, feeling their naked bodies touching for the first time. For a moment they only kissed and let their hands roam over each other, feeling and studying every inch, every dip and curve. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A burning trail from Rio’s hands, starting from her neck, over her breast, down her stomach and finally to her wet core. Agatha’s eyes rolled to the back of her head when she felt Rio’s fingers sliding through her. “Oh my </span>
<em>
<span>god” </span>
</em>
<span>she moaned. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled into her mouth as she kissed her again and Agatha moved her hips to feel even more of Rio’s touch. A low groan left her throat when Rio entered her, pushing in slowly. Soft lips were brushing over her nipple as strong fingers were curling perfectly inside of her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her mind spinning and she heard herself mumbling incoherently, moaning with each strong thrust and touch against her clit. She was going to come soon, and as if Rio was reading her mind, she adjusted her hand to let her thumb circle her clit in sync with the thrusts, inevitably sending her over the edge. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her body went stiff and she held onto Rio as tight as she could, probably leaving marks all over her back. With one last scream of Rio’s name she went limp and fell back against the bed as her orgasm ripped through her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her way back up to her lips, “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held her eyes closed, “Uh-huh,” she said, no words were coming to her. She felt she could only communicate in grunts. Her mind was a mess, her body on fire and her breathing rapid.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio placed gentle kisses to her face and ended up back at her lips. Agatha finally opened her eyes and saw Rio smiling down at her. Agatha pushed a lock of hair from Rio’s face and pulled her close to kiss her again. The kiss deepened and Agatha pushed Rio over to straddle her thighs, rocking back and forth every now and then. She was sure Rio could still feel her wet core against her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you need… you need to touch me </span>
<em>
<span>now</span>
</em>
<span>, I… I need you to touch me, please.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the need pulsing through Rio as their bodies moved in sync, warm skin moving over warm skin and hands roaming and touching everything it landed on. She moved her leg over Rio’s and was now only straddling over one thigh, unfolding Rio and spreading her legs. Agatha’s pressed her thigh up against her and she immediately felt the slick warmth on her skin. The sensation ripped through her and she bit the sensitive skin in the crook of Rio’s neck.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A loud gasp fell from Rio’s lips and Agatha felt her head being maneuvered back to Rio’s face. “You bit me,” she said between gasps as Agatha continued to grind her thigh into Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Couldn’t resist, sorry.” She smirked, and kissed her intensely. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved herself lower, kissing her way down and  unintentionally also moving her thigh away from Rio’s center. Rio moaned loudly at the loss of contact, but Agatha made up for it fast when she wasted no time to lick between Rio’s wet folds circling her clit.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Instantly Rio gasped loudly and grabbed at the sheets below. </span>
<em>
<span>“Fuckfuckfuck, baby…fucccck”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hummed in appreciation when she heard the reaction coming from above her, and felt Rio tremble as the vibrations from the sound moved through her. She added two fingers and started pumping in and out while keeping her mouth latched to her clit and almost lost all control when she felt Rio grab onto her hair, grinding herself harder into her face. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>With a loud guttural groan, Rio pushed up against her face one last time, Agatha felt her head being locked between her thighs but she couldn’t care, the sights and the tastes she was experiencing as Rio came undone before her was worth it. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When Rio stilled Agatha crawled back up to lay next to her. She fell down resting her head on Rio’s shoulder and suddenly saw that the woman had a few tears rolling off her face. “Rio! Did I hurt you?” she asked worriedly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, the tears were still rolling down her cheek. “No I ju… fuck, sorry, I have no idea what just happened. I can’t really stop it.” She laughed again, wiping her face.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched her nervously, “Are… are you sure? I didn’t…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, baby,” Rio said cupping her cheeks. “This is new to me too, believe me. I have never… cried after sex. I just… felt… everything all at once. You didn’t do </span>
<em>
<span>anything </span>
</em>
<span>wrong, please believe me. You actually… that was fucking perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed shyly, “I didn’t take you as an emotional lover.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not, fuck. At least I never was… but it looks like you… fucked me into one.” She laughed, wiping the last of her tears away. “But please believe me when I say, I will forever be ruined after this.”</span>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio woke up when she heard the faint familiar sounds of her phone ringing somewhere in the house. She turned her head to the side to see Agatha still fast asleep next to her. Her face was relaxed and the sun that peeked past the curtains in the room was shining slightly on her face illuminating her skin. She almost looked heavenly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled and shook her head and grabbed a robe hanging on the closet door running to where her phone was ringing. “Nat?” She answered in a low whisper. “Its…” she looked at the clock on her phone, “It’s half past six on a fucking Sunday.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Well good morning to you too, Sunshine. Maybe if you answer only one of my fucking texts I wouldn’t have been so worried and let you sleep in, wherever the hell you are. Where are you by the way?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Long story… I’ll be back tomorrow. Just don’t worry about it now. I’m fine, really.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Oh god, did I wake you up from a hookup?” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, well yeah, but it’s not like that exactly. Whatever, I don’t need to explain myself to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Certainly not, but we had a date, remember. Wanda made partner at the firm and there was the dinner party which you promised to attend plus the date I so graciously lined up for you, remember Ashley?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio slapped her forehead, “Fuck, yeah shit. The dinner. Sorry Nat, something… came up.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Who came… up, Rio?” </span>
</em>
<span>She could hear Nat laughing at her own joke.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“None of your business, look I’ll be back tomorrow…” Rio said again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha woke up to an empty bed, it still felt warm from where Rio was sleeping. </span>
<em>
<span>“Fuck…” </span>
</em>
<span>she thought, but then she heard Rio talking softly somewhere in the house, sighing with relief. She was still here. She rolled off the bed and got up. She felt her limbs ache slightly, the night before still lingering in her muscles. She smiled as she quickly threw on an oversized shirt and a pair of shorts. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“…Sorry Nat, something… came up.” </span>
</em>
<span>she heard Rio talking on the phone. She felt awkward and hesitated leaving the bedroom not wanting to intrude on her call. Rio must have dropped whatever plans she had to come to Westview. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When she heard her ending the call she took a breath and walked out the room. Suddenly Rio bumped into her on her way back into the room. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit, sorry.” Rio said awkwardly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed “Sorry, my fault. I’m probably still sleeping.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They stared at each other for a moment. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio said softly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, “Hi.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Hesitating only slightly, Agatha leaned forward to place a soft quick kiss on Rio’s lips. When she stepped back, she saw Rio smiling at her. “Hi.” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You said that already.” Agatha laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, I did.” Rio looked away shyly and pulled her lips between her teeth. Agatha thought she looked adorable. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you want coffee, or tea, or…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Coffee sounds good.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.” Agatha smiled, walking towards the kitchen. She was just about to pass Rio when she felt a hand stopping her. Rio turned her back around and kissed her slowly. Agatha felt her head spin bringing back the memories of the night before. She leaned into the kiss and almost fell forward when Rio pulled back.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I, uh, </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> had a great time with you last night.” Rio smiled, her lips brushing lightly against Agatha’s lips as she spoke. She shivered and was sure Rio could feel her reaction to the kiss affecting her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too.” Agatha replied with a bright smile.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha proceeded to make some coffee for the two of them while Rio got dressed into something less, robe-y, as she put it. Agatha stared out the kitchen window while she waited for the coffee to brew. She loved her garden, but the autumn weather was harsh on her flower beds. She'll have to cover them for the winter, she reminded herself. A knock on the front door startled heroit of her daydream and she walked to see who it was. Alice. And Jen. Great, she would never hear the end of this…</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Al, Jen.” she greeted, trying to sound awake enough.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, you look… tired,” Jen said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s barely 7am Jen, have a heart.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me about it,” Alice said, yawning. “Do I smell coffee?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice walked past Agatha straight to the kitchen. “Help yourself…” she called after her. Alice always had a way of making herself very comfortable in Agatha’s house. This was nothing new.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Come in,” she gestured to Jen, who took a seat in the lounge. “Do you want coffee?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No thanks, we stopped for coffee on the way here, but Alice needs an IV of caffeine some days. I’m good for now.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, this was true. Alice probably consisted of half coffee, half Alice by 12pm on a daily basis, the percentage only increasing as the day went on.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio emerged from Agatha’s room, dressed in what was clearly not her clothing, earning a knowing look from their guests.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, I see why you are so tired.” Alice joked with a wink. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “Keep your comments to yourself, officer.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio plopped on the sofa next to Jen, “Why are you two here so early?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Al has an update for Ags and it apparently couldn’t be communicated over the phone, so here we are, basking in </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> morning after glory.” Jen said feigning sarcasm.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha brought Rio her coffee and Alice followed behind her to the living room. Rio stood up to move to sit next to Agatha allowing Alice to move next to Jen. Agatha smiled at the four of them, two couples, two colliding worlds.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So what’s the update that couldn’t be done over the phone?” Agatha asked Alice, narrowing her eyes suspiciously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s… sensitive.” Alice said, her eyes gesturing to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up on the look, Alice was a terrible poker player, and an even worse liar, her face was about as subtle as a bomb. “It’s fine Alice, just tell me.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, so you remember my contact in the prison system?” Alice asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” Agatha replied nervously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“They aren’t entirely sure when, but RB is being moved, his lawyers cut him some kind of deal and reduced his sentence, he’ll be out at the end of the month on good behavior.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Good behavior?” Agatha yelled, “He murdered two people and god knows what else, and he gets off just after ten years? How the fuck is that justice?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I have no clue, Agatha. But for now that just means we have to be more careful and more alert. If he gets out he’ll obviously still have parole conditions, but his reach will be way less limited than it was when he was still in prison.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I am already </span>
<em>
<span>here</span>
</em>
<span> Alice, hiding in the middle of fucking nowhere, New Jersey.” Agatha felt herself shaking. “What else… Will they move me again?” she asked, suddenly realizing that this could mean uprooting her life again, this time Nicky’s too.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, let's not get carried away. We’re still confident that there is no way he can link you to your old life. Agnes O’Connor is basically dead on paper, and </span>
<em>
<span>you </span>
</em>
<span>and your life here is not traceable back to your old life. Unless he has someone on the inside, there shouldn’t be any way he can get to you or Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck.” Agatha said, her head falling into her hands. She felt Rio move closer, her hand resting on her thigh, somewhat steadying her. “I’m never going to be free, am I? I am always going to have to look behind my back.” she said quietly, tears welling up in her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The room fell silent. The weight of her words hung thick in the air. If she left Nicky with Maria he would be safe, he’d have a safe, secure and carefree life without her. She could move to another country, checking in when it was safe again. But she’d miss him growing up. Was it selfish of her to stay here and hope that they stay hidden forever. No one is that hard to find. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her thoughts bubbled up in her chest and she started crying. She felt Rio pull her closer, allowing her to cry into her embrace.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Could you give us a minute?” Rio asked Alice and Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They silently agreed and stepped out onto the patio in the backyard.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, baby, we’ll figure this out, okay? There has to be some w…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, you don’t need this. You have a life. One without all of… </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>. You don’t need to live like this, with your life in danger, constantly watching your back” Agatha said, still crying. “I can’t bring you into my fucked up nightmare.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, look at me.” she pulled her chin up. “I get to choose where I want to be, don’t push me away Agatha, please.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked into Rio’s dark eyes. All she saw was hope, obviously misplaced, but hope that Agatha was brave enough to have Rio stay by her side through this.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I … I can’t Rio. You barely know me. I can’t possibly expect you to be a part of this. My life is one thing, but I will not put you or Nicky in any more danger.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha suddenly stood up and basically ran into her room, locking the door behind her. She heard Rio run up behind her and knock on the door to be let in. “Agatha please… whatever it is you are doing, please let’s just talk about it first. Baby, we can figure this out, please.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha cried soundlessly, listening to the woman she just spent the most amazing night with, pleading with her to be let in, into her room and into her life. She stood in front of her closet trying to block out the sounds coming from outside her bedroom door. She needed to get away from here, leave her life as she knew it, again. Start over somewhere else, away from danger and away from those she will inadvertently pull into Ralph Bohner’s crossfires.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The banging on her door didn’t stop, if anything, she heard the amount of hands knocking increase, Alice and Jen were there too now. Agatha slid down the wall and dropped her head on her arms as she held herself. “Just… go away please. All of you.” She yelled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I will kick down this fucking door.” she heard Alice yell.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Finally the banging stopped. She lifted her head and let it rest against the wall behind her. She closed her eyes and tried to calm herself. With a big bang, Alice and Rio burst through the doors, splinters flew through the air as if it was all happening in slow motion. She held her arm over her face to hide from the debris.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck?” she yelled out. “Look at my fucking door!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Rio stood in front of her, both heavily breathing. “Agatha, what are you </span>
<em>
<span>doing?” </span>
</em>
<span>Alice asked with her hands resting on her hips. “Are you packing? Going on a fucking holiday? You can’t just leave and run away from this Agatha, what about Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Why not, Alice? I’ve had to do it before, what is so different now?” she spat through the tears.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Because…” Rio and Alice said in unison looking at each other, startled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Because this time you have us, Agatha.” Jen chimed in, “And we’re not letting you go through this alone, not again.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up at the three women in front of her. Jen, her old friend. Alice, her closest friend. And Rio, her… she wasn’t getting into that now. </span>
<em>
<span>It’s been two days, calm down… </span>
</em>
<span>she thought. Her eyes filled back up with tears. Maybe they were right, maybe this time she wouldn’t be alone.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Alice moved to sit beside her, each flanking her and holding her while she cried. “We’ll figure this out, Ags” Rio said, kissing her temple.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, just let us help you.” Alice said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to Alice and smiled, then to Rio, “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.” Rio sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The morning was a lot to process. First, Rio woke up next to Agatha after an amazing date. Second, their friends walked in on them in their morning after get-ups after said amazing date and even more amazing night of passionate sex. Third, Agatha finds out that the man who threatened and uprooted her life was getting out and she was potentially back in danger. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Now, one unfortunate broken door later, Agatha has finally calmed down slightly, not running away and showering, while Jen, Alice and Rio sat in the living room in a loaded silence. “Alice, I have to tell you something that happened last night. I didn’t know if I should bring it up, but given the circumstances, it may be… relevant.” Rio said after a while.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, hit me.” Alice said, leaning forward in her seat.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span> “Last night we went to Eastview for dinner, when we left the restaurant and walked to the car, I saw a flash go off. It could have been anything really, but what if someone recognized her and took photos?” Rio said quietly. She didn’t want Agatha to know just yet, in case it wasn’t a big deal.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Did anyone follow you?” Alice asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Not that I noticed. I kept looking behind us when we drove home. I didn’t see a car or anything else. I may just be paranoid now.” Rio said, leaning back onto the sofa.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well now that we know what we know, I think we are beyond paranoia, we’ll have to be way more careful. RB isn’t out yet, but he’s always had guys on the outside.” Alice said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“But what are the chances?” Jen asked. “Ten years have passed with, I am assuming, no suspicious activity, then when we show up…” she gestured between herself and Rio, “...and someone’s out there taking photos.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, it feels unlikely, but I don’t want to take chances. Not with Ms. Runaway-Bride in there.” Alice motioned to the main bedroom where Agatha was showering. “Let’s keep this between us for now. I’ll get my guys to scope out the area. See if anyone doesn’t… belong.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think we should tell Wanda and Lilia?” Jen asked hesitantly. “Lilia for one would want to know. Agatha was like a daughter to her. And maybe she might be able to help. She has people everywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think it is a good idea? She was Evanora’s law partner. What if they still had contact?” Rio asked. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t I just reach out and ask if she’s heard anything from Agnes. You know, I could be asking because I wanted to reach out and possibly make amends.” Jen suggested.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think she’ll tell you anything?” Alice asked. “If she was in on it in any way, she’ll hold her cards very close to her chest.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio heard Agatha return to the living room, her hair was still damp, and she was wearing comfortable clothes. She looked so vulnerable and Rio wanted to run up to her and hold her until she felt safe again, but she thought Agatha might need some space.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey.” Agatha said with a quiet wave.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Ags.” Jen greeted back. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m going to call Nicky.” Agatha said, holding her phone up and walking out onto the patio. Rio watched her intently, “I’m not running, I promise.” she smiled at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay,” Rio answered, still keeping her focus on Agatha as she walked out onto the patio and pulled the door closed behind her. She watched her sit down on a lounger and make a call.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I think you should call Lilia,” Rio said, turning back to their conversation.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen got up and walked out of the front door to make the call. Rio met Lilia once at Wanda and Nat’s wedding, the woman was stern and a little kooky but she had a maternal feel about her, and if she was like a mother figure to Agatha, maybe this would be the right call. Jen just had to ask the right questions in such a way as to not raise suspicion. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Rio sat in silence. Both their </span>
<em>
<span>girls</span>
</em>
<span> on their phones, one checking in on her son, the other checking in on a lost friend. This almost seemed funny to Rio. “So uhm…” Rio tried to break the awkward silence, “how long have you and Jen been together?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice seemed almost shocked at the question. “Oh uhm, I guess it’s only been a few months, really.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hasn’t seen Jen since the wedding, and that was years ago. She wouldn’t have known if Jen was seeing someone anyway, since they weren’t especially close to begin with. Another awkward silence hung in the room. The two of them tried to not make eye contact. This was excruciatingly awkward.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Still new, huh.” Rio tried again. </span>
<em>
<span>God this was dumb</span>
</em>
<span>, she thought. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smiled, “Longer than whatever is happening here. Although you two didn’t waste any time trying to catch up on lost time.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, Alice wasn’t holding back. She liked that, maybe they could actually be friends. “Yeah…” she glanced at the patio where Agatha was still on the phone. “We have a lot of that to do.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice followed her eyes to Agatha. “Do you think she’ll be okay?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha has always been strong and so fucking stubborn, she’s scared now because this is the first time we’ve had this close of a call. She seemed to have adjusted and moved on, till now. This is the first time I’ve seen her this… uncertain.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t help but feel like her being here was adding to Agatha’s current state. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Even though her ground feels shaky now, she’s different with you.” Alice said, smiling at Rio. “She’s far from okay, but I can almost see her being more… grounded. She’s never really had that.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“When she moved here, she was angry, like a poked bear the whole time. Untouchable. Then after the first year it felt like she started accepting that this was her life, then came Maria, then Nicky, and she was finally looking happy again, but still not fully herself. I think there were glimpses but she never really let herself have something real. That’s probably why she and Maria never worked out, there was always a part of Agatha that she could never share with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It made sense. No matter how much she thought she could trust someone, that part of her life which she had to hide away was probably not something she thought she could ever really share. Did anyone really know Agatha? Rio knew her before, briefly, but she knew a part of Agatha that almost no one else knew of.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She never told her wife anything?” Rio asked, perplexed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope, she stuck to her made up life, her made up past life, everything. No one here except me knows the truth.” Alice shifted in her seat. Rio was happy that Agatha at least had Alice, someone who she didn’t have to hide from.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That must have been so hard for her.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It still is, but like I said, she seems…lighter. Scared yes, but it’s like she can breathe more.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>If that was what Rio’s purpose here would be, she was happy to be here. She felt she cared enough about her to want to try and be here for Agatha, even if their relationship wasn’t as solid yet. Agatha deserved someone in her corner and she wanted to be that for her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held the phone in her hand, staring at the smiling hot dog photo. Her son, her only tangible tether to this life here in Westview. Her life before him made no sense, and once he was placed in her arms for the first time, her life started over. She had something to live for again, Agatha suddenly had meaning again. Talking with Nicky, Agatha realized that she couldn’t just up and leave. Despite her thinking that it would be best to just disappear, her heart wouldn’t stand it. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She stared through the glass of the sliding door, taking in the group of people in the living room. Alice, her best friend and protector. Jen and Rio, two of the people she was forced to forget, somehow back in her life. Through the glass she saw the three of them in deep conversation, obviously about her and the impossible situation she was in now. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She got up slowly and opened the door. The conversation went quiet and all eyes fell onto her, trying to sum her up, to gauge her next move.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“See, I said I wasn’t running.” she joked, smiling shyly at them. No one laughed.</span>

<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After the eventful morning Agatha felt mostly embarrassed. Rio had taken her on an amazing date and they spent the night together in absolute bliss. Nothing could prepare her for the flood of feelings she experienced as they finally came together after ten years of wondering what could have been. It was perfect, nothing she had ever imagined or expected. And then a few hours later her world came crashing down on her. The night before feeling like a lifetime ago.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Jen left soon after Agatha came back inside earlier. Now, left with the remnants of the morning’s events, Rio sat quietly next to her in silence. Agatha’s thoughts were running at a hundred miles per hour. Rio felt too close, too real all of a sudden and Agatha couldn’t find the words to break the impossible tension hanging in the air.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I could g… Do you need me to leave?” Rio asked quietly, avoiding Agatha’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a pain in her chest. Rio didn’t deserve this. “I…” Agatha slowly took Rio’s hand in hers. “You probably should, but I don’t think I want you to… go.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let her eyes look to the side, nervously trying to gauge her reaction. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I could stay a while, if you wanted. I need to be back tomorrow morning but I could still… be here now, if you need me to.” Rio intertwined their fingers. Agatha looked down at their hands and smiled, tears fighting to stay intact.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to face Rio, “I’m sorry. About all of this.” she sighed, “Last night was… perfect. And now…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Now what?” Agatha looked into her eyes, the dark brown orbs burning a hole in her heart. “Now what, Agatha?” Rio asked again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t give you what you want.” Agatha said softly, “What you deserve.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw her words hitting Rio and saw her expression changing from hope to hurt. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, don’t tell me what I want.” she said, quietly. Agatha felt a soft hand cupping her face and the tears broke through their barriers.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio…” she sighed, “It’s not… safe.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled Agatha close, kissing her so soft, Agatha almost didn’t feel it. “For now, it’s as safe as it’s going to be, and to be honest, now that I have finally found you, I am not ready to let you go.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You barely know me, Rio.“ she said through the tears.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Then let me.” Rio said, lifting her chin up to look into her eyes again. “Let me </span>
<em>
<span>know</span>
</em>
<span> you Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt herself losing all control, her tears flowing freely as she rested her head on Rio’s chest. She felt strong arms fold over her back and pull her close. For the first time in what felt like forever, Agatha let herself be held as she let go. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Holding on to Agatha as she cried, Rio felt her heart ache for the woman. She was right, she didn’t know anything about Agatha really. They’ve shared what they could in the little time they had spent together in the last few days, but the instant familiarity she felt with her was undeniable. It was too soon for </span>
<em>
<span>love</span>
</em>
<span>, sure, but their connection was deep and Rio felt herself already caring deeply for Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen, Agatha, I don’t know what we should be doing, but I want to be here for you. In whatever capacity you want me to.” She said, rubbing her hands gently over Agatha’s back. “You aren’t going to go through this alone.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back. Rio saw the wet patch of tears Agatha left against her shoulder. “Rio, I can't ask you to do that. You have a life, a job… and it’s not here in Westview. And I can’t go back to Philadelphia.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a moment to consider Agatha. She watched her pull away. “I know that, but we’ll figure it out. I want to figure this out with you, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at her, Rio’s heart breaking at the sight. “Okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay.” Rio smiled back. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio thought about what Jen had told them after she spoke to Lilia. Nothing groundbreaking, but Jen said that Lilia was vague enough to let her think that she knew </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span>. Of course if Lilia knew anything about where Agnes was she wouldn’t say, if she was like a mother to Agnes hopefully that meant that she would know to keep her location secret. The three of them agreed that Rio would try to meet with Lilia to get more from her when she was back home. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“When do you leave?” Agatha asked hesitantly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t want to leave, but she left in such a hurry on Friday afternoon, that there was no way she would be able to stay longer even if she wanted to. “I need to sort a few things out at the office and there are other… things I need to do, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t want to stay. I would like to come back here, soon, if that is something you would want?” Rio looked at Agatha, hoping that it didn’t come across as dismissive. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and Rio felt her heart tugging in her chest. “I would love that.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*********</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked Rio to her car, it was already getting dark and Rio still had about three hours of driving to do. The silence between them felt charged, and Agatha couldn’t help but remember that same charged silence that sat between them in the Uber ten years ago, only this time, she felt less uncertain.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well,” Rio said, swaying backwards on her heels. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please let me know when you are safe.” Agatha interjected.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, Agatha already missed that perfect sound. “I promise I will text you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha scoffed, “Promise me you will stay away from alleys and drug gangs?” She joked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry. If I ever need witness protection, I’ll be sure to request transfer to Westview.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed at that. She moved closer to Rio and pulled her into a tight hug. “I don’t need </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> disappearing on me this time.” Her nose was nuzzled into Rio’s hair and Agatha tried to commit Rio’s smell to memory, just in case. She pulled away slightly and rested her forehead on Rio’s. “See you soon, Rio.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Soon Agatha,” Rio said before kissing Agatha. Agatha felt herself melting into Rio’s arms as she kissed her, but finally stopping herself from losing all control, she took a step back and watched Rio climb into the car. She gave her a small wave as the car reversed and disappeared down the road.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She stood frozen in the driveway, nothing felt the same as it was before. Like before, her life was changing without any chance of stopping it.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Agatha,” Dottie, her nosy neighbor, greeted out of nowhere. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She was head of the PTA at school, head of the neighborhood HOA and a real pain in Agatha’s ass.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi, Dottie…” Agatha greeted back with a fake smile.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Your friend has a nice car.” she said grinning, the same grin she put on when her kid got the wrong role in the school play. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t respond. She kept her fake smile on and crossed her arms slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s not from here, I take?” Dottie asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No she’s… not.” Agatha finally answered. “I uhm… I left the oven on, excus…” Agatha started to turn.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s just, no one here has </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span> kind of money, is all.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Is there anything I can help you with, Dottie?” Agatha asked, turning back towards her getting more frustrated.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Actually, now that you’re asking...”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Here we go,</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha thought. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I couldn’t help but notice that you’ve had quite the social life this weekend. Good for you Ms. Harkness.” She winked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>What the fuck? Does this woman ever mind her own business?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, uhm, they’re… friends from college, so…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, that explains why they didn’t look familiar, except for Officer Wu of course.” she giggled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, narrowing her eyes. “If that’s all, Dottie, I think I need to get back to the clothes iron, don’t want to burn down the house.” She said turning around.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oven.” Dottie said quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha asked, confused.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You said you left the oven on.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Right. Well it’s been quite the weekend as you’ve obviously seen,” Agatha joked, “Maybe I’ll just check on both.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She turned around and hurried into the house to escape Dottie’s sudden interrogation. </span>
<em>
<span>Fucking nosy bitch</span>
</em>
<span>, she mumbled closing the door behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The house suddenly felt empty again. It usually was when Nicky was with Maria but tonight, after everything that happened it felt even more so. She walked to the kitchen to get a cup of coffee and went to her study, she might as well get some work done before school tomorrow and the papers weren’t going to grade themselves.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The drive home passed in a blur. Rio’s mind was everywhere and Agatha’s kiss still burned on her lips. She already felt herself missing Agatha, the one person she never thought she’d see again, but god was she glad she did. Their reunion started off shaky but it felt so natural to pick up where they left off ten years ago. And the night before after the date, Rio didn’t expect it to be…</span>
<em>
<span>that. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>In all her life has she never fucking </span>
<em>
<span>cried</span>
</em>
<span> after sex. Not even when she was still dating Emma, the only girl she ever thought she loved. But with Agatha it was different. From the start. Their connection was more than sexual or even emotional. It felt… </span>
<em>
<span>inevitable</span>
</em>
<span>.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio shook her head, she still had an hour left to drive and thinking about Agatha and how their bodies fit together just right was making it hard for her not to turn the car right back around to Westview. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><span>To keep her mind occupied with anything else she thought about “</span><em><span>Project Darkhold</span></em><span>” as Alice named the group chat Jen and Alice now added her to. </span><em><span>Project</span></em> <em><span>Darkhold, </span></em><span>the most dramatic name for a secret project Rio has ever heard of, was all about keeping Agatha safe, and as Alice excitedly explained, </span><em><span>in the dark. </span></em><span>For now.</span></p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She hated group chats, but she saw the value of keeping each other informed on what they could find about Lilia, RB and whatever else they were looking for. She felt bad for keeping this from Agatha, but they all decided that it would be best for now, in case she decides to make a run for it again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice was going to speak to her contacts in the police force who may be able to help with RB’s current location and his parole requirements. Jen was coming to Philadelphia to meet up with Rio later in the week to “visit” so they could go meet Lilia together as “old friends” of Agnes trying to reconnect.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>This was barely a plan, but it was something. In the meantime, Alice would be keeping to her regular routine of visiting and checking in on Agatha. When they had something real to share with her, they agreed to do so immediately. Agatha was going to hate this…</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled into the underground garage of her apartment building. She stretched as she climbed out and walked to the elevator to get to her apartment. She climbed into the elevator car and stared at herself in the mirror. Suddenly she noticed a small purple bruise on her neck, right below her jawline. </span>
<em>
<span>A fucking hickey! </span>
</em>
<span>She pulled out her phone and took a photo of the bruise. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: I went to Westview and all I got was this fucking hickey</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She attached the photo to the text.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha: Sure it’s a hickey? Looks more like you bumped into something.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: I think I would know if I did. I distinctly remember you paying a lot of attention to that particular spot last night</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The elevator stopped on her floor and she walked to open her apartment door. She threw her bag in her room and fell onto the bed, staring at her phone as she waited for Agatha’s next text.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha: And I distinctly remember paying a lot of attention to a few other spots as well… </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio ran to the mirror and pulled up her sweater revealing the trail of bites and hickeys left by Agatha. How did she not notice them this morning? She was </span>
<em>
<span>covered</span>
</em>
<span> in hickeys.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: You left me looking like a fucking leopard. Just found the others. You are lucky it’s cold out. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha: Well, I did feel lucky when my mouth was all over you last night. Now, not so much…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: I was the lucky one. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: I promise to see you soon. Is it too much to say that I already miss you?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio saw Agatha’s three dots pop up and disappear, and again… </span>
<em>
<span>Shit, too much, </span>
</em>
<span>she thought. Too late now, she already said it.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha: Honestly, I think I’ve always missed you, Rio…</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared at the message. Somehow she felt it too. She’s always missed something or someone and now she knew. It was </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> she missed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Me too. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio fell back onto her pillows and stared up at the ceiling. She smiled and turned to her side looking at the moon through her curtains, picturing Agatha’s blue eyes looking back at her and eventually falling asleep.</span>

<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat at her desk in her classroom. She had a free period before the next class would start, so she continued with the last papers she still had left to grade. The weekend put her a bit behind schedule. She heard a knock on the door. Not looking up from the papers in front of her she answered, “Busy…”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Ags,” she heard Maria say. She looked up and saw her leaning against the doorframe.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Maria, sorry. Come in.” Agatha said, taking off her glasses and putting them down on the stack of papers.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry for interrupting.” Maria walked to sit in one of the chairs in front of her desk. “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat back in her chair. Why wouldn’t she be? “Yeah? Why are you asking?”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky said you were </span>
<em>
<span>weird </span>
</em>
<span>when you spoke to him Saturday. Weirder than usual for this time of year.” Oh, the phone call. Nicky was always intuitive and must have picked up on something. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha remembered the part of her backstory explaining her being </span>
<em>
<span>weird </span>
</em>
<span>this time of year. She wanted to relocate after her estranged parents suddenly died. Vague enough to make it believable and also to explain why she didn’t have any family members to invite to their wedding.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh…” Agatha replied quietly. “Yeah. Sorry, I didn’t mean to be </span>
<em>
<span>weird.” </span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You can tell me if something is wrong, you know. We are… friends.” Maria said smiling. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha always loved that about Maria. Even though their marriage never worked out, Maria was still a good friend, understanding and caring. Agatha put her through hell, and Maria never held that against her.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m fine really. I had a bit too much to drink Friday night and I had a hell of a hangover.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I heard I missed a big show at Tony’s.” Maria teased.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha covered her face in embarrassment. “Oh god, I told Jen and Al to keep me away from the karaoke machine.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Jen?” Maria asked.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Shit… </span>
</em>
<span>“Uh yeah, Al’s new girlfriend.” Agatha tried to correct herself.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I didn’t know she was dating. I don’t know why, but I thought you two were secretly a thing…”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Me and Alice?” Agatha laughed. “Never happening.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Why? She’s always around and I just assumed you and her were like… closer.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Billy appeared at the door, peeking his head through the door. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I thought that other cool mystery woman was going to ask you out, Ms. H.” he interrupted.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Billy,” Agatha said, her eyes almost popping out of her head. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria looked at Agatha and stood up walking towards the door again. “Well, I guess I was wrong about a lot of things. Anyway Ags, come to dinner tonight, I’m making your favorite and Nicky would love to see you.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha agreed and waved her goodbye as Billy sat down on the chair where Maria got up from a few seconds ago.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you have a class to get to Teen?” She asked him with a raised brow.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I have a pass for PE. I sprained my ankle at work.” He said lifting his leg to show a bandage wrapped around his clearly uninjured leg.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You work in a coffee shop,” she said, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a lot more dangerous than you think, Ms. H.” He winked. “Once, I tripped over a cup holder on the floor and nearly threw a hot to go cup right in Mrs. Davis’ face.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, she knew he always had some excuse for getting out of PE. “Right. Some day you’re going to have to go, you know.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, but today is rope climbing day and I have a terrible fear of heights.” He said, “Soooo?” He asked, leaning forward.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” She replied with a straight face.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything exciting happen over the weekend?” he asked.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“None of your business, kid. Now scram,” she said, shaking her hand at him. “I can still drop your grade for that haunted house, you know.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Billy suddenly grinned and shot up from the chair. “I knew it! You can thank me later, Ms. H…” he sang, scrambling to the desk in the back.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shook her head, “You are far too nosy for your own good, kid.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Later that night Agatha found herself sitting in Maria’s dining room flanked by Nicky and Melinda. They’d just finished dinner, and were enjoying the last of their drinks before Nicky had to go to bed. This had become a regular occurrence, when Nicky was at Maria’s she’d come for dinner sometime in the week. Maria always felt Agatha spent too much time on her own.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nic,” Maria said, “Time for bed, sweetie.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Moooom,” he protested. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed his head and kissed him before saying, “Listen to your mom, baby.” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky sighed and hugged Agatha, turning to Melinda to hug her good night too. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be there in a minute to tuck you in.” Maria said as she watched him walk up the stairs to his bedroom.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Melinda cleared the dining table while Maria was with Nicky. “Maria tells me you went on a date?” Melinda asked. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They’ve never been </span>
<em>
<span>best</span>
</em>
<span> friends but Agatha actually liked Melinda. She was serious and a straight to the point kind of person and Agatha respected that, she always knew where she stood with her and she also appreciated that she treated Maria and Nicky so well. It should probably be awkward to be friends with your ex-wife and her girlfriend, but it never really was for them.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, uh…” Agatha knew this would come up. “It was sort of out of the blue actually.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What was?” Maria said as she returned from upstairs.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Aggies date.” Melinda teased. Agatha scrunched her face. Even back when she was Agnes she hated that fucking nickname.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please Mel, anything but </span>
<em>
<span>Aggie</span>
</em>
<span>.” Agatha grunted.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The three women walked to the lounge with newly filled glasses of wine and sat down. Agatha sitting across from Melinda and Maria who were cuddled together.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell me about the </span>
<em>
<span>date</span>
</em>
<span>.” Maria asked.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Why is everyone suddenly so interested in my love life?” Agatha asked, taking a sip of her wine.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Because, you don’t have one.” Maria teased.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Also, who in town has suddenly joined our team?” Mel asked. “You know Westview probably has the smallest queer dating pool in the state.”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, it’s not Gina is it?” Maria asked, pulling a face.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, god no. I know she’ll bang any guy with a heartbeat but no, I am not that desperate. I don’t even think she’s into women.” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, she might be the town drunk, but she’s straight.” Melinda said.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well then, who is it?” Maria asked again.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed nervously. How will she explain Rio’s sudden appearance without being too vague?</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She, uhm, is Jen’s friend.. Came along for the weekend when Jen came to visit Al, then we sort of hit it off on Friday and went on a date on Saturday. But she’s gone back home now…”</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria and Melinda stared at Agatha, mouths agape. “You, Agatha Harkness, went on a date with someone you met at a bar the night before?” Maria asked?</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What does </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>mean?” Agatha replied.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I asked you out like four times before you said yes and then you made me promise that it would just be coffee.” Maria explained.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I was… different back then. I was new in town and… shy…“ Agatha tried to defend herself.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well this mystery woman has some serious game…” Mel laughed.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I sort of already knew her, from college so no, not a complete stranger… but let’s talk about something else. My love life can’t be the only hot topic of the night…” </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio got up from her kitchen table after having a quick dinner. The long day she spent at the office was finally over. All through the day her mind kept on going back to Saturday night, visions of Agatha hovering over her and kissing her and touching her… Rio shook her head again to regain her composure. Somehow Agatha was everywhere she looked and everything she thought of. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio were texting throughout the day, but mostly just to check in with each other. Whatever this was, it was still very new, and Rio didn’t want to push too much too fast. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She finished cleaning the kitchen and jumped on the treadmill to get rid of some pent up energy. Running always seemed to help clear her head. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After a brutal thirty minutes she slammed the button and slowed down to a complete stop. The moment she stepped off the treadmill and caught her breath, a vision of Agatha’s smile popped back in her head. Frustrated, Rio threw her hand towel over her face and paced back and forth. “Get it together Vidal!” she grumbled to herself.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Stepping into the bathroom Rio turned on the warm water to a scolding heat. The room filled with steam as the hot water poured over her body, stinging just enough to give her the necessary effect. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After she’d cleaned herself and dried off she slipped into her pajamas and fell onto the bed in a huff, her phone held over her face with her chats open. Her fingers hovered over Agatha’s name and after considering and reconsidering she tapped on her name and typed a message.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: How is Westview’s favorite teacher doing?</span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>No response. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed and let her phone fall onto the bed beside her. It </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> late, she thought, and maybe Agatha was asleep already. Rio got out of bed and went to get a glass of water. She stared out of the kitchen window looking over the city lights stretched out before her. Finishing the last sip she sauntered back. To her surprise and relief, she saw a message from Agatha in her notifications.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha: I’ll have to ask Ms. Davis.</span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Please, I am sure she’s got nothing on you. Unless she’s got some GILF action going…</span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha: Stop… please. That is one picture I didn’t need in my head thank you.</span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Just so you know, if you were my teacher, you’d be my favorite…</span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha: If I were your teacher, we would be in so much trouble for Saturday… </span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: It could be our secret.</span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha: I think I prefer you not being my student. That way I could take you out when I see you again.</span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: A date? </span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha: If you wanted to. </span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: I would love that.</span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was grinning to herself, she felt giddy, excited. She had no idea when she would be able to see her again, but the prospect of it was enough for now.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: I can’t wait.</span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laid in bed, the wine from dinner at Maria’s was mulling around in her head. She sighed as she read Rio’s last message </span>
<em>
<span>“I can’t wait” </span>
</em>
<span>over and over again. Despite all the crap going on around her she was happy to have reconnected with Rio, and even with Jen. All potential danger aside, it was good to think she had some part of her old life with her now. Something to keep her from feeling like a stranger in her own life.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She couldn’t remember the last time she felt this optimistic or hopeful about anything really. To the people around her, she came across as fine, content even, but inside she always felt like a big imposter. She knew some days her smile didn’t reach her eyes, her sunglasses hid them most days. Her laughter had been forced here and there, the quality of the conversations aside, she didn’t find a lot of things to laugh about. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Happiness wasn’t something that always came naturally to her in Westview. Not since that night anyway. But she has had happy moments since then, if she was honest with herself. Her wedding day with Maria was a happy day. Or at least, she felt happy. And Nicky’s birth was difficult, but she remembers feeling happiness as she held him for the first time. Seeing him grow up also brought many happy moments. </span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Now after the weekend she felt terrified but… happy. Maybe the wine helped, and seeing Nicky, but no one could explain how she felt now, not even Agatha herself.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She typed one last message to Rio.</span>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Agatha: I am really happy to have met you… again. Sleep well Rio. </span>
</em>
</p><p><br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She didn’t wait for a reply, simply turned onto her side after locking her phone and fell into a peaceful sleep. </span>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The airport pick up zone was absolute chaos. Jen also chose the busiest time of day to arrive in Philadelphia, Rio already regretted agreeing to pick her up and house her for the two nights she would be spending here. But it was all part of </span>
<em>
<span>Project Darkhold</span>
</em>
<span> she reminded herself.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Today’s plan was reconnaissance with Lilia. She still needed to find a good enough reason to suddenly want to know where Agnes went, they weren’t friends before that Halloween night. That’s why Jen was coming here. She had a perfect reason to ask. They were friends and roommates. Understandable and plausible.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen walked out of the sliding doors looking like pink Disney royalty. Rio shook her head, the two were quite the pair. Rio dressed in her usual edgy black garb, and Jen looked like a debutant coordinator.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Get in,” Rio said loudly through the window, unlocking the passenger door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well hello to you too, Vidal.” Jen said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I waited almost 30 minutes for you princess,” Rio snarled, “Forgive me for not unrolling the red carpet.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, let’s just get this over with. For Agatha’s sake.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, sorry.” Jen was right, and Rio was a brat. Always been.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re meeting her at their offices at 2pm. Think we can make it?” Jen asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at the clock on the dashboard. “We have 25 minutes, let's get out of here.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*********</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a low whistle. “This building is fucking intimidating.” She said as they walked to the security desk.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll handle it.” Jen said quickly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen walked in front of Rio and greeted the security guard. “Jennifer Kale for Lilia Calderu please.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The security guard called up to the offices and nodded. He walked the two of them to the elevator and waited for them to get inside. Once they were alone, Jen turned to Rio. “Let me do the talking. I think since we were roommates it would make more sense for me to be the one looking for Agnes, you can be… a supportive friend, or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “Sure, let’s go with that, bestie.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They waited at the reception for Lilia. The offices of Calderu-Stone-Maximoff weren't as big as Rio imagined it to be, but the multiple glass walled offices, constant ringing phones and interns shuffling around made it seem intimidating enough to look big.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re up,” Jen said, standing up. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen followed a young intern to a big corner office. The glass walls were tinted to provide more privacy than the rest of the offices around it. They were led inside and asked to sit behind a desk, waiting for Lilia to arrive. Rio felt her nerves build up. She has met Lilia before, but that was wedding guest Lilia, not intimidating Criminal Lawyer Lilia.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Afternoon, ladies,” Lilia sang. “Jen, Rio, nice to see you two again.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks for doing this Lilia,” Jen said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So you two are looking for Agnes, I understand.” Lilia said, folding her arms on the desk.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen and Rio shared a look, “Yes, well it’s been ten years and I feel like I have lost touch with so many friends since I moved to New York. And Agnes, well, we were really close. I never got over her leaving so abruptly. I guess, what I’m looking for is… closure.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio caught herself staring at Jen, she suddenly blinked realizing she was staring. “Yeah, uhm, we just want closure, Lilia.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia sat back in her office chair, rocking back and forth slowly. “Well, I haven’t spoken to her in ten years, dear. What makes you think I would know where she is?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, Lilia, we know you… know things. Or at least, people who know things.” Jen answered carefully.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia narrowed her eyes. She shifted in her seat, leaning forward again. “Let’s say I know… people who know things. If Agnes wanted to be found, don’t you think she would have told you where she was going when she left?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Busted,</span>
</em>
<span> Rio thought. Even a bad lawyer would have asked that same question.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen sighed audibly, “I suppose she would have…” Rio looked over at her. Was she </span>
<em>
<span>crying</span>
</em>
<span>? Rio pulled a tissue from the wooden box on Lilia’s desk. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Adding to the dramatics, she gave the tissue to Jen and patted her back. “There, there.” she said, putting on her best </span>
<em>
<span>supporting friend </span>
</em>
<span>display.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen sniffed and blew her nose loudly. “I just can’t help but feel like something terrible happened to our friend and we never had a chance to say goodbye or make sure she was okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio saw Lilia’s face change to almost look sympathetic. Was this actually working? </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We all care for Agnes, that much is clear…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen looked up at Lilia, taking Rio’s hand and squishing the used tissue in her palm. Rio hid her disgust with a cough.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Leave me your number. If, and I do mean </span>
<em>
<span>If. </span>
</em>
<span>If I find out something and it is worth telling, I will let you know.” Lilia slid a notepad over to Jen and she quickly scribbled her phone number and name on it. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you Lilia, you have no idea what this will mean to me.” Jen said, getting up and pulling on the hand she was still holding. Rio stumbled up and thanked Lilia. They walked out of the offices, keeping their expressions neutral.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just before they reached the elevators, Wanda spotted them. “Jen, Rio? What on earth are you two doing here?” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Like two deers in headlights the pair stopped dead in their tracks. “Wanda!” Jen exclaimed, dropping Rio’s hand. Rio still held onto the gross tissue and looked around for a trash can. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda walked up to them. “Hey Wands,” Rio said, waving hesitantly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, you missed my party. Nat is not happy, and you know how I feel about her happiness.” Wanda scolded. Rio felt like a naughty child. She smiled an apologetic smile back at Wanda.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda narrowed her eyes at Rio and turned to Jen, “And you Dr. Kale…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well I didn’t get an invitation.” Jen said, cautiously. “But I believe you are quite the hotshot these days? There aren’t many Maximoffs in Philly so I guess this is you, huh.” she pointed to the signage on the walls. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Wanda said excitedly. “And you, Oncology’s next big thing I presume.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I do okay…” Jen said. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio interrupted the conversation, this could go on forever. “Look, as much as my heart warms at the sight of this beautiful reunion of long time friends, we need to leave. Jen is staying for the next two nights, so why don’t you and Nat come to my place tonight? We can all… catch up, and I’ll make it up to you for bailing on your dinner?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sounds great, Rio. I will call Nat.” Wanda smiled. “See you later.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Jen left the offices and headed back to Rio’s apartment. “Do you think she’ll call you?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know. I hope she believed us.” Jen said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll I for one, gave an oscar worthy performance in the role of supporting best friend. If she calls it would be because of that.” Rio laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just focus on the road, Miss Streep.” Jen rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>At the apartment Rio showed Jen to the guest room and placed an order for food and drinks to be delivered in time for the others to arrive.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know it’s not supposed to, but now that we know about Agatha, it feels… weird not having her here.” Jen said forlornly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, she would have probably liked to be here.” Rio admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt guilty for getting to spend the night with her friends, knowing Agatha had to leave them all behind. Maybe one day they could all be together again, she hoped. She decided to text her, she had been meaning to do so anyway.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Please ignore this if it is too sappy, but I just wanted you to know that I was thinking of you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio put down her phone on the coffee table and turned on the TV. The rest of the afternoon she and Jen sat in silence watching some nature documentary to kill time before everyone would be here for dinner.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A notification on Rio’s phone woke her from her daze staring at the TV. To her disappointment it was just the delivery guy informing her that he was almost at her door. The knock on the door forced them to get up and Rio quickly took the bags from the delivery guy and handed them to Jen who carried it to the kitchen while Rio tipped him.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The Redheads should be arriving soon.” Rio said. “I’m just going to change. Help yourself to whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio closed the door of her bedroom. She stared at her phone, specifically at the message left unread in her chat with Agatha. With a sigh, she pushed the phone into her pant’s pocket and walked to her closet to change her shirt.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When she stepped out of her room, Natasha and Wanda had already arrived. Jen, ever the Stepford Wife host, already helped them to get drinks.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s weird to see you two like this.” Nat said, gesturing to Jen and Rio, who historically would sit at opposite ends of a table, let alone share an apartment. But what Nat and Wanda didn’t know was that this temporary truce was for Project Darkhold, specifically Agatha, which they didn’t need to know of… yet.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Believe me, Nat, we’re not shacking up. Dr. Kale here needed a place to stay, while she was in town, and I…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Why </span>
<em>
<span>are</span>
</em>
<span> you in town, Jen?” Wanda asked, interrupting Rio. “Your parents moved, you live in New York…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen and Rio stared at each other. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck me, you hooked up?” Nat said. “That’s where you were Saturday, you bitch.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh…” Rio startled. This wasn’t good.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I never imagined this happening,” Nat continued, “But it makes sense now, the whole enemies to lovers thing…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck… </span>
</em>
<span>Rio’s eyes glared at Jen. Why wasn’t Jen stopping this? </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s nothing… yet” Jen said, smiling and fluttering her eyes at Rio. Rio felt her stomach turn, okay, so they were doing this.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s ah… new. I don’t even know if I really like her yet.” Rio said flatly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ouch babe,” Jen teased. “That’s not what you said when you begged me to come visit after I rocked your socks off in New York.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grunted. “Oh, fuck off, Kale.” She stood up and grabbed the boxes of pizza from the kitchen. “Eat, drink, leave.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The three other women laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen was going to pay for this, Rio thought.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***********</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Sometime through the evening, when the fourth or fifth bottle of wine was empty, Rio stood up and stumbled to her room to use the toilet. She pulled out her phone and decided that she wasn’t going to wait for Agatha to respond to her text so she called her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>On the third ring, Agatha answered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Hey,” </span>
</em>
<span>she answered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi Ags. How’r you?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio heard Agatha laugh. She smiled, she missed her laugh. </span>

<span>“I’m okay, stuck at school with the drama club. You sound… slurry.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, t’much wine.” Rio said. “Miss you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The phone was quiet. “Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’m here, sorry. I miss you too.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I wisssh I could kiss you now.” Rio said back.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed again. </span>
<em>
<span>“Well, I am flattered… I wish that too, you know.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled and leaned against the wall. There was a momentary silence from both sides. She heard the others in the living room laugh loudly and suddenly remembered she was supposed to just go to the bathroom. “I gotta go, babe.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Okay. Please be safe. And drink some water, Rio.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, water. Gottit.” Rio said. “See you soon, ‘kay?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Soon. Bye Rio.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Bye, Ags.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The call dropped. Rio leaned against the basin vanity and drunkenly smiled at herself. She was fucked. She tried to shake herself sober and splashed water on her face, used the toilet and headed back to the others.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She plopped onto the sofa and listened to the conversation between the others. She was smiling and laughing along but she felt her heart secretly wishing that she was somewhere else. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at her phone. She could hear Rio was obviously drunk and hoped she was safe at least. But she liked that Rio still phoned her, that she was thinking of her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, we need help with the set up.” Mrs. Davis interrupted her thoughts. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sure Sharon, show me what you need.” Agatha replied, returning her phone in her pocket.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The drama club was rehearsing for a school friendly version of Moulin Rouge. The script was butchered to remove all </span>
<em>
<span>“inappropriate” </span>
</em>
<span>scenes, as Sharon put it, leaving a barely recognizable storyline of a young songwriter, who fell in love with a theatre actress. The only part of the play they were allowed to keep was the music. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Billy had the lead role of Christian, the love struck song writer and Agatha had to admit, the kid was good, he had a good voice and despite the butchered script the play wasn’t the worst school play Agatha had seen. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Right, Teen, you’re over here and Satine, you’re here. The Elephant Love song is the big song everyone knows, so you have to sell it.” Agatha said, “Sharon, you can play the backtrack, let’s see what they’ve got.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The two kids sang and danced like they rehearsed earlier, Agatha stifled a laugh when Sharon shouted over the music “Less sexy, Satine.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When the song ended, Sharon declared the end of the night’s rehearsal, Agatha felt the relief, a long day at school followed by the massacre of a favorite musical was taking its toll.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“How was that Ms. H?” Billy asked as he jumped off the stage. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Not bad, but you have to take it down a notch, Sharon will combust from all the </span>
<em>
<span>sexiness </span>
</em>
<span>on stage.” She laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, she wouldn’t know sexy if she saw it.” He joked. “Speaking of sexy, how’s the mystery lady?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope, we’re not doing this Teen, you already know too much for your own good.” Agatha smirked. “And no, I am not sharing my love life with a 16 year old.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh come on, nothing exciting ever happens here, don’t be such a bummer.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This is inappropriate on so many levels.” She mumbled as they walked out of the auditorium.</span>

<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Friday finally came as a relief to Agatha. The school play had her busy every night until late. She missed Nicky, who she was picking up Sunday morning, and somewhat surprisingly, she missed Rio. Alice has also been missing during the week, which wasn’t as strange to Agatha, since Alice was one of a few police officers in their small town. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat in her car exhausted from finally finishing the last rehearsal of the week with the drama club. She looked at the clock on her dashboard, 19:25. To her relief, they actually finished at a decent time today, meaning she could still meet Alice for dinner before getting into bed early for the first night in a week.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She sent a confirmation text to Alice to meet at Tony’s and turned the car on.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>At Tony’s she pulled into an open parking space and just as she was about to get out, she heard her phone ring. It was Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Agatha answered surprised.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Hey, uh Agatha, how are you?” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio greeted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m good,” Agatha heard what sounded like a big party in the background, “Rio, where are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a laugh. </span>
<em>
<span>“Look up.” </span>
</em>
<span>she heard Rio say. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha asked, confused.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I said, look… up.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Still confused, Agatha frowned and shook her head as she obeyed and looked up over her steering wheel, and standing there in the two spotlights of her car’s headlights, there was Rio, waving at her with a smirk on her face.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha fumbled around in the car to turn it off and grab her stuff quick enough to get out. Deciding by herself that she was not going to act a fool, she forced herself to walk at a normal, casual pace, instead of running straight into her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She stopped in front of Rio, resisting the urge just a bit more to jump her bones. “Back so soon?” Agatha asked with a raised eyebrow.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You know, I never got to drink one of Tony’s famous house brand beers last time. I thought I needed to give it a try.” she teased, smiling at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You came all this way for a beer?” Agatha narrowed her eyes and took Rio’s hand in hers. Instantly she felt Rio tracing soft, small circles on her hand.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Amongst other things…” Rio smirked, stepping closer, “I did hope though, that the beer would come with stunning company… much like yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a warmth rush over her and before she could stop herself she leaned in, closing the final bit of distance between them and kissed Rio. Rio was smiling into the kiss and Agatha felt herself melt into Rio’s arms. “I think that can be arranged.” She whispered against her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They got lost in the kiss. Agatha’s lips suddenly remembering the softness of Rio’s and wanting more. Breaking the spell they found themselves under, they heard someone behind them clearing their throat. “Honestly you two,” Alice interrupted loudly, “Why do I find you two always making out in Tony’s parking lot?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, resting her head against Rio’s chest. She rolled her eyes looking up seeing Alice and Jen standing at the entrance of the bar. Taking Rio’s hand she turned to walk past them, ignoring the two smug faces of her friends.  “Alice, Jen, nice to see you too…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Inside the bar, the night was already in full swing with the normal patrons sitting at their usual tables and the karaoke machine already being in full use, but with Rio so close, Agatha had no intention of staying too long tonight, not with Rio’s hand burning on her thigh as she slowly traced patterns over the fabric of her pants. Agatha had to remind herself constantly to keep a straight face, trying her best not to be affected by Rio’s palm sliding closer and closer to the inside of her thighs. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha heard some of the conversations around the table but she never registered what they were actually talking about. She was in a daze, holding her breath and glancing at Rio in slow motion. It wasn’t only the drinks they had blurring her vision, she was mesmerized, seeing how Rio’s face lit up laughing at some funny story Alice was telling or rolling her eyes when Jen gave her shit. When she felt three sets of eyes staring at her she suddenly realized they were waiting for her to respond to something.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry… what?” She asked sheepishly, blinking her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow Ags, what’s going on with you tonight?” Alice asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, I am just a bit tired I think. The uhm… drama club kept me up all week.” she tried to explain.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me guess,” Jen said, “They’re doing Romeo and Juliet?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, worse, Moulin Rouge but “</span>
<em>
<span>less sexy</span>
</em>
<span>” as Sharon puts it. Poor kids…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Less sexy? What the fuck does that mean?” Jen asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish I knew. It is hilarious to watch really, and Sharon is slowly losing it. I think that’s the real reason why I agreed to do it, that woman is unhinged, we’re all just waiting for her to explode.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not like Moulin Rouge is about a monastery. I can’t wait to hear how they are keeping it PG.” Alice laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well instead of a brothel, it is a theatre company, and she changed some of the words in the songs. </span>
<em>
<span>Like a Virgin, touched for the very first time </span>
</em>
<span>has been changed to </span>
<em>
<span>Like a dancer, on stage for the very first time.</span>
</em>
<span> It’s horrible really. I loved that movie, now all I can hear is the terrible replacement lyrics.” Agatha laughed, hanging her head in shame.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’d really love to see it,” Rio laughed along. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please no, it’s a school play in the middle of New Jersey, you’d be wasting your time. Plus it’s in the middle of the week, you’ll have to come back just for that.” Agatha said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, I really would,” Rio squeezed her hand. Agatha looked down at their hands intertwined in her lap. When she looked up, Rio was looking at her with an unreadable yet soft expression. “You’ve worked hard on it and you deserve the support, and what’s another three hour drive to see my favorite history teacher again? Plus, I need to hear the rest of that song.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her breath leaving her chest, no one has ever even attempted to support anything she was a part of, not her first school play when she was the lead in middle school, not her first run as captain of the debate team. Lilia came to her graduation and that was about it for familiar faces in the crowd of parents and family members. Now Rio was offering to come to a school play which she just directed from the sidelines.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” She asked, “You’d want to come?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I would love to, Ags, if you want me to be there.” Rio smiled. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course. That would be great.” She smiled, getting lost in her dark eyes again. “</span>
<em>
<span>You’re</span>
</em>
<span> great.” Agatha leaned in and gave Rio a deep kiss cupping her cheeks, suddenly forgetting where they were.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay lovebirds,” Alice interrupted again. “Maybe it’s time to turn in, before we get kicked out for… whatever this is.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, pulling herself away from Agatha. Agatha gave an audible sigh.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They stepped out of the bar and greeted the other two. Agatha waved as they drove off together and turned to Rio, “So…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So…” Rio repeated with that adorable smirk on her face again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You uhm… would you…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes.” Rio answered, cutting off Agatha’s question. “Very much.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled and placed a quick kiss on Rio’s lips. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll follow you home.” Rio said, still holding on to Agatha’s waist.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>********</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled into her driveway and Rio pulled up next to her. She grabbed her bag and got out, waiting for Rio to do the same and led them to the front door. Agatha opened the door and let Rio in first, walking in behind her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hung her jacket and keys up in the foyer, watching Rio do the same with hers and walk to the living room. Agatha walked up behind her and suddenly she felt nervous as she watched Rio standing there frozen, taking in the room. She walked up to stand beside her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re welcome to take the guest room again.” Agatha offered quietly. Rio looked like she was thinking and considering her offer, till she slowly turned to face Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked into her eyes, feeling them bore into her soul and tried her best not to break eye contact. She felt Rio slowly take her hands in hers, moving her hands up her arms, over her shoulders and resting them on either side of her neck. Agatha let out a quiet sigh, and closed her eyes at the feeling of Rio gently massaging the back of her neck.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened her eyes slowly and found them locked on Rio’s. Her hands had moved without her knowing and rested on Rio’s hips. Slowly their lips met in a soft, slow kiss. Agatha felt Rio pulling her closer and tightening the hold on her neck, deepening the kiss and letting their tongues slide over each other’s.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The hunger inside threatening to bubble out from her chest as she grabbed at Rio’s back to bring them impossibly closer. Agatha’s head was spinning as their kiss deepened and she felt herself losing control. “Rio…” she whispered breathlessly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio answered with a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I really missed you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too babe,” Rio replied, pulling her closer into a tight hug. “You've got me under your spell and I have no intention of snapping out of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes at her admission, breathing in Rio’s scent and holding onto her as if this was the last time she ever would again. She hoped it wouldn’t be. No, she wanted this to last as long as possible.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you staying over?” Agatha asked, almost too afraid to hear the answer.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“If you’re okay with it? I made arrangements to be able to work remotely if I need to…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her face pull into a wide smile, “Really?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I can stay till the play if you want.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha </span>
<em>
<span>did</span>
</em>
<span> want it, in fact Agatha wanted even more, but they weren’t there yet. “Okay, that’s…” she kissed Rio quickly, “That will be amazing”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tucked a stray strand of hair behind Agatha’s ear and cupped her face, “You’re so beautiful,” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blushed, “Just kiss me, you sap.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled and scoffed a short laugh before pulling Agatha in for a searing kiss, their bodies flush against each other and almost burning through the fabric between them. Agatha’s hands moving frantically over Rio’s body, touching, feeling, pulling.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled Rio with her, never breaking the kiss and dragged her into the guest room, it was closer than hers and she couldn’t wait to get to touch Rio again. The way Rio responded to her kiss and touches confirmed that she felt the same. Clothes were pulled off and haphazardly discarded on their way into the guest bedroom. They stumbled over their shoes and with a thump Agatha fell backwards onto the bed, pulling Rio along with her to fall on top of her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio both laughed at the absurdity of it all, gasping for the lost breaths that were pushed out when they fell on top of each other on the bed. Agatha stared up at the brown eyes hovering above her, Rio’s hair spilling out of her loose bun and took a second to admire and take in her beauty. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Slowly, she raised her head connecting their lips again and Agatha felt Rio kiss her so sweetly, she almost couldn’t stand it. Rio, now almost fully on top of Agatha, moved slightly to the side, letting her thigh rest between Agatha’s legs. Agatha shivered under Rio’s hands lightly moving down her neck, cupping her breast and squeezing gently. Agatha moaned into Rio’s mouth and arched her back, pushing herself further into Rio’s palm. Rio seemed to understand the gesture perfectly, adding more pressure and gently swiping her thumb over the pebbled nipple under it. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt herself growing desperate for more as she bucked her hips up, searching for some friction against Rio’s thigh. Rio replaced her hand with her mouth and circled Agatha’s nipple with her tongue. Agatha felt the fiery trial of Rio’s hands moving down her side eventually caressing her inner thigh. Finally her internal screams were answered when she felt Rio’s fingers delicately moving between her wet folds.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A low moan escaped her chest and she moved her hips in sync with the hand slowly bringing her over the edge so beautifully. The combination of Rio’s mouth on her nipple, her other hand mimicking her mouth on her other breast and the concentrated circles on her clit felt like absolute heaven. Agatha pulled Rio’s mouth off of her and brought her back to her own, desperately needing to feel her kiss again, even though that meant that she lost the feel of her on her breast.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio changed her angle and entered Agatha with two strong fingers curling up just right and Agatha’s eyes shot open at the sudden change of feeling and moaned Rio’s name like a prayer over and over again. This seemed to only encourage Rio to fasten her pace and increase the pressure. Agatha brought both arms around Rio’s back, holding on as if her life depended on it while Rio kissed and lightly bit her neck in just the perfect places.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt like her internal dam wall broke as she came with a low growl, definitely leaving her nail imprints all over Rio’s back as she held on for dear life. Rio slowly worked her through her climax and Agatha felt another wave roll over her when Rio finally pulled out and gave one last stroke up from her opening over her very sensitive clit. She called out her name and fell back onto the mattress struggling to calm her breaths and her heart threatening to pound out of her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her passionately, holding onto her and caressing her skin all over. With a wordless look, Agatha rolled them over and ground her sensitive wet core over Rio’s, feeling their warm wet cores sliding over each other. Rio’s eyes rolled back into her head and Agatha bent down, kissing and dragging her teeth down her neck, never stopping the movement of her hips. When Rio’s breathing started picking up again, Agatha moved her hand between them and ground her hips just so to provide extra friction to where Rio needed it.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, don’t stop, please.” Rio moaned, and Agatha increased her pressure and movements. She felt herself starting to build up again, and lifted herself slightly to relieve the overstimulation she was feeling. Rio moaned at the loss of pressure but Agatha quickly replaced her hips with her hands again, pushing into Rio and keeping her thumb circling over Rio’s sensitive bud. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat up and pulled Agatha in for a messy kiss, tongues and teeth fighting for dominance as their bodies writhed together in pleasure. Rio grabbed at Agatha’s back and pulled her even closer. Agatha felt Rio starting to clench around her and added another digit, causing Rio to scream out at the sensation. This sent them both over the edge, almost simultaneously. Agatha allowed Rio to ride out her climax and with one last jerk, Rio collapsed onto her shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>In the tender silence of the afterglow, they sat intertwined holding onto each other. Agatha kissed her shoulder softly, using the small freckles like a map and eventually trailed her mouth up to place a languid kiss on Rio’s soft lips. When both of their breathing seemed to even out, they fell to the side and Agatha pulled the covers over them, feeling the sweat on their bodies start to cool in the winter air in the room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laid in the crook of Agatha’s arm and she felt Rio’s breathing returning to a steady rhythm as she slowly fell asleep in her arms. Agatha kissed the top of her head and gave her a gentle squeeze, “Good night, Rio.” she whispered in the dark, eventually closing her eyes and falling into a deep, satisfied sleep.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>

<span>*******</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Meanwhile… Somewhere back in Philadelphia, a phone buzzes to life. In a dark corner office overlooking the city, a glass of whiskey is put down on a table to answer the phone. “Yes?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“It’s definitely her.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re sure it’s the girl in the picture?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Yes, I’m sure it’s her. What do you need me to do?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep an eye on her for now. I’ll have to figure out what to do next. If they found her, that means there’s a trace, I just have to find it.”</span>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Waking up in Agatha’s arms again stirred something in Rio. A feeling she didn’t understand yet, but didn’t want to push away either. So instead of staring at the ceiling and overthinking everything before the sun even rose, she decided to go for a run to clear her head. She rolled out of bed, careful not to wake Agatha, gave her a quick kiss on the cheek before putting on her clothing and running shoes. She left a small note on the pillow. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Out for a quick run</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>xxx R </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The crisp November morning air burnt her cheeks as she jogged down the street. She kept a steady pace as she passed the quiet houses in the sleepy neighborhood. Other early risers passed her and greeted her as she passed them. When she reached the end of the street, turning into the main road she looked around to cross the street and in doing so, she bumped into someone walking their dog.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck… sorry.” she said, steadying the woman.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It was my fault, sorry. Benji here is too eager this morning.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled friendly and when she saw no one was injured, she turned to continue on her run.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re Agatha’s friend, aren’t you?” the woman asked Rio, stepping in front of her and blocking her from moving further.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stopped and took in the woman, she was a small blond lady, already overdressed for just walking a dog this time of the day. “Yeah from… college.” she narrowed her eyes suspiciously. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what she said.” the woman said with an annoying smile.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, I just want to finish my run, sorry again about running into you.” Rio answered. She stared down the main road. The woman was still looking at her with that fucking smile. It was creeping her out, so instead of turning onto the main road, she decided to get back to Agatha. When she was out of sight from the woman, she stopped and sent a text message on the </span>
<em>
<span>Project Darkhold </span>
</em>
<span>group chat.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Alice, do you know about a nosy blond lady who smiles too much living in A’s neighbourhood?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushed her phone back into her pocket and ran back towards Agatha’s. She couldn’t help but think that whoever that lady was, she was fishing for something and she needed to know what.</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>When she stepped into Agatha’s house she felt her phone buzz against her leg.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Alice: Dottie? Is this her?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at the picture attached to the text. That was her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Yup, she seemed to be fishing for something. Alice, can you check on her? I have a bad feeling.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Alice: I’ll see what I can find.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen: Y’all waking me up before the sun for blond ladies? </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Are you two not together right now?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Alice: Jen is next to me in bed. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen: And I should still be sleeping.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Sorry princess. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Alice, let me know what you find. I don’t trust her.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“There you are.” Agatha said, still a bit sleepy.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio said, walking over to Agatha, giving her a quick kiss. “Sorry, yeah, I went for a run.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled her closer, “What? Was last night’s cardio not enough for you?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and smirked at Agatha, “I was just warming up.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh really?” Agatha whispered against her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt her heart jolt and leaned into the kiss. “But now I need a shower. Care to join me?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes darkened and she grabbed Rio’s hand, dragging her into the shower. Rio did not protest one bit, biting her lip in anticipation as Agatha slipped her hand beneath the hem of Rio’s shirt. Agatha made quick work of removing Rio’s clothes and Rio watched as Agatha slipped out of her robe letting it fall in a bundle around her feet. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The warm water of the shower cascaded down their bodies as their lips met for a deep kiss. The only thing warmer was the heat radiating from between them. Rio’s hands roamed over Agatha’s body, leaving no piece of skin untouched. Rio felt herself being turned around and pressed up against the cold tiles of the shower. She hissed at the sensation of feeling the cold tiles against her warm skin.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed Rio’s wet hair aside and kissed the back of Rio’s neck, trailing slowly down her spine, while her hands held onto her hips. Rio spread her legs when she felt Agatha’s hands move between her thighs. Her head fell back as Agatha touched her wet center and reached around grabbing at Agatha’s hair, craning her neck to kiss her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was pushed back into the cold tiles when Agatha pushed her body up against hers. Her hand had moved to Rio’s front to start circling her clit. Panting, Rio pushed herself off of the tiles and turned to face Agatha, the loss of touch between her legs was only there briefly as Agatha returned her hand as soon as Rio was facing her again. Hooking a leg around Agatha’s hips, Rio pulled them back to steady herself on the shower wall once again, allowing Agatha access to enter her with a strong thrust. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed at Agatha’s ass, feeling Agatha reach a little deeper. She ground her hips into Agatha’s hand and held on tightly over her back as the thrusts got stronger inevitably pushing her over the edge. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio found her footing again and pulled Agatha close for a lazy kiss as the water started running colder. “I actually really needed to shower, babe.” She laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kissed her again and handed her the soap to wash up before all the warm water was gone. They giggled as they struggled to both get clean under the lukewarm water and rinse off.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After their shower, Agatha made them breakfast and they enjoyed the rest of their morning together cuddling under a blanket watching some dumb sci-fi movie, not really concentrating on the story, more on each other. They stole small kisses which would lead to longer kisses and then to a full blown make-out session. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It was during one of these hot and heavy make-out sessions where Agatha was straddling Rio’s hips under the blanket, slowly grinding up against her, when suddenly there was a knock at the front door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ignore it,” Rio said breathily between hot kisses.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha continued without another thought, ignoring the knocking, and kissed down Rio’s jaw to her neck. Another round of knocking interrupted them and Agatha threw her head back in frustration, making Rio blow out a laugh.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Who fucking is it?” she yelled as she stomped over to the door to open it. The door flung open, and Agatha was excitedly greeted by Nicky. “Language mom!” Nicky grinned, stepping forward to hug her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry kid,” she said, hugging him and slipping out of the house and closing the door behind her. “Hey Mel. I thought I was picking him up tomorrow?” Agatha asked, confused.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Maria said she sent you a text saying that we’re dropping him off today, we’re visiting my parents out of town today and we’ll only be back tomorrow night.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha suddenly remembered the text she read and quickly dismissed, fuck, how could she have forgot. “Oh yeah, pfft, sure, I just… forgot today was… </span>
<em>
<span>today </span>
</em>
<span>today. But thanks for dropping him off,” Agatha pulled Nicky closer and rubbed his head. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mo-ooom,” he protested. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They greeted Melinda as she walked back to her car, noticing the big black Range Rover in the drive-way.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Who’s here?” Nicky asked, also noticing the big black Range Rover.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh uhm, that’s my… Rio… my friend is visiting us this week.” Agatha fucked this up already, she thought to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh okay.” Nicky said, shrugging as if it’s nothing and walked to open the front door, but Agatha beat him to it and called out when she opened the door, “Nicky is back!” hoping Rio would get the message and hide the fact that they were basically making-out like horny teenagers just a few minutes ago.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She hesitated before turning the corner, uncertain if Rio understood, and just as she was about to turn to see where Nicky was in case she had to cover his eyes, Rio appeared in front of them extending her hand out to Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey kid, I’m Rio, your mom’s…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“...friend from college…” Agatha interjected.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah… from college.” Rio smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Sorry…” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha mouthed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah, Nic, why don’t you go put your bag in your room?” Agatha asked, pushing him towards the bedrooms.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“O-kay…” he said, pulling his face suspiciously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When Nicky was out of sight, Agatha quickly turned to Rio, “I completely forgot he’s coming home early.” She whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled and took her hand, “Don’t worry about it Ags, he’s your son, I understand. I can book a hotel room…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, please don’t. Stay… if you are okay. The guest room is yours, if you want it.” Agatha asked hopeful.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t want to make this… weird for you and Nicky. Are you sure?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Definitely,” Agatha leaned close and stole a kiss just as she heard Nicky returning from his room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The two women jumped apart putting as much distance between them without looking too obvious.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled in apology at Rio and looked back to Nicky, who made himself comfortable on the sofa, just next to where they were earlier.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing?” Nicky asked curiously, looking at the two of them.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly Agatha realized how this might look to him. Rio was dressed in sweatpants and an oversized t-shirt with messy hair from Agatha’s hands being entangled in it just a few moments ago, and Agatha was dressed similarly, not her usual “having guests over” look.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, we were just watching a movie.” Agatha explained, trying to sound normal.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we watch Spiderman?” Nicky asked excitedly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Again?” Agatha rolled her eyes, and turned to Rio, standing frozen watching the interaction between the two.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please?” He asked again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yess!” Nicky said excitedly, “And we need popcorn! Rio, don’t you want popcorn?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw Rio’s head snap in her direction, obviously taken aback by Nicky suddenly addressing her directly. “Uh, yeah. Of course! We can’t watch a movie without popcorn, Agatha…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, “You two are not allowed to team up against me..” she said, walking to the kitchen to make the popcorn.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha put the popcorn in the microwave and watched Rio sit carefully on a chair facing Nicky. She smiled up at her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The microwave dinged and Agatha poured the popcorn into a bowl taking it to Nicky who was already sitting comfortably, waiting for the movie to start. While Agatha went back to the kitchen to grab them some sodas she heard Nicky talk to Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” Nicky asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” She answered, carefully.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You can sit next to me, then we can share the bowl.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, okay,” Rio answered and moved herself to sit where he indicated. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could see her feeling uncomfortable, “Nicky, don’t be so bossy, please.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She can’t see the TV, mom.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay, I don’t mind,” Rio said softly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was just about to sit down when Nicky patted the space on the other side of him, “You can sit here mom.” She gave him a stern look, “Please,” he smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>And that is how the three of them ended up spending the rest of the afternoon, watching Spiderman and snacking on the popcorn on Nicky’s lap. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually Rio seemed to warm up a bit and joined in on the commentary. Nicky would say something about the movie to her and when she’d replied he laughed and they made jokes and laughed together some more. Agatha paid zero attention to the movie, she could keep her attention away from the two next to her, suddenly getting along as if they’ve known each other forever. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They ended up watching two Spiderman movies, and when Nicky asked to start a third, Agatha had to make it stop. “No please, no more!” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Nicky protested in unison.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I said, no teaming up on me.” She tried to look annoyed but suddenly two sets of similar brown eyes were simultaneously staring into her soul. She gasped quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen, we need to get out of this house. How about we all get dressed and then we can go get dinner?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we get pizza? Please, pleasepleaseplease!” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes Nicky, we can get pizza.” She said with feigned exasperation.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed quietly as Nicky ran to his room to get dressed. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you okay? Sorry, he gets very excited.” Agatha said, slightly concerned at pushing over Rio’s boundaries.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” she replied quietly, “He’s a great kid, Agatha.” Rio smiled, taking her hand. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled down at their hands. She felt nervous suddenly, her two worlds were now fully colliding. “Shall we get dressed?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, let's go.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio disappeared into the guest room and Agatha into hers.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*********</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The three of them sat at a table in the restaurant waiting for their drinks to arrive. “How was your week with your mother?” Agatha asked Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It was great! Everyone loved my hotdog costume </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> we got to wear it at school for show and tell!” Nicky answered, stretching his eyes in excitement.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You were dressed as a hotdog for Halloween?” Rio asked him.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah! It was awesome!” Nicky blurted out. “Mom’s got a picture, I asked Ma to send it to her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took out her phone and scrolled to the picture to show Rio. Nicky grabbed at the phone to look first, “Hey!” Agatha said, trying to get her phone back.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I wanna see if it’s a cool picture first, mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, “You already saw it when your mother took it.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky laughed out loud at himself in the photo and turned to Rio to show it to her, “Look Rio. Tell me this isn’t the funniest Halloween costume you’ve </span>
<em>
<span>ever</span>
</em>
<span> seen!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and looked at the picture being shown. “It’s great,” she laughed. “Want to see mine?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shot her a look, she remembered the Halloween costume Rio wore that night ten years ago, it wasn’t exactly PG. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio showed Nicky her phone and he burst out laughing, “That’s awesome!” he exclaimed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Show me,” Agatha asked, curious as to what he was laughing at.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned her phone to Agatha and she nearly spat out her drink. The picture was of a small, maybe ten year old Rio, also dressed like a hotdog standing in between her parents dressed like ketchup and mustard.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That is adorable,” Agatha said laughing. “How are there two people in my life crazy enough to dress like a hotdog?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You must have excellent taste, mom.” Nicky said proudly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio laughed in unison at the smartass kid. Agatha felt her heart swell up. This felt so normal, so natural. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the evening they enjoyed their pizza together in great company. Nicky and Rio often joked together and Agatha couldn’t help but laugh along, the two of them seemed to share the same sense of humor.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They walked to the car after dinner and drove back home. Nicky, acting like Rio’s personal local tour guide, explained all the attractions around town as they drove past them on the way home. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When Agatha stopped the car, Nicky was still busy babbling away until they walked into the house. “Rio?” he asked. “I hope you are staying here tonight. Tomorrow is pancake Sunday and mom always makes the best pancakes. You can’t miss it.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh does she now?” Rio said, grinning at Agatha. “Well if it is so highly recommended, how can I say no?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, smirking, “Time to get ready for bed, baby, I’ll come say goodnight in a minute.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Good night Rio. Breakfast is at eight, so don’t be late.” He sang as he ran to his room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, “Wow, he’s really intense about the pancake schedule. Does he really hold you to it?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“To the pancakes, yes. But not the time… It’s just something I said once and it stuck. It’s never really at eight. That’s way too early for a Sunday.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Moooooom” Nicky called from his room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll be right back.” Agatha squeezed Rio’s hand and kissed her on the cheek on her way over to Nicky’s room. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat down on the bed next to Nicky, tucking a stray curl out of his face. She has never loved anything like she loved her son, and despite what she went through to get here, her life wouldn’t be the same without him. She smiled down at him, “Good night baby.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Night mom.” he smiled back and rolled to his side, cuddling his blanket. Agatha rubbed his back as he fell asleep. She stood up carefully and pulled the door shut behind her as she walked out.</span>

<span>Agatha woke up earlier than normal on Sunday morning, probably because this wasn’t a normal Sunday morning. Rio was here, sleeping in the guest room a few doors down from hers and Nicky’s. The night before, after she had tucked Nicky into bed, she and Rio spent the rest of the evening cuddling up on the sofa under a wooly blanket, sharing stories and getting to know each other more. Talking with Rio felt like talking to an old friend who’s known you forever. Nothing seemed too much, or too intense to share. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They joked with each other, shared their dreams and hopes for their futures, and spoke about where they might have ended up if RB never happened. But every timeline Agatha would think of, her story somehow found its way back to Rio. Rio simply smiled and kissed her, adding that if her life were any different she still hoped that she would get back to Agatha, or even better, she would have never left her that night to begin with. Agatha felt the air change after that conversation, with all that was said, something unspoken hung between them, something… inevitable.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Laying in her bed she turned to see what time it was, 05:12. She felt restless in her own body, fighting the urge to rather be next to Rio, but she couldn’t do that to Nicky, it would be too confusing. Rio was a stranger, and Agatha never had strangers over, let alone share a bed with them while Nicky was home.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She rolled over onto her back, contemplating. Eventually all reason left her mind as she quietly got out of bed and left her room, closing the door behind her. She padded softly past Nicky’s bedroom and when she reached the guest bedroom she knocked as quietly as possible. She heard a rustle behind the door and it opened with a gentle creek.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi, can I… come in?” she whispered back.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio opened the door wider and stood to the side to let her in. They both stared at each other for a moment until Rio held her hand out to take Agatha’s. She led them to the bed and held open the covers for her to climb in. Agatha scooted over to the side and felt Rio climb in behind her, spooning her from the back with her arm draped comfortably around her waist.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Good morning, Gorgeous.” Rio said softly, kissing the nape of Agatha’s neck.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let out a small laugh as Rio’s warm breath tickled her neck. “Morning.” she said, wiggling herself even closer into Rio’s embrace. They laid like that for a few minutes before drifting back to sleep. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>********************</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha woke suddenly as she heard Nicky call out her name somewhere in the house. She felt somewhat disoriented for a split second, this wasn’t her room and she wasn’t in her bed, she was still in Rio’s bed and her son was looking for her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck,” Agatha whispered waking Rio in the process, “Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sprung out of bed and paced, thinking. How will she get out of the room without Nicky seeing her leaving Rio’s?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, what are you doing?” Rio asked with a groggy voice.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky cant see me leave your room, he doesn't know… I cant…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stood up and walked over to her, “I’ve got this babe. Give me ten minutes then you can sneak back to your room.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched with wide eyes as Rio got dressed in her sweats and pulled her hair into a bun, slipping out of the room. She faintly heard Rio speaking to Nicky, </span>
<em>
<span>“Hey Nic, you’re up early.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Yeah, it’s pancake Sunday, Rio, and I couldn’t wait.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“You couldn’t wait until… eight?” Rio teased.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She heard Nicky laugh out loud and rolled her eyes lovingly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I’ll wake mom.” she heard him say. She started to panic.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“No, let’s leave your mom to sleep in a bit. I can make a decent pancake…” Rio said, “Want to help me, then we can surprise her with pancake Sunday… in bed?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Yeah, that will be awesome.” she heard him yell.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha waited a few minutes and quietly opened the guest bedroom door and snuck back to her own to wait for them. She’ll act extra surprised, just in case, she thought.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt victorious as she saw Agatha sneak back into her own bed after convincing Nicky to surprise Agatha with breakfast in bed, rather than Agatha surprising him with her, not in her bed, but in Rio’s. Crisis averted, but now, she had to make pancakes, and yes, she did lie when she said she could make it.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>So when all else fails, google it. She followed a very excited Nicky into the kitchen and asked him to help her get the mixer and bowls ready while she searched for a pancake recipe online. </span>
<em>
<span>“Failproof pancake recipe” </span>
</em>
<span>she searched, adding “</span>
<em>
<span>for dummies” </span>
</em>
<span>at the end, because let's face it, Rio and baking has never been said in one sentence before. She finally found a recipe that was for kids, appropriate.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky helped her get all the ingredients from the pantry and fridge and she helped him mix them together. She greased two pans and poured a few mounds in each pan. She helped him carefully flip his pancakes while she carefully flipped hers, sighing with gratitude when they actually started looking like the pancakes in the pictures.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After they finished with the last pancake she helped Nicky fill three glasses with juice and put them on the tray to carry to Agatha’s room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay kid, ready to surprise your mom?” she asked as she picked up the tray of food they prepared.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Nicky said excitedly. He ran towards her room and barged through the door. Rio tried to slow him down, but she obviously forgot to tell him not to scare his mom. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom! Mom!” Nicky jumped in excitement as Rio stood in the doorway. Agatha was sitting up in her bed, acting surprised like she suspected nothing. Rio smirked and hid her laugh when they made eye contact.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio helped me with pancake Sunday!” he said, pulling Rio by the arm towards the bed. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She awkwardly followed him, trying not to spill the juice and set the tray down on the bed in front of Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, baby, this looks amazing.” she said, kissing Nicky’s head. “Thank you Rio, for helping him.” she smiled brightly at Rio. Agatha’s smile beamed at her and Rio suddenly felt her cheeks warm. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I mean, I was up and thought I could… help, you know. No big deal.” she said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky climbed on the bed and Rio and Agatha both reached for the tray to keep him from bumping anything over.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Careful, baby.” Agatha said laughing. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The three of them settled on Agatha’s bed and enjoyed the pancakes. Rio was very impressed with her first ever batch, they tasted great and the others seemed to enjoy them too. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, can I play games?” Nicky asked after they finished eating. Agatha usually let him play a bit while she worked, so she agreed to let him play for an hour or so. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, do you play?” he asked with a big smile.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Baby, Rio doesn’t p…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah bud, what are we playing?” Rio answered, interrupting Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky listed his games and Rio agreed to play Minecraft with him. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, well I guess you two can play.” Agatha said with mock defeat.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah!” Nicky and Rio said, giving each other a high five.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“But Nicky,” Rio said, “Before we play, let's go clean up our mess. Your mom is going to kill me when she sees the kitchen.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh dear…” Agatha laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The morning rattled Agatha slightly. It felt so domesticated, so natural to have Nicky and Rio surprise her in bed with breakfast, like a family would on a special occasion. But they weren’t a family, Rio was… well her… Rio, and Agatha and Nicky had similar mornings like this with Maria when they were still together, but having the experience she had this morning with Rio…was this something she could hope for with her? A life with Rio and Nicky and sharing pancakes in bed on Sundays?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes and shook her head, she was getting ahead of herself, she thought. Even if it felt nice to have this feeling of… hope, she had to pace herself. Stay realistic and careful. She had a life and a son to protect and that he was still her priority, no matter what.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She got dressed quickly and heard the two in the kitchen cleaning up after the breakfast they prepared. Agatha walked to the kitchen silently and stared at Rio and Nicky standing with their backs turned to her in front of the sink while Rio washed and Nicky dried. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Their conversation was foreign to Agatha, she could make out some things they were discussing about the game they were going to play after this. She laughed at Nicky explaining in exaggeration what he was planning to build and what he expected Rio to do, as if she was his Minecraft servant for the day.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wow, this looks… clean.” Agatha smirked, interrupting the two and taking in the mess of flour still spread over the counter.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You missed the worst of it, but we’re almost done. You just relax, M’lady.” Rio said, winking at her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt somewhat out of place in her own home suddenly, but she smiled contently and put on the coffee machine and sat behind the counter waiting for her coffee to brew and her breakfast chefs to finish cleaning up their mess.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After the kitchen was clean and everyone dressed for the day, Rio and Nicky settled in front of the TV to play some game Agatha had no intention of understanding. Another thing she found hard to understand, although it warmed her heart in every way possible, was how Nicky and Rio got along like they’ve known each other for their whole lives. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched them play while she graded the last of the papers for school, but she often found herself watching the two play and watching the TV like she understood what they were doing, commenting and yelling excitedly as their characters ran to hide from their enemies. She had to admit that it was exciting, and seeing the two interact stirred something deep in her and her endearment for Rio grew stronger by the minute. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A few hours passed like this before Rio suggested they take a break for the day. Nicky protested, but Rio promised they would continue some other time. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the day passed in a strange domesticity which Agatha tried to ignore the significance of. Her relationship with Rio wasn’t clear, even though she felt like they were already moving toward something real, something significant.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When Nicky went to bed that night, Agatha let Rio sneak into her room for the night. The few walls separating the guest bedroom and hers suddenly felt too much. Agatha laid curled up in Rio’s arms, a sense of contentment settled over them. Agatha felt Rio place a soft kiss against her temple, “Ags?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mmm?” she answered lazily.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I really had a great weekend.” Rio said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too,” she said, lifting her head to kiss just below Rio’s chin. “Nicky really likes you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I like him too.” Rio admitted with a warm smile.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised herself on her elbow and stared at Rio. She could feel her thoughts trying to spill out of her mouth, trying to confess her desire to keep Rio in her life, but she felt hesitant. What if she was rushing this, what if Rio didn’t feel the same…</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cupped her face and kissed her softly. “I really like his mom too, you know.” Rio whispered against her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah?” Agatha asked shyly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Very much, actually.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart did a flip in her chest and she felt her face pull in a wide smile. “I think she likes you too, very much actually.” she echoed her quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know we just met... again, but I really want to ask you something. And I know the timing is… well difficult, but I would really love it if you…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned back to look into Rio’s eyes. “If I?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, suddenly looking bashful. “I would like to </span>
<em>
<span>be</span>
</em>
<span> with you… like exclusively, or whatever.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed. “Rio Vidal, are you asking me to be your girlfriend?” she teased.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, yeah. Now it sounds kind of dumb, I know, but yes. Would you be my girlf…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t give her time to finish her sentence. She grabbed Rio by the neck and kissed her deeply. “I would really love that.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You would?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Very much.” Agatha kissed Rio softly, but felt the kiss deepen almost instantly. She kissed her </span>
<em>
<span>girlfriend </span>
</em>
<span>and felt herself smile into the kiss. Their kisses turned sleepy and eventually they drifted off to sleep in each other’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>That night Agatha dreamt of a life she didn’t yet know. One where Rio woke up next to her every morning, one with a house filled with the laughter of happy children and where love lived within the walls of </span>
<em>
<span>their</span>
</em>
<span> shared life. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s alarm woke them up. Rio turned in Agatha’s arms and deeper into her arms as they woke up slowly, letting her hand settle on her girlfriend’s stomach beneath her sleep shirt. Agatha’s warmth wrapped around her, making it impossible to believe that they were forced to leave their cocoon to join the reality that awaited them outside of their bubble. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not fair…” Rio murmured. “I don’t want to move.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmmm,” Agatha hummed in agreement.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>For a few minutes they ignored their pending responsibility and stole a few extra moments in each other’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, “I have to wake Nicky for school. What are you doing today?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I have a few meetings and things to do for work. I thought I would go to the coffee shop to work there for a bit. What time will you be home today?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We have rehearsals after school, but we’ll be done by six. Are you ready for school night drama? Nicky will have homework… we’re not really used to having guests over in the week…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t want to be in the way of their routine, but she wanted to be with Agatha. “I’m okay with it if you are. We don’t have to rush anything if you’re not ready, Agatha.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled at Rio, causing her heart to flutter. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“If you need me to back off a bit…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No please, I don’t want that. I just don’t want you to feel like you are unwelcome. I want you here, with me.” Agatha said, kissing her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Then I will be here.” Rio answered between kisses.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, Agatha got up to wake Nicky and Rio hurried back to the guest room to avoid Nicky seeing her in his mother’s bed. That conversation could be saved for another day, when Agatha was ready, for now she felt at ease, Agatha wanted her and she wanted Agatha. Their relationship was still very new, and there were so many things they still needed to talk about, but for now, she was happy to call her her girlfriend, even if it was just in the quiet comfort of each other’s arms.</span>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio settled into a corner booth in the Wiccan Brew and pulled out her laptop while she waited for her coffee order. She had a permanent smile on her face, way out of character for herself she thought. Her normal deadpan expression now overshadowed by the smile caused by the feeling of having Agatha in her life as her actual girlfriend. Who would have thought, the </span>
<em>
<span>Casanova</span>
</em>
<span> of Philadelphia falling hook, line and sinker for this woman.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her phone buzzed, waking her from her daydream. It was Natasha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nat: Have you already U-Hauled with Jen? We missed you at the bar this weekend. Don’t tell me you’re getting soft on me.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck… she forgot about her fake hookup with Jen. She will probably still need the cover if they need to spend more time together for </span>
<em>
<span>Project Darkhold.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: No U-Haul yet, just visiting</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She quickly typed a message to Jen, to cover all their bases, just in case.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: If Wanda asks, I was with you over the weekend and we are not U-Hauling </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen: Fuck no, I would rather die.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Thanks. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: By the way, you’d be lucky to sack up with me.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Jen: Not in this life, babe.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed, their frenemies relationship will be put to the test. They just needed to keep up this bizarre front until Agatha was safe. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Another message from Natasha buzzed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nat: Wanda’s planning your wedding already, I hope you like peach.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Tell your coppertop wife to back out of my love life.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nat: Wow, the L word already. I’ll help you pack when you get back from your love nest in NY.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Fuck off. I regret agreeing to be your friend.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Nat: You love me babe. When are you back? We need to catch up.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Dunno yet. I’ll text you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio locked her phone and focused on the pile of emails in her inbox. She had to at least try and get some work done. She just got her new promotion a few weeks ago and she still had a lot to prove to her boss.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As the empty coffee mugs gathered around her she finished her last meeting for the day. She heard the coffee shop’s door ring when Dottie walked in. Rio felt herself retreat deeper into the corner, hiding behind her baseball cap, hoping that Agatha’s nosy neighbor wouldn’t notice her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Unfortunately the coffee shop wasn’t very busy and Rio was spotted instantly. Rio smiled awkwardly at her, and turned her face back behind her laptop, hoping that Dottie would get the hint that she didn’t want to be disturbed. The blond woman smiled and narrowed her eyes, glaring suspiciously at Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck.</span>
</em>
<span> Rio thought. Alice hasn’t had any updates on Dottie and if she can be trusted so Rio had to improvise if the woman decided to approach her, which she did.</span>
</p><p>
<span>“Hello Agatha’s college friend,” Dottie said with a wide grin, unsettling Rio slightly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled, trying to hide her discomfort. “Hi,”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Still here I see. Has our little town of Westview charmed you enough to stay past the weekend?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess you could say that,” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sure,” Dottie took a seat at the table next to Rio. She sat her coffee mug down. Rio tried to avoid eye contact, but the woman was glaring and smiling, and honestly, it was starting to freak her out. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled out her phone and quickly sent a text to the </span>
<em>
<span>Project Darkhold </span>
</em>
<span>group chat.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: Fuck, Dottie has me cornered in the Wiccan. SOS. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Alice: I can be there in 30 minutes. Try to keep to yourself.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Rio: She’s nosy and freaking me out with her fucking smile.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie cleared her throat suddenly, snapping Rio back. “What are you working on there?” she asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn't know what she should tell the woman, but her unsettling smile told her that silence wasn’t going to make her go away. “I ah, work in landscaping. I’m finishing a garden design.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“In winter? Who gardens in winter?” Dottie asked accusingly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The project starts in spring, so don’t worry, no one is gardening in winter.” Rio answered plainly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>That seemed to shut Dottie up for a while, and Rio continued to avoid her. Unfortunately the woman seemed adamant to pry into her silence.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“How did you and Agatha even cross paths in college? I’m sure the history and gardening departments aren’t close on campus. Well that’s assuming you went to the same college.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt herself fumbling this conversation. She had no fucking clue what </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha’s</span>
</em>
<span> backstory was, how she got here, where she studied to be a history teacher and if Dottie knew, one misstep on Rio’s end could fuck up her story. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just before Rio could answer Alice stepped into the coffee shop. Rio let out a breath of relief. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, sorry I am late.” Alice greeted. She turned to Dottie and smiled as she sat down opposite Rio, blocking off Dottie with her back. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice mouthed something unreadable to Rio and gestured with her eyes to Dottie behind her. Rio rolled her eyes, this was ridiculous, she thought. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah Officer Wu, I didn’t know you two knew each other.” Dottie spoke over Alice’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice turned to Dottie, “Dottie, always a pleasure.” she smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It looks like our Aggie suddenly has quite the social life these days.” Dottie laughed. “Who knew, she’s always so… guarded. You always have to keep an eye on the quiet ones.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes flew up to Alice’s. This woman felt dodgy and she was obviously trying to snoop, for gossip or whatever her agenda was. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Maybe she just prefers privacy.” Alice said bitingly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie got up from her chair and flung her purse over her shoulder. “Privacy or secrecy, it’s all the same.” she said leaving the two. “Tell Aggie we’re all looking forward to the play. I hear it will be a great hit.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie left the coffee shop and a loaded silence fell over Rio and Alice as they watched her cross the street, calling someone on her phone. Nothing about this encounter felt good.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s dodgy right?” Rio asked Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s definitely snooping.” Alice said, taking a sip of Rio’s now cold coffee. “Urgh, what are you drinking?’ she said, almost spitting it out.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It was a long black, but now I guess it’s a cold brew.” Rio squinted, “but you are welcome to order your own, officer.” she said, grabbing her cup back.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stood up and placed an order for herself at the counter while Rio packed up her laptop and notebook. Alice returned with two fresh cups of coffee and placed one in front of Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay so, you actually got me at a great time, I just got intel on Mrs. Snoopsalot.” Alice said, sipping on her own mug now.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stared, waiting for the rest of Alice’s story.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Dottie..” Alice said as if Rio didn’t know who she was talking about.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I got that, thanks Alice.” Rio rolled her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, ok, same page then. So she moved in across the street from Agatha almost at the same time Agatha was placed here. So that is sus… but here is the kicker, I was able to get intel on her accounts, don’t ask, I now owe a gross amount of favors to Eddie, our IT intern at the precinct. Anyway, turns out, Mrs. Snoopy-dot-com has a monthly payment coming her way from a company called </span>
<em>
<span>Lilia’s Leggings.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck me! Lilia’s Leggings?” Rio yelled, “That cannot be a coincidence can it? Do we think it is the same Lilia?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“How many Lilias do you know?” Alice asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just the one.” Rio stated, “So what do you think the payments are for?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Based on the fact that she’s been getting them for the last ten years, I’d say surveillance. But I can’t tell you if it is surveillance for RB or if Lilia was merely keeping an eye on her for protection.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So say Lilia was keeping surveillance on Agatha for RB, why hasn’t Agatha’s cover been blown yet? If RB has guys on the outside and they knew where she was, why haven’t they done anything with her yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s the thing. Agatha said Lilia was like a mother to her. So what if Lilia was surveilling Agatha for protection?” Alice rubbed at her temples, thinking. “That would explain why Dottie has been snooping around you. I mean, it’s public knowledge by now that RB is getting out. If Dottie has been keeping an eye on Agatha for ten years, she’ll probably know everyone Agatha knows, so you showing up out of the blue, right after it’s announced that RB is getting out… that might have blipped their radar. I’d be suspicious too.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So Dottie suspects me, and we suspect her and Lilia.” Rio said to no one. “Has Lilia phoned Jen yet?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, she would have said, but I need to dig into Lilia a bit. See where her loyalties lie. I hope I’m not wrong, but I feel like she may be on our side.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope you’re not right either, because we now know that Lilia knows about Agatha, and if she has ties to the wrong people…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“…Agatha is fucked.” Alice finished Rio’s sentence.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment both of them stared at their empty coffee mugs. “Now, when do we tell Ags?” Alice asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She’s got a lot going on with the play… maybe we can do it after.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hopefully by then we’ll know if we can trust Lilia and Dottie.” Alice said with a cautious look.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Nicky climbed into the car in the school parking lot. Agatha had just finished the rehearsal for the school play while Nicky hung around in Maria’s classroom while she finished preparing for some science lessons.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom?” Nicky asked when they drove out of the parking lot. “When do you know you have a girlfriend?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze, her mind running through every minute Rio spent in their house while Nicky was home. Did he see or hear something? They were being careful, weren’t they?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Elaborate.” Agatha asked carefully.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I just… notice things.” Nicky said bluntly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck, busted…</span>
</em>
<span> “Like what?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky took a breath, “Say someone spends a lot of time with you…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Check</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“…and she laughs at your stupid jokes…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Check. And my jokes aren’t that stupid.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“…and when she thinks you don’t see, she’s smiling at you…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Yup, check. She’s fucked.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky, I wanted to tell…” Agatha started.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“But the thing is,” Nicky interrupted her. “She hasn’t said anything to me. So I don’t know… I think she…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wait, who are you talking about?” Agatha asked, confused, interrupting him suddenly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, have you even been listening? I’m having a real life crisis, here!” Nicky moaned.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You are seven, kid, the only crisis you should be having is where you left your shoes in your mess of a room.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, seriously, you haven’t answered my question. When do I know if Julie is my girlfriend or not?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed, dodged a bullet this time. “Have you asked her yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Julie? No…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t you think you have to ask her to be your girlfriend first?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled into the driveway. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you ask her?” Nicky asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha slammed the brakes a little too hard. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, what the hell?” Nicky yelled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry Nic… Who?” Agatha asked, a little startled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Who what?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You asked if I… who are you talking about Nicky?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, did you ask her to be your girlfriend? Before you got married. Honestly, you’re crazy tonight.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh, Maria!” Agatha said, relieved.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, duh, who else did you think I was talking about?” Nicky asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, no, you just… asked it weird. Let’s get inside, we can finish this conversation while I make dinner.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Nicky walked into the house. A delicious smell hung in the air and they followed it in a daze towards the kitchen where Rio was standing behind the stove stirring a pot.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh hey,” Rio said, spinning around. Agatha felt her knees buckle slightly at the sight. Rio had an apron over her white tank top, with her toned arms on display. Her face was dusted with flour and her hair was up in a loose bun. She looked adorable and sexy at the same time and it took everything in Agatha to not jump her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thought I’d make dinner while you two were on your way.” Rio smiled. Agatha’s heart flipped in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It smells amazing, what is it?” Nicky suddenly asked from behind Agatha, startling her out of her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks kid, it’s nothing special, just something I was craving. Do you like tacos?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah!” Nicky said. “I have them all the time, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s never had tacos.” Agatha said laughing and rolling her eyes at the smart ass kid.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re kidding?” Rio said bluntly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, maybe I haven’t, but whatever tacos are , O want ten. It smells so good!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and turned to take the pot off the stove.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky, go put your stuff in your room, then we can eat when you get back, okay?” Rio smiled, wiping her face and inadvertently smudging her face even more.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky laughed up at her. “You uh, got something on your face, Rio.” he said, running to his room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as Nicky was out of sight, Agatha stepped closer to Rio, grabbing a clean cloth on her way. “You are covered in… taco.” Agatha laughed. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hands rested on Agatha’s hips. Agatha leaned in to her, kissing her slowly. “You look absolutely adorable like this by the way.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry, I’m not really a neat chef.” Rio admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked around. Like Rio, the kitchen was covered in flour and sauce. “I’ve noticed.” Agatha laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio leaned in to kiss her again, Agatha got lost in the kiss almost forgetting about the excited seven year old in the house.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just then Nicky came running back. Agatha and Rio jumped away from each other, Rio’s eyes never leaving Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>“Let's eat.” Rio said, carrying the food to the table. Agatha smiled a warm smile up at Rio from the dining table, a </span>

<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>To say that Agatha was whipped was an understatement. A little over two weeks have passed since Rio reappeared in her life, and only five actual days of those two weeks were spent with Rio here with her in Westview, yet Agatha felt a pull toward her she had absolutely no explanation for. Her thoughts were consumed with Rio, her eyes, her laugh, her lips, her mouth, her hands, </span>
<em>
<span>okay calm down Agatha…</span>
</em>
<span>. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She was so down bad for Rio that nothing else made sense but her. All the times Agatha imagined her life after Maria she imagined her growing old in Westview, watching Nicky grow up while she spent the rest of her personal life in comfortable independence. All that changed the moment Rio appeared in a blur with Heart in the background in front of Tony’s karaoke stage.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s vines crept into her soul and wound itself around her heart and infiltrated every inch of her being. Agatha’s dreams of her future hovered in limbo, teetering between what she had accepted to be her fate and what she now wished and hoped for. Now her dreams were filled with a warm gap toothed smile and soft brown eyes waking her in the morning. Soft lips kissing her on the way to drop Nicky off at school and strong, comforting arms held her while tears of pride rolled down her face as Nicky graduates from college. Then later as time moves on, she sits on the patio staring out at the garden, living and breathing with life and beauty, lovingly nurtured and tended to by Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ms. H?” Billy askes, snapping her out of her day dream. Fuck, she was in the middle of class and drifting off like a love struck teenager. Billy was standing in front of the class, right after probably finishing his presentation to class about something she didn’t even catch. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, right, thank you Billy for your </span>
<em>
<span>very interesting</span>
</em>
<span> presentation of your assignment on…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The Stonewall Riots…” Billy sneered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, Stonehenge, right. Thank you Billy.” Agatha lied.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Stonewall…” Billy huffed his annoyance and stomped back to his desk. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The bell rang and Agatha thanked whichever god was responsible for finally ending the class. “We’ll finish the rest of the presentations tomorrow. Please make sure your assignments are on my desk by tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The class got up and siphoned though the door as Agatha sat back down at her desk. Billy stayed behind, because of course he did.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ms. H, are you okay?” Billy asked curiously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, why would you ask that?” Agatha answered, completely oblivious to the fact that she basically daydreamed her way through 45 minutes of her students’ history assignments.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, you basically stared at the wall smiling like a lunatic throughout my whole presentation. Nothing about my presentation should have earned that reaction, Stonewall is serious and you sat there like I was presenting a slide show about Care Bears.”  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t be dramatic, Teen. I was just… listening intently.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Billy narrowed his eyes. Suddenly he sprung up out of his chair and widened his eyes, “Oh my god, don’t tell me. You and that hot mysterious lady…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“If you finish that sentence I will bury you.” Agatha warned.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just saying Ms. H, that’s the look of something whipped. And I am not talking about the cream on a Frappuccino.” Billy said. “You Ms. H, are in love and it looks like my grades will suffer the consequences.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha glared at him, of course he was right, but she was not going to admit it to him of all people. “Just leave your assignment on my desk and get out. The next class is about to start and you cannot afford another trip to the principal’s office for tardiness.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The lady doth protest too much…” Billy sang as he skipped out of her class. She would kill him one day. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The rest of the school day passed in a similar fashion. Her only saving grace was that the students in the rest of her classes didn’t seem to care that their teacher zoned out for most of the class. She did however kick herself for now having to read through about 60 assignments to actually grade the losers on their work. Serves her right for being a lovestruck moron, she thought. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked, no floated, to her car after school. Mrs. Davis cancelled tonight's final rehearsal for the play so as to not over rehearse the kids. Something about having raw emotion on stage… whatever. That meant, she had a free afternoon to spend with Nicky and Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she was about to open her car door to get in, she heard Maria call after her. </span>
<em>
<span>Fuck</span>
</em>
<span>, she suddenly remembered, Maria and Mel were coming for dinner and she totally fucking forgot, again!</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Ags, we’re still on for tonight’s dinner? Alice said she’s bringing a date. Jen, I think she said?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could kick her own ass if it were even possible. Jump off a cliff and have the earth swallow her whole. How did she forget about tonight’s dinner? Now Alice </span>
<em>
<span>and </span>
</em>
<span>Jen will be there </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> her ex and her ex’s girlfriend and to put the cherry on top of her already complicated lesbian parfait, </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> new girlfriend which no one really knew about yet. Fuck fuck fuck.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags? Are you even listening to me?” Maria asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah sorry, dinner. With Alice and Jen. And you and Mel… Nicky and…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Are we expecting anyone else? I just need to know for catering purposes.” Maria said plainly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Okay well, here goes. Band-Aids are meant to be ripped off…</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“One more.” Agatha said quickly, hoping Maria would leave it at that. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria counted on her fingers. “No, that's six people. Unless…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Seven. Just… we’re going to be seven, and no, there’s no need to make a big deal out of it. I certainly am not, so just seven and that's it. Okay, see you tonight.” Agatha said, closing the door on Maria. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched Maria’s face light up in realization, but before Agatha had to explain anything further, she sped off to pick up Nicky. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*********</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Too many things were running around in Agatha’s head. She had a whole coven of nosy lesbians coming her way in less than two hours and Rio would be there too. And as what? Her friend from college or girlfriend. Dammit, she was spinning and spiraling all at once. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky babbled about school all the way home, distracted enough to miss the fact that his mom was having a massive internal spiral while trying to keep the car on the road. Pulling into her driveway she saw the all familiar big black Range Rover parked beside her. She relaxed at the realization that Rio was still here. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky ran into the house the minute the door opened. “Rio! Guess what?” he yelled excitedly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey bud, what has you so hyped up?” she asked, looking up at Agatha from the sofa with her laptop cradled in her lap. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her spinning head pause at the warm smile beaming in her direction. She let out a sigh and felt her shoulders ease just a bit. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom said I can play games while they have dinner tonight…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky baby. Please, inside voice.” Agatha asked Nicky who was practically yelling in Rio’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry mom.” He said in a quieter voice. He turned back to Rio to continue his conversation, “You can join me, you know, mom’s dinners are </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> boring, they only talk about grown up stuff anyway, and no one ever brings up dinosaurs.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You know that I am a grown up too, right?” Rio said laughing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, but you’re… cool.” Nicky said, shrugging his shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a genuine laugh, raising a proud eyebrow at Agatha, “Thanks little man.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky, go start with your homework before everyone comes please, I need to get ready for those uncool grown up stuff, I guess.” Agatha said, defeatedly waving her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky went to his room to start with his homework. Agatha slowly walked to Rio and sat down next to her, who still had her laptop open on her lap.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Agatha said, kissing Rio softly on the lips. “What are you working on?” Agatha asked, leaning her head on Rio’s shoulder. Rio turned to her and kissed the top of her head.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just some rich guy’s holiday home garden design. These are the worst clients, no plants or intricate designs, just grass… might as well be an overpriced driving range. Rich people have no taste.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed quietly and sighed against Rio’s shoulder. “I fucked up.” She said, squeezing her eyes shut.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Rio asked hesitantly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re sort of having a dinner party here tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I gathered… but how did you fuck up?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well Alice and Jen will be here…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, so? That’s okay right?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And Mariaandmel.” She said, hiding her face behind her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh… </span>
<em>
<span>riiiight</span>
</em>
<span>.” Rio said with a hesitant smile.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I just haven't told them about you really, well they know of you. I sort of let it slip last week that I was on a date with one of Jen’s friends.” Agatha started to explain.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you’re a grown woman, you are allowed to date, aren’t you?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, I know… but it’s just Nicky.” Agatha said quietly, turning to see if he was in earshot of them. “I haven’t dated anyone since the divorce, and I just don’t want to…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Ags,” Rio said cupping her face, “I get it okay, we’ll keep it between us for now, until you are ready. I told you there was no rush.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s heart warmed and she smiled lovingly at Rio. “I’m sorry, it’s not that I want to hide you, I just… I really like you and I don’t want to mess this up.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We have time. You can tell him when you are ready. I can behave.” Rio smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s lip curled and she raised an eyebrow, “Sure…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stepped out of the guest room, dressed casually, but stylish in black jeans and a green button up shirt. She straightened her shirt and looked up to see Agatha dressed in a long black dress with her chest healthily on display, more than it should be for this time of year. She walked up to her standing in the kitchen and hugged her from behind. “You expect me to behave when you look like this. It’s not fair, you know.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned in her arms, quickly scanning the room to see if Nicky was around. When the coast was clear, she kissed Rio slowly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You don’t look too innocent yourself, hon.” she teased, taking a step back from Rio and eyeing her up and down.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio gave her another look, taking in the way the dress hung on her frame, her cheeks suddenly feeling warmer than it did before. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>There was a knock on the door. “That’ll be Alice and Jen. Do you mind opening up for them, while I check on Nicky?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio nodded her head and walked to open the front door, only as luck would have it, it wasn’t Alice and Jen.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, hi?” Maria greeted, smiling surprised at the unknown woman. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi, you must be Maria and Mel?” Rio said, holding out a hand to greet them. “Rio…” she said. She turned, looking around awkwardly, “Uhm Agatha is just checking on Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria and Mel were grinning at her as they stared. Rio simply stared back smiling. Time seemed to tick by slower than necessary and this was already too awkward, but luckily Agatha ran to the door to save her from herself.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, please come in.” she said, from behind Rio. “Rio, this is Maria and Mel. My ah… Nicky’s mother and her… Mel.” Agatha laughed nervously. Rio laughed with her, it was strange seeing Agatha so flustered suddenly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p><span>Maria laughed and nodded to Mel. They shared a look, obviously in on the same joke. “Ah, the mysterious </span><em><span>date…” </span></em><span>Maria teased,</span> <span>“Nice to meet you, Rio. Agatha has told us nothing fun about you.” Agatha rolled her eyes at Maria in response. </span></p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags, you didn’t tell us she was this gorgeous…” Maria continued as she walked past them into the house.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grinned at Agatha who was now turning a shade of red she’s never seen. She squeezed Agatha’s hand secretly, earning a warm smile from her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh god, we’re in for a long night.” Agatha sighed, rolling her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Right behind them Jen and Alice finally showed up and Rio felt some ease settle over her. At least she had some familiar faces here tonight.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just in time for the show, I see.” Alice said giggling. Rio greeted her with a smirk. Rio saw Jen looking nervous, also a first. “Jen,” Rio greeted, as they walked into Agatha’s house.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After Maria came back from greeting Nicky, Agatha handed everyone their drinks and the three pairs settled in the lounge. Alice introduced Jen to Maria and Mel and the four of them fell into easy conversation, leaving Rio and Agatha, sitting closely next to each other, sipping their wine in silence. Somewhere in the house Rio could hear the music coming from the game Nicky was playing and Rio suddenly wished she agreed to hide out with him.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>In all honesty, Rio didn’t feel too awkward surrounded by Agatha’s friends and ex wife, she never really cared what other people thought, but she could feel Agatha sitting stiffly next to her, unsure of how the evening with her friends, ex-wife and new girlfriend would play out.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So, two new faces in Westview.” Maria teased, smiling deviously at Melinda. “We’re happy to see someone finally snapping up our Aggie and Officer Wu here. We were worried that we’d come to find the two of them sneaking around behind our backs. </span>
<em>
<span>That</span>
</em>
<span> would have been a disaster.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Alice both choked on their drinks. Maria and Mel started laughing along.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, you know I love you right?” Alice said, “But it really</span>
<em>
<span> would</span>
</em>
<span> be a disaster.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, I am a catch!” Agatha teased back. “But you are right… that would be like kissing my weird sister.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, I am a great kisser, just ask Jen!” Alice said proudly. It was Jen’s turn to choke on her drink.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“A lady never kisses and tells.” Jen remarked once she recovered, blushing a bit.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh but do tell…” Maria said, taking a healthy sip of her wine.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please, no, we don’t need the details.” Agatha said laughing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Like we haven’t seen the two of you sucking face in Tony’s parking lot for the past two weekends.” Alice teased.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ooooooh, busted.” Maria and Mel teased in unison. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Shhh,” Agatha hissed, nudging her head towards Nicky’s room. “Let’s keep it down for the seven year old please.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed silently, but felt the lightest pang of fear in her chest at Agatha’s quick dismissal. As if Agatha could feel Rio’s body react to the conversation, her hand settled on Rio’s thigh. Rio nervously looked down and snapped her head back up to find Maria’s eyes falling to where Agatha’s hand rested.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Relax, hon.” Agatha whispered with a wink. Rio turned to Agatha and found her smiling at her. She eased a bit more into the sofa. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Maria, let’s not scare them away, yet. This might be good, we wouldn’t need to babysit the two of them so much anymore.” Melinda warned, playfully nudging Maria.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I guess, but I must admit, Agatha, this is quite fast for you. If I remember correctly, you were always the hard to get type.” Maria said, hinting to Agatha’s hand on Rio’s thigh. Rio stirred but Agatha’s hand never left her leg. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s been ten years coming.” Jen said suddenly and everyone’s eyes darted to her. Agatha’ in particular almost fell out of her head.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ten years?” Melinda asked, looking back at Maria confused.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Fuck, </span>
</em>
<span>Rio thought, of course Jen would be the one to fuck this up.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, we all know each other from college and I guess our paths just crossed again, this time just at the right time.” Agatha tried to explain, sending heated daggers in Jen’s direction.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>From the other side of the room, Rio saw Melinda looking intently at her, summing her up and probably trying to piece the new information together with what she thought she knew about Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Before anything else was said on the matter, Alice bounced up from the sofa, “Well, let’s get this dinner we’ve been waiting for, I am starving.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt Agatha tremble slightly next to her. The subject of Agatha’s past was now too close for comfort.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria went to get Nicky for dinner, while the others made their way to the dinner table where the food was set out. Rio held Agatha back before joining the others, “Are you okay?” she asked quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, let’s just get dinner out of the way.” Agatha sighed softly. Rio could see that this was already difficult, so she gently squeezed Agatha’s hand in hers. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just let me know and we can make a run for it. I am great at faking emergencies.” she joked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed softly, “I might keep you to it.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***************</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After dinner Maria and Mel greeted everyone goodbye and Rio had to admit that she had a good time, even if most of the night was spent counting her words carefully and being cautious about not getting too close to Agatha in front of Nicky. Maria and Mel welcomed her into their inner circle with open arms, Rio could see the warm family Agatha had around her, bringing her some comfort in knowing that Agatha wasn’t as isolated in her displacement as she could have been, given the circumstances. And despite Maria and Agatha’s shared history, she could see their relationship was now based on care and friendship. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Jen stayed behind for a nightcap and Agatha went to get Nicky ready for bed. It was a school night after all. Rio sat back on the sofa and nursed a beer which had already started to warm in her hands. Alice and Jen sat cuddled together on the opposite sofa. Rio felt like the biggest third wheel, wishing for Agatha to return to her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So lovebirds, when is the wedding?” Rio teased.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t joke, Rio. And honestly, I could ask you the same.” Jen snarled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed it off. It sounded ridiculous, but Rio couldn’t help the idea of it suddenly filling her thoughts. “I just survived my first coven dinner, let’s not jump to those conclusions yet.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha finally returned from Nicky’s room and fell onto the sofa next to Rio. She sat closer than before, draping her arm behind Rio’s shoulder. “Okay, that was exhausting. Alice please, I cannot keep forgetting about these dinners. You need to remind me more often please.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice laughed, “Ags, I am your keeper who happens to like you enough to be your friend, not your personal assistant. And you are a big girl, you know you have a calendar on your phone to keep track of these things.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. “I’ve been… distracted.” She winked at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Annnd, that’s our cue.” Jen said, slapping Alice’s leg. “I have already been a witness to what happens after one of those winks and I am not drunk enough for that tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed. “Oh Jen, always the prude.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Prude? I beg to differ…” Alice started, but Jen had her hand slapped over Alice’s mouth to keep her from speaking further. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go, Al.” Jen smirked. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio walked the two out the front door to say their goodbyes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll see you at the play tomorrow night.” Alice said, waving at them.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned on Rio’s shoulder as they waved back, watching the car disappear out of the driveway. Agatha turned to Rio and pressed a quick kiss to her cheek. “Well done on surviving tonight and thank you, really. This bunch tends to be relentless with newcomers.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I had fun, promise. Maria is great, I am happy you have her as a friend. And Mel, she is a bit intense, but I can see you have good people here, Ags.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I do…” Agatha lingered for a moment, “Let’s get inside, I am freezing. I hope you know I am sneaking into your bed again tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I hoped you would.” Rio said, kissing Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha walked past Rio into the house and just as Rio was about to do the same, a window across the street caught her eye. Dottie.</span>
</p>

<p>Chapter Summary</p>

</div>
<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
<p>
<span>Lilia sat in the dim light of her office. Dottie just sent the latest photos of Agatha, again she was seen with Rio. She stared at them displayed on the screen in front of her. She spun her pen in her fingers deep in thought. The girl seemed harmless and posed no threat to Agatha, that’s to say if she doesn’t blow her cover.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The glass door of her office opened, Wanda walked in with purpose and sat down on the chair in front of her desk, placing a thick folder on the table. “Lilia, we need to go over the Lochlan case before you leave.” Wanda said from opposite her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia quickly turned the screen away from Wanda, just in case. “Wanda, you’re still here? I’ll probably be back from New Jersey by Friday, but sure, I can look over them while I’m in the car. You know how I despise travelling by car, the files will keep me from losing my mind.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you doing in New Jersey anyway? Do we have a client…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just checking in on an investment.” Lilia interrupted. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Wanda narrowed her eyes slightly. “I didn’t know the firm had any investments in New Jersey.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s more of a personal investment.” Lilia stated bluntly. She was already giving away too much. “It’s not… firm related anyway. Some old family things need… tying up, that’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Always so mysterious, Lilia.” Wanda said, shrugging as she stood up again. “But yes, it’s getting late and I should leave before I’m stuck here for another all-nighter. Nat will kill me someday I am sure.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia waited for Wanda to leave her office and turned her screen back. She opened her VPN and logged into profile on the messenger site. Another unread message flickered in her inbox.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Salemite: I know I have you by the throat, Old Hag. I trust you’ll know keeping this from me will not be in your best interest.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia sneered at the message. So much for good intentions. Loyalty was a bitch and this is where it has left her now. Since her days in college Evanora was her friend and confidant. She was a ruthless bitch but Lila respected that. They started their practice together on a whim after winning a high profile case together, right after they graduated. It was pure luck, but from the success of that case they were able to build a powerful empire together. Unfortunately power and money turned her friend into something evil, dark and unrecognizable. The only thing she ever did to resemble something human was bear a beautiful child. Agnes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora was a terror of a mother, raising her daughter with fear and resentment, but as her godmother, Lilia loved Agnes as if she were her own. Where Evanora raised a hand, Lilia held hers out in comfort afterwards. Agnes had a home in her heart and she would have done anything for that girl. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Soon, Evanora’s clients turned more and more violent as the years went on, but years of loyalty and also keeping contact with Agnes kept Lilia from breaking all ties with the evil witch. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It was that loyalty that kept Lilia from leaving Evanora for the wolves after the last trial went south. She reluctantly helped her disappear with the only trade being that Evanora forgot about Agnes and never attempted to make contact with her or Lilia again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>So fucking much for that, under the guise of a pseudonym on a dark web chat site, Evanora was alive and well, and clearly still under the thumb of the one person who threatened her own blood, her own daughter.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Evil had no soul, and Evanora was evil to the core. The news of her client Ralph being released had Evanora‘s dirty signature written all over it. Only she had the evil contacts to get a judge to reduce a life sentence to ten years. Pathetic men were easy to find, and Evanora knew just how to get them to bend at her will, no matter the consequences for the innocent lives involved.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Now she had a problem. Evanora had something on her, something that would kill the career and life she built, and she was intent on using it to get to Agnes. For years Lilia had kept Agnes under her eye. Protecting her new identity and her location. Dottie, her paid informant, was annoying as hell, but necessary.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Every newcomer in the small town of Westview was investigated and cleared and those that could not be trusted were run out of town as quietly as possible. It pained her to only see Agnes’s life from afar. To see her grow up into the woman she was now, living a happy new life she could be proud of with a family and friends she loved, safe from harm. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It was no surprise that Evanora reached out on the day Ralph’s release broke the news. Clearly her client’s debts needed to be paid with Evanora ready to swipe the figurative card.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Late that evening as she watched the news of his release on the television, an unknown number sent her a text with a link to a chat site. Evanora, or as she was known on the dark web </span>

<span>Salemite</span>
</em>
<span> reached out to Lilia. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Salemite: Remember 2015. Ah… The summer of lies. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Queen of Cups: Who is this?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Salemite: Oh you’ll remember soon, old hag.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Old hag” Evanora’s callous pet name for Lilia. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Queen of Cups: We agreed, no contact.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Salemite: Time to pay out or pay the consequences. I remember a certain debt you owe. If you want to keep the bones in the grave where they were buried, you’ll cooperate. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Queen of Cups: You have nothing.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Salemite: I have EVERYTHING. If you think I will blink in hesitation you are wrong. Give me what I want and you keep your cushy life. Ignore me and it is over. I heard prison is hard on old hags like you. No one likes a baby killer.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia winced at the memory. A drunken night of celebration ending in tragedy. Evanora cleaned it up and wrapped it all in a pretty little bow. An innocent life taken and another innocent life sat behind bars, eventually succumbing to a life in prison, brutally murdered for killing a child. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>That should have been Lilia, but the fear of losing everything led her to believe that Evanora’s cover up will take everything away. The guilt however, that stayed. It festered in her. She would live with the blood of two innocent lives on her hands till her death, now Evanora was using it against her to get to Agnes.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>So that’s where Lilia found herself tonight. Another threat from Evanora. Either she gives up Agnes’s location or she gives up her life as she knows it. If she were really honest with herself, going to prison to protect Agnes wasn’t something she wouldn’t do. She was close to retiring anyway and Lilia Calderu was many things, but she wasn’t a rat.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Salemite: You have until the end of the week Old Hag. And don’t think I will not get what I want the hard way.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia slammed her laptop screen closed. Fuck that witch. She needed to find out whatever hold Ralph had on Evanora and she had to see for herself that Agatha remained under proper protection and surveillance. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Working as a defense lawyer had its privileges, even if some of their clients scraped the bottom of the barrel when it came to morals and ethics. One of her clients was a hacker who single handedly pulled off one of the biggest online money heists of the decade and with Lilia’s council, got off scot-free, no actual evidence strong enough to keep him out of prison for the rest of his life.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As a favor, he would occasionally help Lilia with cases, digging where her regular investigators could never reach. Lilia pulled out the burner phone she had hidden in her drawer and dialed his number.</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<em>
<span>”Lilia.” the voice greeted sternly.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Anything yet? She made contact again, I don’t think we have time to waste anymore.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“There’s a small trace. There has been money moving around some accounts barely connected to her. She’s smart but not smart enough. I found an offshore account tracing back to the name Verona Roo Conan, and it’s active, money being sent back and forth.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“</span>
</em>
<span>Verona Roo Conan… is that…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“An anagram for Evanora O’Connor? Definitely.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“</span>
</em>
<span>So it’s money. She’s selling her daughter’s life for fucking money.” Lilia said angrily. Evanora has sunk to the bottom of humanity. “And that’s it? No other ties.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Nothing else, but I’ll keep digging.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia ended the call. Money, it was always money. No surprises there. Fucking Evanora O’Connor. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She packed up her things to leave the office for the night. Her driver was ready to take her home and tomorrow she’ll be traveling to Westview to check on Agatha like she did every year close to the anniversary of her relocation. Lilia never made contact, always checking in from a safe distance. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Only this time she had other interests too. Q, her safety net. When Agnes went into witness protection she had a keeper assigned to her, some cop, but Lilia needed to make sure Agnes was safe. So she hired Q, a former black ops agent retired from the military, to stay close enough to Agatha to keep her safe. Q was focused and trained to handle any real threat should it be necessary.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Sure, Dottie was doing a fine job of keeping Lilia informed on Agatha’s life, as annoying as she could be, but Lilia always had a backup plan, and with Evanora on the hunt, she had to make sure that all bases were covered. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia climbed in her car telling her driver to take her home. She pulled out her phone to send a message to Q.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Lilia: ETA 9:00 Tomorrow, Let's meet at the Safe House</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Q: Got it. I’ll be there </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Lilia: Anything we need to be prepared for?</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Q: New faces still here, so far no trouble yet. Clear for now. </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Lilia: Good. We have a lot to discuss to prepare for the release. </span>

<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Why am I so nervous? </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha thought, biting on her thumb nail. If her mother were here she’d slap her hand out of her mouth in a second. Agatha stood in the wings of the stage watching the characters of Christian and Satine sing the horribly butchered version of the Elephant Love Medley. The audience seemed less phased at the </span>
<em>
<span>unsexy</span>
</em>
<span> lyrics and altered dialogue.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>From behind the curtains she could see Rio, Alice, Jen and Nicky watching the play from the audience. Mel and Maria sat in the row behind them and Maria clearly enjoyed every second of it, as she sang along excitedly. Occasionally Agatha and Rio made eye contact. Rio winked at her, stopping her heart from beating for a moment. She waved back shyly, Rio’s adorable smirk hitting her like an arrow straight through her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nearing the end of the play Agatha stole one last look at the audience, her eyes naturally drawn to Rio like a magnet. Behind her, Melinda leaned over to Maria, whispering something and stood up, making her way to the back of the auditorium, probably to use the restrooms.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The finale of the play echoed in the auditorium and the audience roared with applause. Billy took a proud bow next to his costars and Mrs. Davis, who trotted towards the front of the stage, as the applause roared loudly. Agatha smiled proudly from where she was standing and saw them call out to her to join. Awkwardly she walked out to the front of the stage where the rest of the cast and the other teachers lined up for the final curtain call. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>In unison they bowed forward and when she stood back up she froze for a second. At the back of the auditorium she saw Melinda talking to an older woman, for a brief second she could have swore she was Lilia, but the figure disappeared through the doors before she could be sure. Coincidence, she thought. Westview was riddled with old people and that was probably one of the student's grandmothers.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Shaking off the weird feeling in her chest she bowed again with the cast and left the stage. Celebrations were in full swing backstage and she hugged the students proudly. Somehow they made this unsexy Moulin Rouge a hit with the audience.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ms. H, I think this was our best play yet! The audience really </span>
<em>
<span>loved </span>
</em>
<span>it!” Billy cheered proudly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You did good, teen!” Agatha smiled at him, patting his shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha left the backstage area to meet with her friends and Nicky. Behind a huge bouquet of flowers stood her son, beaming up at her as if she hung the moon herself, which she technically did. That big ass paper mâché moon hanging over the stage was a real bitch to hang. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>He ran up to her, “Break a leg Mom!” he exclaimed proudly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The group of women behind him burst out in laughter, “You were supposed to say that before the play, bud.” Rio said. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well I didn’t see her before, so…” Nicky shrugged.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks baby,” Agatha smiled, kissing the top of his head. “These flowers are beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio helped me choose them, these mean good luck,” he said pointing at the sunflowers in the bouquet.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled up at Rio, her heart did a flip in her chest when she winked back at her. Nicky looked very pleased with himself, and Agatha gave him another big hug in appreciation.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The group later met up at Maria’s house for dinner after the play, since her house was the closest. They ordered a bunch of pizzas and settled around the dinner table when they arrived. Agatha sat opposite Mel and awkwardly caught her eye every now and then. The image of her talking to the older lady in the back of the auditorium played in her head over and over. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Stirring her out of her thoughts, she felt a reassuring hand take hers under the table. She turned to Rio and smiled warmly. Rio’s bright smile beamed back at her, drowning out the chatter and laughter around the table. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky laid passed out on the sofa after dinner. They sat at the table enjoying the last of the drinks and dessert.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It wasn’t </span>
<em>
<span>that </span>
</em>
<span>bad.” Alice said eventually. “I actually think you did well, considering some of the lyrics didn’t make sense in context, but I guess it </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> a school play. I don’t know what the prudes of Westview’s PTA would do if you stuck to the whole </span>
<em>
<span>courtesan</span>
</em>
<span> storyline.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Everyone around me loved it, even Mel looked like she did.” Maria teased, nudging her girlfriend’s shoulder with hers. “You missed the big ending though.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I had to take a call, but I did catch the last few notes.” Mel said, with a smile that didn’t really reach her eyes. Agatha narrowed her eyes, she was being more guarded than usual.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Who was it?” Agatha suddenly asked. The sudden confrontation surprised herself too.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags, you know Mel’s work has no end some days.” Maria said, defending her girlfriend.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Melinda stared at Agatha surprised but with a straight face. Agatha was almost glaring at her. “And that older woman… Who was that?” she asked again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The table went silent, all eyes were now fixed on Melinda. “Some old lady wanted to know where the restrooms were, that's all.” Melinda said plainly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The atmosphere around the table changed instantaneously. Agatha knew that she was probably making something out of nothing, but Mel was acting strangely and the woman she saw felt too familiar, as impossible as it may be.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Step off, Ags.” Maria said, warning her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone now stared at Agatha, the sudden confrontation with Melinda was very out of character, but Agatha somehow felt she couldn’t let it go. She looked at Maria in disbelief, “It was just a question, the woman looked like someone I know, that’s all.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s a small town, you know this. It was probably just a grandparent…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Melinda suddenly stood up from the table, “I really don’t have to explain myself to you Agatha. Maria, I think I’m turning in.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The table fell silent again, and Agatha felt eyes burning into her. “Why is this such a big deal to you Agatha, fuck, you always do this.” Maria said, running after Mel.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit.” Agatha said quietly, her head falling into her hands. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags, who did you think you saw?” Jen asked quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know, maybe Lilia.” Agatha said into her hands. “It’s impossible, right? No one besides you two know I’m here.” Agatha lifted her head from her hands. “Oh, I’m not sure. There was just something about her… I can’t put my finger on it.” Agatha sighed frustratingly. ”Fuck…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Babe, maybe we should go? It’s been a long day…” Rio said, rubbing comforting circles on her back. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled, her eyes filled with tears, “Okay, I’ll get Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it would be best to leave him here with me, he’s already sleeping.” Maria said, coming back into the dining room. “</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha met Maria’s eyes, she couldn’t help feeling like an absolute asshole. “Listen, Maria. Please tell Mel I’m… sorry. I shouldn’t have…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, you’re overthinking this. But that was uncalled for Agatha, just… we’ll talk at school tomorrow”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*********</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Back home in her kitchen, Agatha filled a vase with water to put the bouquet of flowers in. Rio sat quietly behind the kitchen island.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned around and met Rio’s eyes, they were filled with concern. “Do you want to talk about it?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed, “I know I probably look crazy, but I swear, for a moment it really looked like Lilia.” Agatha walked around the kitchen island to sit next to Rio. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Why do you think it would be her? Does she know you are here?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No… I don’t know… Maybe. Lilia knows the right people, but I could be wrong. And now, I have made Mel out to be some secret spy or something.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you think she could be telling the truth… about getting a call?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“As far as I know, Mel is some sort of consultant for an insurance firm’s fraud department. We always joked that she’s actually a spy…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So why would you suddenly think that she would be lying to you.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know… She’s always been secretive about her work, I’ve never cared about it because she is good to Maria and Nicky, and I’ve never really had reason not to trust her, but tonight… the way she was talking to that lady… that was more than just a </span>
<em>
<span>“where is the ladies room” </span>
</em>
<span>conversation. That looked… transactional.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay… so what do you think? Can Alice help… to look into her or something.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked at Rio, her shoulders sagged in exhaustion. “I don’t know. Am I being a dick about this? Why would Mel know Lilia? And why do I suddenly not trust my own friends?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, “ Rio said cupping her face, “You had to leave your entire life behind. Your own mother threw you to the fucking wolves, if you are worried about trusting people…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s not that I don’t trust her… she’ll hate me when she finds out, and Maria…” Agatha stared off into the living room for a moment. “I need to talk to Alice.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, I’ll call her.” Rio said, squeezing Agatha’s hand in hers. “We’ll figure this out.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“...I know it’s late Al, but Agatha needs you here.” Rio said over the phone. She looked over at Agatha sitting quietly in the living room staring at the cup of tea getting cold next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“They’ll be here in a few minutes.” Rio assured Agatha as she sat down next to her. “Can I get you anything?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha said softly. “You’ve been so amazingly sweet to me.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I said I will be here if you need me, Ags. I am not going anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This is a mess. I am a fucking mess.” Agatha said. Rio tugged her closer into a hug and kissed her forehead. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Babe, please, just keep breathing, we’ll get to the bottom of this. No one will lay a finger on you or Nicky, not while I’m here.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio saw teary blue eyes staring up at her. She smiled warmly at Agatha and wiped a stray tear from her cheek. “I’ve got you.” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A knock on the door startled them out of the quiet moment they were sharing. Rio walked over to open the door. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Is she okay?” Alice asked, her normally friendly demeanor replaced with what Rio could only assume is her Officer Wu voice.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, she’s in the living room.” Rio said, letting Alice and Jen in.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You girls are keeping me from my beauty sleep, again.” Jen murmured at Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry Jen, this was a bit of an emergency.” Rio said, closing the door behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, Ags, lay it on me. What happened?” Alice asked, her voice turned down and serious.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know I made a scene tonight at dinner, but Al… it was her. I am almost sure of it. That woman Mel was talking to was Lilia. The more I think about it….” Agatha said carefully. “Am I going crazy here?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags, no you’re not crazy. But what would she be doing here and why would she be meeting with Mel at school? Isn’t she like an insurance consultant?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s the thing, Al. I can’t help but feel that since you’ve told me about RB, I have been looking over my shoulder and doubting everything...”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Alice shared a look. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I think it might be time guys…” Jen said finally.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Time? What are you talking about Jen?” Agatha said confused.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took Agatha’s hand. “Babe, we’ve…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, wait.” Alice interrupted. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No Alice, she deserves to know.” Rio said firmly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck is going on?” Agatha shouted. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, please, don’t freak out, okay…” Alice started.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice, just fucking tell me…” Agatha spat.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay. This may explain everything or raise more questions, I am not sure yet…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Spit it out, Alice.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice took a breath and started talking. “Lilia has been surveilling you. Since you’ve moved here. We think it is for protection. I don’t know what she’s doing in town tonight, but I think it is safe to say that she knows where you are.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We?” Agatha asked wide eyed. Rio could feel the betrayal seep through Agatha’s body as she suddenly let go of Rio’s hand. “You knew?” Agatha asked Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I…” Rio started to explain.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You knew about Lilia, you all knew, and what? You made the decision for me that I needed to be kept in the dark like a fucking fool?” Rio saw the bitterness in Agatha’s eyes. “How long has this been going on, Rio?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags,” Rio said softly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“How long, Rio?” Agatha bit.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Since last week I think.” Rio admitted. Rio watched Agatha jump up and away from her, her eyes filling with tears as she stared at Rio. Was this betrayal? Definitely, Rio thought. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio winced at the look Agatha was giving her, “Baby, please, we were trying to help you, to protect you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You all know what I have lost, what I stand to lose if anyone finds me. How could you keep this from me?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We weren’t keeping anything from you, Agatha, we needed to make sure. I was planning on telling you the minute we found out…” Alice said in their defense.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood frozen, her arms were wrapped around herself. Rio saw the hurt and fear spreading through her and stood up. As she moved, Agatha took a step back. “Please…” Agatha whispered. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stopped, dropping her head. She needed to come clean, to let Agatha know that she could be trusted. “Okay Agatha,” Rio sighed, “I thought I saw someone taking a photo of us in Eastview, I wasn’t really sure, then we all found out about RB and I asked Alice to just look around town, to see if anyone seemed out of place.” Rio looked at Alice, who shrugged. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just tell her.” Alice said defeated.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Dottie has been getting payments from Lilia, she’s the one who’s been keeping surveillance on you, but I don’t think it means what you think, Lilia has used her to make sure you are still safe. That’s all… for now.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha seemed to relax a bit, still standing far enough from Rio. “For now?” Agatha asked, narrowing her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Jen shared a look at each other. “Jen and I went to Lilia’s office to ask her for help, I think she doesn’t trust me. But Wanda saw us there, and she sort of thinks that Jen and I are… dating.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha looked at Rio, then at Jen, then back at Rio, and started a low laugh. As her laugh got louder and more frantic, Rio and the others looked at each other confused. Finally Agatha was curled up laughing like a maniac. Rio saw her erratic laughing turn into something else, and before she could get closer, Agatha sunk to the floor and burst out in tears. In an instant, Rio was by her side.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This is a fucking circus!” Agatha cried. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags,” Alice said, approaching her carefully, “You have to know that we’re doing everything we can to get to the bottom of this. As crazy as this all feels now, we’re on top of it. And no one is getting to you or Nicky, not while we’re here to protect you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up and Rio felt the tension in her muscles ease as Agatha allowed her to get close enough again to comfort her. “Ags, we all love you, so much.” Rio squeezed her eyes shut. Shit, she’ll deal with that revelation later. “You can trust us. Alice has someone looking into Lilia to see what she’s up to, and whatever else comes from that, we’ll deal with it, okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha simply stared at Rio and Rio could feel the pressure of the whole evening bubbling up and threatening to burst out of Agatha. She cupped her face and rested her forehead against Agatha’s. “Trust us, trust me, please.” she pleaded in a whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After what felt like hours, Agatha stopped crying and stood up. Agatha felt the weight of the evening pressing down on her chest, the only thing grounding her now, was Rio holding on to her. Rio helped her to the sofa and let her sit down. Jen brought everyone drinks from the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio handed Agatha a glass of whisky, which she threw back down her throat as soon as she held it in her hands, and handed the glass back to Rio. “Another.” Agatha said. If they were going to get through tonight, they would need some reinforcements.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Jen handed Rio the bottle and she refilled Agatha’s glass.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment everyone sat in silence. Agatha sighed loudly, “Well how fucked am I exactly?” Agatha finally asked. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio told you most of it. I have a guy digging to find Evanora and to see what her moves and connections are. I think we can trust Lilia, I will try to find her, Westview is small and she won’t have a lot of places to hide in, and if you want, I will see what I can find about Mel. If she and Lilia are meeting, there must be a reason. I don’t think we should show all our cards just yet, so I will do it discreetly.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, but please, Al. I need to know.” Agatha said. “This is my life, and Nicky’s. If Mel is… bad, I don’t want Nicky there with her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll see what I can find, Ags.” Alice said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And I guess I’ll break up with Rio.” Jen said, sighing. Everyone burst out laughing, finally easing some of the tension in the room.</span>

<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It was almost 3am when Alice and Jen finally left to go home. After the intense evening after the play and everything that followed, everyone was exhausted and ready for the day to finally be over.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was lying curled up in bed next to Rio. She was laying dead still, and it unnerved Rio. Rio hated seeing her like this, and she hated that she was part of the reason for Agatha to feel this way.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha didn’t say much after Alice and Jen left. She simply walked to her bedroom and climbed into bed. Rio followed behind her, nervous and uncertain. “Get in.” Agatha said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio replayed the whole evening in her head, she felt the guilt festering in her chest, they should have never kept this from her. Agatha was right to be upset, this was her life, and they had no right to keep this from her, even if it was to protect her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry,” Rio whispered in the dark. She was laying on her back staring up into the darkness of the bedroom with Agatha turned away from her, still close enough for her to feel her warmth. “I should have told you the minute we left Eastview that night.” Rio admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha remained quiet while Rio’s head spun, “Agatha I…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You said </span>
<em>
<span>We.</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha interrupted her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Huh?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Earlier. You said </span>
<em>
<span>we </span>
</em>
<span>all love you.” Agatha said quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio paused. She did. She said that, and honestly, it felt true. “I did.” Rio said plainly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt Agatha turn over in the bed to face her. Even with the lights turned off, she could feel Agatha’s piercing blue eyes on her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I said it because I know it is true. Alice loves you, Jen does too… and me.” Rio admitted carefully.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You?” Agatha asked slowly. “You too?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a breath and reached out to Agatha, her hand resting on her chest. “Me too.” she answered with a soft voice.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt Agatha’s lips crashing on hers suddenly. Agatha was pulling her closer and she rolled over on top of Rio, kissing her passionately. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags,” Rio said between kisses. Agatha’s lips were hot and messy as they moved down her jaw to her neck. Rio felt her whole body erupting in goosebumps. “Agatha...”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Shut up.” Agatha hissed as she kissed Rio’s lips hard. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s whole body protested but she managed to push Agatha up. “Agatha, wait.” Rio said, breathlessly. Agatha sat up on Rio’s hips. “Just… are you sure you’re okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stilled for a moment. Rio’s heart stopped. “Rio, I feel like everything around me is falling apart… I just need you to keep me from falling apart too. Please.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s quiet admission jolted Rio’s heart back to life. She nodded, “I’m not letting you fall apart, my love.” Rio slowly pulled Agatha back down towards her and wrapped her arms around her back, letting Agatha’s head rest on her chest. “I’m never letting you fall.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved to kiss Rio again, this time slower, but firm. Rio held onto Agatha, allowing her to take what she needed from her. Agatha lifted herself and removed her clothes, pulling at Rio’s shirt. Rio cupped her face and kissed her gently, letting her tongue swipe over Agatha’s. She felt Agatha’s hand drift to her chest, cupping her breast and Rio sighed into her mouth as Agatha gently kneaded them. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lips trailed over Rio’s throat, kissing her and nipping at the sensitive skin just below her jaw. Rio lifted her hips and hurriedly removed the last of her clothes. Agatha’s thigh pushed between hers and she moved her hips in sequence to Agatha’s, already feeling her warm arousal spreading over her thigh.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A hand moved in between them, cupping Rio’s wet center and Rio let out a gasp. Rio could feel Agatha’s fingers move over her and she bucked her hips up in response. Agatha’s mouth moved down her neck to her chest and felt her hot lips wrap around a hard nipple, sucking gently. Rio’s hand flung to grab at Agatha’s neck, pulling her closer as Agatha’s fingers entered her, pumping into her slowly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her breath hitched as Agatha’s thumb dragged over her clit, circling it perfectly. Agatha kept pumping in and out of her at an agonizingly slow pace, her mouth never leaving her already sensitive nipple. Rio moaned Agatha’s name like a prayer as she felt her orgasm build and finally rip through her body. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As she writhed below Agatha’s warm body, she felt her move even lower and suddenly Agatha’s mouth was on her, pulling her clit between her lips. Rio swore she saw stars. Agatha continued to move her fingers in and out of Rio, finally adding another digit, stretching her even further. The sensation of Agatha’s mouth and her fingers sent her over the edge once more and her breathing and moans became frantic as she erupted in pleasure once again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha moved back up, trailing wet warm kisses up her body, leaving a map of marks as she moved up to pull Rio in for a deep passionate kiss. Rio pulled her bottom lip between hers and grabbed at Agatha’s hips, grinding her against Rio’s thigh. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio flipped them over slowly, keeping her thigh pressed up to Agatha. Her hot breath mixed with Agatha’s as the pace of their hips moving together picked up again. Rio felt everything so intense, every move of muscle against her skin, every nail scraping her back. She was in heaven.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha whispered, almost pleading.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you need, my love?” Rio breathed back against her neck, their hips still moving and grinding together.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Bottom drawer,” Agatha moaned between kisses. “It’s… oh fuck… in the box under the books…” Agatha managed to get out, pointing at the dresser.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze and realized what Agatha was alluding at. Excitedly, she jumped off the bed and pulled the drawer open, almost ripping the handle off. Under the books she saw a black box and opened it, already knowing what’s inside. She lifted the lid and took out the leather harness and the purple dildo. A thrill of excitement passed through her body down to her core.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me just clean it, don’t move.” She said leaning in for a quick kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Promise I won’t.” Agatha smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Once she dried it off she almost ran back to the bedroom, but the realization of what waited suddenly hit her. For a moment she stood frozen with the items in her hand. Then, without overthinking it, she slipped the harness in place and popped the dildo through the loop in the front. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She felt the base rub exactly where it should as she adjusted the straps and buckles on the sides. Her head lifted and she saw Agatha staring up at her, the moonlight piercing through the split in the curtains illuminating her face enough for her to see her hungered expression.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked over back to the bed and Agatha pulled her down as soon as she was close enough to reach. Agatha pulled at her neck as she kissed her, hungry, passionately, consumingly. Rio felt the base of the dildo grind against her as she moved in between Agatha’s thighs, that feeling alone almost set her ablaze. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio, please…” Agatha moaned into her mouth as the tip teased her with every move of their bodies. “I need you inside me… now…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio reached between them and felt Agatha’s Core almost dripping with want. “Fuck…” she moaned and moved the tip to Agatha’s entrance. Agatha spread her legs wider in anticipation and the moment Rio moved into her, Agatha let out a guttural moan rendering Rio feral as she drove it in deeper, bottoming out against Agatha’s hips. She stayed there a second, not moving, allowing Agatha to adjust to the feeling of being filled. “Is this okay?” she asked carefully, grinding her hips slowly against her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, god, please don’t go slow.” Agatha hissed as she grabbed at Rio’s back. Rio lifted one of Agatha’s thighs and adjusted herself before she started pumping into Agatha. Each time their hips met, Rio felt a jolt move through her core, encouraging her to move faster. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s leg curled over her back and locked with her other leg and Rio felt herself being able to pump in deeper. She wished she could feel Agatha clench around her, but the grind of the base and the loud moaning from below her sent her into a trance. She could feel her own climax starting to build up again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed at her hips as she bucked them up into her with every thrust and soon after she felt her body go stiff below her as Agatha fell over the edge in ecstasy. Agatha pushed Rio off her and Rio obliged willingly as Agatha climbed over her and positioned the tip to enter her once again, riding Rio’s cock. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck…you’re perfect.” Rio whispered as she held onto Agatha’s hips. She wished she could see her face in the darkness, but as one sensation was taken away the others were enhanced. She felt and heard every little moan, every grunt, every wet sound coming from between them. As if on instinct her hands lifted to Agatha’s breasts, she pinched the pebbled nipples between her fingers as she squeezed, earning her another yelp from the beautiful creature above her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bent down and kissed Rio firmly, never stopping her hips from moving and the adjusted angle ground the base of the dildo even further into Rio’s core. “Come with me,” Agatha said against her mouth and in a chorus of moans they both burst. As if on cue, she let go and felt Agatha‘s orgasm squirt all over her hips and gasped at the sudden wetness dripping over her.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Their movements slowed down, and she held onto Agatha as she laid still on her chest, finally able to catch her breath. “Shit, I’m sorry… I have never…” Agatha said breathlessly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a breath, not believing what had just happened. This perfect woman who she now knew she was in love with, obsessed with, actually apologizing for that? For giving her that gift? “Please Agatha, never apologize, that was the hottest fucking thing I have ever experienced in my life.” Rio said, unbelievably. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I will need a few minutes to recover, but we are definitely doing that again.” Agatha laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled off of her, spent and satisfied. Rio intertwined their hands and kissed Agatha’s fingers, “I don’t think I’ll ever want anything or anyone else… I am forever ruined for anyone else.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Good,” Agatha laughed, breathlessly. “Because I don’t want to know the person I would become if you weren’t.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled Agatha close and let her curl into her side, she pulled the covers over them as the cool air settled over their warm bodies. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After another few quiet minutes in each other’s arms, Agatha asked quietly, “So… Do you want to talk about it.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment Rio was unsure what Agatha meant. “About?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The </span>
<em>
<span>we </span>
</em>
<span>of it all.” she answered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ah… the </span>
<em>
<span>we </span>
</em>
<span>of it all.” Rio repeated.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Did you mean it?” Agatha asked. Rio knew it was way too early and maybe it was the circumstances, maybe it was lust, maybe it was finally feeling at home, or maybe it was something else. But maybe it </span>
<em>
<span>was </span>
</em>
<span>love.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I… I think I did.” She answered quietly. “Sorry, I know it’s probably crazy…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It is crazy.” Agatha said. Rio cringed. She fucked this up already, she thought. It was too fast. Too much. Rio wanted to pull her foot out of her mouth… Two weeks of having her back in her life and she blurted out that she loved her like a fucking lunatic…</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please ignore me…if it’s too much.”  Rio backpedaled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled her head up away from Rio. “No, what I mean is it </span>
<em>
<span>is </span>
</em>
<span>entirely crazy, but it’s real, for me too. I feel it too.” Agatha admitted. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You do?” Rio asked carefully.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah. Maybe we’re just two crazy people in love.” Agatha laughed quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cupped her face and kissed her slowly. “I’ve never felt this… strongly about anyone, Agatha. You… this feels real, this feels…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Inevitable.” Agatha said calmly, unwaveringly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah… inevitable.” Rio repeated.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria waited for Agatha in her class. Agatha startled when she saw her sitting on the edge of her desk. She wasn’t in the mood, but after the fall out last night, she should have expected her to be there. Maria was never one to leave things unsaid. When their marriage was starting to fall apart, Maria was the one who kept them talking. If it weren’t for that, they wouldn’t have stayed friends through all of it, and Nicky’s life would have been way more complicated.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s body felt heavy. Despite floating on a cloud from her night with Rio she was exhausted. They probably only had three hours of sleep and Agatha could feel it in every bone in her body. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Maria.” She greeted. Maria had her arms crossed over her chest, a tell tale sign that she was pissed off. Agatha remembers this stance from before when she would sneak back into their house late at night after drowning her sorrows at Tony’s. The ghosts of her past usually got her around the anniversary of the trial.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, we need to talk. Last night was…” Maria shook her head in disbelief. “ Ags, what is going on with you? I’ve seen you spiral before, but last night was just insane. Accusing Mel like that…” Maria said angrily.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed and closed the classroom door. She knew this might turn heated, like it had right before their inevitable divorce. The whole school heard them fight and principal Rogers had to intervene. “Maria, I probably went too far last night, I know, but I know what I saw. Melinda is lying to me and I don’t know why.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Why would she, Agatha? What on earth would she even gain from that? You are being paranoid and I can’t fucking understand why.” Maria looked furious. Agatha understood her confusion. She wouldn’t know, Agatha has never even alluded to a past other than the picture perfect story she had memorized before she moved to Westview. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I just… know, okay.” Agatha barked out. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, who did you see her talking to?” Maria asked. Agatha’s eyes popped open. “Who was the </span>
<em>
<span>woman</span>
</em>
<span> you saw?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s… I…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, you can’t even tell me, can you?” Maria said, exasperated. “You know, this is fucking typical Agatha. Every time… you fucking shut down, close yourself off. No one can talk to you like this. But you know what? Maybe </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> are the one lying to yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You wouldn’t understand, Maria. This goes so much deeper than what you think, okay.” Agatha said, the frustration boiling up in her tear ducts.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well what I think is that you haven’t changed a bit. You were always hiding something from me and your friends. No one was ever good enough to get close to you, to really know you. Do you have any fucking idea how that feels, to love someone without them allowing you to really know them. You made me feel like a fucking stranger in our own home, Agatha, and now that we’ve both moved on, you are starting this all over again. Are you going to do the same to Rio? To Nicky?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha winced at the accusation. The hurt she’s caused her, the truth in Maria’s words, of course she was right… she was the one always hiding, always lying, but she had a fucking good reason for it. She had to keep herself safe and when Nicky came she had to be extra careful.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ladies!” the classroom door swung open. Sharon  stepped in the room, her shrill voice echoing in the silence between their sudden silent argument. “</span>
<em>
<span>What</span>
</em>
<span> is going on here?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes, of course Sharon would ignore the closed door and barge in. Privacy has always been an illusion for that woman.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s fine Sharon. I was just leaving.” Agatha hissed. “I think I need to go home. I have a headache and my classes for the day are done anyway.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha picked up her things from her desk and brushed past Maria as she stormed out. “Agatha!” Maria called after her. “We’re not done.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stopped at the door, “Tell Nicky I’ll pick him up tomorrow.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat at Agatha’s dining room table staring at her laptop, willing herself to get some work done, but her head was filled with Agatha, only taking a break from her dreamy smile to drift back to the events of the night after the play. How had the night turned from batshit crazy at Maria’s house and then to fucking amazing in Agatha’s bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her muscles still felt the delicious burn from her night with Agatha. The ache in her hips reminded her of the moments they came apart so beautifully in each other’s arms. Her heart still fluttered at the memory of Agatha’s voice calling her name. She’d never sleep again in her life if it meant she could have more of Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A sudden sadness fell over her when she received an email from her boss, she was needed back in Philadelphia on Monday. That meant she only had a few more days to spend with Agatha before she had to return back to reality, back to her job and responsibilities. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They haven’t yet discussed what their future would look like after their confessions early that morning. In reality, Agatha’s life was here in Westview with her son, and hers in Philadelphia. Expecting Agatha to move back was out of the question, they uprooted her whole life away from Philadelphia and to return will be too dangerous. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>From what she’s seen here in Westview, her career as a Landscape Architect wasn’t really a realistic option, she’d be an over qualified gardener at best, but it was the 21st Century and post Covid, working remotely wasn’t just an option, many people were able to have successful careers continents and countries away from their company’s headquarters. She’ll figure it out when the time comes, but for now, she will make time, she thought. As much as she could, to be with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio continued with her work, updating drawings and reviewing contracts with her suppliers and clients. She was in the middle of typing another email to her client when she suddenly heard a knock at the door. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She walked over to the front door and peeped through the window next to the door. She couldn’t see anyone, but opened the door anyway. She looked around to see if she saw the person who knocked, but nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As she stepped out of the house to look down the street, she kicked a small package left in front of the door. Agatha probably ordered something to be delivered to the house, so she picked it up and took it inside.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took the box in and set it down on the table before sitting back down behind her laptop. She continued typing the email again, but something about the box started to bother her. She glanced over to the box every now and then and frowned. It could be anything, but now that she thought about it, the package had no labels, stickers or logos. Strange.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Finally, curiosity got the best of her. She had to open it. Something felt wrong and she felt sure that whatever was in that box wasn’t a pair of shoes. She lifted the lid carefully. It looked like junk, scrapped paper, crumpled up, nothing else. She opened up one of the balls of crumpled up papers and what she saw made her blood run cold. It was a copy of Agatha’s Witness Protection papers. Every detail of the transfer. Her new name, her age, her new location. They had her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck.</span>

<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stormed out to her car in the teacher’s parking lot. Maria’s confrontation in her classroom was the final straw. She had to know if she saw Lilia last night, if she was going to ruin her relationship with Nicky’s mother, she had to know if she was wrong.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She decided to call Alice. If anyone could find Lilia in Westview it was her. Her post as Officer Wu was merely a title for show, in fact far below her, but to keep up with the image of small town cop and friend of the history teacher she had to blend in, </span>
<em>
<span>Special Agent Wu</span>
</em>
<span> would have stood out like a sore thumb.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice picked up on the first ring. </span>
<em>
<span>“Agatha,” </span>
</em>
<span>Alice answered surprised.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I need to know if I am going insane. Please tell me you found her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I uh… was just about to call you actually. You need to come home now. I’m here already, Rio called me.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice… what happened?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Everyone is okay, but you need to come home now.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raced home. Usually when someone started with </span>
<em>
<span>everyone is okay</span>
</em>
<span> that didn’t necessarily mean that everyone was okay. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her wheels shrieked as she turned into her driveway. She turned off the car in a furious hurry and ran inside.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio! Nicky!” She yelled once she was through the door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio said as Agatha ran into her arms. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Are you okay? Is Nicky here?” Agatha asked frantically.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky is with Maria, but, yes I’m fine. Nothing happened to anyone.” Rio said, cupping her face. Rio held her like that for a moment and Agatha felt the relief run through her body. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That package came today.” Rio said softly, glancing back at the box on the table. Agatha saw Alice hanging over the box, inspecting each and every corner of it with the crumpled up papers all opened up and spread out on the table next to it.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at them, immediately recognizing it. “Who? How?” She stuttered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s what we’re trying to figure out. Agatha, but while we do that, we need to get you and Nicky to a safer place. I need to get these to the station to see if we can trace it back to someone.” Alice said in her Special Agent voice.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No! Fuck this. Fuck </span>
<em>
<span>all </span>
</em>
<span>of this. I am done. If that fucker wants to come for me I’ll kill him.” Agatha yelled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Rio froze. “Agatha, be real. We can’t risk your or Nicky’s safety.” Alice said firmly, “Look, I know you think we can handle this, but we have no idea what that man is capable of. Please, let me get you and Nicky somewhere safe, at least for a few days till we have a way forward. They know where you live now and who knows if they know about Nicky?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“God, this is a nightmare.” Agatha cried.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s not on your papers, thank god, but we can’t risk them finding out about him, he’ll want to get his hands on your son just to get to you.” Alice stated.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slumped back onto the dining chair. Alice was right. If someone wanted her to jump off a cliff to keep Nicky safe she’d do it in a second. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you have any idea who left it on the doorstep, Rio?” Agatha asked. “Did you see?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I looked but I didn’t see anything or anyone. I’m sorry baby.” Rio said disappointed. Rio held onto Agatha’s hand. She squeezed it lightly. Agatha smiled back at her, “It’s okay.” she whispered quietly, “This isn’t your fault.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The somber atmosphere in the dining room felt heavy. There had to be something that led them to her, Agatha thought. Maybe she was getting too comfortable, too visible. But how far did this have to go, she changed her name, her address, everything, she even dyed her hair. “How did they even find me?” Agatha asked concerned.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice thought for a while. “Oh, Dottie! We know she’s been spying on you, and she’s probably got this whole place under surveillance, maybe she saw something.” Alice said excitedly. “Let me go to her…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re coming with you.” Agatha interrupted, standing up abruptly. “This time I am not watching from the sidelines.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could see Alice wasn’t comfortable with her suggestion. “Okay fine, let’s go then.” Alice shrugged. “I guess it’s better than leaving you alone here.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The three marched across the street to Dottie’s house and Agatha knocked on the door, no banged on the door. “What?” She asked Alice, who looked at her like she was a crazy person. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The door opened. “Agatha, Officer Wu and Rio, is it?” Dottie said almost believably surprised.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Cut the crap Dottie, I know about you and your fucking little cameras.” Agatha said curtly as she pushed her aside and walked into her home. “And call Lilia won’t you, I know she’s in town.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie followed behind her. “Agatha, I don’t know who you are talking about…” Dottie stuttered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen 007, we know about your little spy mission okay, so either you are calling her or I will, after I kick your pretty face in.” Agatha snarled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, okay. Oh, Agatha, I’ve never seen this side…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Did I fucking stutter Dottie? Call. Her. Now.” Agatha yelled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, Rio and Alice sat in Dottie’s over-decorated living room. There were way too many throw pillows, trinkets and lamps. It looked like an interior decorator from the 60’s threw up in there. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie was in the next room calling Lilia. Agatha would get the answers she needed come hell or high water and if it meant murdering Dottie tonight she’ll gladly carry the consequences.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie walked back into her living room and sat down on the armrest of the sofa opposite Agatha. “She’s on her way.” Dottie sighed. “There goes my new trip to Paris… you know I was saving up to finally see the Eiffel Tower, but now that my jig is up, I guess it’ll have to wait.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes. Even with her whole housewife/spy act being blown apart, the woman was still infuriatingly annoying. “So what is it you actually </span>
<em>
<span>do</span>
</em>
<span> for Lilia?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie looked way too excited as she answered, “Well, I sort of watch out for you. The usual covert stuff, checking out your friends and those around you, then I send my reports to Lilia and I get a nice monthly paycheck to buy pretty things with. Last month I bought these.” Dottie said grinning and pointing at a set of three porcelain bulldogs all posed in different ways. It was so stupid and Agatha almost felt sorry for the woman.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So you spy on me, and invade the privacy of everyone in my life so you can buy fucking porcelain bulldogs?” Agatha snarled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie gasped, “No, not only bulldogs, I have a yacht too.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha raised her eyebrows in surprise, “What do you need a yacht for in Westview? Is there a hidden beach around here we don’t know about?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It was an impulse buy okay.” Dottie said, shrugging her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just in time to spare them from more of Dottie’s awkward show and tell of useless things, the door opened and in walked Lilia.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gasped and froze in place when she saw Lilia walk in. Her hair was all grey now, she looked older but still fiercely powerful but still just as warm as she remembered her godmother to be. “It </span>
<em>
<span>was</span>
</em>
<span> you.” Agatha whispered with teary eyes as she got up and walked straight into Lilia’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Aggie, my dear,” Lilia said, wrapping her arms around her in a warm hug.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The room around them felt like it was holding its breath. Agatha could smell the familiar scent of jasmine, her signature perfume. Lilia wasn’t her real mother but she was more than a mother than she ever really had in Evanora. Awkwardly she pulled away from her, wiping a small tear from her eye.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I knew it was you. I knew the minute I saw you at school yesterday.” Agatha said to her quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I seem to have lost my touch at moving in the shadows. I’m usually more… subtle.” Lilia said, taking a seat on one of the sofas.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a seat next to Rio. Rio took her hand and kissed her knuckles. With everything happening she was glad for the reminder that Rio was there too. Agatha smiled up at her, Rio’s warm brown eyes flickering back up at her, saying </span>
<em>
<span>It’ll be okay.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>This was a lot to take in. Agatha suddenly found it hard to reconcile everything that happened over the last two days with the happiness she felt with seeing Lilia and with Rio being in her life. It was quite the juxtaposition.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, now that the cat is out of the bag…” Alice interrupted. “Can someone please explain what is going on?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes well, I suppose I owe you an explanation.” Lilia started. “Aggie, remember how I said I would take care of you?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded quietly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That is exactly what I have been doing. I’ve been… observing from afar, checking in on you personally here in Westview, occasionally. Dottie has been my eyes and ears for the past ten years. You do understand why I couldn’t make contact with you Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I wish you had told me Lilia. I have missed you, and I really… I was alone for so long here.” Agatha could feel the tears starting to well up. “I lost so much moving here…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“But look at what you made for yourself, Aggie. I am so proud. You have a real family here. You are safe, and loved and…” Lilia reminded her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Not for long…” Agatha interrupted Lilia.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean?” Lilia asked, moving closer to the edge of the seat.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“He sent a package today. Ralph.” Alice said. “That’s actually why we are here. Dottie, you are the </span>
<em>
<span>eyes and ears</span>
</em>
<span> here, any chance you have surveillance cameras around Agatha’s house?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie laughed, “No…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, Rio and Alice all stared at her in disbelief.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay fine,” Dottie admitted, “But I promise Agatha, it was only to make sure no unwanted guests came around.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“How many cameras do you have set up around my house, Dottie?” Agatha asked, standing up, suddenly realizing that her last few weeks of visits with Rio hadn’t been very… PG.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie’s eyes widened and she stood up, walking backwards slowly, putting extra distance between her and Agatha. “Let me see, front door, back door, kitchen…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Kitchen? You have cameras inside?” Rio asked almost too loudly. Agatha turned to her and saw her face almost as red as she felt her own cheeks turning a shade darker.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t worry, Ags, nothing overlooking the bedrooms,” Dottie winked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice giggled and Agatha could kill her for it.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed in frustration and rolled her eyes. “Okay fine, whatever. Can you check if you can see who dropped the package this afternoon?” Agatha asked, finally getting down to the point.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie hopped around in one quick jump and pulled open a hidden door revealing a set up of four screens with a wall filled with photos and pictures and other tech things Agatha had no intention of understanding. How the ditz Dottie understood or knew to use any of it was a mystery on its own.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What the fuck,” Alice gasped with her eyes opened bigger than Agatha had ever seen them. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh this old thing?” Dottie laughed. “I’m ex FBI actually. Well I wasn’t a field agent, but I still got to use the fun stuff.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well fuck me then.” Alice scoffed, amazed, “Who knew.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Dottie clicked a few buttons and pulled up a video on the screen. “Here it is.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They walked up behind Dottie and leaned in closer to see the video on her screens. Someone dressed in an unfamiliar delivery company uniform walked up to the front door and put down the box, took a picture of it in front of the door, knocked and quickly walked away. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well that helped no one… we can't even see the person’s face!” Agatha cried out. “We can’t see where they came from, where they went…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, Ags, we have something okay, this isn’t nothing.” Alice said, holding her shoulders. “There should be a way to enhance some of it. The flash of the camera may have lit up their face a bit, maybe I can get a face off the reflection on the window.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha considered everything for a second. She felt totally overwhelmed, scared, happy to see Lilia, fuck she was an emotional mess. “Okay, please Alice. This is too close to us now.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Like I said Ags, we need to take you and Nicky to a safe house. We can’t risk it.” Alice said. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay… but what do I tell Maria? I can’t just take Nicky and disappear for a few days. I can’t leave him here.” Agatha panicked, it would be easy for herself to hide away but what about her son? What would she tell him, or his mother?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That makes things a bit more complicated, especially since we’ve now got our own doubts about Mel.” Alice said, calculating. “Until we find out how she fits into all of this, we can’t trust her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia,” Agatha asked, “Last night, at the school, you were talking to a woman, Melinda May. That’s when I saw you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia turned to walk back to the sofa and took a seat. Agatha came to sit down next to her. The others remained standing around, observing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You can trust her.” Lilia said, holding onto Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We cleared her years ago, Agatha. Right after she and Maria got together.” Dottie chimed in from behind her mission control set up. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt lighter in an instant. Then she felt the embarrassment of guilt wave over her. “Fuck, I definitely owe Mel an apology now.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What for?” Lilia asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned to face Lilia again, “I sort of yelled at her in her face, accusing her of some conspiracy, that she knew you and was lying to me about it.” Agatha let her head fall in her hands, laughing at herself, “Maria’s going to love this.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay so Ags, let’s figure out what we need to tell Maria to get you and Nicky in a safer place if only till the end of the week. Just until we get to the bottom of whoever left that package and where it came from.” Alice suggested.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at her hands, fidgeting with her bracelet. “I can’t do this again. I can’t disappear again. There must be something else we can do.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched Alice consider her for a moment. “Dottie, I’ll need access to your cameras, I guess I can get more bodies patrolling the area, station someone near the school and at Maria’s to keep an eye on them…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the familiar haze float over her as she listened to her life being planned to keep Ralph away from her again. She zoned out after Alice mentioned Nicky. Her innocent son, now possibly put in danger by his own mother. She felt her chest tightening.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I need some air.” Agatha said, standing up abruptly. Without thinking she grabbed Rio’s arm on the way out onto Dottie’s back porch and walked until she stopped at the far end of the garden.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Rio said softly placing her hands on her shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could cry, scream, punch something, but nothing would work. Nothing would lessen the anger she felt, the hatred for a dangerous drug lord and the mother she naively thought she could trust.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, baby, breathe please.” Rio said, pulling her closer. Agatha let Rio hold her, her arms felt like the only solid thing in her life at the moment. Strong, warm, grounding.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I just want this to be over.” Agatha cried softly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know. I know, baby.” Rio kissed the top of Agatha’s head as Agatha cradled herself in Rio’s arms, resting her head on Rio’s shoulder. “It’s going to be hard but we’ll get through this, okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled away from Rio just slightly, not wanting to be let go yet. She looked into her warm brown eyes and believed her, or at least she really wanted to. “Okay.” Agatha kissed Rio slowly, her warm kiss sending shivers down her cold body in the November afternoon air.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just then Alice called from the porch. “You okay to go back in?” Rio asked quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded and took Rio’s hand in hers as they walked back into Dottie’s house. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We have something. Dottie forgot to mention the camera inside that scary garden gnome you have sitting in the driveway,” Alice said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck Dottie, I had that gnome inside my kitchen for years before I moved it outside.” Agatha cringed, the amount of times she walked around in the kitchen on days she was alone, barely dressed … “We need to know where else they are around the house.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha …”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Dottie, I swear to god…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine, fine. First you take Paris from me and now you take my Saturday night entertainment too.” Dottie sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha could kill the nosy bitch.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, well let’s get back to the point. We’ll deal with </span>
<em>
<span>Big Brother</span>
</em>
<span> later. Dottie pull up the picture again please.” Alice asked. “Agatha, do you know this guy?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squinted at the slightly blurred photo on the screen, straining her eyes to see if she could make out who the person under the baseball cap was. Definitely a man, although the beard looked fake, she thought. She looked at his eyes, trying her best to recognize something in his face. Then it hit her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Isn’t that… Dennis?” Agatha asked Dottie.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The mail man?” Dottie asked, confused. “That’s a bit on the nose. But Dennis is… Dennis. When I did a background check on him it came back clean. Plus he really doesn't have the smarts to be a part of this.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Someone probably paid him to deliver the package. I’ll find him, confront him, we’ll get something out of him.” Alice said confidently. “For now, Agatha, you need to get out of here, even if it is only for tonight.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I can get us a room somewhere out of town, but close?” Rio suggested. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I have a safe house outside of Eastview. I own it. It's about an hour’s drive from here, plenty of room for you and Nicky.” Lilia suggested.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Then it is settled.” Alice said. “Agatha, you’ll need to pack for at least till the end of the weekend. Tell Maria you and Nicky are coming with me for a break out of town or something, to clear your head after the whole Mel story? We’ll pick him up in an hour. Lilia, I’ll need the location of that safe house. Okay…” Alice paced, going through an invisible list in her head. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha has never seen her friend like this. She was impressed. Her friend suddenly changed into Special Agent Wu right in front of her eyes. “Okay Agatha, we’ll need to move, soon.” Alice said. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took Rio’s hand, “You’ll come with?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her, “Always.”</span>

<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat next to Nicky in Alice’s SUV. She held his hand as he slept soundly against her side as they followed the GPS coordinates to Lilia’s safe house. Rio, who agreed without even blinking, to come along to the safe house, sat in the front seat next to Alice, the two of them quietly chatting away about something Agatha lost interest in 20 minutes into their trip. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s thoughts were too preoccupied. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Getting Maria to agree to take Nicky out of school for a day, and out of town for the weekend proved to be much more of a discussion than Agatha planned for, but after apologizing to Melinda and spinning something about being overwhelmed with the play and everything else, Maria finally gave in and agreed, as long as she stuck to the custody arrangement of having him back at home by Sunday night.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha had no other choice than to agree, hopefully they could leave Lilia’s safe house at the end of the weekend. If not, she’ll have to make up something else. For now at least, it was enough to convince Maria. Nicky was obviously excited, he could miss a day of school, any child’s dream, and he got to go away to a secret location with his new favorite person, Rio. Well what he didn’t know yet, was that Rio was quickly becoming his mother’s favorite person too. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio glanced back at Agatha and Nicky. “You are very quiet, everything okay?” she whispered as she looked at Nicky sleeping against Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I think so.” Agatha whispered back. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’re 15 minutes away.” Alice said quickly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha suddenly felt nervous, or excited, she couldn't decide. Nicky would be meeting Lilia for the first time. Not that Lilia hasn’t seen photos of him already, but Nicky would be meeting the person she wished was her real mother. If she could she would keep him away from Evanora till the day that evil woman finally left the earth in whatever blaze of horrid fire awaited her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice turned off the main road and followed a hidden dirt road through the trees up to a set of tall gates. She pressed the buzzer and the gates opened. Agatha’s mouth fell open as she took in the estate before her. This wasn’t a safe </span>
<em>
<span>house</span>
</em>
<span>, it was a safe </span>
<em>
<span>mansion</span>
</em>
<span> she thought. She saw wide stretches of grass as far as she could see and perfectly manicured gardens led up to the front door of the Georgian style mansion.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit, Agatha, look at this place.” Alice said, amazed. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, Lilia is like </span>
<em>
<span>rich </span>
</em>
<span>rich…” Rio chimed in.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As Alice stopped the car in front of the main entrance door, two men dressed in suits greeted them to collect their bags. Lilia strode out of the door to greet them. “Welcome to The Barn.” Lilia said casually, opening her arms to greet them.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Barn?” the three women said in unison.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia, this is far from a barn.” Agatha said, blinking up at the mansion.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s only called </span>
<em>
<span>Barn</span>
</em>
<span> because it belonged to my uncle Barny.” Lilia said flippantly. “But enough about that old fart, let me greet my baby.” Lilia said brushing past Agatha to Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky wiped the sleep out of his eyes and stared up at the older woman who came towards him with open arms. “Nicolas!” Lilia said, pulling him into loving hug. “You’re so tall!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky, this is Lilia.” Agatha said, smiling softly at her son.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia let go of Nicky. “I’m your mom’s godmother.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looked up at Agatha and then back at Lilia. “So like my grandma, but in the mafia?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Both women laughed, “I guess you could say that.” Agatha said, still laughing “We’re visiting her here for the weekend.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Come inside, I’ll show you around and to where your rooms are. Nicky, if you want you can go with Gerald, our stable hand, to see the horses?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky jumped in excitement, “Mom, can I pleeease?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up at Lilia, she nodded, answering in silence that it was safe. “Sure baby.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah!” Nicky yelled, running after Gerald.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha, Alice and Rio followed Lilia inside the mansion. Agatha couldn’t believe her eyes as she took in the lavish decor and furniture, it looked like a castle, something out of a movie. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Your rooms are upstairs, there’s a suite in the west wing. It’s got adjoining rooms for you and Nicky. I’m assuming you and Rio would be sharing.” Lilia said with a grin.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck, they still haven’t talked to Nicky. Agatha smiled nervously at Rio, “We ah…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh Agatha, this isn’t a convent.” Lilia laughed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We don’t have to.” Rio said to Agatha quietly, squeezing Agatha’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“There’s a room across from the suite, should you need it.” Lilia said, quickly picking up and understanding the situation. Lilia always had a knack for reading people.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you.” Agatha smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, Ags. I’ve scoped out the place and we have uniforms at the property entrance and around the house. You should be safe here.” Alice said, holding onto her arm.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you Al.” Agatha smiled, hugging her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m heading back into town. We’ve tracked down Dennis. I’ll check in with you a bit later, yeah?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice hugged her again and darted out of the front door. Agatha waved slowly as Alice’s SUV sped down the driveway. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll be okay.” Rio whispered, taking her hand. “I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*********</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After dinner Lilia retreated to her room. Agatha went with Nicky to settle him in for the night, the kid was understandably scared to sleep in a strange room, and Rio couldn’t really blame him. Rio has never been in a house this big. It reminded her of the haunted house she took Agatha to on their date, only this time their host was a kooky old lady instead of a soulless teenager. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Reluctantly, Rio found her baggage in the room opposite the suite where Agatha and Nicky were staying. Of course she respected their current dynamic, and if Agatha wasn’t ready to tell Nicky yet, she would be fine with that, but she couldn’t help feeling a little disappointed at having to spend the night away from her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio also needed to vent to someone. Throughout all of this, she tried to be strong, supportive, but it was starting to get to her too. She knew she could talk to Agatha, but how could she tell the woman she promised to protect and be brave for, that </span>
<em>
<span>she </span>
</em>
<span>herself was terrified. Agatha didn’t need to worry about her too. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sat on the edge of the bed and scrolled through her phone’s contacts. Her thumb hovered over Natasha’s number. Of course she couldn’t tell her </span>
<em>
<span>everything, </span>
</em>
<span>but checking in and catching up with her best friend might help. She clicked on her number and waited while it rang. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Well if it isn’t Rio fucking Vidal, as I live and breathe.” </span>
</em>
<span>Natasha answered, </span>
<em>
<span>“Fuck, I miss you, dude.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Nat,” Rio laughed. “I miss you too.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“What the fuck, Rio. Are you still with Jen in New York?” </span>
</em>
<span>Nat asked. </span>
<em>
<span>“It feels like we haven’t seen you in weeks.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes. “No, uhm… sort of. I have a project this side so…” she lied quickly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Let me guess. Your </span>
</em>
<span>‘project’ </span>
<em>
<span>goes by the name Jen… Tell me Rio, does the company know you are tending to more than one type of bush up there?” </span>
</em>
<span>Nat asked.</span>
</p><p>
<span>  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Oh, fuck off, Nat,” Rio laughed. God, she missed her friend. “How are you?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Good actually. Oh and Wanda says hi.” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio heard Wanda yelling from somewhere close to the phone. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Tell her I said hi back.” Rio smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
<em>
<span>“So… out with it. Why are you really calling?” Everything okay?” </span>
</em>
<span>Nat asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed audibly and started speaking carefully. “I’m a bit overwhelmed actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Rio, let’s be honest, your longest relationship has been with that one hoodie you insisted on wearing for two weeks straight. No wonder you are scared.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked, “It was three weeks and I cried when the dry cleaners tore it up.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“My point being, relationships are scary sometimes, but you deserve to be happy. Even if it is with that robot Jen, which I still struggle to wrap my head around. How did that even happen?”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio wished she could correct Nat and tell her about Agatha, but for now, she kept up the farce. “Yeah, things just happen sometimes I guess…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Well like I said Rio, you deserve happiness and love and all the romantic shit that comes with it. I never believed in it till Wands really, and now, I’m a fucking marshmallow in her hands. I see hearts and roses and… it’s disgusting really.” </span>
</em>
<span>Nat said. The line went quiet for a second</span>
<em>
<span>. “You know Rio. I will kill you if you ever repeat this to anyone… I have never been happier than I am now. I love being married to that woman and I turn to goo every time I see her. You want that. You </span>
</em>
<span>need</span>
<em>
<span> that. It’s literally life changing.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh god, you’re a sap.” Rio teased. “But I get it. I really do.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I have to go, the missus and I have a date night. Please tell Jen I need to see you and she can’t have you forever.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I will. Enjoy your date.” Rio greeted as she ended the call. She understood every word Nat said about being in love. Only she felt the same way about Agatha. She wanted to yell it from the rooftops, but she had to wait. For now.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio got dressed in her pajamas and pulled her snoopy slippers on. It felt too early to go to bed and she hadn’t said good night to Agatha yet. She crossed the short distance to Agatha’s room and knocked softly on the door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha opened the door slowly. “He’s just gone to sleep.” she whispered. Agatha stepped out of the room and closed the door behind her. “Sorry it took so long.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s okay, I’m sure he’s a bit freaked out.” Rio said. “This house is…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Haunted?” Agatha teased.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Feels a bit like it is.” Rio laughed. “Want to go downstairs and see if Lilia has ice cream?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha bounced excitedly, “Fuck I hope there is!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia’s cold room didn’t have ice cream, but Rio found a box of Oreos and some kind of cream liqueur. “It’s called improvising,” she said, as she crushed the cookies in a coffee mug and poured a healthy shot of the liqueur over it.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio handed the mug to Agatha who scrunched up her face as she smelled the strong alcohol of the drenched cookies.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, are you trying to get me drunk with this?” Agatha scoffed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Baby,” Rio laughed, “It’s like one shot of cream liqueur, that’ll hardly give you a buzz.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They slid down onto the floor in the dark kitchen, sitting shoulder to shoulder on the tiled floor eating Rio’s desert concoction.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s actually not bad.” Agatha giggled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah? Told you.” Rio said, nudging Agatha’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rested her head on Rio’s shoulder and Rio felt her heart warm and her body urging to hold her, to protect her somehow.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This could be so simple.” Agatha said so softly, Rio almost missed it. “We could have had this, </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>, without, you know…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know,” Rio sighed, kissing the top of Agatha’s head. She wishes she could take this all away, keep her safe without having to hide out somewhere. “When this is all over, we’ll have this, and more. I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked up at Rio and Rio felt every nerve in her body spark. The love she was starting to feel for her overwhelmed every part of her being and she suddenly fought the urge to cry. Rio wasn’t a crier, never was, but since reconnecting with Agatha, Rio felt everything and apparently that translated to fucking tears, happy, in love, </span>
<em>
<span>I-can’t-believe-you-are-real </span>
</em>
<span>tears.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Instead, Rio took the mug from Agatha’s hand and pulled her up with her, holding her close, hands holding Agatha firmly on her hips. Rio rested her head against Agatha’s and felt her bringing her hands up and around the back of her neck. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>For a moment they stayed there in silence before Agatha lifted her chin and kissed her so incredibly gentle, Rio felt her knees buckling. Rio tilted her head and intensified the kiss pulling her closer feeling Agatha’s tongue dance slowly over hers. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We can’t do this here,” Agatha mumbled against her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hm-hmm” Rio murmured in agreement, taking the opportunity to trail kisses down Agatha’s neck. Maybe it was the buzz from one shot of the liqueur or maybe it was the intoxicating smell of Agatha’s perfume, but Rio felt hypnotized. Her hands moving on their own accord and her hips bucking into Agatha’s. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha‘s hand moved to Rio’s chest and she pressed her backwards, breaking Rio’s hungry lips away from her neck. Rio moaned at the loss of contact and protested internally to comply and let Agatha slow them down.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s go upstairs,” Agatha spoke softly, “I would prefer to have you all to myself and this kitchen echoes.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio breathed a laugh, “Fine,” she smiled, only a tiny bit frustrated. “I hope </span>
<em>
<span>The Barn</span>
</em>
<span> is sound proof.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed quietly and took Rio’s hand and Rio let herself be led to wherever Agatha was going, even if it were straight into a fire. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Luckily it wasn’t a fire pit, but rather Rio’s room right across from Agatha’s suite. For obvious reasons they avoided the suite not wanting to disturb Nicky who was hopefully sleeping soundly in the adjoining room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha led Rio into her bedroom and Rio followed willingly and let herself be pushed onto the bed gently, while watching the siren in front of her undressing slowly. Without Rio’s knowing, her own hands started to lift her pajama top over her head and she kept her eyes fixed to Agatha as she removed the last of her clothes. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood like a statue of a goddess, panting slightly and Rio worshipped the sight before her. “I can’t stand you this far away from me,” Rio said, lifting herself on all fours and extending her arm to take hold of Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled Agatha to the edge of the bed and stood on her knees on the bed to meet Agatha’s face. She cupped her cheeks and tucked a stray piece of hair behind her ear, feeling Agatha’s breathing intensifying with her touch. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Their mouths met with a passionate kiss and Agatha’s arms enveloped Rio in a tight embrace, pressing their bodies close, melting into one another. Rio felt an urgency in Agatha’s kisses, her hands grabbed at her back and hips and she nipped at the skin at the base of her neck, probably leaving marks as far as she went. Rio couldn’t give a fuck if she looked like a bruised peach the next day, she was Agatha’s to have.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio moved backwards on her knees and laid down on her back, allowing Agatha to straddle her thighs. Rio felt Agatha’s warmth seeping from her core instantly when their bodies met, and Rio bit her lip in anticipation, “Agatha, I can practically feel you dripping over me.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rocked her pelvis forward and Rio gasped as Agatha let out a low groan. “Come here,” Rio said, pulling Agatha down to kiss her. Rio cupped her breast with one hand as their mouths fought to devour the other. She found the sensitive bud and flicked and squeezed, earning another moan and thrust from Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Before she could do the same with Agatha’s other breast, Rio’s hand was grabbed and forced above her head, along with her other hand letting Agatha pin them above her head. “I’ll tell you when you can touch me.” Agatha spoke against her ear and Rio’s whole body erupted in goosebumps. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh fuck,” Rio whispered as she realized what was happening. Agatha was taking control and Rio would submit and relinquish her entire being willingly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just tell me when it gets too much?” Agatha said, moving her hot mouth down her neck. Rio nodded wordlessly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tongued at her left nipple and pinched her right and Rio squirmed and bit her lip to try and concentrate on not bringing her hands down to touch and grab at Agatha. She wasn’t going to last long like this…</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>With a long wet lick down her sternum to her navel, Agatha moved down her body at an agonizingly slow pace, trailing a string of goosebumps in her wake. Agatha bit the soft skin above Rio’s bellybutton and Rio let out a frustrated giggle, “Agatha, that actually tickles.” she moaned. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand suddenly flew down to grab at Agatha’s hair and as soon as her fingers folded in Agatha’s locks, Agatha pulled up, lifting her hands from Rio’s body. Rio realized her mistake instantly, “Fuck, sorry!” she said, pulling her hands back above her head. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I said, no touching.” Agatha said. Rio could feel Agatha’s intense eyes on hers, “Only when I say you can.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah… forgot… Please don’t stop.” Rio managed to get out.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stayed upright, kneeling between Rio’s legs, but her hands returned to Rio’s body, moving slowly down her stomach to her thighs. Agatha spread Rio’s legs and moved her hands back down her inner thighs, stopping just before she touched Rio where she so desperately wanted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“If you promise not to touch me or yourself, I will let you come.” Agatha warned and Rio nodded frantically.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I p.. I promise,” she stuttered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha accepted her answer and finally moved her hands to Rio’s dripping folds. “</span>
<em>
<span>Fuccck…” </span>
</em>
<span>Rio moaned as Agatha didn’t waste time, and rubbed two fingers firmly up from her entrance to her clit, moving her wetness through her folds.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A few more slides of her fingers up and down left Rio in a writhing mess as she bucked her hips up to get more. Agatha responded by slowly moving her fingers down and into her. Rio held a breath as she felt Agatha’s fingers move and curl and stretch inside her, hitting the perfect spot every time. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>With her other hand Agatha concentrated on Rio’s clit. When her one hand moved into Rio, the other hand moved over her clit, tugging and pinching every now and then and Rio was fucking done for. “P-please, Agatha, baby… I can’t hold… I need to c…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Already?” Agatha asked sarcastically. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please…” Rio whined. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Alright, on my count…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Was she seriously giving her orgasm a count down?</span>
</em>
<span> Rio thought, but Agatha’s pace quickened and Rio’s release was building and threatening to explode.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“One.” Agatha said, adding another finger and Rio moaned loudly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Two.” Agatha continued, curling her fingers up and Rio held her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Three…” Agatha finally said, and Rio felt her floodgates open and release finally came. She grabbed at the sheets and pillows around her and Agatha never stopped moving her hands, pulling her over the edge once again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio lost all control and sat up, pulling Agatha’s face onto hers and kissed her desperately, still moaning as Agatha’s unrelenting pace kept her third orgasm building. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I said no…” Agatha tried to speak against her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck that…” Rio said, “I need to touch you.” Suddenly Rio wished she had more hands, two wouldn’t do this perfect woman of hers any justice.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>*******************</span>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The next morning Rio sat sipping her coffee as she stared out over the manicured lawn of Lilia’s mansion. At least she had a beautiful garden, Rio thought. She felt warm arms slip around her from behind and turned her head to kiss Agatha. “Morning, beautiful.” Rio whispered. “Where’s Nic?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Gerald took him to feed the horses again.” Agatha said, turning Rio around in her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh,” Rio managed to get out before Agatha pulled her in for a passionate kiss. Rio almost dropped her coffee mug to grab onto Agatha as the kiss deepened. Agatha pushed Rio up to the closest wall she could find and Rio nearly melted in her arms. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t stop thinking about last night.” Agatha whispered between breaths. Rio felt Agatha’s thigh press up against her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Me… </span>
<em>
<span>fuck… </span>
</em>
<span>me too.” Rio answered breathlessly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned into the kiss again, and Rio wished she had teleportation powers to blip them into the nearest bedroom.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span> “Ladies, there’s breakfast… oh…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stilled her movements instantly and felt her whole body freeze. Agatha jumped away and both of them probably looked like two deer caught in headlights as they stared wide eyed at Lilia and to Rio’s absolute horror, Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Gross.” Nicky said, scrunching his face and covering his eyes. Rio could have died right there. “Get a room mom.” he said and turned around to walk to the dining room. “You’re lucky I haven’t eaten yet.” He called out.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio looked at Agatha who looked like she was about to faint. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Come, eat something before you eat each other.” Lilia said following Nicky.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio walked silently to the table and sat down opposite Nicky who already filled his plate with one of each of the breakfast pastries on the table.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The table was dead quiet as Nicky stuffed a pastry in his mouth and looked up at Rio. “So Rio,” he said with a full mouth. “What are your intentions with… Agatha?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smirked and Agatha spit out her orange juice next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky.” Agatha said warningly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, as your one and only son and protector, I have to ask these things.” Nicky said casually. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio cleared her throat which had gone bone dry since they were interrupted earlier, “My intentions… right.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes so, now that you’ve… you know… kissed. I think I need to know. Do you plan on kissing her again? Like in a </span>
<em>
<span>girlfriends </span>
</em>
<span>way?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio turned to give a quick glance at Agatha. “I would like to. If that is okay with you.” Rio said, trying to hold back a laugh. She had to admit, Nicky did inherit his mother’s death stare and for a seven year old he was terribly intimidating, even if he was covered in flakes of pastry.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched as Nicky bit into another pastry. Some more flakes fell onto his chest. “I am okay with it.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio let out a breath. She felt an instant relief. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Before we get too excited, there are rules.” Nicky said, lifting his hand.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicholas, this isn’t…” Agatha started.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, I’ve got this. Please eat your breakfast.” Nicky interrupted, taking another bite of the pastry. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio squeezed Agatha’s thigh under the table. She loved this, as scary as it was, but she couldn’t help loving this kid even more than she already did. “Rules, okay. I understand.” She nodded, winking at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Number one. Pancake Sundays stays.” Nicky said, lifting a finger.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.” Rio agreed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Number two. We have to play Minecraft again. You haven’t finished building the homebase and I need your help.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agreed.” Rio smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And number three. You have to promise to be nice to mom. She doesn’t look so sad anymore and I think you are helping.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart was busting in her chest and when she looked at Agatha, she was also getting teary. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I promise I will, Nicky.” she said, smiling at him. Rio felt Agatha take her hand under the table, “I’ll never hurt you or your mom.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, then you may kiss again. But not too much in front of me. I don’t need to see that, I am only seven.” Nicky said, shaking his head.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio and Agatha laughed through the tears falling from their eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky?” Rio asked. “Is it okay if I give her one quick kiss now?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looked between the two of them, “I’ll allow it.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed Agatha’s cheek and quickly turned back to the table. She smiled at Nicky and the kid cheekily winked at her. She shook her head, these two Harkness’ were going to be the death of her, she thought smiling to herself. </span>

<p>
<span>The prison system for young girls was brutal, but for a 14 year old delinquent it meant a bed and a warm meal every day, not that she would ever call the slop they served in the dining hall a </span>
<em>
<span>warm meal</span>
</em>
<span>. At least it was more than she was accustomed to at home. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Qiaolian grew up in a small apartment in the slums of Beijing with her parents and sister. They had very little and had even less to look forward to other than hoping to get a decent paying job in the city after finishing school or to somehow leave China in pursuit of greener pastures. Her parents worked in the service industry. Her father was a custodian at their school and her mother worked as a cleaning lady at a run down hotel close to their home. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Despite working their asses off, they barely made ends meet and getting food on the table became a daily struggle. When Qiaolain was old enough to understand their dire situation, she decided to do whatever she could to help her parents and eventually resorted to petty crimes, stealing food, clothes and other goods to sell to help pay the rent for their shoddy one bedroom apartment.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She wasn’t the only kid in town fighting for the survival of her family, and eventually that resulted in her falling into some very unsavory crowds. One night while trying to get what she needed for her family, she ended up being part of a small group of teenagers trying to hijack and rob a delivery truck and that was how she ended up in debt with the Cobalt Serpents. Before she knew it she was initiated and part of the dangerous gang. Drugs, weapons, you name it, anything was trade and everything had a price, be it in dollars or in lives.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She actually managed to survive the first two years as part of the gang without being caught by the authorities and the extra income she managed to get for her family was more than welcome. She explained the sudden influx of spare cash and food as getting a job at a grocer, keeping her involvement with the gang a secret from her family. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It was on one of the gang’s latest seedy operations where she ended up being caught and thrown in prison with the other members who worked with her that night. Their mission to move a gross amount of heroin went horribly wrong. She watched her best friend violently get shot and others injured and barely escaped injury herself. Unfortunately she was caught, tried and thrown in jail until her 18th birthday. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Walking out of the gates of the prison a dark van was waiting for her and the rest of her life was determined just then. The freedom she dreamt she could have after spending two years behind bars in horrible conditions, was just that, a pipedream. Instead she fell right back into the gang’s claws, this time older and </span>
<em>
<span>experienced</span>
</em>
<span>, she was taken under the wing of the big boss of the Serpents, Shétóu a.k.a. Snake Head. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Like the meaning of his name he was the ruthless leader of the Serpents. He was a man of power and influence, hiding in plain sight as the head of a rehabilitation center for young women exciting the prison system. Under his guise, he took in and trained the young women to be spies and assassins for hire. With her included they were a total of at least fifteen girls living in the compound being trained and eventually sent off to wherever they were needed, scattered across the world on their own missions.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She was happy at the compound. She made new friends and grew stronger every day. Her new life came with an excellent education and even better training in combat and black ops. When she was ready, she got her first orders and was shipped off to a new country on her first official solo mission.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>For the next few months she settled into her new undercover persona. Now known as Gina, she worked in a local hardware store, waiting for her target to be close enough to take out. Admittedly, she lived comfortably. She had a small cozy apartment and enjoyed her quiet life in the small German town she now called home. Her old life as Qiaolain, completely forgotten.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>All things considered, she was lonely. Something she never really had was real love, and a life with the Serpents didn’t make that any easier to get. When she was back in town after finally tracking down and eliminating her target in the town next over, she took a well deserved break, nursing a drink in the local bar of a small German town. There she met and eventually fell in love with Lisa, a local woman who stole her heart and let her believe that a simple life outside of the Serpents could be possible. Suddenly she found herself wanting to rather build a future with this woman instead of the life of crime she had come accustomed to.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>One call on her burner phone, letting her know of her next mission and target, changed everything. After the call ended she made the impulsive decision of tossing the phone into the river below her, and ultimately running away with her new girlfriend, eventually settling in a small rural town across the border where they settled in a cozy apartment with their two cats. For almost a year, life felt good and she was finally free. Or so she thought.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Late one night after a long day’s work, she walked home to their apartment. It was snowing gently around her and the smell of mulled wine hung in the air. Opening the front door to the apartment, she fell to her knees. Her heart broke as she cried out in physical pain. Unfortunately, this was a scene she wasn’t a stranger to. She has left worse herself, but those people were faceless. This time, the face staring blankly up at her in a pool of blood was that of her first love, Lisa. And next to her bloody body, a note.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Once a Serpent, always a Serpent. </span>
</em>
<span>    </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They found her and just like that, she was back in the claws of the Serpents. That was how she found herself living in the USA. Back to her life as a paid assassin in the grips of the life she desperately tried to escape, only this time her mission included a family and friends and a little boy who she tried her best to ignore and not love. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She thought she had turned cold after losing Lisa, leading her to believe she would be capable of staying cold and unaffected by those around her. So when her old handler approached her for her new mission, she had no reason not to agree to infiltrate the small town of Westview as Melinda May, to befriend a stranger, keep her close and eventually turn her in when the time came. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>But as time went by she fell in love with the target’s ex-wife and their little brown eyed boy. She always imagined her punishment would be brutal for all the violence and murder that littered her past but this was a punishment worse than she had ever imagined. Now she had no idea how to get out of this mess. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her number was finally called and she had to </span>
<em>
<span>deliver</span>
</em>
<span> the target to some drug dealer over Thanksgiving weekend. Just as she was originally tasked to do. Except now she had collateral she cared about. Failing her mission meant the death of her girlfriend Maria and her son Nicky. This was worse than collateral. This was </span>
<em>
<span>her</span>
</em>
<span> family now, who she really loved. And Agatha, her target, was her close friend. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>To top it all off and make things even more complicated, she was contracted by Lilia for the same reason, to keep an eye on and to protect Agatha. Her handler encouraged her to get involved with Lilia when the call came. She would have more access to her target this way. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Melinda May was now a double agent. A double agent without a fucking contingency plan.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After realising she fell in love with Maria she wanted out of the mission and over the years she has done her best to work against them on this mission. Every time they got close to Agatha she redirected them, letting Agatha get away for just a moment longer, but this time it would not be that easy. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>This time there was no escape, no way to let Agatha slip through their fingers once again. They gave her a clear warning. Hand over Agatha Harkness or hand over Maria and Nicky. There would be room for mistakes this time.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>At least for now, Agatha and Nicky were safe and hidden away for the time being at Lilia’s safe house and Maria was with her, safe for now, but despite that, she was spiraling. There was no getting away from her mission anymore, Ralph was coming and she had her orders. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>********</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A few months ago after an amazing night spent in the arms of Maria after they made love, Maria asked if Melinda wanted to have a baby with her. In the moment, Melinda forgot herself and her actual reason for being in Westview for the mission for a second and agreed without hesitation. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>In her heart of hearts she knew she wanted this, she would change everything she could to get it because she loved Maria with everything she was, and if she were any other person who could have any other life she would have wanted a life exactly like the one she was faking. A loving partner and a family she could take care of and love until her old age. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>But that was never really in the cards for her. Even before she joined the Serpents she knew that. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Melinda already knew that after next week she will have to disappear again, leaving her life in Westview behind, her dream gone. Her mission will be over after Thanksgiving weekend and when everyone found out that it was her who betrayed and </span>
<em>
<span>delivered</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha to Ralph, she knew that there was no chance in hell of ever getting her loved one’s forgiveness. Her dream life would be gone forever. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Melinda painfully stared at their house in front of her, the one she shared with Maria. She thought back to the conversation they had last night where they planned to finally start with the construction of the additional bedroom for their future addition to the family. What a happy life they could have had.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly her burner phone buzzed in her pocket.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>Unknown: It’s agreed. The parade would be the perfect opportunity. Make sure she is ready at the location.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>This had always been the mission, and under different circumstances she would have done it without any conscious or hesitation. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The plan to deliver Agatha was simple. The Westview Thanksgiving Parade on Thursday would be the perfect cover for her to get Agatha in a public space, and with the two neighboring towns and tourists attending the parade there would be enough chaos to isolate her from her family, and when the time came Ralph’s guys would capture her and everything would be over. Lastly, Melinda would disappear after making sure Maria and Nicky were safe.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fucck!!!!” she yelled, banging her hands on the steering wheel of her car. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She had to figure something out, get Agatha away. Somehow. The only person she knew who would be able to help was Lilia, no matter how she would react, she had to try, even if it meant losing Maria eventually, at least she could try something, without losing her loved ones to Ralph.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She dialed the number on her phone to call Lilia.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Q” </span>
</em>
<span>Lilia answered. No words, like usual.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Can we meet?” Melinda asked, looking around the car to check that she wouldn’t be disturbed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“The stables, 19:00.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Perfect.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>********</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Melinda drove to the stables taking the hidden backroad like she always did when meeting at Lilia’s safe house. From far away she saw the lights of the house shining out onto the long stretch of grass. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Walking up to the stables Melinda went over her plan to tell Lilia and try to protect Agatha once again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What’s this about, Q.” Lilia asked from inside one of the stables.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Melinda took a breath, taking in a cold rush of air into her lungs, hoping it would calm her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re coming for her, Lilia.” she said plainly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia looked at her without any expression. A short silence passed between them. “When?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanksgiving parade. I can’t stop it this time.” she admitted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She could see Lilia taking in and finally understanding that she was working for </span>
<em>
<span>them</span>
</em>
<span> too.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry Lilia. I tried, but this time I can’t distract them. They’ll… Maria… Nicky…” Melinda looked away sternly, trying desperately to inhibit her emotions.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia sighed, and turned to look back up at the house in the distance. Melinda grew nervous with each passing silent second. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Finally Lilia spoke. “All this time... We trusted you. </span>
<em>
<span>She </span>
</em>
<span>trusted you. And now, at the last minute you suddenly get a conscious?” Lilia sounded furious. After another pained silence she continued.  “We need to get Maria out of Westview, or to the safe house at least.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t think that would be a problem. I will bring her tomorrow.” Melinda said affirmatively.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No. I’ll call Alice to bring Maria. If anything happens, this will be on you, Q. I don’t care what your intentions were, but you may as well have put a bullet in all three of their heads yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia turned around sharply and walked back into the darkness, leaving Melinda to grapple with her words. </span>
<em>
<span>If anything happens, this will be on you.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh and Q,” Lilia said from a distance. “When you leave here, lose my number.” </span>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Now that the cat was out of the bag and Nicky finished his inquisition on Rio and their relationship, Agatha floated through the mansion with a permanent smile on her face. The reality that they were hiding from Ralph and his goons wasn’t lost on her, but somehow in the chaos of it all and hiding out in Lilia’s secret mansion, she was really enjoying her mini breakaway with her son, girlfriend and godmother.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s security units were patrolling the grounds frequently and checking in with them to make sure they were safe, but Agatha still hasn’t heard back from her yet and Alice should’ve had something by now. Their stay in the safe house was initially only planned until Sunday, but with no word from Alice, Agatha started to feel like they were in for a much longer stay than anticipated.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After breakfast and a stroll to the stalls with Nicky, Agatha and Rio were lounging in the comfortable library. Lilia had stacks and stacks of books. Fiction, biographies, history books, everything. Agatha couldn't decide on what she wanted to take off the shelves to keep busy with, while Rio was already nose deep in the </span>
<em>
<span>History of Salem</span>
</em>
<span>. Instead, Agatha nuzzled herself under Rio’s arm while she quietly read to them. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” Rio said. “I kind of love this.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha asked, looking up at her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This. You and me, cuddling up with a book. Nicky running around with the horses. It’s like our own little family vacation.” Rio explained.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, take away the literal axe hanging over our heads, and this would actually be perfect.” Agatha agreed. Agatha leaned up to kiss Rio just below the chin. “And now that Nicky knows about </span>
<em>
<span>us</span>
</em>
<span>, I actually wish it was really our family vacation. It just feels… right.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know love. I wish that too.” Rio said, hugging Agatha under her arm.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A few more moments of quiet reading passed and Agatha felt like she could stay like this forever. Rio’s soft voice reading to her, comforting her. This was the kind of love she always dreamt of. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I wonder what Lilia’s up to?” Agatha said after a while.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She was in her study last time I heard. She mentioned she was working on some high profile case with Wanda.” Rio said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll go check. I could grab us some cocoa on the way back if you like?” Agatha asked, getting up from her warm cocoon.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I will love you forever if you do.” Rio winked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blushed. “So cocoa was the trick all this time?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That, and your adorable butt.” Rio joked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed as she walked out of the library towards Lilia’s study. She peaked through the door and saw that it was empty and headed to the kitchen instead. She turned on the kettle and got the mugs ready, adding another one for Nicky. Daydreaming, she stared out of the kitchen window overlooking the small courtyard garden.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The kettle whistled, breaking her out of her daydream and she blinked awake to pour the steaming water into the cups. Stirring the chocolate mixture in the cups she heard the soft pad of footsteps enter the kitchen.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You know,” Lilia spoke from behind her. “I used to sneak cups of cocoa to you when you would come along to those late night meetings with your mother.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha remembered those nights where her mother would agree to take her along to Lilia’s when they had to work late on a case. Agatha used to think of those nights as an escape from her mother’s hold. She got to huddle in front of the television, which she was never really allowed to do, and watch all the Disney movies her friends used to tell her about, and on colder nights, Lilia would sneak her a cup of warm cocoa without her mother knowing. Another thing Agatha never got to have, because </span>
<em>
<span>children shouldn’t need sweet things</span>
</em>
<span>. Very Trunchbull-like. </span>
<em>
<span>“Much too good for children” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha would replay the Matilda quote in her head.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I remember,” Agatha said with a slow smile. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Lilia shared a quiet moment, both reminiscing of a time far in the past, less complicated, even with Evanora still present.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Aggie, we have a problem.” Lilia said after a while.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha froze in place, of course the quiet was too good to be true.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please come to my office when you are ready, we need to discuss something.” Lilia said leaving the kitchen and Agatha behind.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted the tray with the three mugs of cocoa with shaky hands and walked over to the library. Her heart beat heavily in her chest.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags, you okay?” Rio asked when she saw Agatha’s worried expression.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I need to talk to Lilia, can you get Nicky and keep him with you please?” Agatha said, her hand pulling through her hair.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t protest or prod any further and Agatha appreciated that silently. “Okay.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you,” Agatha said, bending down to kiss Rio’s temple. “I’ll come get you after.” Agatha smiled down at Rio, her big brown eyes stared searchingly into her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha left the library and headed to Lilia’s office. When she stepped inside, she closed the door behind her. Lilia’s office suddenly felt like the principal's office, intimidating and cold. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“What happened, Lilia?” Agatha asked cautiously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“They’re coming, Agatha,” Lilia said bluntly. “For you. There was a leak, so to say, one of my informants turned out to be a double agent. I am sorry, but there was no way to know that this could happen.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“One of your… Dottie?” Agatha had tears in her eyes suddenly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, not Dottie.” Lilia pressed her lips together, “Who doesn’t matter now. What matters is that we get you and your family away from this. As far as possible from Westview, and as soon as possible.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t understand. If it wasn’t Dottie…” Agatha racked her brain, the only other person she knew who had ties to Lilia other than Dottie was… “I’ll kill her.” Agatha said harshly as the realization hit her, “I fucking knew it!” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ag…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Melinda fucking May?” Agatha said pacing with her hands on her hips, she was fuming. “My fucking son </span>
<em>
<span>lives</span>
</em>
<span> with them, Lilia. How could you?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, believe me, there was no way of knowing. These… </span>
<em>
<span>people </span>
</em>
<span>come with no backgrounds, no track record other than those who recommended them. They are ghosts for a reason and well, she was. And she was clearly great at it because no one, not even Ralph knows that she has been working for both sides.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She works for </span>
<em>
<span>Ralph?</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha yelled, falling into the seat behind her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wasn’t that clear with what I just said?” Lilia asked confused, “Look, somewhere she had to have a change of heart…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re defending her now?” Agatha asked, interrupting Lilia.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Lilia sighed, “What she did is unforgivable, but what I am trying to say is that somewhere she must have started… caring for you and your family enough to thwart their previous attempts at finding you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked. There had been other attempts and she was just living her life in oblivion, so fucking stupid. “I’m such an idiot.” she cried into her hands.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“How could you have known, Agatha?” Lilia asked gently.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, not about that.” Agatha said, looking up at her. “For thinking I could ever have… happiness. My mother knew this about me, she always said I wasn’t meant to be here, let alone live a normal happy life. Looks like mommy dearest was right all along.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You cannot believe that Agatha, look at what you’ve made for yourself,” Lilia said, crossing the room to sit next to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What I </span>
<em>
<span>made</span>
</em>
<span> for myself, Lilia, is a whole family of people I love, who never deserved to be put in any danger.” Agatha said between her sobs. “I may as well have handed them over to Ralph myself.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hated herself. If she ever had, now she hated herself even more. Her beautiful son... When he was born she promised him that no harm would come to him, that he will be loved and grow up surrounded by a life of love and care. Her friends, her ex-wife Maria, Rio… she was an atomic bomb waiting to blow and eviscerate everyone in her wake.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ralph should have just killed me ten years ago.” Agatha admitted quietly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia cupped her face, her own tears ran down her face, “Aggie, you deserve love. You deserve a life. I made a promise to you back in the courthouse and I have kept that promise. Nothing will get to you. I will make sure of it.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha closed her eyes tightly, pulled away from Lilia, got up and walked to the door of the office. Her hand stilled on the door. “I love you Lilia.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you too, dear.” Lilia replied quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stood outside of Lilia’s office, her head felt heavy and her arms were weighing her down. She knew that Lilia tried her best to keep her safe, but the reality of Ralph knowing where she was, knowing about her family, that scared the shit out of her. Could she trust and wait for Lilia to rescue her this time?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just then a loud sound filled the corridors, someone was yelling. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha ran towards the sound, only when she came to the foyer where the screaming was coming from, she saw Alice and Maria, who was being held back by a large man in a suit.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice, tell me what the </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span> I am doing here!” Maria yelled, pulling herself out of the man’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Maria?” Agatha asked, surprised.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria’s head snapped to her, “Agatha? What the fuck…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice, what is she doing here?” Agatha asked, moving to Maria and placing herself between her and Alice. “Where is Melinda?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh fuck, Agatha, not this again.” Maria snapped. Agatha turned her head to Maria and sharply back to Alice.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Lilia called me to bring her here. Melinda is at the station. She’s being… taken care of.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Taken care of? If someone doesn’t tell me what the fuck is going on here right now…” Maria yelled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Not here.” Agatha said. “Alice, please get your </span>
<em>
<span>suit</span>
</em>
<span> to go outside, he’s scaring her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice notioned for the man to go outside. Agatha nodded her a thank you and took Maria’s hand. “Let’s talk.” she said to Maria. “Alice, Rio and Nicky are in the library, please keep them there while I explain this fuckery to Maria.”</span>
</p><p>
<span>  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Okay, Agatha.” Alice said and left. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha led Maria to the lounge and sat her down on the sofa. Maria looked bewildered and confused, to her credit she didn’t look like she wanted to kill Agatha, which was a good start.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, please just tell me what the hell is happening? Alice had her guys shove me in a car and drove me out here to, whatever this fucking place is and…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Maria, breathe please. I will tell you everything, just calm down first… please.” Agatha said, taking her hand in hers.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Okay, fine.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath and stared out of the window trying to gather her thoughts.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This is going to sound crazy, but I guess it is time you knew the truth about me.” Agatha sighed, “Ten years ago, I witnessed a double homicide next to my apartment building. Some drug gang related thing. I had to testify against them in court and when they were found guilty I was put in witness protection. They moved me here to Westview, and I became Agatha Harkness.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria looked at her with a furrowed brow. “Became?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I was Agnes O’Connor before the trial. I lived in Philadelphia, I was finishing my degree and then, one Halloween night my whole life changed. After the trial, they threatened to kill me, so I had to become Agatha to hide from them and to save my life. My mother… well she was their lawyer, and she somehow got his sentence reduced and now he is out and on the hunt for me again, and now it seems like somehow he… found me.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags… I,” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know Maria, I put you all in so much danger.” Agatha said crying, “When I first moved to Westview I really tried to keep to myself. Only go to my job then home, no social interactions, nothing, but then I met you and then Nicky happened and I stupidly thought that I could actually have this, this freedom, love, but I was so fucking dumb, so naive to think that my fucking mother would ever let me have anything resembling happiness.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha wiped the tears off her face with her hands. Somehow through all the chaos, it felt freeing to be able to finally tell Maria the truth. “You remember when you said I was always hiding something from you…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags, If I had known it was </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span>…” Maria said softly. “Does Nicky know?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No,” Agatha answered quickly, “He doesn’t need to know.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And Rio?” Maria asked hesitantly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled. “That’s the thing actually, that makes this all so bittersweet. That night, the night of the murders, that was the night I first met her. She was at a friend's party and we just… clicked. We spent the whole night talking and she drove with me to my apartment and when she left and I walked to my apartment, that was when I saw them… I disappeared right after that. So the other night at Tony’s, Alice introduced me to her new girlfriend Jen, who happened to be my old roommate in Philly… she called Rio, and the rest, well.. That's where we are now. We just sort of… picked up where we left off ten years ago I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I always felt like a bit of a placeholder to be honest.” Maria admitted. The sadness in her voice was evident.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, please don’t ever think that, Maria.” Agatha said, clasping her hands. “You are my best friend, and the mother of my son. I wouldn’t trade our life together for a second.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you for saying that, Ags.” Maria let out a huff of air. Her eyes were red from crying herself. “So I’m two for two now I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Why?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Melinda, or whoever she is…” Maria spoke again, letting the tears run down her cheek, “I guess that was all a lie too.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry Maria. Somehow, this is all my fault.” Agatha said, hugging her. “I’m sorry.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They sat like that, in silence for a while, when Lilia, Alice and Rio walked into the lounge. Agatha watched them all spread out in the lounge, some sitting and some remained standing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Where’s Nicky?” Agatha asked. He wasn’t with them.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“He is with Gerald at the stables.” Rio said, reassuring her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We have this place on lockdown Agatha.” Alice said, “The FBI is on the case now, they have intercepted Ralph’s comms, thanks to Dennis actually. He was very forthcoming after we let him spend a few hours in a cell. He sang like a fucking bird. We were able to track the parcel he delivered back to an account owned by a “Verona Roo Conan”…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s Evanora.” Lila chipped in.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Agatha all but yelled out.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“My sources traced an offshore account to that name. It’s an anagram for Evanora O’Connor.” Lilia said, taking a seat on a large leather wingback chair.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fucking bitch.” Alice mumbled. “Lilia, I will need that trace. We need to get it to the Bureau immediately. They’ve been looking for her for years.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Of course.” Lilia said, “But my source stays anonymous.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I will try my best.” Alice said.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The atmosphere in the room felt loaded, a heavy silence settled over everyone. Agatha’s head was spinning with all the information. Her mother was behind this. Fuck Ralph, that guy had a vendetta, but her actual fucking mother… “Fuck…” she whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I think with Lilia’s information and what we got from Dennis and Melinda, I think they might actually catch him for good this time, and Evanora is screwed. And Melinda, she turned herself in at the station earlier today.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So what now?” Rio asked. Agatha’s eyes met hers. Just her being here was dangerous, but Agatha couldn’t have done this without her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It means, you all stay put here.” Alice said, “No leaving the safe house, we’ll take care of the rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And Melinda?” Maria asked, hopeful.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I don’t know yet.” Alice answered. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed Maria’s hand. She knew what that meant. Melinda was gone and Maria would probably never see her again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>**************</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After everyone processed all the revelations of the day, the house turned quiet. Eerily so. Maria and Nicky spent the rest of the afternoon in the library, Alice and Lilia worked through the information she had in her office and Rio and Agatha retreated to Rio’s room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was curled up to Rio’s side under a throw blanket. “I can’t believe my mother is behind all of this. I wouldn’t be surprised if she was the real head of that drug gang actually. She’s evil enough. I wonder if she’s also clever enough to find his place.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey,” Rio said, kissing the top of her head. “Alice said we’ll be safe here. I think we should trust her with this.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And you?” Agatha asked, “Aren’t you regretting all of this yet?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I mean, I never imagined myself being part of a Stephen King thriller, but if you’re asking if I regret meeting Agatha Harkness… the answer is no.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha melted, her tears fell from her eyes again, “I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I love you too, Ags.” Rio said, lifting her chin to kiss her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>For now, they were safe. For now.</span>

<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha woke up to a warm palm moving in slow, barely there circles on her stomach. Her eyes opened, straining to make out anything in the darkness of the room. A faint beam of light snuck through below the blinds, it was morning but too early for the sun to rise.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The palm on her stomach stilled for a brief moment and began moving again, “You awake?” she heard Rio whisper.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmmm,” Agatha answered sleepily, stretching her body below the warm weight pressed against her. “It’s so early, why are you awake?.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Couldn’t sleep.” Rio answered. Her hand began to move in bigger circles, causing a ripple of goosebumps to erupt all over Agatha’s body.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As the circles grew bigger, Rio’s touch grew bolder, teasing and caressing the soft skin below Agatha’s breasts with each turn. She arched her back into the soft hand instinctively, suddenly feeling the coil in her stomach tightening with every light brush of Rio’s fingers over her breasts.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Sensing the change and effects of her movements, Rio started kissing Agatha’s exposed skin peeking out over the collar of her pajama top. Agatha strained her neck to allow more access as Rio’s mouth moved closer to the spot right over her pulse point.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sighed a soft moan as her body reacted and her senses started to vibrate below Rio’s touch. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Kiss me,” Agatha asked breathlessly into the darkness.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Warm, determined lips found hers and Agatha felt Rio’s weight shift over her, straddling her below the covers. Agatha kissed her back eagerly, cupping her neck to keep Rio’s mouth on hers.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hips rolled over hers and Agatha felt her own arousal building higher as their breathing became staggered. Rio moaned into her mouth when Agatha moved her hand over Rio’s breast, thumbing the hardened nipple over her t-shirt.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>F-fuck</span>
</em>
<span>,” Rio whispered against her lips.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha let her hands trail lower to the hips grinding against her and lifted them, pulling at the hems of Rio’s boxers and underwear. “Take these off.” She asked between kisses.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio hurriedly pulled her clothes off but before she could retake her position over Agatha’s hips, Agatha pulled her hips up, moving Rio’s center up over her mouth. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha held Rio’s hips up as she slowly dragged her tongue through the soaked folds above her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my…</span>
<em>
<span> fuck…”</span>
</em>
<span> Rio moaned loudly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha lifted Rio up quickly, “As much as I would love to hear you scream, you’re going to have to keep it down, love.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio responded by grinding her hips down again letting go of a strangled huff. Agatha got to work, licking and lapping at Rio allowing her to grind over her face. She could feel Rio pulse against her tongue as she fought to restrain her moans.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A menacing thought crossed her mind and she brought her hand down pushing into Rio with two curled fingers. She heard Rio’s hand slap over her mouth to hide the cry escaping her chest as Agatha sucked her clit while curling her fingers just right against Rio’s pulsating walls.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The grinding body above her started shaking and Agatha added a third finger just before Rio’s resolve burst, coating her hands and face while grabbing at Agatha’s hair. Agatha smirked as she gave the sensitive nub one last tug with her lips. Rio almost jumped up, away from her face, falling back onto the bed with a loud cry.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I hope these walls are soundproof,” Agatha joked as she crawled up over Rio’s heaving body. “That last one probably woke the horses.” She teased, kissing along Rio’s clavicles.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed quietly, wrapping her arms around Agatha. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What a way to wake up,” Rio said, kissing the corner of Agatha’s mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmm, you got me all worked up before the sun’s up.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio unbuttoned the rest of Agatha’s pajama top and instantly took one of Agatha’s nipples between her lips. Agatha bit her lip to keep the loud noises inside her chest, but Rio’s hand cupped her wet core and Agatha felt a finger slip between her folds and she was gone for. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She frantically thrust her hips forward to get more friction against the teasing hand in her underwear. “Don’t. Tease.” She mumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pushed two fingers inside her and her thumb found Agatha’s waiting clit with each thrust. Agatha was losing her fucking mind as she rode the hand under her. Rio’s teeth grazed her nipple and before Agatha could stop it the tight coil in her snapped and she pulled herself up grinding harder over Rio’s hand to take more of her deeper. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Another wave crashed over her and she fell forward again on top of Rio’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck… your… your hands are fucking… amazing.“ Agatha panted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio chuckled, “You’re welcome.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha rolled her eyes “Don’t get cocky.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Wish I could, actually. I bet you would have loved riding my strap just now.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We would get kicked out of here for sure.” Agatha laughed, wrapping herself in Rio’s arms again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>**********</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The next days passed in a quiet nervous haze. Everyone decided to put in leave at work for the rest of the week under the guise of a family Thanksgiving trip. Technically it wasn’t a lie, since they were really spending the holiday away, together like a family.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice and Lilia and a few officers were almost constantly in her office, working through all the evidence to hand over to the FBI while the others tried to keep busy around the house, waiting for any news or any sign that this nightmare was finally over. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria mostly kept to herself it seemed, only joining them for meals or spending time with Nicky. But despite everything, they all lived together peacefully, well as much as possible. Maria was now sharing the suite Agatha had with Nicky after Agatha decided it would be best to move into Rio’s room. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha tried not to rub her relationship with Rio in Maria’s  face, they weren’t necessarily hiding it, just being considerate since Maria was still sensitive about her own relationship with Melinda crumbling to pieces. Agatha couldn’t help but feel somewhat responsible for Maria being dragged into her mess. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Also, Maria may have walked in on them more than once where Rio would be all over Agatha or where Agatha’s hands and lips were all over Rio. The last time Rio’s hand was inching towards slipping into Agatha’s pants in the bathroom, Maria walked in looking for her toothbrush and Agatha nearly died of embarrassment when she cleared her throat behind them.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>To keep things seemingly normal, preparations were being made for Thanksgiving, since they would be spending it together in the safe house. Since she couldn’t leave the safe house, Agatha sent Alice a long list of things to buy for the dinner they had planned. Agatha also begged Lilia to bake her famous pie, which was Agatha’s favorite when she was little.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>For Nicky, and all their sakes actually, Agatha wanted this Thanksgiving to be as normal as possible even with the addition of the special agents lurking on the property.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mom, are we going to the parade tomorrow?” Nicky asked excitedly at the breakfast table. They went every year, and Nicky being the biggest dress up fan Agatha knew, apart from Rio of course, was excited to get to wear his turkey costume to the parade again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Maria shared a pained look, “Not this year baby, we’re spending Thanksgiving here, at Lilia’s.” Agatha said, patting his head apologetically.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What?” Nicky moaned. “We always go to the parade!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nic, it’ll be just as fun right here okay, listen to your mother.” Maria said. “The parade will be there again next year.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky looked devastated, even Rio made a face feeling equally guilty at his disappointment. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey, bud, we can have our own Thanksgiving fun here?” Rio suggested. “Maybe we can ask Gerald to pull out the horse and carriages, or something. I’ll even let you beat me at Mario kart?” She winked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky’s face lifted slightly and he shrugged his shoulders with a small smile. “Oh that’s okay, Rio. It’s… whatever.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha squeezed Rio’s leg under the table and smiled at her apologetically. Rio was trying. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Everyone knew what was going on except Nicky. All he knew was that for some reason, his new blended family were on some weird overprotective and patrolled family holiday with Alice and the police visiting almost every day. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky,” Agatha said softly, “I promise we’ll still have fun, okay.” Nicky simply nodded his head and Agatha’s heart almost shattered. Agatha hated disappointing her son but there was no way she would put him in any more danger than he already was. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha's heart ached as she watched Nicky stand up from the table and slump towards the living room. She hung her head in her hands to hide her tears. Luckily everyone understood and Maria moved to console their son while Lilia also excused herself to return to her study.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s hand was stroking Agatha’s back in soft, comforting circles, “He’ll be okay, Ags. He doesn’t understand, but we will try to make tomorrow as exciting as possible for him. We’ll get through this.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you, Rio.” Agatha said softly, leaning her head against Rio’s chest. “I just want this shit to be over, </span>
<em>
<span>fuck</span>
</em>
<span>.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too, my love.” Rio said, kissing the top of her head.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>**************</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha retreated to the kitchen to start with preparations for the next day’s Thanksgiving dinner. She wasn’t the best cook, but over the years she managed to learn a few tricks by watching countless hours of cooking shows when she was alone after her divorce. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Previous years, Maria would cook the turkey, Agatha was more of a side dish chef, so to keep her promise of having the perfect dinner for Nicky, she was determined to make all his favorites, leaving the big bird to Maria. The distraction of cooking would help them both, she thought.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I hate that we are stuck here,” Agatha said while peeling the potatoes. She had her back turned to Maria who was boiling some broth on the stove for the turkey. “Nicky was so excited for the parade.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah,” Maria answered, “What can we do, Ags. If we go…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, it’s not safe.” Agatha said sharply. After a few minutes of silent chopping and peeling Agatha put down the knife. “Thanks, Maria. For helping and for… understanding, I guess.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m not going to lie about the fact that I hate this.” Maria said, turning to Agatha. “I never imagined my life would blow up like this. Twice now, actually.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed dryly. The situation was shit and she knew it. “Maria, I… you know this isn’t a reflection of you right? None of this is. I know </span>
<em>
<span>we </span>
</em>
<span>didn’t work out but it was never your fault and Melinda, well, I think she loved you in her own way.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria looked at Agatha like she didn’t believe a word she said. “I’m still here, alone, Agatha. If she… if it was real, we would be planning the next step in our relationship, not who get’s the fucking couch when she inevitably moves out or disappears.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha looked down at her hands and wrung the washcloth between them in thought.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Before this,” Maria continued, “We were planning on having a kid.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head snapped up and she saw the hurt in Maria’s tearful eyes. “I’m sorry Maria.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Better now, than later.” Maria smiled. Her smile never reached her eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria shook her head, trying to rid her mind of what she had lost and turned back to the stove. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>There was nothing Agatha could have said that would make the situation better. Maria was truly hurt and she couldn’t blame her at all. She probably felt like a small chess piece in Agatha’s complicated life. One without any real purpose other than being a way for Ralph to get closer to getting Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>From somewhere in the house Rio and Nicky’s loud giggles broke through the silence in the kitchen. Agatha smiled to herself, she loved that Rio and Nicky got along so well. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“He seems to really like her.” Maria laughed quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, she’s a lot like him actually.” Agatha laughed, “When they start talking about some game ot whatever my brain just fogs over.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m glad you two have her. She… fits.” Maria smiled, “And you really look happy.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I am.” Agatha admitted. “Obviously, under different circumstances this would be perfect.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“At least you’ll have a great story to tell.” Maria laughed. “Mine will be tragic, but it might score me some sympathy points if I ever decide to date again.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Come, now. You’re a catch.” Agatha teased.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hmmm, a divorced and scammed small town lesbian mother… Not really the best biography for my dating profile.” Maria joked. “Desperate people will turn me away.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her lips together. “You deserve happiness, Maria, just give it some time.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky and Rio sat nailed to the TV screen in the living room. Their fingers buzzed over the controls of the PlayStation and when Nicky beat Rio for the fourth time she threw her hands up in defeat. “That’s it, I am calling your mom! You are definitely cheating, kid!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No way Rio, you are just taking the turns too fast.” Nicky explained like a little expert. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>They have been playing Grand Turismo for the last two hours and Nicky was clearly much more practiced than Rio was. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Can’t believe I am losing to a little twig like you.” Rio joked, bumping her shoulder against his.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s all in the wrist. Wanna go again.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Bring it on little man.” Rio said picking up the controller again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Their cars lined up at the starting line and they watched the countdown. At the word “GO” both leaned forward in concentration. Rio pressed the button like her life depended on it, she wasn’t letting him win again. “Come on.” she muttered as she heard Nicky giggle next to her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Here comes the corner. Slack a bit, turn, then bolt it.” Nicky advised her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes, but smiled, determined to make the corner without spinning out again. “I did it!” she yelled, triumphantly and leaned forward again to concentrate on the road ahead.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ve got it!” Nicky cheered, “Next corner is a hairpin…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Urgh no!” Rio yelled, as she watched her car spin out again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky laughed with a cheeky grin, “Sorry Rio, you got schooled again.” he sung.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio huffed a breath and smirked at Nicky, “One day... One day I will beat you and you will be sorry…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You two having fun?” Agatha asked, plopping down on the sofa next to Rio, still licking her wounds from losing, again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Your son is a cheater.” Rio winked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Am not!” Nicky defended. “Rio just sucks at taking corners.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I do not </span>
<em>
<span>suck…</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nicky pressed his lips together, and Rio could have swore she had seen the exact same expression on Agatha’s face before. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You just need to practice,” Nicky flicked his wrists, another similar gesture to his mother’s, “It’s all in the wrists.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio rolled her eyes and laughed. “Geez, you two are like carbon copies of each other.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Nicky both smirked similarly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“There! See!” Rio exclaimed. “God, it’s enough getting it from one, but two of you, that hardly seems fair.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed and took Rio’s hand gently, “What did they say about apples…?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, you two took that to heart.” Rio smiled. “Okay Nicky, is there anything you suck at? I need to beat you at </span>
<em>
<span>something</span>
</em>
<span> before the end of this week.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No not really, I excel at most things actually.” he answered smugly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Pfft, how old are you again?” Rio joked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Seven, going on twenty seven.” Agatha joked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*************** </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Later that night when most of the house had retreated to their rooms, Rio was helping Agatha clean up in the kitchen. Most of the food for the next day was prepared or ready to be baked or warmed up again for the big dinner. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was humming something to herself while she was drying off the last of the dishes and Rio felt her whole heart sigh at the sight. She was down bad, whipped, ruined. Whatever the right words were for being absolutely and completely in love with Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Since being in lock down in the safe house they spent almost every minute of the last week together and something shifted in their relationship. Rio could feel her life opening up entirely for Agatha. For her to take up the space in her heart that belonged to her and her only. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio couldn’t imagine a life away from her or without her anymore, so when the email she received from her boss came through earlier that morning about her annual leave being denied, she responded without hesitation. She quit, effective immediately. Was it impulsive, sure. Did her parents warn her about making impulsive life altering decisions on a whim before, yup. And was it worth it to give up everything for love, for Agatha, no fucking doubt. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio already had a plan. One that she had secretly been dreaming of for years. Something that was just hers, and if Agatha would have her, that plan would be executed right here in Westview or wherever Agatha was.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I have some, slightly big news.” Rio said suddenly, turning around to face Agatha, who almost dropped the bowl she was drying off.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Shit Rio, I almost dropped this.” Agatha said with wide eyes.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Sorry,” Rio laughed. She walked up to Agatha and took the bowl from her hands and placed it down on the counter next to them. She spun her around and held her by her hips, kissing her sweetly before taking a small step back, but still holding on to her hips..</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“So what is this </span>
<em>
<span>slightly big</span>
</em>
<span> news that almost cost Lilia a mixing bowl?” Agatha asked, resting her arms on Rio’s shoulders.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m leaving Philly.” Rio said simply.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Leaving Phlilly? What do you mean, where will you go?” Agatha asked. Her face was riddled with nerves.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I have been thinking about this for a while now, to start up my own thing, and so I quit my job today.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You quit your job? Rio, what…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll probably have to go back to pack up my things and so on, but… Agatha, I really meant it when I said that I loved you, </span>
<em>
<span>love you</span>
</em>
<span>, and this week, spending time with you and Nicky, it made me realize that I really want this. All of this, and if I am really honest with myself, I have been waiting for a reason to leave there anyway. I loved my job and my apartment and the city but really that was someone else’s life I was living. I’ve always wanted something that was mine, that I built from the ground up, and I can do that anywhere.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took Agatha’s hands in hers and stared at their intertwined fingers for a brief moment. She smiled warmly and met Agatha’s bright blue eyes again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess what I am saying, what I am asking, is if you would want </span>
<em>
<span>anywhere</span>
</em>
<span> to be here, with you.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you mean…” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“If you’ll have me, I would really love it if we…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Move in with me!” Agatha interrupted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well yes, that was… I was getting to that.” Rio laughed. “I want to build something real with you Agatha. I don’t want you to think that when all this crazy shit is over that I’ll leave and go back to my old life, because truly, that was a placeholder for what I really want. And that is you. A life with you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Before Rio could really finish her unprepared confession, Agatha’s body was pressed up tightly on hers, pressing her up against the kitchen counter and kissing her fervently. Rio blinked and eventually settled into the kiss and wrapped Agatha up in her arms, allowing the kiss to deepen. Agatha was cupping her face and bruising her lips against Rio’s. Rio was sure their lips would be swollen when they parted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pulled back slightly, and Rio instantly chased after her lips at the loss. “So you’re not mad?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed and Rio swore she saw a star flicker in her blue eyes, “Mad? Rio, you have no idea how happy this makes me.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Really?” Rio asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes you idiot, I fucking love you. I think if I am honest, I think I always have.” Agatha admitted, her voice was a low whisper. “I may have had it buried below years of fear and trauma, feeling like a lost cause really, but since I’ve had you back in my life, I know now. It was always you. I was waiting, for </span>
<em>
<span>you.</span>
</em>
<span>”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s heart swelled and her eyes were rimmed with unshed tears, “Fuck, I love you so much. I am so happy I found you after all these years.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Me too.” Agatha said, closing the distance between them again with a searing kiss. “Let’s go to bed, I need to hold you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt a burning heat roll from her heart to somewhere low in her stomach, “Lead the way, beautiful.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>***************</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Later that night under the cover of darkness, a figure lurked from over the boundary wall of the safe house estate, where a dark pair of eyes stood glaring through a set of binoculars, watching the last light in the house turn off. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“They're down for the night. Over.” the scruffy voice said over the two way radio. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t move until I say you do.” Another voice answered. “The boss just wants the lady. No one else. Clear?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yup, locate, extract and deliver. Got it. Over.”</span>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It was the dead of night when Rio woke up suddenly. Whatever woke her went silent again, it may have been her imagination, but she has always been a good sleeper, so whatever it was, was loud enough to wake her. Feeling strangely disorientated, she felt around in the bed next to her where Agatha should be. Nothing. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio bolted upright and immediately flipped on the bed lamp in a panic. The bed next to her was empty and Agatha was nowhere to be seen.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio jumped out of the bed and checked the en-suite bathroom to see if she was there but the room was empty. Something just felt wrong, she could feel it in her bones.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio swung open the door to their bedroom. She heard a clutter coming from downstairs and practically sprinted to where the sound was coming from. In her hurry, she passed a mantle and grabbed the first heavy thing she could get her hands on to use as a weapon, should it be necessary.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Turning the corner carefully she saw a shadow moving in the threshold of the dining room and approached it slowly, holding the heavy candlestick above her head in anticipation. Now was not the time to be a coward, Rio thought to herself as she squeezed her eyes shut and took a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio jumped around the corner, “Ah-ha!” she yelled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Jesus, fuck! </span>
<em>
<span>Rio!</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha yelled, holding her chest and gasping for air. Rio’s eyes shot open and she dropped the candle stick with a loud thud on the wooden floor of the dining room. “What the fuck are you doing?” Agatha asked, picking up the candle stick and holding onto it tightly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio finally asked when her breathing stabilized. “It’s the middle of the fucking night and you are…” Rio looked around the room to the strings of unfinished handmade paper decorations lying on the table. “Wait, are you decorating?” </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I wanted to surprise Nicky with it on Thanksgiving.” Agatha said, straightening her back. “It’s stupid, I know, but we used to make these hand shaped turkeys together… just this thing we did and then we would go to the parade… I just thought that if I could do something, decorate, or whatever.” Rio watched Agatha’s eyes fill with tears. “He was so disappointed.” Agatha said, crying softly. “But what are you doing, barging in like this with… is that what your weapon of choice would be?” Agatha said pointing to the heavy candlestick.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I just grabbed what I could get.” Rio felt like a moron for acting like Agatha’s knight in shining armour, candlestick in hand and all. “You could have told me, I could have helped.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pressed her lips together and smiled tearily at Rio. “It’s fine, I just couldn’t sleep.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You scared the hell out of me Ags.” Rio smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And you nearly killed me. Miss Vidal, with a heart attack, in the dining room.” Agatha joked, finally laughing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Come back to bed? I’ll help you set up everything tomorrow morning. I’m sure Nicky will love it.” Rio said, walking up to Agatha and taking her hands in hers.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I will, in a bit. Let me just finish up this string.” Agatha said, lifting the string of hand shaped turkeys from the table. “This is the last one.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed softly and kissed Agatha’s cheek. “Don’t be long, tomorrow is a big day.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded and kissed Rio back. “I’ll be there soon. I love you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled and turned to walk back to their bedroom, reminding herself to walk instead of floating forward as Agatha’s words spun around in her head. </span>
<em>
<span>“I love you. I love you. I love you.”</span>
</em>
<span> she’d never get enough of hearing that.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha drew a beak on the last two hand shaped turkeys and punched the holes for the strings to go through. She laughed at herself, this was so silly, but Nicky would love it and she’d do anything to cheer him up at this point.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha heard a door open and close somewhere in the house, deciding that she should probably head back to bed with Rio. Agatha folded the paper decorations and cleaned the paper snippings up and flipped the switch to turn off the light of the dining room. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The dark passage to the staircase felt strange but Agatha shook off the chilled feeling, the lack of sleep was probably finally getting to her. Agatha turned the corner to start climbing up the stairs when a shadow caught her eyes. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio?” She called out in the dark. No answer.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This isn’t funny, babe.” Agatha said with a shaky voice, Rio’s earlier antics with the candlestick was one thing but lurking in the dark…</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Suddenly a hand gripped her shoulder from behind and another cupped her mouth. Agatha bit the hand and strained her neck to yell out, “No!” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The hand slapped back over her mouth and Agatha bent forward to pull away from the body around her. In the commotion she kicked over a large vase and it shattered all over the floor. “Help!” She yelled out, but before she could yell and fight back she felt a thud against her head and her eyes fell into darkness. Somewhere far away she heard Rio’s voice call her name before everything faded away.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>************</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The house was in utter chaos as a flurry of uniformed and plain clothed officers and agents swarmed the house. Rio sat frozen at the dining table staring at the stack of hand shaped turkeys Agatha had made only a few hours ago, before her world came crashing down on her. Through deadset eyes, she watched as everyone blurred around her, yelling over cellphones and two way radios. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>An agent who’s name she didn’t remember was sitting across from her trying to get the details of what happened when they took Agatha. Rio saw every detail replay over and over in her head.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After leaving Agatha in the dining room Rio walked back up the stairs to their bedroom. She had kept the door open, waiting for Agatha to return. Not wanting to fall asleep without knowing Agatha was back in bed next to her, she stayed awake and that was when she heard it. The switch of the light turning off, the door opening and closing. What door was it? She didn’t know. The faint sounds of a scuffle then the muffled calls from the staircase. Finally, a word yelled out, “</span>
<em>
<span>Help!”</span>
</em>
<span>, after the clamor of a broken vase. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio had run to the noise only to see the dark dressed figure carry Agatha’s protesting body out of the front door and into a van. Black. Indistinct. No number plates. No badges, decals, nothing. Only leaving behind a set of generic tire tracks, and a small spatter of blood in the foyer. Probably Agatha’s.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Look, I didn’t see the guy.” Rio said again, leaning forward with her hands in her hair. “You should be out there looking for her. Not here, asking me the same fucking questions over and over again.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>”Ma’am, we are looking for her, I promise, but the more information we can get the quicker we will be able to find her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed, she knew this. She just didn’t know anything more to tell them. “What about Melinda? She was working with them, she knew about the safe house. It was her.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We already have someone talking to her.” The agent said. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And Evanora? She’s behind this.” Rio yelled frustrated.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s give her some space,” Alice said from the doorway. Rio was relieved to see her, finally a face she trusted that could make sure that they bring Agatha back in one piece.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice,” Rio said standing up, “Anything?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice rested her hand on Rio’s arm, “We’ll find her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>*********</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head was killing her as she blinked open her eyes to a sharp light hanging over her. She didn’t recognize the room she was in and she pulled up her nose at the moldy stench hanging in the room. In the corner, a worn brown sofa stood next to small coffee table with a glass of water and a plate of what looked like a dried up sandwich.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>This was a weird fucking dream, Agatha thought to herself. Only this wasn’t a dream, because if it were her head would not be throbbing the way it was now. Agatha moved to get up from the floor and to see if she could look out of the small window of the room. Her legs wobbled slightly under her weight but she managed to get up to the window in one piece.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She seemed to be in some sort of basement, she thought. From the small window she saw a shed and the back of a car she didn’t recognize. Agatha tried to open the window but it was locked or welded shut. “</span>
<em>
<span>Fuck!”</span>
</em>
<span> she yelled out as she slumped against the wall and slid to the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Immediately she remembered what day it was, Thanksgiving. Nicky’s favorite holiday, now definitely ruined forever. If she had just been strong enough to fight off her assailant. Agatha thought back to Dottie’s neighborhood watch self protection class Agatha was pulled into. At the time Agatha and Alice joined in reluctantly, laughing and making fun to get through the hour. She should have taken it way more seriously because look at the shitshow of a situation she was in now. Maybe the housewife karate would have been handy.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat with her hands in her hair thinking and feeling the lump forming at the side where the asshole knocked her unconscious. If they were going to kill her, she would be dead already, her lifeless body would be lying in a pool of her own blood somewhere in the safehouse, but no, here she was, still alive. This didn’t make sense. They were keeping her alive for some reason. Ralph didn’t have any reason to keep her alive unless they needed her for something.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>But for what and for how long?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A noise startled her coming from the door at the top of the basement stairs. Someone was unlocking it. Agatha got up and moved to the corner, looking around for anything to defend herself with. She grabbed the glass of water and held it tightly, she could smash the glass against the wall and use a shard of glass if needed. Stupid fucking idea, but the room was empty other than the smelly sofa and the old sandwich which did not look like something she would be eating any time soon.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The door creaked open and two sets of heavy shoes descended down the staircase. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A man she didn’t recognize lead down the stairs and when Agatha lifted her eyes to the two people her heart dropped. Evanora.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mother. Fuck, of course.” Agatha spat, shaking her head. Her silent tears rolled down her face. No surprise that this fucking devil of a woman was behind all of it. “Long time no see.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t get smart with me Agnes. You know I don’t like that tone.” Evanora said harshly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You could have called.” Agatha smiled sarcastically.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s cut to the chase, sweetheart.” Evanora said. “You caused a lot of trouble with your statement, putting an innocent man in jail.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed dryly, “Innocent? I saw him shoot and kill those men, mother. He was far from innocent.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You have always been a terrible liar my dear.” Evanora grinned. “And now the time has come for you to tell the truth. The whole truth, so help you God. For your sake and </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha Harkness’</span>
</em>
<span> sake.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The truth? What is this?” Agatha watched as the man accompanying her mother set up a tripod with a camera attached on top in front of the sofa. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Your one and only chance, my dear. To tell the whole world the truth and to tell them what a dirty little liar you are. How you made up the whole story to get some much needed attention, you know, mommy or daddy issues, whomever you need to blame. You see, my old client was innocent, and because of your dirty mouth and obvious desperate need for attention, he has spent the last decade behind bars, atoning for someone else’s crimes.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s mouth hung open in awe. “You can’t be serious.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh I am. Dead serious. The newly found evidence will show that everything was planted, and that you were coaxed into delivering a false statement, perjury is a punishable offence, dear. A felony in the state of Pennsylvania, and I am willing to ask the judge for the maximum sentence for a crime of this magnitude. What that poor man had to endure behind bars… you should be ashamed of yourself.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I won’t…” Agatha spat. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh you will, and you will make it very believable. I didn’t pay for those silly drama lessons for nothing. We both know can be quite the actress if you actually tried. You managed to keep up the act of Agatha Harkness for ten years didn’t you, the Oscars never saw you coming, my dear.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And if I don’t? What then? You’ll just kill me?” Agatha frowned.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh no, never. I am not a murderer. I will however let you suffer your own consequences. Or should I say, let </span>
<em>
<span>them </span>
</em>
<span>suffer </span>
<em>
<span>your</span>
</em>
<span> consequences.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Them?” Agatha asked nervously.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicholas Harkness. Rio Vidal. Ring a bell?” Evanora chuckled to herself. “To name a few.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You wouldn’t.” Agatha said, launching herself at her mother.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora didn’t move an inch, “Oh, would you like to test me? We got to you pretty easily, despite the whole army marching around that old hag’s barn. Lilia was never a subtle woman. That house practically screamed </span>
<em>
<span>safehouse.</span>
</em>
<span> Now if you would be so kind as to join me on the sofa for your live apology.” </span>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Sitting around and waiting for any news felt like waiting for the end of the world to come. Rio was restless and poor Nicky was inconsolable. The news of his mother’s kidnapping hit him like a punch to the gut. Luckily, he had a small army of loved ones around him to keep his spirits up.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried to distract him with more PlayStation game challenges, but her heart wasn’t in it. She felt paralyzed with guilt for not being able to get to her on time and the fear of never seeing her again was ripping a hole straight through her heart.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The amount of agents and officers in the house wasn’t helping either. It seemed everyone was looking busy but no results came of it. No one knew where to even start with tracking her down.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>With the Thanksgiving dinner now forgotten, Rio and Nicky sat on the floor in the living room with the television’s sound turned down to a quiet murmur. Maria, sitting on the sofa near them, was attentively keeping an eye on the news bulletins as they came up, while Rio was teaching Nicky a card game to keep him distracted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh fuck,” Maria yelled out. Rio’s head snapped up immediately. “It’s her. It’s Agatha!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria turned up the volume on the television as Alice and Lilia ran into the living room.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“We have received news of a live video feed sent to us via an encrypted source. This seems to be related to the missing Westview woman, Agatha Harkness, who disappeared from safe custody earlier this morning.” </span>
</em>
<span>The talking head reported.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>From where Rio was sitting, her eyes were instantly glued to the screen as she dropped the pack of cards, jumping up from her seat on the floor.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The news channel switched over to the live feed where a dim room came into frame. There she saw her. Agatha, sitting in front of a camera, wide eyed and nervous. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Mama!” Nicky yelled. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky, come with me.” Maria said, pulling at his arm to take him out of the room. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“But its…” Nicky cried.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nic, baby please. Let the police do their work. Come with me outside, I will explain everything later, okay?” Maria said, pulling him out of the view from the television.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio watched as Nicky reluctantly left with his other mother and turned back to the television. Agatha looked fine, well alive at least, but her eyes were red from obviously crying. Rio wished she could reach through the screen to grab her and never let her go.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After the camera in front of Agatha settled, she took a shaky breath. </span>
<em>
<span>“My name is Ag… Agnes O’Connor, currently known as Agatha Harkness. I testified under oath in court that I witnessed a crime, a murder, ten years ago in Philadelphia.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped her head and ran her hands through her hair. Rio took a step closer to the television. “Is this… can they trace this…” she asked before turning back to the TV.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“My testimony…”</span>
</em>
<span> Agatha continued, interrupting Rio’s questioning to the agents in the room. </span>
<em>
<span>“My testimony resulted in the guilty verdict of Mr. Ralph Bohner.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the tears roll over her face as she saw Agatha visibly fighting every word coming out of her mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“I am here today to…” </span>
</em>
<span>she cleared her throat and shook her head, looking up at nothing to hide the fact that she was crying. </span>
<em>
<span>“...to set the record straight that I… that I…” </span>
</em>
<span>Agatha bit her lip and smiled a wicked teary smile. </span>
<em>
<span>“...I was forced to confess… THAT I HAVE BEEN KIDNAPPED BY MY MOTHER AND I AM NOW BEING BLACKMAILED TO RETRACT…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The screen went dark.</span>
<em>
<span> </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, </span>
<em>
<span>NO!</span>
</em>
<span>” Rio cried as the woman she loved with all her heart disappeared from the screen in front of her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The dark screen flickered back to the news anchors. </span>
<em>
<span>“Our producers have sent this footage and all other information to the authorities to help find the kidnapped woman…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice turned off the television and the room went silent. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice. What do we do?” Rio asked, no, pleaded.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This is good Rio, trust me.” Alice said, hugging her. “They need her and this shows they are desperate. We can work with this.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stood thinking for a second. “Lilia, your firm handled the RB case right?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, well Evanora did.” Lilia answered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What if we could bait them somehow? Fool them to think that we will give up something that might clear his name or something.” Alice asked, turning Lilia.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Not after </span>
<em>
<span>that</span>
</em>
<span>?” Rio interrupted them, “Not after what she just did… She just blew up their plan…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Evanora needs this, if she could clear his name somehow, it gets her off the hook too. We’ll have to be smart about this, Evanora is smart. She definitely has some judge in her pocket to be able to get the testimony thrown out.” Lilia spoke so surely, Rio almost felt relieved, but she couldn’t help the gnawing feeling that they were naive to think that they wouldn’t hurt Agatha.  </span>

<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That was fucking stupid,” Evanora snarled, slapping her cheek. “Did you think I was joking when I said I would get to them? Your </span>
<em>
<span>family</span>
</em>
<span>?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed her face as it stung from her mother’s hand, she knew she fucked up by pulling that stunt, but she had to take the risk. She needed to fight, to get out of this alive and to get back to Nicky and Rio, but giving in to her mother was never going to happen.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You rotten child.” Evanora spat, walking away frustratedly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What are you going to do to me?” Agatha asked, taunting and genuinely curious. “I’m still your daughter, could you really be this cruel?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Cruel?” Evanora said sharply, “I gave you everything. You were too weak to rise up to any of my expectations. You could have been great, but you are just like your pathetic father.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just because I didn’t want to be a fucking shark like you, I am pathetic? Please mother…” Agatha huffed, “You seek power and cling on to anyone with money, no matter which side of right or wrong they are on. I may not be some big shot lawyer with a dirty conscience or an offshore bank account, but I have </span>
<em>
<span>real</span>
</em>
<span> friends and people who love me and care for me. Who do you have, mother?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha saw her mother seething at her words. She hit a nerve and that was as clear as day and she was now playing a dangerous game. She has never stood up to her mother, not like this, and especially not with someone else’s lives on the line.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora let out a deep evil chuckle. “My girl, do you think I care about that? About you? You are greatly mistaken. I </span>
<em>
<span>tolerated</span>
</em>
<span> you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt the pang in her chest. This wasn’t new, her mother’s rejection of her, but living without it for the last ten years helped heal that part of her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Her mother walked up towards the door of the basement, turning around one last time before leaving.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s see how obedient you are tomorrow. Sweet dreams, my dear.” She bolted the door behind her and Agatha slumped into the sofa below her. Her tears finally caught up with her and she sobbed into her hands. How did she get in this mess, and how the hell will she get out of it?</span>

<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha woke up on the uncomfortable sofa with an ache in her neck from being bundled up to keep warm. Sometime during the night it started snowing and the one musty blanket they threw down at her last night was barely enough to keep her from freezing. Agatha also needed to pee, like badly and she was not going to use the bucket they gave her. She might be a hostage, but she still had her fucking standards.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Trying her luck one last time, Agatha pulled the blanket around her shoulders and shuffled to the small window in the basement, pushing and pulling to see if it had any budge at all, but nothing, the only thing she felt was the cold from the thin sheen of snow coating the window sill. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Another look at the bent bucket in the corner made her stomach turn, but it also gave her an idea. She dropped the blanket where she stood and climbed up the stairs to the door of the basement, and started banging on the door for them to open. If her plan had any chance of working, it was worth a chance, she thought before slamming her fists on the wood again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey!” she yelled, “I need the bathroom you assholes!” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Nothing. She tried again. “Please!” she pleaded dramatically. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually, after increasing the force and intensity of her banging on the door, it creaked opened.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you want?” the scruffy voiced man grumbled through a small crack in the door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hoped with all her might that this dumbass would fall for her antics.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please… sir.” she asked, batting her eyes in exaggeration. “I </span>
<em>
<span>really</span>
</em>
<span> need to use the bathroom. The real one. Don’t get me wrong, I love and appreciate the bucket, but it’s not really ideal for… </span>
<em>
<span>lady things.” </span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The man’s eyes widened in panic as he realized what she meant. Got him, she thought. It was the 21th century and men still panicked at the mention of a fucking period. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“If I promise to behave, can I please use the bathroom in the house?” Agatha pleaded with a big, bright, fake smile.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>He looked around for a moment, the doubt in his demeanor evident, but after another pained expression from Agatha while she awkwardly pointed to her uterus, he finally agreed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fine, but no funny business.” he grumbled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The door closed and Agatha heard the chain lock release from the other side of the door and it opened. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She held her hands up, “No funny business, I just need the bathroom.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The man grabbed her hands and held it behind her back as he walked her over to the bathroom. Agatha took the opportunity to see where she was. The house smelled funny, but it was empty, except for the two of them it seemed. The decor looked plain, more old brown and beige furniture, no pictures against the walls, temporary. This wasn’t someone’s house, this was a base, a temporary place to crash while on a job.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Here,” he said, pushing her inside. “Don’t try anything and be quick. The boss lady is on her way and I am not getting the whip over a tampon.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha smiled after straightening herself, as she stumbled forward, almost hitting the sink. When the door was closed she used the toilet while taking in her surroundings and the contents of the bathroom.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A small window with bars too narrow to climb out of. A bar of soap she would not be touching. A dirty towel hanging over the shower door. A mop. Bingo.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha quietly got up from the toilet after finishing up and took the mop, seeing if she could break it somehow. After trying to break it over her knee like she’s seen in the movies and failing horribly, she hooked the one end of the mop behind the pedestal of the sink and pulled the stick back like a big lever. Finally a crack and when it broke, she fell backwards against the door. “Fuck.” she whispered, rubbing her elbow where she hit the door.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey!” the man yelled, “What’s going on in there.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Just cleaning up. I slipped.” she barked. Looking down on the floor the broken mop stick made a decent weapon for now. It was more than she counted on finding anyway and the break in the middle of the stick had a nice sharp edge. She grabbed it and held it tightly behind her back as she stood up to get ready for the door to open. “I’m done.” she sang, too cheery to be believable.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha took a deep breath and the moment the door creaked open, she swung the stick at the man’s head, hitting him on the side of his ear. He stumbled backwards and grabbed at his head. “Fucking bitch!” he moaned.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha pushed him out of the way and started running to where she remembered the living room to be, but the unfamiliar layout of the house let man catch up with her. He caught the back of her shirt and tackled her to the ground with a hard thump.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt her breath get forced out of her chest as they fell to the ground. She struggled to get free and her stick fell to the side of her, just too far away to reach. The man was straddling her and holding her down while she flung her arms to hit him or to push him off of her. With a particularly strong swing of her arm, she hit him in the nose, hearing a soft crack. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She felt the pain sparking through her hand, but quickly deduced that it wasn’t from the bones in her hand cracking against his face, but from the punch cracking the cartilage in his nose as the blood started dripping from his face onto the front of her shirt. He cried in pain and lifted himself off of her slightly, allowing her to wiggle herself loose a bit more, just enough for her to be able to reach the end of her makeshift weapon. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Not wasting any more time, she tried to whack him with the stick again, this time with the sharper side of the stick. He was fighting back, but Agatha had enough. In that moment, she wasn’t just fighting to be free from under his weight, she was fighting for her son, for Rio. To see them again and to be able to hold them again. With added determination, she stuck it as hard as she could one final time, pegging the sharp end of the stick into the meat of his leg.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A loud cry echoed through the house as he fell over to the side holding onto his leg as the blood started gushing out of the wound. Agatha scrambled to get up, stepping as far away from him as she could. She had to get away now. She scanned the room quickly, looking for something to use as another weapon, in case he got up again. On the kitchen counter she saw a small pocket knife and ran to grab it, opening it up as soon as she put her hands on it. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She turned to run to the front door and saw the man pushing himself up off the floor. “Back the fuck off!” she yelled at him, holding the pocket knife up in front of her as he stumbled towards her, the stick still protruding from his thigh. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’ll pay for this, you bitch,” he said, launching himself at her, but his foot caught on the chair next to him and he fell face first against the kitchen cabinets, falling to the floor with a loud thud. He didn’t move. Agatha laughed in disbelief as she carefully kicked his body to see if he was awake but he seemed to be out cold, or dead, she didn’t mind either and wasted no more time to run to the front door of the house to get the hell out of there. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She opened the door and immediately felt the cold air cut through her. For a moment she thought to just make a run for it in the cold, but she knew she wouldn’t make it far in the pajamas she was wearing. Her eye caught a jacket hanging over a chair and she ran back to grab it. She pulled it on and bolted out of the door. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>As soon as the cold hit her in the face she stood still in her tracks, taking a deep breath. She wasn’t free yet, but this felt close. She just had to figure out where she was and how she would get back to her family. Agatha ran down the steps of the porch, her slippers were falling off her feet, but she simply pulled them back on and hit the road. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When she neared the end of the short driveway to the road, she saw a car approach in the distance. The car was definitely heading her way, she had to hide and fucking fast incase it was the </span>
<em>
<span>boss lady,</span>
</em>
<span> Evanora coming back for another round of verbal torture. Who knew what she was capable of these days, and now that Agatha was trying to escape, she will definitely be furious. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha huddled behind a bunch of barrels just off the road in time to hear the car pull into the driveway of the house she escaped from. She could peek through a small opening between two of the barrels and her suspicions were confirmed. Evanora and two other men she couldn’t yet recognize. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A man in a long black coat followed behind Evanora as she walked up to the house while the driver of the car leaned on the side of the car, lighting a cigarette. Evanora stopped when she saw the door standing ajar, and turned to say something to the man behind her. He turned and Agatha ducked back down to hide, but not before she saw his face, it was Ralph fucking Bohner.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Fuck. Agatha’s heart thumped in her chest, she had to get away and now was her only chance. If Ralph found her, he’d kill her, she was sure of it. Agatha squeezed her eyes shut, she had to be brave, she had to survive this. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was freezing, only wearing the stolen jacket over her pajamas and her flimsy slippers to cover her feet. They would soon discover the injured guy inside the house and the empty basement, but she couldn’t risk running down the road with the guy leaning against the car, that would definitely be too obvious, she would be a sitting, or running duck, and she has never really been the athletic type.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hunched back down to figure out a plan. The driver probably had the keys to the car in his pockets or if she was lucky they’d still be in the car’s ignition. Agatha held onto the small pocket knife she forgot she took from the kitchen and looked through the barrels, scanning the area again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just then she heard the front door of the house swing open. “Where the </span>
<em>
<span>hell</span>
</em>
<span> did she go?” Evanora yelled at the driver. “Find her and bring her back. Now!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The driver flicked his cigarette to the side as Agatha peeked through the barrels, watching Evanora storm off back into the house. The driver started to look for her around the side of the house. It would only be a matter of time before he found her where she was hiding. She looked down at the small pocket knife. </span>
<em>
<span>It will have to do</span>
</em>
<span>, she thought.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha watched the driver of the car disappear around the corner of the house and ran to the driver’s side of the car. It was locked, no keys in sight. She heard the man shuffle somewhere close to her and hurried to hide behind the car. The driver returned back towards the car, walking slowly, kicking the dirt in boredom as he walked, obviously not the most enthusiastic goon Evanora could have hired.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>He stopped next to the car to light up another cigarette. Agatha could smell the smoky sweat coming from his coat from how close she was to him. It was now or never. She held her breath as he looked around superficially. Agatha opened the small pocket knife in her hands. She’s only seen this move in movies, where the person’s heel would be sliced to incapacitate them. Would that even work, like where should she cut? </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>No, she wasn’t some trained fucking secret agent, but she was desperate enough. Not thinking about it too much, she jumped up and plunged the knife into the side of the man’s neck. He turned to her with wide eyes and grabbed at his neck while he stumbled backwards. Agatha froze in place as she watched him fall onto his back, bleeding out. She probably killed him. Fuck. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“</span>
<em>
<span>Two down</span>
</em>
<span>…” her inappropriately timed thoughts whispered. This wasn’t time to think of her headcount now. Agatha spared no more time and ran towards the body, digging though his pockets for the keys to the car. She patted him down as quickly as possible while keeping an eye on the front door and the side of the house. She couldn’t take the chance of Evanora or Ralph spotting her. She wouldn’t be captured again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The deep side pocket of his coat revealed a set of keys with a smiling devil emoji keychain. “Fitting, mother.” she mumbled to herself and pressed the key remote to unlock the car. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just as she was about to fumble the key into the ignition, Evanora and Ralph burst through the front door. Agatha locked eyes with her mother as Ralph started running to the car. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fucking </span>
<em>
<span>start</span>
</em>
<span>!” Agatha yelled as she turned the key. Ralph tried to pull the door open but it was locked luckily and on the third turn of the key the car finally started just as he started banging against the window to break it.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Without any more hesitation or even a look in the rear view mirror Agatha slammed her foot on the pedal and pulled off in reverse, hitting the barrels that kept her hidden earlier. She lost her fucks a while ago, “Not my car, not my problem.” Agatha laughed as she sped away, leaving a cloud of dust in her rearview mirror. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stole a quick look behind her watching as Ralph ran out into the street behind her. She finally got away, now she only needed to find out where the hell she was and how she was getting home to her family.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It has now been almost one day, 15 hours and 53 minutes since Agatha was kidnapped from the safe house. In Rio’s mind, it has probably been one day, 15 hours and 48 minutes since she was too late to stop the kidnappers from getting away with the love of her life. She still hated herself for not being able to stop them from dragging and shoving Agatha’s limp body into the back of the black van they came in.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>To make matters even worse, the news footage of the live stream replayed on each and every screen in the house it seemed, taunting her and reminding her of the fact that she may have lost her. Every time she watched it replay on the news it ended the same, no matter how hard she wished for another ending, it always ended with Agatha smiling and obviously crying, yelling into the camera only to disappear as the screen blacked-out. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tried very hard to not imagine what would happen to Agatha after the black out, after the camera was turned off. Agatha obviously didn’t follow her captor's orders, she’s Agatha, when would she ever, but what consequences did that stunt mean for her? Would they hurt her? Kill her? </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Evanora was Agatha’s mother, sure, but the more Rio learned about the woman, the more she realized that the woman was a mother in title only. A real mother wouldn’t put her own daughter through what she has put Agatha through. No real mother would be the spearhead of her own daughter’s capture and torture to help get a murderer’s charges dropped. No real mother would give her own daughter over to her killers for money.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Conclusion, Evanora wasn’t a real mother, she was a monster. A monster Rio hoped would be found and arrested and shoved into the deepest, darkest prison cells there was, before Rio could put her own hands on the woman. But really, Rio’s only hope was that they actually find Agatha and bring her back. The waiting was killing her and she could see the worry in all her friends’ faces.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Please Alice,” Rio sighed, dropping into the chair next to Alice where the agent was typing away on her laptop, “Tell me you guys are getting somewhere?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t tell you everything yet, but we may have located a house a few towns over that belonged to a relative of Evanora. We’re confirming the details for the warrant to search the property.” Alice answered in a hushed voice. “But Rio, you need to keep this to yourself. I’m not allowed to tell you anything about the case.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Who am I going to tell? I just want you guys to find her.” Rio pleaded. “How long does a warrant take?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ll probably get it by the end of the day. I’ve got the guys on standby at the station to head out there as soon as we can.” Alice whispered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Just then Alice’s phone rang and she got up to answer it away from Rio. Rio was left alone with Alice’s laptop and realized her opportunity. How long will Agatha be safe before the warrant is issued to search the house? Rio looked to see Alice still talking on her phone with her back turned to Rio, and Rio scrolled through Alice’s emails. She searched around and saw the location of the house. Bingo.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio took a photo of the laptop screen and hid her phone in her pocket as she got up and bolted out of the room to the living room where she remembered she saw Lilia’s car keys hanging on the key hooks on the wall. Everyone was too distracted to notice, so Rio grabbed the keys off the hook on the wall and snuck out to the garage. Inside the garage, Rio grabbed a crowbar from the racks on the side of the walls. She wasn’t good with a gun, but swinging a heavy metal rod at Ralph or Evanora sounded more doable. Rio pressed the button on the car keys and Lilia’s silver Mercedes came to life as the lights flickered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio climbed into the driver’s side and quickly entered the address she found on Alice’s laptop into her navigation app on her phone. The location was on a remote piece of land about two hours from Lilia’s safehouse. If the police got to Agatha first, she’d be right on their tails, but she was done waiting around. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m coming, my love.” Rio said, more to herself, but she hoped Agatha could feel her coming. Rio sped down the stone driveway and turned onto the main road, determined to save the woman her whole heart belonged to. </span>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grunted in frustration as she gripped the steering wheel tight, no matter how fast she tried to drive, she still felt she wasn’t getting to Agatha fast enough. She was already pushing the car well past the speed limit, just enough to still be able to have decent control over Lilia’s car. It wouldn’t be in anyone’s interest if she crashed on her way to try and save Agatha, now would it. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>What also didn’t help her building frustration was her fucking phone that kept on ringing and ringing. She knew exactly who it was but she hadn’t cared to answer out of pure spite. Alice and her team wasn’t getting anywhere and Rio decided to take matters into her own hands. After rejecting all four of Alice’s previous calls, Rio finally gave in and answered reluctantly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What, Alice?” Rio spat into the car speakers.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Rio, what the fuck…” </span>
</em>
<span>Alice yelled through the phone. Rio rolled her eyes. Seriously. Did they really think she would just sit around and wait for better days?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Alice…” Rio tried, sighing. There was no way Alice would be able to convince her to turn the car around. Not unless, by some miracle, they had Agatha safe at home before she could find her herself.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Please don’t be a fucking dumbass about this, Rio. You’re going to get yourself killed or hurt and Agatha…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“That’s </span>
<em>
<span>why</span>
</em>
<span> I am doing this Alice, for Agatha. I’m sick and tired of sitting around and hearing the same excuses over and over, that you’ll find her, that you’re </span>
<em>
<span>so </span>
</em>
<span>close. I know where she is and unlike you and your </span>
<em>
<span>suits</span>
</em>
<span>, I don’t have to wait around for a fucking warrant before I can actually do something.” Rio yelled back. Rio rubbed at her temple as she leaned against the window.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Rio, you know no one can keep you or Agatha safe if you do this. Please, just come back to the safehouse and…”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And what, Alice? You’ll wait for the judge or the rescue team? I’m already a half an hour away from her, and where are your guys, huh? Still waiting for the thumbs up? Still waiting for their lift to pick them up? I’m done waiting, Alice. Agatha is done waiting to be saved.” Rio asked, trying her hardest not to actually scream into the car speakers.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Rio…” </span>
</em>
<span>Alice tried to reason with her but it fell on deaf ears.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I said I’m done waiting, Alice. She’s…” Rio felt the tears starting to pool in her eyes. “I love her.” Rio said quietly. Fuck, she had to keep it together if she was going to be any use to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The line went silent for a few seconds. Rio heard the cops in the background of Alice’s call murmuring in the silence.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice sighed audibly into the phone, </span>
<em>
<span>“Urgh, just… Just don’t do anything fucking stupid. Wait for us if you can, we just got the order to go ahead and our team is right behind you. Please Rio… we all care about her.” </span>
</em>
<span>Alice sounded defeated, but Rio heard the earnest concern in Alice’s voice. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She quickly squeezed her eyes shut and felt a tear roll down the side of her cheek. “I’m not letting her… or myself get hurt, I promise Alice… but I’m getting her out of there with or without you.” Rio said finally.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<em>
<span>“Just be safe and… good luck Rio.” </span>
</em>
<span>Alice said with a sigh, ending the call.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio threw her phone to the side and it hopped off the passenger seat and dropped to the floor of the car. She’ll worry about that later. She was being reckless and stupid, she knew this. She had no training in any physical combat, apart from the one time she almost broke her wrist on the punching bag at gym. She only had a fucking crowbar, a GPS location and all the love in her heart to save Agatha, it will have to be enough this time.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The sun setting low in the sky was annoying Rio the most. Not only was it shining in her eyes, she obviously didn’t have her sunglasses with her, but it was also reminding her of another hour that passed with Agatha still not safe in her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>What also added to her annoyance was the fact that she had to stop for fucking gas and that was a very fucking inconvenient red light flickering on the dashboard. What kind of safehouse doesn’t keep their car’s tank full? Rio sniffed a laugh at herself and her inner dialogue, as if she would know what the protocol of a practical and functioning safe house would be, but a loaded gun in the cubby and a full tank of gas sounded like good practice in general.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Far on the horizon, Rio spotted the lights for the gas station. The road felt too abandoned and she thanked the stars appearing in the darkening sky that it at least had a gas station on her way. Running out of gas on the way or on the run would fucking suck. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio pulled off the road and into the gas station, parking Lilia’s car in front of one of the gas pumps. These weren’t the self service pumps that she was used to, so she turned off the car and got out, waiting for the attendant to approach her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ma’am?” the man dressed in a thick branded jacket spoke.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hi,” Rio greeted, she opened her wallet and took out a $50 bill and handed it to the attendant who started filling up the fuel tank.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Where are you heading?” he asked her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Visiting a friend in the area.” she answered bluntly. This man didn’t need to know where she was going. He seemed uninterested in her answer anyway and continued filling up the fuel tank.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt the temperature dropping as the sun set further and shivered. She decided to rather wait in the car for the attendant to finish up.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“All done.” the man said from behind her and Rio thanked him as she started the car back up.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio started the car back up, and turned up the heating. The cold was really setting in now and she could feel her jacket wasn’t going to cut it any longer. She hoped Agatha was warm enough. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She pulled out of the pump station and heard her phone buzz again. Glimpsing to the side where the phone was still lying on the floor, she saw Alice’s contact pop up again. She was just out of reach of the phone and stopped the car just before she turned out onto the road again to bend down to reach the phone to answer. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio stretched and finally reached the phone but before she could answer it, it dropped out of her hand when she felt the car shake as something hit it with a loud bang.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A blur of winter colors whizzed past Agatha as she fled her capturers. She found herself laughing, almost hysterically as she wiped the tears from her face, speeding down the single lane road towards… fucking somewhere. The road felt endless and didn’t have much traffic and almost no signage to give her any idea where she was or where she was heading. She only knew she had to get away from Ralph and Evanora as quickly and far as possible. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha kept her eyes on the road, turning and straining her neck every now and then in search of any road sign, anything to tell her where the hell she was going. Her only clue was a sign saying that there was a gas stop a few miles ahead. She had no intention of stopping though, but maybe someone could help her with directions at least. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The traffic on the road was quiet with only one or two cars passing her in the last hour, so she deduced that wherever this road led, no one else seemed to be heading the same way. She had to assume that Ralph and Evanora would find a way to catch up with her eventually. Their plan had flopped and she was their liability now. They were most likely fucking pissed at her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The black van she was kidnapped in and hauled away was still parked in the driveway when she sped off in one of the goon’s cars. Now that she thought of it, she wished she could have tried to slash a tire on the van or something to slow them down even more, but that wasn’t high on her list of priorities in the heat of the moment. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shrugged internally. Whatever. She has managed to get away for now and she would be lucky if they didn’t follow her. It has been an hour and she hasn’t seen any sign of them in her rearview mirrors, but she couldn’t slow down or stop now, not until she knew she was somewhere safe. It would also be dark soon, the sun was already hanging low over the horizon to her left, meaning she was heading somewhere north, but was she going north away from Westview or north towards Westview, that was the fucking question.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha passed another sign for the gas station, getting closer to civilization with every minute. In the darkening horizon she saw the gas station and what looked like some car headlights and faint lights spilling from the gas station’s office. She slacked down as she approached.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>If she was lucky enough, she’ll have enough time to stop at the gas station to get some directions and to call Alice or Rio to let them know where she was. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>But Agatha has never really been a lucky person or someone who believed in luck up until Rio showing up at Tony’s on a random Friday night. A life spent under Evanora’s thumb would do that to you, take away all hope of luck or happy endings. That’s why Agatha always worked twice as hard as those around her, because good things and happiness was never something that just happened for her, she had to work for it and earn it.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She had to admit that she was lucky with some things. Meeting Rio was one of them and of course having Nicky and not to mention her friends and chosen family. Ok she was more lucky than others, but getting kidnapped and held hostage by your own mother didn’t seem lucky at all. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>What also didn’t feel lucky was the pain in her forehead and the small drip of blood coming from her nose as she lifted herself off the steering wheel of her getaway car. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She slowly pushed herself up and blinked to take in her surroundings. The front of the car was wrecked where the car’s hood was bent and lifted over the windscreen blocking her view. The only thing she saw of the object she hit was the flickering tail lights of another car.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fucking shit.” Agatha moaned as she felt her head throb.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She forced the door open and stumbled out of the car, nearly falling to the ground in her disorientation. When she was able to stabilize herself she turned to the car she hit. She couldn’t see the driver from where she stood and stumbled forward to see inside the car.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Draped over the passenger seat laid a woman, seemingly unconscious. </span>
<em>
<span>Oh fuck, not another one.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey! Hey! Help! Please help!” Agatha yelled to the gas station attendant who came running over towards them.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ve already called 911. They’re on their way, ma’am.” he said as he started to work on getting the car door open.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my god, is she… is she okay?” Agatha asked worriedly as the burly man tried to open the woman’s door. When it finally opened, the man carefully lifted and pulled the woman out. Agatha’s eyes were filled with tears and she sobbed loudly as she spun around, she couldn’t look, “Oh god,” she cried. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The man carefully put the woman down on the ground. “She’s okay.” he said, “She’s breathing fine.” Agatha turned back immediately, relief falling over her, but the second she got a good look at the woman in question her own legs gave way almost instantly as she met the eyes of the woman laying on the ground.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh my go… </span>
<em>
<span>RIO!</span>
</em>
<span>” Agatha yelled as she recognized her. How can this be?</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha?” Rio croaked blinking her eyes open in disbelief. “Agatha!” Rio called as she sprang upright, ignoring any pain in her body and moved with lightning speed to reach Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t believe it…” Agatha cried against Rio’s shoulder as Rio wrapped her arms around her. “How are you here? How is this…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, I’m here. I’ve got you. I’m here.” Rio answered frantically as she held Agatha close to her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held onto her so tightly, Agatha could feel her heart beat against her chest. Rio was feeling her everywhere, confirming her actually being here and alive and in her arms.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grabbed Rio’s wrists and held her teary gaze. Complete relief and disbelief filled her. She was at a total loss for words. Of all the people, of all the places and times, she managed to not only crash into someone while trying to escape her own kidnapping, no she actually crashed into Rio. The gods must be crazy.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I almost killed you.” Agatha laughed, slamming her fist into Rio’s shoulder. Her tears were now flowing freely as they finally held onto each other again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ow!” Rio flinched. “You ran into me, remember?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck sorry,” Agatha smiled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt Rio cup her cheek and for a moment everything around them faded away. The cold snowy ground they were hunched on. The flickering lights of the two smashed cars. The gas station attendant. The faint siren of the ambulance approaching. The possibility of Evanora and Ralph showing up. It was just them.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned in to press a wet, teary kiss to Rio’s lips. “What are you doing here?” she asked Rio. Agatha tucked a piece of Rio’s fringe behind her ear. A bruise was forming on her forehead. Agatha’s thumb traced over it carefully.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What am I…? Agatha, I came to find you.” Rio adjusted herself a bit to sit upright. Agatha never let go of her hand, holding onto her with everything she had left. “Alice found the address of Evanora’s hideaway house, I stole it, stole Lilia’s car…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Both of them looked at the wreck of the two cars next to them. Lilia would understand.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I couldn’t sit around and wait for another cop or detective to tell me “</span>
<em>
<span>We’re close” </span>
</em>
<span>or </span>
<em>
<span>“We need a warrant”</span>
</em>
<span> so I thought fuck that. I’m not letting them lose you, because I can’t lose you. Not again.” Rio’s smile was pained and her tears streamed down her cheeks. Agatha’s heart felt like it was bursting at the sight.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t find any words other than “I fucking love you.” She cupped Rio’s neck and brought her face closer to kiss her with all the love in her heart. “You found me.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The quiet gas station suddenly felt very crowded as the ambulance and two police vehicles pulled up to the scene. Agatha helped Rio up and Rio’s arms wrapped around Agatha’s cold body. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You’re freezing.” Rio said, rubbing Agatha’s sides.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Remind me to wear something more appropriate when I get kidnapped next time.” Agatha smirked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I even missed your smart ass mouth.” Rio laughed quietly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>A police woman approached them followed by the two EMT’s.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You ladies doin’ okay?” the officer asked. “Let’s get you checked out while I take your statements.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt uneasy leaving Rio’s side, but she followed the EMT to the ambulance to see to her head wounds. Agatha watched Rio from the back of the ambulance as she spoke to the police officer. Agatha had a lot to explain to the officers, but Rio convinced the officers to call Alice to confirm their elaborate story of Agatha’s kidnapping and eventual escape.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We need to get you checked out as well ma’am.” The EMT said to Rio as she returned to Agatha in the ambulance.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Uh, yeah sure.” Rio frowned. “Can I have a second alone with her please?” she asked the EMT, who nodded and walked off to the side to give them some privacy.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s eyes closed at the touch of Rio’s hand against her bandages on her head. “You okay?” Rio asked her quietly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I just want to get home.” Agatha sighed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The officer called Alice.” Rio said, throwing her thumb over her shoulder. “We should wait here, but they’ve got a team going to the house where they held you and she’s coming with Lilia to pick us up.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio I…” Agatha dropped her head. A dull pain spread across her skull as she started to feel the full impact of the crash. “I kill…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Shhh,” Rio said, pulling her into a hug. “Let’s have Alice and Lilia deal with that.” Rio kissed her forehead and cupped her cheek again. “What’s important now is to get you warm and to get you back to Nicky.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“He’s probably worried sick.” Agatha’s heart ached for what her poor son had to go through. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“He was so brave through it all, but I know he’ll be so happy to see you again.” Rio smiled at her warmly and Agatha couldn’t help but feel the relief settle over her that her son had Rio to comfort him through this ordeal.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you Rio.” Agatha whispered. “For finding me. For being here…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know my love.” Rio smiled, kissing her softly. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s whole body relaxed under Rio’s lips and in her embrace. Finally, she felt safe again.   </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Where the fuck are we?” Agatha asked, laughing with Rio at the absurdity of it all.</span>

<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After getting the “all good” and a thumbs up from the EMT’s and finishing both their statements with the police for the fender bender, Alice and a fleet of officers and FBI agents arrived at the gas station. When they pulled up, tires screeching and guns pointed at nothing and no one, Rio simply rolled her eyes and muttered below her breath to Agatha, “Right on time to get the undeserved credit…”. Another line of police vehicles flew past the station in the direction Agatha came from, most certainly on their way to the house where Evanora and Ralph definitely wouldn’t be at anymore unless they weren’t as clever as they thought.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Morons,” Rio snarled at the police vehicles flying by the gas station.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice stormed over to them, obviously furious, but a visible relief washed over her the minute she pulled Agatha into a hug in the back of the ambulance. Agatha groaned and brushed off her injuries as she explained what happened, but the worry and the fear of </span>
<em>
<span>“What now?” </span>
</em>
<span>still sat deep in her eyes, deeper than the small cut above her brow from the accident. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice held onto her as she walked them over to the car with Rio following behind them, too angry and emotional herself to really engage with Alice. As Alice held the back door of the SUV open for Agatha to get in, Alice turned to Rio. Both their eyes communicated in silence to the other, one saying </span>
<em>
<span>“Don’t you ever try that shit again” </span>
</em>
<span>and one saying</span>
<em>
<span> “I told you I would find her by myself”.</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>It seemed like the second Agatha’s head touched Rio’s shoulder in the back of Alice’s car she was out. Rio could feel Agatha’s body finally relax against her as she drifted off to sleep. Rio held onto her hand, loose enough to not cause any discomfort, but tight enough to remind her that she was safe, that Rio was here and that she wouldn’t ever let her go. Rio made that promise to herself and decided she would make that same promise to Agatha, as soon as they were home and safe again. For now Agatha was sound asleep, tucked under Alice’s coat to keep her warm against Rio’s side.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The car was silent except for the soft music playing over the car’s speakers. Rio recognized the song and silently mouthed along to the lyrics. Lucy Dacus singing about making up for lost time felt fitting. Rio would make up for their lost time, for the last 10 years since they met on that Halloween night and also for the awful few days they had spent apart now. </span>
<em>
<span>“But I will, I would, I did, I do. For the thrill, for my health, for myself, for you.”</span>
</em>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Along with the silence between Alice and Rio, a thick atmosphere hung like a dense cloud over them in the car as they drove back to Lilia’s from the gas station. Every now and then Alice would steal glances in the rearview mirror, sometimes checking on Agatha still slumped against Rio’s side and other times meeting Rio’s eyes only to dart away awkwardly, back to the road in front of her. Rio felt it, there was a big ass white elephant in the car with them, but honestly, Rio wasn’t really angry, but she couldn’t help the tiny bit of resentment she felt towards Alice. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Obviously it was unfair to have those feelings of resentment towards Alice, she was really just doing her job and following protocol, but in Rio’s mind and heart, there wasn’t any protocol on earth that would have kept her in that house, especially not after they found Agatha’s location. Knowing where Agatha was and not knowing what Evanora would let them do to her if she were their hostage any longer would have driven Rio fucking insane. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s okay if you need to hate me, you know.” Alice said quietly, meeting Rio’s eyes again in the rearview mirror. Rio barely caught the words over the low drum of the music still playing in the car.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio sighed as she shifted awkwardly and felt Agatha move against her side. To be honest, Rio didn’t really know what she felt other than just the relief of finding Agatha and having her safe by her side again. “I don't </span>
<em>
<span>hate</span>
</em>
<span> you Alice.” Rio said with a sigh, “I mean, you found her, I could never thank you enough for that, but you have to know, I couldn’t sit around and wait for you to go and get her.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You know the minute I got the location we had a team ready to go, but we needed to do things right..” Alice said, turning her head slightly towards the back. “If we had made just one mistake…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, you had your protocols.” Rio rolled her eyes and stared back out of the car’s window as they passed the “Welcome to Westview” sign. “You have to understand Alice. I’ve lost her once already. She vanished without a trace. I wasn’t going to let that happen again.” Rio wiped a tear from the corner of her eye and cleared her throat.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s eyes met Rio’s once more in the mirror. “You know, if we had to wait for the warrant much longer, I would have done the same.” Alice smiled. “Fuck protocol.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio smiled back at her and nodded. “Yeah?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Oh definitely. But I probably wouldn’t have literally run into her like you did. You two could have killed each other.” she laughed. Also, my tank is always full.” Alice smirked as she continued.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Fuck, I couldn’t believe it when I saw I was running out of gas. I mean, who keeps an empty car in a fucking safe house?” Rio laughed as she shook her head in disbelief.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice huffed out a silent laugh, “That place was too flashy for a safe house anyway. Who needs a fucking stable and a lawn the size of a small polo field when you are hiding out.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I guess when you are one of Lilia’s rich white collar criminals, a dingy apartment in an unknown town just won’t do.” Rio chuckled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Their laughter died down. “Will we be safe there now?” Rio asked wide eyed. “I mean they breached your security once…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We’ve amped up the security and have more bodies on site. Also, we have eyes on Evanora and Ralph now. It’s just a matter of time before we have them both in custody.” Alice was using her agent voice again.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Keep me away from your laptop, unless you want me to </span>
<em>
<span>find</span>
</em>
<span> her myself.” Rio joked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You know you won’t leave.” Alice smiled, hinting at Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, not this time.” Rio said, gently squeezing Agatha’s hand.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The bit of banter and laughter they shared the rest of the way to Lilia’s helped to further ease the tension between them and by the time they pulled into the courtyard of the safe house Rio’s demeanor towards Alice relaxed. In the end both of them cared for Agatha and both of them only wanted her to be happy and safe. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice got out of the car and met some officers guarding the front door while Rio stayed behind in the car to wake Agatha to take her inside. Rio moved gently below Agatha’s head and lightly brushed her fingers over her cheek to wake her up. “Agatha baby, we’re here.” Rio whispered against her forehead as she placed a soft kiss above her brows where the small cut was bandaged up.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha blinked to wake slowly and scrunched her face as her hand reached up to her head. The pain medicine the EMT gave her was probably wearing off already.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s get you inside, yeah?” Rio said, unbuckling them and opening the door. She ran over to the other side to open Agatha’s door and help her up and out of the car.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nicky?” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s past 2am, baby, he’s asleep already, but Maria is here with him, he’s okay.” Rio said, holding onto her side.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded sleepily and allowed Rio to lead her inside. Rio helped her up the stairs and to the bedroom they shared before the incident and sat her down on the bed.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you need, my love?” Rio asked, gently cupping her face.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Can I please get out of this filthy pajamas?” Agatha huffed, “And a shower. Fuck, I need a fucking warm shower.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and bent down to kiss her. “Okay, why don’t you get in the shower and I’ll get you new pajamas and something to drink and snack on before bed?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed her quickly and turned around to go to the kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No! Don’t!” Agatha said, almost too loud and too quick. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio froze mid step and her head snapped back to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Don’t leave.” Agatha pleaded with her hand stretched towards Rio. Her voice broke quietly and Rio’s heart broke along with it as she watched Agatha’s eyes start to fill up with tears. “Don’t leave me please. I can’t… I don’t want to be alone again.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio felt a tear run down her face and hunched down to fold her arms around Agatha who cried silently into her shoulder. “Okay, baby, I’m here. I won’t leave you alone again, I promise.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio held Agatha like that until her frantic breathing and heart rate slowed down to a normal speed. “Let me just grab something clean for you to sleep in, okay?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio walked over to the closet and took out her favorite sweater and joggers and helped Agatha to change out of the grimy pajamas she had worn for the last three days. She threw them straight into the bin, they’ll get her new ones. Agatha’s shoulders relaxed instantly and she climbed under the covers of the bed she probably missed a lot more than Rio could imagine. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When she was settled Rio cleaned the old glass she had on her night stand to fill it with water for Agatha, but before she could return with the glass of water Agatha was back to sleep already. Rio quietly placed the glass on the night stand next to her and walked around the bed to her side before getting in behind her. She turned off the bedlamp and folded her arm around Agatha’s waist, curling into her back. Agatha shifted under her hold and pressed herself tighter into Rio’s front.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio kissed Agatha’s cheek and closed her eyes for the first time in what felt like forever since Agatha was taken. Finally, Agatha was safely back in her arms where she belonged.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank you Rio...” Rio heard Agatha mutter in her sleep. “...for finding me.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll always find you my love.” Rio whispered, pulling her in tighter. “Always.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>

</p><p>
<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>Agatha’s head was throbbing when her eyes opened. For a split second she thought she was back in the dusty basement but the room was lighter and warmer and she smelled coffee and something that made her stomach grumble. She was starving, she realized. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a warm body behind her back, a steady rhythm of warm air blowing against her neck, tickling her every now and then. A lazy arm draped over her waist and held her tight in comfortable closeness. She slowly turned under the arm and carefully moved to sit up in the bed. Rio moved in her sleep, not lifting her arm off of Agatha’s middle. Agatha felt her hand twitch against her stomach as she rustled under the covers next to her. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha stared at the sleepy body beside her. Rio’s face was scrunched up against the comfy pillow and even in her sleep she had a small frown between her brows, as if she was even scrutinizing her own dreams. Agatha stretched her arms up and looked down at the sweater she was wearing. It was one of Rio’s. A worn sweater printed with “Salem Witch Trials 1692. You missed one.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha grinned and smiled. Only Rio would wear this with absolutely no shame. On second thought, she would probably have bought the exact sweater for herself. But Rio’s was warm and comfortable, and more importantly, it smelled like Rio. She’ll just have to keep it, she smirked to herself.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha chuckled a bit too loud at herself and suddenly Rio’s eyes flew open. Agatha saw her panic as her eyes opened wider than necessary and she sat up quickly. “You okay?” she muttered concerned, still sleepy.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha laughed and brushed her hand to Rio’s cheek. “Morning, yes I’m okay. I promise.” Agatha smiled lovingly at Rio who instantly relaxed and settled back down onto the pillow she was sleeping on. “My head is killing me though, and I will eat my pillow if I am not fed something decent within the next fifteen minutes.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio laughed and rolled over closer to Agatha. “Let me just hold you a bit.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio. I love you sweetheart, but I will eat you too.” Agatha said, not really joking.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Promise?” Rio smiled and bobbed her brows up and down.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha swatted her away and stood up from the bed, almost losing her balance. Her head was killing her and she felt dizzy. “Shit…” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio was by her side in a second. “Easy, your head. The EMT said there might be some dizziness. You okay?” Rio asked Agatha as she steadied herself against Rio.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yeah, I’m… okay.” Agatha said, blinking up at Rio. Rio gave her a soft kiss and lingered against her lips. Agatha had to pull herself away from Rio, they’d catch up with that later. “I missed you.” Agatha whispered. She hummed and kissed Rio again, “I want to see Nicky and can I please eat something.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes, my love.” Rio laughed, “Let’s get you fed.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha and Rio walked hand in hand down the corridor and down the stairs, more careful than Agatha would normally allow, and when they walked past the living room towards the kitchen, Agatha heard Nicky call as he ran up to her. “Mom!”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha fell to her knees instantly and her tears spilled from her eyes as she caught Nicky. “Nicky, my love!” Agatha said between kissing every part of his face. “Nicky… god I am so happy you are okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria and Lilia stood in the doorway and watched the reunion with teary smiles. Rio’s hand was anchored to Agatha’s shoulder and Agatha held Nicky as tight as he allowed her. “Mom, I missed you!” he said. “Mom said that you didn’t want to leave me and you were going to be okay, but I was still scared.” Agatha was fully crying now, tucking a small curl away from his face. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I would have never left you my love. Never.” Agatha hugged him tight and felt Rio’s hand squeeze her shoulder. She was so thankful to be safe and back with her family.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let’s have some breakfast.” Lilia broke the silence. “Nicholas, they made pancakes.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No way!” Nicky gasped excitedly. He freed himself from Agatha’s arms and ran to the breakfast table.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well, I guess pancakes trumps returning mother.” Agatha joked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It’s always been his kryptonite.” Maria laughed. “Glad you are safe, Ags.” Maria said with a heaviness in her voice. The sadness and guilt was all over her face.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’ll meet you at the table.” Rio said, kissing her cheek.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha turned back to Maria and reached out to hold her hands. “Are you okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ha,” Maria laughed tearily, “I’m not the one that was abducted.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“You are allowed to feel sad Maria,” Agatha said quietly. “I know Mel…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I’m sorry, I should have trusted you, listened to you.” Maria admitted as she interrupted Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Maria, you couldn’t have known.” Agatha comforted her. “This is not your fault, okay.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat down between Nicky and Rio at the breakfast table and when a fresh mug of coffee was placed in front of her she almost cried again. “Fuck me, I love coffee…” Agatha said, instantly bringing the mug to her lips. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Language mom!” Nicky yelled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The table erupted in laughter and what followed was the best breakfast Agatha has eaten in ages. Not because of the food, but because of the family around her. Being back safe next to her son and Rio. Her friends, Maria and Alice and her aunt, Lilia. Agatha almost lost this, but she didn’t. Now she was going to make sure she never will again.</span>

<b>
<em>Agatha’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha hoped the nightmare was over after returning to the safe house. The morning after she spent with her loved ones around the breakfast table and it felt amazing. She thanked all the stars above her to be able to have that again after what her mother almost got away with, but an undeniable feeling of dread was still hanging over her. Sure she got away, she escaped, but that didn’t mean she was safe. Not until Ralph and Evanora were finally behind bars.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>For the rest of the day after her return, Agatha spent almost every minute of the day in some form of interview with the FBI and local police repeating statement after statement. It reminded her so much of the first time she had to go through this, but fortunately this time she had Lilia by her side acting as her council. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“This time will be different dear, you have me and I am an incredible lawyer.” Lilia assured her with a wink. “Only answer what is necessary, let them fill out the blanks and I’ll do the rest.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha answered each question quickly and carefully and when she rambled too much, Lilia stepped in, nudging her with her knee if she maybe gave too much. Just like she was promised, Lilia would handle the rest. Nothing was said about dead bodies. Nothing was mentioned about any vehicular theft. Lilia made sure of it. When it seemed like the questions were leading one way, Lilia steered them back on track. In the end, they got what they came for and finally left Agatha to rest.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>That night she felt completely drained after having to relive everything that happened over and over again with each interview and eventually she passed out on the sofa next to Rio, who held her as they watched some mindless television after dinner. Agatha only woke up the next morning in bed next to Rio who probably carried her to bed the night before. She couldn't even remember that happening, but she was thankful for her, for having her here.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>After breakfast the next morning, the house quieted down as everyone kept busy for what would hopefully be the last day of staying in the safehouse. Rio took some quiet time to work on her new business plan and Lilia offered her the office for the day. Agatha wandered in and out of the office, stealing kisses every now and then. She couldn’t stay away long, not while Rio was typing away with adorable concentration and her tongue poking the side of her cheek, deep in thought.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>The last time Agatha came in, she couldn’t stand it anymore and closed the office doors behind her and quickly walked up to Rio, straddling her lap in the office chair only to kiss her deep and languidly, a promise of what to come once they’re finally alone again. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She let out a low frustrated moan when Lilia walked in on them, only clearing her throat and pretending to not see them. Agatha felt the tips of her ears burn in embarrassment and reluctantly climbed off as if nothing happened and walked out, leaving Rio smiling awkwardly at Lilia. Agatha left Rio to work after that. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Maria and Nicky were sitting in the lounge, reading under a fluffy blanket while the fireplace crackled quietly across the room. Nicky was loudly reading his favorite book to Maria who helped with the bigger words. Agatha hung in the doorway and smiled apologetically at Maria when she looked up. Nicky was starting to get much better at reading, but he was still struggling a bit and Maria always had more patience with that than Agatha did.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Feeling a little lost with everyone having something to keep themselves occupied, Agatha lazily wandered through the rest of the house looking for Alice, when she found her sitting quietly at the kitchen table. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha couldn’t help feeling like Alice was somehow hiding away from them after everything. The last couple of days were intense between them and honestly, Agatha just really wanted her friend back. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Hey Al,” Agatha called to Alice who was sitting behind her laptop, chewing at her thumbnail. Alice looked up, a little startled at the interruption, but her face softened back to normal. “Do you think we can talk?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha felt a pang of guilt flood over her as she noticed the hesitation and worry still evident in her friend’s face.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Y-yeah, sure, Ags. Uhm, we can talk.” Alice answered hesitantly, glancing back to her laptop screen once more before turning in her chair to face Agatha. Agatha smiled and walked over unhurriedly, taking a seat around the corner of the table from her. As if on instinct, Alice folded her arms over her chest as if she was bracing herself for something.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha leaned forward and gently took hold of Alice’s arms, pulling them free from her chest. “No need for that.” She smiled warmly. ”Okay?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice’s face relaxed almost instantly. “Okay…” she exhaled.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Listen Al, I wanted to thank you for… well for keeping an eye on me, on us, all these years.” Agatha leaned in a bit closer and took her friend’s hand, “You gave me some safety to, I don’t know, live and have a family and friends. In spite of what was happening in the background.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice had a small smile on her face, but she didn’t respond.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It must’ve been hard to see it all unravel, but you have to believe that I don’t blame you for anything that happened.” Agatha leaned back, fidgeting like she was nervous. “None of this was your fault and…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha,” Alice finally spoke, interrupting her, but Agatha wasn’t stopping.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“…I am definitely not blaming you for them finding me and kidnapping me. If it wasn’t here it could have been anywhere else. It’s not like I was that good at hiding anyway. I guess… I just need you to know that you’re still my best friend and…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Ags,” Alice tried to interrupt again a little louder.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“… and I know you were only doing your job…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Agatha, stop.” Alice said louder, finally get a word in. “Thank you, but you don’t need to apologize. We’re all just so happy that you are safe. I </span>
<em>
<span>am</span>
</em>
<span> sorry for having to follow protocol because believe me, I was dying inside sitting around here staring at screens and waiting for orders. And Rio… she was really fucking stupid but honestly I would have done the exact same thing.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I know, I know.” Agatha said quickly, squeezing her friend’s knee, “Still Alice, I don’t want you to feel any guilt about anything, </span>
<em>
<span>you</span>
</em>
<span> helped to find me…” Agatha’s eyes started blurring from her unshed tears building up. “Without you guys… who knows what could’ve happened.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Well luckily, now we don’t have to think about it, yeah?” Alice wiped a tear from her own eyes, “What matters is that you are safe and unharmed and that we got them, Ags.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha nodded, holding onto her friend’s hand. After a short silent moment, Agatha blinked up at Alice, not fully grasping what she just said. “What?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“We fucking </span>
<em>
<span>got</span>
</em>
<span> them Ags.” Alice smiled proudly.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“What do you mean? How?” Agatha asked, stunned and still crying.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Funny story actually.” Alice said with a soft chuckle. She closed her laptop with one hand and sat back in her chair, finally relaxing a bit more. “Turns out you managed to escape just a few minutes before the police came and stormed the house. Apparently to check on a domestic disturbance someone called in.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha gave Alice a perplexed look.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice continued explaining, “Looks like someone called the tip line a few hours after that video of you went live on the news, saying that they saw suspicious and violent activity around that area. Coincidentally, the address they gave matched a property we had on file. A direct  link to your dear mother Evanora the terrible. Cops arrived on the scene the next day, finding Ralph and Evanora scrambling into the van matching the description Rio gave the detectives.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Do you know who called the tip line?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“It was anonymous, but I have my suspicions.” Alice smirked. “I asked around to find out where the call came from but they wouldn’t tell me. But the caller did ask for only one thing in return…which in my opinion says enough…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Let me guess, the reward?” Agatha rolled her eyes. Some people rarely did something for nothing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“No, they actually declined the reward. They only had one request. Well, one message to give to you.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And?” Agatha said skeptically.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“To tell you that they were sorry for betraying you for all these years.” Alice let her sit with that for a while.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha sat back in her seat and turned her head away, mulling over the message Alice just revealed to her. From the other room, she could faintly hear Nicky still reading to Maria in the lounge. She heard Maria correct him as he struggled with another difficult word and heard Nicky give a frustrated sigh only to restart the sentence again.  </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Realization hit her just then and she turned back to face Alice again. “It was Melinda, wasn’t it?” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice smiled, quietly confirming to Agatha.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“She turned on them?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Like I said, the caller wanted to stay anonymous.” Alice shrugged, feigning nonchalance. “I’m not really supposed to tell you, but you’ll find out soon anyway. The news channels will be all over this anyway. You’ll have reporters all over you soon enough…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Vultures.” Agatha muttered.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“The police arrived as Ralph was carrying a body into the black van, obviously trying to get rid of the bodies and other evidence around the property.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha shifted uncomfortably in her seat as her face dropped. Fuck, </span>
<em>
<span>Agatha</span>
</em>
<span> killed the guy in the driveway… </span>
<em>
<span>and</span>
</em>
<span> that guy in the house? So she was probably going down for murder along with her fucking mother and Ralph.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice continued, unaware of the panic rising inside her friend, “According to the detectives, it looks like there was some struggle in the house, probably between the two guys they found dead and Ralph, who was covered in both the victims blood. They found the one guy in the house, his head was smashed in against the kitchen counter, and the other guy was stabbed in the neck with a small sharp object.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha remembered the struggle, the fight with both men and seeing them flop to the ground. Dead. She was shaking, looking up at Alice. “Alice, those men… It was self-de…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice shook her head as she kept on talking “Police arrested Ralph on the spot because his hands and DNA was all over the crime scene and Evanora, well she claimed to be innocent and turned on him quicker than a fucking blink, saying she witnessed the whole thing and promising to help the cops put him back behind bars for good if she turned state witness. So thanks to your mother…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Never thought I’d hear that sentence in a positive way…” Agatha interrupted with a smirk.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thanks to her witness statement, and Ralph obviously trying to hide evidence and move the bodies, it was apparently clear as day. Cops almost closed the case on the spot and charged Ralph for the two murders. But Ol’ Mother And Evanora’s not getting away scot-free either.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>”You’re kidding,” Agatha breathed out a laugh. It all sounded too good to be true. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Nope,” Alice said, popping the p. “They’re both in holding now, probably being booked and prepped for trial, which I don’t think will be too long from now either.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“And Evanora can’t get away again?” Agatha asked.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Alice hesitated for a minute, unsure of what else she could share, but continued anyway. “Actually, Melinda helped a lot with that. She shared </span>
<em>
<span>a lot</span>
</em>
<span> of evidence. Years of payment history, incriminating message threads… Evanora might be innocent of actual murder, but the FBI’s case against her is strong. They’ve got her Ags. It's…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Over?” Agatha finished, her mouth hanging open in utter surprise. “It’s really fucking over?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Language dear,” Lilia interrupted from behind them. Lilia laughed as the two women’s heads snapped back to her. “It’s </span>
<em>
<span>fucking</span>
</em>
<span> over.” she said, walking over to the table to join them. “Don’t worry, Agatha, I’ll make sure that those two never see the outside of a prison cell again… and that judge your mother paid off, he’s in a world of trouble himself.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha suddenly didn’t know what to feel. Was this really over? Her life ended and started again when she became Agatha and she hasn’t known anything else since then. Now, with no one to run from… “Really?” Agatha asked tearily, still very much in shock, “Is it really over?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Lilia smiled warmly. “We’ll handle everything else, but yes Agatha, it’s over.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha dropped her head into her hands and cried loudly. Of relief, of loss, of finally being free. Truly, truly free. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Warm arms wrapped around her from behind, cradling her lovingly and soft kisses were placed on the side of her head. She lifted her head from her hands and blinked though her tears, seeing Rio’s face inches away from her. “Rio…” she sighed, “It’s over.” </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Yes my love.” Rio said, kissing her forehead again. “It’s over. We can go home now.”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>

<b>
<em>Rio’s POV</em>
</b>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Rio,” Agatha whispered in the dark of Agatha’s bedroom. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio’s eyes blinked against the dark of the room and it took her a few seconds to remind herself where she was. Not at the safe house, but back in Westview, in Agatha’s bed. Rio turned to her side, cupping Agatha’s face. “My love?”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“I can’t sleep.” Agatha whispered again. “Fuck, sorry to wake you. Go back. Go back to sleep.” She said, giving her a quick kiss.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio grabbed the back of Agatha’s neck and pulled Agatha’s lips back onto hers. Agatha’s lips moved with hers, slowly, sleepily and without any demand. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Not going…” kiss, “...back to sleep…” kiss, “...if you…” kiss, “...kiss me…” kiss, “...like this...” Rio managed to say.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She felt Agatha smile against her mouth and deepening the kiss as she moved over Rio’s body in one swift glide of her body.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>The weight of Agatha’s body on Rio’s felt familiar and yet like she’s been missing it all her life. She held onto Agatha’s hips as their kisses grew more deliberate and hungrier and when Agatha’s knee moved between Rio’s legs, and adding pressure Rio let out an audible moan, breaking away from the kiss and throwing her head back.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha obviously saw this as the perfect opportunity to attack Rio’s neck, licking and biting wherever her mouth landed. Rio’s body shivered and she cupped Agatha’s head, holding her in place, silently encouraging her to continue. And Agatha did. Rio’s head felt like it was spinning, feeling Agatha’s warm tongue lick down her throat and following her collarbone to her shoulder where she pulled Rio’s oversized shirt away to gain more access to her skin.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Take this off.” Agatha mumbled against her skin and Rio pulled her shirt up, instantly regretting the loss of Agatha’s mouth against her, but that was short lived as Agatha leaned back immediately, continuing her open mouthed kisses over Rio’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio tucked her chin and looked down, straining her eyes to see Agatha’s face but the room was too dark. Her warm mouth made its way to her nipple, already erect from the cool air of the room mixed with the building arousal from having Agatha grind her knee on Rio’s hot center.</span>
</p><p>
<span> </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
<span>“Baby,” Rio breathed, but the rest of her words got stuck in her throat as Agatha added teeth, pinching the pebbled nub at the same time as adding a strong thrust with her knee.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>This felt unreal. It was too dark to see anything, so Rio could only feel and listen, and Agatha took advantage of that, it seemed, humming and moaning as she flicked and licked at Rio’s breasts.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Eventually Rio couldn’t stand it anymore and pushed herself up, lifting Agatha up along with her. Agatha found Rio’s mouth again and Rio kissed her back, almost desperately, pulling at Agatha’s sleep shirt and finally getting it loose and off of her.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha remained on her knees, straddling Rio’s thigh and bending down to keep kissing her. Rio snaked a hand to the front of Agatha’s pants and cupped her, resulting in a deep moan falling from Agatha’s mouth into hers. Agatha ground herself on Rio’s hand and Rio could feel the heat pooling in Agatha’s pants, starting to soak through the gusset of her underwear.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s hand found Rio’s wetness as well and added her own pressure as she ground her hand into Rio’s in time with her own hips. Rio felt like she was on the verge of exploding into Agatha’s hand so to keep herself from letting this end too soon she picked Agatha up by the hips and flipped them over, letting Agatha fall to the bed. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t waste time and started a trail of kisses from Agatha’s neck, over her breasts, down her stomach and as she moved down further the pulled the soaked underwear away and tossed them to the side, never stopping her kisses and licks on her way down.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>When her tongue slid between the wet folds Agatha let out a squeal and grabbed the back of Rio’s head, keeping her in place, as if Rio had anywhere else she’d rather be right now. She alternated between slow deep licks and quick flicks against her clit, driving Agatha insane. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio could feel Agatha’s hips start to buck up and felt Agatha pull her head closer, indicating that she was on the verge of reaching her peak, but Rio wanted to prolong this even more. This was too good. Agatha tasted and sounded too good.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>She slowed her tongue and started circling Agatha’s entrance with her fingers, and dipped in and out gently, only up to her first knuckle.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Baby, fuck…” Agatha moaned, “Stop fucking teasing…”</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>But Rio ignored her and smiled against her, giving her clit a light kiss again, feeling Agatha’s hips jolt up again. She kept teasing her entrance, never adding any more pressure or going in any deeper than she had been doing.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha’s moans grew louder as her frustration built and Rio gave in a bit more, dipping her fingers in deeper and starting to lick through her folds more intently again, still slow but deliberate again and the moans and movements coming from Agatha showed that this was doing exactly what Rio intended, building her up and up closer to orgasm.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was squirming above her, muttering nonsense and never letting go of Rio’s head then Rio pushed her fingers all the way in just as Agatha’s orgasm ripped through her, strong enough to lift her torso off the bed. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio didn’t let up, kept licking and sucking and pumping her fingers, allowing Agatha to ride out her orgasm while another was slowly building. </span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha was now essentially grinding Rio’s face against herself and Rio fought for air but kept at it, she’ll breathe again later, and with a loud moan that threatened to rattle the walls of the house, Agatha came against Rio’s face, coating her cheeks and mouth.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Agatha slumped back onto the bed and Rio slowly kissed her way up to Agatha’s mouth again, giving her time to catch her breath.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>“Thank god I survived, because I would die of disappointment if I missed out on whatever </span>
<em>
<span>this</span>
</em>
<span> was.” Agatha panted.</span>
</p><p>
<br/>
<br/>
</p><p>
<span>Rio giggled softly, and kissed her face, “Who said I'm done with you?”</span>
