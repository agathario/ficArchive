The Art of Appearances

The Maximoff residence was not the grandest in London, but it had a reputation for hosting curious company—scientists, artists, philosophers, and those who blurred the lines between them. It was a known fact that Dr. Victor "Vision" Maximoff, esteemed professor of natural philosophy, cared little for the rigid expectations of society, much to the mild horror of his wife, Wanda.

It was through this circle that Professor Rio Vidal found herself invited to dinner. A scholar of anatomy and natural sciences, Rio was accustomed to uneasy stares from fellow academics—the consequence of living a carefully crafted lie. As far as London knew, Professor Vidal was a reserved, sharp-eyed gentleman with a penchant for quiet debate and dark green waistcoats.

But Rio had long since accepted that the only way to own her life was to live it behind a mask.

She hadn’t expected the dinner to be anything other than another round of stilted conversation. That was before Agatha Harkness opened the door.

The woman standing in the Maximoff foyer was... remarkable. High-necked gown of deep violet, raven-dark hair swept up with just enough softness to whisper of rebellion. She inclined her head with that cool, almost imperious grace Rio had only seen among the old aristocracy. But there was a sharp glint in her eye, as if the whole world was some grand joke she hadn’t yet decided to share.

“Professor Vidal,” Agatha greeted, voice smooth as silk. “Welcome. I am Miss Harkness, the boys’ governess.”

And something in Rio stirred.

She bowed slightly. “A pleasure, Miss Harkness.”

Agatha’s gaze lingered, narrowing just so. “The pleasure remains to be seen.”

Dinner was a lively affair, thanks mostly to Thomas, who insisted on calling Agatha “Anastasia” throughout the meal.

“You’ll have to forgive Theobald,” Agatha said dryly, not missing a beat, as Thomas launched into a ridiculous story of chasing a goose through the garden.

“I am Thomas,” the boy huffed.

“Are you sure?” Agatha sipped her wine.

Rio bit back a grin.

It was like watching a cat toy with a mouse that wasn’t quite sure it was losing.

Later, with Wanda and Vision distracted by the boys, Rio found herself beside Agatha, alone on the balcony.  They spoke of education, independence, the absurdities of London’s social season. But beneath every word was something else.

For Agatha, it was confusion. Why did her heart flutter at the faintest smile from a man she’d only just met? Moreover, why did her heart flutter around a man at all?  She had come to realize years before that her affection lay with women, and she had no desire for marriage, especially to a man. 

Yet here was Professor Vidal, with sharp wit, gentle hands, and eyes that seemed to see her.

For Rio, it was guilt and longing in equal measure. She’d played many roles to survive, but never before had she wanted someone to know the truth. She hadn’t planned on meeting someone like Agatha—clever, bold, untouchable.

But as Agatha turned toward her, eyes catching in the low evening light, Rio wondered if this might be the one person who could understand her better than anyone else.

And she wondered—

Would Agatha ever forgive her for being a woman behind a man’s name?

Dinner was a lively affair, thanks mostly to Thomas, who insisted on calling Agatha “Anastasia” throughout the meal.

“You’ll have to forgive Theobald,” Agatha said dryly, not missing a beat, as Thomas launched into a ridiculous story of chasing a goose through the garden.

“I am Thomas,” the boy huffed.

“Am I?” Agatha sipped her wine.

Rio smothered a grin behind her glass, and caught Agatha’s eye just as she did. The faintest twitch at the corner of Agatha’s lips sent a strange, unwelcome warmth through her.

Vision, ever the host, steered the conversation forward. “Professor Vidal, Agatha has a particular gift for languages. You may share a mutual interest—weren’t you just lecturing on the evolution of language structures in trade societies?”

Rio set her glass down. “I dabble in the study of dialects, yes. I find it fascinating how language shifts according to who holds power—and who wishes to keep it.”

Agatha turned to her, eyebrows lifted with real interest. “And yet it never truly silences those without power. Only changes the way they speak.”

Rio met her gaze fully. “Exactly.”

A slow smile curved Agatha’s lips—not a polite dinner smile, but something sharper, like she was seeing Rio anew.

“I had thought myself alone in that opinion,” Agatha murmured.

“Evidently not.”

“Evidently not,” Agatha echoed softly.

Wanda gave her husband a look—a barely concealed spark of amusement passing between them. Vision simply sipped his wine.

Thomas leaned toward his brother and whispered loudly, “Do you think Anastasia is flirting with the professor?”

Agatha didn’t blink. “Theobald, for someone who cannot parse Latin, you’re remarkably quick with social cues.”

Billy nearly choked on his bread.

========

After dinner, as Wanda and Vision retreated to the parlor, the boys darted ahead toward the balcony doors, eager for some measure of freedom before being sent to their studies.

“Thomas Maximoff,” Wanda called after them, “mind yourself—”

“I always do,” Thomas replied, far too innocently.

Billy snorted and gave his brother a shove toward the balcony.

Agatha moved to follow, prepared for the usual battle of wits that accompanied supervising the twins—but Rio’s voice stopped her.

“May I?” Rio asked quietly.

Agatha blinked. “You wish to brave them?”

Rio gave a slow, measured smile. “I’ve taught university boys. How much worse can they be?”

Agatha huffed a soft laugh. “Godspeed, Professor.”

She stood near the doorway as Rio stepped onto the balcony where the twins were already leaning over the balustrade, discussing how far a coin might fall before it became lethal.

“You’d need a great deal more height than this,” Rio said, her voice casual as she joined them.

Both boys spun around.

“Are you certain?” Thomas asked, eyes narrowing with challenge.

“Quite.” Rio folded her arms. “A coin will reach terminal velocity after about ninety meters. This balcony is—what—five?”

Billy perked up. “So… if we dropped one from Big Ben—”

“—You’d still risk serious harm to someone below,” Rio said with a sharp look. “Which is why you’ll not attempt it.”

Thomas’s grin turned sly. “But you’ve thought about it.”

Rio matched his grin with a faint one of her own. “Of course. The difference is, I know better.”

Agatha couldn’t help herself. She watched, arms crossed, as Rio leaned in slightly, explaining something about wind resistance and mass with the same calm authority she’d used at the dinner table. But there was something… gentle in the way she spoke to the boys. Not condescending. Not cold.

She treated them like people.

Agatha’s lips pressed into a thin line, the weight of unfamiliar awareness settling in her chest. She was used to men patronizing the twins or ignoring them entirely. Rio—

She was different.

When Rio caught her watching from the doorway, her expression softened.

“Care to join us, Miss Harkness?”

Agatha tilted her head, smirking faintly. “I wouldn’t dare interrupt a lesson in criminal physics.”

“I believe we’ve concluded.” Rio glanced at the twins. “Haven’t we?”

Thomas gave a dramatic sigh. “I suppose.”

Billy, ever the peacekeeper, grinned. “It was quite informative.”

Agatha chuckled softly, shaking her head as she stepped out to stand beside Rio.

They stood there a moment, the evening breeze threading between them.

“I see the boys have met their match,” Agatha said.

Rio turned to her, eyes searching. “Have I met mine?”

Agatha felt her breath catch—and hated herself for it. She arched a brow, cool as ever. “I should hope not, Professor. You’d find yourself sorely outmatched.”

Rio’s smile was slow, almost fond. “I rather think I wouldn’t mind that.”

=======

When the twins were finally sent inside—Thomas with an exaggerated bow and Billy with an apologetic smile—Agatha lingered at the balustrade. She half-expected Rio to follow the boys in.

She did not.

Instead, Rio remained beside her, hands folded behind her back, gaze fixed on the deepening violet sky.

For a long moment, they stood in silence. It wasn’t uncomfortable. It wasn’t quite companionable either. It felt… balanced.

“You surprised me tonight,” Agatha said at last.

Rio turned her head slightly. “How so?”

“You handled Thomas.” Agatha gave a soft, sardonic smile. “That alone deserves a medal.”

Rio gave a quiet chuckle. “I find boys like him often want someone to notice them. Once you do, they lose the need to scream for attention.”

Agatha hummed. “And yet they seldom get that from men in your profession.”

Rio gave her a sidelong glance. “I am not most men in my profession.”

Something in her tone—low, edged with quiet defiance—snagged at Agatha’s heart in a way she couldn’t explain.

She folded her arms. “No… I suppose you aren’t.”

Their eyes met again. This time, neither looked away.

Agatha spoke before she quite meant to. “I’ve… never known a man quite like you.”

Rio’s jaw tensed, but her expression softened. “Nor I a woman like you.”

Agatha laughed under her breath, shaking her head. “Be careful, Professor. People will think you’re flirting.”

“I rather thought I was.”

The words landed softly but firmly between them.

Agatha’s heart gave a treacherous thud. She turned back toward the garden, letting the night air cool her flushed cheeks. “Well. That would be a waste of your efforts.”

Rio tilted her head. “Because?”

Agatha forced herself to look at her. Forced herself to speak the truth she’d never bothered to hide before. “Because I have no interest in men.”

Rio’s dark eyes flickered—something unreadable passing behind them. And then, almost imperceptibly, her shoulders eased.

“I see.”

Agatha expected awkwardness. Expected a withdrawal.

Instead, Rio leaned on the balustrade beside her, voice low and even. “Then perhaps it is fortunate I’m not particularly good at being one.”

Agatha frowned, glancing over. “Pardon?”

But Rio only smiled. The kind of smile that left more unsaid than spoken.

“I should see myself home,” Rio murmured. “Before I forget how to behave entirely.”

She bowed slightly, and before Agatha could summon a reply, Rio turned and disappeared into the house—

Leaving Agatha on the balcony, staring after her with a heart pounding for reasons she dared not name.

=======
Chapter Two

The night air in London was crisp by the time Rio Vidal reached the modest flat she kept on the outskirts of the city—a narrow, book-strewn space with little in the way of luxury but plenty of privacy.

She leaned back against the closed door, exhaling slowly.

Fool.

She pulled off her cravat, tossing it onto a chair, and scrubbed a hand through her hair, undoing the careful slicked-back style that lent her an edge of masculine sharpness. The dark waves fell forward, softer, too revealing.

What had possessed her?

She’d spent years—years—crafting the perfect mask. The right cut of coat, the precise tilt of the chin, the steady hand with a cane or a book or a glass of brandy. She had slipped through society’s cracks like smoke, untouchable because she belonged to no one.

And yet… one evening in the company of Agatha Harkness, and she’d nearly ruined it all.

“I am not particularly good at being one.”

She could hear her own voice, low and reckless, rolling back in her mind.

Brilliant, Vidal. Why not just rip your shirt open and shout it from the rooftops?

What if Agatha had heard the edge beneath her words? What if she’d guessed?

Worse—what if she hadn’t, and Rio had left her thinking she’d been toying with her affections?

Rio sat heavily in the worn armchair by the hearth, resting her elbows on her knees.

This wasn’t like her. She didn’t lose her composure—not with society, not with colleagues, certainly not with a woman she’d met all of four hours earlier.

And yet—

She let her eyes close, just for a moment, and conjured the image of Agatha standing at the balustrade. The sharp lines of her profile. The careful way she measured her words. The spark of defiance in her gaze that no amount of London etiquette could dim.

Rio had met bold women before. Clever ones. Sharp ones.

But never one who looked at her—not the mask, not the name—but her, with something that felt like curiosity. Like challenge.

And that—

That was dangerous.

Because for the first time in a long while, Rio didn’t know if she wanted to keep pretending.
=======
Agatha Harkness prided herself on her composure.

She survived London’s endless parade of simpering matrons and self-important lords with her wit intact. She’d stood her ground against shrieking Maximoff twins and highborn families who whispered about her "unnatural independence."

And yet…

There she stood the next morning, staring far too long at the embroidery she was supposed to be correcting, while Billy and Thomas conducted a full-scale debate over breakfast.

“So when do you think he will call again?” Billy asked, a little too innocently.

“He?” Thomas echoed, grinning like a devil. “Oh, you mean Professor Vidal. Agatha’s new admirer.”

Agatha didn’t even look up. “His name is Theodore.”

Billy snorted into his tea. “That’s not even—”

“Apologies. Professor Theodore Vidal.” She set her embroidery down with precise care. “And as for his calling again, I imagine you’ll have to harass your father about that. I’ve no say in Professor Vidal’s schedule.”

Thomas leaned forward on his elbows, chin in hand. “You liked him.”

Agatha met his gaze coolly. “I liked that he didn’t encourage your criminal inclinations.”

Billy grinned. “But you liked him.”

Agatha opened her mouth—then shut it again.

What exactly was she meant to say? That yes, she had liked him—more than she could explain? That despite every sensible instinct she possessed, she had caught herself thinking about the exact curve of Rio Vidal’s smile when they’d exchanged those ridiculous barbs?

And worse… that she had felt drawn in a way she never had toward any man?

She couldn’t even blame Rio for it entirely. Agatha knew herself. Knew her preferences. Knew the sharp, aching reality of what it meant to be a woman who could never quite want what she was supposed to want.

But Rio…

There was something off about him. Not wrong, not sinister. Just—
Different.

A man who didn’t leer, didn’t patronize, didn’t puff himself up like an overstuffed peacock. A man who met her mind first—and made her want to meet his.

And that, Agatha realized with a cold knot in her chest, was precisely why he was dangerous.

She stood abruptly, smoothing her skirts.

“Gentlemen,” she said crisply. “If I hear one more word about Professor Vidal over breakfast, I will assign you Latin exercises until your eyes cross.”

Thomas blinked. “Is that a yes or a no?”

Agatha gave him a thin, dangerous smile. “That’s a run along before I make good on my threat.”

The boys scrambled out of their chairs, half-laughing, half-fearing.

When they were gone, Agatha sat back down.

And stared at her embroidery again.

You are a grown woman, she told herself. Not a schoolgirl with a fancy for a pair of dark eyes and a clever tongue.

She picked up her needle—then set it down again.

And wondered, for the first time in her carefully managed life, what exactly she’d do if Professor Rio Vidal did call again.
=======
It was a simple plan.

Stay away.

Rio Vidal had repeated it to herself at least a dozen times since returning home the night before.

She would steer clear of the Maximoffs' social circle. Decline any further invitations. Keep her distance from governesses with sharp eyes and sharper tongues who had no business making her heart stutter.

It was logical. Clean. Safe.

She even said it aloud that morning, as she buttoned her waistcoat before the mirror.

“I am not getting involved.”

Her reflection stared back, unimpressed.

“I’m not.”

She tugged on her coat, ran a hand through her hair, tied it back with practiced precision. She would be Professor Vidal—aloof, professional, entirely uninterested in dark-haired women with amused smirks and a maddening ability to throw her off-balance.

It would work. It had to work.

Which, of course, was exactly why—

“Ah, Vidal!”

Rio turned sharply as she stepped into the courtyard outside her lecture hall.

Vision Maximoff was striding toward her with his usual serene expression and a letter in hand.

“I’m glad I caught you,” Vision said. “Wanda insists you come to supper tomorrow. A smaller affair—just family.”

Rio opened her mouth to protest—

“And Agatha will be there, of course.”

Of course.

Vision’s mild gaze sharpened slightly. “Wanda thinks it will do Agatha good to have a… broader circle of friends.”

Rio smiled tightly. “I doubt I qualify as an appropriate companion for a governess.”

Vision arched a brow. “You seemed quite appropriate last night.”

Rio felt her ears warm.

Vision gave a quiet, knowing hum. “I’ll expect you at seven.”

And before Rio could argue, Vision turned and walked away, hands clasped behind his back.

Rio stood there for a moment, staring after him—

Then exhaled a slow, resigned breath.

“Brilliant,” she muttered. “Just brilliant.”
=======
Rio tightened the knot of her cravat twice before giving up.

She wasn’t nervous.

Not really.

She’d attended dinners with far more dangerous company—lords with sharp tongues, fellow scholars eager to sniff out a fraud, magistrates who would ruin her if they suspected even a whisper of the truth.

And yet…

Tonight wasn’t about danger. Not exactly.

It was about Agatha Harkness.

And the fact that Rio still hadn’t decided if she wanted to stay hidden from her… or be seen.

She paced the length of her modest sitting room, coat already fastened, gloves waiting on the armchair.

It’s just supper, she told herself. You’ll go. You’ll smile. You’ll behave.

No clever remarks. No heated glances. No reckless confessions hovering beneath words.

She would be Professor Vidal. As always.

And if Agatha Harkness met her eyes with that sharp, unreadable look again…

Well. Rio would have to deal with that when it happened.

She exhaled slowly, rolling her shoulders back.

Control. You are in control.

Then promptly cursed under her breath when her heart gave a hard, traitorous thud at the mere thought of Agatha’s voice saying her name.

Meanwhile…

In the Maximoff drawing room, Wanda poured tea with the air of a woman who definitely wasn’t up to something.

“Professor Vidal is coming to supper tomorrow,” Wanda said lightly, setting the teapot down with delicate precision.

Across from her, Agatha didn’t even look up from her needlework. “Is he?”

“He is,” Wanda confirmed, adding a lump of sugar to her own cup. “Vision extended the invitation this morning.”

“Hm.”

Silence stretched between them.

Wanda stirred her tea with a slow, practiced rhythm. “You seemed to enjoy his company.”

Agatha’s needle paused mid-stitch.

“I enjoy the company of most men who don’t treat me like a curiosity or a threat,” she replied, voice even.

Wanda smiled faintly over the rim of her cup. “Of course.”

Agatha resumed her stitching. “And I assume you’ll be inviting half the city as well?”

“Oh no.” Wanda set her spoon aside. “Just the family. The boys. You.”

Agatha met her gaze then—flat, suspicious. “And Professor Vidal.”

Wanda’s eyes twinkled with something dangerously close to mischief. “Naturally.”

Agatha sighed, setting her work aside with exaggerated care. “Honestly, Wanda. If I didn’t know better, I’d think you were matchmaking.”

Wanda sipped her tea, perfectly serene. “If you didn’t know better.”

Agatha narrowed her eyes.

Wanda merely smiled.

And that was how Agatha knew—without a shred of doubt—that Wanda Maximoff knew exactly what she was doing.
=======
It was supposed to be simple.

A quiet family supper.

Agatha Harkness had prepared herself for exactly that—a calm, uneventful evening in the Maximoff home, filled with predictable conversation and an inevitable round of Thomas’s antics.

But the moment Rio Vidal stepped through the door, all her careful expectations unraveled.

Not that she would admit it.

Not even when she caught herself noticing the way Rio’s dark green coat set off her sharp features. Or how easily she slipped into conversation with Wanda, exchanging quiet remarks with Vision as though this dinner were nothing out of the ordinary.

Agatha prided herself on control. On reading people. On never letting her guard slip.

So why did this particular guest feel so… unsettling?

Why did the air in the room seem to shift every time Rio’s gaze brushed hers?

Dinner began politely enough.

Wanda steered the conversation toward Vision’s latest lecture, the twins chiming in with the occasional irreverent comment. Rio kept her responses measured, her posture composed—every inch the visiting academic.

And yet…

It was in the small things.

The way Rio met Agatha’s eyes when Thomas bragged about his latest prank—and didn’t look away.

The soft, almost imperceptible smirk that played at the edge of Rio’s mouth when Agatha corrected Billy’s Latin.

The way her voice dropped, low and sincere, when she addressed Agatha directly.

“You’ve a remarkable command of languages, Miss Harkness.”

Agatha arched a brow, keeping her tone cool. “One of the few useful things my family bothered to insist upon.”

Rio’s eyes flickered with something soft—understanding, perhaps. “Then I envy your tutors.”

Agatha tilted her head. “You’d rather have my tutors or my family?”

Rio smiled, just a touch crooked. “Only the opportunity to have met you sooner.”

Agatha’s breath caught—

But Wanda was already chiming in, deftly diverting the conversation before either of them could say something they’d regret.

By the time the meal ended, Agatha was acutely aware of three things:

One—Rio Vidal was far too charming for anyone’s good.

Two—she did not appreciate the way Wanda kept glancing between them with thinly veiled amusement.

And three—she wanted to see Rio again.
=======
The Maximoffs made no move to separate after supper, for which Agatha was both grateful and mildly annoyed.

She sat in the drawing room with her embroidery in hand—though her needle hadn’t moved in ten minutes. The soft clink of glassware and low hum of conversation filled the space around her.

Wanda poured sherry into delicate glasses, Vision and Rio already deep in a conversation about the university’s latest policy on admitting scholars from the continent. The twins were huddled in the corner, playing cards with the quiet intensity of two boys who thought themselves master strategists.

It should have been a perfectly ordinary scene.

But it wasn’t.

Not when Rio kept glancing her way during every lull in conversation.

Not when Agatha caught herself waiting for those glances.

“You’re unusually quiet tonight, Miss Harkness.”

Rio’s voice cut gently through the room’s hum. Not loud enough to draw attention, but direct enough that Wanda, at least, noticed—and gave Agatha a glance over her sherry glass that said oh, this is getting interesting.

Agatha set her embroidery aside with practiced grace. “I find it best not to interrupt when the learned men are in discourse.”

Rio arched a brow, leaning back in her chair, wine glass turning slowly between gloved fingers. “Then I fear the conversation suffers in your silence.”

A slow smile tugged at Agatha’s lips before she could stop it. “Careful, Professor. I might take that as flattery.”

“Only if you wish to.”

Agatha’s heart gave a small, traitorous lurch.

Wanda, ever the perfect hostess, rose smoothly. “I believe the boys need settling for the evening. Vision, would you assist me?”

Vision gave a serene nod, following Wanda toward the boys with a quiet word of encouragement.

Leaving Rio and Agatha alone in the soft quiet of the drawing room.

Agatha folded her hands in her lap. “Do you always flirt with governesses at your friends’ homes?”

Rio held her gaze steadily. “No.”

“Pity. I’d hoped this was a habit. I find habits easier to disregard than… intentions.”

Rio’s expression shifted—softened, almost. “What if I told you I had no intentions? That I am merely… curious.”

Agatha leaned forward slightly, voice low. “About what, precisely?”

Rio took a slow sip of her wine, setting the glass aside on the small table between them.

“About how a woman like you came to be here—so entirely herself in a world that would rather you weren’t.”

Agatha felt something sharp twist in her chest. She swallowed it down with a careful, composed smile.

“I imagine the answer is much the same as yours,” she murmured. “Survival. Adaptation.”

Rio’s eyes darkened—something flickering behind them.

For a moment, neither spoke.

The soft rustle of Wanda’s skirts in the hallway signaled their hosts’ brief absence.

Rio leaned forward, her voice low but steady. “You don’t know me.”

Agatha met her gaze without flinching. “No. I don’t.”

Rio’s lips curved—not a smile, not quite. “Perhaps you shouldn’t.”

Agatha’s pulse raced, though her expression remained cool. “Perhaps I should decide that for myself.”

Rio held her eyes for a long moment… then inclined her head slightly, as if conceding a private battle.

And in that quiet space between them, something shifted—dangerous, undeniable, and entirely their own.


=======
The fire crackled softly, filling the drawing room with a low, steady warmth.

Agatha reached for her glass, fingers wrapping lightly around the stem. “Your university work keeps you in London, I imagine?”

Rio nodded, settling more comfortably into her chair. “For now. It’s… convenient.”

“Convenient.” Agatha tilted her head. “Is that all?”

Rio gave a soft, humorless chuckle. “Convenience is often the best shield.”

Agatha’s lips curved. “And here I thought you were a man of grand ambition.”

Rio’s eyes glinted. “I prefer smaller ambitions. They draw less attention.”

They were sparring again—light, easy, but edged with something they both pretended wasn’t there.

Agatha lifted her glass to her lips, voice low. “And yet, despite your shields… you’ve no wife. No betrothal. Unusual for a man of your age and standing.”

The question slipped out far too smoothly. Almost like it wasn’t a question at all.

Rio’s gaze didn’t waver. “You’ve been asking around?”

Agatha met her eyes. “Should I?”

A slow smile curved Rio’s mouth—wry, soft at the edges. “No need. The truth is, I’ve never found anyone willing to overlook my… eccentricities.”

Agatha hummed. “Eccentricities.”

Rio nodded. “A tendency toward independence. A lack of patience for expectation.” She set her glass down gently. “It doesn’t make for an appealing prospect in the marriage market.”

Agatha gave a soft, amused sound. “I wouldn’t know. I’ve never entered that market.”

Rio leaned forward slightly, resting her forearms on her knees. “Never?”

Agatha met her gaze evenly. “Not once.”

Something flickered between them—an understanding neither named.

Rio sat back again, voice quieter now. “Do you regret it?”

Agatha took her time, swirling the wine in her glass before replying. “I’ve found no reason to.”

Rio’s eyes held hers for a long moment. “Then we have that in common.”

Wanda’s soft footsteps sounded at the edge of the hallway, but neither woman turned.

Agatha lifted her glass. “To common ground.”

Rio’s fingers brushed against hers as she reached for her own glass—a faint touch, entirely too intentional to be accidental.

“To common ground,” Rio echoed.

And just before Wanda swept back into the room—smiling far too serenely—Agatha wondered if perhaps she wasn’t the only one in this room holding a secret too dangerous to share.
=======
The evening wound down too quickly.

The twins returned—Thomas attempting to sneak an extra biscuit before Agatha’s sharp look sent him scampering off. Vision offered polite conversation about an upcoming lecture. Wanda smiled with the serene grace of a woman who saw everything and said nothing.

And through it all, Rio stole glances at Agatha.

It wasn’t overt. Not enough for anyone but Agatha to notice. But the weight of it settled over her skin like the faint warmth of a fire burning just out of reach.

When Rio finally rose to leave, Agatha rose as well—because of course she did. It would have been improper to let a guest leave unescorted, even if every instinct told her this was a terrible idea.

“I’ll see Professor Vidal out,” Agatha said smoothly, ignoring the look Wanda gave her over the rim of her teacup.

At the door, Rio paused, glancing over her shoulder as Agatha reached for the latch.

“Thank you,” Rio said quietly.

Agatha arched a brow. “For what?”

Rio held her gaze a long moment. “For not asking questions you don’t really want the answers to.”

Agatha’s heart gave a sharp, traitorous thud.

She forced a cool smile. “Who says I don’t want them?”

Rio smiled faintly, stepped closer. “I think… if you wanted them, you’d have asked already.”

Agatha opened her mouth—but Rio only gave a slight bow of her head.

“Good evening, Miss Harkness.”

And with that, she slipped out into the night, leaving Agatha standing in the soft hush of the Maximoff entryway, pulse fluttering like a trapped bird.

She didn’t realize Wanda was behind her until the soft voice cut through the quiet:

“An interesting guest.”

Agatha turned, half a glare on her lips. “How long were you standing there?”

Wanda gave a serene smile. “Long enough.”

Agatha crossed her arms. “If you’re about to make some remark—”

“I wasn’t.” Wanda stepped forward, her gaze softer now. “I was only going to say… sometimes, people carry secrets because it’s the only way they know how to survive.”

Agatha stilled.

Wanda reached out, laying a gentle hand on her arm. “I’m just glad you met someone who understands that.”

Agatha looked away, swallowing the sharp retort that leapt to her tongue.

Because damn her—Wanda wasn’t wrong.

Not this time.
=======
It started, as these things often did, with something small.

Agatha hadn’t planned to watch Rio that closely at the next gathering—a small afternoon tea Wanda insisted upon hosting. She certainly hadn’t planned to notice details.

And yet…

When Rio arrived, coat neatly tailored, gloved hands clasped behind her back in a posture far too careful to be natural, Agatha’s eyes caught on the line of her shoulders.

Not broad, not sharp with the kind of weight most men carried. More… lean. Controlled.

It could be explained by Rio’s slight build. That was easy. Dismissible.

But then—

As Wanda introduced Rio to a neighbor, the man reached forward to clap a friendly hand on Rio’s shoulder.

Rio stepped subtly aside. Fluid, seamless, like part of the motion had been planned. But Agatha saw it—saw the fractional tightening of her posture, the flicker of guardedness that wasn’t offense… but something else entirely.

Doesn’t like being touched.

Agatha tilted her head, watching as Rio smiled politely, answered smoothly—too smoothly.

She spoke like a man who had memorized how men speak.

When the neighbor wandered off, Agatha crossed the room, cool composure in place.

“You are a marvel of diplomacy, Professor.”

Rio turned, giving her that soft, sharp smile. “Not at all. I’ve merely learned when to smile and when to avoid a scene.”

Agatha gave a soft hum. “That’s a skill most men never bother to learn.”

For the briefest moment—less than a heartbeat—Rio’s eyes flickered with something like surprise.

Then she inclined her head. “Perhaps I’m not most men.”

No, Agatha thought, pulse quickening. You certainly are not.

But she only smiled, folding her hands neatly before her. “No… I don’t believe you are.”

And as Rio’s smile faltered—just slightly—Agatha felt something shift in the air between them.

She didn’t know what Rio was hiding. Not yet.

But she knew, with quiet certainty, that she wasn’t imagining it.
=======
The afternoon stretched longer than Rio intended.

She had stayed out of sheer politeness—conversing with Wanda, fielding Vision’s quiet academic jabs, charming a few minor dignitaries. It was nothing she hadn’t done before.

But now… Agatha was watching her.

Not openly. Not rudely.

But with the precise, attentive gaze of someone cataloguing details.

And Rio felt it like a weight on the back of her neck.

She caught it again as she stood near the mantelpiece, listening to Wanda recount some minor scandal. Out of the corner of her eye, she saw Agatha cross the room, retrieve a cup of tea… and glance over her shoulder at Rio.

Their eyes met.

Agatha smiled—just faintly. A polite, inscrutable curve of her lips.

And Rio’s heart gave a hard, unexpected thud.

She turned back to the conversation too quickly.

“Is everything quite well, Professor?” Wanda asked, too smoothly.

“Perfectly,” Rio replied, voice light. “I was just… thinking.”

Wanda’s brow lifted ever so slightly, but she said nothing more.

A few minutes later, Rio excused herself under the pretense of needing air.

She stepped onto the terrace, the cool breeze biting at her face—steady, grounding.

She let out a slow breath.

Control yourself, Vidal. You’ve lived like this for years. What difference is one sharp-eyed governess going to make?

“Running away, Professor?”

Rio froze.

She turned slowly to find Agatha standing a few paces behind her, gloved hands clasped at her waist. Her expression was calm, almost amused.

“Just needed a moment,” Rio said carefully.

Agatha stepped forward—not close enough to crowd, but close enough that Rio could feel the intent behind it.

“To breathe… or to avoid being studied?” Agatha asked softly.

Rio’s throat tightened.

She managed a quiet smile. “Do I seem like a creature worth studying, Miss Harkness?”

Agatha’s eyes didn’t waver. “Perhaps.”

For a moment, neither of them spoke. The wind stirred the edges of Agatha’s gown, pulled a strand of hair loose from Rio’s tie.

And then—

Agatha gave a slight, almost imperceptible tilt of her head. “I wonder what else I might discover if I kept watching.”

The words landed with quiet precision.

Rio swallowed hard, fighting the instinct to step back. “Some things aren’t meant to be discovered.”

Agatha’s lips curved, just faintly. “I find those are often the most interesting.”

And with that, she turned and slipped back into the house—leaving Rio alone on the terrace, heart hammering and walls suddenly feeling far too thin.


=======
The visit had lingered into the late afternoon, the kind of soft, golden hour when London’s sharp edges softened beneath a veil of light.

Agatha had played her role perfectly—charming but not too familiar, attentive but not cloying. She had offered tea, engaged in light conversation, and expertly sidestepped every attempt Wanda made to leave her alone with Rio.

Until now.

The moment the guests began to drift toward the foyer, Agatha stood, smoothing the dark fabric of her skirts.

“I believe the garden is still bearable in this light,” she said lightly, turning to Rio with a pleasant, unreadable smile. “Would you care for a walk, Professor?”

Rio blinked—just enough for Agatha to catch it.

A lady did not invite a gentleman for a walk. Not alone. Not unchaperoned. It was an unspoken rule, ironclad in every social circle that mattered.

And Agatha had asked as though it was nothing at all.

Rio inclined her head with only a slight hesitation. “If it would please you.”

Careful, Agatha noted. Not yes. Not no. A measured middle.

“Very much,” Agatha replied, her voice smooth. She turned toward the terrace doors, half-glancing back. “Unless, of course, you’re concerned about appearances.”

There. A perfectly baited hook.

She watched as Rio’s jaw tensed for the briefest moment before smoothing back into that practiced calm.

“I find appearances are often misleading,” Rio said quietly.

Agatha’s smile sharpened. “Indeed.”

She stepped onto the terrace, letting the soft click of her heels on the stone mark each step—and listened as Rio followed.

The garden lay stretched out before them, quiet, private. The kind of setting where a man might lead a lady on his arm.

But not today.

Agatha let her gloved hand brush the edge of the low stone wall beside them. “I must admit… I wasn’t certain you’d accept.”

Rio met her gaze. “Why?”

Agatha’s smile didn’t waver. “I find most men are less inclined to let a woman take the lead.”

Rio held her eyes a heartbeat too long before replying. “Perhaps I’m not most men.”

No, Agatha thought, her heart quickening in a way she refused to name. You are not.

They walked side by side in silence for a few moments, the gravel crunching softly beneath their steps.

Agatha didn’t press. Not yet. She let the silence stretch just long enough to see if Rio would break it first.

And when she didn’t…

Agatha’s fingers trailed lightly along the stone wall, voice soft. “Tell me, Professor… what other rules do you find yourself willing to break?”
=======
They walked a few quiet steps more, the hush of the garden folding around them.

At Agatha’s question, Rio gave a soft, almost self-deprecating laugh.

“Most rules, Miss Harkness,” she said, glancing sideways at her. “Are written by men who have no idea what it costs to follow them.”

It was smooth. Perfectly delivered. The kind of answer that would charm any sharp-witted woman into dropping her guard.

Any woman but Agatha.

Agatha arched a brow, letting a faint smile tug at her lips. “A convenient philosophy.”

Rio’s smile held. “It’s served me well enough.”

Agatha nodded, almost as if agreeing—then deliberately reached out and laid her hand lightly on Rio’s arm.

Not a mere touch. Not accidental. A poised, unmistakable gesture.

The sort a lady would never initiate… unless she meant to be noticed.

She felt the subtle shift beneath her fingers—the faintest tension in Rio’s frame. Not surprise. Not offense. But something sharper. A flash of instinct Rio masked almost as soon as it surfaced.

Agatha kept her expression serene. “And yet here you are… following my lead.”

Rio’s gaze flickered—just for a moment—before softening back into that composed smile.

“I suppose,” Rio said quietly, “some rules are worth breaking for the right company.”

Agatha let her hand linger a heartbeat longer before she withdrew, stepping slightly ahead toward the hedge-lined path.

There it is, she thought. You’re playing a part, Professor.

But so was she.

And this game was only beginning.
=======
Agatha didn’t let go.

Instead, after that brief moment of contact, she slipped her hand neatly into the crook of Rio’s arm—settling there with the kind of quiet, effortless confidence that would make it impossible for Rio to step away without drawing attention to it.

And Rio—after the slightest pause—adjusted, matching her stride to Agatha’s.

They moved together along the path, far closer than propriety allowed, as if they had done this a hundred times before.

Agatha let the silence settle again before speaking, her voice low but steady.

“I imagine you find it rather tedious… navigating a world where every action is dictated by expectation.”

She felt, rather than saw, the slight shift in Rio’s posture. “I’ve learned to ignore most of it.”

“Have you?” Agatha gave a soft, almost teasing hum. “I wonder. Men are expected to lead, to take charge… yet here you are—following along while a woman leads you through a garden. Some might consider that… unbecoming.”

Rio chuckled softly. “And do you consider it unbecoming, Miss Harkness?”

Agatha tilted her head slightly, her hand still resting comfortably against Rio’s arm. “No. I find it interesting.”

Rio gave a low, thoughtful hum. “I suppose I’ve always believed a person’s worth isn’t measured by how loudly they assert it.”

Agatha let her gaze drift up toward Rio’s profile—calm, composed, just the faintest tension at the corner of her mouth.

“And yet,” Agatha murmured, “you assert yourself rather carefully. Almost… as though you’re afraid of giving too much away.”

Rio’s step faltered—just for a moment. A half-beat.

Then she laughed quietly, a warm sound that didn’t quite mask the sharpness beneath it.

“Perhaps,” Rio said softly, “we all have something we’d rather not give away.”

Agatha smiled—genuine, soft, but edged with something knowing.

“Oh, Professor,” she murmured. “That’s the first sensible thing you’ve said all afternoon.”

And she didn’t miss the way Rio’s breath caught—so slight it might have gone unnoticed by anyone else.

But not by her.

Never by her.
=======
They continued along the garden path, the hedge shielding them from the house—privacy Agatha used with quiet precision.

She leaned in just slightly, keeping her hand secure on Rio’s arm. Her voice softened, losing its teasing edge.

“I imagine,” she said carefully, “you’ve become quite practiced at pretending.”

Rio’s shoulders tensed—but not in alarm. It was more controlled… like a muscle tightening in anticipation of a blow that never came.

Agatha let her gaze drift ahead, her tone deceptively light. “Pretending to be exactly what they expect of you. Careful. Reserved. Almost as if… you don’t quite believe it yourself.”

Rio exhaled slowly, the kind of breath one takes before replying with something rehearsed. But before she could speak—

“Enjoying the afternoon?”

Wanda’s voice floated toward them, soft, pleasant—carrying across the trimmed lawn with the ease of someone who had definitely been watching for some time.

They both turned.

Wanda stood just outside the garden archway, hands folded loosely before her, expression serene… except for the faint, unmistakable glint of interest in her eyes.

Her gaze dropped—very deliberately—to where Agatha’s hand still rested on Rio’s arm.

Then drifted back up with a look that was far too mild to be casual.

Agatha offered a slow, composed smile. “A lovely afternoon. Professor Vidal was kind enough to indulge me with a walk.”

Wanda inclined her head. “How gracious.”

Her tone was warm. Almost fond. But there was a thread beneath it—quietly protective, gently warning.

Agatha felt her lips curve ever so slightly. Ah.

Wanda wasn’t just watching. She was weighing.

Rio answered with perfect calm. “It’s been… enlightening.”

Wanda gave her a quiet, unreadable look—then nodded once. “I’m pleased.”

And without another word, she turned and disappeared back toward the house, her skirts sweeping softly over the stone.

Agatha watched her go, her fingers slipping—slowly, deliberately—from Rio’s arm.

She could feel Rio’s eyes on her.

But for once, Agatha didn’t look back.

She simply smiled to herself… and followed Wanda inside.
=======
Wanda had seen many things from her parlor window.

But watching Agatha Harkness slip her hand into Professor Vidal’s arm—and walk with him, step for step, through the garden—
That was… unexpected.

Wanda sipped her tea slowly, standing just beyond the curtain.

It wasn’t the impropriety that caught her attention. She’d long stopped expecting Agatha to follow the usual rules.

It was the way they moved together. Like two people circling a conversation neither wanted to start. Like two secrets holding hands beneath a layer of silk gloves.

Wanda’s gaze lingered on Rio—
How carefully she moved beside Agatha. How guarded.

Not like a man courting a woman.
More like a woman hoping not to be seen for what she really was.

Wanda’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Curious.

She waited until they neared the house before stepping forward, schooling her expression into something serene—choosing that precise moment to speak.
=======
The sun hung low on the horizon by the time Rio made her polite farewells.

The visit had ended as respectably as it had begun—tea, conversation, a few too-sharp glances from Wanda, and the ever-present hum of something unspoken winding tighter between her and Agatha with every passing moment.

Agatha stepped into the entryway as Rio reached for her coat, her movements composed as ever.

“I’ll see you out.”

It wasn’t a question.

Rio’s lips twitched faintly. “That seems to be becoming a habit.”

Agatha met her gaze, expression smooth as polished glass. “Does that bother you?”

Rio slid her arms into her coat, glancing down only long enough to fasten the buttons—steady hands, controlled breath, you’re fine, Vidal.

“Not at all,” she said quietly. “I’ve never minded the company of a woman with a talent for taking the lead.”

Agatha stepped closer—just slightly, enough to shrink the polite distance between them.

Her voice dropped, soft as a thread of silk. “Good. I wouldn’t want you to think I’m playing at something I’m not.”

Rio met her eyes—dark, sharp, impossible to read.

“Nor would I,” Rio murmured.

For a moment, they stood there in the hush of the entryway, words balanced on the edge of something neither dared push further.

Agatha gave a soft, sardonic smile. “I imagine I’ll be seeing you again, Professor.”

Rio inclined her head. “I imagine you will.”

And then, with a slight bow and a look that lingered just a heartbeat too long, Rio turned and stepped out into the evening air.

Agatha watched her go—watched until the sharp line of Rio’s coat disappeared into the deepening dusk.

Only then did she allow herself a slow, measured exhale.

What exactly are you hiding, Professor Vidal?

And why, Agatha wondered—not for the first time—did she so desperately want to find out?
=======
Two days later

Agatha had nearly convinced herself the last encounter had been a passing curiosity.

A moment of shared defiance between two people living against the grain. Harmless. Forgettable.

Except… she hadn’t forgotten.

And apparently, neither had Wanda.

“You’ll accompany us tomorrow,” Wanda said lightly as she folded a letter at her writing desk. “The boys have been invited to the botanical exhibition. Vision thought it would be a fine educational outing.”

Agatha raised a brow. “I was unaware I now serve as chaperone to professors as well as unruly twins.”

Wanda gave her a slow, serene smile. “Professor Vidal will be attending. Vision invited him personally.”

Agatha’s eyes narrowed. “Did he.”

Wanda offered no further explanation—because of course she didn’t.

And Agatha realized then…

She wasn’t imagining things.

Wanda knew exactly what she was doing.

At that exact moment across the city, Rio sat at her desk in the dim light of her study, reading Vision’s invitation for the fourth time.

An informal outing. Good company. The boys will enjoy it.

Rio leaned back in her chair, drumming her fingers against the polished wood.

Vision had included a casual note at the bottom.

Wanda insists Agatha attend. She thought you’d appreciate the company.

Rio stared at the words, heart sinking in a way she refused to admit was anything but mild inconvenience.

Brilliant.

The one woman she couldn’t stop thinking about.

And she was about to spend an entire afternoon pretending they were nothing more than acquaintances.

What could possibly go wrong?
=======
The glasshouse was stifling.

Or perhaps that was simply Agatha’s mood.

She stood near a display of exotic ferns, the twins darting between exhibits under Wanda’s nominal supervision, and caught herself doing precisely what she’d promised she wouldn’t—

Watching him.

Professor Vidal stood across the conservatory, engaged in polite conversation with Vision and another gentleman Agatha didn’t recognize. His stance was relaxed, one hand tucked behind his back, posture precise… too precise.

Everything about him—or her, Agatha reminded herself in the privacy of her thoughts—felt careful.
Like armor stitched into skin.

And still—

Still.

When Rio laughed at some remark, soft and genuine, Agatha felt her chest tighten in a way she hadn’t expected and certainly didn’t welcome.

Stop it.

She had spent her life knowing exactly who she was—and who she wanted. There was safety in that certainty. She could explain it to herself, defend it to others, and use it to build the walls she needed to survive.

Men—real men—held no power over her heart.

Except now…

She watched the way Rio’s fingers brushed a leaf as he passed, lingering lightly. Not the casual touch of a man who moved through the world without fear, but something more… careful. Thoughtful.

What are you?

A puzzle, that was all.

Agatha folded her arms, gaze narrowing.

A man too soft to be believable—
Or a woman hiding in plain sight?

And if it was the latter…

Why did that thought make something in her twist, sharp and breathless, in a way she couldn’t name?

“Fascinating specimen,” Rio’s voice said quietly, just behind her.

Agatha turned—he was closer than she’d realized.

Rio gestured lightly to the plant beside them, a dark green vine curling against the glass. “It adapts to its surroundings. Changes color depending on what shades grow nearby.”

Agatha arched a brow. “A mimic.”

Rio’s smile was soft. “A survivor.”

Their eyes met—and for a heartbeat, it wasn’t about the plant at all.

Agatha held his gaze, pulse steady. “I suppose some things aren’t meant to thrive in the open.”

Rio’s smile didn’t falter. “Or perhaps they’ve simply learned the cost of being seen.”

Agatha felt something low and sharp twist in her stomach.

What are you hiding?

And why, Agatha wondered—not for the first time—did the answer feel like it might destroy them both?
=======
They wandered deeper into the glasshouse after that, conversation drifting toward safer topics—rare plants, botanical myths, the absurdity of London social circles.

But even with words hanging politely between them, Agatha could feel it—
That taut, invisible thread stretched between herself and Rio, tightening with every shared glance.

She wasn’t imagining it.

And she wasn’t entirely sure she wanted it to stop.

She let her hand brush lightly against Rio’s sleeve as they passed a low stone planter—watching, noting the quick flicker of breath Rio took, sharp and silent.

And then—

“Professor!”

Thomas’s voice broke through the air like a stone through glass.

They both turned.

Thomas stood by a low bench, hands on his hips, eyes narrowed in exaggerated suspicion.

“Professor,” he called again, striding toward them with all the unearned confidence of a boy who had never been told no, “are you hiding something?”

Agatha felt Rio stiffen at her side.

She forced her expression smooth, though her heart kicked sharply against her ribs.

“Thomas Maximoff,” she said coolly, “must you interrogate every guest within ten feet of you?”

Thomas ignored her entirely. He planted himself squarely in front of Rio, arms crossed.

“It’s just—” he began, glancing up at Rio’s face with a knowing smirk. “You don’t seem like the other professors.”

Agatha arched a brow. “What precisely does that mean?”

Thomas shrugged. “I dunno. You don’t talk down to people. Or try to sound smarter than everyone.” He leaned forward, squinting dramatically. “And you’re nicer. Like… not a normal man.”

Agatha caught the sharp inhale Rio took—and saw, in the space of a heartbeat, the practiced mask slide firmly back into place.

Rio gave a soft, easy chuckle. “I suppose I’ll have to work on my arrogance, won’t I?”

Thomas grinned. “Yeah, you should.”

And with that, he spun around and darted off after his brother.

Agatha let the silence settle thick between them before she spoke—her voice low, just enough for Rio to hear.

“Out of the mouths of babes.”

Rio turned to her, calm and composed. But Agatha didn’t miss the faint tension in her jaw.

“Children do have a way of seeing things adults overlook,” Rio said softly.

Agatha met her eyes, gaze steady. “They do.”

And for the first time, she saw something flicker in Rio’s expression—something dangerously close to surrender.

But Rio only gave a faint, unreadable smile.

“Shall we catch up with them?”

Agatha didn’t answer right away.

Because she wasn’t entirely sure whether she wanted to catch up… or stay exactly where they were, standing toe-to-toe on the edge of a truth neither of them was ready to speak aloud.
=======
The rest of the exhibition passed in a blur of polite conversation, botanical trivia, and Wanda occasionally casting Agatha a look that hovered somewhere between amusement and warning.

But Agatha was already thinking two steps ahead.

By the time the outing drew to a close, she had her plan in place.

As they prepared to leave—Vision wrangling the boys, Wanda politely fending off a cluster of chatty acquaintances—Agatha turned toward Rio, her expression carefully pleasant.

“I find myself with the rare gift of an unscheduled afternoon tomorrow,” she said lightly, folding her gloves neatly in her hands. “And I’ve been meaning to see the new sculpture exhibit at the academy.”

Rio arched a brow, polite and cautious. “A fine display, I’m sure.”

Agatha tilted her head slightly, voice lowering just enough to shift the air between them.

“I dislike going alone.”

There it was—clear, direct, impossible to mistake.

Not an invitation made under the protection of Wanda’s watchful eyes.
Not a casual inclusion in a group outing.

A private engagement.

And Agatha watched, sharp and still, as Rio’s composure flickered for the barest instant—caught between instinctive retreat and the impossibility of refusal.

“I’d be honored,” Rio said smoothly.

Agatha smiled, soft and knowing. “Excellent.”

She stepped slightly closer, dropping her voice to a soft murmur.

“Do bring your best mask, Professor. I intend to watch very carefully.”

Rio’s eyes met hers, steady… but not unreadable. Not this time.

Agatha saw it—the crack in the armor. The shadow of something Rio couldn’t quite hide.

Good.

She smiled sweetly, offered a polite nod, and turned away before Rio could reply.

She could feel Rio’s gaze follow her long after she walked away.
=======
Rio pulled off her cravat with a little too much force the moment she stepped into her flat.

It fell to the chair in a crumpled heap. She stared at it—at the neat folds and precise knotting that had kept her shielded all afternoon—and wondered if it would even matter soon.

What are you doing?

She pressed her palms to the edge of the washbasin, gripping hard enough to make her knuckles ache.

This wasn’t supposed to happen.

She was supposed to play the part—smile, speak carefully, walk the razor’s edge between too much and too little. It was survival. It was who she was.

But then…

“Do bring your best mask, Professor.”

Agatha’s words echoed back to her, soft as a whisper, sharp as a knife.

And Rio felt it again—that sick, twisting pull in her chest.

Because Agatha wasn’t fooled.
And Rio… didn’t know if she wanted her to be.

She could still walk away. She could decline the invitation. Claim a lecture, a prior engagement, an illness. The script was familiar. She’d lived it before.

But…

What if she told the truth?

What if she peeled back the careful layers and let Agatha see the real woman behind the mask?

Would Agatha laugh? Would she pity her? Would she—

Be disgusted?

That thought hit harder than Rio wanted to admit.

Because it wasn’t fear of scandal that hollowed her out in that moment.
It was fear of losing whatever it was that had been sparking between them from the start.

She’d known this would happen eventually.

She just hadn’t thought it would happen with her.

With Agatha.

Rio closed her eyes, bracing herself against the cold porcelain.

God help me… I don’t know if I want her to stop looking.
=======
The next morning dawned clear and cold, the kind of brittle London morning that should have sharpened Rio’s senses.

Instead, she stood before the mirror, fastening her cravat with practiced fingers, repeating the lie she had been telling herself since the moment Agatha extended the invitation.

This will be the last time.

One final polite outing. One last careful performance.
She would walk beside Agatha, exchange a few clever remarks, and then leave—distant, controlled, forgettable.

And after that… she would step back.

Because this was getting too close.
And she wasn’t sure if Agatha’s attention thrilled her or terrified her more.

Rio tied the last knot with a sharp pull.

You can’t afford this.

If the truth came out—if Agatha recoiled, if Wanda turned cold, if Vision’s strange, quiet friendship soured—everything Rio had built would collapse.

And yet…

She let her eyes drift to her reflection.

The mask sat perfectly in place. Dark coat. Crisp collar. Confident stance.
But the woman beneath it?

She wasn’t sure if she wanted to protect herself—
Or be seen.

With a slow, steadying breath, Rio picked up her gloves and slipped them on.

One more time, she told herself.
One last time.

And if she said it enough… maybe she’d believe it.
=======
The Academy was quiet in the late morning hours—its halls polished, its exhibits pristine, and its visitors scarce.

Agatha had timed it perfectly.

She arrived precisely when she intended—early enough to claim the space, late enough that Rio couldn’t suggest they join a group.

When Rio arrived, dressed as impeccably as ever in dark wool and a high-collared coat, Agatha greeted her with a slow, measured smile.

“Professor Vidal,” she murmured. “I’m pleased you came.”

Rio offered a slight bow. “It’s a pleasure, Miss Harkness.”

Agatha took that in with a faint hum, letting her eyes linger on Rio’s face a beat longer than propriety allowed.

Good, she thought. Keep your composure. Let’s see how long it lasts.

They wandered the first few rooms in comfortable silence—examining marble busts, ancient tablets, intricate carvings. Agatha let the distance between them close in slow, natural increments.

A light brush of shoulders as they examined a sculpture.
A quiet step closer when Rio commented on the craftsmanship.

All perfectly appropriate.
All very intentional.

It wasn’t until they entered the north gallery—a quiet hall lined with classical figures—that Agatha spoke softly, her voice low and edged with curiosity.

“Do you ever tire of pretending?”

Rio’s head turned sharply.

Agatha let her gaze drift over the marble figures. “Society expects us to behave a certain way… say the right words, offer the correct glances, wear the proper masks. Doesn’t it exhaust you?”

Rio recovered quickly—far too quickly. “I imagine we all pretend a little.”

Agatha tilted her head, her smile soft but sharp. “Some of us more than others.”

A pause.

Rio’s lips curved faintly, but her hands tensed at her sides. “And you?”

Agatha stepped closer—casual, deliberate. “I’ve never been fond of pretending. Though I do make the occasional exception… when it’s worth it.”

Their eyes locked.

Rio’s breath caught—subtle, controlled, but there.

Agatha smiled, tilting her chin slightly. “Are you worth it, I wonder?”

For a heartbeat, Rio said nothing.

Then—quietly—“That’s a dangerous question, Miss Harkness.”

Agatha’s smile softened. “I’m rather fond of dangerous questions.”

And for the first time, she saw it—
The crack.
The mask faltered.

Not gone.
Not yet.

But slipping, inch by inch.
=======
They drifted toward a statue in the center of the gallery—
A marble depiction of a Roman heroine, sword in hand, gaze fierce, body carved with all the sharp edges men pretended women didn’t have.

Agatha let her fingers trail lightly along the base, her voice soft.

“She fought dressed as a man… to win battles no man thought a woman could.”

Rio gave a low hum. “I know the story.”

Agatha turned her head, smiling faintly. “Do you?”

Rio nodded. “She was clever. She hid in plain sight. They never suspected.”

Agatha tilted her head, stepping close—close enough that the hem of her sleeve brushed Rio’s. “And what do you suppose would have happened if someone had seen through her disguise?”

Rio’s lips parted—just slightly.

“I imagine…” she began, then hesitated.

Agatha leaned in, lowering her voice to a near whisper. “You imagine?”

Rio swallowed. “She’d have had to trust that… someone would understand.”

There.

There.

Agatha felt it—a slight, unconscious shift. The faintest breath of softness in Rio’s voice, a subtle drop in the weight behind her words.

Not something a man trying to hold his ground would say.
Not something a man pretending to be a gentleman would admit.

And then—

As they turned together toward the next sculpture, Rio reached out instinctively—her gloved hand brushing against Agatha’s wrist, light, cautious… fingers curling ever so slightly in a gesture of steadying her.

Not a man’s touch.

A woman’s.

Deliberate. Careful. Protective.

Agatha caught her wrist gently, holding it in place for just a moment too long.

Rio stilled.

Agatha lifted her gaze—met Rio’s eyes fully—and smiled.

Slow. Sure. Pleased.

I see you.

And she watched, heart racing, as Rio’s eyes widened the smallest fraction—her mask cracking, falling back into place too late.

Agatha released her wrist with a soft hum.

“Well,” she said lightly, stepping forward. “How very… enlightening.”

And she felt the heat coil low in her chest—not the sharp bite of suspicion, nor the cold thrill of victory—

But something warmer.

Something entirely her own.
=======
Rio didn’t move right away.

Her hand hovered half-curled at her side, the skin beneath her glove buzzing with the ghost of Agatha’s touch.

She swallowed hard—
And caught herself staring.

Agatha smiled faintly, turning back toward the gallery path as if nothing at all had happened.

But Rio felt it—
The ground shifting beneath her careful footing.

She had slipped.
And Agatha… knew.

Her heart pounded in her throat. She braced herself for a cutting remark, for a carefully veiled accusation.

But instead—

Agatha glanced over her shoulder, voice low and even. “It’s rather close in here, don’t you think?”

Rio blinked. “I—”

Agatha offered a soft, serene smile. “Walk with me. I find the air outside far preferable to stifling galleries and stifling expectations.”

There was nothing in her tone to suggest malice. No sharpness. No threat.

Just… invitation.

And somehow, that was worse.

Because Rio didn’t know if Agatha meant it as mercy—
Or a test she was about to fail.

She managed a careful nod. “Of course.”

Agatha waited until Rio fell in step beside her before she spoke again, her tone light but edged with something warmer than Rio expected.

“Besides…” Agatha murmured, “I find the city far more bearable when one isn’t constantly pretending.”

Rio’s breath hitched—soft, sharp, almost inaudible.

But Agatha heard it. She didn’t so much as glance over.

She simply reached out again—this time resting her hand lightly against Rio’s arm as they walked through the marble archway into the sun.

A touch soft enough to seem friendly.
Steady enough to remind Rio of precisely who was leading this game now.

And if Agatha felt the faint tremor in Rio’s frame?

She said nothing at all.
=======
Rio couldn’t remember the last time she’d been this careful.

Every step beside Agatha felt like balancing on the edge of a blade—smiling when she should, replying in measured tones, matching Agatha’s pace as though this were nothing more than a friendly stroll through London’s bustling streets.

But inside?

Inside she was coming undone.

She could still feel the echo of Agatha’s hand on her arm.
The deliberate, maddening softness of it.
Like an anchor… or a leash.

She couldn’t decide which.

Rio risked a glance at the woman walking beside her.

Agatha moved with that same calm, self-possessed grace she always carried—head high, expression smooth, a faint, knowing curve to her lips.

Not sharp. Not cruel.
But aware.

And that awareness twisted something sharp and hot in Rio’s chest.

She knows.

She doesn’t know everything—not yet. But enough.

Enough to hold it in her hands like a secret neither of them wanted to speak aloud.

Rio’s heart beat harder with every block they crossed.
She tried to reason with herself—
Tried to summon the cool, logical detachment that had kept her alive all these years.

But every carefully rehearsed thought fell apart under the weight of one terrifying question:

What if she doesn’t hate me?

What if this isn’t disgust?
What if it’s… curiosity?

And worse—what if it’s something Rio had been foolish enough to want?

Agatha turned slightly, her eyes catching Rio’s as they paused at a narrow crossing.

Her voice was light, almost teasing. “You’re unusually quiet, Professor. Dare I hope I’ve finally rendered you speechless?”

Rio felt something almost laugh—dry and tight—rise in her throat.

“I suppose there’s a first time for everything.”

Agatha’s eyes lingered a beat longer than they should have.
And in them, Rio thought she saw it—
That glint of something dangerous… and maybe, impossibly, kind.

God help me, Rio thought, forcing her breath steady as they resumed their walk,
I don’t know if I’m terrified of losing this… or terrified of wanting it more.
=======
They reached the Maximoff townhouse just as the afternoon sun began to slip behind the chimneys, casting long shadows over the cobbled street.

Rio slowed as they approached the steps, already shaping her polite goodbye.

“It’s been—” she began, voice smooth, practiced—

“Do come in for tea,” Agatha said lightly, stepping ahead of her toward the door.

Rio blinked. “I wouldn’t want to impose.”

Agatha turned, her expression calm—almost amused. “You’re hardly imposing, Professor.”

Rio opened her mouth. “Truly, I—”

Agatha tilted her head, that serene, maddening smile curving at the edges. “Are you afraid of being alone with me?”

Rio’s throat went dry.

Agatha held her gaze for a breath—
Then turned the latch and pushed the door open.

“No one’s home,” she said over her shoulder, voice smooth as silk. “The boys are at their lessons, and Wanda took Vision to some wretched society function.”

She stepped inside without waiting for an answer.

And Rio—heart hammering, pulse roaring in her ears—followed.

The door clicked shut behind them, the quiet of the house folding in around them like velvet.

Agatha didn’t lead her toward the parlor.
Didn’t call for tea.

Instead, she set her gloves neatly on the entry table, turned—
And looked at Rio with a softness edged in something sharper.

“You’ve been running from something,” Agatha said quietly.

Rio froze.

Agatha stepped forward, slow, deliberate. “I’m not asking what it is.”

Rio opened her mouth—

Agatha lifted a hand. “I’m asking why you think I’d care.”

The words landed soft… and devastating.

Because for the first time since this dangerous game began, Rio felt the air shift—
Not with threat.

With permission.

Agatha stood before her, unflinching.
Not accusing.
Not prying.
Just… waiting.

Like she already knew.
And wasn’t going anywhere.

Rio’s heart twisted.

She swallowed hard. “Because if you knew…”

Agatha took the final step forward, voice soft—dangerously soft.

“I do know.”

And there, in the hush of the Maximoff foyer, Agatha reached out—slow, careful—
And brushed her fingers lightly beneath Rio’s chin.

“Now,” Agatha whispered, eyes dark and steady, “are you going to keep pretending… or are you going to show me who you really are?”=======

=======
Rio’s breath caught.

She held perfectly still, heart thudding hard enough she was certain Agatha could hear it.

This was it.
The moment every instinct told her to fold her cards, retreat, apologize—
Lie.

But then Agatha’s hand fell away—light, deliberate.
And she gave a soft, almost self-deprecating laugh.

“I should have known sooner,” Agatha murmured.

Rio blinked. “What?”

Agatha met her eyes—steady, sharp, knowing.

“There’s no possible way I could feel this,” Agatha said quietly, “for a man.”

The words landed like a blow.

Rio felt her pulse stutter, breath catching in her throat.

She opened her mouth—
Closed it.

Agatha arched a brow, stepping just close enough that Rio could feel the heat between them.

“You’ve been careful,” Agatha said softly. “Very careful.”

Her voice dropped lower.

“But I know what a woman looks like when she’s waiting to be seen.”

Rio’s throat worked, her mask threatening to splinter.

“I…” she managed, forcing a thin, practiced smile. “I don’t know what you think you’ve seen—”

Agatha leaned in, her lips almost grazing Rio’s ear.

“I see you.”

Rio closed her eyes, the last thread of her composure unraveling in a slow, aching pull.

But even as the panic flared, so did something else—
Something sharp, hot, and terrifyingly welcome.

Relief.

And want.

God help me…

When she opened her eyes, Agatha was still there—watching, waiting.

Rio swallowed hard.

“I don’t know how to stop,” she whispered, voice raw.

Agatha smiled, slow and devastating.

“Then don’t.”
=======
For a heartbeat, neither of them moved.

Rio stood frozen—caught between instinct and something she couldn’t name—her breath shallow, her pulse a frantic staccato beneath skin gone too warm.

Agatha met her eyes, gaze steady and impossibly soft.

And then—without ceremony, without warning—

Agatha reached up, cupped Rio’s face in her gloved hand, and kissed her.

It wasn’t hard.
Wasn’t rushed.

It was slow—deliberate.

A quiet claiming.

As if Agatha had decided long before this moment and was only now giving herself permission.

The contact sent a sharp bolt of heat straight through Rio’s chest—
Burning away everything she’d been holding back.

Her hands came up instinctively—halfway to Agatha’s arms—
Then froze, hovering, unsure whether to pull her closer or push her away.

But Agatha didn’t pull back.

She kissed her like it was nothing at all… and everything at once.

Soft, sure, certain.

When she finally drew back—just slightly—Agatha’s lips brushed against Rio’s as she spoke, low and steady.

“I don’t care what name you wear.”

Rio’s eyes fluttered open, the words hitting like a punch to the ribs.

Agatha smiled—quiet, unshaken.

“I care who you are.”

And Rio…

For the first time in years…

Had no idea what to say.
=======
The world seemed to narrow around them—nothing but the soft hush of their breath and the space where Agatha’s hand still cradled Rio’s cheek.

Rio stayed perfectly still.

Not because she was afraid—
But because she didn’t trust herself not to fall apart entirely if she moved.

Agatha didn’t push.
Didn’t speak again.

She just… waited.

That steady, maddening patience.
The quiet certainty of a woman who had never chased anything in her life—because she didn’t have to.

And Rio felt it—
The truth humming between them, louder than the pounding of her heart.

She could walk away now.
She could lie.
She could pretend a little longer.

But then—

Agatha’s thumb brushed lightly against her jaw, soft and grounding.

And Rio…

Let go.

She closed the space between them in a single, sharp breath—
Her hand catching gently at Agatha’s waist as she kissed her back.

This kiss wasn’t soft.
Wasn’t polite.

It was a low, aching exhale of every fear, every want, every thread she’d been holding so tightly it burned.

Agatha met her without hesitation—leaning in, fingers curling against Rio’s jaw with a quiet, possessive steadiness.

When they finally pulled apart, Rio rested her forehead against Agatha’s, breath unsteady.

“I’m not who you think I am,” she whispered, voice rough, thick with everything she couldn’t hold in.

Agatha let out a soft, breathless laugh.

“Oh, Professor,” she murmured, eyes half-lidded, “you are exactly who I thought you were.”

And in that moment—just for that moment—
Rio stopped running.
=======
They stayed there—close, still, the charged air between them softening into something quieter, warmer.

Rio’s breath came slow, each one threading out into the space between them like she wasn’t sure if she’d ever catch it again.

Agatha brushed her thumb once more along Rio’s jaw before letting her hand fall gently away.

She stepped back—not far, just enough to leave Rio standing there in the hush of the foyer, heart laid bare and hands trembling slightly at her sides.

Agatha’s expression softened into something that made Rio’s chest ache in ways she didn’t understand.

And then—

“Perhaps,” Agatha said quietly, tilting her head just so, “it’s time for that tea and talk now… don’t you think?”

Her voice held no sharpness. No challenge.

Just calm, steady invitation.

Rio exhaled a soft, shaky breath—and, to her surprise, laughed.

A quiet, rough sound that pulled the tightest threads inside her a little looser.

“I… yes.” She swallowed hard, offering a small, helpless smile. “I think I’d like that.”

Agatha gave her a slow, approving nod.

“Good,” she murmured.

And with that, Agatha turned toward the parlor—expecting, trusting, knowing Rio would follow.

Rio watched her for a heartbeat, heart still racing…
And then she did.

For the first time, without the mask.
=======
The parlor felt different with no one else in it.

No Wanda’s quiet presence.
No Vision’s bookish hum.
No twins lurking just out of sight.

Just Agatha and Rio, separated by a low table and a steaming pot of tea Agatha poured herself—without asking—like it was the most natural thing in the world.

Rio sat perched on the edge of the settee, gloves discarded, hands folded loosely in her lap.

Agatha slid a cup toward her.

Rio took it with careful fingers.

The silence wasn’t tense.
It wasn’t exactly comfortable either.

It was… expectant.

Agatha took a sip of her tea, set the cup down neatly on its saucer, and folded her hands in her lap.

“Shall I begin,” she said softly, “or would you prefer to?”

Rio blinked. “You…?”

Agatha gave her a slow, measured look. “It seems to me we’ve both been carrying more truth than we’ve said aloud.”

Rio’s heart gave a low, heavy thud.

Agatha’s voice stayed calm. “I could tell you all the little things I’ve noticed—the ones I ignored for the sake of propriety. The ones I dismissed because… I thought perhaps I’d invented them to explain why I couldn’t stop noticing you.”

She leaned in slightly, eyes holding Rio’s.

“But I didn’t invent them. Did I?”

Rio stared down at the tea in her hands.

A long moment passed.

Then—soft, rough—
“No.”

Agatha sat back, exhaling softly.

“Good.”

Another pause.

Rio glanced up—nervous, but needing to know. “And… that doesn’t frighten you?”

Agatha smiled, faint and knowing. “It might have. Once. But I’ve lived too long behind walls to flinch when I meet someone else who built her own.”

Rio’s throat tightened.

She wanted to speak—wanted to explain—
But for once, words didn’t come easily.

Agatha tilted her head, watching her with something too soft to be pity and too steady to be mere curiosity.

“You don’t have to tell me everything today,” Agatha said gently. “But I think it’s time you told me something.”

Rio closed her eyes for a moment—
And let the first thread of truth slip past her lips.

“My name… isn’t Rio Vidal.”

When she looked up, Agatha’s smile didn’t falter.

“Of course it isn’t.”
=======
The parlor settled around them in a soft hush, broken only by the faint clink of porcelain as Agatha set her untouched teacup aside.

She didn’t speak right away.

And Rio, heart tight in her chest, waited—half dreading, half hoping.

Agatha folded her hands in her lap, gaze fixed thoughtfully on the faint pattern of the carpet.

“I imagine,” she said softly, “you must think me terribly forward.”

Rio blinked. “I—”

Agatha looked up then—her expression calm, but her eyes sharp with something Rio wasn’t used to seeing in people who knew even a hint of the truth.

Recognition.

“I’ve never been good at… softening myself for the comfort of others,” Agatha said quietly. “It’s a habit I let die a long time ago. Along with any hope of being the kind of woman society expected me to be.”

She let the words settle between them like a slow exhale.

Rio swallowed hard, fingers curling lightly around her teacup.

Agatha’s lips quirked in a faint, dry smile. “I’ve known I wasn’t meant for men since I was old enough to be told I should be.”

Rio’s breath caught.

Agatha gave a soft hum. “I spent years assuming I’d be alone because of it. And I made my peace with that. I made my peace with… the pretense.”

Her gaze lifted—steady, unwavering—and locked on Rio’s.

“So if you think,” Agatha said softly, “that I’m here waiting for some confession that will change how I see you…”

She leaned in, her voice dropping low.

“You’re wrong.”

Rio felt her heart seize in her chest—sharp, breathless.

For a moment, she couldn’t speak.

Agatha sat back with a slow, deliberate ease, as though she hadn’t just undone the knot Rio had tied around her own heart.

“I only ask,” Agatha said gently, “that you don’t insult me by pretending you’re something you’re not. Not here. Not with me.”

Rio swallowed hard.

Her hands shook slightly as she set the teacup down with careful precision.

“My name is Rio,” she said quietly. “But… it’s short for Rosario.”

Agatha’s expression didn’t change—except for a soft, almost imperceptible warmth at the corner of her mouth.

“I thought it might be,” Agatha murmured.

And for the first time in what felt like years—

Rio didn’t feel afraid.
=======
They sat in the soft hush of the parlor for a moment longer—tea cooling between them, the quiet stretching not into awkwardness, but something… waiting.

Agatha rested her hands lightly in her lap, watching Rio with a calm, steady patience that somehow felt like an invitation and a dare at once.

“I imagine,” Agatha said softly, “there’s a story behind that choice.”

Not a question.
Not a demand.

Just a thread, held out between them.

Rio let out a soft, shaky laugh, one hand lifting to rub at the back of her neck.

“There is,” she admitted. “Though… I’m not sure if it’s the kind you’d expect.”

Agatha arched a brow, her smile soft but edged with curiosity. “Try me.”

Rio exhaled slowly, fingers knotting together.

“I didn’t… set out to build a life like this,” she began quietly. “Not at first.”

She glanced down at her hands.

“The first time was when I was seventeen. My brother had gotten himself tangled in a fight with a debt collector. I took his coat, cut my hair, and went to settle it myself—figured a man would be heard before a woman ever would.”

Agatha’s expression didn’t change—no shock, no disapproval.

Rio gave a soft huff. “It worked. A little too well.”

She looked up, met Agatha’s eyes.

“I realized… people listened. Doors opened. Opportunities I could never have dreamed of before.”

Her hands tightened slightly.

“And before I knew it, I wasn’t just stepping in for my brother. I was stepping into a world that would have locked me out if they’d known who I really was.”

Agatha nodded once, slow and understanding.

Rio swallowed. “At first, I thought I’d stop. I’d save enough, make my way somewhere quieter… live honestly.”

She gave a hollow laugh. “But then… I didn’t want to stop. I didn’t want to go back to being invisible.”

Agatha’s gaze softened—not with pity, but something deeper.

“And now?” she asked quietly. “Do you want to stop?”

Rio met her eyes—steady, bare.

“I don’t know,” she whispered. “I only know… I don’t want to lie to you.”

Agatha’s breath hitched just slightly, and Rio thought—hoped—she saw a flicker of something tender pass across her face.

Agatha reached for her teacup, her fingers brushing lightly against Rio’s hand as she did.

“Then don’t,” Agatha said softly.

And somehow… that made the knot in Rio’s chest loosen, just a little.
=======
The clink of porcelain was soft between them as Agatha set her cup down once more.

Rio watched the gentle curve of her fingers as they brushed the saucer’s edge—calm, deliberate, not a tremor in sight.

How could someone be so steady?

Rio folded her hands in her lap again, breathing slower now, though her heart still thrummed like a restless drumbeat in her chest.

Agatha leaned back slightly, studying her—not with the sharp, dissecting gaze of a woman picking apart a mystery—
But with a quiet, thoughtful warmth that made Rio’s breath catch.

For a long moment, neither spoke.

It felt… almost peaceful.

Then Agatha’s lips curved—soft, certain—and she broke the quiet in that same calm, confident voice.

“Is this what you want?”

Rio blinked, caught off guard. “What?”

Agatha’s eyes didn’t waver.

“This,” she said softly. “Not the pretense. Not the mask.”

Her gaze held Rio’s with unflinching steadiness.

“This. Me. You. Sitting here with no walls left to hide behind.”

Rio’s mouth went dry.

Agatha leaned forward just slightly—close enough that Rio felt the warmth of her presence, the gentle press of something that could so easily tip into something far more dangerous.

“Because if it is…” Agatha murmured, her voice dropping low, almost to a whisper, “I won’t let you pretend otherwise.”

Rio’s breath came shallow—sharp, aching.

She searched Agatha’s face for hesitation, for any flicker of uncertainty.

There wasn’t any.

Just Agatha. Steady. Certain. Herself.

And for the first time, Rio felt the tight coil of fear inside her start to give way to something else.

Need.

Want.

Relief.

“I—”

Her voice caught.

She swallowed, trying again.

“I think it is,” she whispered. “I think… I want you.”

Agatha’s smile curved—soft and dangerous all at once.

“Good,” she said gently.

And then—without waiting for permission, without asking for Rio’s walls to fall—

Agatha reached for her hand…
And didn’t let go.
=======
Rio stared down at their joined hands.

Agatha’s fingers curled lightly around hers—no pressure, no urgency.
Just… there.

Certain.
Steady.
Unshakable.

It was such a simple thing—
And yet it undid her more completely than any kiss, any whispered truth.

Rio felt her heart thrum harder, felt the warmth of Agatha’s hand seep into hers like it had been waiting there all along.

When she finally dared to look up, Agatha was watching her—
Soft, sure, patient… and entirely unafraid.

The weight of that almost made Rio tremble.

And then—

Agatha shifted forward, slow, deliberate.

Her other hand came up—lightly brushing a stray lock of Rio’s hair back behind her ear with a tenderness that felt nothing like pity and everything like want.

Their eyes held—
Breath mingling—
The silence humming louder than any words could have.

And Agatha kissed her.

Soft at first.

Barely a breath of contact.

But Rio—

Rio leaned in before she could stop herself—meeting her halfway, her hand tightening just slightly around Agatha’s.

This kiss wasn’t a slip, wasn’t a question.

It was a choice.

A slow, reverent meeting of lips that sent a slow, burning heat curling low in Rio’s chest—deep and quiet and real in a way she’d never dared to imagine.

When they parted, neither of them moved far.

Agatha’s forehead brushed gently against hers, her voice soft enough to be a secret.

“You’re not alone,” she whispered.

Rio exhaled slowly—
And for the first time in years…
She believed it.
=======
They stayed there in the hush of the parlor—hands still loosely joined, foreheads just touching, the air warm with everything unspoken now finally spoken.

Rio kept her eyes closed for a moment longer, breathing in the scent of tea and skin and something that might be safety.

When she finally drew back just enough to meet Agatha’s gaze again, her pulse had slowed…
But her heart hadn’t.

Agatha was watching her—
Not like a woman who had conquered something.
But like one who had chosen.

And then, in that same low, composed voice that had undone her so many times before, Agatha tilted her head slightly and said—

“Now that we’re no longer pretending…”

Rio blinked.

Agatha smiled faintly. “And since society offers us no proper script for what to do next—”

She leaned in, her voice low and entirely unbothered by the enormity of the question:

“Would you like to court me, Rosario?”

Rio’s breath caught—
And then, to her own surprise, she laughed.

Not mockingly. Not nervously.

Just… delighted.

A bright, startled sound that broke like sunlight across the room.

Agatha arched a brow. “Was that a no?”

Rio grinned, eyes warm and wide and utterly undone. “That was a God, yes—but also, you asking me? Bold.”

Agatha lifted her chin, all dry elegance. “Well. You’ve had your turn playing the gentleman. I thought I’d have mine.”

Rio’s grin softened—tipping into something vulnerable, something rare.

“I’d be honored,” she said quietly. “Truly.”

Agatha leaned forward, pressing another kiss—light, lingering—against the corner of her mouth.

“Good,” she murmured. “Because I plan to be very difficult to impress.”

Rio laughed again, this time quieter—more reverent.

And somewhere, in the quiet warmth of a borrowed home, two women who’d spent their lives outside the bounds of expectation began writing something entirely new. Together.
=======
They stayed seated side by side on the settee, the tea long forgotten, their hands still loosely intertwined atop the embroidered cushion.

For once, Rio wasn’t thinking of how she sat, how she spoke, how carefully she measured every breath.

She simply… was.

And Agatha let her be—her thumb tracing slow, idle patterns along the back of Rio’s hand, her gaze half-lidded in something softer than Rio had ever dared hope for.

A peace neither of them had known they’d wanted until it settled quietly between them.

“You’re different like this,” Agatha said after a long moment, her voice soft, unhurried.

Rio glanced over. “How so?”

Agatha gave a faint smile. “Quieter. Less… guarded.”

Rio huffed a soft laugh. “Maybe because for once, I’m not lying.”

Agatha’s smile deepened—not sharp, not smug. Just… pleased.

They sat in silence a moment longer—until the unmistakable sound of a door latch echoed faintly through the house.

Rio straightened instinctively.

Agatha didn’t move.

Moments later, Wanda’s voice floated lightly from the entryway.

“Agatha? I’m home.”

There was nothing in her tone—nothing suspicious, nothing expectant.

But Rio felt her heart climb into her throat anyway.

Agatha gave her hand a gentle squeeze, eyes dancing with something dangerously close to mischief.

“Relax,” she murmured. “We’ve nothing to hide now… have we?”

Rio managed a soft, shaky chuckle.

“No,” she whispered. “I suppose we don’t.”

And for the first time, when they stood together—shoulder to shoulder, hand brushing hand—
Rio didn’t flinch.

She met Wanda’s curious, knowing gaze in the doorway with her head held high…

And Agatha’s soft, steady hand resting just at her elbow.

No masks.
No lies.

Just them.


=======
Wanda stepped into the parlor with the graceful calm of a woman who already knew far more than anyone ever told her.

She took in the scene with a single sweep of her eyes—
Agatha, standing relaxed but close to Rio, hand still gently brushing her arm.
Rio, not retreating, not bracing, but standing steady beside her.

Wanda’s gaze lingered on their linked hands…
And then rose to meet Agatha’s with a faint, knowing smile.

“Well,” Wanda said softly, folding her gloves in her hands. “I did wonder how long it would take.”

Rio’s throat tightened.

Agatha, perfectly unbothered, arched a brow. “You knew?”

Wanda’s lips curved into something warm, edged with quiet pride.

“Agatha Harkness,” she murmured, “I’ve known you long enough to recognize when you’ve decided someone is yours.”

Agatha smirked—sharp and pleased. “Is that what I’ve done?”

Wanda’s eyes flicked to Rio then—softer, thoughtful.

“And you,” she said quietly. “I don’t know what you’ve been carrying… but I’m glad she found you before it broke you apart.”

Rio felt her chest ache—
Not from fear.

But from the unexpected weight of kindness.

She swallowed hard. “Thank you.”

Wanda gave a faint nod—serene, unruffled.

“Now,” she said lightly, stepping past them toward the hall, “I’ll pretend I didn’t see anything… for now.”

She paused at the doorway, glancing back over her shoulder with a slow, pointed smile.

“But if either of you hurts the other…”

Her expression softened into something fond.

“…I will be very disappointed.”

And with that, she disappeared into the hall—leaving silence and the faintest echo of amusement in her wake.

Agatha let out a soft, breathless laugh. “Well.”

Rio huffed a quiet, startled laugh of her own. “Well.”

They stood there a moment longer—
And for the first time since they’d met…

They both felt entirely, blessedly seen.
=======
In public…

They walked side by side through Hyde Park, a respectable distance between them, every step of Rio’s posture polished to perfection.

She carried her cane lightly, offered glances and nods to acquaintances with the practiced ease of a gentleman well-versed in society’s silent language.

Agatha walked beside her, composed and graceful in a high-collared walking dress of deep violet, her gloved hand resting lightly on Rio’s arm as they strolled.

To the world, it looked entirely proper.
A gentleman escorting a lady of respectable standing.

But only Rio noticed the slight pressure Agatha gave to her arm—subtle cues of when to slow, when to turn, when to stop and examine a flowerbed.

And every time Rio complied with that silent guidance, Agatha’s lips curved ever so slightly.

It became a game between them—
One no one else noticed.

The gentleman leading the lady… who was, in fact, following the lady’s unspoken lead.

Behind closed doors…

It was different.

At the Maximoff house, in quiet corners of the garden, or in Rio’s modest sitting room—

Agatha took the reins with no pretense at all.

She’d settle beside Rio, close enough their knees brushed, her hand resting lightly atop Rio’s.

And Rio… let her.

Not because she felt forced.

But because, for the first time, she wanted someone else to guide her.
Because with Agatha, she didn’t have to perform.

Agatha would lean in with that calm, wicked smile and say things like—

“Come here,” in a low, teasing murmur, curling her fingers into the front of Rio’s waistcoat.

Or—

“Sit with me,” softly commanding, as she patted the cushion beside her with a look that brooked no refusal.

And Rio would come.

Gladly.

Every time.

Because in a world that demanded she be something she wasn’t…
Agatha asked her only to be herself.
=======
It had been a wretched evening.

One of Vision’s academic colleagues—an aging, pompous man who made a habit of reminding everyone of his importance—
Had cornered Rio at a lecture reception, demanding her opinion on a recent policy change.

And when Rio gave it—
Measured, thoughtful, perfectly reasonable—
The man laughed.

Patted her shoulder.

And said, just loud enough to sting—

“Quite the soft-spoken gentleman you are, Vidal. You’ll want to speak with a bit more authority if you hope to be taken seriously.”

It wasn’t the first time.

But tonight, with Agatha just a few steps away, it hit differently.

By the time they slipped away from the reception and into the Maximoff parlor, Rio’s mask was still in place—
But cracked at the edges.

Agatha closed the door behind them with a soft, deliberate click.

Rio stood near the hearth, hands braced on the mantle, staring at the empty grate as though it might offer her answers she couldn’t give herself.

“I’m sorry,” she murmured after a long silence. “I shouldn’t have let it get to me.”

Agatha crossed the room slowly, her footsteps soft against the carpet.

“Why shouldn’t you?” she asked gently.

Rio let out a low, humorless laugh. “Because it’s nothing I haven’t heard before.”

She closed her eyes, gripping the mantle tighter. “Because I chose this. I chose to live this way.”

A soft touch brushed her back—
Light, careful, grounding.

“I imagine,” Agatha murmured near her shoulder, “that doesn’t make it hurt less.”

Rio let out a shaky breath.

“No,” she whispered. “It doesn’t.”

Agatha stepped closer, her hand settling firmly between Rio’s shoulder blades.

“Then let me carry it with you,” she said softly.

Rio’s throat tightened.

She turned, slowly, until they stood face to face—
And Agatha’s arms slid gently around her waist, drawing her close with quiet certainty.

Rio didn’t resist.

She let herself fold into the embrace—
Let Agatha hold her, steady and sure, the world narrowing to the soft, even sound of Agatha’s breath and the faint pressure of her arms.

No words.
No expectations.

Just… this.

And for once, Rio didn’t have to be strong.

She just had to be hers.
=======
They stayed like that for a long moment—Agatha’s arms wrapped around Rio, steady and unhurried, holding her without demand.

When Rio finally spoke, her voice was low, nearly a whisper against the curve of Agatha’s shoulder.

“I’m afraid,” she admitted.

Agatha didn’t flinch. “Of what?”

Rio exhaled slowly, her breath threading out between them.

“That one day… I’ll forget who I really am,” she whispered. “That I’ll be swallowed up by the role I’m playing.”

Agatha shifted slightly—just enough to lean back and meet Rio’s eyes.

Her hands slid from Rio’s back to her waist, her thumbs brushing slow, soothing arcs along her sides.

“You’re not a role,” Agatha said softly. “Not to me.”

Rio’s throat tightened again. “But I don’t even know if I’m—”

Agatha pressed a gentle finger to her lips, silencing her.

“You’re you,” Agatha murmured, her voice quiet but certain. “And I am not in love with a title, or a mask, or a name. I’m here for the woman standing in front of me… whether the world sees her or not.”

Rio closed her eyes, a soft, shaky laugh escaping her. “I don’t know what I did to deserve you.”

Agatha smiled faintly. “You survived.”

Rio opened her eyes—and this time, when she looked at Agatha, there was something softer there.

A fragile, rare kind of trust.

Agatha reached up, brushing her fingers lightly along Rio’s jaw.

“Come,” she said softly, tilting her head toward the settee. “Sit with me.”

It wasn’t a request.

It was a gentle command, one that made Rio’s heart twist in the best way.

She let Agatha guide her to the settee, their fingers intertwining once more as they sat side by side—closer than propriety allowed, closer than Rio would’ve dared with anyone else.

No masks.
No roles.
No lies.

Just Agatha.
And Rio.
And the quiet certainty of belonging—finally, irrevocably—to each other.
=======
They sat in the soft hush of the parlor—Rio pressed close against Agatha’s side, her hand resting lightly atop Agatha’s where their fingers had twined together.

The world outside might as well have ceased to exist.

For a long time, neither of them spoke.

It wasn’t uncomfortable.

It was… safe.

Finally, Rio took a slow breath and said, almost too softly—

“My father died when I was fifteen.”

Agatha turned slightly, her gaze softening.

Rio kept her eyes fixed on their joined hands.

“He left us with nothing. My mother… she did her best, but I think a part of her broke after he was gone. She wasn’t strong enough to fight for us the way he would have.”

Her voice wavered—not with grief, but with the fragile edges of old memory.

“I had a brother. Raf.” She gave a soft, humorless smile. “He was good at getting into trouble. I was good at getting him out of it. It… started there.”

She looked up, met Agatha’s eyes.

“I put on a coat, tied my hair back, and told a man three times my size that I was the one he owed money to.”

Agatha gave a quiet, almost amused hum. “And you pulled it off.”

Rio huffed a soft laugh. “I didn’t realize until later… that I liked how it felt.”

She swallowed hard, her voice dropping.

“Liked being seen. Heard. Respected. I kept waiting for it to fall apart. For someone to drag me into the street and strip the lie off me.”

Her throat tightened. “But they never did.”

She hesitated—then looked down again.

“And now… I don’t know if I’m still pretending or if this is just who I became.”

Agatha’s hand squeezed hers gently.

“You became exactly who you were meant to be,” Agatha said softly.

Rio’s eyes stung before she could stop it.

She let out a shaky breath. “I’ve never said that aloud before.”

Agatha smiled, a little sad, a little proud. “Then I’m honored to be the first to hear it.”

She shifted, turning slightly toward Rio, her hand slipping gently to her cheek.

“My mother,” Agatha said softly, “was a monster.”

Rio blinked, startled.

Agatha’s voice remained calm—softer now, threaded with something sharp but steady.

“She married a title. Bore a child she didn’t want. Shaped me into something sharp and cold because she believed that’s what the world demanded. And when I didn’t fit into her plans… she tried to break me.”

Her fingers brushed lightly along Rio’s jaw.

“So I left. I turned my back on every title, every expectation… and I became my own.”

She gave a soft, bitter smile. “And like you… I kept waiting for someone to strip it away.”

Rio swallowed hard, her heart aching.

“But they never did?” she whispered.

Agatha’s eyes softened. “No.”

They sat there—two women who’d built themselves out of ruin and refusal—
Their truths settling between them like the softest, strongest bond either of them had ever known.

Rio gave a slow, trembling smile.

“So… what do we do now?”

Agatha smiled back—warm, certain.

“Whatever we want.”
=======
The afternoon crowd along the Thames was lively but polite, a mix of families, promenading couples, and London’s curious assortment of dignified idlers.

Wanda strolled at Vision’s side, her gloved hand resting lightly on his arm as they walked together along the broad promenade.

A step behind them—close enough to be seen, far enough to be whispered about—Agatha and Rio matched their pace.

Rio wore her usual dark coat, her gloved hand neatly holding the top of her cane.
But today, her shoulders sat differently.

She wasn’t hiding.

Agatha walked beside her with the same calm, measured grace she always carried—except today, her hand rested gently over Rio’s arm, her fingers curling lightly at the crook of her elbow.

To a casual observer, they looked the perfect picture of a fashionable couple.

To those who watched closely…
There was something more.

And it wasn’t long before someone noticed.

A pair of elderly ladies passed them at a leisurely pace, their lace parasols bobbing as they exchanged low, approving murmurs.

One of them cast a glance at Agatha and Rio—and smiled.

“What a handsome couple,” the woman said softly to her companion, just loud enough to carry.

Her companion hummed in agreement. “A most striking pair.”

Rio felt a flush creep up the back of her neck.

But before she could shift or glance away—

Agatha leaned in, her voice soft but edged with unmistakable amusement.

“Well,” she murmured near Rio’s ear, “we did intend to be seen.”

Rio turned, catching Agatha’s eye—
And for once, didn’t look away.

She gave a soft, private smile. “Let them look.”

Ahead of them, Wanda half-turned, catching their exchange with a glance over her shoulder.

Her smile was small… but proud.

And Vision, ever serene, offered a quiet nod of approval that might have meant everything—or nothing.

But to Rio and Agatha, walking in step with the world watching—

It meant freedom.
=======
The invitation came unexpectedly.

A quiet word at the end of a shared afternoon—no grand gestures, no careful maneuvering.

Rio had simply caught Agatha’s hand as they stepped away from the Maximoffs’ gate, her grip light but certain.

“Walk with me,” she said softly.

Agatha had arched a brow, lips curving. “Taking liberties, Professor?”

Rio’s answering smile was soft… but sure. “I’d like you to see my place.”

There was something in her voice—
Not shy.
Not hesitant.

Something steadier.
Intentional.

Agatha felt her heart give a quiet, unexpected flutter.

She inclined her head, her lips quirking. “Lead the way.”

Rio’s flat was modest—a few rooms above a bookshop in a quieter part of the city.

Clean, neat, not lavish.
But entirely her own.

And Agatha realized, as she stepped inside, that this was the first space she’d entered that belonged wholly to Rio—not to the role she played, not to the mask she wore.

To her.

Rio slipped her coat from her shoulders, draping it carefully over the back of a chair.

Agatha watched as she moved easily around the room—lighting a lamp, setting out two cups from a small cabinet—

Not fidgeting.
Not performing.

At ease.

And something in Agatha’s chest tightened in the best way.

She settled on the edge of a worn but comfortable settee, watching as Rio poured tea with calm, practiced hands.

When Rio finally turned back, she met Agatha’s eyes directly.

And for the first time…

Agatha felt the subtle, unmistakable shift of being seen—
Not by someone trying to decode her,
But by someone choosing her.

Rio crossed the room, setting the tea aside untouched—

And instead of taking the seat beside her, she knelt gently on the floor at Agatha’s feet.

Agatha’s breath caught.

Rio looked up, her hands resting lightly on Agatha’s knees.

“May I?” she asked softly.

Not seeking permission out of fear.
But out of quiet respect.

Agatha felt her lips curve—soft, surprised, warmed from the inside out.

She reached down, threading her fingers gently into Rio’s hair.

“Please.”

And for the first time, it wasn’t Agatha leading—

It was Rio.

And Agatha… let her.
=======
Rio’s hands slid gently over Agatha’s knees, her touch light—deliberate.

She didn’t rush.
Didn’t pull.

She simply held her there, steady, looking up with a softness that made Agatha’s throat tighten.

“You’ve been carrying both of us,” Rio said quietly. “Out there.”

Agatha blinked, her fingers brushing idly through Rio’s dark hair. “And?”

Rio’s lips curved faintly. “I’d like the chance to carry you, too.”

The words hit deeper than Agatha expected—
Low, sharp, soft in the places she didn’t often admit she still ached.

She let her hand drift down, her fingers tracing lightly along Rio’s jaw.

“You have a talent for saying precisely what I need to hear,” Agatha murmured.

Rio caught her hand gently, pressing a kiss against her palm.

“Not a talent,” she said softly. “Just… truth.”

She rose slightly on her knees, leaning forward until their faces were inches apart—

And kissed Agatha with a quiet, controlled reverence.

It wasn’t heated.
It wasn’t claiming.

It was a giving.

A soft, steady reminder that Rio wasn’t afraid to take the lead—
Not with force.
Not with dominance.

With care.
With choice.

Agatha let her eyes drift shut, her free hand sliding gently against Rio’s shoulder, feeling the steady thrum of her pulse beneath the fabric of her shirt.

When they parted, Rio rested her forehead lightly against Agatha’s.

“I want this,” Rio whispered. “Not just behind closed doors… but always.”

Agatha exhaled a soft, breathless laugh. “You’re dangerously close to courting me properly, Rosario.”

Rio’s answering smile was soft—and entirely unrepentant.

“Good,” she whispered. “That was the plan.”
=======
Rio’s hands slid gently from Agatha’s knees, gliding up along the fabric of her skirts until they rested lightly at her hips—
A careful touch, deliberate and steady.

Agatha didn’t stop her.

Didn’t pull away.

Instead, she tilted her head slightly, letting her fingers trail from Rio’s shoulder down along her collar—feeling the quiet strength in the body that knelt so willingly before her.

Rio’s breath hitched softly—
And Agatha felt the answering hum low in her own chest.

The space between them tightened, the air charged with something warmer, heavier.

Not rushed.
Not frantic.

But inevitable.

Rio leaned in again, pressing a slower, deeper kiss to Agatha’s lips—
Her hands curling slightly at Agatha’s waist as if anchoring them both.

Agatha responded in kind—letting her hand slide into Rio’s dark hair, threading through soft strands as she kissed her back, matching the depth… but not taking over.

When they broke apart this time, Rio didn’t move far—
Her lips brushed lightly against the line of Agatha’s jaw, her voice a soft, reverent murmur.

“I want to know all of you.”

Agatha’s breath caught.

Her heart thudded, sharp and soft at once.

She let her eyes fall half-closed, tilting her head just enough to let Rio’s lips graze the skin just below her ear.

“And you will,” she whispered.

She pressed her hand gently against Rio’s chest—feeling the steady, wild rhythm beneath her palm—
And smiled.

“But not tonight.”

Rio froze—
Then exhaled a soft, low laugh against her skin.

Agatha leaned back, catching her eyes.

Her voice dropped—low, teasing, but edged with something real.

“Consider this… your turn to wait.”

Rio met her gaze, dark eyes shining with something softer than want—
Something dangerously close to adoration.

“As long as you let me stay beside you while I do,” Rio murmured.

Agatha’s lips curved—soft, slow, certain.

“Always.”
=======
The Maximoff parlor was quiet that evening—Vision had taken the boys to a lecture, and Wanda sat by the hearth, embroidering with the kind of absent ease that suggested she’d rather be doing anything else.

Agatha stood by the window, arms loosely folded, staring out into the soft London dusk.

Not sharp.
Not guarded.

Just… soft.

Wanda glanced up, watching her for a long moment before setting her embroidery aside.

“You’re different lately,” Wanda said lightly.

Agatha arched a brow without turning. “How observant of you.”

Wanda smiled faintly. “I am known for it.”

A quiet passed between them—comfortable, but heavy with the unspoken.

Finally, Wanda said softly, “It suits you.”

Agatha let out a low hum, her eyes still on the fading light beyond the glass.

“Does it?”

Wanda rose, crossing the room until she stood just beside her.

“You care for her.”

Not a question.

Agatha exhaled slowly. “Yes.”

She didn’t try to deny it—what would be the point?

Wanda tilted her head slightly, studying her friend’s profile. “And?”

Agatha’s hands tightened slightly around her arms.

“And I’m terrified,” she admitted, her voice soft but clear.

Wanda gave a small, knowing nod. “Of?”

Agatha swallowed. “Of losing her. Of ruining this before it’s even begun.”

Her jaw tightened.

“Of wanting something I might never be able to have… out in the open. Of what it means to want her at all.”

Wanda’s expression softened.

She reached out, laying a hand gently on Agatha’s arm.

“You’ve never been afraid of wanting before.”

Agatha’s lips quirked—half a smile, half a grimace. “I’ve never had something I was afraid of losing before.”

Wanda gave her arm a soft squeeze. “That’s not weakness, Agatha.”

Agatha met her eyes for the first time.

Wanda smiled gently. “That’s love.”

Agatha held her gaze for a long, steady moment.

And then—finally—she let out a soft, almost breathless laugh.

“God help me,” she murmured, “I think it is.”

Wanda leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to her cheek.

“Good,” she whispered. “It’s about time.”
=======
Rio found Wanda in the Maximoff garden one afternoon, pruning the last of the summer roses with the kind of precision that could cut deeper than any shears.

For a moment, Rio watched her in silence—hands steady, posture composed, as though Wanda could make anything in her orbit bend neatly to her will.

Finally, Rio cleared her throat gently.

“Mrs. Maximoff?”

Wanda glanced over her shoulder, arching a brow. “Professor Vidal.”

Her lips quirked faintly at the title—like a private joke she wasn’t sharing.

Rio stepped closer, hands clasped lightly behind her back.

“I… wondered if I might have a word with you.”

Wanda set her shears aside, wiping her gloved hands delicately on a cloth.

“Of course.” She gestured toward a bench beneath the arbor. “Shall we?”

Rio followed, sitting only after Wanda did—heart thudding with a strange, unsteady mix of nerves and determination.

Wanda folded her hands in her lap, her expression serene but attentive.

Rio drew a slow breath.

“I… care for Agatha.”

Wanda tilted her head slightly. “I know.”

That startled a quiet huff of breath from Rio. “I’d… like to court her properly. With your blessing, if I may.”

Wanda’s lips curved in that maddening, knowing way she’d perfected over the years.

“You’ve been courting her for weeks, Professor.”

Rio flushed, dropping her gaze for a moment.

“I’d still like to do this… right.”

Wanda studied her for a long, quiet moment.

Then—softly—“Why?”

Rio looked up, surprised. “Why?”

Wanda nodded. “Why ask for my blessing? You don’t need it.”

Rio’s throat tightened. “Because… she deserves to have someone stand by her side who respects the people she loves. And because I…”

She swallowed, her voice dropping.

“Because I want her to know I see her. All of her. And I’m not afraid to ask for her hand the way a man would… even if I’m not one.”

Wanda’s eyes softened, the faintest warmth flickering there.

She reached out, resting a hand gently over Rio’s.

“Then you have it,” she said quietly. “Not because you asked… but because you meant it.”

Rio let out a slow, unsteady breath—one that felt strangely like relief.

Wanda gave her hand a soft squeeze.

“And I won’t stand in your way… as long as you remember that she’s not a woman who needs anyone’s protection.”

Rio smiled—quiet, honest. “I know.”

Wanda leaned back, her smile softening into something fond.

“Good.” She picked up her shears again. “Now go make her fall in love with you properly… though I imagine you’re already halfway there.”

Rio stood, her heart lighter than it had been in weeks.

And as she left the garden, she could’ve sworn she heard Wanda murmur—

“About time someone saw her for who she is.”
=======
Agatha was waiting in the Maximoff library when Rio found her, curled elegantly on the settee with a book in hand and a soft, private smile on her lips.

She didn’t look up when Rio stepped inside.

“You do realize,” Agatha said lightly, “that asking Wanda for her blessing only encourages her meddling tendencies.”

Rio leaned against the doorframe, crossing her arms with a soft huff. “You know?”

Agatha finally lifted her gaze, eyes sparkling. “She made a point of telling me.”

Rio gave a quiet, almost bashful smile. “I thought it was… appropriate.”

Agatha closed the book, setting it aside on the cushion beside her.

“Oh, how noble of you, Professor,” she teased, her lips curving. “Courting me properly, like a true gentleman.”

Rio chuckled, stepping closer. “Would you rather I hadn’t?”

Agatha tilted her head, considering. “I rather enjoy watching you play at being a gentleman.”

Rio stopped just before the settee, her brow arching slightly. “Play at?”

Agatha gave her a look full of mock innocence—and something sharper beneath. “Well… you certainly look the part.”

Rio smirked, leaning forward, bracing her hands on either side of Agatha’s chair.

“And do I play it well?”

Agatha’s eyes darkened slightly—not with mockery, but with the heat of something neither of them quite dared to name yet.

“Well enough,” she murmured. “Though I suspect you’re far better at taking what you want when you stop pretending to be something you’re not.”

Rio’s breath caught—
And Agatha smiled, soft and slow, as she reached up and gently, deliberately, loosened the knot of Rio’s cravat.

The brush of her fingers against Rio’s throat sent a sharp ripple of heat straight to her core.

“I like you like this,” Agatha whispered. “Just you.”

Rio met her gaze, the air tightening between them.

Their faces inches apart.

Her hands flexed against the cushion behind Agatha’s shoulders—fighting every instinct that screamed at her to take, to kiss, to claim—

And then—

Agatha leaned in, her lips brushing lightly against Rio’s jaw.

“Tell me to stop,” Agatha murmured against her skin.

Rio shivered—
And didn’t say a word.

She felt Agatha’s smile against her jawline.

But then—Agatha pulled back just slightly, her fingers still resting at Rio’s collar.

“We’ll save that for when we’re not in someone else’s library,” Agatha whispered, her voice low and warm.

Rio let out a soft, shaky laugh, straightening only a little—her heart hammering, her skin alight.

“Tease,” she murmured.

Agatha smirked, smoothing down Rio’s cravat with a slow, deliberate hand.

“Always.”
=======
Rio had barely caught her breath when Agatha reached for her again—this time with an almost casual grace that belied the sharp intent in her touch.

Fingers traced lightly along the edge of Rio’s collar, smoothing the fabric down—
Lingering.
Just a second too long.

“Such a shame,” Agatha murmured, her voice velvet-smooth.

Rio arched a brow, her mouth dry. “What is?”

Agatha tilted her head, her smile soft and far too knowing.

“That we’ve only just begun this little game of ours…”

She leaned in, close enough that Rio could feel her breath against her skin—

“And already I want to see how far I can make you fall apart.”

Rio’s heart slammed against her ribs.

Agatha drew back—just enough to meet her eyes—and Rio caught a flicker of something dangerous and deliciously pleased there.

She swallowed, her voice a little rough. “Is this your idea of courting?”

Agatha’s smile deepened. “Courting, yes… but I don’t recall promising to play fair.”

Rio huffed a soft, breathless laugh—and didn’t miss how Agatha’s gaze dropped briefly to her lips.

But then—

Agatha stepped back with the slow, deliberate grace of a woman very much in control of herself… and the situation.

She brushed a hand gently down Rio’s arm as she moved past her toward the door.

“When you’re ready,” Agatha said softly, glancing back with a teasing glint in her eyes, “you know where to find me.”

And just like that—
She was gone.

Leaving Rio standing in the quiet library, her skin burning, her heart thundering…

And her resolve hanging by a thread.
=======
It was late afternoon when Agatha found Wanda in the drawing room, seated by the window with a novel in her lap and a faint smile playing at her lips.

The soft London light caught at Wanda’s hair, casting a quiet halo about her, and for a brief, absurd moment, Agatha wondered if anyone else would ever believe this woman had once talked a man like Vision into marriage.

She lingered in the doorway, debating—
But Wanda, without looking up, said lightly, “If you have something to ask me, you may as well come in.”

Agatha smirked despite herself and stepped inside.

Wanda set her book aside, folding her hands neatly in her lap. “Trouble with our professor?”

Agatha let out a soft, dry laugh and sank into the chair opposite her.

“I don’t know if I’m pushing her too far,” she admitted quietly. “If I’m being reckless with something I don’t fully understand yet.”

Wanda gave her a long, thoughtful look—
And then tilted her head, her eyes softening.

“You’ve never been cruel, Agatha.”

Agatha’s smile was faint—thin and sharp around the edges. “No. But I’m very good at getting what I want.”

Wanda’s lips twitched. “So am I.”

Agatha arched a brow. “I seem to recall your courtship with Vision was… painfully proper.”

Wanda let out a soft, almost scandalous little laugh.

“Oh, darling,” she said with a quiet, amused glint in her eyes, “we didn’t marry because I was proper.”

Agatha blinked, momentarily caught off guard.

Wanda gave a perfectly innocent smile. “We married because I was very, very good at making him forget he was supposed to wait until after.”

Agatha stared at her—half in shock, half in delighted horror.

“You didn’t.”

Wanda gave a delicate shrug. “You’d be surprised what a man can overlook when a woman knows what she wants.”

Agatha let out a soft, breathless laugh. “You’re a menace.”

Wanda smiled sweetly. “Only to the ones I care about.”

A long moment passed—
Then Wanda reached over, covering Agatha’s hand with hers.

“Don’t be afraid of wanting her,” Wanda said softly. “And don’t be afraid of letting her want you.”

Agatha held her gaze, heart softening.

And for the first time in days, she let herself believe…
That maybe wanting Rio wasn’t a danger at all.
=======
Rio hadn’t planned to send a note.

She hadn’t planned it at all.

But as the evening settled over London, cool and soft as velvet, she found herself scribbling a brief, careful invitation—

If you’re free this evening… I’d like the chance to return the favor. My flat. Just us.

She signed it with a simple —R.

And less than an hour later, Agatha arrived.

Calm. Composed. Dressed in a deep, near-black violet coat that set Rio’s heart skittering before they’d even exchanged a word.

“An invitation to your private quarters,” Agatha murmured as she stepped inside, her eyes glinting with quiet amusement. “Are we scandalizing each other now?”

Rio smirked, reaching for Agatha’s coat with a soft, deliberate touch. “I thought I’d take my turn leading.”

Agatha’s lips curved. “By all means.”

For the first time, Rio felt the shift in the air—
Her flat.
Her space.

And her choice.

She led Agatha inside, poured them each a glass of brandy, and settled on the settee with an ease she hadn’t known she possessed.

Agatha watched her over the rim of her glass—waiting.

When Rio finally set her glass aside and reached for Agatha’s hand, threading their fingers together—

Agatha gave her a soft, approving hum.

“You wear confidence well,” Agatha murmured.

Rio’s pulse jumped. “I’m learning.”

Agatha’s smile deepened, slow and sharp.

“Then allow me to teach you something else.”

Before Rio could answer, Agatha leaned in—

And kissed her.

Not with the soft, careful reverence of before—

But with a slow, deliberate hunger that stole the breath from Rio’s lungs.

Her hand curled gently at Rio’s waist, fingers pressing firm, guiding—
Pulling her closer with a possessive grace that made Rio’s head spin.

Rio responded, matching her kiss with equal depth—

But Agatha’s control didn’t slip.

When Rio tried to deepen the kiss, Agatha pulled back just slightly, her lips brushing against Rio’s with maddening restraint.

“You invited me here,” Agatha whispered, her voice low, dark, delicious. “But you forgot something.”

Rio’s breath came shallow, her heart racing. “What’s that?”

Agatha leaned in, her lips grazing Rio’s ear.

“I always decide when I’m finished with you.”

The words sent a sharp, aching bolt of heat straight to Rio’s core.

She shivered—
And Agatha felt it.

Her hand slid from Rio’s waist to her jaw, tilting her face up.

And when she kissed her again—

It was softer…

But no less devastating.

By the time they broke apart, Rio’s chest was rising and falling in slow, uneven breaths.

Agatha brushed her thumb lightly across Rio’s bottom lip, her eyes dark with something dangerous and entirely hers.

“Your turn to unravel now,” Agatha murmured.

And Rio—

For once—

Let herself fall.
=======
Agatha brushed her thumb lightly across Rio’s bottom lip, her eyes dark with something dangerous and entirely hers.

“And I am nowhere near done with you,” Agatha murmured—

And then, with a slow, deliberate grace, hitched her skirts just enough to swing one knee over Rio’s lap.

She settled against her—confident, effortless—like she’d always belonged there.

Rio sucked in a sharp breath, her hands instinctively finding Agatha’s waist as the weight of her settled warm and real in her lap.

Agatha’s smirk deepened as she leaned in, their faces mere inches apart.

“Is this how you imagined it, Rosario?” she whispered, her lips ghosting over Rio’s. “When you decided to take the lead tonight?”

Rio’s hands tightened slightly at her waist, her heart thudding so hard she could feel it in her throat.

“I… I didn’t exactly think this far ahead,” Rio admitted, her voice low and rough.

Agatha hummed—soft, dangerous.

“Good.”

And then she kissed her—

Slow at first, lips parting in a soft, deliberate press…
Then deeper, hotter, as Agatha shifted in Rio’s lap, rolling her hips just enough to make Rio’s breath catch in a sharp, shaky gasp.

Rio groaned, her hands sliding instinctively down to Agatha’s hips—

But Agatha caught them, lacing their fingers together, pinning Rio’s hands lightly against her own thighs.

“You’ll touch,” Agatha murmured against her lips, “when I say.”

The words sent a jolt of heat straight through Rio’s veins—sharp, undeniable.

She let out a soft, broken laugh, resting her forehead briefly against Agatha’s. “You are going to ruin me.”

Agatha smiled, wicked and soft all at once.

“That’s the plan.”

She leaned in again—

And this time, when their mouths met, Rio stopped trying to hold on.

She simply let herself fall…

And let Agatha catch her.
=======
Agatha pressed her mouth to Rio’s again—
Slow, deep, calculated.

Her hands guided Rio’s, keeping them pinned lightly against her thighs as she rocked gently in her lap—just enough to make Rio’s pulse thunder in her ears.

“You do look rather pretty when you’re undone,” Agatha murmured against her lips.

Rio let out a soft, ragged breath, her eyes fluttering shut.

“Agatha…”

Agatha smiled against her mouth. “Hm?”

Rio’s hands tensed beneath hers, muscles flexing under the soft leather of Agatha’s gloves.

But Agatha didn’t ease up—she pressed closer, shifting her weight, her lips trailing a slow, maddening path along Rio’s jaw to her neck.

“You’re trembling,” she whispered.

Rio exhaled a shuddering laugh. “Because you’re… impossible.”

Agatha chuckled low, letting her teeth graze the edge of Rio’s throat.

“I’ve been called worse.”

She pressed a slow, open-mouthed kiss to Rio’s neck, savoring the soft sound that escaped her lips—

And that’s when it happened.

The shift.

Rio’s hands—still beneath Agatha’s—suddenly moved, quick and sure.

She caught Agatha by the waist and twisted—

In one swift, fluid motion, Rio lifted Agatha, turning her until Agatha landed with a soft, startled gasp flat on her back against the settee cushions.

Rio followed—leaning over her, her hands braced firmly at either side of Agatha’s head.

Their eyes locked—Agatha’s wide with surprise, her lips parting slightly as Rio hovered above her, breath hard and shallow.

Rio let out a low, dangerous laugh.

“My turn.”

Agatha blinked—then smirked, breathless.

“Finally,” she whispered.

And then—

Rio kissed her.

Not soft.
Not careful.

Hungry. Deep.

Her hands slid to Agatha’s waist, gripping just tight enough to make Agatha arch beneath her with a sharp gasp—

And Rio didn’t stop.

She kissed her like a woman starved—like every ounce of restraint Agatha had been testing had snapped all at once.

When Rio finally broke the kiss, she hovered over Agatha, their foreheads nearly touching, both of them breathing hard.

Agatha let out a soft, breathless laugh, her eyes dark with heat.

“Well,” she murmured, voice husky, “perhaps I’ve been underestimating you.”

Rio smirked, her thumb brushing slowly along Agatha’s waist.

“Don’t make a habit of it.”
=======
“Don’t make a habit of it,” Rio murmured—

And before Agatha could fire back with some wicked remark, Rio’s hands slid down—

Firm, steady—gliding from Agatha’s waist to her hips… then down, over the curves of her thighs.

Agatha sucked in a soft breath, her body instinctively arching beneath her.

But Rio didn’t rush.

Her hands smoothed over the fabric of Agatha’s skirts, fingers pressing just firmly enough to make her aware of every slow pass.

When Rio’s palms traced up along the outside of her legs—sliding higher, higher—Agatha shivered.

Her lips parted, a soft sound slipping free before she could stop it.

Rio leaned down, her mouth brushing the edge of Agatha’s jaw.

“I could keep you like this all night,” Rio whispered, her voice low and rough. “Letting you wonder if I’ll ever touch you the way you want.”

Agatha’s breath hitched sharply.

“Cocky little thing,” she murmured, though her voice lacked its usual bite.

Rio smirked against her skin. “Maybe.”

Her hands slid higher—fingers pressing beneath the hem of Agatha’s skirt now, gliding up along silk-stockinged thighs… slow, maddening, purposeful.

Agatha exhaled, her eyes fluttering shut as Rio’s thumbs traced soft circles just above her knees.

Not nearly enough.

“You’ll have to ask me,” Rio whispered against her ear, her lips grazing the shell of it.

Agatha let out a soft, breathless laugh. “And what—” she managed, her voice a little strained, “—makes you think I’ll beg?”

Rio chuckled low in her throat, her hands sweeping slightly higher, fingers brushing the sensitive skin just above Agatha’s garters.

“Because you want this,” Rio murmured. “And you want me.”

She pressed a slow, teasing kiss beneath Agatha’s ear, her hands pausing just short of where Agatha ached for them.

“Say it,” Rio whispered. “Say you want me.”

Agatha let out a shaky breath—

And for the first time, she felt her control slip, her heart pounding against her ribs in wild, reckless rhythm.

Her hands slid up to Rio’s shoulders, clutching lightly—

And she whispered, soft but fierce—

“I want you.”

Rio smiled against her skin.

“Good.”
=======
Rio’s hands slid higher, fingers slipping beneath the edge of Agatha’s garters—

Close.
So close.

The silk of Agatha’s stockings gave way to soft, bare skin, and Rio took her time exploring every inch—
Brushing, circling, pressing gently into the tender curve of her inner thigh.

Agatha bit back a soft, shaky gasp, her hands tightening slightly at Rio’s shoulders.

“Still sure you’re in control?” Agatha whispered, though the strain in her voice betrayed her.

Rio lifted her head, their eyes locking.

“I’ve never been more certain,” Rio murmured.

She leaned in, catching Agatha’s lower lip gently between her teeth before releasing it with a soft kiss—
All heat and no relief.

Agatha exhaled a slow, shaky breath.

And then—

Her hands moved.

With deliberate, practiced ease, she slipped her fingers beneath the edge of Rio’s waistcoat—finding the buttons and undoing them, one by one, her touch maddeningly slow.

Rio sucked in a sharp breath.

Agatha smirked faintly, her fingers trailing lower as she worked her way down.

“I’ve wondered,” Agatha murmured, “what you’d look like stripped of all that borrowed armor.”

Her hands slipped beneath Rio’s open waistcoat now, fingers deftly finding the buttons of her shirt.

Rio’s breath hitched as Agatha parted the fabric, baring the soft curve of her collarbone—

And kissed her there.

A slow, lingering press of lips against skin that made Rio shudder.

Agatha’s voice dropped, low and thick.

“You’re beautiful.”

Rio’s heart slammed against her ribs—

And her hands slipped higher, fingers brushing the very edge of Agatha’s undergarments now, teasing at the skin just beneath.

Agatha let out a soft, involuntary gasp—
Her hands tightening in Rio’s half-open shirt.

And suddenly, they were both trembling—
Caught between the want that burned through every inch of them and the reckless need to make this moment last.

Neither giving in.
Neither pulling away.

Just… falling.

Together.
=======
Agatha's breath came shallow, her lips still parted from the kiss pressed against Rio’s collarbone.

For a heartbeat, neither of them moved—
Balanced on the edge, trembling, the world narrowing down to the press of hands, the burn of skin, the weight of everything they hadn’t said.

And then—

Agatha leaned up, her mouth grazing Rio’s ear as she whispered, low and sure—

“Rio… take me to bed.”

The words shot through Rio like a jolt—sharp, hot, electrifying.

She pulled back just enough to look at Agatha—
To see the flush in her cheeks, the dark heat in her eyes, the faint, wicked curve of her lips.

And without a word—

Rio stood, lifting Agatha effortlessly into her arms.

Agatha let out a soft, surprised laugh, her hands curling into Rio’s now half-open shirt.

Rio smirked, her voice low. “As you wish.”

She carried her through the quiet flat, their hearts beating fast and uneven, their breaths coming soft and shallow—

And when they reached the bedroom, Rio set her down with the same steady care she’d given every risk she’d ever taken.

Except this time—
It wasn’t a risk.

It was them.

Agatha reached for her first—fingers finding the buttons of Rio’s waistcoat again, this time slipping it fully off her shoulders.

Rio’s hands moved in turn, gliding down to the laces at the back of Agatha’s gown, undoing them slowly, reverently, peeling back every layer between them.

Not rushed.
Not frantic.

But with a slow, burning purpose.

Layer by layer—

Corset loosened.
Shirt unbuttoned.
Stockings eased down.

Cravat falling to the floor.

Until there was nothing left between them but skin…

And everything they’d never been allowed to want.

They stood there for a long moment—
Agatha in nothing but soft linen and bare skin, Rio stripped of shirt and pretense alike—

Looking.
Taking each other in.

And then—

Rio reached for her, hands settling on Agatha’s waist, her touch firm but trembling just slightly at the edges.

Agatha leaned in, her forehead pressing gently to Rio’s.

“No masks,” she whispered.

Rio’s breath hitched. “No masks.”

And together—

They fell back into the bed, hands and mouths meeting in a tangle of soft sighs and sharp, desperate kisses—

Shedding everything the world expected of them.

Until it was just them.

Just love.

Just this.
=======
They fell into the bed together—
A slow descent of tangled limbs, soft linen sheets, and the warmth of bare skin meeting bare skin for the first time.

Rio pressed her lips softly to Agatha’s throat, tasting the faint salt of her skin as Agatha arched beneath her.

Her hands moved with slow purpose—
Gliding up from Agatha’s waist, mapping the curve of her hips, the delicate line of her ribs, the soft swell of her breasts beneath her chemise.

Agatha’s breath hitched, her hands sliding up to cup Rio’s face—
Guiding her into a kiss that was slow, hungry, a claiming in its own right.

They kissed until breathing became a question neither of them cared to answer.

And when Rio finally pulled back, her hands sliding beneath the hem of Agatha’s chemise—

Agatha lifted her arms wordlessly, letting Rio peel the last barrier away with a slow, reverent touch.

The fabric slipped over her head, falling away, leaving Agatha gloriously bare beneath Rio’s hands.

Rio exhaled a soft, shaky breath.

“God…” she whispered, her voice rough, awed.

Agatha’s lips curved in a slow, wicked smile. “Look your fill, Rosario.”

Rio did.

She took in every inch—every soft curve, every faint mark, every perfect imperfection.

And then—

She leaned down, pressing a slow, open-mouthed kiss to the curve of Agatha’s breast, her tongue flicking softly over the peak before she sucked gently—

Agatha gasped, her back arching beneath her.

Rio smiled against her skin, her hands sliding lower—palming the swell of her hips, fingers brushing teasingly along the inside of her thighs.

“You’re cruel,” Agatha breathed, her voice half-laugh, half-moan.

Rio kissed her way back up, hovering just over her lips.

“Not yet.”

And with that—

Her hand slipped between Agatha’s thighs.

Slow.
Deliberate.

Fingers finding slick, heated skin—
Gliding gently, parting her folds with a soft, teasing touch that made Agatha’s breath catch sharp in her throat.

Agatha shuddered, her hands fisting in the sheets.

“Rio…” she whispered, her voice breaking.

Rio pressed a soft kiss to her mouth, her fingers circling slow and steady against Agatha’s most sensitive spot—light, teasing, maddening.

“I’ve got you,” she whispered.

Agatha let out a low, wrecked sound—half laugh, half plea.

Rio swallowed it with a kiss, her fingers pressing in slowly—one first, then two—stretching her with a slow, aching glide that made Agatha’s body arch beneath her, a soft cry escaping her lips.

Rio moved with care, her thumb circling gently as her fingers curled—

And Agatha…

Agatha broke apart.

Her body shuddered, hips lifting to meet each slow thrust of Rio’s hand, her head falling back against the pillow, gasps tumbling from her lips in soft, breathless cries.

Rio kissed her through it—whispering soft words against her skin, hands steady, never rushing—

Until Agatha came apart beneath her with a soft, broken moan, her body trembling in Rio’s arms.

They stayed like that—

Breathing.
Holding.

Neither willing to let the moment end.
=======
Agatha lay beneath Rio for a heartbeat longer, letting the aftershocks of her release ripple through her—

But even as her breath steadied, her eyes opened with that slow, dangerous gleam Rio had come to recognize far too well.

Before Rio could shift, could even think to move away—

Agatha’s hands slid firmly up her arms, flipping them with a sharp, fluid twist of her hips until Rio found herself flat on her back, a startled gasp escaping her lips.

Agatha hovered over her—her hair falling loose around her face, eyes dark with heat and something far more dangerous.

Rio blinked up at her, heart racing. “Agatha—”

Agatha leaned down, her lips brushing the shell of Rio’s ear.

“My turn.”

She kissed her—deep, hungry, no hesitation—
And Rio melted beneath her, arms sliding up to clutch at Agatha’s back, fingers tangling in soft hair.

Agatha took her time kissing her way down—

Mouth lingering at Rio’s throat…
Trailing hot, open-mouthed kisses along the line of her collarbone…
Pressing slow, reverent worship to the soft swell of her chest.

She peeled open Rio’s shirt fully, baring the soft planes of her body—

And when her mouth closed over a hardened peak, sucking slow and deliberate—

Rio gasped, her hips lifting instinctively, her hands clutching at the sheets.

“Agatha—” she breathed, her voice sharp, wrecked.

But Agatha only smiled against her skin, dragging her mouth lower—

Over the smooth curve of Rio’s belly…
Down, down…

Until she settled between Rio’s thighs, hands curling over her hips with a slow, possessive certainty.

Rio’s breath hitched, her entire body tensing—

And then—

Agatha kissed her.

Hot, soft, devastating.

Her tongue flicked slow and deliberate—
Her lips moving in a maddening rhythm that stole the air from Rio’s lungs.

Rio moaned—
A raw, broken sound that filled the quiet room—
Her hands flying to Agatha’s shoulders, clutching tight.

Agatha didn’t stop.

She held her there—
Held her down with the weight of her mouth, her hands, her unshakable control—

And worshipped her.

Slow.
Thorough.
Unrelenting.

Until Rio shattered—

Her back arching, her breath catching in a sharp, gasping cry as release tore through her in a wave so fierce it left her trembling beneath Agatha’s hands.

When it was over, when Rio collapsed back against the sheets, breathless and undone—

Agatha kissed her way back up, slow and soft, pressing a final, lingering kiss to her lips.

“You taste like everything I’ve been waiting for,” Agatha whispered against her mouth.

Rio laughed—breathless, wrecked—curling her arms around Agatha and holding her close.

“God help me,” she whispered, “I’m already yours.”
=======
They lay tangled in the sheets—
Skin pressed to skin, hearts still racing in the quiet lull after.

Agatha rested half atop Rio, her head tucked against her shoulder, one arm draped lazily across her waist.

Rio’s fingers traced soft, aimless patterns along the smooth curve of Agatha’s back, her breath finally steadying into slow, even rhythm.

For a long while, neither spoke.

There was no need.

It was enough to be here—
Together.
Unmasked.
Undone.

But then—

Agatha stirred slightly, lifting her head just enough to meet Rio’s eyes.

Her expression softened into something raw, open… the wicked confidence still there but softened at the edges by something far more dangerous.

Something real.

“I meant it,” Agatha murmured. “When I said you’re mine.”

Rio’s heart thudded—low, sharp.

She swallowed, her throat thick.

“And I’m yours,” Rio whispered back.

Agatha leaned in, their lips brushing in a kiss so soft it felt more like a promise than a demand.

And for once—

Neither of them tried to take control.

They just… stayed.

Held each other in the quiet aftermath of everything they’d let fall away.

The morning came soft and slow, golden light spilling in through the half-drawn curtains.

Rio woke first—

Agatha still curled against her side, her hand resting lightly over Rio’s heart, her breathing slow and even.

For a moment, Rio simply stared—

At the softness of Agatha’s features in sleep.
At the delicate curve of her lips.
At the faint, nearly invisible line between her brows that softened only in moments like this.

And in that quiet, breathless moment—

Rio knew.

Knew that this…

This was everything.

Agatha stirred slowly, eyes fluttering open, a soft, sleepy smile tugging at her lips when she saw Rio watching her.

“Mmm… staring already?” Agatha murmured, her voice rough with sleep.

Rio smiled, her fingers brushing a lock of dark hair from Agatha’s face.

“Couldn’t help myself.”

Agatha gave a soft hum, curling closer.

“You’ll make a menace of yourself yet,” she teased.

Rio chuckled low in her throat. “If you’re lucky.”

Agatha laughed softly—then pressed a gentle kiss to Rio’s bare shoulder.

They lay there in the soft hush of morning—

And for the first time in either of their lives…

They didn’t feel like they had to be anyone but exactly who they were.
=======
A week passed—

And somehow, without either of them speaking it aloud, Agatha and Rio fell into a rhythm that felt as inevitable as breathing.

They still walked side by side through London’s streets—
Still maintained the practiced dance of propriety in public—
But now…

Now their hands would brush, linger.
Now Agatha’s eyes would soften when Rio looked at her.
Now Rio would glance over her shoulder just a little too often, making sure Agatha was always within reach.

And Wanda noticed.

Of course she did.

She said nothing at first—

But the first time she caught them standing just a little too close in the Maximoff garden, speaking in soft tones with that unmistakable look between them…

She smiled.

A soft, secret, delighted thing.

She passed by with a casual glance, her eyes dancing with quiet mischief.

“Lovely day for a courtship,” Wanda said lightly, not even breaking stride.

Agatha arched a brow, her lips curving. “You’re incorrigible.”

Wanda smiled sweetly. “It’s in the marriage vows.”

Vision, standing nearby with a book under his arm, lifted a brow in faint amusement. “I don’t recall that clause.”

Wanda leaned in to kiss his cheek, her eyes never leaving Agatha’s.

“You didn’t read the fine print.”

Agatha huffed a soft laugh.

And Rio, standing beside her, caught the faintest blush rise on Agatha’s cheeks—

And swore she fell in love all over again.
=======
It happened one afternoon in the Maximoff garden—again.

Rio had been helping Vision carry in a new shipment of books (and quietly making sure Agatha didn’t hurt herself lifting something far too heavy with stubborn pride), when Wanda appeared beside her with a soft, measured smile.

“Would you walk with me?” Wanda asked lightly, as though she hadn’t been watching Rio like a cat watches a mouse for the past several minutes.

Rio glanced toward Agatha, who was deeply engrossed in some quiet debate with Vision over the cataloging system.

“I—of course.”

Wanda slipped her hand lightly through Rio’s arm, guiding her toward the quieter edge of the garden path.

They strolled in silence for a few moments, Wanda humming softly, her posture relaxed.

Rio waited.

Finally, Wanda said, casual as anything—

“She loves you.”

Rio blinked. “I—”

Wanda gave her a look—soft, steady, unshakably kind.

“I thought you should know. Not that I imagine you doubted it.”

Rio swallowed. “I… hoped.”

Wanda smiled, slowing her steps.

“She’s never allowed herself anything real before.”

They stopped beneath a flowering arbor, the soft hush of leaves curling around them.

Wanda met Rio’s eyes, her expression open.

“You don’t have to wait for permission,” Wanda said gently. “You have it. From me. From her.”

Rio’s heart twisted—sharp and soft all at once.

Wanda’s hand gave her arm a gentle squeeze.

“She’s just waiting for you to be brave enough to ask.”

Rio let out a soft, breathless laugh. “I’ve never been more terrified in my life.”

Wanda smiled, tilting her head.

“Good. That means it’s real.”

She leaned in, pressing a kiss to Rio’s cheek—a rare, fond gesture.

“And when you do ask…”

She gave her a look full of quiet, gleeful mischief.

“I expect to be the first to know.”
=======
It started with a quiet word in the garden—

Wanda appearing at Rio’s side with a simple, “Come by tomorrow. Mid-morning.”

No explanation.

When Rio arrived at the Maximoff townhouse the next day, Wanda was waiting with gloves in hand and a knowing smile.

“Jeweler,” Wanda said briskly, linking her arm through Rio’s before she could so much as ask. “You’ll want a private one.”

Rio blinked. “You—”

Wanda squeezed her arm. “I’ve arranged it. You don’t think I let Vision pick his own, do you?”

Rio laughed—soft, breathless—and let herself be pulled along.

The ring was perfect.

Simple. Elegant. A narrow band of platinum set with a deep violet stone that caught the light in a way that felt unmistakably… Agatha.

And when Rio turned to thank Wanda, Wanda gave her a soft, proud look.

“Now,” Wanda said, “all you need… is the moment.”

That moment came a week later.

An afternoon walk—nothing unusual.

But when Agatha and Rio reached the quiet curve of the garden path beneath the old ash tree, Rio hesitated.

Agatha arched a brow, her lips curving faintly. “Second thoughts?”

Rio smiled—soft, sure.

“Not even close.”

She reached into her coat pocket…

And withdrew the ring.

Agatha stilled—her eyes widening, her breath catching in a way Rio had never seen before.

Rio held it out—steady, her heart racing.

“You said once you’ve never been good at pretending.”

Agatha let out a soft, stunned laugh. “I did.”

Rio smiled, her voice dropping low.

“Neither am I. Not with you.”

She slipped the ring gently onto Agatha’s finger, her hands warm and sure.

“So… if you’ll have me—”

Agatha’s hand shot up, catching Rio’s face between her palms—

And kissed her.

Soft. Fierce. Completely them.

When they broke apart, Agatha pressed her forehead to Rio’s, her voice barely more than a whisper.

“Yes.”

Rio let out a soft, breathless laugh. “Yes?”

Agatha smiled against her lips.

“God help you, Rosario. Yes.”
=======
They stayed locked together beneath the ash tree—foreheads pressed, breath mingling, hearts pounding.

For a blissful moment, it felt like the world had narrowed to just Agatha and Rio…

Until—

“Ahem.”

They both froze.

Slowly, as one, they turned—

To find Wanda standing a polite distance down the path, her hands clasped neatly before her, an expression of utter serenity on her face.

Too serene.

Far too composed.

Agatha arched a brow, lips curving despite herself. “How long?”

Wanda smiled sweetly. “Long enough.”

Rio groaned softly, hiding her face against Agatha’s shoulder. “Of course.”

Wanda stepped forward, her eyes dancing.

“I thought I might wait until the ‘yes’ was confirmed before offering my congratulations.”

Agatha tilted her head, giving Wanda a sharp, amused look. “And you expect us to believe you weren’t lurking in the shrubbery for this exact moment?”

Wanda gave her most innocent smile. “I was simply enjoying a walk in my own garden. I’m sure I don’t know what you mean.”

Rio let out a soft, helpless laugh, wrapping an arm around Agatha’s waist.

Agatha shook her head, giving Wanda a look that was half exasperation, half fondness.

“Well,” Wanda said lightly, stepping closer, “I suppose I’ll have to begin planning the guest list immediately.”

Agatha blinked. “The what now?”

Wanda’s grin was slow, wicked, and entirely delighted.

“For the wedding, of course.”

And with that—

Wanda kissed Agatha on the cheek, gave Rio a playful pat on the arm…

And swept back down the garden path like the world’s most well-dressed schemer.

Agatha stared after her for a long, quiet moment—

Then looked at Rio, her eyes soft and shining.

“We’re doomed,” she murmured.

Rio smiled, pressing a soft kiss to her temple.

“Happily.”
=======
They barely made it through Rio’s front door before Agatha was in her arms—

Their mouths meeting in a fierce, breathless kiss that left them both laughing softly against each other’s lips.

Rio swept Agatha into her flat, kicking the door closed behind them, her heart light in a way she hadn’t felt since she was a girl.

They undressed each other slowly—
Not with urgency, but with the kind of reverence that came from knowing they’d crossed a threshold neither of them wanted to return from.

When Rio finally laid Agatha back against the soft, familiar sheets of her bed, Agatha reached up, threading her fingers gently through Rio’s hair.

“I’ve never said yes to anything like this before,” Agatha whispered.

Rio leaned down, brushing her lips softly against Agatha’s.

“I’ll spend the rest of my life making sure you never regret it.”

Agatha’s smile softened, her eyes dark with something Rio knew she would never grow tired of seeing—

Love.

Real. Undeniable. Theirs.

They spent the night tangled together—

Hands exploring, mouths meeting in slow, lingering kisses, bodies moving with a soft, sweet urgency that had nothing to do with proving anything—

And everything to do with claiming each other in the only way that mattered.
=======
The morning sun filtered softly through the curtains of Rio’s flat, casting a golden light over the quiet mess of tangled sheets and discarded clothing.

Agatha lay stretched out beside Rio, her head resting on Rio’s bare shoulder, her hand lazily tracing idle patterns along the slope of Rio’s collarbone.

Neither of them spoke.

They didn’t need to.

It was the kind of silence that felt earned—warm, settled, right.

Rio exhaled a slow, contented breath, her arm wrapped loosely around Agatha’s waist.

“Is this really happening?” Rio murmured, her voice soft in the quiet room.

Agatha gave a low hum, tilting her head to press a slow kiss against the curve of Rio’s shoulder.

“It is,” she whispered back.

Rio smiled, her fingers brushing gently along Agatha’s spine.

“I keep waiting for someone to knock on the door and drag me back to reality.”

Agatha huffed a soft laugh. “If anyone knocks on this door, it will be Wanda.”

Rio chuckled, shifting to kiss the top of Agatha’s head. “And she’ll be carrying a list, a quill, and absolutely no intention of asking our opinions.”

Agatha smirked, tilting her face up toward Rio’s. “We’ll be lucky if she doesn’t start stitching our initials onto the linens herself.”

Rio laughed, the sound warm and easy.

Agatha’s smile softened. “We’re doomed.”

Rio met her eyes, brushing a lock of hair back from her face.

“Happily,” she whispered.

Agatha kissed her again—slow, sweet, sure.

And for a long, quiet moment… they let themselves believe in this.

Later that morning…

The engagement news began its quiet ripple through their social circles—

A subtle mention at the club.
A whispered word over tea.
A soft, surprised murmur at the morning market.

Not a grand announcement.

But enough.

Enough for the world to know…

And more than enough for Evanora Harkness to hear.
=======
At a high-society breakfast salon on the west side of London—
Where the tea was strong, the gossip stronger, and the company meticulously selected—

Evanora Harkness sat perfectly poised at the head of a pale silk settee, gloved hands resting atop her ivory cane.

Her silver hair was swept back in an unforgiving knot, every line of her face drawn sharp with years of disdainful observation.

She listened—carefully, quietly—
As the ladies murmured over their cups, words drifting on polite, venom-laced laughter.

“…and to think, Agatha Harkness… engaged. To a gentleman scholar, no less.”

Evanora’s hand stilled on her cane.

“Engaged?” she repeated, her voice soft, almost amused.

The woman beside her—one of those simpering sorts Evanora could never quite remember the name of—nodded eagerly.

“Oh, yes. Quite the surprise, isn’t it? After all these years of her independence. We all thought she’d—well…” The woman gave a delicate little shrug. “Outgrow it.”

Evanora’s lips curved into something that could almost be called a smile.

Outgrow it.

That had been the assumption, hadn’t it?

She’d let Agatha go easily enough—convinced the girl would either crawl back on her knees or fade quietly into spinsterhood, her unnatural pride shriveled by a world that did not suffer such things in women.

But this?

A proper engagement?

To a man of standing?

Interesting.

Evanora stirred her tea with deliberate calm, her mind already shifting through possibilities.

If Agatha had finally come to her senses…
If this fiancé of hers proved worthy…

Perhaps there was hope for the Harkness name yet.

And if not—

Evanora smiled faintly, her eyes dark with quiet calculation.

Well.

She would simply have to see for herself.


=======
The Maximoff sitting room was warm with the soft clink of china and low conversation.

Wanda poured tea with practiced elegance, Vision beside her reading quietly, and Rio and Agatha settled close on the settee—just close enough that their hands brushed when they reached for their cups.

It was quiet.
It was safe.

It was theirs.

Until—

The door opened.

Without a knock.

A footman appeared in the doorway, his face pale, his eyes wide with something dangerously close to alarm.

“Lady Evanora Harkness,” he announced, voice just a little too high.

Every head turned.

And there she stood.

Evanora.

Tall despite her years, dressed in the richest black silk, her silver hair pinned back in a knot that might have been a weapon, her cane tapping softly against the polished floor.

Her eyes swept the room once—sharp, cold, assessing.

They lingered on Agatha.

Softened—just slightly—when they slid over Rio.

And narrowed when they settled on Wanda.

“Agatha,” Evanora said smoothly, her voice honeyed with practiced civility. “You do keep the most… interesting company.”

Rio was on her feet in an instant, stepping instinctively between Evanora and Agatha—her hand at Agatha’s wrist, light but firm.

Agatha rose slowly behind her, her spine straightening, though her eyes flashed with something dangerously close to panic.

“Mother.”

The word came out flat, brittle around the edges.

Wanda stood too—carefully setting her cup aside, her expression sharp as glass.

“Lady Evanora,” Wanda said with a smile that didn’t touch her eyes. “To what do we owe the… pleasure?”

Evanora’s lips curved faintly.

“I thought,” she said delicately, “that I might pay my only daughter a visit. After all… it’s not every day a Harkness finds herself engaged to a man of standing.”

Her eyes flicked to Rio—considering, appraising.

“And I do so like to meet the ones who surprise me.”

Vision—who had quietly set down his book—rose smoothly to his feet.

“Perhaps we should all sit,” Vision said gently, his voice a calm anchor in the crackling tension. “I’m sure Lady Evanora didn’t come all this way for introductions in the doorway.”

Evanora’s eyes flicked to him—assessing.

Then she smiled.

“Of course.”

And with a grace that felt less like politeness and more like a carefully measured move on a chessboard—

She stepped inside.

And the world Agatha and Rio had been building shifted…

On the edge of something entirely new.
=======
They sat in a perfect mockery of civility.

Evanora perched at the far end of the settee, her posture impeccable, her cane resting delicately against her knee.

Agatha sat beside Rio, shoulders squared, chin lifted—
But her hands were folded too tightly in her lap.

Wanda settled across from them, her expression the picture of hostess grace…
Except for the glint in her eyes that promised nothing good.

Vision remained standing just behind Wanda’s chair, silent but watchful.

The tea tray sat untouched between them.

Evanora spoke first.

“I had begun to wonder if I’d see you again, Agatha.”

Her voice was smooth, almost pleasant—like fine silk drawn tight enough to cut.

Agatha gave a slow, measured nod. “I hadn’t thought a visit necessary.”

Evanora hummed softly, glancing around the room. “And yet… here we are.”

Her eyes slid pointedly to Rio, resting on her with a gaze sharp enough to flay.

“I must say… I hadn’t expected a scholar. Though I suppose, in some circles, that passes for a suitable match these days.”

Rio felt Agatha tense beside her—

But before Agatha could speak, Rio offered a small, polite smile.

“Not everyone enjoys the clarity of low expectations, Lady Harkness.”

Evanora’s brows lifted, her lips curving faintly.

“Oh… sharp.”

Her gaze drifted back to Agatha. “You’ve always had a taste for difficult company.”

Agatha’s lips parted—whether to defend or lash back, Rio wasn’t sure—

But Rio reached for her hand beneath the folds of her skirt, giving it a gentle, grounding squeeze.

Agatha’s fingers curled around hers.

Wanda spoke next—her tone light as air.

“Rio’s reputation precedes her.” She took a slow sip of tea. “And her company is always… enlightening.”

Vision, behind her, gave a faint hum of agreement.

Evanora’s eyes flicked between them—assessing, calculating.

And then, softly—

“Well. It seems you’ve made quite the… circle for yourself, Agatha.”

Her smile didn’t reach her eyes.

Agatha inhaled slowly, her voice even.

“I’ve made a life for myself.”

Evanora tilted her head, her expression softening into something almost… considering.

“Perhaps.”

She glanced at Rio again, her voice dropping into something almost curious.

“I’ll enjoy seeing whether this little arrangement of yours lasts.”

Her tone wasn’t cruel—

But it didn’t need to be.

And yet—

Instead of bristling, Rio met her gaze head-on, her voice soft but steady.

“It will.”

For a moment—just a flicker—Evanora’s expression faltered.

And something in the air shifted.


=======
The conversation drifted — if it could be called that — a delicate exchange of pleasantries wrapped tightly around pointed remarks.

Evanora inquired, with icy civility, after Rio’s “lectures” and academic standing.

Rio responded with careful politeness, never rising to the bait, her words trimmed with the faintest edge of humor that Wanda seemed to enjoy far too much.

Vision chimed in occasionally with a soft observation, smoothing the sharpest moments with practiced ease.

And Agatha…

Agatha said little.

But when she did, her voice carried a steady, even tone—her hand never once slipping from Rio’s beneath the tablecloth.

It felt almost manageable.

Until—

“I must admit,” Evanora said lightly, lifting her teacup, “I never imagined you, of all people, would be tamed by a man, Agatha.”

The words hung in the air like a slap in velvet gloves.

Agatha stiffened, her lips parting—

But Rio answered first.

“Good thing, then,” Rio said calmly, her hand giving Agatha’s a subtle squeeze, “that taming her was never my intention.”

Evanora’s eyes flicked to her—sharp, considering.

And for a moment… a flicker of something unreadable passed across her face.

Then, as though the entire conversation had been nothing more than idle morning chatter—

Evanora set her teacup down, rose slowly from her chair, and smoothed the folds of her gloves.

“Well,” she said crisply, “I expect to see you both for dinner next week. I’ll have Cook prepare something fitting.”

She turned a cool smile toward Agatha.

“After all… it’s been far too long since we’ve properly welcomed you home.”

And before anyone could answer—

She turned and swept from the room with quiet, unhurried grace.

Leaving silence—and no small measure of stunned disbelief—in her wake.
=======
The door clicked softly shut behind Evanora, her footsteps fading into the hall.

The sitting room sat in stunned, brittle silence.

Agatha stared down at her untouched teacup, her back stiff, her jaw set—
Her hand still firmly wrapped in Rio’s beneath the table.

Rio remained perfectly still beside her, shoulders squared, her thumb stroking slow, deliberate circles against Agatha’s knuckles.

Vision let out a soft breath, reaching for the abandoned teapot with a calm that felt more like diplomacy than comfort.

And then—

“I don’t like her,” Wanda announced, her voice sharp as glass.

Agatha let out a soft, breathless laugh—part disbelief, part relief.

Rio huffed a quiet, amused sound. “That’s generous.”

Wanda set her teacup down with a little more force than necessary. “I would’ve said something, but I thought perhaps it wasn’t polite to throw a fork at a guest.”

Vision gave her a mild look. “Thank you for your restraint.”

Wanda gave him a saccharine smile. “For now.”

Agatha exhaled slowly, closing her eyes for a moment. “I… didn’t expect her to come.”

Wanda softened slightly, leaning forward. “Did you think she wouldn’t care?”

Agatha opened her eyes, glancing at Rio, her voice quieter now. “I thought… she’d write me off. Like she always has.”

Rio gave her hand a soft, grounding squeeze.

“She still might,” Rio said gently. “But not before she tries to get her claws in.”

Agatha turned her hand, linking their fingers together tightly.

“I won’t let her.”

Wanda gave them both a small, fierce smile. “Good.”

Vision poured a fresh cup of tea and offered it across the table.

“To surviving family dinners.”

Agatha took the cup, her lips quirking faintly.

“To surviving Evanora,” she murmured.

And Rio…

Rio didn’t say it aloud—

But her hand in Agatha’s said everything she needed to.


=======
The Maximoff house had settled back into its usual rhythm—
Which, for Rio and Agatha, meant slipping away to the privacy of Rio’s flat before dusk.

They sat together on the edge of the bed, their shoulders touching, both still dressed in their walking clothes but neither quite ready to move.

For a long, comfortable silence, they said nothing.

It was Agatha who broke it—her voice soft, wry.

“I half-expected you to leap over the tea tray.”

Rio smirked faintly, keeping her gaze on their hands—lightly linked in her lap. “I considered it.”

Agatha let out a soft breath, her thumb brushing gently over Rio’s knuckles.

“She’s not going to stop.”

“No.”

“She’s going to try to take you apart.”

Rio finally looked up, her eyes steady, warm. “She can try.”

Agatha gave a low, almost disbelieving laugh. “You didn’t even flinch.”

Rio turned slightly, their knees brushing. “Did you want me to?”

Agatha met her gaze—really looked—and after a long moment, she shook her head.

“No,” she whispered. “I didn’t.”

They sat in the soft hush of the room, hearts slowing, shoulders easing.

Rio reached up, tucking a stray curl behind Agatha’s ear. “We go to dinner.”

Agatha arched a brow. “You’re mad.”

Rio smiled. “We go. Together. We let her have her show.”

Agatha’s lips quirked, half skeptical, half curious. “And when she tries to tear me apart?”

Rio leaned in, her voice low, sure.

“Then we remind her… I’m not going anywhere. And neither are you.”

Agatha stared at her—

And then, slowly, her shoulders relaxed, her head tipping forward until it rested lightly against Rio’s.

“You’re going to ruin me,” Agatha murmured.

Rio closed her eyes, pressing a soft kiss to Agatha’s forehead.

“Not if I can help it.”
=======
“You’re going to ruin me,” Agatha murmured, her head still resting against Rio’s.

Rio smiled—slow, sure—her lips brushing the shell of Agatha’s ear as she whispered back,

“Only in the ways you enjoy.”

She felt Agatha shiver—
Felt her hands curl gently into the fabric of Rio’s shirt.

And then—

Rio shifted, her arms sliding around Agatha’s waist as she guided them both back onto the bed in one slow, fluid motion—

No urgency.
No rush.

Just them.

Agatha let herself be eased down, her hands never leaving Rio’s shoulders as Rio hovered over her, eyes dark with something deeper than want.

Rio leaned down, her lips brushing softly over Agatha’s.

“I’m going to take care of you,” Rio whispered against her mouth. “In every way I know how.”

Agatha exhaled a soft, shaky breath, her hands sliding up to cradle Rio’s face.

“You already do,” she whispered.

Rio kissed her—slow, lingering, reverent.

And then—

She took her time.

Her hands traced every inch of Agatha’s body with a kind of quiet devotion—
Gliding over soft curves, lingering at places that made Agatha’s breath catch, moving with a deliberate care that spoke louder than any vow.

Her lips followed—
Pressing slow kisses to Agatha’s collarbone…
To the hollow of her throat…
To the soft, sensitive skin just beneath her ribs…

And with every kiss—

“I love this.”
A kiss.
“And this.”
A brush of lips against a curve of hip.
“And you.”

Agatha gasped softly, her hands threading into Rio’s hair as Rio’s mouth moved lower, her touch worshipful, steady.

When Rio finally reached the place she knew Agatha needed her most, she didn’t rush—

She kissed her there.
Soft.
Certain.

And whispered—

“Mine.”

Agatha came apart in her hands—

But not shattered.

Opened.

Held.

Loved.

And when it was over, when Rio gathered her into her arms, pulling her close beneath the quiet hush of the evening light—

She kissed her temple, her voice a soft, steady promise.

“I will never let you fall alone.”

Agatha curled into her, her heart pounding, her walls softening—

And whispered back,

“I know.”
=======
They lay tangled in the soft, rumpled sheets—
Agatha’s head resting against Rio’s chest, her hand draped lazily over her waist.

The only sound between them was the slow, steady rhythm of Rio’s breathing…

And Agatha’s heart, finally beating calm beneath her ribs.

For a while, they said nothing.

It was enough to exist like this—skin to skin, hearts aligned, the weight of the world held at bay by the thin walls of Rio’s flat.

But then—

Agatha let out a soft, breathless laugh.

Rio glanced down at her, fingers brushing lightly along her back. “What is it?”

Agatha tilted her head, resting her chin against Rio’s shoulder, her smile soft but edged with something real.

“I don’t think I’ve ever… let someone take care of me before.”

Rio brushed a kiss against her hair. “You let me.”

Agatha gave a slow nod. “I think I wanted to… long before I realized it.”

Rio’s arms tightened around her.

“You don’t have to do everything alone, Agatha.”

Agatha hummed softly, her lips curving. “I know.”

She let her hand trail over the soft lines of Rio’s stomach, her touch light, thoughtful.

“I don’t want to lose myself,” Agatha whispered. “Not in this… not in you.”

Rio caught her hand gently, lifting it to press a kiss against her fingers.

“You won’t.”

Agatha looked up, meeting her gaze. “How can you be so sure?”

Rio smiled—soft, honest, sure.

“Because you’re the only person I’ve ever met strong enough to love someone without losing a single piece of herself.”

Agatha stared at her—

And felt something inside her settle…

In a way it never had before.

She leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to Rio’s lips—

And whispered against them,

“Neither will you.”

They lay like that—

Breathing.
Holding.

Loving.

Until the world pulled them back to it once again.
=======
The afternoon sun poured gently through the tall windows of the Maximoff townhouse, casting golden stripes across the sitting room floor.

Billy and Tommy sat cross-legged near the hearth, deep in an elaborate game involving a set of wooden soldiers, two mismatched dolls, and a surprisingly detailed paper fortress.

At the far end of the room, Wanda lounged in a chair, a bit of mending in her lap she wasn’t truly attending to.

Agatha perched on the edge of the settee, a cup of tea cooling in her hands.

The soft murmur of the twins’ game filled the air—

But between Wanda and Agatha… a different kind of quiet settled.

Wanda gave her a sidelong glance. “She’s giving a lecture today?”

Agatha nodded, her lips curving faintly. “First in a series, apparently. Vision arranged it.”

Wanda hummed softly. “So… you’ve got her giving public lectures, facing down your mother, and entirely wrapped around your little finger.”

Agatha gave a soft, sardonic smile. “I’ve barely done a thing.”

Wanda lifted a brow, setting her mending aside. “You’re adorable when you lie.”

Agatha let out a soft laugh, setting her tea down. “She asked me to marry her, Wanda.”

Wanda’s expression softened into something rare—real, quiet fondness.

“I know,” she said softly. “I’ve never seen her look at anyone the way she looks at you.”

Agatha looked down at her hands, tracing the rim of her cup.

“She’s brave,” she said quietly. “Braver than I am some days.”

Wanda reached over, resting her hand gently on Agatha’s.

“Then be brave for her.”

Agatha met her eyes.

Wanda’s smile turned sly. “And perhaps… plan a little.”

Agatha arched a brow. “Plan what?”

Wanda gave a delicate shrug. “The dinner with your mother. The engagement announcement. The future.”

Agatha’s lips quirked. “You mean scheme.”

Wanda squeezed her hand lightly. “What’s a future without a little scheming?”

Agatha exhaled a soft, genuine laugh—

And beside them, Billy and Tommy shouted triumphantly over a toppled paper fortress.

For a moment—just a moment—

Agatha allowed herself to believe in this future they were quietly stitching together.


=======
“…and if she thinks I’ll be cowed by a thinly veiled comment about family obligations,” Agatha muttered, “she clearly hasn’t been paying attention for the last decade.”

Wanda smirked, threading her needle with slow precision. “So we smile, we agree, and we let her hang herself with her own words.”

Agatha lifted her teacup in a mock toast. “And make sure there are witnesses.”

Wanda clinked her cup lightly against Agatha’s. “Vision’s good for that. No one ever questions the quiet ones.”

Agatha chuckled low in her throat. “And you?”

Wanda gave a slow, wicked smile. “Oh, I’ll be the charming friend who says exactly what everyone’s thinking… in the nicest possible way.”

They exchanged a look—sharp, conspiratorial—

Which was precisely when the front door opened with a soft click.

Footsteps.

And then—

Rio appeared in the doorway, coat still on, brow lifted slightly at the sight of the two of them sitting with their heads bent close, tea cups in hand, unmistakable plotting energy in the air.

She crossed her arms, smirking. “Should I be worried?”

Agatha glanced up at her—her lips curling into a slow, feline smile.

“Always.”

Wanda gave Rio a mock-innocent look. “We’re planning your future, Professor. One dinner party at a time.”

Rio chuckled, stepping inside and setting her gloves on the table. “Should I ask?”

Agatha leaned back against the settee, her smile softening. “Evanora. Dinner. You know… light social suicide.”

Rio’s expression sobered slightly—
But then she crossed the room, leaned down, and pressed a soft, lingering kiss to Agatha’s temple.

“I wouldn’t miss it.”

Wanda arched a brow, sipping her tea. “We wouldn’t let you.”

Agatha met Rio’s eyes—

And in that quiet, steady look—

All three of them knew…

Whatever came next, they wouldn’t be facing it alone.


=======
The Harkness townhouse stood like a monument to another era—

Stone-faced, tall-windowed, and wrapped in the silent chill of old money and older grudges.

The carriage ride had been quiet, tense—but not with fear.

With resolve.

Agatha sat beside Rio, her gloved hand resting lightly over Rio’s, her chin lifted in the perfect picture of calm disdain.

Wanda and Vision sat across from them—Wanda wearing a smile so sharp it could cut glass, Vision the very image of serene diplomacy.

As they pulled up to the grand front steps, Rio leaned in slightly toward Agatha.

“Ready?”

Agatha gave her a slow, knowing smile. “To ruin her evening? Always.”

Wanda hummed softly. “Let’s make it a night to remember.”

They stepped out together—united.

The dinner began as expected—

Evanora greeted them at the door in a gown of severe black silk, her smile as sharp and brittle as bone china.

She greeted Rio first, offering her hand with a slight tilt of her head.

“Professor Vidal,” she said, her voice a silken drawl. “I’ve been most curious to see you… in your natural element.”

Rio took her hand lightly, offering a courtly bow. “I do hope I’ll meet expectations, Lady Harkness.”

Evanora’s lips twitched faintly. “I doubt anyone ever does.”

She turned to Agatha, her smile softening into something almost dangerous.

“Darling.”

Agatha met her gaze, cool and poised. “Mother.”

Evanora gave her a slow once-over—then gestured them inside.

“Let us begin, shall we?”

The first course passed in a polite blur—

Small talk. Weather. Rio’s lectures.

Evanora picked apart every detail with the delicate precision of a vulture inspecting its prey.

But Rio met her at every turn—
Calm.
Measured.
Unmoved.

And when Wanda chimed in—softly, sweetly—she turned every veiled barb into an opportunity to praise Agatha’s strength, Rio’s reputation, and Vision’s unimpeachable good sense.

By the second course, it was clear…

Evanora was being outplayed in her own parlor.

As the dessert was served, Evanora set down her spoon and folded her hands atop the pristine linen tablecloth.

Her gaze slid to Agatha.

“I must confess,” she said smoothly, “I never expected you to be content playing wife to a… gentleman scholar.”

Agatha lifted her cup—perfectly steady—and met her mother’s eyes.

“I’m not content.”

Evanora blinked. “No?”

Agatha smiled—slow, sure.

“I’m thrilled.”

Evanora opened her mouth—

But Wanda, voice soft as ever, leaned in with a pleasant smile.

“Isn’t it remarkable when a woman finds someone who sees her for all she is… and chooses her anyway?”

Vision hummed in agreement. “Quite.”

Evanora stared at them—

And for the first time…

She blinked.

Sat back.

And said nothing.


=======
The rest of the evening settled into a brittle, carefully orchestrated exchange of pleasantries—

Not warm.
Not even polite.

But neutral.

Which, considering the history between Agatha and Evanora, felt almost… surreal.

There were no sharp words.
No outright barbs.
No cutting remarks that drew blood.

Just the faint, clipped edge of a woman unused to losing ground—and too proud to admit it.

When the time came to leave, Evanora stood at the door, her hands folded neatly over her cane, her expression unreadable.

“Thank you for hosting us,” Vision offered with a slight bow—
The very image of courteous diplomacy.

Wanda gave a slow, elegant nod. “We’ll be sure to return the favor.”

Evanora’s lips twitched. “I look forward to it.”

When Rio offered her hand, Evanora took it with a faint, assessing glance.

“You’re a braver man than most, Professor.”

Rio smiled, calm and steady. “I take that as a compliment.”

Evanora’s lips curved faintly. “Perhaps it was.”

And when Agatha stepped forward—

Evanora met her eyes.

Said nothing.

And gave a slight, almost imperceptible nod.

Agatha inclined her head in return.

That was all.

No embrace.
No venom.
No parting shot.

Just… a nod.

And as they stepped out into the cool night air—

Agatha let out a soft, almost disbelieving breath.

Rio glanced at her, arching a brow. “That went… well?”

Agatha gave a soft, dry laugh. “By her standards? It was practically a blessing.”

Wanda linked her arm through Agatha’s with a slow, wicked grin. “Then let’s call it a win.”

And for the first time in years…

Agatha did.


=======
Back at Rio’s, the fire crackled low in the hearth, the soft amber light casting long shadows across the walls.

Agatha sat curled up on the settee, a glass of brandy in hand, her stockinged feet tucked beneath her.

Rio leaned against the mantel, watching her with that soft, steady look that never failed to make Agatha feel… seen.

For a long moment, they didn’t speak.

Finally, Agatha exhaled a soft breath.

“I don’t know if that was her giving in… or just regrouping.”

Rio tilted her head slightly. “Does it matter?”

Agatha gave a faint, dry smile. “You sound like Wanda.”

Rio chuckled low. “She’s growing on me.”

Agatha took a slow sip, her gaze dropping to the glass in her hand.

“I half expected her to throw me out. Or you.”

Rio crossed the room, settling beside her.

“She didn’t.”

Agatha glanced at her—met the quiet certainty in Rio’s eyes.

“No,” she murmured. “She didn’t.”

Rio reached over, threading their fingers together.

“And even if she tries again—”

Agatha squeezed her hand gently. “She won’t win.”

They sat there—hand in hand, the quiet hum of the fire wrapping around them—

Until Agatha set her glass down, leaned into Rio’s side, and let herself believe…

That maybe, just maybe—

They’d already won.0
=======
The university corridors bustled with the usual mix of scholars, students, and stiff-collared faculty—

But today…

Rio noticed the glances.
The nods.
The faint smiles of polite approval from men who had, until now, barely offered her more than a curt greeting.

It started with Dr. Pembroke, an elder professor known more for his love of tradition than his love of students.

“Ah—Vidal,” Pembroke said as they passed outside the lecture hall, offering a rare nod. “Congratulations. I hear you’ve secured quite the match.”

Rio blinked. “Thank you… sir.”

Pembroke gave a faint, approving hum. “A clever woman is an asset—provided she knows her place.”

Rio smiled—tight, professional. “Indeed.”

She walked on.

It continued.

Professor Hartley, the head of ancient studies, clapped her on the shoulder with a boisterous laugh.

“Didn’t think you the type for domesticity, Vidal!” he chuckled. “But I suppose even the wild ones settle down, eh?”

Rio gave him a pleasant, even look. “Or perhaps I’ve found someone wild enough to match me.”

Hartley blinked—then laughed again, shaking his head as he walked off.

And finally—

Dean Everard himself stopped her just outside the main hall, his expression cool but not unfriendly.

“I trust your… personal affairs won’t distract from your lectures,” he said.

Rio met his gaze, her voice calm, even. “On the contrary, sir. I believe they’ll only make me better at them.”

Everard gave her a slow, assessing look.

And then…

He nodded.

“Carry on.”

As Rio moved down the hall toward her lecture room—

She let out a soft, quiet laugh.

They had no idea.

And she wouldn’t give them the satisfaction of learning any different.

Not yet.


=======
Afternoon tea at Madame Selwyn’s — a known haunt for the quietly powerful women of London.

Agatha sipped her tea at a corner table, a soft hum of conversation around her.

It wasn’t long before she noticed it—

The glances.
The faint smiles.
The subtle tilt of heads in her direction.

She kept her expression carefully neutral.

“Agatha Harkness.”

The voice came light, sweetly curious.

She turned—

Margaret Fontaine, a woman of old lineage and sharper instincts, approached with a soft smile.

“I’d heard the most delightful rumor,” Margaret said, her eyes glinting with curiosity. “But I wasn’t certain until I saw you.”

Agatha gave her a polite smile. “And what rumor would that be?”

Margaret leaned in slightly. “That you’ve accepted a proposal.”

A ripple of soft interest stirred in the nearby conversation.

Agatha took a slow sip of tea. “I have.”

Margaret’s eyes widened just slightly—genuine surprise.

“Well,” she said warmly, “it’s about time.”

A soft murmur of agreement swept through the table beside them.

“I’d always said,” Margaret continued, her smile turning conspiratorial, “that it would take a very particular sort of man to win you.”

Agatha’s lips curved faintly. “Or perhaps… someone very particular indeed.”

Margaret gave a soft, knowing laugh. “Whichever the case, I hope he knows how lucky he is.”

Agatha met her eyes—steady, certain.

“Oh… he does.”

Across the room, another voice murmured—

“About time Agatha Harkness found someone to keep up with her.”

And for once—

Agatha didn’t feel the sting of being a subject of society’s curiosity.

She felt… amused.

And maybe, just maybe—

A little bit proud.


=======
Evening settled over Rio’s flat, a quiet warmth lingering between them as they shared a late supper—nothing formal, just bread, cheese, and a bottle of wine Wanda had “accidentally” left behind.

They ate on the settee, knees brushing, shoulders pressed together—

And finally…

Rio smirked into her glass. “So… apparently, I’m quite the man about town.”

Agatha arched a brow, setting down her half-eaten slice of bread. “Oh?”

Rio chuckled low. “I’ve been congratulated three times today. Told I’d finally settled down. Praised for taming the infamous Miss Harkness.”

Agatha gave a soft, incredulous laugh. “Taming?”

Rio leaned in, her voice dropping into a teasing murmur. “You know. Bringing you to heel.”

Agatha smirked, leaning closer. “Is that what you’re doing?”

Rio kissed the corner of her mouth. “Hardly.”

Agatha shook her head, laughing softly. “You should’ve seen the women at Selwyn’s. You’d think I’d just won some society lottery.”

Rio blinked. “Really?”

Agatha gave her a slow, sly smile. “Apparently, I’ve surprised everyone. And for once… not in a way that earned a scandal.”

Rio let out a soft, genuine laugh. “Imagine that.”

They sat there for a moment—leaning into each other, sharing the warmth of mutual disbelief.

And then—

Agatha exhaled a soft breath. “It’s strange.”

Rio glanced at her, brows lifting slightly. “What is?”

Agatha toyed with the edge of her wine glass. “Feeling… like I finally fit. Even if they don’t know the truth.”

Rio’s fingers brushed lightly over Agatha’s hand. “I know the truth.”

Agatha met her eyes—steady, soft, open.

“And that’s all I’ve ever needed.”

They leaned in, their foreheads resting together, hearts beating in quiet rhythm.

No masks.
No lies between them.

Just this.

Their world.

And, for the first time, a place in it they chose—together.
=======
The Maximoff townhouse glittered beneath the soft glow of a hundred candles—

The scent of fresh flowers lingered in the air, mingling with the low hum of music and the soft rustle of silk gowns and tailored coats.

Wanda had outdone herself.

The guest list read like a quiet who's who of London society—politicians, scholars, patrons of the arts—
All carefully chosen…
All whispered to in advance.

This wasn’t a ball.
It wasn’t even a formal dinner.

It was a gathering.

A statement.

And at the center of it—

Rio and Agatha stood side by side, the very image of composed partnership.

Rio in a finely tailored dark coat, her cravat tied with precision, her posture easy but commanding.

Agatha in a gown of deep violet satin, her hair swept back with soft, artful curls, a glint of amethyst at her throat.

They moved together through the crowd—

Pausing for quiet congratulations…
Offering polite smiles…
Enduring the occasional too-curious glance with a shared, secret look.

And Wanda, of course, flitted through it all—

Smiling, laughing, subtly guiding conversations, ensuring no one dared speak a word out of turn.

At one point, as Rio accepted yet another glass of wine from a passing attendant, Wanda sidled up beside her with a slow, pleased smile.

“Perfect, isn’t it?” she murmured.

Rio glanced at Agatha, watching as she conversed easily with a well-connected patron.

“More than.”

Wanda’s eyes sparkled. “They’ll never see you coming.”

Rio gave a soft, knowing smile. “I’d rather they see us.”

Wanda patted her arm with mock sweetness. “Oh, they will.”


=======
The evening flowed smoothly—
A sea of polite conversation, soft music, and carefully managed attention.

Agatha had just excused herself from a particularly tedious conversation with Lady Bellamy when she caught sight of Rio standing near the garden doors, half-listening to Vision explain something about parliamentary reform.

And then—

A ripple.

A subtle shift in the room—so slight most would have missed it.

But Agatha didn’t.

And neither did Rio.

The crowd near the entry shifted, parting just slightly as a new arrival stepped into the light of the grand hall—

A tall, dark-haired man in a sharply cut coat.

His eyes swept the room with quiet, assessing ease.

And when they landed on Rio—

He smiled.

Not a warm smile.
Not a friendly one.

A smile of recognition.

Of history.

Agatha’s hand tightened on the edge of her glass.

Vision turned, giving a polite nod. “Dean Holloway. I wasn’t aware you’d been invited.”

Holloway.

The name landed hard—an academic figure, known for his influence in London’s scholarly circles… and, if rumors were true, a man who didn’t much care for anyone upsetting the carefully guarded traditions of the university.

And judging by the way he looked at Rio—

There was nothing cordial in it.

“Word travels quickly,” Holloway said smoothly, his eyes never leaving Rio. “Especially when a professor of… uncommon background becomes the subject of such public interest.”

Rio straightened—her smile cool, her posture easy.

“Dean Holloway,” she said evenly. “To what do I owe the pleasure?”

Holloway’s gaze flicked briefly to Agatha—then back to Rio.

“Curiosity,” he said lightly. “And perhaps… a bit of professional concern.”

Agatha stepped forward, her voice low, edged.

“Be careful, Dean. You wouldn’t want to mistake curiosity for something less civil.”

Holloway’s smile barely shifted.

“I see,” he murmured. “How very… modern of you.”

He gave a slight, mocking bow—

And disappeared back into the crowd as quickly as he’d come.

Leaving behind a thread of tension that hummed low between them.
=======
The crowd ebbed back into polite conversation, Holloway swallowed by the tide of glittering guests.

Agatha stood beside Rio, her hand slipping naturally into Rio’s—steady, sure.

They said nothing for a long moment, letting the soft hum of the party swell around them.

Finally, Rio exhaled a soft breath. “Well. That was… something.”

Agatha glanced sideways at her, a slow, amused smile tugging at her lips. “You handled him beautifully.”

Rio gave a soft snort. “I think you handled him beautifully.”

Agatha squeezed her hand gently. “I’d rather not waste another thought on him.”

Rio turned to face her fully, her expression softening. “Neither would I.”

Agatha’s thumb brushed over Rio’s knuckles, slow and deliberate.

“We’ve nothing to prove, Rio. Not to Holloway. Not to my mother. Not to anyone.”

Rio’s eyes met hers—steady, clear. “We already have everything we need.”

Agatha’s lips curved into a soft, quiet smile. “Yes. We do.”

They leaned in, foreheads resting gently together—

A quiet affirmation.

And in that simple, grounding touch, every shadow of doubt slipped away.
=======
A few mornings later, with Rio at the university and the twins off on some supervised adventure with Vision, Agatha sat in the sunlit Maximoff drawing room—

A cup of tea in hand, her eyes following the delicate movements of Wanda as she arranged fresh flowers on the sideboard.

“You’re quiet,” Wanda said, not looking up.

Agatha smirked faintly. “Enjoy it while it lasts.”

Wanda shot her a look over her shoulder—half fondness, half knowing.

Setting the vase down, Wanda crossed the room and settled beside her.

They sat in companionable silence for a beat before Wanda spoke softly—

“I’m proud of you.”

Agatha blinked. “For what?”

Wanda gave her a small, genuine smile. “For not running.”

Agatha looked down at her tea, her lips quirking. “I thought about it.”

Wanda reached over, resting a hand gently on hers. “But you didn’t.”

Agatha exhaled a soft breath. “No. I didn’t.”

A pause—

And then Agatha’s hand closed lightly over Wanda’s.

“Thank you,” she said quietly. “For everything.”

Wanda squeezed her hand gently. “Always.”

They sat there—two women who’d fought their own quiet wars—

And let the peace between them settle.

Two days later…

The sitting room transformed into Wanda’s personal command center—

Bolts of fabric draped over chairs, guest lists unfurled across the table, flower samples scattered in organized chaos.

Agatha stood near the window, trying—and failing—not to smile as Wanda rattled off floral arrangements, seating charts, and acceptable gown styles at a rapid-fire pace.

Rio entered midway through a heated debate about violets versus white lilacs.

She leaned casually against the doorframe, watching with quiet amusement as Agatha gave up all pretense of control and handed Wanda the seating chart.

Wanda shot Rio a grin. “You’ve no idea what you’re in for.”

Rio smirked, crossing to stand behind Agatha, her hands resting gently on her waist.

“I’m counting on it.”

Agatha turned her head slightly, catching Rio’s eye with a soft, secret smile.

Wanda looked between them—

And for once, simply beamed.


=======
The morning of the wedding dawned bright and soft, a rare London sky painted in shades of gold and pale blue.

The house bustled with quiet excitement—Wanda overseeing last-minute details, Vision herding the twins, guests beginning to arrive.

But Agatha found a rare, still moment tucked away in the library—

Where Rio waited, standing near the window, the sunlight casting soft shadows across the lines of her coat.

For a moment, Agatha simply watched her—this impossible, infuriating, brilliant woman who had somehow become hers.

Rio turned, her smile softening as she met Agatha’s gaze.

“I thought we weren’t supposed to see each other before the ceremony,” Rio teased gently.

Agatha smirked. “I thought we never did what we were supposed to.”

Rio chuckled low. “Fair.”

Agatha stepped closer, slipping her hand into Rio’s.

And from her pocket, she drew out a simple, delicate chain—

A slender silver necklace, its pendant a tiny amethyst set in a circle of pale gold.

Rio blinked. “Agatha…”

Agatha pressed it into her hand, her voice soft.

“For you. So you always have something of me… with you.”

Rio stared at it for a long, breathless moment—

And then met Agatha’s eyes, her voice low.

“I have all of you.”

Agatha swallowed hard, her smile softening. “Yes. You do.”

Without another word, Rio slipped the chain around her neck—tucking it beneath her shirt, close to her heart.

Then—

She reached into her coat pocket and drew out a small velvet box.

Agatha’s brow lifted, a slow smile curving her lips.

Rio opened it to reveal a slender silver ring—simple, elegant, engraved inside with the word always.

“For you,” Rio said softly. “So you never forget you’re not alone anymore.”

Agatha took it, her fingers trembling slightly as she slid it onto her right hand.

She looked up, meeting Rio’s gaze—

And whispered, “I won’t.”

Rio leaned in, pressing a soft kiss to her forehead.

“We’re ready.”

Agatha smiled, leaning into her.

“Yes… we are.”
=======
The small chapel glowed with soft candlelight, the air humming with quiet reverence.

Guests filled the pews—close friends, colleagues, those few in society who mattered and mattered to them.

At the front stood Vision, poised and dignified in his formal coat, serving not only as the officiant but the quiet anchor of this unconventional gathering.

Wanda sat in the front pew with Billy and Tommy—both scrubbed clean and fidgeting in their tiny formal coats—her smile soft, her eyes shining with barely contained pride.

And among the pews, seated with the imperious posture of a woman who had not been asked but had certainly chosen to be there—

Evanora Harkness.

Dressed in deep plum, her cane resting against the pew, her expression unreadable.

But she was there.

She had come.

When Rio entered, flanked by Vision, a soft murmur rippled through the crowd.

Tall, composed, every inch the scholar and partner the world believed her to be—

She stood waiting at the front, her heart pounding, her eyes never leaving the aisle.

And then—

Agatha.

Stepping into the chapel on Wanda’s arm, her gown a deep violet silk edged in silver lace.

No veil.
No bowing head.

Just Agatha—strong, radiant, eyes locked on the woman waiting for her.

Wanda gave her arm a soft squeeze, a whispered, “Go on,” before stepping aside.

Agatha walked the aisle alone—

Not because she was alone.

But because she had chosen this.

Them.

As she reached Rio, they met each other’s eyes—

And everything else fell away.

Vision spoke the words, soft and measured.

They exchanged vows—not flowery, not rehearsed—

But theirs.

Quiet promises of partnership, of choice, of always finding their way back to each other.

And when Vision pronounced them—

Partners.

Wives.

Family.

The chapel echoed with soft applause…

And, if Agatha wasn’t mistaken—

The faintest nod from Evanora.


=======
By the time the guests filtered from the chapel to the Maximoff townhouse for the reception, Wanda was in her element.

The parlor had been transformed—
Soft music drifting from a quartet in the corner, champagne flowing like water, an elegant spread of food laid out with casual perfection.

But more than that…

Wanda worked the room like a master conductor.

She introduced Agatha and Rio to every guest who mattered—subtly weaving them into conversations about politics, philosophy, and the arts.

She charmed the skeptics.
She disarmed the gossips.
She ensured no one dared whisper a word against them that wasn’t immediately met with quiet, damning social disapproval.

And when Evanora arrived—standing near the mantel with a glass of champagne and a look of cool detachment—

Wanda glided past her with a soft, knowing smile.

“Lovely evening, isn’t it?” she murmured as she passed.

Evanora gave her a sharp, sidelong glance—

But said nothing.

And Wanda…

Wanda simply smiled.

Because Evanora being here meant Wanda had already won.
=======
The toasts began with Vision, ever the gentleman, offering a few heartfelt words about friendship, loyalty, and the quiet strength of choosing one’s family.

Wanda followed—

Her words sharp, sweet, and peppered with just enough playful commentary to make the room laugh and Rio blush.

The crowd lifted their glasses, a soft hum of approval rolling through the room.

And then—

A chair scraped softly against the polished floor.

All eyes turned as Evanora Harkness rose—

Her glass in hand, her expression composed but… softened.

Slightly.

She didn’t ask for attention.

She didn’t have to.

“I have never been one for sentiment,” Evanora began, her voice even, her gaze sweeping the room—
Before settling, finally, on Agatha.

“I raised a daughter who refused every expectation set before her.”

A faint ripple of laughter stirred—and died just as quickly.

Evanora’s lips curved—just a fraction.

“And though I did not understand her choices… I can say now—”

Her eyes shifted, landing squarely on Rio.

“—that perhaps she has made the right one.”

A soft, collective exhale passed through the room.

Evanora lifted her glass, her voice low but carrying.

“To Agatha. And to the unexpected paths that… occasionally… lead somewhere worthwhile.”

She raised her glass—

And, after a beat—

The room followed.

Agatha, for one impossible second, stared at her mother—

And then gave a slow, almost stunned smile.

She lifted her own glass.

“To the unexpected,” Agatha said softly.

Beside her, Rio reached for her hand beneath the table, their fingers entwining.

And for the first time in her life—

Agatha Harkness felt… seen.
=======
The reception wound down slowly, laughter softening into quiet conversation, guests filtering toward the doors with murmured farewells.

Agatha stepped onto the rear terrace for a breath of air—

Only to find Evanora already there.

She stood by the stone balustrade, one hand resting lightly on her cane, her gaze fixed on the gardens beyond.

For a long moment, Agatha considered turning back.

But then—

Evanora spoke, her voice low.

“You’re stronger than I gave you credit for.”

Agatha folded her arms, leaning slightly against the doorframe. “That’s because you never looked past what you wanted me to be.”

Evanora glanced at her, something flickering behind her cool eyes.

“I thought I was protecting you.”

Agatha met her gaze—steady, unwavering. “You weren’t.”

A pause.

Evanora nodded once, slow. “Perhaps not.”

The quiet stretched—thin, taut, but not entirely hostile.

Finally, Evanora spoke again, softer this time.

“He… seems to suit you.”

Agatha’s lips twitched, though her eyes didn’t soften. “She does.”

Evanora’s mouth pressed into a thin line—

But after a beat, she gave a slow nod. “So I’ve gathered.”

Another long, charged silence.

Then—

Evanora’s eyes turned back to the gardens.

“You’ll do well enough. Harkness blood tends to rise when it must.”

Agatha arched a brow. “That’s what you’re calling this? Rising?”

Evanora’s lips curved faintly. “Surviving.”

Agatha stared at her—

And for once, didn’t feel the familiar sting of anger.

Only… understanding.

A bitter, complicated thread of it.

They would never agree.
They would never truly see each other.

But maybe—

They didn’t have to.

Agatha nodded once, slow and measured.

“I’m not you.”

Evanora met her eyes.

And—

“Good.”

It wasn’t an apology.

But it was the closest either of them had ever come.
=======
The house had finally quieted.

The last guests gone.
The last well-wishes given.
Even Wanda and Vision had left them to the soft hush of their wedding night.

In Rio’s flat—
Their flat, now—

The fire burned low, casting a soft glow across the room as Agatha stood before the hearth, fingers toying absently with the delicate chain around her neck.

She felt Rio’s presence before she heard her—

Soft footsteps across the rug, a familiar warmth at her back.

Rio slid her arms gently around Agatha’s waist, resting her chin on her shoulder.

“Hello, wife,” Rio whispered, her voice low, warm.

Agatha smirked, her heart giving a soft, happy jolt. “That’ll take some getting used to.”

Rio pressed a slow kiss to her neck. “Not for me.”

Agatha turned in her arms—

And they kissed—

Soft at first.
Then deeper.
Hotter.

A kiss that spoke of everything they hadn’t said aloud—
And everything they’d promised each other.

They moved together toward the bed, hands unfastening buttons, sliding fabric away with unhurried reverence.

No masks.
No pretense.

Just them.

When Agatha sank back against the pillows, her hair spilling loose across the linen, Rio followed her down—

Hovering just above, her hand sliding gently along Agatha’s thigh, over the curve of her hip.

“You are,” Rio murmured, her lips brushing softly against Agatha’s collarbone, “everything I never knew I needed.”

Agatha shivered, her hands threading into Rio’s hair.

“And you are,” she whispered back, “mine.”

They made love slowly—

With soft gasps and whispered promises, lips tracing familiar paths, hands learning each other all over again.

It was sweet—
And it was hot—
And it burned with the fierce, unspoken certainty that whatever the world threw at them…

They would face it together.

They would choose each other.

Again.
And again.
Always.

And when the fire died to embers and they lay tangled in each other’s arms, hearts steady, skin warm—

Agatha kissed the curve of Rio’s shoulder and whispered,

“Our future’s ours now.”

Rio smiled against her hair.

“It always was.”


=======
London, early spring.

The halls of St. Aldwyn’s College echoed faintly with the low murmur of lectures and the soft tread of students’ footsteps.

In one of its sunlit classrooms, Rio closed her lecture notes with a soft smile, answering a last question before dismissing her students—

Most of whom still left the room debating the finer points of her latest discourse.

She gathered her papers, stepped out into the corridor—

And found Agatha waiting for her.

Dressed in a deep plum walking gown, her hair pinned in elegant simplicity, a faint smudge of ink at her wrist from morning lessons.

Rio’s heart gave the familiar, quiet twist it always did when she saw her wife like this—composed, radiant, entirely hers.

“Come for lunch?” Rio asked, smiling.

Agatha’s lips quirked—an odd, unreadable expression flickering in her eyes.

“I’ve had a letter.”

Rio’s brow lifted slightly. “From…?”

Agatha exhaled slowly, holding out the folded parchment.

Rio took it, scanning the elegant, clipped script.

Lady Evanora Harkness… deceased.

Estate… heir…

Rio’s eyes widened. “She left everything to you.”

Agatha gave a soft, dry laugh. “Apparently, even in death, she knows how to be a surprise.”

Rio glanced back at the letter. “And this… Nicholas?”

Agatha nodded, crossing her arms loosely. “A distant relation. Evanora took him in when his parents died. More an inconvenience than a ward, if I know her.”

Rio looked up, meeting Agatha’s gaze. “And now he’s ours?”

Agatha’s lips softened, her voice quiet. “Now… he’s ours.”

A long beat of silence—

And then Rio smiled, stepping close to slide her hand gently into Agatha’s.

“Seems fitting. The Harkness name… carried forward with care this time.”

Agatha squeezed her hand, her smile soft but sure.

“With love this time.”

And as they stood together in the sunlit corridor—

Their lives fuller than either of them had imagined—

They knew whatever came next…

They would face it together.
