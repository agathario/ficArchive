<p>Summary</p>
<blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“Oh, and one more thing.” Her tone shifts almost instantly. “I loved Dawn, but let's be real—you were a <em>terrible</em> crier.”</p>
<p>Agatha’s mouth falls open.</p>
<p>“Like, really terrible. Your tears weren’t even and your sobs sounded awful. I didn't know if you were acting or having a stroke. It was honestly painful to watch.”</p>
<p><em>This little shit.</em></p>
<p>“I’ve always wondered how you won that Emmy.. Was it a pity prize?” She blinks at Agatha with feigned innocence as if she did not just verbally eviscerated the older woman before her.</p>
<p>“Anyway,” She continues breezily without missing a beat, “I’m <em>Rae</em>.”</p>
<p>Agatha snaps and grabs the opportunity by clearing her throat, desperate to redeem herself.  “Right. <em>Rae</em>.” She lets the name roll on her tongue. “Is it short for.. 'Rae-who-should-really-watch-her-mouth-around-adults,' <em>that</em> Rae?”</p>
<p>“No.” Rae smirks. “It’s short for.. 'Rae-the-daughter-you-gave-up-for-adoption-sixteen years-ago,' <em>that</em> Rae.”</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Agatha’s world turns upside down when a young girl named Rae claims to be the daughter she abandoned—all unbeknownst to Rio, Rae’s adoptive mother.</p></blockquote>

<p align="center"><strong>RAE’S 16TH BIRTHDAY WISHLIST </strong></p><p>Dearest, mami</p><p>As you consider my wishes, please keep in mind that I am consistent with having good grades at school. I am also a decent human being who is courteous, polite, and respectful.</p><p>All that thanks to <em>you. </em></p><p>You have managed to singlehandedly raise me with good values. You molded me to become the <em>woman</em> that I am today (Yes, Mami.. woman, although we both know I am and will always be your baby no matter how old I get.)</p><p>With that said, also remember that I am the sweetest, kindest, cutest, and most loving angel in your life.</p><ol>
<li>New phone — A phone is a necessity in this time of day, and mine is an artifact. It's cracked all over the screen, laggy, and probably created during the time of Adam and Eve. It is outdated and it barely charges to 100%. I believe I have been patient for so long that I earned to have an upgrade now.</li>
<li>A tattoo (The art can be negotiable, you're allowed to express your input or veto anything) — I know you said that I must wait until my frontal lobe develops, but I strongly believe that I have already entered the right age and mental capacity for a permanent ink anywhere in my body. Fuck the frontal lobe. Sorry. But really, I feel like I don’t need to wait any longer until it actually <em>develops.</em> I promise there will be no laser-removal requests anytime soon if you let me get one tattoo. Or <em>two</em> tattoos<em>.</em></li>
<li>Public social media accounts — All content will be kid friendly, wholesome, and <em>Mami-approved.</em> I'm more than equipped and ready to have followers on my accounts other than you, Aunt Wanda, the twins, and my best friends.</li>
<li>Acting school or acting gig — You say that you'll never get tired of supporting my dreams and endeavors. This is one of them! You know I have always been passionate about acting and maybe, it's time to go beyond school plays. I left pamphlets in your left bedside drawer, you are free to browse them at your convenience.</li>
<li><strike>Other mother</strike> ??? The woman who gave birth to me — Mami, I love you with all my heart can give and more. You are the most important person in my life, and I wouldn’t change that for the world but sometimes.. sometimes I wonder.</li>
</ol><p>And I want to <em>stop</em> wondering. I want to quiet those voices at the back of my mind once and for all.</p><p>When I was younger, I recall you telling me that I can ask anytime. I wasn’t ready then and frankly, I had no intentions of ever exploring or knowing that part of me.</p><p>But, something has shifted. I think.. I do now. Or I am now.</p><p>I am <em>ready</em> now.</p><p>I want to know who she is :)</p><p> </p><p align="right">Love, Rae</p>

<p>If you tell 25 year old Agatha Harkness that one day, she will be back at the hell hole she spent her entire youth running away from, she’d laugh straight in your face and probably call you an idiot for even suggesting that idea.</p><p>The loathing she has for Westview, New Jersey can be traced back to the evil doings of her cunt mother. Thanks to that woman’s endless litany of sins, Agatha would gladly participate in a modern day lobotomy if it means erasing all the trauma that has been endured over the years under her mother’s neglect.</p><p>She’d burn her Emmy statuette or send an audition tape rather than willingly set foot in the place she was born and raised in (Agatha has reached a point in her career where she never auditions. Roles are either handed to her or <em>made</em> for her.)</p><p>After losing a bet she barely remembers agreeing to, Agatha is forcibly hauled back to the hellhole she swore she’d never return to sixteen years later, courtesy of her mentor, Lilia Calderu. And as if that isn’t punishment enough, Agatha has to help run Lilia’s workshop, teaching their craft to a bunch of hormonal teenagers or <em>spreading the word and art of the Lord,</em> as Lilia insists on calling it.</p><p>Lilia retired from the industry years prior. She now prides herself by sliding into a role of an acting coach. She travels across the country to share her expertise, educate aspiring young performers, and scout talents for the next generation.</p><p>The fates must have realized that it has been too good to Agatha for a long while that it has promptly decided to make her life a <em>little bit</em> miserable to balance it out. Lilia’s next stop just happens to be in Westview, New Jersey.</p><p>Sure, Agatha can always refuse and back out from the bet. She knows she could do that without jeopardizing her relationship with Lilia yet her ego tells her otherwise. Afterall, she is not but a woman of principles.. even when following them means walking straight back to the place she swore she’d never return to.</p><p>“We’re going out for dinner at 6:30.” Lilia barges inside the room she’s staying in for the next couple of weeks, carrying bath towels and neatly placing them at the edge of Agatha’s bed. “Tell me if you need anything and I will have Kate or the staff handle it for you.”</p><p>Agatha bats her eyelashes, “Can they book me the earliest flight back to Los Angeles?”</p><p>“That’s funny, Harkness.” Lilia deadpans. “You’re not leaving until the workshop concludes, and you know it.”</p><p>“Damn right I do.” She whispers, more to herself. “Though I would like to stay in rather than go out tonight. It’s chilly outside and you know just how awful my skin reacts to such horrendous temperature!”</p><p>Lilia looks at her suspiciously as Agatha pulls up the sleeve of her sweater, showing her bare arms.</p><p>“I was there when you were filming a scene that gave you an Oscar nomination in Alaska. You were wearing a <em>tube</em> top. I’m pretty sure you’ll do just fine to survive Westview weather.”</p><p>“Well, Alaska is different.”</p><p>“Exactly. Westview is more similar to Los Angeles therefore you won’t be needing much adjusting, might I remind you.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes with that response. She’s afraid there’s no winning with this one, but that doesn’t mean she can’t try. “I’ll survive eating Kraft mac &amp; cheese. You can literally just leave me here to rot.”</p><p>“Bold of you to assume I’ll allow you to do that.” Lilia smiles, waving a dismissing hand. “Again, 6:30. Reservations are tough. We can’t miss it by being late.”</p><p>Agatha has never liked being told what to do. In truth, she never had the chance to develop a sense of what <em>she</em> wanted. Growing up, choices weren’t things she was allowed to make—they were things handed to her, already decided, already final. Her mother spoke, and Agatha followed. That was the rhythm of her childhood, obedience disguised as normalcy.</p><p>Her favorite color is purple, yet she could never wear it or own anything in that shade because her mother disliked it. She was pulled out of school at least twice a month to accompany her mother on out-of-town trips to visit friends—Agatha left waiting in the car with nothing but a bag of nuts. And when she begged to study pre-law in college, her mother refused without a second thought.</p><p>That’s just what it was for Agatha.</p><p>The moment she gained the liberty to speak for herself, Agatha made a vow: no one would ever dictate her life again. Anyone who tried would quickly learn just how difficult she could be when pushed.</p><p>Lilia is an exception to that rule. With her, Agatha’s defenses soften. She finds herself agreeing without hesitation, following requests without the usual bite or prickly resistance. It’s effortless in a way that should feel unsettling, but doesn’t.</p><p>Maybe it’s because Agatha’s entire career spiraled into motion after she appeared as a background extra in one of Lilia’s films all those years ago. Maybe because they have stayed close and kept in touch since then. Maybe because Lilia had no prejudices when Agatha was a nobody.</p><p><em>Or</em> maybe it’s because Lilia offered Agatha kindness and gentleness she had never truly known.</p><p>Neither would ever dare say it aloud, but the truth lingers between them all the same. Lilia has become the mother Agatha never had, and Agatha the daughter Lilia never expected.</p><p>Two lives intertwined not by blood or obligation, but by choice.</p><p>A few hours passed and Agatha still shows up at 6:30 despite resenting the idea of being out and about in Westview. She warns Lilia that she can’t promise to be on her best behavior tonight, especially once drinks are served.</p><p>The town bore little resemblance to what she once knew. Buildings had shifted, old businesses had vanished, and new ones had materialized. Even the pavement she used to follow home had been replaced and rebuilt.</p><p>Still, Westview’s wrapped around her exactly as she remembered. Cold, sharp, and unsettingly familiar. Almost <em>too</em> familiar.</p><p>Agatha, Lilia, and Kate—Lilia’s ever-naive assistant, found themselves being led into <em>Rayo del Sol,</em> a restaurant dressed in soft terracotta walls and sun-washed golden accents. Sun emblems hung here and there, glowing like tiny halos.</p><p>Their table was tucked as far from the main crowd as possible, a courtesy extended whenever known people like them needed to eat in peace. It wasn’t actually a thing for celebrities but Kate managed to argue and prove her point when she made the reservation a couple of months ago. Meaning, she cried and pleaded her way to give utmost satisfaction to her boss’ dining experience. Or in this case, <em>bosses.</em></p><p>Agatha gives the place one slow look and snorts. “Subtlety is clearly not the owner’s strong suit.”</p><p>“You think?” Kate asks, occupying the chair adjacent to her. “Fun fact: this place is one of Westview’s pride and joys! Their Puerto Rican menu is supposedly Michelin-star quality.”</p><p>Agatha lifts a brow, unimpressed. “Key word, supposedly.”</p><p>“I like it.” Lilia adds. “It’s.. home-y.”</p><p>“You like a lot of things. Frankly, your standards aren’t high to begin with.”</p><p>“And it’s that supposed to be a bad thing?”</p><p>“It is when your entire plan is to create an army of future Academy awardees with speeches that require at least a mention of your name.” Agatha points an accusing finger at her mentor. “If you want to avoid social media discourse or flop cinema weekends, you must recognize and sort through actual talents. Sydney Sweeney wannabees are definitely <em>not</em> one of those.”</p><p>Before Lilia can take offense at Agatha’s remark, a young girl approaches their table holding a handful of menus. The initial thing Agatha noticed is that the said girl isn't in uniform, unlike the other servers who greeted them earlier.</p><p>She’s dressed casually in a beige turtleneck, red pants, and worn-in Doc Martens. Agatha gives her a slow once-over, curiosity flickering in her eyes.</p><p>She doesn’t usually bother paying attention to.. well, normal people. But something about this girl tugs at her, draws her focus in a way she can’t put a name to.</p><p><em>Odd.</em></p><p>“Good evening!” She greets, her blue eyes landing on Agatha a second too long. It’s as if she recognizes her, which isn’t unheard of considering Agatha’s status. “Here are your menus. Please don’t hesitate to take your time and browse them one by one.”</p><p>Lilia and Kate graciously take theirs. Agatha does not.</p><p>She is suspicious of the girl, and she doesn’t even know why.</p><p>“Do you work here?”</p><p>The girl quickly responds, “I do.”</p><p>“Really?" Agatha attempts to press more. “Because everyone else is in uniform, and you’re not.” She even makes the show of gesturing to a staff serving a nearby table to prove her point.</p><p>“Well.. I was called in last-minute. Didn’t have time to change.” The girl doesn’t flinch despite Agatha’s attempt of intimidation.</p><p>“And how old are you? Twelve?”</p><p>“I just turned sixteen, actually.”</p><p>Agatha clicks her tongue. She’s not even trying to hide the disdain in her face as she continues to speak, “Still unprofessional. This place is supposed to be—Kate, what was it?”</p><p>“Uh.. Michelin star?”</p><p>"Right. Michelin star.”</p><p>“I’m sorry if you find <em>my</em> being unprofessional, Ms. Harkness.” The girl doesn’t break her posture. “Would you prefer a different server then?”</p><p>“Darling, that won’t be necessary.” Lilia finally butts in, giving Agatha a warning glare. “You’re fin–”</p><p>“No, she’s not fine.” Agatha cuts her off. “She’s out of uniform and menus can be easily stolen. For all we know, she’s a deranged fan who bribed someone to sneak in so that she can interact freely with celebrities.”</p><p>Truth is, no one can blame Agatha for being cautious. Sure, she’s rude to this young girl and maybe all her assumptions are incorrect but she can never be too careful. Especially one of her status. She has her fair share of crazy experiences with so-called fans, and those always ends up with someone overstepping a boundary she didn’t give them permission to cross.</p><p>The girl lets out a tiny laugh. “Deranged fan.. <em>huh</em>. That’s new.”</p><p>“Agatha.” Lilia hisses. “Please don’t make a scene. She’s just a child.”</p><p>“She’s a teen.” Agatha shoots back. “And excuse me for caring about our safety. Stalkers come in all shapes and sizes, they don’t exactly show up labeled.”</p><p>The girl’s expression shifts. If Agatha wasn’t intently looking at her, she would have missed it. Just for a second—hurt flashed in the girls expressive eyes, like she’d been bracing for those exact words to come since the moment she showed up tonight.</p><p>Again, <em>odd.</em></p><p>“It’s not my intention to.. possibly ruin what should be a lovely night for all of you.” The girl says, her voice gentle but steady. She pointedly avoids looking at Agatha this time, turning instead to Lilia and Kate with an apologetic smile. “If you’ll excuse me, I’ll go fetch another server for your table. Have a good night ahead.”</p><p>She leaves without so much as a final glance at Agatha.</p><p>Once she’s out of earshot, Lilia exhales sharply and immediately begins to lecture Agatha about manners, decency, and respecting people who are literally offering you service. She said that Agatha’s scrutiny was unwarranted and she could’ve seriously frightened that poor girl.</p><p>Agatha ignores all of it, flipping open the menu with feigned disinterest as her free hand lift automatically to her silver pendant, pressing it between her thumb and forefinger. It is an action done out of habit.. or possibly, comfort.</p><p>The interaction had been brief, even dismissive. And yet.. The more she remembers the image of that girls’ piercing ocean eyes, something twinges deep in her chest—a feeling she refuses to acknowledge.</p><p>Despite the earlier tension brought by Agatha’s outburst, the rest of the night unfolded calmly. Work schedules were sorted, conversation flowed, and the much to Agatha’s surprise, the food was exceptional.</p><p>Who needs that damn <em>Michelin star</em> anyway?</p><p>The bistec encebollado, in particular, nearly brought her to tears. It was so good she briefly wondered what kind of drugs or preservatives they might’ve slipped to make it taste divine. But when she asked a server, they claimed everything was organic and “farm fresh.” Agatha was too enamored with the dish to call their bluff.</p><p>“May I personally give compliments to the Chef?” Agatha asks, all in good spirit.</p><p>“We’d love to arrange that,” The server says, “But unfortunately, <em>Chef Vidal</em> had to leave early for the night. We’ll make sure to pass your compliments along.”</p><p>Vidal.</p><p>Agatha knows that name, although she can’t remember why.</p><p>Or how.</p><p>“Well, make sure to send them my kisses too.” Agatha declares, waving her hand in a theatrical arc. “That steak was spectacular, I can practically see myself eating it forever.”</p><p>In the next few minutes, Agatha indulges in a rarity as someone who enjoys the spotlight the same way she ravishes her privacy. She allows herself be swarmed by eager staff and guests alike, letting them take selfies and receive autographs, mostly written in napkins.</p><p>She’s absolutely convinced they slipped something mystical into her dish for her to be <em>this</em> welcoming and approachable to a group of people.</p><p>In reality, it’s just the wine talking. A couple of glasses would do that to a person.</p><p>When it was finally time to leave, Agatha slipped away to the restroom to freshen up. She needs a moment alone before stepping into whatever chaos waited beyond the restaurant doors. With the buzz she’d gotten, she was sure paparazzi would be waiting outside. Her presence is apparently the hottest topic Westview had seen in years.</p><p>She reapplies her lipstick, watching her silhouette with practiced precision. The restroom is quiet, blissfully so—until the click of footsteps breaks the silence.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look up at first. But when she catches the newcomer’s reflection in the mirror, her hand stills.</p><p>It’s the young girl from earlier. The one who unsettled her for reasons she refuses to name. Or, <em>can’t</em> name.</p><p>Of course. Just her luck.</p><p>Their gazes collide in the mirror—blue against blue, both unwilling to be the first to look away. The girl hesitates at the threshold, breath hitching subtly before lunging herself forward, coming to stand at the sink beside Agatha.</p><p><em>Bold kid,</em> Agatha thinks. She’ll give her that.</p><p>From the corner of her eye, Agatha secretly observes as the girl turns on the faucet, letting the cold water pool into her hands. She’s still wearing the same clothes as earlier. No uniform. No apron. No attempt to blend in with the other staff.</p><p>Figures.</p><p>Even with the staff’s confirmation that the young girl indeed works there, Agatha’s suspicion hasn’t eased. Why wasn’t this girl in uniform like the others? Is it some rule about minors working part-time? Or is there something else going on that no one’s admitting?</p><p><em>“Dawn.”</em></p><p>Agatha freezes mid-motion, lipstick hovering near her mouth. “Excuse me?”</p><p>The girl lifts her gaze, meeting Agatha’s eyes through the mirror once again. “Dawn. It was the first film I ever saw you in.” She pauses, then adds, “Well, the first out of three. Your body of work isn’ really.. for children.”</p><p>Agatha is rendered speechless. A rare, almost alarming state.</p><p>There’s that unsettling feeling in her chest again. She doesn’t like it.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t get unsettled, most especially not by a random sixteen year old who doesn’t follow basic institutional policies.</p><p>The girl continues, mistaking Agatha’s silence for permission.</p><p>“I remember thinking how brave your character was. Fighting crimes, injustices, standing alone in a world against her with no support whatsoever.” She smiles, but it’s crooked. <em>Sad.</em> “You were strong. The kind of strong little girls cling to. You were the personification of dawn that appears first after darkness, giving way to the sun before it sets.”</p><p>“Above all, I admired how you loved.” Her voice softens. “How you held on to the people you cared about and never.. never..”</p><p>Her voice cracks.</p><p>Agatha seizes the opening. “Would you like an autograph, dear?” She interrupts, tone dripping condescension. “You don’t have to monologue. You can just ask.”</p><p>The girl lets out a laugh humorless laugh, and then, <em>“Why do you hate me?”</em></p><p>Agatha blinks, taken aback. “What?”</p><p>“Why do you hate me?”</p><p>“I—I don’t hate you.”</p><p>“Then why do you treat me like this?”</p><p>Agatha has no answer to that question. She can be awful, sure. But she’s never this awful to some kid she just met. The way she’s reacted to this girl all night.. it’s defensive. </p><p>It’s almost like she's mustering up the courage to build walls and use it to surround herself as a barrier for an emotion she refuses to feel.</p><p>She wants to defend herself. ‘I’m not like that.’ ‘I’m never like this.’ ‘You’re making something out of nothing.’</p><p>But none of it comes out, because she knows it isn’t nothing.</p><p>They <em>both</em> do.</p><p>This girl has been unsettling her since the moment she appeared with those menus. Something familiar, almost wrong, and most importantly something important she’s resisting to understand.</p><p>“I.. I..” Agatha’s voice is barely audible as she attempts to find the right words to say.</p><p><em>“Rays of the Sun.”</em> The girl murmurs instead, averting her gaze from Agatha as she speak. “Rayo del Sol means rays of the sun.”</p><p>She moves to grab a napkin and used it to dry her hands. Then, she smooths her shirt, gives Agatha a small, heartbreaking smile, and turns toward the door. That should be the end of it.</p><p>Unfortunately, it isn’t.</p><p>She stops and looks back. This time, her face seems a little brighter, carrying a sense of newly found confidence.</p><p>“Oh, and one more thing.” Her tone shifts almost instantly. “I loved Dawn, but let's be real—you were a <em>terrible</em> crier.”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth falls open.</p><p>“Like, really terrible. Your tears weren’t even and your sobs sounded awful. I didn't know if you were acting or having a stroke. It was honestly painful to watch.”</p><p><em>This little shit.</em></p><p>“And don’t get me started on your early commercials.” Rae adds, warming up. “The shampoo one? Your hair wasn’t even that shiny to begin with, who were you fooling back then?”</p><p>At this point, Agatha’s jaw is practically on the floor.</p><p>Rae just shrugs, deadpan. “Honestly, you didn’t improve until, like.. I don’t know, a decade and two later? Again, I don’t really follow your Hollywood journey. You never piqued my attention.”</p><p>“How dare you?” Agatha sputters in disbelief.</p><p>“I’ve always wondered how you won that Emmy.. Was it a pity prize?” She blinks at<br/>Agatha with feigned innocence as if she did not just verbally eviscerated the older woman before her.</p><p>Agatha is so stunned she actually forgets how to speak. Her brain simply flatlines</p><p>Rae finally steps toward the door, hand on the handle. Her eyes are gleaming with mischief and.. something softer beneath it.</p><p>“Anyway..” She continues breezily without missing a beat, “I’m <em>Rae.”</em></p><p>Agatha snaps and grabs the opportunity by clearing her throat, desperate to redeem herself. “Right. Rae.” She lets the name roll on her tongue. “Is it short for.. 'Rae-who-should-really-watch-her-mouth-around-adults,' <em>that</em> Rae?”</p><p>“No.” Rae smirks. “It’s short for.. 'Rae-the-daughter-you-gave-up-for-adoption-sixteen years-ago,' <em>that</em> Rae.”</p><p>She opens the door.</p><p>Agatha stops breathing.</p><p>Rae slips out.</p><p>The door shuts.</p><p>Agatha’s knees nearly buckle. Her fingers were the first to surrender as her lipstick clatters into the sink, falling freely from her grip.</p><p>Her brain becomes a singular, echoing word that continues to yell all across her lobes.</p><p>Rae is.. her <em>WHAT?!</em></p>

<p>Agatha was 24 when she had Rae—no. </p><p>Agatha was 24 when she had a <em>daughter.</em></p><p>Well, she was actually a day away from turning 25 when she gave birth to Rae—again, <em>not</em> Rae. </p><p>She was a day away from turning 25 when she gave birth to her daughter.</p><p><em>Daughter</em>.</p><p>Agatha <em>had</em> a daughter.</p><p>Agatha <em>has </em>a daughter.</p><p>The word daughter has always tasted foreign in her mouth. She never dared saying it aloud after convincing herself it was something she was not meant to claim, something she lost the right to the moment she fled Westview.</p><p>It is something that is <em>not </em>hers.</p><p>Leaving her mother, leaving the life she knew, letting go of the version of herself she was raised to be—that was easy.</p><p>Leaving a part of herself, her <em>own </em>child, wasn’t.</p><p>Agatha learned that sometimes, the right choice is the most difficult to make.</p><p>The pregnancy was an accident, but the love she felt wasn’t. She yearned to keep the child. She <em>wanted</em> to keep the child. But all that couldn’t erase the fact that she wasn’t ready in all aspects. Mentally, financially, emotionally.</p><p>Two things can be true at once: she loved the child with everything she had, yet she knew she couldn’t give her the life she deserved.</p><p>Above all, she couldn’t risk her child’s safety—not with the threats her own mother hissed into her ears every chance she got.</p><p>So, if letting go meant giving her child a chance at a life far better than the one she could offer, even if that life didn’t include her, then <em>so be it.</em></p><p>Agatha barely remembered leaving the restaurant. Kate had to physically guide her out of the comfort room, muttering her name in gentle whispers as an attempt of comfort. Her sudden shift of demeanor didn’t go unnoticed by Lilia, who carefully asked if she was alright. Agatha dismissed her concern with the effortless, practiced confidence she’d perfected over the years.</p><p>Once they arrived home, Agatha quietly slipped into her room, carrying the air of someone who desperately did not want to be disturbed. She didn’t bother turning on the lights or changing into more comfortable clothes. She simply sank onto her bed, back pressed against the headboard, her pendant curled tightly in her palm it might as well just leave a mark.</p><p>She remained steady and still as the hours crawled past her, replaying the encounter with Rae in a relentless loop. Her eyes are void of tears, which is a cruel contradiction considering she had just met her daughter—or someone <em>claiming </em>to be her daughter.</p><p>She let the hollow quiet of the night swallow her whole, drifting in and out of sleep, until the first rays of dawn made itself known through the uncovered windows.</p><p>After a few minutes of contemplation, Agatha finally forced herself out of bed. She stumbled toward her suitcase, grabbed a matching Lululemon set, and headed straight for the bathroom. She splashed cold water on her face, went through the quickest version of her hygiene routine, and tied her long hair into a tight ponytail.</p><p>If she couldn’t quiet her thoughts, she figured maybe she could <em>at least </em>outrun them.</p><p>For the time being.</p><p>The house was quiet when she left, and so were the streets of Westview. Life was still for now, most people deep in sleep. Agatha preferred it this way. At least then no one would recognize her or disturb the peace she was once again trying to rebuild.</p><p>She kept running with no exact destination in mind. Even with all the growing changes in Westview, Agatha still prided herself on knowing the place, where alleys to turn, which blocks to avoid.</p><p>She’d been running for so long, lost in thought, that she didn’t realize her feet had carried her back to Rayo del Sol. How she managed to find her way here again, she didn’t know. Maybe out of instinct. Maybe out of something she refuses to name.</p><p>She stood outside, taking in the vast exterior of the restaurant. Its golden accents caught the early light, as if the whole place was waking up gently with the sun.</p><p>If Rae works here.. if Rae has to work at such a young age, does that mean she isn’t living a good life? Does that mean she’s struggling financially?</p><p>Or.. Agatha forced the thought, maybe Rae just wants extra income like many kids her age.</p><p>Agatha jumps in surprise when the doors suddenly swung open, revealing a woman dressed in athletic clothes—almost similar to Agatha’s. She wore a simple green bralette and black shorts, her skin glowing faintly with sweat as if she’d just finished a workout.</p><p>The woman stopped dead in her tracks. Her brown eyes widened the moment it locked against Agatha’s blues, shock flickered across her features as if she had seen a ghost.</p><p>The said woman had straight dark brows, deep-set eyes, and a mouth that seemed to be one second away from a smirk. Her long hair is braided neatly to one side, though a few strands had slipped free, carried lightly by the passing breeze.</p><p>Agatha swallowed the lump in her throat. <em>Fantastic</em>. Of all people she could run into looking like a sleep-deprived mess—why does it have to be <em>this </em>woman? If the circumstances were any different, Agatha would’ve absolutely made a move to flirt.</p><p>Well, that is—<em>if</em> she ever confirmed this woman was into women. Or single. Preferably both.</p><p>“Uh..” The woman tried to speak, but only an incoherent sound escaped her mouth.</p><p>“I was just passing by.” Agatha waves a hand, pretending at a cool she absolutely did not possess right now. “I’m Agatha, by the way.”</p><p>“I know who you are.” The woman quickly replies without hesitation. Too fast, too certain. She then held Agatha’s gaze for a moment too long, lips parting, then closing again—like she wanted to speak but couldn’t shape the right words.</p><p><em>Odd.</em></p><p>Agatha figured she might as well put the poor woman out of her misery, and walk directly into her own mess while she was at it.</p><p>“Hey, do you..” Agatha's voice falters, unsure how to keep the conversation going without giving away too much—without sounding like a complete creep asking about Rae. “Do you perhaps.. work here?” Her fingers automatically reached for her pendant, searching for something to hold onto, something to do when her nerves spiked.</p><p>The woman nods. “Sort of.” She winces at her own answer, as if it wasn’t the one she meant to give. “I’m <em>Rio</em>. I actually own the place.”</p><p>Agatha stared for a beat—just long enough for the realization to settle over her.</p><p>Rio, the owner.</p><p>Rio, the chef.</p><p>Rio, the hands behind that incredible dish last night, the one <em>so </em>divine Agatha would’ve kissed her as thanks only if she had been there to receive it.</p><p>“Rio Vidal.” Agatha remembers names the same way she remembers lines and cues—<em>perfectly</em>. “Pleasure to meet you.” She steps forward and extends a friendly hand.</p><p>Rio hesitates for a moment, yet she finds herself accepting the gesture anyway. “The pleasure is mine.” Their hands brush a moment too long before Agatha pulls away, offering her a small smile.</p><p>“I was born and raised here, you know.” Agatha says. For a moment, she forgets why she’s here as she allows herself to slip into casual conversation. “I always heard the Vidal name growing up. Shame we were never in the same part of town.”</p><p>The Vidals were known for being a prominent family with businesses spanning from culinary ventures to banks and investments. Agatha instantly knows Rio is some kind of quiet big-shot, probably with a hefty trust fund tucked under her name.</p><p>“Well..” Rio replies shyly, as if her wealth is something she’d rather pretend doesn’t exist. “You made quite a buzz last night. Reservations came flooding in when people found out the great Agatha Harkness deemed my restaurant worthy of her presence.”</p><p>“Oh, please.” Agatha waves her off again, dramatically this time. “I heard reservations are already difficult to begin with. You didn’t need me to boost your name.”</p><p>“I didn’t know you were <em>this</em> humble.”</p><p>“Well, I can tell you more about me if you ask me out.” Agatha, of course, has no shame. She will flirt at dawn, at dusk, and in the middle of a mental breakdown. Consistency is key, as she likes to say.</p><p>Rio blinks, surprised and amused. “Yeah?” She challenges, finally finding her footing. “And how exactly would you know I swing on the same team?”</p><p>“I don’t. I just open my mouth and hope for the best.” Agatha shrugs lightly. “Besides, it’s never too late to embrace who you truly are, or whatever motivational nonsense people put on mugs.”</p><p>Rio chuckles out loud and Agatha has to physically restrain herself from collapsing upon seeing her gap tooth in full view. “Agatha Harkness..” Rio says with a shake of her head, “We just met and you already amaze me.”</p><p>“I’m certain I can amaze you even more if we were to meet again.” Agatha winks at her to prove a point. “I’ll be in Westview for a while. Now’s the perfect opportunity to ask <em>me</em> out.”</p><p>“And what if I had a partner?”</p><p>“You wouldn’t have humored me this long if you did.” </p><p>Rio studies her like she’s actually weighing the offer. “Then why don’t you ask <em>me</em> out?” She challenges. “Since you’re so bold.”</p><p>“Oh, I’d personally skip the date and drag you straight to my bed.” Agatha replies without flinching. “You look like the type who’d insist on dinner first before letting me in <em>your</em> bed, and since my new year's resolution is to become modest, I believe now is the perfect start..”</p><p>Rio pokes her cheek with her tongue, arms folding. “And what makes you think I wouldn’t go for that?”</p><p>Agatha grins. “Because I knew you’d like the anticipation. The build-up. The tension.”</p><p>She knew she’d hit the jackpot when Rio turns silent for a short while, her expression darkens into something <em>more</em> promising.</p><p>“Private dinner tonight. Cabeza.” Rio decides. “Will you text me your address so I can pick you up?”</p><p>“My, what a gentleman. Chivalry isn’t dead after all!” Agatha gaps theatrically, hands to her forehead to elevate the show she has put on. “You may reach me through social media, you know where to find me.”</p><p>“Amongst a thousand other people?”</p><p>“My phone number is sacred. I don’t give it out easily.”</p><p>“You were just proposing a sleepover like.. Two minutes ago.”</p><p>Agatha adjusts the hem of her shirt and smiles meaningfully, “What can I say? I’m a woman of multitudes.”</p><p>Her eyes suddenly drifted to the Rayo del Sol sign, and the reason she’d come here in the first place slammed back into her. <em>Rae</em>. For a moment, she’d forgotten. And she silently thanked Rio for giving her that brief escape.</p><p>Rio watched her expectantly, as if waiting for Agatha to say something other than another flirtatious line, but she didn’t. Instead, Agatha offered a quick goodbye and told Rio to message her elsewhere.</p><p>She must’ve been imagining things, but.. she could’ve sworn Rio looked a little disappointed. Agatha wasn’t sure why.</p><p>During her run back home, Agatha decided she’d deal with Rae another time. Her main priority as of now is to confirm whether Rae was actually her child before deciding how to move forward. That part was tricky since no one had known about her pregnancy, but she was certain her bitch (affectionately) of an assistant, Jenny Kale, could help her figure it out.</p><p>She sent Jen a brief, urgent message the moment she arrived home. Then she took a long bath to officially start her day. By the time she stepped out, both Lilia and Kate were already awake and to her benefit, neither seemed eager to revisit her behavior from the night before.</p><p>They followed the day’s schedule as Lilia’s acting workshop kicked off. The drive to the studio took them to the busier part of town, where morning chaos was already in full swing.</p><p>Agatha sank into her seat beside Lilia for the dreaded screening process. Not everyone could join the workshop—Lilia insisted on watching each child perform first, with Agatha sitting in like some reluctant judge on a very low-budget talent show. Agatha thought the whole thing was tacky and painfully unnecessary.. though she begrudgingly acknowledged that it <em>somehow</em> worked.</p><p>Kid after kid performed. Some spent their entire stage time squealing at Agatha, which she considered deeply unprofessional. Lilia, of course, defended them by saying they were just starstruck. A handful were so young they couldn’t even pronounce half the words in their monologues. Others were visibly bored, clearly abducted by their overenthusiastic mothers for a chance at 'character building.'</p><p>Fifty (<em>not really) </em>kids later, Agatha finally received the notification she’d been waiting for. Not that she would ever admit she was waiting for it.</p><p>It was from a user <em>riovidal</em> on Instagram.</p><p><strong>riovidal: </strong>found you</p><p><strong>riovidal</strong>: technically, it wasn’t much of a challenge</p><p>Agatha fought back a smile as she accepted the request, quickly typing in Lilia’s address and hitting send before she could think twice about it.</p><p><strong>agathaharkness</strong>: I have zero tolerance for unpunctuality.</p><p><strong>riovidal</strong>: noted, my lady :p</p><p>She puts her phone down at the sound of footsteps, the next hopeful being guided into the room. Her smile vanished as quickly as it had appeared the moment she recognized who it was.</p><p><em>Rae</em>.</p><p>Gone were the sweater and Doc Martens.</p><p>This time, she wore a simple white dress, her long hair loose and tucked behind her ears. She looked almost angelic—if Agatha didn’t know better.</p><p>This was the same kid who verbally gutted her last night and dropped a life-altering revelation in the same breath. How could Agatha ever forget her?</p><p>“Hi!” Rae greets, waving politely mostly at Lilia. “My name’s Rae.”</p><p>“Absolutely not.” Agatha cuts in instantly.</p><p>“Agatha!” Lilia scolds, smacking her arm lighlty. “What is wrong with you?”</p><p>“Nothing! I just don’t think she’s.. actress material.” Agatha insists, already gripping her pendant like a stress ball.</p><p>Rae, hearing everything, tilts her head. “Oh..” She says sweetly. Or was it in a mocking tone? “Is that what they told you when Hollywood kept rejecting you a hundred times before you finally got lucky?” <em>Definitely</em> mocking.</p><p>Agatha didn’t even look at her. She simply lifted a middle finger in Rae’s direction while keeping her focus on Lilia. “I’m your co-actor slash judge slash whatever. You have to trust my judgment.”</p><p>“Agatha Harkness, put that finger down!” Lilia hissed, swatting her hand. “If you can give me one valid reason, then maybe I’ll listen.”</p><p>Because she <em>might be</em> my daughter.</p><p>“Because she’s a menace.”</p><p>“I’m literally right here.”</p><p>“Weren’t you taught not to interrupt when adults are speaking?” Agatha snaps, throwing a sharp glance at Rae’s way. “It’s called basic decency and respect, you should look it up."</p><p>“Respect begets respect.” Rae fires back, glaring right back at her. “And for your information, <em>my</em> mami taught me everything I needed to know.”</p><p>A Mami. She has a mami—and the way she said it almost sounded defensive. <em>Protective</em>. It hits Agatha harder than it should but she brushes the feeling off immediately.</p><p>Good. At least Rae has a parental figure in her life. At least she’s <em>not</em> alone.</p><p>Wait. Why does that matter to Agatha?</p><p>“Don’t mind her, sweetheart.” Lilia says kindly. “Go ahead with your lines, and Agatha will now shut up and act like a respectable adult with basic decency—” She cuts Agatha a pointed glare, “—and respect.” Agatha can only grunt before sinking back into her seat, resigned to see what Rae has to offer.</p><p>Rae beams at the older woman, then discreetly raises a middle finger, hidden from Lilia’s view and angled perfectly so only Agatha can see it. This <em>little</em> shit.</p><p>“Whenever you’re ready.” Lilia encourages her. “Although, I think you might’ve left your script outside. You should grab it first.”</p><p>“It’s okay. I won’t be needing it.” Rae says confidently. “I memorized my lines while waiting for my turn.”</p><p>What a show-off.</p><p>Lilia snickers and leans sideways to whisper to Agatha, “That’s <em>exactly</em> what you said when you auditioned for my film back then.” She giggles. “This kid is just like you.”</p><p>And while Lilia means nothing by it, Agatha shifts uncomfortably in her seat.</p><p><em>Just like her.</em></p><p>She held her pendant tightly and remained quiet as Rae prepared to perform l</p><p>Rae steps into the middle, her white dress glowing under the bright studio lights. From where she stands, she looks almost untouchable as if the universe wrapped her in god-lighting just to spite Agatha.</p><p>She inhales, squares her shoulders, and begins.</p><p>At first, her voice is gentle. <em>“Isn’t it splendid to think of all the things there are to find out about?”</em></p><p>Agatha shifts in her chair once more, arms crossed, blatantly unimpressed.. or trying to be.</p><p>Rae continues, her eyes not on Lilia, but drifting purposefully to Agatha.</p><p><em>“It just makes me feel glad to be alive—it's such an interesting world.”</em></p><p>She says it like she means it. Like she’s talking about something bigger than the line. Bigger than the workshop. Like she’s talking about the life she’s been living <em>without</em> Agatha.</p><p>Rae continued her monologue, slipping into more Anne of Green Gables lines with an ease that made Agatha’s jaw clench. The kid easily shifted from whimsy to earnestness to heartbreak as if she had an emotional switch built into her.</p><p>By the time Rae finished, Lilia was openly crying—tears streaming, hands clasped to her chest like she had just witnessed the birth of a prodigy.</p><p>Agatha knew instantly: <em>She lost</em>.</p><p>There was no fighting this.</p><p>Rae was getting into the workshop whether Agatha liked it or not. And worse.. she was, by far, the most promising kid they’d seen all morning.</p><p>Agatha swallowed the truth like a bitter pill.</p><p>As much as it pained her, as much as she wished the universe would cut her open instead, she had to give credit where it was due.</p><p>Rae was good. <em>Exceptionally</em> good.</p><p>So good it almost felt unfaif, like cheating.</p><p>Like the talent wasn’t learned but rather.. <em>inherited</em>.</p><p>It was inherited from someone who was also terrifyingly good.</p><p>Someone who could command a room with nothing but a monologue and a stupid amount of dramatic flair.</p><p>Someone named <em>Agatha Harkness.</em></p><p>Agatha’s entire body stiffened.</p><p><em>No</em>. Absolutely not. She's not going there.</p><p>Not right now.</p><p>Not in front of her emotional mentor and this smug kid. Possibly, <em>her</em> smug kid.</p><p>She isn't going there, not if she could help it.</p><p>Lilia asked Rae to stay for a bit while she excused herself for a bathroom break. Agatha immediately tried to protest loudly, but Lilia shut her down with one firm look and vanished out the door.</p><p>So now it was just the two of them. Agatha <em>and</em> the kid who may or may not be her biological nightmare.</p><p>They share the painfully silent four-cornered room, pretending very hard not to look at each other.</p><p>Agatha hadn’t said a single word about Rae’s performance.</p><p>No compliments nor insults. Not even a sarcastic <em>“huh.”</em></p><p>Instead, she glued her eyes to her phone, rereading her message thread with Rio for the seventh time just to divert her attention. The only thing stopping her from flinging herself out a window was the promise of tonight’s private dinner.</p><p>Two <em>agonizing</em> minutes passed until Rae cleared her throat deliberately, forcing Agatha to look up.</p><p>Agatha met her gaze with the weariness of someone who did not sign up for any of this.</p><p>“What do you think?” Rae asks. She tried to play it cool, even though deep inside she desperately longed for Agatha’s approval.</p><p>Agatha, of course, feigned complete nonchalance. “You were.. <em>adequate</em>.”</p><p>“Woah!” Rae gasps dramatically. “Careful, you might run out of compliments!”</p><p>“I’m rationing them,” Agatha says dryly.</p><p>“I know you think I’m good, you just won’t admit it.” Cocky little gremlin.</p><p>Again—just like Agatha.</p><p>“You think highly of yourself, don’t you?”</p><p>“Why not, if I can walk the talk?” Rae shrugs, then smiled as if a mischievous idea sparked in her head.</p><p>Agatha recognized that smile instantly, as if she was looking at her own reflection.. only years younger..</p><p>Hell, she <em>invented</em> that smile.</p><p>It was her signature <em>'I’m-about-to-be-a-problem-and-you-can't-stop-me'</em> smile.</p><p>Rae steps forward so Agatha can see her more clearly. She innocently bats her eyelashes and says in the sweetest voice Agatha has ever heard, “I can’t wait to spend the next few weeks working with you, <em>Mommy!”</em></p><p>Oh, for fuck’s sake.</p>

<p>The day went on with more kids coming in and out for auditions. In the end, the workshop accepted more or less thirty children, and Lilia simply would <em>not</em> shut up about Rae. The next big thing, a natural, a star in the making—you get the gist as she goes on and on about the kid she just met.</p><p>Agatha pretends to hate it, but there was a quiet, inconvenient pride curling in her chest. If Rae is indeed her daughter, then there was no denying how her genes had done spectacularly well. The kid not only resembled Agatha in a way that’s difficult to ignore, she’d clearly inherited her talent as well.</p><p>If this were a different situation, trust that Agatha would brag about it endlessly.</p><p><em>Like mother, like daughter.</em></p><p>Once everything was packed up and Agatha steps outside for a breath of fresh air, the universe naturally decided to be funny and make her suffer even more. She runs straight into Rae.</p><p>Of course she did.</p><p>Why was the kid still hanging around, anyway?</p><p>“If you’re planning some dramatic bit to get more attention from Lilia, save it.” Agatha says flatly. “I’m running on fumes.”</p><p>Rae raises a brow and crosses her arms. “I believe she already adores me. I’m not desperate to try that hard.”</p><p>“Then why haven’t you left?”</p><p>“Uber’s on the way.”</p><p>“You don’t own a car?”</p><p>“I just turned sixteen.” Rae shrugs. “I failed my driver’s test. My mom won’t let me retake it yet unless I sit through another safe-driving class for beginners.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her, equal parts relieved and annoyed. Good. No accidents involved, just pure teenage incompetence.</p><p>“Your mom..” Agatha murmurs, attempting to inquire more.</p><p>There are so many things she wants to ask about Rae’s life, about the woman who raised her, about everything she missed.</p><p>But the words refuse to come, so she doesn’t.</p><p>Not yet.</p><p>Instead, she settles for, “Why isn’t your mom picking you up? And why aren’t you with an adult today?”</p><p>“Why do you care?” Rae snaps, and before Agatha can respond, she speaks again, “She’s working and I’m almost an adult myself, I don’t need daytime supervision."</p><p>Agatha exhales. “What does she do?” To make it clear if it isn’t, she clarifies, “Your mom.”</p><p>“She’s a chef.” Rae replies. “I’m heading to see her, actually. She told me she’s going out to dinner tonight, and she asked me to help her pick what to wear.”</p><p>That alone said a lot. Rae must be really close with her mom.</p><p>“So.. you two are close.” Agatha concludes.</p><p>“We are. It’s always just been the two of us, anyway.” Rae replies.</p><p>Agatha plays it cool as she digs in for more, with whatever information she can possibly get. “No other parent?”</p><p>“No.” Rae looks at her straight in the eye. “I prefer it that way, tho.”</p><p>“What way?”</p><p>“To <em>only</em> have my mami. I don’t need anyone else.”</p><p>Agatha felt it straight through her ribs.</p><p>Instinctively, she reaches for her pendant, gripping it like an anchor to ground herself. “How long have you known?”</p><p>“Known what?” Rae frowns.</p><p>That you’re <em>mine</em>. Biologically. That you’re <em>my</em> daughter.</p><p>“That I’m the one who—”</p><p>“Gave me up?” Rae cuts in. “For adoption?”</p><p>Agatha exhales. “Yeah.”</p><p>“I asked.” Rae says quietly. “During my birthday earlier this month.”</p><p>She says it like Agatha doesn’t know her own child’s birthday. As if Agatha hadn’t counted the days once, hadn’t memorized a birthday she never got to celebrate.</p><p>“My mami had the file all this time.” Rae explains. “Your name and everything there is to know about the adoption. She never looked at it. She didn’t want to know anything about you then.”</p><p>Rae’s voice doesn’t waver. “She said that part of my life wasn’t hers to touch. That I should be the one to decide, should I want to know.”</p><p>Her gaze stays on Agatha. “So we opened it. Recently. That’s how we knew it was you.”</p><p>Agatha is conflicted. Part of her remains skeptical of Rae—of the timing, the circumstances, the unanswered questions. She needs certainty. She needs proof. She tells herself she can’t accept this until she’s absolutely sure.</p><p>And yet, despite her resistance, her heart betrays her.</p><p>There’s an ache. Almost a familiarity she never asked for.</p><p>She denies it, pushes it down.. but it’s there all the same beyond logic and reason.</p><p>She knows.</p><p><em>She knows.</em></p><p>Who else knows?</p><p>Her chest tightens as the implications crash in. The wheels in her head begin to spin, fast and unforgiving. It isn’t just her career that flashes before her eyes. The contracts, the scrutiny, the inevitable backlash—she’ll survive. She can handle the kind of life that she chose.</p><p>But Rae?</p><p>The public turns curiosity into condemnation, being too comfortable with snooping into celebrities’ lives. They would tear Rae apart just as easily. They would dig into her childhood, her adoption, <em>her mami, </em>searching for something scandalous to consume.</p><p>They wouldn’t see a kid. They’d see a headline.</p><p>“Who else knows?” She asks, keeping her voice even.</p><p>Rae blinks. “What?”</p><p>“That I’m your biological mother.” Agatha says. “Who else knows?”</p><p>Because if this gets out, it won’t just be her life that gets torn apart.</p><p>This little shit doesn’t deserve that.</p><p>Rae stares at her, those blue eyes wide and accusing, mirroring something in Agatha herself. And then she chuckles. Really chuckles. “You’re unbelievable.”</p><p>“Excuse me?” Agatha asks, her tone clipped.</p><p>“You only care about your career, don’t you?” Rae presses, defensive now. “You don’t want anyone to find out because it could ruin you.”</p><p>Of course she cares about her career. It’s her liberation, her life built brick by brick, each role and achievement carved out of sheer determination.</p><p>But beyond that, there’s Rae. Even though she only met Rae yesterday, she already cares about the kid. She cares enough that the thought of the world hurting her, or dragging her into scandal, makes Agatha’s chest tighten. She cares because Rae <em>might</em> be her daughter, because the possibility alone makes herself yearn for the child she lost in ways she didn’t expect.</p><p>Although she’ll never admit it out loud. That she cares. Not now, maybe not ever.</p><p>Her chest tightens, guilt and fear twisting together. If the world knew, the press, the public, her fans.. the scrutiny would be relentless. Headlines, rumors, questions about her morality, her choices, her past. And Rae, the menace that she is but innocent all the same, would be dragged into it. Agatha can’t let that happen.</p><p>“I—” Agatha starts, then stops. Words fail her once more.</p><p>Rae lets out a huff, disappointment and hurt almost evident in her expression. “Don’t worry. No one else knows other than me and mami.”</p><p>She brushes past Agatha, bumping into her shoulder forcefully, making Agatha stumble. She lets it pass. She deserved that anyway.</p><p>“No one will ever know.” Rae adds, her voice quieter now as she turns toward the exit.</p><p>Before she disappears completely, she glances back for the last time. “Besides, it’s not like I’m exactly proud to be <em>Agatha Harkness’ daughter.”</em></p><p>She tries to hide the sting of emotion behind a tight smile, but Agatha notices. A flicker of something. Vulnerability slips through. Agatha recognizes it instantly because she has the same. It mirrors her own emotions, her own carefully hidden fears.</p><p>In that instant, she sees herself in Rae.</p><p>She doesn’t know what to do with that fact.</p><blockquote><p><b>agathaharkness:</b> Can I call a raincheck?<br/><b>agathaharkness:</b> I suddenly feel under the weather.</p></blockquote><p>A few seconds pass.</p><blockquote><p><b>riovidal:</b> oh no<br/><b>riovidal:</b> you didn’t look me up and find all the secrets my family owns, did you?<br/><b>riovidal:</b> coz that can be a real turn off</p></blockquote><p>Agatha smiles despite herself. <em>Secrets</em>. Figures. Everyone has something they keep tucked away.</p><blockquote><p><b>agathaharkness:</b> If I had, I’d be canceling with a press release.<br/><b>agathaharkness:</b> This is more of a personal implosion kind of evening.<br/><b>agathaharkness:</b> It’s been a long day. It’s one of those where kids say things they probably shouldn’t, and adults take it harder than they admit.</p><p><strong>agathaharkness: </strong>I'm not used to dealing with kids, obviously.</p></blockquote><p>There’s a pause on the other end.</p><blockquote><p><b>riovidal:</b> kids have a talent for that<br/><b>riovidal:</b> mine does it without even trying</p></blockquote><p>Agatha’s fingers still hover over the screen. <em>Mine.</em></p><p>She swallows.</p><blockquote><p><b>agathaharkness:</b> You have a kid?</p><p><b>riovidal:</b> teenager<br/><b>riovidal:</b> brilliant, exhausting, thinks she knows everything<br/><b>riovidal:</b> which, to be fair, she occasionally does</p><p>Agatha exhales a quiet, humorless breath. Of course.</p><p><b>agathaharkness:</b> Then you understand why I might not be in the mood for crowds tonight.</p><p><b>riovidal:</b> i certainly do<br/><b>riovidal:</b> do you want soup? i make very convincing soup<br/><b>riovidal:</b> no expectations, no small talk<br/><b>riovidal:</b> it's something warm and delicious</p></blockquote><p>Agatha stares at the message longer than necessary.</p><blockquote><p><b>agathaharkness: </b>Soup would be acceptable.<br/><b>agathaharkness:</b> However, I make no promises about being charming.</p><p><b>riovidal:</b> you’re good</p></blockquote><p>Agatha sends the address before she can talk herself out of it.</p><p>The moment it’s done, she scowls at her phone like it personally betrayed her. Great. Fantastic. Inviting near-strangers over now. This is how horror movies start.</p><p>She locks the screen and sinks back into the couch at Lilia’s house, rubbing her thumb against the edge of her pendant.</p><p>She barely knows Rio. A few conversations, a lot of flirting, and a postponed dinner that somehow turned into soup delivery. It’s ridiculous, really. This is only going to be their second meeting—barely even that, if she’s being honest and yet Rio has already slipped past Agatha’s usual defenses with alarming ease. She doesn’t feel the need to bolt. No alarms going off. No urge to disappear.</p><p>That’s new. And suspicious.</p><p>Agatha Harkness does <em>not</em> do comfort without cost.</p><p><em>Get a grip,</em> she tells herself. <em>You like pretty women. You’ve always liked pretty women. </em>This is nothing new, nothing mystical, nothing worth spiraling over. Rio is attractive—effortlessly so, which is frankly annoying. She carries herself with that quiet confidence Agatha has always been weak for. The kind that doesn’t need to announce itself. The kind that makes you lean in without realizing you’ve moved.</p><p>That’s all this is.</p><p><em>Probably.</em></p><p>Agatha exhales through her nose once again. She doesn’t like people who make things feel easy. Easy usually comes with strings.</p><p>She tells herself it’s just appreciation. Curiosity. Maybe boredom. Maybe the universe throwing a distraction at her when she desperately needs one.</p><p><em>It’s just soup.</em> She convinces herself. <em>It doesn’t mean anything.</em></p><p>Rio arrives twenty minutes later.</p><p>Agatha knows it without checking the clock because the house feels different before the knock even comes.</p><p>Agatha opens the door to the smell of garlic and ginger.</p><p>Rio doesn’t step inside. She stays just beyond the threshold, like she’s been very deliberately trained not to cross invisible lines without permission. She’s holding a paper bag in one hand and a soup container tucked under her arm, hair slightly damp as if she’d rushed straight from the kitchen. She looks.. domestic.</p><p>That should <em>not</em> be doing things to Agatha. </p><p>“I brought soup.” Rio says, lifting the bag like evidence. “And bread. I didn’t know what kind you liked, so I went with neutral and inoffensive.”</p><p>Agatha huffs. “Bold strategy.”</p><p>Rio flashes a toothy grin, the one that looks like trouble and pokes her cheek with her tongue. “I’m excellent at being inoffensive when necessary.”</p><p>“Tragic.” Agatha deadpans. “You hide it well.”</p><p>They stand there for a beat, neither rushing the moment. Agatha notices the way Rio’s eyes flick past her shoulder, respectful and curious but not nosy. Still not stepping in.</p><p>“You don’t have to hover.” Agatha says. “I’m not contagious.”</p><p>Rio laughs, soft and brief. “I figured tonight was more of a soup drop-off than a dinner-and-flirting extravaganza.”</p><p>Agatha snorts despite herself. “Raincheck.” she says. “Dinner another time. When I’m less, well.. whatever this is.”</p><p>“Understood.” Rio says easily. No pressure. No disappointment—well, maybe a trace of it, hidden behind another grin. “I’ll hold you to that.”</p><p>She hands over the bag, their fingers brushing for half a second longer than necessary. Rio doesn’t pull away first. Neither does Agatha.</p><p>“Feel better.” Rio adds. “And,” She taps the container lightly, “Eat. That’s an order.”</p><p>Agatha raises a brow. “You're ordering me around already?”</p><p>“Orders from the chef.” Rio replies, tongue poking her cheek again, a habit Agatha is already filing under <em>annoyingly endearing</em>. “I’m very professional.”</p><p>Agatha watches her walk away before she closes the door, which is absolutely not something she plans on unpacking tonight.</p><p>Later, curled up with the soup balanced in her hands, Agatha takes one spoonful and pauses.</p><p>It’s good. Comfortingly so. </p><p>She scowls at it, then at her phone, and finally types:</p><blockquote><p><b>agathaharkness: </b>Soup’s unfairly good.<br/><b>agathaharkness: </b>Thanks.</p></blockquote><p>A reply comes almost instantly.</p><blockquote><p><b>riovidal: </b>told you.<br/><b>riovidal: </b>feel better</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> i shall see you around</p></blockquote><p>For the first time that day, Agatha's heart and mind felt at ease. A small smile sneaks in despite her best efforts as she takes another bite.</p><p>Little does she know, in one of Westview’s bigger estates, Rae notices that same smile and asks where it's from or why it's there. Rio deflects the question easily but later, alone, she wonders what it means to keep seeing Agatha without telling her daughter.</p><p>It goes the same for Rae who is silent about the restaurant and the workshop, basically about having already crossed paths with her biological mother.</p><p>For once, they are both holding things back, each unaware of just how close their truths already are.</p><p>The name <em>Agatha Harkness</em> lingers unspoken.</p>

<p>“Your reinforcement has arrived.”</p><p>Agatha startles awake when the lights in her room flip on, her body still heavy with sleep. The mattress dips immediately after as someone jumps straight onto her bed with zero regard for personal space. </p><p>She squints and attempts to adjust her vision. Eventually, Jen comes into view. Her alarm hasn’t gone off and her room is still dark beyond the curtains. The unwelcome guest is clearly wide awake and painfully chirpy at this hour, far too pleased with herself for having interrupted Agatha’s carefully orchestrated beauty sleep.</p><p>Agatha groans, covering her eyes with the back of her palm. “Get the fuck out of here and come back after 8:00 am <em>or</em> I will hex you and your entire bloodline. You’ll never know peace and your descendants will feel it in their bones.”</p><p>Jen laughs, completely unthreatened. “Wow. That’s a lot of energy for someone who called me and demanded I take an urgent flight to Westview.” She reminds. “You’re being dramatic.”</p><p>“Not right now.” Agatha deadpans. “I am being reasonable.”</p><p>Jen flops more comfortably onto the bed, settling beside Agatha. “I brought you five just in case.. Or, I don’t know. Just to be sure, I guess?"</p><p>“Five what?”</p><p>“Pregnancy tests. <em>Duh.</em>” Jen says, like it’s the most obvious thing in the world. “I figured you couldn’t buy them here on your own, so—ow! What is wrong with <em>you</em>?” She hisses as Agatha bolts upright, her feet slamming straight into Jen’s thighs.</p><p>“What is wrong with <em>you</em>?” Agatha parrots, genuinely offended and visibly shuddering at the implication. “Why would you think I’m pregnant?”</p><p>“Why else would you ask me to come here ASAP?”</p><p>“I can think of a million other things, Jennifer. Jesus Christ.” If she were a devoted Catholic, she would’ve made the sign of the cross right then and there. “I am <em>not</em> pregnant.”</p><p>Jen’s expression softens as she reaches out for Agatha’s arms. “I know it won’t be easy, especially at your age and being an established woman whose career—”</p><p>“Shut the fuck up!” Agatha whispers screams, concerned that the walls might be thin enough to disturb other people in the household. All traces of sleep have removed itself from her body at this point due to the conversation they’re having. “I am not pregnant. Don’t make me repeat that a third time because I am this close to losing my mind.”</p><p>“Say sike right now.”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Never mind.” Jen waves a dismissive hand, realizing her friend slash boss isn’t exactly fluent in whatever trendy terms kids use these days. “If you’re not..” She stops herself from saying the word <em>pregnant</em> when she notices the vein in Agatha’s forehead threatening to burst. “Okay. Then why am I here? Why was I summoned?”</p><p>Agatha met Jen five years into her career. Hollywood was ruthless, and Agatha had just won her first Emmy, only to discover that her previous assistant had been sneaking off with her personal wardrobe (RIP to that one vintage Chanel bag she actually adored).</p><p>At first, Jen and Agatha weren’t exactly compatible. Both had strong personalities, and Agatha didn’t want an assistant she argues with constantly. But Lilia, who always seemed to know what was best for Agatha, suggested otherwise. Agatha listened despite herself and gave it a shot.</p><p>Jen proved herself worthy when a particularly aggressive paparazzi captured a moment out of context, Agatha was laughing politely while standing near a known corrupt politician. She knew how showbiz works that within hours, gossip columns would spin it into a full-blown scandal: <em>Agatha Harkness dating a man under investigation.</em></p><p>Jen showed initiative, acting fast without being told. She shielded Agatha from the camera, guided her through a back exit, and quietly explained how they’d handle the rumors. Agatha would never associate herself with the man, let alone date one, but thanks to Jen’s careful and meticulous actions, they dodged a potential scandal entirely.</p><p>That particular moment sealed their partnership. Jen handles all the logistics, movies, schedules, and contracts. She’s Agatha’s manager, agent, and assistant all rolled into one.</p><p>And while they bicker endlessly, their friendship is unbreakable, tho neither of them would admit it out loud.</p><p>“Why am I here, Agatha?” Jen repeats, much gentler this time when Agatha failed to reply on her first try.</p><p>Agatha sighs. How could she even begin to explain what she’d been up to the past two days? Well, clearly, the past few years, if Jen was going to know the entire context.</p><p>Her fingers find the pendant again, rolling it between her thumb and forefinger. “There’s a kid..” She starts slowly. “A teenager.”</p><p>Jen waits. She’s learned not to interrupt when Agatha talks like this.</p><p>“She showed up on our first night here.” Agatha continues. “And now she won’t leave my head. Or my life, apparently.”</p><p>Jen’s brows knit together. “Okay..” She says cautiously. “And?”</p><p>Agatha lets it hang, waiting for Jen to realize what she’s been implying without having to spell it out. “And she looks like me. Talks like me. Acts like me.. She’s basically just like me, but younger.”</p><p>Jen blinks once. Twice. A third time.</p><p>“..Agatha.” She mutters her name carefully, “What exactly are you not telling me?”</p><p>Agatha stares at her friend as she adjusts her position, hugging her knees closer to her chest. “What I’m about to say is what I’ve done. You can judge me all you want, but whatever I did, I did with reason and what I thought was best at the time.”</p><p>Jen nods. “I’d judge the way you like your oatmeal, but never the decisions you made back then.” She says with a small smile, encouraging Agatha to continue. “Trust me.”</p><p>For the first time, Agatha told Jen what happened, or at least enough of it to make sense. She’d gotten pregnant at twenty-four, a one-night thing with a woman at a bar. She was still living under her mother’s roof with nothing to her name. Giving the baby up felt like the safest choice for she hadn’t known anything else then. And now, sixteen years later, the child.. <em>Rae</em>—shows up.</p><p>Agatha tells her about their first interaction at the restaurant, about the way Rae looked at her like she already knew. She doesn’t miss the way Jen visibly winces when she mentions that Rae is also part of Lilia’s workshop.</p><p>She’s really here and she’s real.</p><p>Jen was quiet the entire time, just listening and letting out an occasional <em>“hmm”</em> here and there.</p><p>Once Agatha finished, Jen finally spoke. “So.. you have a kid.”</p><p>Agatha’s breath hitched at the admission she’d been trying to deny. “I have a kid.”</p><p>“And she’s just like you?”</p><p>“Painfully so..”</p><p>“Damn.” Jen offers a chuckle to somehow ease the tension in the room. “As if the world needed more variants of Agatha Harkness, may God help us all.”</p><p>They sit quietly for a while, both lost in their own thoughts, until Jen finally asks the question Agatha has been waiting for. “Are you one hundred percent sure she’s yours?”</p><p>“<em>No.</em>” Agatha admits. The word comes out rougher than she expects. “But I know I’m also <em>not</em> wrong with the thought that she’s possibly mine, and that’s the problem.”</p><p>Jen studies her for a moment, eyes sharp in the way that means she’s already thinking three steps ahead. “No one else knows, besides her and the adoptive mom, correct?”</p><p>“That’s what I’ve been told.”</p><p>Jen nods slowly. “Then you still have control. That matters.”</p><p>With that, her expression fully shifts. The softness doesn’t disappear, but it hardens into something purposeful. “Okay.” She says, already standing and slipping into manager mode. “We must verify.”</p><p>Agatha tries to protest,“Jen—”</p><p>“No.” Jen cuts in gently but firmly. “This isn’t about doubt, this is about certainty.”</p><p>She starts pacing, ticking things off on her fingers. “First: we do nothing publicly. No statements and no leaks. This strictly stays between us.”</p><p>Agatha nods.</p><p>“Second,” Jen continues, “We confirm the adoption records. Quietly, I must emphasize. I know a couple of lawyers who specialize in sealed and semi-open adoptions. One owes me a favor, the other dumped me on my birthday. Either way, we get access without making noise and that’s a priority.”</p><p>Agatha tries to discredit the one where her friend got dump on her birthday, noting that it should be a topic for another time. “Would that even be possible after sixteen years?”</p><p>“I don’t speak legal, but I assume everything is possible with a huge chunk of money.” Jen says easily. “Your name is already on the paperwork, anyway. That should be doable.”</p><p>She stops pacing and looks straight at Agatha. “Third, if and only if you want to, we can do a private DNA test. Not with the ones in clinics to avoid electronic database. There are doctors who handle this discreetly for public figures. I’ve dealt with one before, it’s surprisingly easy."</p><p>Agatha blinks but doesn’t question. Seems like Jen has an entire lifetime to herself before she met Agatha.</p><p>“And lastly,” Jen’s voice softens. “We protect the kid. You already have contact—fine. You’re simply her mentor. You keep it professional, appropriate, and exactly within the lines you already have. No emotional promises. No confessions you can’t take back. Again, we have to confirm first and give you plenty of time to decide what role, if any, you’re ready to play in that kid’s life.”</p><p>It’s too much to process, even for someone as brave and sharp-tongued as Agatha. Jen notices the shift in her demeanor and decides not to push. Instead, she settles back on the bed beside her friend and lets the silence do the work, offering comfort without a single word.</p><p>“Agatha?” She murmurs after a few minutes. “Be honest with me, do you want that kid to be yours?”</p><p>Agatha doesn't answer right away. It requires a lot of thought, and..</p><p>“I don’t know.” She whispers. “There’s maybe and possibly, and I already think of her as is. It’s.. complicated. I really don’t know.”</p><p>“That’s okay.” Jen accepts her answer without the need of pushing for more. “I’ll start making calls today and deal with what I can.”</p><p>A weight she hadn’t realized she was carrying lifts off her shoulders. “Thank you.”</p><p>Jen smirks. “Please don’t thank me yet. Wait until I invoice you for this, your bank account won’t take it lightly.”</p><p>A beat, then Jen bumps her elbow against Agatha’s playfully. “Bitch, I really thought you were pregnant.” She laughs. “Who would’ve thought you’d already given birth?”</p><p>“Seriously, Jenny?” Agatha glares at her, the emotions finally starting to feel lighter. “Again, why the fuck would you think that?”</p><p>“Don’t be offended, but for the run of my entire career working with you, I always assumed the biggest scandal I’d have to deal with was you accidentally getting yourself pregnant.”</p><p>That earns her a more sharper glare.</p><p>“I have always been prepared, I have plans ranging from A-Z.” Jen continues unapologetically. “And you can’t exactly blame me. I’ve got a pretty wide list of contacts from women you’ve engaged yourself with over the years.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t take offense. She knows it’s mostly true.</p><p>Though, to be fair, not as bad as Jen makes it sound.</p><p>“I got really scared when a few months ago, you told me you were off birth control.” Jen adds. “We were in the middle of filming the Hill film, and you were fooling around with that Russian lady—which, by the way, was the hottest of them all, if you ask me.”</p><p>Agatha prides herself on that. Melina was hot, and it was fun while it lasted.</p><p>Little did Jen know, nothing ever happened between her and Agatha beyond a few steamy make-out sessions.</p><p>Agatha is exclusive, chooses carefully who she <em>actually</em> sleeps with and practices safe sex religiously, driven by a lingering fear of getting pregnant again. Birth control stayed part of the routine, even when there was no real action.</p><p>“I’ve obviously learned my lesson about sex right before I joined showbiz, hon.” Agatha says dryly. “Also, I’m in my early menopausal stage so you can <em>definitely</em> breathe now. You won’t be needing your alphabet plan.”</p><p>Jen scoffs. “Whatever. The pregnancy tests I bought were pretty damn expensive, those were the best brands.” She says bitterly. “You’re paying me back.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. “Worth it for your peace of mind.”</p><blockquote><p><strong>agathaharkness:</strong> I happened to be near the area..</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> 51? geez<br/><strong>riovidal:</strong> i wasn’t informed about your sidequests</p><p><strong>agathaharkness:</strong> Haha. Very funny.<br/><strong>agathaharkness:</strong> I brought back the soup containers from last night.</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> you really didn’t have to</p><p><strong>agathaharkness:</strong> What, because you have a hundred more?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>riovidal:</strong> nope<br/><strong>riovidal:</strong> more like a thousand                                                                           <br/><strong>riovidal:</strong> that sounded extremely nerdy                                                                                                           <strong>riovidal:</strong> i am absolutely NOT keeping count of my food containers</p><p><strong>agathaharkness:</strong> Sure you aren’t.</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> i’m being rude aren’t i                                                                                                                       <strong>riovidal:</strong> just to be sure<br/><strong>riovidal:</strong> when you said around the area<br/><strong>riovidal:</strong> rayo del sol.. right?</p><p><strong>agathaharkness:</strong> Depends.<br/><strong>agathaharkness:</strong> How many restaurants do you actually have?</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> that one i keep count of, but it’s irrelevant information<br/><strong>riovidal:</strong> give me a sec</p></blockquote><p>Agatha steps out of the rented car, the hazard lights ticking behind her impatiently. She shuts the door with more force than necessary and looks up just in time to see Rio push through the restaurant’s side entrance.</p><p>Breathless. Slightly flushed. And, annoyingly.. conveniently, dressed in a crisp white chef’s uniform.</p><p>Of course she is.</p><p>Her sleeves are rolled up just enough to show a fraction of her forearm. Agatha stares without shame and takes it all in. She observes the way the white catches the afternoon light, the way Rio wears that toothy grin even from a far, the way that the other woman looks entirely in her element.</p><p><em>Well.</em> That’s unfair.</p><p>Rio spots her in no time as she jogs the last few steps over. “Hi,”</p><p>“Hi.” Agatha pretends to act cool. “You look like the place was on fire.”</p><p>“Soufflé emergency involving a couple of new sous chefs.” Rio replies, then she points at the hazard lights blinking behind Agatha. “I think your car is screaming for help.”</p><p>Agatha waves a dismissive hand. “It’ll live.”</p><p>Rio chuckles, then pauses, suddenly aware of her appearance. She tries to smoothen the fabric of her uniform consciously, “Sorry, I didn’t have time to change.”</p><p>“Don’t.” Agatha says without thinking.</p><p>“Don’t?”</p><p>“Apologize,” Agatha clarify, though her eyes linger anyway. “You look—” She stops herself before she says anything crossing the lines of initial flirting, so she settles with, “<em>Appropriate</em>.”</p><p>Rio’s grins again, wider this time. She pokes her tongue briefly into her cheek, like she’s holding something back. “That’s the nicest compliment I’ve gotten all day.”</p><p>“Don’t flatter yourself.”</p><p>“Should I not?”</p><p>They stand there for a beat, traffic humming past and the restaurant buzzing just behind Rio. Agatha becomes acutely aware of how close they are. How easy it would be to step closer, if she wanted to..</p><p>“You really should..” Rio points out, gesturing at the car again, breaking the thin ice. “Do something about that.”</p><p>“I wasn’t planning on staying.” Agatha replies. She lifts the plastic bag in her hand. “I told you I was around the area. And I happened to bring the container with me.”</p><p>That was a <em>lie</em>. Cue the acting when you naturally need them.</p><p>She hadn’t been anywhere near the area, and if there was one thing Agatha Harkness did <em>not</em> do, it was doing mundane errands such as returning food containers. She’s not equipped with that kind of morals and to develop it all of a sudden is highly unlikely.</p><p>It’s not even as if Rio is in desperate need of those containers. The woman clearly owns an obscene number of them, probably stashed in some massive kitchen warehouse somewhere in Westview.</p><p>She’s here on purpose.</p><p>To see Rio.</p><p>But as flirtatious as she can be, Agatha would rather choke than say that out loud.</p><p>She’d do a lot of other things rather than saying them aloud these days, unfortunately.</p><p>“I can whip something up.” Rio offers, shy but hopeful. “If you want.. and, um, if you don’t have other plans, maybe you could come in and—”</p><p>Agatha lets her pause hang. She’s curious to see her try, see her earn her attention a little because that’s just how Agatha is. She loves a little fun.</p><p>“And what exactly would you whip up for me?”</p><p>“You’re literally standing in a restaurant, Agatha. The options are endless.”</p><p>“And if I wanted, hmm.. some duck with caramel glaze? Can you make that happen?"</p><p>Rio quirks a brow, amused. “Not exactly on our usual menu, but yes, I can make it happen if that's what you <em>really</em> want.”</p><p>Agatha smirks, leaning back just slightly. “Then consider me a guest.”</p><p>Agatha stepped into the kitchen, letting herself be guided past the clatter of pots and pans. She recognized a few chefs and staff from previous visit, bracing herself for the worst in case she runs into Rae. She prays to whatever Gods will listen that she doesn’t.</p><p>Rio moved like she owned the place. Well, she does own the place.</p><p>Apron on, hair tucked back, knives in hand, chopping onions and stirring sauces with that quiet confidence Agatha didn’t even know she enjoyed watching. </p><p>Their conversation flowed naturally. When was the restaurant established, how many award shows Agatha had survived slightly intoxicated.</p><p>All the while, Agatha kept stealing glances at Rio, realizing she was.. Completely charmed. </p><p>More than charmed, if she was being honest to herself. She had never felt this kind of pull toward a woman. It was curious and flirtatious. It was easy and surprisingly pleasant.</p><p>She finds herself wanting for <em>more</em>.</p><p>She wanted to see where this could go.</p><p>Rayo del Sol doesn’t accept guests until six, which leaves the place quiet in a way Agatha isn’t used to. It feels like the space has been paused just for them. </p><p>Rio leads Agatha toward the far end, where the lights are dimmer and softer. It was almost like an accidental dinner setup that was never meant to be romantic but kind of is anyway.</p><p>She’d traded the chef’s uniform for a sleeveless turtleneck and neutral trousers in no time. Agatha scowled at the loss, but stared anyway. Rio made even the simplest outfit look effortless.</p><p>And <em>hot</em>. Definitely hot, as simple as it is.</p><p>Is Agatha <em>that</em> desperate?</p><p>In her defense she hasn’t been with a woman in months so, yes. Maybe she is.</p><p>Rio sets down the dishes she made herself, the result of Agatha watching the entire time. She offered sarcastic commentary as Rio ignores most of it, hums through the rest. Agatha stays amused anyway.</p><p>No duck, in the end. Agatha had scrunched her nose at the idea, decided mid-thought that the word <em>duck</em> felt wrong in her mouth and promptly wanted nothing to do with it. Rio laughed and let it go without teasing her too much.</p><p>They eat slowly, talking between bites. The food container delivery agenda has turned into a dinner Agatha promised, and she's nowhere near complaining.</p><p>“Where did you go to high school?”</p><p>“Westview High.” Rio says, settling into the chair across from Agatha. “I had quite a reputation as a troublemaker.”</p><p>“Did you saran-wrap toilets or set someone’s hair on fire?”</p><p>“Neither, surprisingly.” Rio laughs. “But I did get caught making out with girls, one of them being the principal’s daughter.”</p><p>That gets Agatha’s attention. She lifts a brow. “So you weren’t a goody-two-shoes.”</p><p>“Far from it.” Rio says easily. “What about you? Where’d you go?”</p><p>Agatha takes a slow sip of the red wine Rio opened earlier. It was something she claimed was from the eighties. “St. Catherine’s.”</p><p>Rio waits for the punchline. When it doesn’t come, she blinks. “You’re kidding.”</p><p>Agatha Harkness <em>and</em> catholic school sounds completely on the opposite ends of a wavelength. </p><p>“I don’t kid about trauma.” Agatha says flatly. “I think they used to pray for me more than they prayed for their own families.”</p><p>More conversation flows easily between them. Agatha asks Rio how many women she’s dated; Rio, unsurprisingly, turns the question right back on her.</p><p>Neither of them answers. Both numbers stay deliberately vague, tucked away behind smirks and raised brows, like a shared agreement not to ruin the mystery.</p><p>By the time they reach the end of the meal and with dessert somehow making its way to the table, Agatha realizes that she’s genuinely enjoying Rio’s company.</p><p>The ease of it. The quiet attention. The way Rio listens without prying.</p><p>She likes it more than she probably should.</p><p>And yet, no matter how comfortable the moment becomes, one thought refuses to leave her alone.</p><p>Or, one name.</p><p><em>Rae.</em></p><p>From what she’s observed, Rio seems distinctly close with the staff, which means it’s safe to assume she knows Rae. And as thankful as Agatha is that she hasn’t crossed paths with the kid today, that little menace still refuses to leave her mind.</p><p>She has questions. A few of them. And maybe, just maybe.. Rio can answer some.</p><p>“There’s a kid working here.” Agatha begins carefully. “And, uh.. I’m just—well. I’d really like to know anything about her..” She trails off, unable to find the right wording without sounding like a creep.</p><p>“My staff?” Rio asks, interest piqued. “I hope they didn’t trouble you, or sell your autograph on eBay for a thousand dollars or something.”</p><p>Agatha wishes it were that easy. “No.” She shrugs. “Her name’s Rae, actually. Do you—”</p><p>Rio’s expression shifts at the name. Her mouth parts, something unreadable flickering across her face before she clears her throat. Her posture stiffens, suddenly rigid, almost restless. “You met Rae?”</p><p>“I did. My first night here.” Agatha answers, not yet clocking the change in Rio’s behavior. “She’s a breath of fresh air, isn’t she?”</p><p>Rio stills completely.</p><p>“Agatha.” She says carefully, “What exactly has Rae told you?”</p><p>Agatha assumes Rae must have a reputation here. Mouthy, sharp, tends to cross one's boundaries. That would explain Rio's reaction, so she doesn’t dwell on it. “She didn’t do anything bad, if that’s what you’re thinking.” Agatha clarifies, attempting a chuckle that sounds brittle even to her own ears. </p><p>Rio closes her eyes for a second. Just briefly. She needed to ground herself or perhaps, make the world stop spinning.</p><p>When she looks at Agatha again, something has shifted—something guarded and unreadable. “We really need to talk about Rae.”</p><p>Before Agatha can ask why, Rio’s phone vibrates sharply against the table. She ignores it, until she glances down. Agatha catches a brief glimpse of the caller ID. Sun emojis and a letter. Nothing useful to decipher.</p><p>Not that she wanted to. That would be eavesdropping, in a way.</p><p>Rio exhales a frustrated breath and stands abruptly, muttering a soft, “Excuse me.”</p><p>She steps away, voice lowered as she answers, leaving Agatha alone with her wine and the creeping sense that she’s just stepped into something far bigger than she meant to.</p><p>Rio said they needed to talk about Rae.</p><p>What was there to talk about that involved Agatha?</p><p>Her mind immediately runs through the worst possibilities, because of course it does.</p><p>Is Rae in trouble? Is she sick? Have she done something illegal?</p><p>What could possibly be wrong enough to warrant this kind of reaction?</p><p>“Dios mío.” Agatha overhears Rio mutter, loud enough that it cuts through the low hum of the restaurant.</p><p>Rio’s back is to her now, phone pressed to her ear, hands lifting to her forehead like she’s trying to physically contain whatever headache this conversation is giving her. She paces a few steps, agitation written into every movement.</p><p>“<em>Raina.</em>” Rio snaps into the phone, voice tight. “What exactly have you done?”</p><p>Whoever Rio was talking to on the phone, Agatha knew damn well it wasn’t her business to pry. She already had enough on her plate to begin with.</p><p>“You can’t just.. No, listen to me—” Rio’s voice cracked slightly this time, a sharp edge beneath the usual calm. “I’ll be heading home quick.”</p><p>Agatha tried to hide the disappointment flaring across her face. Rio had to leave making their early night was cut short. Not that she was expecting anything more, but maybe she had hoped for just a <em>little</em>.</p><p>“Until then..” Rio said, her eyes briefly meeting Agatha’s as she turned around, “Please don’t do anything stupid.” With that, she dropped the phone.</p><p>Agatha took her cue, standing as well to meet Rio at eye level. “Everything okay at home?”</p><p>“It should be.. there’s just a slight problem.” Rio admitted. “Listen, I have to leave now.”</p><p>“I get it.” Agatha forced a small smile. “Sounds important.”</p><p>“It is.” Rio confirmed.</p><p>They stand there, face to face, neither knowing what to do, neither wanting to cross a line.</p><p>Rio, polite as ever, leans forward slightly and gives Agatha a brief, almost awkward hug. Their bodies barely touch.</p><p>“I had fun tonight.” Rio says, soft but sure. “And I promise, we’ll talk about Rae next time.” Agatha nods, holding onto that promise.</p><p>Somehow, just knowing the conversation can wait eases the tightness in her chest. “I’m the one who owes you now.” Rio then murmurs, voice low.</p><p>Rio gestures for her to head out first, but Agatha shakes her head, claiming she needs to use the bathroom anyway. With a final wave, Rio smiles and makes her exit.</p><p>Agatha sighs once she’s gone.</p><p>The closest thing they got to physical contact tonight was a hug.</p><p><em>Agatha Harkness.. got a hug.</em></p><p>A hug.</p><p>Damn it. Does Rio have to be such a gentleman now that she’s older? Agatha would pay to see her being feral.</p><p>Fuck those lucky girls who got to make out with Rio during high-school, Agatha thinks. And maybe fuck her for wanting it too.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Rae was five years old when she learned the word <em>adoption</em>.</p><p>She was in kindergarten then, a time where she’d throw a fit if she’s asked to wear anything but princess dresses. She had chubby and rosy cheeks, and you’ll never see her without a big bow attached to her pigtails or a sparkly tiara on top of her braids.</p><p>School was her first real window into a world beyond her family tree. </p><p>Her friends constantly talked about parents the way kids do, casually and without weight: two moms, two dads, a mom and a dad.</p><p>With that came along small observations. How many hands her friends held. How many voices called their names during pickup.</p><p>Rae watched and noticed.</p><p>While most of her friends had two parents, Rae had one.</p><p>She only had mami.</p><p>Mami is gentle, and kind, and patient.</p><p>She always tells Rae that she is smart and beautiful. She tells Rae that she’s the best thing that had ever happened to her. </p><p>Mami gives her presents even when it isn’t her birthday or Christmas. She kisses her scraped knees, read her bedtime stories, and holds her hand a little longer than most whenever Rae needed it.</p><p>That had always been enough for Rae.</p><p>But the world had a way of teaching children to compare, and then to question. </p><p>As Rae grew and stepped further outside the safety of what she knew, she began to notice that what she had was different.</p><p>Not wrong.</p><p>Not lacking.</p><p>Just <em>different</em>.</p><p>So when Rae finally asked mami about it, she can vividly remember the way mami’s breath hitched.</p><p>Mami didn’t answer right away. Instead, she led Rae into the kitchen and sat her on one of the tall stools by the island. She took Rae’s hands in hers before she spoke, holding them close together.</p><p>That day, mami told Rae she was adopted.</p><p>Rae didn’t know what that word meant yet. It might even be the first time she has heard of it at all.</p><p>To make her understand more, mami explained that Rae hadn’t come from her belly. She hadn’t been pregnant, she hadn’t given birth.</p><p>Rae frowned at that, the lines in her forehead becoming more visible by the second. At school, she’d learned that babies came from mommies’ bellies. That was how it always worked. Everyone said so.</p><p>So, if she <em>didn’t</em> come from mami’s belly.. where did she come from?</p><p>Mami squeezed her hands a little tighter, like she already knew the question Rae had in mind.</p><p>Mami told Rae that she had always wanted a child, even if it meant raising one alone. </p><p>She didn’t have a partner, and she was unable to carry a baby herself.</p><p>She wanted to have a child to shower with affection, to raise, and to come home to every single day.</p><p>So when she was twenty-seven, she went to an orphanage in Westview. Mami told Rae that the moment she saw her, she <em>knew</em>. </p><p>Not because four months old Rae cried the loudest or smiled the brightest, to the extent of her newborn capabilities. </p><p>It’s because something in mami’s heart simply said, <em>there you are.</em></p><p>And that was how Rae came to her.</p><p>That was how Rae came to be.</p><p>On top of that, mami also told Rae that she has another mom. </p><p>The other mom was the one who carried her in her belly and brought her into the world.</p><p>Rae was able to comprehend the implications.</p><p>If she had another mom, then why was she here?</p><p>Why did she have to be.. adopted?</p><p>Why was she given away?</p><p>Mami chose every word carefully, not wanting to plant a negative narrative in Rae’s mind about her biological parent.</p><p>She said that sometimes, grown-ups know they can’t give their child the life they deserve. And when that happens, the bravest thing they can do is ask someone else to love and care for that child instead.</p><p>With that, Rae began crying, and mami’s heart broke the way it always did when she sees her little girl in tears.</p><p>Rae didn’t fully grasp what it meant to be given away. It sounded awful, sure—but it didn’t hurt the way mami seemed to think it would.</p><p>What hurt was the idea that there was someone else out there.</p><p><em>Another mom.</em></p><p>The fact felt heavy in her chest. She thought of it as unfamiliar and wrong.</p><p>Rae didn’t want another mom.</p><p>She only wanted mami.</p><p>The fear was strong enough that she said it out loud.</p><p><em>“What if she comes</em> back?” Rae quivered. <em>“What if she takes me away from you?”</em></p><p>Mami’s face softened immediately. She promised that it would <em>never</em> happen. No one would take Rae away from her. Not now, not ever.</p><p>And if anyone ever tried, mami would fight them the same way she fights nightmares and monsters under Rae’s bed at night.</p><p>They sealed it with a pinky swear.</p><p>Later, when Rae finally stopped crying, mami asked if being adopted made her feel sad. Or strange. Maybe different?</p><p>Rae shook her head.</p><p>She said she felt lucky because someone had chosen her on purpose.</p><p>At five, Rae accepted that easily.</p><p>At fifteen, it refused to be ignored.</p><p>The questions didn’t disappear, they simply learned how to wait.</p><p>She still believed she was chosen, that was never the question.</p><p>But she had started to wonder <em>who</em> had let her go.</p><p>Rio admitted that she doesn’t actually know who Rae’s other mom is, but she has the file that keeps her records and information safely secured. </p><p>She wants Rae to make the decision when she’s older and vowed to give her full support once she makes the choice for herself.</p><p>On her sixteenth birthday, Rae finally opened the file with Rio by her side.</p><p>The folder was neat and thin, but the contents felt heavy in their hands. Every detail was there including dates, medical records, and adoption papers. Everything was kept safe all these years, just as Rio promised.</p><p>And then came the printed name with a signature scribbled on top. The one thing Rae yearns for.</p><p><em>Agatha Harkness.</em></p><p>A public figure. A renowned A-lister. A woman they had both seen in magazines, on screens, and in headlines. </p><p>Who could have thought that the beloved Agatha Harkness of hollywood harbors this kind of secret?</p><p>Rae remembers looking up at Rio, searching for guidance and a hint of what this could possibly mean. It was deja vu when Rio squeezed her hand the same way she did when Rae first found out about being adopted.</p><p><em>“Remember, you get to decide what to do with this.”</em> Rio reminded her softly. <em>“It’s your choice. No one else’s.”</em></p><p>Rae’s mind raced, so did her heart. She was in shocked. Then she was in disbelief. After that, she was curios.</p><p>However, she had no sense of obligation to act neither does she had the drive to seek the woman out.</p><p>All Rae had ever wanted was a name, an identity. With that answered, the lingering question mark vanished into thin air. </p><p>And for the first time, the face of the person who had left her in an orphanage was no longer a blur.</p><p>That was enough for Rae.</p><p>The life she has with Rio, with all that she needed and wanted handed freely with endless love and affection, was something Rae would never trade for anyone or anything.</p><p>Besides, even with Rio’s gentle reasoning over the years and her belief of always trying to see the good in people, grown-up Rae is now able to grasp the concept that being given away is just the nicer term for being <em>abandoned</em>.</p><p>Under no circumstances would she ever go looking for someone who had already <strike>given her away</strike>, no, abandoned her.</p><p>But the universe works in twisted ways. Imagine Rae’s surprise when Agatha Harkness appeared not at her doorstep, but at the restaurant named after her.</p><p>Initially, Rae had no intention of approaching her. Rio didn’t even know she was there that night, meaning Rae had no one to consult or rely on if things went sideways.</p><p>Something in her nudged her forward, and before she knew it, Rae was standing at Agatha Harkness’s table, menus in hand.</p><p>She spent countless nights reading articles and blogs about Agatha Harkness, of course she did. </p><p>She consumed every detail of her life and filmography. She gnawed at everything she could reach for as far as the general audience could go.</p><p>Everyone knows Agatha has a sharp tongue, and she isn’t exactly the warm and approachable type. </p><p>Her resting bitch face alone screams she doesn’t give out kindness freely, certainly not to a <em>nobody</em> like Rae.</p><p>It shouldn’t have been a shock when Agatha snapped at Rae the first time they met. Rae tried to keep it casual, to stay cool, but part of her still stung when Agatha treated her the way she did.</p><p>Her <em>own</em> daughter.</p><p>Then again, how could she have recognized her?</p><p>She had abandoned Rae as a baby. How was she supposed to know what her daughter would look like now? What her daughter would grow into?</p><p>Still, Rae had hoped for a connection. Something instinctive, per se. </p><p>The kind Rio always has when Rae is sick, or when she needed something before she ever had to ask.</p><p>Agatha, it turned out, didn’t have that instinct.</p><p>To add insult to injury, it even seemed like she actively dislike Rae. </p><p>A cruel way to meet the woman who gave you life.</p><p>It was never Rae’s intention to reveal who she was—but it happened anyway. She wasn’t expecting a reunion or tears, she wasn’t that naive, but she had hoped for more. </p><p>For something, anything, that proved she had mattered.</p><p>Even once..</p><p>After that night, Rae half-expected Agatha to reach out. She figured she can now be accessible through social media, but Agatha didn’t. No call, no message. Not a peep at all.</p><p>The universe, apparently, wasn’t done with her. For its next big joke, Calderu Acting Workshop turned out to be a surprise collaboration with Agatha Harkness. Though, really, it shouldn’t have been a big reveal after seeing them have dinner together the night before.</p><p>If this was how things were going to be, Rae figured she might as well be difficult about it. </p><p>She decided she wouldn’t shrink despite being forced into Agatha’s orbit.</p><p>She will stand out.</p><p>She will let Agatha see exactly who she’d become. Let her see how perfectly fine Rae is without her.</p><p>She didn’t need explanations or apologies, she had already lived a life without either. </p><p>Rae wore her confidence like armor. It is polished and sharp. She wouldn’t ask for acknowledgment, wouldn’t beg for anything that should have been given freely. </p><p>If Agatha saw her and felt nothing, then that’s on her. </p><p>Rae will learn to live with it.</p><p>“You’re not going anywhere near a vicinity of a wheel <em>ever</em> again.”</p><p>Rae winces as Rio comes back inside, shutting the front door a little harder than usual. </p><p>There’s a faint smell of oil and burned rubber still clinging to her, evidence of the crime scene she just inspected in the garage.</p><p>The Tesla survived. Barely. But at least it did.</p><p>“I swear I wasn’t going anywhere.” Rae says quickly, already backpedaling as she sets her hot cocoa down on the table and stands to face her mother. “I was literally just going to drive around the block.”</p><p>Rio arches a brow. Just one. “<em>My love..</em>” Rio says, her voice soft but with authority. “That does not make it less dangerous.”</p><p>Rae opens her mouth to explain, then she thinks better of it, so she closes it again instead.</p><p>Rio exhales through her nose and runs a hand through her hair, the earlier tension still sitting in her shoulders. “You don’t drive <em>‘around the block’</em> when you don’t have a license. You don’t test vehicles you can’t fully control. And you definitely don’t do it alone in a garage without conscious adults to guide you.”</p><p>“I do know how to drive.” Rae mutters.</p><p>“You know how to sit in a driver’s seat and feel brave.” Rio corrects gently. “That’s not the same thing.”</p><p>She moves closer, resting her hands on Rae’s shoulders. It is not to scold, but to anchor. </p><p>Rae slumps immediately, her posture giving her away. She still smells faintly like cocoa, sugar, and 100% teenage recklessness.</p><p>“What if something went wrong?” Rio continues, quieter now. “What if the brakes didn’t respond? Or you panicked? Or someone else got hurt?”</p><p>Rae swallows. “I didn’t think—”</p><p>“Exactly.” Rio points out. “That’s why I’m thinking for you.”</p><p>There’s a beat.</p><p>Then Rio adds, “I’m cutting your credit card for a week.”</p><p>“A week?” Rae yelps. “That’s a cruel punishment, mother dearest! How could I ever survive my daily trips to the mall without your massive fortune?”</p><p>Rio snorts despite herself, poking her cheek with her tongue. “You’re lucky it’s only a week.”</p><p>Rae groans and drops back onto the couch dramatically. “You left me alone for one evening and suddenly my entire luxury living is over.”</p><p>Rio crosses her arms, watching her with an expression that’s equal parts unimpressed and fond. “I left you alone for one evening and you decided you’d audition for Fast &amp; Furious. Not cool, kid.”</p><p>Rae cracks a smile despite herself.</p><p>Rio sighs, then leans down to press a kiss to the top of her daughter's head. “I love you too much to let you scare me like that.”</p><p>Rae softens instantly, curling into her side. “I know,” She pouts. “I’m sorry, mami.”</p><p>She makes way, moving to the side as Rio joins her on the couch.</p><p>Rio wraps an arm around her without hesitation, pulling her close. “You’re brilliant in about a hundred different ways.” She says, amused. “But, you’re an aggressively bad driver.”</p><p>Rae groans into her shoulder. “That’s what I don’t get. I’m smart. Like, objectively. I can do calculus, physics, and biology. I can easily memorize scripts and long monologues!” She complains with exaggerated hand gestures. “Why am I bad at cars?”</p><p>If being bad at something is genetic, Rae privately decides this one’s on Agatha. </p><p>She’s blaming her.</p><p>Not that she knows if Agatha is bad at driving. She doesn’t know Agatha like that. She might never know Agatha like that. Which is fine. <em>Totally fine.</em> Probably for the best.</p><p>They sit in silence for a moment, the kind that isn’t uncomfortable but definitely isn’t empty either. Rio is watching Rae with that look—the one that means she already knows something and is deciding how to bring it up carefully.</p><p>“Rae?” Rio calls.</p><p>“Mhmm?”</p><p>“You haven’t been entirely honest with me lately, have you?”</p><p>Rae bolts upright like she’s been struck by lightning. Guilt flashes across her face at record speed. “Okay, listen. Before you say anything, I may or may not have misplaced the twenty grand ring you got me, but I swear it’s in my room. I’ve looked everywhere and I will continue looking until I find it. If worst comes to worst, I’ll pick up extra shifts and—”</p><p>“That’s not it.” Rio says calmly.</p><p>Rae pauses. “.. But we are still circling back to the ring later, right?”</p><p>“Oh, absolutely.” Rio replies. “But that’s not what I’m talking about right now.”</p><p>Rae squints. “Then what else? I think I’ve been pretty honest. Like.. real honest. Pinocchio level honesty, except I’m better than him.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t laugh.</p><p>She just looks at Rae directly and says, “<em>You met her.</em>”</p><p>Rae freezes.</p><p>“I met who?”</p><p>“Agatha.”</p><p>And there it is. The secret. The one Rae has been carefully folding up and stuffing into the back of her brain.</p><p>When Rae met Agatha at the restaurant, she made the staff swear to secrecy that she’d never been there that night. No slip-ups and accidental mentions. </p><p>No, <em>hey mami, guess who I met while serving tables.</em></p><p>Not because she wanted to lie to Rio, but because she didn’t want to hurt her. Because she didn’t want it to sound like she was searching. Or reaching. Or replacing.</p><p>Even if Rio said it wouldn’t hurt, Rae wasn’t willing to test that.</p><p>“How’d you know?” Rae asks quietly.</p><p>“She told me.” Rio admits.</p><p>Rae’s head snaps up instantly. “You met her?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“When?”</p><p>“The morning after you did.”</p><p>“What?” Rae squeaks. “Why didn’t you tell me?”</p><p>Rio sighs. “Because I didn’t know how. And because I didn’t want to hurt you.” She pauses. “I’m sorry.”</p><p>Rae swallows. “Does she know you’re my mom?”</p><p>“No.” Rio whispers. “She doesn’t.”</p><p>“But she brought me up, didn’t she?”</p><p>Rio hesitates, then nods. “At dinner.”</p><p>Rae’s eyes widened at the admission. “You had dinner with her?” Her voice rises a pitch higher once more. “Mami, respectfully.. why would you do that? She's an evil incarnate. You might combust being in the same room as her.”</p><p>“Don’t be dramatic.” Rio says, waving a hand. “We both have some explaining to do. You especially. So you’re up. Start talking.”</p><p>Rae groans but caves, recounting everything—her encounter with Agatha at the restaurant, revealing she’s the daughter, and seeing each other again at the workshop. </p><p>When she gets to the part where she tells Rio she’ll be seeing Agatha four times a week, Rio is already rubbing her face in obvious distress.</p><p>“You’re telling me..” Rio says slowly, “That you’re voluntarily spending multiple days a week with Agatha Harkness?”</p><p>“I can handle myself.” Rae insists. “Now it’s your turn. Why are you seeing her?”</p><p>Rio explains honestly. The post run meetup, Instagram messages, and soup delivery. Rae looks personally offended when she tells her about the dinner as well.</p><p>“I wanted to meet her first, I wanted to know her.” Rio says softly, letting her hands rest on Rae’s. “Before she entered your life in any real way. Without bias. Tho, I should’ve told you sooner.”</p><p>Rae blinks, processing it. She appreciated the thought. She really did, but that didn’t stop her from rolling her eyes.</p><p>“So, what do you think of her?”</p><p>Rio hesitates at first, searching for words. “She’s.. quite the woman.”</p><p>Rae didn’t miss a beat. “She’s a bitch.”</p><p>“Language.” Rio’s eyebrows shot up. “And you say that, but you’re still going to her workshop.”</p><p>“It’s a good opportunity, mami.” Rae claims. “Besides, I told you I can handle myself. I can be meaner if I want to.”</p><p>Rio smiles, already knowing she can. “Just.. don’t be <em>too</em> mean. We don’t know the full story yet.”</p><p>Rae huffs but nods, relenting for her mom’s sake. “I can’t promise anything, but if she gets in my way—”</p><p>“Raina.” She knows Rio means business when she calls her that. “Tone down the threats.”</p><p>“Fine, fine! I’ll try to be nice.”</p><p>Rae rolls her eyes dramatically once more. “She’s still a bitch, though. Please don’t hang out with her.”</p><p>They sit quietly for a moment, then Rae says, “You know, she’s not as tall as she looks on TV.”</p><p>“Sure.” Rio suppresses a grin.</p><p>“And she’s really the same as on the news. The sarcastic interviews and press conferences…”</p><p>“I guess?” </p><p>Rae sighs, exasperated but admitting defeat. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but she’s.. <em>way prettier</em> in person. The camera doesn’t do her justice.” She feels her tongue burning by complimenting Agatha. “Still a bitch, though.”</p><p>Rio genuinely laughs this time, then shakes her head. “I agree.”</p><p>Rae arches a brow. “You agree that she’s a bitch?”</p><p>“No, silly.” Rio pokes Rae’s nose. “I agree that she’s <em>really</em> beautiful. On TV.. and certainly in person.”</p><p>Rae tries to ignore it, but the smile on Rio’s face was unmistakable. Rae has to fight the urge to roll her eyes again. “Yeah, okay.. you’re impossible, mami.”</p><p>Rio simply squeezes her hand. “And you love me for it.”</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> hey, can we talk?</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> there’s something important i would like to discuss with you</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> please let me know when you’re free </p></blockquote><p>Well, that was ominous.</p><p>Agatha raises a brow, lips curling slightly at the word <em>important</em>.</p><p>Her brain immediately starts drafting worst-case scenarios because, what exactly is there to talk about with Rio?</p><p>As far as Agatha could recall, dinner had been marvelous.. which obviously meant something terrible was coming next. The universe simply never allows her to enjoy things without consequences, doesn’t it?</p><p>Still, the other night was fantastic. It could’ve gone further too, if Rio hadn’t been summoned home early. Nothing bad had happened on her end. It was pleasant and fun and comfortable.</p><p>So, why did important sound like a threat?</p><p>Is it going to be a confession? A polite <em>we should stop seeing each other</em> speech? A surprise child she didn’t know about?</p><p>Surely it’s not that last one. She already knew about Rio’s kid.</p><p>Ironically, Rio is the one blissfully unaware she is hanging out with a woman who technically has a secret child of her own.</p><p>“I’m pretty sure our parents aren’t paying a ridiculous amount of money just for our so-called mentors to doomscroll through class.” Agatha bit her lower lip, dropping her phone onto the desk the second she hears <em>that </em>familiar voice, followed by her footsteps.</p><p>She looks up and watches as Rae breezes in as if she’s entering a runway rather than a classroom. Red turtleneck, plaid miniskirt, and a matching headband. The whole thing screams teen rom-com protagonist. </p><p>Although knowing Rae, she might actually be more fitting for an antagonist role. Either way, Agatha believes she’s flexible.</p><p>Agatha squints her eyes and shamelessly asses Rae from head to toe. “Were you allowed to watch Clueless for the first time, or is this a cry for help?”</p><p>“Wouldn’t you like to know?”</p><p>Agatha dismisses her as she gestures vaguely at the clock. “Well, class doesn’t start until ten. It’s barely nine. You could’ve been sleeping or doing what is it that you do such as committing minor crimes.”</p><p>“What can I say?” Rae shrugs, smug as ever. “I’m a professional.”</p><p>“Professional what?” </p><p>“Multitasker.” Rae grins, enunciating her words with her usual dramatic flare. “<em>Obviously</em>.”</p><p>Agatha knows exactly why the kid is early. This is her strategic masterplan beyond her ambition and dedication to learn. It gives Rae extra time to torture her, and she’s clearly clocked in for overtime today.</p><p>“Arriving an hour early isn’t as impressive as people think.”</p><p>“Sure it isn’t.” Rae says sweetly, pulling out a chair adjacent to Agatha’s. “But it gives me more time with <em>my</em> mommy, and that’s the real reward.”</p><p>Agatha groans, slumping dramatically. “My worst fear, actually.”</p><p>“Aren’t you a doll?” Rae deadpans.</p><p>“If I was,” Agatha quickly shoots back, “I’d be Annabelle.”</p><p>That pulls a genuine laugh out of Rae. “I admire your self-awareness. Good job.”</p><p>Agatha tries her best not to smile from the compliment, deciding to shift the conversation in a haze. “Did you terrorize an Uber driver on your way here?”</p><p>“My mami gave me a ride, actually.” Rae explains. “She wanted to stop by and meet you, but she had some meeting she couldn’t skip so, rain check, I guess.”</p><p>Agatha freezes for half a second.</p><p>“Oh,” She mutters, far too casually. “That’s.. great. Fantastic, even! I just love spontaneous parent introductions before lunch.”</p><p>She says that with pure sarcasm but deep inside, she’s already spiraling.</p><p>As much as she owes <em>that </em>woman everything, Agatha has absolutely no idea what she’d do if they actually met. Yet.</p><p>She forces a smirk to rebuild her snark and confidence, to show Rae that it didn’t affect her at all. “Tell <em>your </em>mami I’m devastatingly charming in person. Build the anticipation if you must.”</p><p>Rae snorts. “Yeah, no.”</p><p>“That’s rude.”</p><p>“You’re rude.”</p><p>Agatha places a hand over her chest in mock offense. “I am a cultural icon, do not disrespect me.”</p><p>Rae rolls her eyes so hard it’s a miracle they don’t get stuck. “Whatever helps you sleep at night, Harkness.”</p><p>Agatha was taken aback. It was the first time Rae uses her last name like that, as if she’s throwing darts and enjoying the aim. Agatha decides she liked it.</p><p>Silence settles between them, cautious but not uncomfortable. Rae takes out her kindle and starts reading, while Agatha scrolls through her phone some more, checking emails and replying to unread messages.</p><p>For a brief moment, everything almost feels normal, without either of them trying to start a verbal sparring to the other.</p><p>Eventually, the studio door swings open and Lilia claps her hands loudly as a group of kids follow behind.</p><p>“Alright, little thespians! Phones away, bags down, egos checked at the door.” She announces. “You too, Agatha.”</p><p>“Wow.” Agatha mutters. “Singled out again. Story of my life.”</p><p>Rae snickers and heads toward the circle of chairs forming in the middle of the room. Agatha follows, sliding into her usual seat like she owns the place. Technically, she kind of does. Her name on the new brochure definitely helps.</p><p>The room slowly fills with voices of kids of all ages. Awkward preteens, overconfident teens, and a six-year-old who looks like he wandered in by mistake. Everyone buzzes with nervous energy and excitement.</p><p>Lilia claps again. “Today, we’re doing monologues. Volunteers?”</p><p>Silence.</p><p>Agatha leans back with her hands under her chin, clearly enjoying the tension and the energy like it is premium entertainment.</p><p>A teen near the front timidly raises his hand. He’s probably around twelve with freckles across his nose.</p><p>“My man.” Agatha murmurs in approval.</p><p>The boy stands, hands shaking. “Uh.. this is from.. Um, a movie.”</p><p>“Groundbreaking.” Agatha receives an elbow and a glare from Lilia due to the comment.</p><p>He starts—stiff at first, voice cracking. It’s a dramatic scene about losing a friend. A few lines in, he falters.</p><p>Agatha straightens in her chair, her expression softening. “Breathe, sweetheart.” She says. “Don’t rush yourself. Take your time.”</p><p>The boy looks at her, surprised, then nods and continues. His voice steadies as motion and adrenaline finally creeps in. His performance is not perfect, but it’s honest.</p><p>When he finishes, there’s a pause. Agatha made sure to clap first. It’s not even polite clapping. It is a full on unapologetic applause.</p><p>“Yes!” She says. “That was raw. You didn’t rush it like I told you to. You sat in the feeling which is hard to do at your age.”</p><p>The boy beams from her comment.</p><p>“Great feedback, Agatha.” Lilia smiles and continues to share her own thoughts with the entire class.</p><p>Behind it all, Rae stays quiet.</p><p>She doesn’t clap immediately. Not because she doesn’t think he did well. He did, but it’s more because Agatha’s attention feels.. a lot to that boy. It seems like there’s a spotlight Rae isn’t standing in.</p><p>She claps eventually when Lilia concludes with her statement.</p><p>The next volunteer goes up. A girl Rae’s age. She is confident and has a long red hair. She performs a comedic piece, a contrast from the first kid. Both mentors were laughing loudly at all the right moments during the entirety of her piece.</p><p>Rae watches Agatha instead of the girl.</p><p>It’s stupid, she knows. It’s petty. But something twists in her chest anyway.</p><p>Why does it bother her?</p><p>Agatha isn’t anyone to her. She’s just.. Agatha. A <em>nobody</em> in Rae’s life.</p><p>And yet, why is she feeling this way?</p><p>When the girl finishes, Agatha stands halfway out of her chair. “Phenomenal timing. You could do sitcoms, kid.”</p><p>The class went on until Rae’s name is called. “Okay.” Lilia says, “Rae, you’re up.”</p><p>Rae tenses in her chair before standing up.</p><p>Agatha turns, eyebrows raised. “What? Nervous now?”</p><p>“Shut up.” Rae hisses at her, pretending she's not absolutely worried about being judged by Agatha herself.</p><p>She starts her monologue, which is angrier and sharper. It's about betrayal, about not being chosen, which is almost intentional considering their situation.</p><p>During her piece, her eyes flick to Agatha without meaning to. Agatha’s face is unreadable, which makes it worse.</p><p>Rae powers through her performance and finishes strong. Agatha doesn’t clap immediately unlike she did when other kids performed, and that made Rae’s heart sink.</p><p>Finally, there it was. The applause came not only from Agatha and Lilia, but the other kids as well.</p><p>Rae could’ve sworn Agatha’s clap isn’t as loud, but who’s keeping score, honestly?</p><p>“Good.” Agatha says. “Really good. You’ve got bite, but don’t hide behind it.”</p><p>Rae nods at that comment, her jaw tight.</p><p>“Next time,” Agatha adds, “Don’t protect the character so much. Let her be messy, let her be hurt. Allow yourself to feel more.</p><p>Rae forces a shrug. “Yeah. Whatever.” She goes back to her seat and tries to remain invisible for the rest of the class, her enthusiasm for the day suddenly faded instantly.</p><p>The class continues. More kids, even more feedback, and tips along the way. Agatha keeps engaging and encouraging everyone, teaching them how to control their faces or what posture helps more. Rae remains quiet all through out.</p><p>During a short break, Agatha sneaks a glance at her phone and finally replies to Rio’s message.</p><blockquote><p><b>agathaharkness:</b> Define important.</p></blockquote><p>Three dots appear immediately, as if Rio is waiting for her reply the entire time</p><blockquote><p><b>riovidal:</b> it’s nothing bad</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> i think</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> i just want to talk in person about it</p></blockquote><p>Agatha frowns.</p><blockquote><p><b>agathaharkness:</b> That is somehow more terrifying.</p></blockquote><p>This time, no response came from Rio.</p><p>Agatha sighs and slips the phone back into her pocket just as Lilia calls them back for the class to resume.</p><p>When it ended, Agatha noticed that Rae feels.. off.</p><p>She packs up quietly. She didn’t pester Agatha, she even went to join Lilia’s circle when they had a group activity earlier instead of Agatha’s.</p><p>This time, she doesn’t linger. She didn’t throw snarky comments like usual, which feels oddly not Rae.</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha approaches her before she leaves, and before she changes her mind about it. “You good?”</p><p>“Fine.”</p><p>“That’s convincing.”</p><p>Rae didn’t say more as she glares at Agatha before walking away.</p><p>Agatha watches her go, wondering what that kid’s problem is.</p><p>They were fine earlier, weren’t they? At least fine as they could be.</p><p>She replays the class in her head. The way she cheered for everyone, the way she focused on other kids. Now that she thinks about it, she barely interacted with Rae.</p><p>Did she somehow made Rae feel invisible?</p><p><em>Fuck</em>. That thought hurts more than she expects.</p><p>Agatha thinks better of it and decides to run, following Rae. “You did great today.” She calls, walking behind the kid.</p><p>“You say that to everyone.” Rae mutters without looking back.</p><p>“Yeah, but I meant it more for you.”</p><p>Rae stops in her tracks and finally faces Agatha. “You don’t have to. I’m not asking for special treatment.”</p><p>Agatha swallows. “I know. I just.. care.”</p><p>Rae rolls her eyes once more as if that’s the most absurd thing she’s heard today, then leaves.</p><p>Agatha simply stands there, staring at her figure gradually disappearing from her sight.</p><p>For the first time, it really sinks in—she’s been treating Rae like just another student. Worst, she’s not paying attention at all. It’s like Rae is someone she has to keep distance from and stay careful around.</p><p>But Rae isn’t just a student.</p><p>She’s her daughter.</p><p>Albeit not confirmed, Agatha can’t think of her as anything but.</p><p>And the mere idea that Rae might feel overlooked by her sits heavy in her chest.</p><p>She vowed to never become the kind of mother she had growing up. </p><p>Maybe some things are inevitable, no matter how hard you try to avoid it.</p><p>She feels sick to her stomach by just thinking about it.</p><p>Later that day, Agatha meets Jen at a café that looks like it was designed by someone who drinks celery juice before bed. Everything is beige, the menu is written in cursive, and the barista has a nose ring and an attitude.</p><p>She already hates it.</p><p>Jen is seated by the window, sunglasses still on despite being indoors, laptop open while aggressively typing like she’s arguing with trolls online. There’s an empty espresso cup beside her and three unopened sugar packets she clearly didn’t use.</p><p>“You should do a background-check on the barista, he looks suspicious.” Agatha tells her as she drops into the chair across from her friend.</p><p>Jen doesn’t miss a beat. “Give me five minutes.”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes and orders a black coffee because she is bitter, committed to it, and refuses to be perceived as someone who orders oat milk. When it arrives, she doesn’t touch it. </p><p>She watches Jen type with her long nails. Seriously, how can anyone do anything with those?</p><p>“Why do you look like you’re about to tell me I’m banned from award shows?” Agatha asks.</p><p>Jen finally looks up. “That would actually make this easier.”</p><p>“Jenny Kale.” Agatha utters her name, almost a plea that she should get to the point.</p><p>Jen closes her laptop deliberately, preparing for impact. “Okay. So I went to the adoption agency.”</p><p>Agatha stiffens. She didn't expect it would be that fast. “What did you find?”</p><p>“I didn’t break in, if you’re wondering.” Jen says quickly. “I went legally with lawyers I told you about. They were sworn to secrecy, literally.”</p><p>“Of course they are.”</p><p>“They still had archived records.” Jen continues. “Not public, obviously. But once we presented documentation such as birth year, location, hospital—you’d be surprised how cooperative people get when they see legal letterhead.”</p><p>Agatha stares. “You’re terrifying.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Then, Jen exhales. “We had to go through sealed files, court approvals, old social worker records. It took a while, but..”</p><p>She pauses.</p><p>Agatha’s heart starts slapping her ribs with the revelation about to unfold.</p><p>“But,” Jen repeats, softer this time. “<em>It’s her.</em>”</p><p>Agatha freezes. Her fingers curl around her pendant immediately to ground herself.</p><p>Jen meets her eyes, and something in her expression shifts. The usual sarcasm fades, replaced by something careful. Gentle as she can be like she’s about to step on glass.</p><p>“Her name is <em>Raina.</em>” Jen says quietly. “She was born sixteen years ago. Her adoption is finalized in Westview.”</p><p>Agatha’s pulse starts to roar in her ears, loud and fast. Her body already knows what’s coming before her brain catches up.</p><p>“Biological mother—<em>Agatha Harkness</em>.”</p><p>Of course it is her. It has always been her, no matter how hard she tried to deny it, no matter how many excuses she built around the truth.</p><p>Rae really is hers.</p><p>Her blood and flesh.</p><p>Her daughter.</p><p><em>Her’s.</em></p><p>“You’re sure?” Agatha asks, even though she already knows the answer. Even though her heart has accepted it long before her mind did.</p><p>Jen nods. “I triple-checked.”</p><p>Of course she did, Agatha thinks. Of course the universe wouldn’t leave her room to pretend.</p><p>Agatha lets out a shaky breath, the kind that feels like it’s been trapped in her lungs for years. “So.. it’s real. She’s really my daughter.”</p><p>The word tastes strange in her mouth after saying it aloud.</p><p>“Very real.” Jen confirms.</p><p>Agatha stares at the table. Her reflection in the polished wood looks younger. She almost looks scared. Gone are the confidence and her usual bite. Right now, she looks human in a way she doesn’t like.</p><p>“She hates me.” Agatha whispers.</p><p>“She doesn’t know you.”</p><p>“Even worse. Teenagers smell cowardly weakness, it’s their specialty.”</p><p>Jen stays quiet, letting the space fill with Agatha’s thoughts. With every sarcastic remark, every eye roll, every unnecessary jab she threw at Rae without thinking, it all flashes in her mind at this very moment.</p><p>Agatha breathes slowly. “I deserved the way she treats me.” She admits, staring at nothing in particular. “I was.. awful to her. I was genuinely unpleasant to my own child.”</p><p>Jen hums. “You’re mean to everyone.”</p><p>“Mean is generous.”</p><p>“Well then you’re a bitch, sure.” Jen says matter-of-factly, “But I don’t think it came from nowhere.”</p><p>Agatha’s lips twitch. “Oh? Enlighten me.”</p><p>“I think you were scared.” Jen assumes. “You're terrified. So you did what you always do, you turned it into a personality.”</p><p>Agatha swallows. In a way, Jen's not wrong.</p><p>“At first I didn’t want to do anything with her.” Agatha murmurs. “I didn’t want to see myself in her, I didn’t want to care.”</p><p>“But you did.” Jen supplies.</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes. God help her, she did.</p><p>“Yeah,” She whispers. “I really did.”</p><p>Then came more worries. <em>What if she ruin her? What if she already messed it up?”</em></p><p>Jen reaches across the table and squeezes her hand. “You were twenty-five living under your cunt of a mother’s roof. You made the choice you thought would protect her.”</p><p>Agatha smiles, but it's a sad one. “I don’t even remember her face as a baby. Isn’t that horrible?”</p><p>“No.” Jen shrugs. “It’s honest.”</p><p>This time, she lets out a breathy laugh. “She rolls her eyes exactly like me. Clearly, it’s genetic. God forbid I pass on something useful like my memorization skills.” Though she wouldn't know if Rae is good at something. </p><p>How could she?</p><p>“She’s smart.”</p><p>“Of course she is. The universe wouldn’t let me have a dumb kid.” Then, to try ease the heavy tension in her chest, she blurts, “Can you imagine me at a PTA meeting?” </p><p>Jen cackles. “You’d definitely start a feud with the bake sale lady.”</p><p>“She used boxed mix. That is unforgivable and punishable by law.”</p><p>They laugh at that.</p><p>Agatha wipes her eyes. It’s tears from confirming who Rae really is masked by something else. “So it’s really her. Huh.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Jen smiles. “It’s really your kid.”</p><p>Agatha presses a hand to her chest. “I made a human who is now a hormonal teenager.”</p><p>“Terrifying.”</p><p>Agatha chuckles, then goes quiet. “I don’t know how to be her mom.” She admits.</p><p>“You’re already her mom in other ways, Agatha.”</p><p>“I’m gonna screw this up.”</p><p>“Probably.”</p><p>“Thanks for the encouragement, you bitch.”</p><p>“But you’ll try.”</p><p>“Yeah..” Agatha finds herself nodding absentmindedly with that statement. She doesn’t know how, but she knows she’ll do it. “I will.”</p><p>They drifted into conversation of what Agatha should do next, though the truth was she had no plan at all. </p><p>Moreso, she has no idea what to do next so Jen didn’t push. Until then, they can settle for what they know for now and what they have.</p><p>They circled back to Rae, and Agatha found herself dwelling there, talking about her daughter with a mix of awe, guilt, and the tiniest bit of hope tucked between her words, savoring the fact that for once she could think of and speak of Rae without immediately flinching.</p><p>At one point, Jen hesitates, clearly about to mention Rae’s adoptive parents, but Agatha shakes her head before the words can land. She’s not ready to put another face to the ache yet. </p><p>Again, Jen didn’t want to push so reaches into her bag and hands her an envelope instead. </p><p>Agatha takes it carefully, like it might break or <em>break her</em>, and tucks it under her arm without opening it, deciding she can survive one truth at a time.</p><p>Night came, and the town moved on like nothing had shattered inside Agatha’s chest. </p><p>The world didn’t pause for anyone, not even for someone who felt she is entitled for a pause after everything that she’s been through.</p><p>Agatha finds herself in the Westview outlet. She’s wrapped in a long black coat despite the mild weather, oversized scarf hiding half her face, and a dark sunglasses to cover her eyes. </p><p>She keeps her head down, weaving through tourists and bored teenagers, praying no one recognizes her.</p><p>She just wanted to walk and to breathe air without paparazzis following her around.</p><p>She almost never gets to do that when she’s in LA.</p><p>Then of course, essentially the universe throws a joke at her as if it isn’t enough yet.</p><p>She freezes mid-step when she spots a familiar posture near the jewelry kiosk. She would recognize that stiff shoulders and the sharp profile anywhere. Additionally, there’s a black smoke following her around and a pair of horns on top of her head that only Agatha can see.</p><p><em>Evanora</em>.</p><p>Her mother.</p><p>Agatha’s soul leaves her body for a full second. She hasn’t seen her or got in contact with Evanora in the past decade and she would gladly like to keep it that way.</p><p>“Absolutely not.” She mutters under her breath.</p><p>She ducks behind a taco stand so fast she nearly bump her head. Her heart pounds while she peeks through the display. </p><p>Evanora looks the same as ever—meaning, she looks like an old hag with wrinkles no amount of botox can fix.</p><p>Agatha waits until she disappears into a boutique before moving again. She won’t deal with that cunt unless she absolutely has to which translates to: <em>never</em>.</p><p>For now, the crisis has been successfully avoided. Agatha exhales in relief and abruptly, she nearly walks straight into Rae.</p><p><em>Fucking hell</em>. Is there some sort of Harkness reunion happening that she doesn’t know of tonight?</p><p>The kid is holding several shopping bags with designer logos. She’s changed her clothes too because apparently, one outfit a day is not enough for her.</p><p>Agatha can relate, so she takes note of that.</p><p>“Well, damn.” She murmurs to herself. “<em>My</em> daughter is loaded.”</p><p>She watches from a distance as Rae scrolls through her phone, chewing gum while walking.</p><p>Agatha’s brain spirals immediately upon realizing what she’s doing.</p><p>Here she is sneaking around like a raccoon, observing her daughter who is casually carrying bags on a random thursday which is probably worth more than a car.</p><p>“Guess the adoption agency really upgraded you.” </p><p>She considers leaving. She should leave—<em>must</em> leave, but guilt is louder than common sense.</p><p>She figures she might apologize to Rae again for what she has done earlier. Heck, for what she has done the past sixteen years if she were being honest.</p><p>So Agatha follows her at a safe distance while rehearsing the apologies in her head.</p><p><em>I’m sorry I panicked.</em><br/><em>I’m sorry I’m emotionally constipated.</em></p><p><em>I'm sorry I didn't know earlier.</em></p><p><em>I should have known.</em></p><p>She’s just about to speed up and call Rae when she accidentally collides with someone else, making her stop in her tracks.</p><p>“Jesus—” Agatha snaps, steadying herself.</p><p>“Agatha?”</p><p>She knows that voice. <em>Rio</em>.</p><p>There she is in casual clothes, hair loose, and a small smile on her lips showing her gap tooth.</p><p>Agatha’s brain short-circuits at the thought of the woman before her.</p><p>“Oh,” She gasps. “You.”</p><p>Rio laughs. “Wow, that’s a warm welcome.”</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Agatha asks, which she realizes is stupid after it went out of her mouth.</p><p>Rio dodges the questions and points at her scarf and sunglasses insead. “Are you in witness protection?”</p><p>“Incognito.” Agatha corrects, removing her eyewear to avoid being rude. “It’s a lifestyle.”</p><p>Rio’s smile falters slightly. Not obvious, but Agatha sure notices it.</p><p>Then, she remembers the messages.</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms. “So, since fate shoved us together, what’s this important thing you wanted to discuss?”</p><p>Rio hesitates as her eyes flick past Agatha’s shoulder.</p><p>Agatha looks back consciously but sees nothing unusual. “What?”</p><p>Rio clears her throat. “It’s just.. maybe this is not the best place to talk about it.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha inquires. “Are you about to confess you’re secretly married? Or part of the mafia? Don't tell me you're a serial killer.”</p><p>“No..”</p><p>Before Agatha can push past the awkward tension, another familiar voice cuts through the air. “Well, isn't it a small world we live in.”</p><p><em>Rae</em>. Of course. </p><p>Agatha turns slowly, almost ceremoniously, to face her daughter. </p><p>Rae stands there, smirk locked, designer shopping bags dangling from her arms like shiny little trophies. She tilts her head between the adults, her eyes glinting with suspicious delight, the kind of look that says she already knows exactly what chaos she’s stirring.</p><p><em>My kid.</em> Agatha thinks. <em>My actual kid.</em> She’s.. enormous. Not physically, thank God, but somehow she already occupies all the chambers of Agatha’s heart.</p><p>“Didn’t expect to see you two bonding.” Rae says, voice sweet but sharp, perfectly timed. “What is this, a crossover episode?”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth, tries to say something, but no single syllable comes out.</p><p>Rae steps closer, locking her free arm with Rio’s, and Agatha’s stomach drops.</p><p>“This is <em>my</em> mami.” Rae announces. “She’s the one who took me in after you gave me away.”</p><p>Her eyes are bright with mischief and challenge as she continues, “You’ve met her, obviously.”</p><p>Agatha’s brain explodes in slow motion.</p><p><em>Mami</em>. </p><p>Rae’s mami, is Rio?</p><p>Suddenly, it clicked. It's a puzzle piece snapping into place, painfully obvious in hindsight. </p><p>She remembers the first time she met Rio—how tense she had seemed, how she always looked like she was about to say something important but somehow held herself back.</p><p>And then, there's <em>Raina.</em></p><p>Jen had said the name. She’d mentioned it casually, and Agatha had been too distracted by the whirlwind of her own emotions to notice. She was too focused to realize that Rae’s real name.. the one buried in papers, was in fact Raina.</p><p>The same Raina Rio had been on the phone the other night.</p><p>How could she have been so stupid?</p><p>Her throat tightens and her lips twitch. She wants to scream, to laugh, to run, and stay still all at once. Meaning, she doesn’t know what to do.</p><p>Rio stiffens beside her, and Agatha sees it. The protective weight she carries, the careful boundaries that just shifted a little under Rae’s small hand. </p><p>She’s.. <em>maternal</em>.</p><p>“Oh.” Agatha finally breathes. “You have got to be kidding me.”</p><p>Rae tilts her head. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Agatha laughs. “Nothing. The universe really has jokes set out on me.”</p><p>Rio looks panicked. “Agatha—”</p><p>“So,” Agatha cuts in, voice steady despite the sudden weight in her chest, “This is why you wanted to talk.”</p><p>Her eyes flick back to Rio. The flirting. The soup. The dinner. The way she’d been drawn in without realizing it.</p><p>Her daughter’s <em>mother</em>.</p><p>Her chest tightens more as time goes on. It feels like someone shoved a fist inside and refused to let go.</p><p>Her brain keeps repeating it like a chant. Her daughter’s mother.</p><p><em>Rae’s mami.</em></p><p>Of course the universe has its twist. Because, why wouldn’t the woman she’s been casually flirting with, be the person who raised her kid?</p><p>Agatha laughs again, quieter this time, the sound lighter but still tinged with disbelief.</p><p>Rio swallows. “Agatha, I didn’t—I mean, I wanted to tell you, I just.. there was never a right moment.”</p><p><em>There is never a right moment to tell someone you’ve been flirting with that you’re their daughter’s adoptive mother, but sure.</em></p><p>Rio steps closer, cautious, like Agatha might spook. “She’s a good kid.”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha says, crossing her arms like she needs the barrier, “You’re rich, you cook, and you raised her. That’s quite the résumé you’ve got there.”</p><p>Rio lets out a small, awkward laugh, rubbing the back of her neck. “When you say it like that, I sound like a superhero.”</p><p>She straightens her posture as she’s about to say something else—something that might actually matter but Rae steps in front of her like a human barricade.</p><p>The way she moves is almost defensive, as if she’s shielding her mami from Agatha.</p><p>Agatha tries not to let that get into her head.</p><p>“Okay.” Rae says, clapping her hands once. “We’re done here.”</p><p>Rio blinks. “We are?”</p><p>“Come on, mami.” Rae begins to pull Rio away. “You promised we’d get boba. And I am emotionally unstable without sugar.”</p><p>Rio hesitates, eyes flicking back to Agatha, something unsaid hanging between them. “Rae—”</p><p>“Mami, please.” Rae insists, yanking Rio’s arm harder. “Let’s leave now before we corrupt our minds by hanging too much with her.”</p><p>She shoots Agatha a look. A guarded one, like she’s already built a protective wall between them.</p><p>Agatha watches it happen. The casual way Rae leans into her. The way Rio automatically adjusts her grip on the shopping bags so Rae doesn’t have to carry them. The way their bodies already know each other’s rhythms.</p><p>Rae meets her gaze. “Don’t get any ideas. This sudden meetup isn’t a weekly thing.”</p><p>Agatha forces a half-smile. “Heartbroken already.”</p><p>“Good.” Rae replies flatly. “Stay that way.”</p><p>Rae pulls Rio away decisively, like she’s afraid staying any longer might mean something. Rio glances back, hesitates, then mouths a small, apologetic <em>bye</em>.</p><p>They disappear into the crowd, blending in like every other mother and daughter in the mall. They continue living a life Agatha only knows from a distance.</p><p>While Agatha stays where she is, hands in her pockets, sixteen years crashing into her chest all at once.</p><p>Back in the quiet comfort of Lilias’ guest bedroom, Agatha finally lets herself stop pretending she’s fine.</p><p>Rae is her daughter.</p><p>The words don’t feel real yet. They float around her head like something from a bad script she hasn’t memorized. </p><p>She lost sixteen years of her daughter’s life.</p><p>Missed birthdays. Missed scraped knees. Missed first crushes and first heartbreaks and every tiny moment in between.</p><p>And of course, there’s Rio. The beloved mami. <em>Rae’s mami.</em></p><p>Agatha presses her lips together like she can physically keep that word from sinking in. The way Rae said it is natural and easy, she made it seem like it is the safest word she knows.</p><p>And maybe it really is.</p><p>She sits on the edge of the bed and stares at her hands. The same hands that once held a newborn she was too scared to keep. The same hands that just hours ago were shoved into her coat pockets while her daughter walked away with someone else.</p><p><em>This is your doing</em>, she tells herself. <em>You chose this.</em></p><p>Her chest aches in a quiet, persistent way. It reminds her that this isn’t something she can joke her way out of.</p><p>A few minutes in and her phone buzzes.</p><p>Speaking of. She receive a message from Rio on instagram. </p><p>She doesn’t open it right away. She lets it sit, she refuse to look desperate on Rio’s end when she replies quickly.</p><p>Eventually, she opens the notification.</p><blockquote><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> i know i should’ve told you sooner</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> i’m sorry</p></blockquote><p>Her thumbs hover over the screen as she types, deletes, types again, and deletes again.</p><p>Every sentence feels wrong. Frankly, she doesn’t know what to say.</p><p>Agatha isn’t sure what she’s feeling toward Rio, and that somehow makes it worse. </p><p>A hint of anger sits there for keeping her in the dark, but it doesn’t burn the way she expects it to. It just simmers quietly as she wonder where to put it.</p><p>Why did Rio hide it from her? Does she have hidden agenda? Or was she simply protecting Rae?</p><p>Or maybe.. she was protecting Agatha, sparing her from a truth she wasn’t ready to face. </p><p>Agatha turns the questions over in her head again and again. She tells herself that if she finds the right angle, it’ll finally make sense.</p><p>And then there’s the flirting. God. It feels <em>wrong</em> now. She crossed a line she didn’t even know existed. </p><p>In the end, she locks her phone and tosses it onto the bed beside her.</p><p>She settles with silence. No reply.</p><p>Not tonight.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>An uneventful week passes since the incident (Or the <em>Harkness </em>reunion, unbeknownst to the people involved except Agatha) occurred.</p><p>Rio doesn’t push. And annoyingly, that’s a relief.</p><p>Agatha hasn’t heard from her since leaving her on read in those Instagram DMs. She admits she’s sort of surprised to see no follow-ups such as a simple,<em> “Hey, just checking in,” </em>message the morning after.</p><p>Agatha honestly thought Rio would be the type to do something small but intentional. From what little she thought she knew, Rio seemed like <em>that</em> kind of woman.</p><p>Clearly, she was wrong.</p><p>Then again, did she actually know Rio at all? The woman couldn’t even bring herself to say she was her daughter’s adoptive mother. That feels like a pretty major detail to skip over.</p><p>Sure. Who’s holding a grudge? <em>Not</em> Agatha. Definitely not her. </p><p>She has proclaimed herself to be an expert when it comes to emotional constipation and betrayal.</p><p>She tells herself it’s for the best.</p><p>Getting tangled up with Rio would only complicate things. Her relationship with Rae is already hanging by a thread so thin it might as well be nonexistent. The last thing she needs is to step on a landmine by getting involved with her daughter’s mami—especially when said daughter is clearly ready to throw hands if anyone even looks at her mami wrong.</p><p>And as much as she seems to enjoy messing with Rae over petty things, she’s well aware that it’s a line she couldn't cross. She will not attempt messing with her mami.</p><p>Along with that, she manages to convince herself this is maturity. This is the kind of growth and self-control she must apply in her life more as a functional adult.</p><p>But then, that stupid little voice in her head simply would not stop talking: <em>Wow, she dropped you fast. Guess you were forgettable, after all.</em></p><p>Agatha finds offense at that.</p><p>She’s Agatha Harkness, for fuck’s sake. She’s anything <em>but</em> unforgettable.</p><p>Still.. deny it as she might, it does stings. Just a little. </p><p>She tries to be fair about it. She tries to justify Rio’s actions by putting herself on the other woman’s shoes.</p><p>Maybe Rio reached the same conclusion Agatha did, just faster and with less emotional spiraling. Maybe she decided Rae comes first, no matter what. And maybe, through some weird unspoken agreement, they’ve both decided to back off for the kid’s sake.</p><p><em>Unconscious telepathy: coparenting edition,</em> though they’re actually not coparenting in any sense. Still, Agatha finds humor in her situation.</p><p>Above all, she’d be lying if she said she didn’t miss it. With the brief time spent together, the easy banters and flirting felt harmless in the moment. For a second there, she’d felt someone saw past the armor she had long created and didn’t immediately run.</p><p>Shame it had to end so fast, and shame at herself to have enjoyed it at all.</p><p>Rae, on the other hand, had very clearly been avoiding her.</p><p>The kid still participated actively in class. She excels as usual, volunteers to be the first to perform at almost every activity—but she only ever directed her attention at Lilia. </p><p>With Agatha, it was strictly professional. They only converse when it’s time for feedback, and even then Rae simply nods or hums at whatever she says. </p><p>Gone are the banter and side comments. She even refuses eye contact longer than necessary. Every time Agatha tried to approach her, Rae drifted away like she’d rehearsed it.</p><p>The only time Rae acknowledged Agatha was when she came in late, coffee splashed down her blouse after an incident at the café outside her neighborhood that involves one clumsy barista.</p><p>When she arrived, her eyes had met Rae’s across a sea of students. She didn’t miss the way Rae had snickered.</p><p>The kid looks delighted. She was absolutely thriving at Agatha’s public humiliation.</p><p>Agatha would take that. She’d take anything. Even a verbal assassination, if Rae felt like offering one. At least it meant the kid was still looking at her.</p><p>It’s a strange kind of internal shame. Now that she knows Rae is her daughter, Rae seems to find every possible way to slip through her fingers. She keeps distance as if getting close to Agatha might somehow hurt her.</p><p>Agatha would never hurt her.. She would <em>never</em>.</p><p>She gave her up so Rae wouldn’t be hurt. That was the whole point. It is the logic she clings to and the sacrifice she bleeds from.</p><p>Still, it feels odd. To be in the same vicinity with Rae without any sarcastic comebacks does something to her heart. It aches, in a way.</p><p>She misses her daughter, she absolutely does.</p><p>Not being able to admit that part out loud is a different level of shame.</p><p>“Wanda’s the redhead, right?” Jen asks, flipping through music on the radio while Agatha drives, eyes fixed on the road. “Isn’t she the one you said lives a pretentious suburban life with her husband and two kids?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. She did say that, and she wasn’t entirely wrong. “Ex-husband.” She corrects. “The divorce got finalized earlier this year. Or was it last year? Doesn’t matter.”</p><p>Wanda had sent her an invite for a small housewarming party. Apparently, she’d just bought a new place, and after finding out Agatha was in town, she made sure to reach out. </p><p>Typical Wanda Maximoff. She’s polite, thoughtful, and always trying to keep old connections alive.</p><p>They’d met when Agatha was just starting out in showbiz. Wanda had been a casting director on one of her early films. They bonded over being from the same nowhere town of Westview and their mutual hatred at a certain Tony Starks from the industry.</p><p>Agatha wouldn’t say they were tight. Not really. They drifted once Wanda’s kids were old enough for school and her personality-less husband decided they should move back to Westview. </p><p>Wanda became a housewife. She settled into that <em>picture-perfect-pretentious</em> suburban life Agatha loved to mock.</p><p>They texted sometimes, never missing each other’s birthdays. Agatha sends gifts to her sons on christmas, which is always money or gift cards. They grabbed lunch whenever Wanda flew to L.A., which wasn’t often. Still, Agatha considers her one of her oldest friends, even with the distance and the years in between.</p><p>“I love that for her.” Jen sighs, finally settling back into her seat. “I could never imagine myself with a man. Women, on the other hand, think I’m too difficult. At this rate, I’ll probably die alone with no spouse and no kids.”</p><p>Agatha snorts, because honestly? Same. Rae is her daughter, yes, but not <em>technically</em> hers. And tying herself down to anyone in the near future sounds about as appealing as jury duty. </p><p>So really, they’re both doomed in different fonts.</p><p>They pull up to the address Wanda sent. They were greeted by a two-story modern house tucked into a quiet neighborhood on the upper side of Westview. Still suburban, just less pretentious now that there’s no husband lurking around.</p><p>“Agatha!” Wanda greets them, already tipsy, glass of wine in hand as she rushes out onto the patio. One thing Agatha has always loved about her is that drinking at inappropriate times has never been an issue. “Hon, I’m so glad you made it!”</p><p>They share a quick hug. “Happy to be here.” Agatha says, handing over the housewarming gift. It is a basket of supposedly useful nonsense Jen curated. “And if you remember, this is my assistant, Jennifer.”</p><p>“Jen.” She corrects with a grin, shaking Wanda’s hand. “Beautiful house, by the way.”</p><p>“Thank you!” Wanda beams, then leans in to whisper dramatically, “I think it’s haunted. Got it for twenty percent off the market price. But honestly? As long as people tell me it’s beautiful, I won’t mind living with ghosts.”</p><p>They laugh, and Wanda leads them to the backyard where the party is in full swing. A pool, a buffet table, and a balloon arch in blue and pink like someone accidentally booked a baby shower decorator. Knowing Wanda’s whimsy, it was definitely not an accident.</p><p>Wanda tries to bring Agatha to meet the twins, but they’ve apparently vanished into the void, so instead she parades her around to other guests who immediately start gushing. Wanda half-heartedly tells them not to smother her, but Agatha secretly enjoys the attention.</p><p>As conversations blur together, somewhere between her second glass of wine and a stranger calling her “iconic,” Agatha realizes her phone isn’t with her. </p><p>She probably left it in the car so she excuses herself, leaving Jen happily absorbed in Wanda’s chaotic storytelling.</p><p>On her way out, she sees a teen leaning against the front doorway, black scarf wrapped around his neck despite the weather, scribbling in a notebook like he’s drafting his tragic memoir.</p><p>There's one of two.</p><p>“Well, if it isn’t Bruno..” Agatha says fondly, walking up to him.</p><p>The teen looks up, black ink heavy around his eyes, curls falling into his face. <em>Damn</em>. Wanda really raised an emo.</p><p>“It’s <em>Billy.</em>” He corrects politely, slipping the notebook into his pocket as he stands. “Nice to see you again, Aunt Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha smiles. The twins are a year older than Rae, if she remembers correctly. For a split second, she wonders: if she had raised her.. would Rae be here too?</p><p>“No wonder your mom keeps complaining about losing her eyeliner.” Agatha lies. “You clearly stole it all.”</p><p>Billy shrugs, grinning. “I appreciate the compliment.”</p><p>“Auntie Agatha!” A louder voice calls, followed by its heavy footsteps.</p><p>They both turn to see his twin sprinting toward them, sweat all over his body and arms wide open. “Wouldn’t you give your favorite nephew a hug?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha deadpans, planting her hand on his face before he can get closer. “God, Timothy. Couldn’t bother changing?”</p><p>“I was on the treadmill.” He protests. “And it’s <em>Tommy</em>.”</p><p>Agatha knows that. She just enjoys getting it wrong.</p><p>The last time she saw them, they were barely eleven. Now they’re towering over her like ungrateful weeds. </p><p>“BTW, the cash you gave me last christmas was fire!” Tommy announces proudly. “Paid for, like, three dates. With three different girls, mind you.”</p><p>Agatha winces and looks at Billy instead. “Is something wrong with your brother? You should probably get him checked.”</p><p>Billy laughs. “He’s just like that.”</p><p>“How long are you staying in town, Auntie?” Tommy asks, rocking on his heels. “We should take you out for dinner. Mom’s friends with this <em>famous </em>chef and her restaurant is absolutely bomb. Reservations are impossible, but we can totally get in. We just have to make sure a <em>certain someone</em> isn’t working when we go.”</p><p>Agatha physically shivers at the words <em>chef</em>, <em>restaurant</em>, and <em>reservation</em>. The universe wouldn’t be that cruel, right?</p><p>“Yeah.” Billy supplies, eyes widening. “And I think that’s Auntie Rio parking over there.. wait—shit, Tommy. Auntie Rio is here. She’s here!”</p><p>And there it is. <em>Auntie</em> Rio. Fuck her life.</p><p>Can Westview get any smaller, or is it just actively trying to ruin her?</p><p>Agatha follows Billy’s gaze and spots a sleek silver Bentley pulling up on the side of the road. Her stomach drops. It’s been over a week since she last saw Rio, and apparently the universe chose <em>now</em> for their reunion. </p><p>“Wait.. she’s here?” Tommy whisper-screams. “I thought Mom said she wasn’t coming?” His eyes go wide, his face turning pale by the second. “Oh god, Rae is going to kill me.”</p><p>That’s when it clicks. If Rio is here.. Rae is probably here too.</p><p>“Wait, you know Rio?” Agatha blurts out, suddenly dizzy by the sudden revelation. “And Rae?”</p><p>“Heck yeah.” Billy confirms, immediately ducking behind Agatha like she’s a human shield. “Mom’s friends with Rio. We go to school with Rae. This idiot,” He jerks a thumb at his brother, “Dated one of Rae’s friends for two days and then dumped her. Now she’s furious.”</p><p>“It was three days!” Tommy looks genuinely traumatized. “The last threat she gave me was that she’d burn my gym equipment and make it look like a freak accident. I’m not letting that happen.”</p><p>With that, he bolts. Before Agatha can make a sense of what’s happening, Tommy’s already gone. His survival mode was triggered by the mere thought of Rae.</p><p>Agatha presses her palm to her forehead. She can feel a migraine forming. Threats at such a young age further proves that it’s really her daughter, apparently.</p><p>“And what did <em>you</em> do?” She turns to Billy.</p><p>“Nothing, I swear!” He panics. “But since Tommy messed with her, she says she’s coming after our entire bloodline for hurting her friend’s feelings.”</p><p>Agatha stares. “Jesus Christ.”</p><p>From the corner of her eye, she sees Rio step out of the car with sunglasses on. She’s looking unfairly calm for someone about to wreck Agatha’s entire nervous system. Might as well include her cardiac, too.</p><p>Billy visibly shudders. “Yup. I’m hiding ‘cause I’m afraid even if I’m in the comfort of my own house. I can’t do this.” He backs away slowly. “Nice seeing you, Auntie Agatha!” And with that, he runs away too.</p><p>Agatha stands there alone after the twins literally left her, staring at Rio across the driveway, heart pounding like it’s auditioning for the <em>fastest heartbeat in a minute</em> race.</p><p>Great. Absolutely fantastic timing, universe.</p><p>Rio only notices her when she’s already halfway across the driveway.</p><p>Agatha considers sprinting upstairs like the twins just did. Maybe she should lock herself in the bathroom to avoid any interaction, but it’s too late. Rio is only a few steps away now, close enough that Agatha can smell her perfume and regret all her life choices.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio calls, like she’s saying the name just to check if it’s real. “What are you doing here?”</p><p>“What are you doing here?” Agatha shoots back.</p><p>Rio blinks, clearly thrown, but she recovers immediately. “I know Wanda. Our kids.. well, they go to the same school.”</p><p>Of course Rio is the kind of parent who knows other parents. She probably has complete attendance on PTA meetings or doesn't start a petty feud with the bake sales lady for using a boxed mix. </p><p>Agatha should build her a shrine for her moral superiority.</p><p>“And you?” Rio asks, sliding her sunglasses off and pushing them onto her head. She pauses, as if realizing something. “Right. Wanda used to be a casting director.”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha mutters.</p><p>They stand there in a painfully awkward silence that stretches for far too long. How do you exactly talk to the woman you flirted with who turns out to be your daughter’s adoptive mother? There’s no manual for that.</p><p>Agatha mentally adds <em>to write a handbook</em> to her to-do list.</p><p>“Agatha, listen..” Rio starts, her voice softening. “I should really apologize for—”</p><p>“Rio!” Wanda’s voice cuts in cheerfully as she appears, holding yet another glass of wine like it’s a personality trait. “I’m so glad you made it!”</p><p>“Hi, Wands.” Rio smiles warmly, turning her attention to the host. “Congratulations on the house. It’s lovely.”</p><p>“Thank you, hon! It’s haunted with ghosts, but I’m coping.” Wanda chuckles, clearly reusing her favorite line. Then she looks between them. “And you’ve met Agatha! Or perhaps you two already know each other?”</p><p>“We do.” Agatha says quickly, before Rio can answer. “Her daughter goes to our workshop.”</p><p>“Oh!” Wanda lights up. “Speaking of, where’s darling Rae?”</p><p>Hmm, where is Rae?</p><p>As much as she would love to see her daughter, Agatha actually prays she’s nowhere near this driveway. Having Rio is one thing. Having Rae is another. She wouldn’t know what to do or how to act around those two, maybe she’d combust on the spot and she really does <em>not</em> want to combust right now.</p><p>“She has ballet.” </p><p>“Rae does ballet?!” </p><p>Both Wanda and Rio turn to her when her voice raises a pitch higher.</p><p>Well, excuse her for not knowing that. When she looked for Rae’s social media, the kid doesn’t exactly post her hobbies online, which is a good thing to avoid lurking creeps (not Agatha). </p><p>Besides, Agatha can barely dance without spraining something, so forgive the shock.</p><p>“Yes.” Rio smiles. “Not as much now as when she was younger. Her old coaches still text her sometimes, and she’ll drop by to help teach kids under ten when she feels like it.”</p><p>Huh. Definitely didn’t get that from Agatha.</p><p>“She’s one busy kid.”.</p><p>“I let her do whatever she loves to do.” Rio informs her. “She says it makes her feel alive.”</p><p>Their eyes meet, blue and brown, as if a sense of understanding is being shared. A moment passes that feels heavier than it should. It feels like they’re having a conversation neither of them is brave enough to say out loud.</p><p>“Okay!” Wanda suddenly claps her hands, stepping between them. “What if we continue this very intense staring contest in the backyard? There’s food and actual chairs, that should be tempting enough.”</p><p>Well, who are they to refuse the lady of the house?</p><blockquote><p><b>Jennifer Kale: </b>that HOT WOMAN is what???!!!.slo33edoij</p><p><b>Agatha Harkness: </b>Is calling her hot necessary?</p><p><b>Jennifer Kale: </b>i acknowledge facts and i live in the beauty of truth</p><p><b>Jennifer Kale:</b> so…. that really is rio vidal?</p><p><b>Jennifer Kale: </b>the same rio vidal who adopted rae?</p><p><b>Agatha Harkness:</b> I thought you looked her up.</p><p><b>Agatha Harkness: </b>But, yes.</p><p><b>Agatha Harkness:</b> Stop staring at her you freak!

The alcohol burns, reminding her that she is not a tragic character in a badly written soap opera.</p><p>“Mind if I join you?” Rio asks with a small smile.</p><p>Agatha glances around. The table is boxed in by people, chairs pushed too close, no clean escape route. She is trapped and couldn’t think of a better excuse to run.</p><p>The universe is very committed to its bit tonight.</p><p>“Free country.”</p><p>Rio pulls out the chair in front of her, and for a moment, they just exist there. The air between them is thick but not sharp anymore. It has become cautious, both of them fully aware they’re tiptoeing over a tripmine that might explode any second with one wrong move.</p><p>Or, one wrong word.</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio starts carefully, “I’m really sorry for not telling you sooner. About Rae. I should’ve said something the moment I realized who you were.”</p><p>“Why didn’t you?” Agatha asks quietly.</p><p>“Didn’t what?”</p><p>“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?” Her voice doesn’t bite this time. It simply asks.</p><p>Rio exhales slowly, like she’s been holding this in for days. “I told you but uh.. it’s because I wanted to know you first.” She admits. “A screening process, if you will.”</p><p>Agatha raises an eyebrow, clearly unconvinced.</p><p>“I’ve always been protective of Rae.” Rio continues, fingers twisting together in her lap. “She’s my baby, no matter how old she gets. And you—” She hesitates, searching for the right words, “You were orbiting close to her life without even knowing it.”</p><p>Agatha tries to deliberately keep her face neutral while the other woman speaks.</p><p>“We know you on screen.” Rio says, voice wavering. “But we don’t actually <em>know</em> you. At least I don't, and that scared me.”</p><p>“I’ve spent sixteen years building something safe for her. A life where she knows she’s loved. Where she doesn’t have to wonder if she’s wanted.” Rio does the thing where she pokes her tongue at the side of her cheek. “I still don’t know you. I didn’t know your reasons back then but I’m sure it is to give Rae chance at a better life, and I will never judge you for what you did for I know what kind of sacrifice you had to make, but..”</p><p>She keeps her gaze towards Agatha this time, holding it as long as she can. “I don’t want to open the door to someone who might walk out again.”</p><p>Agatha’s chest tightens. Well, that went straight to her vena cava. <em>Ouch</em>.</p><p>“I couldn’t risk her getting attached and then getting hurt.” Rio admits. “Not by anyone. Not even by you.” There it is. Raw. Honest. Vulnerable. She’d give her that.</p><p>“So I thought.. if I knew you first,” Rio says quietly, her eyes dropping to her hands, “Maybe I could decide for myself if you were someone safe to let into my daughter’s life.”</p><p>She lets out a shaky laugh. “That sounds awful when I say it out loud, I’m sorry.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t interrupt. She just listens.</p><p>“But you have to understand..” Rio continues, voice cracking, “I had no bad intentions. None. I swear. I just.. I didn’t want her to get hurt. I only want what’s best for her, Agatha. That’s all I’ve ever wanted.”</p><p>And the thing is, as much as she hates being lied to—Agatha understands.</p><p>She doesn’t like it. She won't forget it instantly, but she gets it. </p><p>Because if the roles were reversed, if someone unknown and unpredictable was drifting too close to her kid, she would’ve done worse than background checks and casual dinner. She would’ve gone full detective mode. </p><p>So yeah, the secrecy stings, but beneath that?</p><p>She sees a mother who was scared.  A woman who built a life around protecting one small human and refused to let it crack.</p><p>Agatha can’t fault her for that. Not when she would’ve done the same.</p><p>“But it turns out I was already too late.” Rio chuckles, trying to ease the tension. “This whole time, you were already in her life. Or, she was in yours. That one is inevitable beyond my control.”</p><p>Agatha hums, lifting her glass and studying the liquid like it might suddenly reveal the secrets of the universe. She does what she always does when she doesn’t know what to do.</p><p>“You know..” She finally speaks, “I once ghosted my own therapist for six months.”</p><p>It’s easier than admitting she understands. Easier than saying <em>thank you for protecting her</em> or <em>I’m scared too</em> or <em>I don’t know how to do this right.</em></p><p>She’s not there yet.</p><p>Who knows one day she will be, but that day is definitely <em>not</em> today.</p><p>Rio blinks, trying to process what Agatha just said. “That feels.. unrelated.”</p><p>“Is it?” Agatha shrugs. “Avoidance is a lifestyle choice, I guess.”</p><p>“You’re deflecting.” Rio points out, smiling a little. “But, sure. May I know what happened with that therapist?”</p><p>“It’s confidential, I pay to make whatever I say stay between me and her.” Agatha takes another sip. “So, ballet?”</p><p>“What?”</p><p>“Rae.” Agatha says, suddenly very interested in the condensation on her glass. “You said she does ballet. Which is insane, by the way, because I have the coordination of a malfunctioning squid.”</p><p>Rio laughs softly. “She’s actually really good.”</p><p>“Of course she is.” Agatha rolls her eyes. “She couldn’t inherit <em>one</em> of my flaws.” That statement made Rio laugh louder.</p><p>“Uh, she started when she was little.” Rio begins to explain. “Five, I think. I took her to watch her first Nutcracker show in Paris..”</p><p>“She went to Paris when she was five?” Agatha gasps, eyes wide.</p><p>Rio ducks her head shyly, rubbing the back of her neck. “It was actually a Europe tour with my parents and sister.”</p><p>“Europe?” Agatha repeats, louder now. “She went to Europe when she was <em>five</em>?” The words hit her all at once, and suddenly she’s picturing tiny Rae with a passport bigger than her hand. </p><p>“She’s travelled a lot more than I did when I was a kid, that much I can tell you.”</p><p>“God. You really gave her a good life, didn’t you?” There’s awe in Agatha’s voice and a quieter something else. <em>Gratitude</em>. </p><p>Rae got to experience things Agatha never did growing up. Now, equipped with the knowledge that Rae’s world was bigger, brighter, and safer than her own ever was?</p><p>That’s a kind of peace she didn’t know she needed.</p><p>“I really hope I did.” Rio smiles at her, once again showing her gapped tooth. “So the show was almost five hours and we were really impressed that a young kid managed to go through all that without tantrums. She was just sitting there with her pink tutu and glittery water bottle, absolutely amused by the performances.”</p><p>“Let me guess, Clara is her favorite character?”</p><p>“You bet.” Rio grins. “When it was over, she begged me for lessons. She said she wanted to do ballet like the ones she just saw and only then she threw tantrums. She cried in the theater when I told her we couldn’t go to Paris <em>every</em> weekend just so she can attend exclusive Nutcracker classes, or whatever it was called.”</p><p>Agatha winces. “She cries? That’s new information.”</p><p>“Oh, she’ll deny it.” Rio waves. “But yeah. She cried. It was a full dramatic meltdown, I told her she can take ballet classes in Westview <em>and</em> she can buy anything she likes at Disneyland. That deal made her stop effective immediately.”</p><p>Agatha snorts. For the hundredth time she’ll ever say it in her head, <em>yep</em>, that’s definitely her child.</p><p>“She stuck with ballet for a few years.” Rio adds. “Even when it got hard. Even when the other girls were mean and she becomes meaner. She’d always practiced in the living room and knocks down the same lamp over and over again.”</p><p>Agatha grins before she can stop herself. “I would’ve paid to see that.”</p><p>“She blamed the cat.” Rio shrugs. “We <em>don’t</em> even have a cat.”</p><p>Agatha laughs, real this time, and it surprises her how nice it actually feels to laugh like that.</p><p>“She doesn’t talk much about it now since she’s grown up and she has learned to love other things more like acting instead of dancing.” Rio tells her. “But sometimes, she still stretches in the mornings like she’s about to go on stage. I guess being a ballerina will always be a part of her.”</p><p>From then on, the conversation slows, but somehow it has become easy. The tension dissipated and the whole world seemed to be block out of sight. They talk more about Rae’s sarcasm, her music taste (she has Olivia Rodrigo’s personal number, apparently), and how she refuses to admit she still binge watches Barbie movies.</p><p>“You raised her well, Rio.” </p><p>“I really tried.”</p><p>“You didn’t just try.” Agatha says as a matter of fact. “I know that. Rae <em>knows</em> that.”</p><p>The words hang between them. Refusing to let another beat of silence pass, Rio clears her throat. “So.. about me.”</p><p>Agatha arches a brow at the sudden change of conversation, but she didn’t point it out. Guess she’s not the only one deflecting. “What about you?”</p><p>“We’ve covered a lot about Rae.” Rio remarks. “But you don’t really know anything about me. Well, other than whatever google told you about my family’s wealth and that I cook.”</p><p>Agatha smirks. “You also flirt aggressively over soup.”</p><p>“Hey!” Rio protests. “You flirted back.”</p><p>“Regrettably.”</p><p>“Liar.”</p><p>Agatha surrenders. “Fine. Tell me something tragic about yourself then. I simply enjoy hearing about that.”</p><p>Rio thinks for a second, as if her answer will be the trajectory of whatever this is. “For starters, I cry during cooking shows.”</p><p>“Why?” Agatha quips. “That <em>is</em> tragic.”</p><p>“And..” Rio adds, ignoring her question. “I have nine functional ovens at home.”</p><p>“Stop.” Agatha deadpans. “And there I thought you collecting food containers was already tragic.”</p><p>“Rae named my most expensive one.” Rio grins proudly. “She calls it ‘<em>Venny</em>.’”</p><p>“That’s an awful name.” For a second, Agatha forgets everything complicated about their situation. </p><p>“You should still be mad at me.” Rio says softly, eyes searching Agatha’s. “Again.. I’m really sorry, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha exhales, leaning back slightly. She tries to figure out how to deal with the conflicting emotions in her chest “Honestly? I don’t think I was mad. Just.. upset. I didn’t like being lied to. I mean, who does?”</p><p>Rio nods slowly. “I get it. I promise I’m going to be honest with you from now on.”</p><p>“From now on?” Agatha repeats, yet again raising an eyebrow.</p><p>Rio shifts awkwardly, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear. “Well, if you want any part in Rae’s life, then that means we have to..” She pauses, fumbling for words.</p><p>Agatha feels the almost-verbal “<em>co-parent</em>” hovering in the air and stops herself from blurting it out. Instead, she offers, “Be friendly to each other?”</p><p>“Yeah. Friendly.” Rio shrugs. “But the decision still rests with Rae. Whatever you want moving forward, it will only happens if she allows it.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t know yet what role she wants in Rae’s life. What she does know is that for now, she’s content to exist in the space she’s allowed without rushing anything.</p><p>“Well, if you ladies aren’t getting too comfortable here.” Wanda sing-songs, their almost-private bubble popping as she sashays over with yet another drink in hand. This time, Agatha’s pretty sure it’s beer. “I’ve been watching you for like.. an hour now. You two are deep in a serious conversation! What’s up?”</p><p>An hour? Neither of them noticed it had been that long.</p><p>“Rio was just telling me about the new infrastructures of Westview.” Agatha lies smoothly.</p><p>“And Agatha’s been telling me all about L.A.” Rio adds, playing along. “Erewhon, right?”</p><p>Agatha fakes a nod. She hasn’t even stepped foot in Erewhon, but points for effort.</p><p>Wanda sets her glass down on the table and loops her arms around both of them, hands slightly damp from condensation. “I’m just so happy to see my two <em>best friends</em> bonding. This is like, healing for me.”</p><p>Rio gently pries the drink away. “Okay, that’s enough alcohol for you, hon.”</p><p>“Don’t silence me in my own haunted house.” Wanda huffs before she wanders off again, probably to overshare with a stranger or grab herself a different beverage.</p><p>Agatha watches her go. “She’s a lot.”</p><p>“She means well.” </p><p>Before Agatha can respond, Jen appears out of nowhere like a summoned demon.</p><p>“AGATHAAAA.” She barrels toward them, swaying like she’s on a boat. Her eyeliner is smudged, her heels are in her hand, and she smells aggressively like tequila. In a span of an hour Agatha left her to be, this is already the state she found herself in?</p><p>“Oh no.” Agatha mutters.</p><p>“There you are.” Jen slurs, dramatically gripping the table for balance. “I have been looking for you everywhere!”</p><p>That’s a lie. She knows exactly where Agatha is after leaving her alone to deal with Rio earlier.</p><p>“How did you got yourself drunk?” Agatha asks in disbelief.</p><p>Instead of answering, Jen’s eyes land on Rio. “Ohhhhhh my God.”</p><p>Rio stiffens. “Hi?”</p><p>Jen leans in way too close. “I know you. You’re the rich girl in town!”</p><p>Rio blinks, surprise by the other woman’s bluntness. “I—thank you?”</p><p>“Forgive my assistant, she gets cuckoo with every sip of tequila and I presumed she must consumed a lot, though I frankly don’t know how.” Agatha explains. “Okay, pack it up, Jenny. We’re leaving.”</p><p>Jen ignores her, her attention fixed on Rio. “Wait.” She gasps loudly upon connecting the dots. “<em>WAIT</em>.”</p><p>She spins back to Agatha in an instant. “This is her. This is the woman. The one with the kid. Or, <em>your</em> kid. Whose kid, whatever! She’s your.. What’s the term again?”</p><p>Agatha chokes, her eyes wide in fear for what her friend might say next. “Jennifer, don’t you dare.”</p><p>Jen snaps her fingers repeatedly, missing every time. “Your.. your.. <em>baby mama</em>!”</p><p>Crickets. More, and more, crickets.</p><p>Rio coughs after a beat. “I’m sorry?”</p><p>Agatha freezes as her brain absolutely short-circuits. <em>Jen really said that out loud. </em>She swears she won't complain if the earth swallows her whole right now.</p><p>“Jen.” Agatha warns, “You are drunk. Whatever’s coming out of your mouth is junk.”</p><p>“No, I am spiritually sober.” Jen says, wobbling to prove a point. “I am also spiritually aware.”</p><p>She points between them casually with her long finger nails. “You had a baby. She raised the baby. Boom! Baby mama.”</p><p>Rio’s face turns <em>crimson</em>. “I don’t think that’s.. is that even a thing?”</p><p>“Noforgivehershe’sjustdrunkdon'tthinkaboutit.” Agatha mumbles quickly as she is already dragging Jen away, one hand firmly wrapped around her wrist, mentally noting it’s officially time to go before her friend says something that will permanently ruin her social standing.</p><p>“We’re leaving!” Agatha calls over her shoulder, voice loud enough to cut through the music.</p><p>“Agatha, wait!” Rio calls, attempting to chase after them but Agatha moves fast in a speed of lightning.</p><p>Jen, unfortunately, was in her villain era. She was blowing kisses at other guest, loudly complimenting a woman’s shoes, and nearly tripping over a decorative plant. </p><p>They are already in the car when Rio reaches the front door, sighing to have missed the chance of a proper goodbye with Agatha.</p><p>“Jen, I am never letting you drink tequila again.” Agatha tells her.</p><p>“Tequila and I are soulmates.” Jen slumps to her seat. “We will find each other again, hey! Maybe I will <em>not</em> end alone for the rest of my life after all.”</p><p>The ride home is a blur of Jen singing off-key and Agatha massaging her temple, but oddly enough, the day doesn’t feel like a total disaster.</p><p>When Jen is passed out on Lilia’s guest bedroom and Agatha is finally alone—her phone buzzes, finally receiving a notification she hasn’t receive for a week.</p><blockquote><p><strong>riovidal: </strong>i wasn't able to say goodbye earlier</p><p><strong>riovidal:</strong> i really hope your friend's okay</p><p><b>agathaharkness:</b> She’s knocked out.                                        </p><p><b>agathaharkness:</b> I should be the one apologizing for what she said, clearly she’s lost her mind.                                                 </p><p><b>riovidal:</b> haha, no worries                                                                                                                  </p><p><b>riovidal: </b>i’m just glad we got to talk today, and i’m really thankful you gave me a chance to say things i wasn’t able to say before                                                                                                                                                          </p><p><b>riovidal: </b>also, it’s a win since i got to spend time with my baby mama!!!                                                            </p><p><strong>riovidal</strong><b>: </b>in our case it works either way, right?</p></blockquote><p>Agatha breathes through her nose, a smile she refuses to acknowledge tugging at her lips.</p><blockquote><p><b>agathaharkness:</b> You are never letting that go, are you?</p></blockquote><p>Three dots appear almost instantly.</p><blockquote><p><b>riovidal: </b>absolutely not                                                                                                                                                                                      </p><p><b>riovidal:</b> i’ve waited my whole life for this title</p></blockquote><p>Agatha snorts, shaking her head.</p><blockquote><p><b>agathaharkness:</b> I hate you.</p><p><b>riovidal: </b>you don’t<br/><b></b></p><p><b>riovidal:</b> goodnight, agatha :)</p></blockquote><p>Agatha smiles, unguarded.</p><p>She tells herself it’s just because it’s funny.</p><p>Definitely not because it’s <em>Rio</em>.</p>

<p>Lilia claps her hands in a commanding way she always does before class officially starts. Agatha swears she’s Pavlov-trained these kids because the second that beat echoes through the room, they scramble back to their seats like obedient theatre soldiers. </p><p>“Alright, young actors.” Lilia announces, “Today, we’re doing object transformation.”</p><p>Agatha grins from her spot. <em>Oh, this is going to be good. </em></p><p>This is the kind of exercise that exposes the ones who commit way too hard and the ones who freeze like deer in headlights. She can already picture the chaos with kids gripping random junk while desperately trying to convince everyone it’s something else entirely.</p><p>“You’ll each choose a random object of your liking.” Lilia explains, pacing slowly in front of the group. “And your job is to turn it into something else. Please refrain from giving me a boring mime, I don’t want to see you pretending. I want to believe you, you have to make me believe you.”</p><p>She stops beside a kid in the center aisle. “If you turn a shoe into a phone, I want to see your whole life inside that call. Who are you talking to? Why are you calling them? What happens if they don’t pick up? What’s at stake?”</p><p>She spreads her arms dramatically for added effect. “Is it heartbreak? Is it hope? Is it an <em>I know what you did last summer</em> sort of confession? Are you calling the one person you swore you’d never speak to again? Live in it. Breathe it. Show me how it's done.”</p><p>A few kids buzz in excitement. Someone already looks stressed, someone else smirking while glancing at its watch with probably a few ideas floating in its head at that exact moment.</p><p>“Commit.” Lilia tells them with gritted teeth. “I don’t care if it’s messy or ridiculous. I don’t care if it makes you look stupid. I only care that it’s honest.”</p><p>Agatha watches from the sidelines, amused. She can’t wait to witness these kids allow their imagination collide with fear and instinct. </p><p>Subconsciously, she glances at Rae’s usual seat.<em> It’s empty</em>.That’s when it dawned to her.. Rae isn’t here today.</p><p>She straightens in her chair, scanning the room like she might’ve missed something obvious. Maybe Rae moved to the back, though she knows better. There is absolutely <em>no</em> universe where Rae would willingly choose the back row. That kid lives for being seen.</p><p>Agatha counts faces again but even then, there’s no Rae in sight.</p><p>That’s.. strange. Rae seems to be the type that doesn’t miss class. She treats the workshop like it’s her personal church, clinging to it as if it’s a religion. She’s always the first to volunteer, the first to argue, and the first to roll her eyes.</p><p>On top of that, she excels the most. She adjusts her performance the moment feedback is given, as if learning comes to her the way breathing does. Her absence speaks volume.. or is Agatha biased of her own kid?</p><p>“Hey.” Agatha leans in casually when Lilia sits back beside her, trying not to make it obvious that she might be spiraling. “I don’t see Rae anywhere. Did she say she wasn’t coming today?”</p><p>Lilia frowns, following Agatha’s gaze. “Right? That kid would’ve jumped up to go first.” She mutters. “I didn’t get a heads-up or anything, but I’ll make sure to ask Kate to contact her later.”</p><p>Later feels too <em>far </em>away.</p><p>Agatha forces a nods, but her stomach is already tying itself into knots. She’s trying not to jump into conclusions or assume the worst, God forbid something happened.</p><p>Before she can overthink it further, she pulls out her phone and opens Instagram. Her fingers hover for a second before she taps Rio’s profile, then sends a short message with her number and a vague “<em>call me.”</em></p><p>Not even two minutes pass when her phone vibrates so she makes her way out of the room before answering the call, paying no attention to the ongoing activity.</p><p>Sorry, kids. Mentor Agatha—<em>Mommy</em> Agatha has personal business to attend to. Your make believe objects can wait.</p><p>“<em>Agatha?</em>” Rio says from the other line. “<em>What’s wrong?</em>”</p><p>“Rae didn’t come to class today.” Agatha blurts. “Where is she?”</p><p>There’s a brief pause on the other end, long enough for Agatha’s brain to feed itself with the worst case scenarios. “<em>Really</em>?” Rio asks. “<em>I told her to inform one of the adults in the workshop, she must have forgotten.</em>”</p><p>Agatha’s heart is racing. “Is something wrong? Is she sick?”</p><p>“<em>No,</em> <em>she flew to Hawaii with my mom.</em>”</p><p>“Hawaii?” Agatha repeats, stunned.</p><p>“<em>Yeah. My mom has this yearly get-together with her friends, and she insists Rae tags along every time. They’ll be gone for the weekend.</em>”</p><p>Only then does Agatha realize she’s been holding her breath the entire time. She lets it out slowly, tension draining from her shoulders. “Oh.”</p><p>“<em>Sorry.</em>” Rio adds gently. “<em>I should’ve followed up and made sure she told someone.</em>”</p><p>“It’s fine.” Agatha dismisses her. “I was just—” She stops herself from saying the word <em>worried</em>. </p><p>She doesn't want to overstep and claim something she technically has <em>no </em>right to. So instead, she shrugs even though Rio can’t see it. “I just <em>noticed </em>she isn’t here.” </p><p>Agatha tries to hide the part where her chest dropped the second she saw that empty chair. For one awful second, her mind went everywhere it shouldn’t, and she doesn’t like it.</p><p>Maybe that’s just what it means to <em>care</em>. Give it to Agatha who holds a bachelor’s degree in the art of deflection. She pushes the thought aside before it can settle and consume her any further.</p><p>“<em>Well..</em>” Agatha can hear shuffling movement from the other line. “<em>Rae is very much alive. We were texting an hour ago. Right now, she’s probably bossing her abuela over piña colata.</em>”</p><p>“Yeah. That tracks.” She leans against the hallway wall, phone pressed to her ear. “Thanks for calling me back.” She adds reverently.</p><p>“<em>Anytime.”</em></p><p>There’s a beat of silence after that, long enough Agatha presumes Rio must have already hung up. “<em>You know..</em>” She murmurs eventually, voice careful, “<em>Yelena Belova is performing in town tonight.</em>”</p><p>“Who?” Agatha asks, brows knitting together.</p><p>“<em>Yelena.</em>” Rio repeats her name with distinct pronunciation, as if that alone should clear everything up. “<em>The singer? She went viral a while back. She used to live in her car before people discovered her online, she’s kind of a big deal now.</em>”</p><p>“I genuinely have no idea who you’re talking about.”</p><p>Rio lets out a small laugh. <em>“Okay, that’s fair.” </em>Then she adds, almost like an afterthought, “<em>I could take you so you’d have an idea who I’m talking about.”</em></p><p>Agatha was taken aback. She considers the bad timing and impending terrible circumstances. She doesn’t know if it’s a <em>good </em>idea to go out with Rio, especially with everything hanging over them like a storm cloud.</p><p>“Would that even be okay?” Agatha asks slowly.</p><p>“<em>Mhm?</em>” </p><p>“Would you.. taking me out,” Agatha clarifies, choosing her words carefully, “Would that be a good idea? I mean, with Rae and everything going on.”</p><p>Rio goes quiet, clearly thinking it through. <em>“Right.” </em>She finally admits. “<em>It’s complicated.</em>”</p><p>Agatha nods because, of course it is. Nothing in her life gets to be simple anymore. Everything is complicated the way the universe intended it to be.</p><p>Maybe that’s the price she has to pay.</p><p>“<em>I don’t want to confuse her.</em>” Rio continues. <em>“Rae already has enough on her plate with meeting you and all. I don’t want to add more pressure.</em>”</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha agrees. “She already hates me on a good day. I don’t want to give her additional reasons to hate me even more, if that’s even possible..”</p><p>“<em>She doesn’t hate you.</em>”</p><p>“Be with us in a room for three minutes and say that again to my face.”</p><p><em>“Do you want me to talk to her?”</em></p><p>“Please don’t.”</p><p>Rio hums a small <em>okay </em>before changing the subject. <em>“For starters,</em> <em>I didn’t mean it like a date.</em>” She clarifies. “<em>Not really. I just thought we could go as two adults who simply know each other.</em>”</p><p><em>Simply</em>? More like simply complicated. </p><p>“Wow.” Agatha says dryly. “That’s such a romantic pitch.”</p><p>“<em>That wasn’t the goal</em>.” Rio huffs a quiet laugh. “<em>We don’t have to label it.</em>”</p><p>“I really don’t want to hurt her.” Agatha lets her vulnerability slip slightly. “I already feel like I’m walking on glass.”</p><p>“<em>I know.</em>” Rio replies kindly. “<em>Me too. That’s why I asked instead of assuming.</em>”</p><p>Agatha should say no. She knows she should, but she’s tired of always choosing the safe option when everything else in her says otherwise.</p><p>“What time?” </p><p>“<em>Eight. Small venue downtown.</em>” </p><p>“Figures.” Agatha mutters. “You hate fancy places as if you don’t already live in one. Or is it six? Be honest.”</p><p><em>“Not true!”</em> Rio protests mildly. “<em>I do not own six houses, Agatha. That’s absurd.</em>”</p><p>“Yeah, it’s ‘cause you probably own seven.” Agatha smiles to herself when she hears Rio groaning. “Send me the address and to be clear, this is not a date, no?”</p><p>“<em>Yup</em>. <em>Definitely not a date.</em>” Rio must be grinning from the other line.</p><p>They hang up. Agatha tells herself it won’t be <em>that </em>bad if it’s not a date because it <em>won’t </em>mean anything. There will be no lines crossed. <em>Hopefully</em>, considering Agatha’s record of flirting shamelessly.</p><p>Anyway, what harm could a stroll downtown do, with some singer she’d never even heard of humming in the background? </p><p>That’s fine. She’s fine. <em>They’ll be fine.</em> She pockets her phone and sighs. <em>“It’s not a date, Agatha. You’ll be fine.”</em></p><p>In true Agatha fashion when she has to involve herself in the doings of the public, she shows up looking like a member of a secret spy agency. Cap pulled low, tinted sunglasses on.. at night. There's no sun in sight but frankly, she has zero shame.</p><p>Her get up doesn't allow her to be 100% incognito, but it helps. People still stare and she lets them. Fame is weird like that. Sometimes you avoid it, sometimes you lean into it just to feel something. Tonight, she’s doing both.</p><p>Rio is already there when Agatha arrives, she's leaning against the streetlamp with her hands in the pocket of her jeans. Agatha stops dead in her tracks when she notices the actual <em>crime</em>.</p><p>They’re both wearing long sleeve polos in the <em>same</em> color. It is in different shades of blue, sure, but still. </p><p>Rio has hers tucked casually into jeans, sleeves slightly rolled up. Agatha on the other hand paired hers with a long white skirt, allowing the fabric to flow freely with the breeze of the air.</p><p>“Are you fucking kidding me?” Agatha hisses in disbelief, lifting her sunglasses just enough to glare.</p><p>Rio looks at her up and down, tongue pressing against her cheek in a way that somehow feels like flirting even when she would swear it isn’t. “Damn. The universe really hates us.”</p><p>“This is not funny.” Agatha declares. “We look coordinated.”</p><p>“The funniest part..” Rio adds, dead serious, “Is this was not intentional.”</p><p>Agatha waves a hand at Rio’s entire fit. “You have to change.”</p><p>Rio blinks. “Why?”</p><p>“Because I don’t want to be seen matching outfits with you.”</p><p>“Yes, but not more than I do.”</p><p>“<em>Rio</em>.”</p><p>Rio crosses her arms, amusement clear on her face like she's enjoying this entire ordeal. “Okay, why do <em>I</em> have to change? Why don’t <em>you</em> change?”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to think of an excuse or a rebuttal. When she can't think of any to justify her pettiness, she sighs in defeat. It would really be unfair to make the other woman change.. “Whatever, just don’t walk too close to me.”</p><p>She knows that two people wearing the same outfit and walking too close at night is the kind of thing that makes strangers assume they’re a couple. Isn’t that what ordinary couples do nowadays? They coordinate aesthetics by committing to one color palette.</p><p>She absolutely does <em>not</em> want that kind of impression.</p><p>“Sure.” Rio smirks. “<em>M’lady</em>.”</p><p>They start walking, although not quite shoulder to shoulder. They’re close enough to share the same path but far enough to keep a careful distance, blending into the noisy crowd of downtown. </p><p>With every loud music spilling from open bars and food stands with their bright neon signs, Agatha feels like she belongs here. Or maybe it’s just nostalgia messing up with her mind.</p><p>Still, as much as she hates the town, she can’t deny the comfort it offers her now. In its own roundabout way, it’s the place that shaped her into who she is today.</p><p>The singer won’t be performing until later so Rio brings her to a small birriería tucked between a laundromat and a closed tattoo shop. It looks like it might disappear if you blink too long.</p><p>“This place..” Rio points, her eyes almost glinting. “Absolutely changed my life.”</p><p>Agatha squints at it. “It looks like it might give me food poisoning.”</p><p>“Trust me.” Rio insists, chuckling. “I would never betray you with bad birria.”</p><p>“That’s a strong promise.”</p><p>They entered the shop and step up to the counter. The guy working there grins at Rio, clearly recognizing her.</p><p>“<em>¡Rio!</em>” He calls. “You finally brought your <em>novia</em>!”</p><p>Agatha chokes on absolutely nothing. She doesn’t speak Spanish, but from the scraps she picked up in Señora Alma’s class at least two decades ago, she’s fairly certain she knows what <em>novia </em>means. “Excuse me?”</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen in panic. “No, no! We're not—”</p><p>The guy cuts her off, pointing between them. “Matching fits? Come on. That’s ultimate couple behavior.”</p><p>Agatha looks down at her polo, her own choices from earlier betraying her now. “I would like to formally state I did not consent to this.”</p><p>Rio laughs nervously, nodding in agreement. “We dressed similarly in pure accident.”</p><p>“Uh-huh.” The guy smirks. “Accidentally in love too?”</p><p><em>In love?</em> With her? The woman who raised her kid?</p><p>For some reason, that idea made Agatha’s brain forget how to use its respiratory function. To add salt to the injury, her heart is doing that stupid thing where it thumps too loud, clearly demanding for attention. </p><p><em>Please shut up,</em> she tries to shut it off. <em>This is not the time to deal with feelings.</em></p><p>Agatha turns to Rio. Rio is laughing, but she looks embarrassed. Her cheeks are a little pink, and Agatha hates how she noticed that detail.</p><p>“I do not like him.”</p><p>Rio hides her face with her hand. “He’s like this with everyone.”</p><p>“I’m not.” The guy insists, obviously eavesdropping. “I’m only like this to cute couples.”</p><p>Agatha leans in this time, whispering to Rio once again. “If he asks us to share a birria, let it be known I’m leaving.”</p><p>The guy grins wider, thriving in their situation. He has such excellent auditory skills to have heard what Agatha said. “Two orders of birria for the lovebirds, then.”</p><p>“Stop calling us that!” They protest <em>simultaneously, </em>which only makes it worse.</p><p>That became his avenue for teasing them even more. “Relax. Just enjoy the food and maybe you’ll <em>kiss</em> after.”</p><p>Agatha can feel her own cheeks burning. At this point, her soul is actually leaving her body. “We will not.”</p><p>Rio nods awkwardly. “We really won’t.”</p><p>It’s funny when before she knew Rio was Rae’s mother, Agatha had been whining about <em>only </em>getting a hug from her. Now, the very thought of getting a kiss from Rio is enough to make her stomach do cartwheels.</p><p>They move away from the counter and find an empty spot to sit nearby. Agatha crosses her legs, pretending she’s very invested in adjusting her skirt when really she’s replaying the guy’s <em>lovebirds</em> and <em>kiss </em>comment in her head like a cursed voicemail she can’t delete.</p><p>She clears her throat loudly, the universal sound of <em>I am changing the subject immediately.</em></p><p>“So..” She says too fast. “How exactly do you know about this place?”</p><p>Rio was caught off guard by the abrupt shift. “Uh—I guess I enjoyed wandering around to discover hidden little spots to eat. I also pickup tips and notes whenever I could back when I was just learning the ropes in culinary school. A senior once told me that if the menu looks questionable, the food’s probably amazing. I’ve carried that with me ever since.”</p><p>Agatha nods way too seriously. “I agree. If the health inspector fears it, expect the flavor to be immaculate.”</p><p>Rio chuckles. “Pretty much.”</p><p>Agatha keeps going, because stopping would mean thinking, and thinking would mean remembering the unsolicited comments that involves mistaking them for being a couple. “You bring Rae here too?”</p><p>“Yep. She pretends she’s too cool for it but she always steals my food.” Rio smiles, and something stirs in Agatha’s chest.</p><p>She quickly remind herself that this isn’t a date and she’s far too smart to let a simple smile make her feel anything.</p><p>The birrias arrive, and thankfully, the server wasn’t the guy from earlier. Rio watches as Agatha takes her first bite, and Agatha nearly forgets her own name by how spectacular it is, proving Rio absolutely right.</p><p>She takes another bite, letting the flavors ground her in the present. She ignores the flutter in her chest whenever Rio looks at her. Instead, she settles on the fleeting sense of calm the food and the company has brought her.</p><p>They finish their meal slower than expected, grease-stained napkins piling up between them. Rio jokes that it’s the evidence of a very good decision, and Agatha halfheartedly agrees.</p><p>When they leave the place and start walking again, Agatha takes the lead without explaining, cutting through quieter streets and up toward the side of town where the voices thins and the air feels a little less crowded.</p><p>Rio notices the change. “You’re walking like someone with a plan.” She notes. “Should I be concerned?”</p><p>“I’m not leading you to the forest. This isn’t a true crime podcast.”</p><p>“That’s exactly what someone in a true crime podcast would say.”</p><p>Agatha grins over her shoulder. “Please. If I were going to commit a crime, it’d be something related to a mass scamming. Homicide is a little <em>too</em> bloody for my liking.”</p><p>They stop when a particular structure comes into view. Before them stood a large, slightly weathered public telescope mounted on a concrete platform, pointed toward the sky like it’s been waiting patiently for someone to remember it exists.</p><p>Despite the years that had gone, Agatha will always remember its existence even if most people in Westview don’t.</p><p>Her expression softens in a way she doesn’t even try to hide. “It’s been here since I was a kid.” She tells Rio. “I used to sneak out just to come up here. I liked pretending I was doing something profound with my life, it’s a NASA dream of mine. ”</p><p>Rio steps closer, eyes roaming over the telescope, the platform, and the faint plaque no one ever reads. She observes first before making a statement.</p><p>“You’re in Westview’s most under appreciated landmark.” Agatha insists. “Don’t tell me you’ve never been here?”</p><p>“Never.” Rio admits, almost sheepish. “I’ve heard of it. People talk about it like it’s a myth, but I never came up here.”</p><p>“Ah, yes.” Agatha raises an eyebrow. “Tonight we have the wealthy cultured, well-traveled, and yet tragically deprived of small town astronomy—Rio Vidal.”</p><p>“I feel judged.”</p><p>“You should.”</p><p>Agatha moves to the telescope and adjusts it with practiced ease. The muscle memory kicks in before thought as she gestures grandly, “Behold, the moon!”</p><p>Rio leans down and peers through the lens curiously. “I don’t see anything.”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “You didn’t even try.”</p><p>“I absolutely did. I saw.. darkness, and maybe my own disappointment.”</p><p>“You have to adjust it.” Agatha instructs, stepping closer. “Here. Try again.”</p><p>Rio bends down once more, eyes squinting. “Still nothing. Is it broken?”</p><p>“It’s not broken.” Agatha says patiently. “You just—hold on.”</p><p>She reaches out instinctively, hands landing on Rio’s hips to gently guide her forward. It’s meant to be practical, except the second her hands make contact only did she realized what she has done.</p><p><em>Oh</em>. That’s a body. A very real body. <em>Rio’s </em>warm body.</p><p>No lines crossed, right? Then why the fuck is she making a move by holding—</p><p>She feels Rio stiffen in her touch for half a second, then relaxes. “Am I in the right place now?”</p><p>“Shhh,” Agatha shushes her, not wanting to entertain the elephant in the room. “You weren’t, but you are now.”</p><p>She steps closer, standing just behind Rio now, adjusting her stance with small, careful movements. One hand stays at Rio’s waist, the other briefly brushing her side as she angles her toward the lens.</p><p>Agatha becomes painfully aware of how close they are, of how easily she could rest her chin on Rio’s shoulder, and of how this is absolutely <em>not </em>something she should be thinking about.</p><p>She tells herself to get it together and redirect her focus on her real goal. Honestly, she deserves a standing ovation from NASA for this.</p><p>“Okay.” Agatha announces after a minute, satisfied with their position. “Now look.”</p><p>Rio places a hand on the top of the telescope. She adjusts her view, then gasps. “Oh! I see it. I actually see it!”</p><p>“Told you so.”</p><p>“It’s really clear from here!” Rio exclaims. “I didn’t think it’d look like that. Bigger, I mean..”</p><p>“Yeah. It always does that. It makes you feel small in a good way.” </p><p>Rio glances back at her, their faces suddenly much closer than intended. “You came up here a lot?”</p><p>Agatha feels conscious of the space so she finally removes her grip from Rio, taking a step backward. “I come here whenever I needed reminding that the world was bigger than my problems.” She says, then quickly regrets the vulnerability. “Or when I needed dramatic lighting for an existential crisis.”</p><p>Rio laughs. “I like that.”</p><p>“I’ve always been drawn to the moon.” Agatha adds. “There’s something honest about the way it hangs there in solitude. It’s always been there, its beauty so often overlooked since it appears while most of the world is asleep, and gone again by the time they wake, as if it never waited at all.”</p><p>Rio looks at her in quiet awe, listening to every careful word. “I guess.” She says after a moment, thoughtful. “But the sun isn’t so bad either. I like to think its job is to takeover when the moon needs to rest.”</p><p>Agatha catches herself looking at Rio—the way her eyes light up when she talks, the way the glow skims across her face. She’s beautiful like this.. <em>no</em>. She shuts that thought down immediately.</p><p>She blames the night sky and the telescope for creating such raw moment between them.</p><p>She crosses her arms, deflecting as usual. “Anyway. Big rock, very impressive. We should probably—”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio interrupts, gentle but sincere. “For bringing me here.”</p><p>Agatha pauses, then shrugs. “Well, everyone deserves to see the moon properly at least once.”</p><p><em>Even if it means standing too close and pretending it didn’t mean anything.</em></p><p>They drift back down toward town proper as the night thickens. Loud music leaks into the streets before the crowd does. The venue is already full of people clustered like moths around warm light. Agatha keeps her cap low again, sunglasses still on because commitment to the bit matters.</p><p>They don’t even make it ten steps into the crowd before Agatha feels it, that familiar prickle at the back of her neck. “Agatha? Is that you?” Kate walks up to her, drink in hand.</p><p>“Oh no.” Rio whispers beside her. “Friend?”</p><p>“More like threat to my peace.”</p><p>Kate is already in front of them, eyes bright with recognition. “I knew that was you. I’d recognize that posture anywhere. You walk like you’re trying not to be perceived.”</p><p>Agatha pinches the bridge of her nose. “This is not happening.”</p><p>Kate squints past her then, finally clocking Rio hovering a polite step away. “Hello. And you are?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha warns firmly, stepping half an inch to block the view. “You don’t know her. She doesn’t know you. Let’s leave it at that.”</p><p>Agatha has no idea why Kate is even in town on the exact same night she is. Lilia once mentioned her assistant is heaven sent since she preferred staying home and avoiding crowds like she does so this is a surprise to her. She doesn’t ask about the woman's business, tho.</p><p>Frankly, she’s not interested in Kate’s life and whatever she does outside of work.</p><p>Kate lifts her hands in surrender, fully aware of how terrifying Agatha can get. “Okay, sorry for approaching you. You may now lurk, or whatever this is.” She gives a sloppy salute with her cup and wanders off, already distracted by someone else</p><p>Agatha turns back to Rio, who is now openly grinning at her. “You know she’s getting the wrong impression of us, right?”</p><p>“Probably.” Agatha shrugs. “But I know she’ll keep her mouth shut.”</p><p>They slip into the crowd just as the lights dim. A hush rolls over the space, followed by cheers as Yelena Belova finally reveals herself. There’s a spotlight while she holds a mic in hand, stepping into the middle of the stage.</p><p><em>It's a human sign</em></p><p><em>When things go wrong</em></p><p>Agatha feels it immediately. <em>That </em>pull. That quiet ache she pretends not to have.</p><p>When the first notes of <em>Cold Heart</em> fill the air, the crowd stills. Yelena’s voice is raw. Every syllable laid bare, as if she sings directly to you. </p><p><em>When the scent of her lingers</em></p><p><em>And temptation's strong</em></p><p>She risks a glance at Rio. Rio’s watching the stage, but there’s something else there too. Maybe Agatha is in a high, or maybe Rio feels it <em>too</em>. Maybe the song is pressing on the same bruise on two different people.</p><p>“She’s good.” Rio murmurs without looking at her.</p><p>“Yeah.” Agatha diverts her gaze. “She is.”</p><p><em>Cold, cold heart</em></p><p><em>Hardened by you</em></p><p>Agatha feels the words land far too close to home, and suddenly she’s aware of everything. What is she even doing?</p><p>When did she convince herself that this wasn’t a date, that walking through town with Rio under borrowed moments was somehow harmless? Why did she agree to this at all, knowing how fragile her footing with Rae already is, knowing one wrong step could push her even farther away?</p><p>And worse, why does her heart <em>refuse</em> to listen?</p><p><em>Some things looking better, baby</em></p><p><em>Just passing through</em></p><p>Her mind lays it out cleanly. If she stands by logic, she’d know how complicated and selfish this is. On top of that, she’s standing on dangerous territory.</p><p>But her chest aches in a way even logic can’t explain, thrumming with something unknown. It is both reckless and <em>painfully </em>alive. She hates that part of herself for feeling that way, for wanting something she knows she couldn’t reach for.</p><p>Shouldn’t reach for. <em>Must</em> not reach for.</p><p><em>And I think it's gonna be a long, long time</em></p><p><em>'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find</em></p><p>So why, standing here with Rio, does <em>wanting</em> feel inevitable?</p><p>She’s only known this woman for what, less than a month? Why does she keep finding herself drawn to her anyway? And if it’s wrong, why does it feel easy?</p><p>Agatha has had her fair share of women. May it be flings or brief distractions, nothing ever lingered long enough to make an impression. Nothing ever made her feel exposed, nothing ever made her question her feelings the way Rio does now. </p><p>It’s confusing and terrifying all at once, and she hates that she can’t push it away.</p><p><em>I'm not the man they think I am at home</em></p><p><em>Oh, no, no, no</em></p><p>She shifts, suddenly aware of how near Rio is. Their arms brush. This time, neither of them moves away. A shiver runs down her spine, the hairs at the back of her neck standing on end.</p><p>“You okay?” Rio asks.</p><p>Agatha nods, focusing on the stage and the singer entirely. “She makes me feel things.”</p><p>“That’s her whole brand.”</p><p><em>And this is what I should have said</em></p><p><em>Well, I thought it but I kept it hid</em></p><p>The rest of the crowd blends into a distant hum. </p><p>At some point, Rio’s hand grazes against Agatha’s, lingering just a fraction longer than expected. It doesn’t do anything. It’s just.. <em>there</em>.</p><p>Something in that simple touch makes Agatha’s heart skip. Fingers tentative at first, then slowly settling, as if they’ve always been meant to fit together. Before she realizes it, Agatha finds herself intertwining her fingers with Rio’s, holding on a little tighter than she intended, and feeling a warmth bloom through her chest that has nothing to do with the weather.</p><p>Agatha’s brain immediately starts screaming at herself for what she did. Don’t panic. This is fine. People hold hands. Friends hold hands. <em>Do they?</em> God, do they?</p><p>Rio doesn’t point out their hands. She doesn’t comment on their touch either. She lets it be, as if it’s the most natural thing in the world and somehow, that makes it even harder for Agatha to think clearly, harder to pretend this isn’t exactly where she <em>wants</em> to be.</p><p><em>Cold, cold heart</em></p><p><em>Hardened by you</em></p><p>Rio squeezes her hand once, firm but gentle, and it grounds Agatha. She looks up at Rio, catching her warm smile.</p><p>They settle into shared silence, though Agatha’s feels her lips twitch into a smile anyway, copying Rio’s. Against better judgment, she lets herself sink into the moment, letting everything else fade into the background. </p><p>Their fingers remain intertwined in a kind of quiet promise neither of them fully understand yet.</p><p><em>Something's looking better, baby</em></p><p><em>Just passing through</em></p><p>They stand there, swaying lightly with the rhythm of the lingering music every now and then. Yelena's performance ends eventually as the crowd erupts with applause.</p><p><em>Not </em>a date, Agatha reminds herself. Definitely not a date.</p><p>And yet, she doesn’t let go of Rio’s hand. She doesn’t <em>want </em>to.</p><blockquote><p><b>Agatha:</b> Hey, it’s Agatha.</p><p><b>Rio: </b>i already have your number saved </p><p><b>Rio: </b>also, heyyyy</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> That feels alarmingly fast.</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> Might’ve given you my contact way too soon.</p><p><b>Rio:</b> i promise you won’t regret it</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Well then, thanks for tonight.</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>I actually enjoyed it.</p><p><b>Rio</b>: you’re welcome and thank you for taking me to see the moon, that was really cool</p><p><b>Rio: </b>i’ll take this as a personal achievement</p><p><b>Rio:</b> also, we should sleep. it’s getting really late</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Sure, grandma. Want me to tuck you in too?</p><p><b>Rio: </b>watch it!!</p><p><b>Rio:</b> i’m a woman of habit, not decay</p><p><b>Agatha: </b>Tomato, tomato.</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> Good night, Rio.</p><p><b>Rio: </b>good night, agatha</p><p><b>Rio:</b> pls don’t ghost me for six months.</p><p><b>Agatha:</b> No promises.</p></blockquote><p>The next morning, Agatha comes downstairs later than usual, hair still damp from the shower. She carries a mug that’s warming her hands. </p><p>Lilia and Kate are already at the breakfast nook with their plates half-full. They’ve obviously been awake longer than she is. With Jen flying back to LA the day prior, the house is back down to its three occupants.</p><p>“Good morning!” </p><p>Lilia looks up from her book and studies her with suspicious gaze. “You’re particularly chirpy this morning.” She comments. “And you don’t look like you regret waking up, why is that?”</p><p>“I woke up breathing, figured I might as well continue the trend.” Agatha hums, slipping into the extra chair while taking a sip of her coffee.</p><p>“Did something nice happen last night?” Lilia asks not in an accusing or teasing way. Just observant. </p><p>Agatha pauses, mug hovering near her mouth. “That’s a loaded question.”</p><p>“I didn’t mean it that way.” Lilia clarifies. “I just meant that if something good happened, you don’t have to pretend it didn’t.”</p><p>Agatha’s forehead creases. “It wasn’t a date.”</p><p>Kate makes a noise that is absolutely a laugh disguised as a cough. Agatha almost forgot about her, so shoots her a meaningful glare. “It wasn’t.”</p><p>“I didn’t say it was.” Lilia utters calmly. “I just asked if you enjoyed yourself.”</p><p>Agatha finally nods, slow and reluctant without giving anything. “I did. It was fine.”</p><p>Lilia doesn’t have to know the details of her complicated relationship with Rio. Not now, at least.</p><p>“Fine usually doesn’t make you smile before noon.”</p><p>Agatha sets her mug down. “Am I being interrogated, or is this just mandatory breakfast conversation?”</p><p>Lilia sighs, not new to Agatha's way of deflecting a topic. “Just checking in.”</p><p>A beat passes, then Lilia speaks again. “Actually, speaking of checking in, I was thinking of doing something for the kids once the workshop wraps.”</p><p>Agatha looks up. “Mhmm?”</p><p>The workshop won’t end for another few weeks but when it does, it means she’ll be headed back to LA. There’s really nothing left for her to do here in Westview. She has no obligations left or excuses to linger on.</p><p>And with that comes the weight of reality, she only has a few weeks to figure out what she <em>wants</em> to do with Rae. How to be in her life, how to navigate something she’s never faced before. The clock is ticking, and every moment feels heavier than the last.</p><p>She forces herself to redirect her thoughts, pushing the weight of the looming decisions to the back of her mind. For now, she clings to a simpler, almost fragile idea that when Rae returns from Hawaii, she’ll actually talk to her. <em>Genuinely</em>, without the usual bickering and verbal assassinations.</p><p>For now, that’s enough hope to hold onto until she has to face the rest.</p><p>“I usually treat them to dinner.” Lilia continues. “Nothing fancy. Just somewhere they can eat too much and feel celebrated. Do you know any catering services around here? Or someone local we could trust?”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers tighten slightly around her mug.</p><p>Catering service? Food? Agatha’s mind immediately drifts to the only name that comes to mind. It’s almost laughable how quickly her thoughts leap there, but then again, some things are hard to ignore.</p><p>“I might, actually.” </p><p>“Tell me more.”</p><p>Agatha nods. “Rae’s—” She stops herself, then recalibrates. “Rae’s mami is a chef.”</p><p>Lilia watches her with interest. “Is she good?”</p><p>“The first night we were here, when we saw Rae working at that Puerto Rican restaurant—”</p><p>“Yes, you were very rude to young Rae,” Lilia interrupts, clenching her teeth.</p><p>“Not my point.” Agatha rolls her eyes. “Anyway, I found out they actually own that place. Or well, Rae’s mami does.”</p><p>“I’ve always known that kid is loaded!” Kate exclaims. “One time, I commented on the Van Cleef she was wearing, and she offered to give it to me. I declined out of moral compass, of course.”</p><p>“How’d you even know that?” Lilia asks, barely following Kate’s tangent. “How do you know her mom?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs, keeping it casual. “She’s just a friend I coincidentally met recently.”</p><p>Lilia eyes her suspiciously but doesn’t press any longer. “Do you think she can handle the dinner?”</p><p>“I can ask.” </p><p>She quickly texts Rio about it, and the reply comes almost instantly.</p><blockquote><p><b>Rio: </b>sure </p><p><b>Rio: </b>anything for my baby mama 🩷</p></blockquote><p><em>Such a fucking idiot,</em> she thinks—but she smiles anyway.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>The workshop is located on the first floor of a building Lilia rented along one of Westview’s busier streets. It isn’t big, but it’s wide enough to carve out a space where parents can lounge if they choose to stay for the entirety of the three-hour class, a concept Agatha has learned is less optional than it sounds.</p><p>Some helicopter parents, for example, treat the place like a long-term waiting room. </p><p>Gavin’s mom stays throughout, firmly convinced her youngest couldn’t survive without supervision, despite evidence to the contrary. Paisley’s mom remains for different reasons. She’s constantly hovering and doting, as if her daughter might suddenly require emergency lip balm in a moment’s notice.</p><p>That’s one of the reasons why, before she ever knew Rio, Agatha found it suspicious that Rae’s parent never stayed during the workshops. Maybe it was because Rae was on the older side and is one independent kid. Maybe because Rio is often too busy. Either way, she can always just ask Rio about it if she’s <em>so</em> curious with this whole ordeal.</p><p>Today, Rio is finally visiting the workshop. Lilia invites her over to discuss logistics such as menus, allergies, and all the boring adult stuff Agatha would probably not listen to.</p><p>She, however, feels oddly responsible. So she waits by the entrance when Rio texts that she’s pulling over, playing the role of a welcoming host that she pretends to be.</p><p>Rio shows up in a black long sleeves cropped tee, a teasing sliver of toned stomach on display which is probably enough to distract Agatha’s entire focus for the day.</p><p>Agatha tries not to look because looking is disrespectful and wrong. It takes her a good ten seconds before she peeks again, ever so casually. <em>Damn it.</em> Who is she kidding? Eyes are after all, made for seeing.</p><p>“Hi.” Rio greets, adjusting her basketball cap, completely oblivious to her impact on Agatha’s already mushy brain. “I’m not too late, am I?”</p><p>“You’re just in time, actually. Class doesn’t start for another hour, but of course you know that.” Agatha replies, stepping forward as Rio follows her inside. “I hope we’re not pulling you away from something important.”</p><p>“Not at all. My sous chefs can handle a few hours without me.” Rio says easily. “So this is what Rae’s been gushing about..”</p><p>Her voice lowers as she takes in the space, admiring the setup Lilia’s team somehow managed to pull together. Posters line the hallway walls with glossy stills of Agatha’s films and Lilia’s projects. Some frames contains award photos frozen in time.</p><p>Rio stops in front of one poster in particular. The title reads: <em>Afternoon Delight.</em></p><p>“That’s the first movie I ever saw you in.”</p><p>Agatha feels heat creep up her neck but she keeps her composure steady. “Which means you’ve seen me having pretend sex with a man.”</p><p>Rio laughs, a little guilty. “I believe I have.”</p><p>“And you’ve seen my butt.” Agatha adds</p><p>“You don’t have to be embarrassed. It’s a cute butt.” Rio doesn’t hide it when she checks Agatha out the same way Agatha’s been looking at her toned stomach.</p><p>Guess they can call it even.</p><p>“Have fun looking at my ass.” Agatha mutters, rolling her eyes as she turns and leads Rio toward the room where Lilia and Kate are waiting.</p><p>She’s only mildly aware of the fact that Rio has seen her half-naked on a giant screen. It’s the art of the job, and so what if she did, <em>really</em>? Rio clearly is not the only one who has seen it.</p><p>“I’ve also heard your moan.” Rio adds lightly from behind her, obviously not done with the teasing.</p><p>Agatha stops abruptly Rio nearly crashes into her. She turns in slow motion, hands planted firmly on her hips.</p><p>“That wasn’t even my <em>real </em>moan.”</p><p>“Oh?”</p><p>“That was acting.” Agatha clarifies, then, without permission from her brain, she blabbers, “My real moan is better. You should hear it.”</p><p>They stare at each other in surprise, the air between them suddenly charged. It is far too intimate, perhaps inappropriate for a hallway lined with movie posters.</p><p>Agatha realizes the depth of what she said, how it sounded, and how easy it came out of her mouth. Jesus Christ, what is <em>wrong </em>with her?</p><p>Rio blinks first, her face unreadable. She was taken aback to the point she is lost for words, which is a rare occurrence.</p><p>Agatha clears her throat, already backpedaling in her head. What she said was truly elegant, sarcasm intended. Nothing screams ‘<em>professional workshop mentor</em>’ than offering a live demonstration of—</p><p>“Well..” She breaks the silence, her voice almost shaking. “Hypothetically. You know. In theory.” In theory. <em>Sure</em>.</p><p>Rio’s eyes flicker over her face, like she’s trying to decide whether to let Agatha off the hook or watch her dig deeper. Agatha prays it’s the first one.</p><p>“Harkness, there you are!” Lilia’s voice echoes from down the hall, making them both flinch in surprise.</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes for half a second, breathing in relief. Thank God for Lilia’s impeccable timing, she might just be saved by the bell.</p><p>“We’re ready for you.” Lilia calls out. “And please tell me you’re not traumatizing our guest.”</p><p>Agatha turns back to Rio, hiding her mortification with feign nonchalance. “I don’t traumatize people. I would never!”</p><p>Rio laughs under her breath as she finally finds her voice after the wave of a shock Agatha has given her. “Sure you won’t.”</p><p>As they start walking again, Rio leans in just enough to murmur. “We can circle back to <u>that</u> conversation later.”</p><p>Agatha very nearly trips over nothing.</p><p>“It’s nice meeting you, Chef Vidal.” Lilia says when they finally gather in the room, shaking Rio’s hand with genuine warmth. “Rae is such an amazing kid with spectacular talent. You’ve raised her well.”</p><p>“My, thank you.” Rio replies. “I hope my daughter doesn’t give you too much of a headache.”</p><p>“Never to me! She’s one of the sweetest.” Lilia assures her, pulling out a chair at their makeshift conference table. “Although, we’ve missed her terribly. When is she coming back?”</p><p>It’s funny how Rae is sweet as pie to Lilia and a complete menace to Agatha. The kid really did something special to earn Lilia’s devotion, and Agatha surely respects the hustle despite the inconvenience it has brought her.</p><p>“They’re flying first thing tomorrow.” Rio answers. “And I’d also like to apologize if she didn’t formally inform anyone she’d be missing class.”</p><p>“She actually sent an email.” Lilia says, eyes widening as Kate arrives with a few glasses of water. “Kate didn’t see it until later.”</p><p>“I said I was sorry.” Kate mutters and when she glances up at Rio, she freezes. Recognition flashes across her face, her gaze darting to Agatha in a flash. “Hey, weren’t you the one—”</p><p>“Chop chop!” Agatha cuts in sharply, shooting Kate a warning look that very clearly states<em> finish that sentence and you’re dead.</em> “We should get to planning. We don’t want to waste the chef’s valuable time, don’t we?”</p><p>Kate mimes zipping her mouth shut, afraid of what Agatha might do to her.</p><p>They settle into planning Lilia’s event, with Rio and Lilia doing most of the talking. Agatha contributes sparingly, mostly with unnecessary commentary.</p><p><em>“That’s too tacky.”</em></p><p><em>“A chocolate fountain? Lilia, it’s not 2003.</em></p><p>Lilia shoots her a glare sharp enough to silence her.</p><p>Rio, meanwhile, remains unfazed. She is professional throughout, clearly in her element. Agatha finds herself watching despite her best efforts. The way Rio talks through menu options with ease, the thoughtful pauses, and that one particular habit of her tongue pressing into her cheek when she’s thinking deep.</p><p>Eventually, they wrap up the meeting with Kate typing final notes into her iPad. The event will be held on the last day of the workshop. Rio generously offers to make the dinner exclusive at Rayo de Sol for the kids, their parents, and the entire team.</p><p>“It’s a pleasure doing business with you, Chef Vidal. I appreciate the time and effort.” Lilia thanks her.</p><p>“Likewise, Ms. Calderu.”</p><p>“Oh, don’t be a stranger, dear. Lilia will do just fine.”</p><p>“Lilia, then.” Rio smiles. “Actually, I’d love to invite you three to the restaurant on Wednesday, if you’re free. We’ve got a jazz act coming in from Las Vegas, thought you might enjoy the atmosphere.”</p><p>Lilia gasps softly, a hand flying to her chest while Kate’s eyes practically light up. They’d been vocal about how much they loved Rio’s restaurant, though with the demand for reservations, it wasn’t somewhere they could visit whenever they wanted.</p><p>“Are you serious?” Kate blurts out.</p><p>Agatha crosses her arms, suspicious of this act. “We don’t want to impose.” She states, popping the happy bubble of the two. “We’ve already been firsthand witnesses to how good your food is. You don’t need to prove anything.”</p><p>Rio meets her gaze without missing a beat. “Oh no.” She mutters lightly. “I insist.” Her tone is firm yet playful, which makes Agatha’s mouth twitch.</p><p>“Well..” Lilia cuts in cheerfully. “It would be rude to refuse such generosity.”</p><p>Kate nods far too enthusiastically. “Extremely rude.”</p><p>Agatha pinches the bridge of her nose, guess she can’t run away from this one. “Of course you’d both say that.”</p><p>Rio laughs, soft and genuine. “Then it’s settled.”</p><p>They begin to head out, class time inching closer. Lilia and Kate hang back to discuss schedules, leaving Agatha to walk Rio toward the entrance.</p><p>A small cluster of parents waits in the lounge, mostly mothers clutching the newest iPhones and stanleys. If Agatha knew better, she’d assume there’s vodka in at least one of those drinks.</p><p>The moment their eyes swivel toward Agatha and Rio, recognition lights up their faces immediately. Agatha catches it and knows the exact reason why.</p><p>These women never seem to get tired of her, despite the fact that they’ve already met more than a few times. Maybe it’s the novelty of it all, your kid being part of an exclusive class with the one and <em>only </em>Agatha Harkness.</p><p>They’re constantly making an elaborate move to befriend her. Others bring food with the goal of impressing her, may it be homemade pastries or catered boxes. They want to cling to her so bad so that they have something else to boast about on brunch other than their kid’s A+ reports or their husbands latest stock investment.</p><p>Agatha is firm about her boundaries. She’s not the type to collect suburban friendships, especially not with women who smile too brightly. She very much knows that they’re also the type to backstab you the moment you stop looking.</p><p>She’s seen their kind before, even played the role herself once (spoiler alert: the character went completely off the rails.)</p><p>Still, she’d be lying if she said she didn’t enjoy the attention. It never gets old.</p><p>For now, she’s prepared to brush them off with practiced ease except, she doesn’t have to because the attention slides right past her.</p><p>Every pair of vulture eyes shifts, not lingering on Agatha this time, but landing squarely on the woman beside her.</p><p><em>Rio</em>.</p><p>Well, that’s new.</p><p>“Chef Vidal!”</p><p>They jump up from their usual seats and dash straight toward Agatha and Rio like a bunch of excited puppies being offered a small treat.</p><p>Paisley’s mom is the first to swoop in. “I knew that was you. I eat at Rayo del Sol all the time!”</p><p>Gavin’s mom follows close behind, breathless. “Me too. Impossible reservation, by the way. I had to wait four months.”</p><p>Agatha steps back automatically, shoes clicking against the floor. Rio simply smiles with her hands raised politely in greeting. The rest of the moms descend with the precision of a prey.</p><p>Their voices overlap one another with compliments, followed by questions, and unnecessary comments about how amazing Rio is in person. Agatha thinks at that moment that clearly, she isn’t the only celebrity in town.</p><p><em>Interesting</em>.</p><p>“I don’t usually gush like this..” Gavin’s mom continues, chuckling nervously, which is a lie because she gushes like that <em>all</em> the time. “But wow! You’re even more charming in person.”</p><p>Paisley’s mom nods emphatically. “Honestly? I don’t even like women like <em>that</em>—” She adds, lowering her voice conspiratorially, “But something about you is making me feel things.”</p><p>Agatha blinks, couldn’t quite believe what she just heard. <em>Excuse her?</em></p><p>The moms laugh. Rio laughs too, clearly flustered but gracious. “I’ll take that as a compliment.”</p><p>They crowd closer, closing the circle around Rio. Someone bumps Agatha’s shoulder, a move that almost knocks her off balance.</p><p>“Sorry!” The mom mutters distractedly, barely glancing at her as she squeezes past.</p><p>Then, without warning, a heel comes down squarely on Agatha’s foot, its sharpness buried straight to her skin. She bites back a yelp as sharp pain flares in.</p><p>She looks down. Of course, her open-toe shoes offer no protection. A trickle of blood runs between her toes, stark against her pale feet. Give it to Agatha to have a fair, easily bruised skin.</p><p>Perfect. <em>Just </em>perfect.</p><p>“I’m so sorry!” The mom who stepped on her chirps, already turning her back to Rio, completely oblivious to the damage they’ve done.</p><p>Agatha voluntarily stumbles half a step back this time to avoid being nudged again, ignoring the sting in her foot and the hint of redness creeping in her face.</p><p>She’s commanded sold-out theaters and held audiences in the palm of her hand with a single look. She knows how attention ebbs and flows. It can abandon you the second something shinier walks onstage.</p><p>And yet here she is, watching them orbit Rio. The compliments drip endlessly like honey from every direction. She sees hands casually brushing Rio’s arm. She hears a comment about how hot Rio looks, spoken with admiration.</p><p>Rio smiles like she often does, accepting every word with ease. Agatha doesn’t exactly know what she feels about <em>that</em>.</p><p>Her eyes narrow. Every giggle and whispered compliment from the other moms twists something tight in her chest. She can’t quite put a name to it, but watching how they hover around Rio, how they press close, how Rio meets their attention with that effortless warmth—it hits her all at once.</p><p>She doesn’t like it. Not one bit.</p><p>She <em>really, really</em> doesn’t like it.</p><p>“Alright!” Agatha yells, finally stepping forward. She’s had enough of whatever mass hysteria this is. “Chef Vidal has places to be.”</p><p>She pushes through the crowd, purposely nudging women aside as she slides a hand lightly onto Rio’s back. Not possessive but deliberate because, really, what right does she have to be possessive? Why would she even need to be? Who is she in Rio’s life, anyway?</p><p>That small act is enough to silently remind everyone in the room who’s really in control here.</p><p>“Of course.” Gavin’s mom murmurs. “Sorry.”</p><p>Paisley’s mom snickers, still a little breathless. “We just got excited!”</p><p>“Understandable.” Agatha replies, tight-lipped with a blank facial expression that leaves no room for argument. “Now, if you would excuse us.”</p><p>She steers Rio toward the exit, forcing herself to keep her stride steady. She’s about to drop Rio off at the curb, ready to let her go back to the restaurant or whatever it is she will do next while she deals with the chaos inside but then Rio slows, glancing down.</p><p>Her eyebrows raise, just slightly. “What happened to your feet?”</p><p>Rio’s wincing at the small trickle of blood against Agatha’s fair, delicate skin. Agatha tries to hide her foot and pretend it’s nothing, but Rio’s not fooled.</p><p>“Let’s not do that.” Rio says insistently. “You’re bleeding. We can’t just ignore that.”</p><p>Agatha stiffens, pride warring with practicality. “It’s nothing. It’s barely a scratch. I’ll be fine.”</p><p>Rio tilts her head, looking at Agatha with a firm look. “You’re not fine.”</p><p>“How can you say that?” Agatha snaps.  “These are my feet, not yours—hey!”</p><p>She can’t protest further when Rio reaches for her arm, gentle but firm, guiding her toward a direction Agatha has no choice but to follow.</p><p>“I have a first-aid kit in my car.” Rio tells her “And don’t even think about running unless you want me to carry you and trust me, I <em>can </em>do that.”</p><p>The possessiveness in Agatha’s chest tightens not for herself, but for the thought of someone else caring for her. She’s not used to letting anyone see her weak spots, may it be the smallest of bruise and yet here she is.</p><p>Agatha huffs, giving in. “Fine.”</p><p>Rio just smiles and brings her to the area where she parked her Bentley. She opens the passenger door and guides her inside. Agatha folds her arms once seated, but she doesn’t resist.</p><p>Rio finds a small first-aid kit in the glove compartment. Agatha watches her in the rearview mirror, an unknown emotion coiling in her chest. She knows she should be annoyed that someone else is fussing over her, but instead.. she can’t help the feeling of relief, and something infuriatingly unknown.</p><p>“Stop staring at me.” She rolls her eyes again.</p><p>Rio doesn’t, not really. She just kneels slightly beside the open car door to tend to Agatha’s foot, her touch careful and precise as if she knows what she’s doing, having done it a couple of times. <em>Probably</em>. </p><p>Agatha feels something rising from her chest. She knows it’s not from pain, but from the awareness that this attention, this care.. is hers.</p><p>And <em>hers </em>alone.</p><p>Her mind tries to shove the thought away, but it refused to be ignored. <em>This is inappropriate,</em> she tells herself. Completely inappropriate. </p><p>“Rae gets bruises all the time.” Rio says, dabbing a gauze over Agatha’s ankle. “Even from simple bumps. I guess I know where she got it from.”</p><p>“Well sorry if I’m so easily bruised. That’s not exactly something I can control.”</p><p>Rio laughs softly, the sound warm and teasing. “I know, I wasn’t even blaming you. I was just saying.”</p><p>A comfortable silence settles between them as Rio focuses on her feet, cleaning and wrapping with precision while Agatha fights to keep the storm of thoughts in her head from spilling out. </p><p>“You’re quite the celebrity out there.” Agatha lets her observation slip. “I didn’t realize people around here knew you so well.”</p><p>“I’m not.” Rio replies, glancing up for a second. “But I guess the moms know me from the restaurant, and some of their kids go to Rae’s school. Imagine what the PTA meetings are usually like.”</p><p>Agatha didn’t even attempt to picture it. The thought of even <em>more</em> moms hovering around Rio made her chest ache, a flush of <em>jealousy </em>creeping up her throat. </p><p>There it is. The unnamed feeling, <em>jealousy</em>.</p><p>Is she jealous? Of course not. Why would she be?</p><p>But then again, how can she explain the way her eyelids twitch when Rio smiled at someone else? And if that isn’t jealousy, then what the hell is it?</p><p>“Remember the first time we met?”</p><p>“Mhm?” </p><p>“You called me humble, but I think you’re the humble one. It’s more appropriate.”</p><p>One corner of Rio’s mouth tugs in amusement. “You’re just noticing now?”</p><p>Agatha sighs. “You’re insufferable sometimes.”</p><p>“Insufferable?” Rio questions. “I prefer charmingly <em>irresistible</em>.” Agatha rolls her eyes as Rio finishes cleaning her bruised foot. </p><p>She shifts slightly in her seat, leaning just a little forward, angling herself so they can stay this close without standing. Her knee brushed Rio’s thigh, and the heat of the contact shot straight through her chest.</p><p>Every inch of proximity makes her heart hammer. She tells herself to stay composed and to act cool, but as Rio meets her gaze with a soft smile, Agatha knew it was over for her.</p><p>“You’re testing me.” Agatha’s voice drop, almost in a challenging way.</p><p>“And you’re failing.” Rio grins, brushing her fingers lightly against Agatha’s calf as she adjusts the bandage. That simple contact sent an involuntary shiver up Agatha’s spine.</p><p>Agatha couldn’t help but recall the earlier moment in the workshop. All the teasing comments and the playful tension that had made her cheeks burn. The memory returns and can she feel her resolve crumbling a little.</p><p>Just a <em>bit</em>.</p><p>“You know..” Rio murmurs, voice low and teasing. “If I remember correctly, you still owe me a demonstration.”</p><p>Agatha freezes yet again. Her eyes locked on Rio’s, and in that moment, the world seemed to stop moving. </p><p>She’s become suddenly aware of the faint antiseptic smell, the quiet hum of the car, the bandage, the way Rio’s fingers rests gently on her ankle—all of it came together into one maddening moment. Her heartbeat thudded audibly in her ears, her skin tingling.</p><p><em>Fuck it.</em></p><p>Her rational mind is gone. She leans forward even more, resting both arms on Rio’s shoulders and pulling her close as her lips clashes with Rio’s in a sudden kiss.</p><p>All logic was gone. Every <em>“what if”</em> erased, every limit crossed. Agatha didn’t care. </p><p>She knew the moment she met Rio that she really, really liked her. Liked her more than she had any right to, more than she’d admit to anyone, even herself.</p><p>Rio’s eyes widen briefly in surprise, then softens. She doesn’t pull away. Instead, she tilts her head, letting Agatha set the pace.</p><p>When she finally gives in to the kiss, it’s slow and easy, with tenderness that makes Agatha’s chest ache and melt at the same time.</p><p><em>Fuck it.</em></p><p>She leans in harder, claiming Rio with a boldness she’s never allowed herself before, pressing her lips firmly against the other woman and letting everything else.. the wrong, the doubts, their situation, even the world—fall away.</p><p>When Agatha pulls back, Rio instinctively leans forward again, like she’s not quite ready to let the moment end. Agatha stops her with a single finger to her lips, gentle but firm.</p><p>“Now..” She teases, a dangerous glint in her eyes, “Don’t be too greedy.”</p><p>Rio blinks in daze. “Your lips are really soft.” She says, the thought escaping naturally before she can stop it. “That was—”</p><p>“Don’t mention it.” Agatha cuts in, already pushing Rio away so she can step out of the car. She moves in one graceful motion, as if her pulse isn’t racing. “Thanks for the aid.”</p><p>She walks off like she didn’t just knock the air out of another woman’s lungs.</p><p>A few steps in, Rio finds her voice. “You didn’t show me the demonstration!”</p><p>Agatha stops and grins to face Rio for the last time that day. “Maybe next time.”</p><p>Inside the building, the door closes behind her, and only then does the weight of it hit. The resolve she’d carefully stacked all week collapses in on itself. Every boundary she’d sworn to keep is ruined and every sensible thought is gone.</p><p>She shouldn’t have done that. She <em>knows</em> that. She really, really knows that but this time, she didn’t hold back.</p><p>Not for a second, definitely <em>not</em> in that kiss.</p><p>For the infinite time, Agatha thinks, <em>fuck it.</em> </p><p>She’ll leave it to the universe now—and see what it decides to do with her next. </p><p>Now, what do the kids say? Hashtag YOLO?</p><p>Well, hashtag fucking YOLO indeed.</p>

<p>“What do you think, chef?” Alice asks eagerly, setting the bowl down with practice carefulness of somebody doing a sacred offering.</p><p>Alice is one of Rio’s oldest friends, dating all the way back to college. She’s her partner in crime when testing shady food stands at their 20s turned to her most trusted sous chef in their 40s.</p><p>Steam curls up from the surface as Rio grabs a spoon to taste Alice’s variation of a poblano soup, a tweak from an old recipe. Whatever version of a midlife crisis Alice is having, it manifests itself in relentless innovation. Rio, for her part, is nothing but encouraging and supportive.</p><p>“It’s really good.” Rio tastes it once. Then again, slower this time as she lets the flavors sit. “But something’s missing.”</p><p>She scans the kitchen, eyes moving past stainless steel until they land firmly on the infamous wall where rows of spices lined up like old friends who know her too well, having spent so much time in the kitchen.</p><p>They do in fact <em>knew </em>her too well if they simply had minds of their own, each spices earning its honor from years of playing with flavor until it finally made sense.</p><p>It <em>always </em>made sense, no matter how hard the process is. That’s just how it goes for Rio.</p><p>She moves and reaches for a small bottle of ground coriander. Alice watches closely as Rio sprinkles it in, grabs a clean spoon, stirs, and tastes again.</p><p>She pushes the bowl toward her friend’s direction. “Try it now.”</p><p>Alice takes a spoonful, her eyes questioning but never skeptical. “Shit.” She mutters. “<em>C'est magnifique!</em>”</p><p>Rio laughs, nudging her playfully out of the way. “Best chef in town, remember?” It’s meant as a joke for her, although it just happens to be true for everyone else.</p><p>Her entire life, Rio had been handed options in golden trays. As the eldest daughter of Luella and Manolo Vidal, she was meant to inherit ancient legacies of fortune made from vast businesses. </p><p>But even as a kid, she never wanted to pursue career related to all of <em>that</em>. She never let money be the thing that defined her. She barely noticed it most days despite seeing huge infrastructures with her last name stamped on it everywhere she go. </p><p>All she ever really wanted is the kitchen, the food, and the act of cooking itself.</p><p>She knew how lucky she was to have parents who didn’t fight her on it. They allowed her to leave for culinary school in France without turning it into a scandal. They trusted her to find her own path, even when it didn’t look conventional.</p><p>Her restaurant wasn’t handed to her. Well, <em>restaurants</em>, rather.</p><p>She worked first, long shifts in someone else’s kitchen or the family’s hotel chain. She worked through burns and aching feet for paychecks that made enough, but it barely rivaled to what her college allowance had once been.</p><p>She saved and yes, she dipped into her trust fund when she decided it was the right time to build a restaurant of her own. She knew her privilege, having more than just a chef’s salary to rely on with other ventures such as investments and she had always acknowledged that.</p><p>Rayo del Sol came later. Rae was nine by then, old enough to read the sign and understand the sense of pride at what her mami had built, especially knowing it bore her name. She made sure everyone at school knew it, and she basked in the attention, loving every bit of it.</p><p>Speaking of Rae.. “<em>Mami!</em>”</p><p>The doors from the main dining room swing open, and Rae comes barreling in fast. “My love—” Rio startles, then laughs, opening her arms just in time for Rae to crash into her. She folds around her instinctively the same way she always does even when Rae was younger. “You’re here!”</p><p>“I missed you, mami.” Rae says, pulling back just enough to look up at her. “Were you incredibly sad without me?”</p><p>“Absolutely devastated.” Rio mutters solemnly, giving Rae’s hair a quick kiss. “Look at you, you’re sunburned! Did you forget sunscreen again?”</p><p>Rae shrugs nonchalantly. Pink dusts her cheeks and the bridge of her nose, glowing with evidence. “I wanted to get tan but considering how naturally pale I am, I’m basically a victim of the sun.”</p><p>“Such a tragic tale.” Rio says, cupping Rae’s face gently, thumbs brushing her warm face. “You’re going to peel.”</p><p>“Worth it.”</p><p>Rio smiles, but something in her chest eases in a way she hadn’t realized was tight in the first place.</p><p>She tends to do this. She counts the hours without meaning to and tells herself she’s busy enough not to notice the quiet.</p><p>There are a thousand things she could be worrying about. The restaurant. The kiss. Agatha. Rae.. but right now, Rae is here. She is sunburned and grinning and wrapped around her like she never left.</p><p>That’s enough to make Rio feel steady again, even if it’s temporary.</p><p>“I got something for everyone!” Rae announces happily. “I got you an anklet since you lost yours when we went to Mexico last year. I also brought spices native to Hawaii, I think you’ll love them!”</p><p>“That’s very generous of you, my love.” Rio says with adoration, moving a strand of hair behind Rae’s ears. “I hope your money didn’t all disappear.”</p><p>“Oh, abuela gave me more, so I got to splurge.” Rio rolls her eyes fondly. Everyone in her family spoils Rae, despite Rio’s constant warnings not to. They ignore her every time, giving her daughter everything she asks for—her mother being the number one suspect.</p><p>“I even got Lilia this really cute flowy beach bag.” Rae adds, miming its shape with her hands. “And some shell necklaces for my friends at the workshop!”</p><p>“You did?” Rio asks, suddenly hopeful. “Did you get anything for Agatha?”</p><p>“For who?”</p><p>“For Agatha.” <em>Surely</em>, Rio thinks. She wouldn’t have skipped Agatha when she’d bought gifts for others in the workshop.</p><p>Rae chuckles incredulously, as if her mami just told the worst joke she’s ever heard. “Why would I get <em>her</em> anything?”</p><p>Rio stills. “Because you said you got something for everyone?”</p><p>“Well, she’s not included in that <em>everyone</em>, mami. Don't be silly.” Rae says casually, crossing her arms. “She’s not even <em>anyone</em>.”</p><p>“Raina, what did I say about being nice?”</p><p>“I <em>am</em> being nice.” Rae pouts. “And what if I say I simply forgot about her?”</p><p>Rio sighs. She knows that tone, she’s very well acquainted with that tone. It’s the one Rae uses when she’s already made up her mind about how she feels and dares the world to challenge it. Anyone who does will be given a difficult time.</p><p>Rae <em>is</em> nice. Thoughtful, even. She brings gifts, she remembers birthdays, and she shows up whenever she’s needed. With that comes stubbornness in a very specific way.</p><p>Rio would describe it as rooted or principled. Once her daughter decides that something matters, she clutches it with unyielding intensity. When she determines it no longer holds weight, she releases it just as fiercely, letting it fall away as though it had never existed. </p><p>“Anyway..” Rae hums, already backing toward the door. “I’ll go say hi to the staff first. Will you be driving me home in awhile?”</p><p>“Of course I will.”</p><p>Rae smiles, then turns and jogs off toward the other area of the restaurant, calling out greetings as she goes.</p><p>Rio stays where she is, watching until Rae disappears completely. The melancholy comes quietly, a whole new different emotion settling in her chest this time around.</p><p>She never intended for Rae to feel a certain way of what seemed to be hatred for her birth mother. Or anyone, really. </p><p>From the beginning, Rio had been careful. Honest in ways that mattered. She made sure Rae understood that people don’t always leave because they don’t care. That sometimes, hurtful choices are made out love.</p><p>She had defended Agatha long before Rae even knew her name.</p><p>But Rae is <em>Rae</em>.</p><p>She doesn’t open easily. She listens, but she doesn’t accept without proof. She demands effort and consistency. Words mean nothing to her without action trailing close behind.</p><p>And Agatha, for all her brilliance, would have to live with the fact that she was already being measured by a girl who did not make room for excuses.</p><p>Rio presses a thumb on top of her temple, moving it in circling motion to avoid impending migraines.</p><p>“Honey, I’m here!”</p><p>A familiar voice cuts clean through the steady rhythm of the kitchen. A few heads turn from their stations as Wanda enters the room where Rio is.</p><p>“Back here.” Rio calls.</p><p>Wanda beams when she spots her. “I knew you’d be hiding close to where the knives are.”</p><p>“I live here.” Rio answers. “What did you forget this time?”</p><p>Wanda chuckles and reaches into her tote, producing a slim baking pan with a sheepish tilt of her head. “Your tart pan. I swear I meant to bring it back last week.”</p><p>Rio takes it from her, already grinning. “Say no more. If I had a dollar for every time someone kept my kitchenware hostage, I’d retire.”</p><p>“Sure, but you’d still cook.” Rio nods. That part is probably true.</p><p>Rae reappears the moment she hears Wanda’s voice, rushing to her aunt in excitement.</p><p>“Aunt Wanda!” </p><p>Wanda turns and visibly melts. “Oh my god.” She says, pressing a hand to her chest. “There she is. Every time I see you, you look older, and taller.. and somehow prettier, which feels unfair.”</p><p>Rae grins. “You’re contractually obligated to say that.”</p><p>“I am not.” Wanda insists. “I do it willingly. I mean, look at you!” Wanda lets Rae give a little twirl for show. She’s always had a soft spot for Rio’s daughter, filling a space she never quite had the chance to on her own.</p><p>Rio watches the exchange quietly. She’s seen it a hundred times before, people softening the second Rae enters a room. Rae has always carried that effect, even as a child.</p><p>“You didn’t come to my housewarming party.”</p><p>“I had ballet, but I’ll make sure to come visit soon!” Rae explains shortly. “Are the twins with you?”</p><p>“They’re sitting in the car refusing to get out.” Wanda groans. “They figured you might be here and Tommy is ever so defensive. Perhaps he got it from his father.”</p><p>Re’s eyes light up. “Are they actually scared of me?”</p><p>“Mortified.” Wanda says fondly. “Billy even locked the doors.”</p><p>Rae laughs. “Seriously?”</p><p>Wanda sighs and pulls her keys out of her bag, jingling them once before placing them into Rae’s open palm. “Have fun with it.”</p><p>“Yes!” Rae giggles, already walking away. “They’ve been avoiding me for the longest time, now they don’t have a choice.”</p><p>The kitchen door swings shut behind her, as Wanda watches her go with a soft smile. Then she turns back to Rio, eyebrow arching slightly. “She’s something else.”</p><p>“She always has been.” Rio mutters. “You know she’ll torture your sons, right?”</p><p>“Most likely.” Wanda waves a dismissive hand. “But they deserve it for giving me a hell of a week. I don’t know what it is with kids nowadays, they can’t even separate clean clothes from the laundry.”</p><p>“Thank God I have a girl.” </p><p>They laugh in chorus as Wanda leans against the counter, glancing around the kitchen with an appreciative nod. “Place looks busy.”</p><p>“All the time.” Rio confirms. “Though you did came at a calm moment, which means it won’t last.”</p><p>“I’ll savor it, then.” Wanda’s gaze lingers on Rio for a beat longer than necessary, a familiar glint appearing in her eyes. “So..”</p><p>Rio feels the shift, which signals that Wanda is about to poke at something. “So,” Rio echoes cautiously.</p><p>“You and my good friend Agatha Harkness.”</p><p>There it is. She’s been anticipating for Wanda to bring this up one way or another. “That’s one way to put it.”</p><p>Wanda’s smile turns delighted. “I’m still wrapping my head around it.”</p><p>“There’s nothing to wrap.” Rio shrugs. “She’s running a workshop in town. Rae’s enrolled in it. Voila!”</p><p>“Yes, Einstein.” Her friend quips. “I know that part. What I didn’t expect was for you two to be <em>that </em>close.”</p><p>“We’re not.”</p><p>“Nu-uh, my senses says otherwise.” Wanda presses more. “You’re acting suspiciously calm about this.”</p><p>“When have you become a busybody?” Rio asks. “Besides, I don’t see the point in dramatizing it. We simply know each other, Wands. That’s it.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t like lying, but she also knows this isn’t hers to explain. She isn’t even sure what is happening between her and Agatha—only that they’ve spent a few moments together, shared one kiss, and that somehow, Agatha has lingered in her thoughts since the moment they first met. </p><p>Still, that isn’t something she can hand to Wanda so easily. Or to anyone else, in that matter.</p><p>“It’s complicated.” Rio offers just enough to avoid a lie but not nearly enough to satisfy curiosity. She knows Wanda won’t stop prying unless she draws the line here.</p><p>Wanda’s grin widens. “Is it?”</p><p>“If anything happens, I promise I’ll let you know.” Rio assures her, even though she isn’t entirely sure what she means by that herself.</p><p>“Alright. Does Rae know?”</p><p>Rio’s stomach tightens in a way that is subtle but undeniable. “Know what?”</p><p>Wanda studies her for a moment. “Nothing. Just curious.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond immediately. She focuses her attention elsewhere as her thoughts drift. Rae bristles at the mere mention of Agatha, a reaction that feels too big to be casual dislike.</p><p>She doesn’t want Rae to carry anger she doesn’t fully understand. She also doesn’t want what she has with Agatha (whatever it is) to become a symbol of something broken before either of them has the chance to speak honestly.</p><p>Wanda softens, noticing Rio’s demeanor. “You know I’m mostly teasing, right?” Rio nods. “You don’t have to tell me anything, unless you want to.”</p><p>Rio mumbles a small, <em>“I know,</em>” as they settle into a different conversation, Wanda happily steering the topic away.</p><p>After a few minutes, the door swings open again as Rae reappears, looking absolutely triumphant.</p><p>“Honey, please tell me there’s no bloodshed.” Wanda says as Rae hands her back the car keys. “I just got a carwash.”</p><p>“I’d never do that to you.” Rae says with a smile, batting her eyelashes in mock innocence. Then she glances between them, perceptive despite her playful tone. “So, what did I miss?”</p><p>“Nothing.” Rio says quickly.</p><p>“We divulged ourselves in casual adult conversation that is monotonous to you young ones.” Wanda supplies.</p><p>Rae’s expressions are transparent, which makes her mood easier to read. She narrows her eyes but says nothing, which works to Rio’s advantage. “Mami, can we go home soon?” She asks instead.</p><p>Rio’s answer comes without hesitation. “Whenever you’re ready, my love.”</p><p>Wanda watches the two of them, something thoughtful passing over her face. “Well, I should get going before the twins decide the car is their new home.”</p><p>“You really should check on them.” Rio winces, mentally noting she should probably ask Rae what new schemes she’s cooked up to scare the twins this time. “And try to return my tart pan a little sooner next time.”</p><p>“No promises.” They exchange a quick hug as Wanda squeezes Rio’s arm knowingly before stepping away.</p><p>The next day, Rio drives Rae to the workshop earlier than planned, which isn’t unusual. Rio has always preferred arriving early to enjoy the calm before others fill it with noises.</p><p>Rae doesn’t complain. She’s seated cross-legged in the passenger seat, humming to herself as her fingers drum lightly against the paper bag resting in her lap. </p><p>When Rio had mentioned hosting Lilia's thanksgiving dinner for the workshop, Rae had lit up immediately. She’d launched into ideas such as theme suggestions, who should sit where, and what dessert would impress without trying too hard. </p><p>Rio listens patiently the entire time, silently savoring Rae’s presence. After a brief vacation, having her daughter back feels like the missing piece has been found. It also serves as a reminder of how quiet her life had been without her.</p><p>They pull into the parking lot and step out into the late morning air. Rae is already halfway into the building before Rio even opens the car door.</p><p>She follows her daughter into the large room where classes takes place. Only Lilia and Kate are there, seated close together with heads bent in conversation. Agatha is nowhere to be seen, give it to Rio to notice her absence right away.</p><p><em>Huh</em>. She hadn’t come here for Agatha but somehow, she’s searching for her. What does that say about Rio?</p><p>“I’ve missed you all!” Rae calls out brightly as she runs forward, nearly tripping over her own enthusiasm.</p><p>Lilia looks up and breaks into a wide smile. “Well, here is my <em>star</em>. Finally!” She stands to pull Rae into a hug. “How was Hawaii, sweetheart?”</p><p>“Sunny.” Rae says, pointing to her face. “Painfully so. My skin is protesting.”</p><p>Kate laughs. “I love your tan, Rae.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rae beams. “I hope I didn’t miss too much.”</p><p>“Nothing you can’t catch up on quickly.” Lilia tells her.</p><p>Rio remains by the door, hands loosely folded in front of her.</p><p>She loves moments like this. Moments where Rae is accepted without question, where her sharp edges are met with warmth instead of resistance.</p><p>Rae is kind but she is also firm, adamant when she feels challenged or dismissed. It’s a strength that sometimes makes the world push back harder than necessary.</p><p>Seeing her here, surrounded by people who like her as she is settles something in Rio’s chest.</p><p>“You’re here.” The voice comes from her left, making Rio jump slightly in surprise. She turns and finds Agatha standing there, having apparently materialized without warning.</p><p>To make things worse, she looks.. <em>unfair</em>.</p><p>She’s wearing a black button-up, loose enough to command attention as the neckline dips just <em>enough </em>to be distracting. Her hair is in its usual curly state, looking healthier than ever. On top of that, a pair of vintage looking glasses sit low on her nose.</p><p>Rio has to actively remind herself where she is and who she’s with.</p><p><em>Get it together, you freak.</em></p><p>“Oh.” She says, the word slipping out lower than intended. “Hi. I didn’t see you come in.”</p><p>“Clearly.” She remarks. “Why are you here?” Agatha asks casually, but there’s an undercurrent Rio can’t quite name.</p><p>“I have a proposal to discuss with Lilia about dinner.” She pauses, then adds gently, “Rae’s here too, she arrived yesterday.”</p><p>Agatha’s expression shifts upon the mention of Rae’s name.</p><p>If Rio weren’t looking at her intensely, she wouldn’t have catched the subtle flicker in her eyes. Agatha’s fingers lift instinctively to the necklace resting at her throat, thumb brushing over the pendant in one motion.</p><p>“Nice glasses.” Rio points out, hoping to smooth the moment before it hardens.</p><p>Agatha glances at her. “They’re for reading.” She replies, already removing them. She sets her glasses carefully on top of her clothes, much to Rio’s quiet disappointment. “I got sent a script last night so I had to look it over.”</p><p>“Oh.” Rio mutters once more. “That makes sense.”</p><p>They stand there for a moment, neither quite stepping away. Rio is acutely aware of the space between them, the memory of their kiss humming under her skin. </p><p>She <em>likes </em>Agatha. There’s no point denying it anymore. She likes her in a way that feels reckless and grounding all at once, and it scares her.</p><p>Liking Agatha doesn’t exist in some separate dimension. It exists here, in the same world as Rae. And Rae.. Rae has mixed feelings toward Agatha which might complicate everything if they decide to act on them. </p><p>That is—<em>if</em> Agatha feels the same way at all.</p><p>“Mami!” Rae calls from across the room. “Come here!”</p><p>The spell breaks as Rio gestures lightly toward the room. “Come on.” She says to Agatha, already moving.</p><p>The paper bag is open now, souvenirs laid out neatly across a table. Rae stands proudly in front of them, hands clasped behind her back.</p><p>“This is for you.” Rae announces, pushing one toward Lilia. “I bought you this bag and this scarf because I thought it matched your vibe.”</p><p>Lilia laughs, touched. “You remembered me.”</p><p>“Of course I did.”</p><p>“And this is for you.” Rae continues, handing Kate a small box. “That’s not Van Cleef but it’s a really pretty bracelet.”</p><p>Kate’s giggles. “Thank you, Rae.”</p><p>“Well..” Agatha steps forward at last, revealing herself to the rest of the group. “If it isn’t Rae. Back so soon?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rae replies coolly. “I couldn’t let you keep believing you’re the best actor in the room other than Lilia. Someone has to humble you.”</p><p>Agatha smirks. “Bold of you to assume you could.”</p><p>Rio stands there, heart caught somewhere between them.</p><p>She understands Rae’s defensiveness. She understands Agatha’s restraint. And she hates that she’s the only one in the room who understands both.</p><p>This is exactly what scares her.</p><p>She wants Agatha. The sharp wit and the quiet moments where Agatha lets her guard slip. She likes how alive she feels around her.</p><p>At the same time, she loves Rae. Real love demands care and understanding. That’s what makes it confusing, the conflict of this all.</p><p>Rio doesn’t know how to bridge that gap yet. For now, she only knows she’s standing right in the middle of it.</p><p>“I know I could.” Rae grins. “I’m young and I haven’t even reached my prime. Imagine what I could do then.”</p><p>Agatha turns fully toward her now, hands slipping casually into her pockets. “You know, for someone who missed a few classes, you seem very eager to critique.”</p><p>“I had time to reflect.” Rae replies sweetly. “Distance does wonders for clarity. You should try it sometime.”</p><p>Rio watches them circle each other with practiced ease. To Kate and Lilia, it probably reads as harmless sparring. A teenager testing boundaries and an actress enjoying the challenge, nothing more.</p><p>But Rio knows better. She sees the precision in Rae’s words, the way each sentence lands exactly where it’s meant to. She sees how Agatha never looks away, how her attention sharpens rather than floats away. This is <em>nowhere</em> near casual.</p><p>“Alright, children!” Lilia interferes. “Save the dueling philosophies for later.”</p><p>“Sorry, Lilia.”</p><p>Agatha inclines her head. “Of course.”</p><p>Kate gestures to the table. “These gifts are really thoughtful, Rae.”</p><p>“They’re souvenirs.” Rae clarifies. “I figured if I was going to be gone, I should come back properly.”</p><p>Agatha hums. “Preparedness, another surprise.”</p><p>Rae glances back at her. “You seem disappointed.”</p><p>Agatha arches a brow. “Should I be?”</p><p>“You look like you are, unless I’m mistaken.” Rae mocks, shrugging. “I didn’t get you anything though. I really didn’t thought of you, apparently you have slipped my mind.”</p><p>Rio feels it then as she watches Agatha, whose jaw tightens for a fraction of a second before she smooths it away.</p><p>“<em>Raina</em>.” Rio says her name, nothing more. But Rae takes it as a warning and doesn’t push further. Brave as she is, Rae has her limits, especially when Rio uses her full name, the one that clearly says <em>don’t be difficult</em>.</p><p>“You know, Rae, you’re the only person I’ve met who gets sunburned as badly as Agatha.” Lilia steers the conversation, her tone light. “She suffered through the same thing in Cabo a few months ago, despite all the expensive sunscreen she swears she applied.”</p><p>“Lilia, I don’t think they want to hear that story.” Agatha deadpans.</p><p>“I’m just saying.” Lilia grits her teeth, giving Agatha a pointed look. “You two are a lot more alike than you’d care to admit, despite all the banter.”</p><p>Rio almost chokes on nothing. Lilia says it casually, but all three of them feel the weight behind it: the resemblance, the mirrored stubbornness, the quiet ways they’re drawn together. It’s impossible to miss, and they know exactly why.</p><p>Lilia claps her hands once. “Alright, that’s enough. Chef Vidal, why don’t you tell us what you wanted to discuss?”</p><p>“Right. Yes. So—” Rio is glad to finally put an end to the tension Rae and Agatha had created.</p><p>She recognizes the tension for what it is. They are two people testing strength and measuring each other’s intent. Rae has built a wall while Agatha is holding herself carefully, acutely aware of every misstep.</p><p>Rio joins the rest of the adults at the table while Rae lingers nearby, close enough to hear everything without saying much. </p><p>The proposal moves easily. Lilia asks thoughtful questions, Kate chimes in with logistics, and Agatha listens more than she speaks, offering the occasional condescending comments. </p><p>At some point, Agatha shifts in her chair, reaching for her bag, and her glasses slip free. Once it hit the floor softly, both of them move at once.</p><p>Rio bends instinctively, already reaching out, and Agatha does the same. Their hands collide, fingers brushing before either of them can pull away. </p><p>Rio stills in her place as Agatha’s breath catches. For a second, the room feels distant, reduced to the space between their hands and the quiet awareness of each other.</p><p>Agatha looks up first, sharp blue eyes meeting Rio’s. Rio feels something warm and dangerous settle low in her chest. She likes this.. she likes the closeness, the accidental intimacy, and the way Agatha doesn’t joke her way out of it pronto.</p><p>Then Lilia coughs, the moment breaking at once.</p><p>Agatha withdraws her hand quickly, straightening her posture in the chair. Rio, whose hands reached the glasses first, passes them to her.</p><p>“Thanks.” Agatha takes them carefully, slipping them on calmly rather than tucking them back into her clothes.</p><p>“No worries.” Rio replies.</p><p>Rae’s gaze flicks between them before she looks away again as if she's bored.</p><p>The rest of the conversation wraps itself up without ceremony. Lilia is satisfied and Rio nods along, committing additional details to memory. </p><p>Rio slings her bag over her shoulder and moves toward the door, each step measured. Agatha rises as well, just enough to meet her gaze, a subtle pull that says <em>don’t go just yet</em>. </p><p>Rio stops, caught by the quiet insistence in her posture. “Wait.” Agatha says, voice low, almost hopeful. “I—”</p><p>Rae clears her throat behind them, a single note that cuts through the shared space. Rio glances back and sees her daughter standing near the doorway, her presence alone says <em>mami, that’s enough.</em></p><p>Rio sighs slowly. She wants to stay. She wants to step forward, brush a stray curl from Agatha’s face, maybe lean in close enough to hear her laugh. She wants to reach for the warmth she’s felt lingering since the last time they were alone, the faint ache left by stolen glances and an unforgettable kiss. </p><p>However, Rae’s steadying presence keeps her rooted. Rae comes <em>first</em>. Always had, always been, always will. Rio reminds herself of that.</p><p>“I have a meeting to go to.” Rio says, her tone apologetic. “I’ll see you some other time?”</p><p>She catches the hint of disappointment across Agatha’s face, but the woman masks it just as quickly. “If my schedule permits.” Agatha replies, the calm politeness burying the hope that hides just beneath.</p><p>Rio takes it as her cue to leave, offering a final goodbye to the team before letting Rae lead her toward the parking lot.</p><p>Once in the car, Rio settles into the driver’s seat, hands gripping the wheel a little tighter than necessary. Her mind keeps drifting back to Agatha’s gaze, that quiet mix of hope and restraint that she can’t shake. She can’t bear the weight of that look lingering unacknowledged, not when she’s trapped in traffic.</p><p>Almost reflexively, she pulls out her phone and sends a short message.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Rio:</strong> are you okay?</p></blockquote><p>A typing bubble appears on Rio’s screen, and she watches it blink and fade. A full minute passes without a reply. Sighing softly, she sets her phone down, telling herself that Agatha is probably just busy with class, too caught up to respond right now.</p><p>That same night, the living room is dim except for the glow of the television. One of Rio’s comfort cooking shows plays softly, the host narrating something about the role of technology in cooking.</p><p>Rae is sprawled across her mami’s lap, knees tucked up, Kindle balanced against her chest. Rio’s fingers move through her long hair in slow strokes, the motion as familiar as breathing.</p><p>“Mami?”</p><p>“Mhm?” Rio hums, eyes still on the screen as her thumb presses the remote, pausing the show.</p><p>“<em>Would you ever date again?</em>”</p><p>Rio’s fingers still as she chuckles awkwardly. “Where’s that coming from?”</p><p>“I don’t know.” Rae says. “Just a question.”</p><p>It’s never just a question with Rae. Rio knows this. She’s known it since Rae was little, how her daughter tests the ground before stepping into it. </p><p>Rae is observant and notices everything, she always has. She just chooses carefully what she <em>admits</em> to noticing.</p><p>Rio keeps her tone even. “Honestly, I couldn’t say for sure.” She watches the words as she says them, weighing each one. “I’m not closing that chapter of my life. Who knows? Maybe one day.”</p><p>Rae doesn’t respond right away. The silence stretches as Rae shifts. She pushes herself upright, turning so she’s sitting and facing Rio properly now. Her Kindle is forgotten on the couch.</p><p>“Mami.” She calls again, quieter this time.</p><p>“Yes, my love?”</p><p>“Does what I think still matter to you?”</p><p>Rio’s chest tightens but she doesn’t hesitate. “Of course it does.” Her hand moves to Rae’s cheek, thumb brushing lightly along her jaw. “It always will. You know you’re the most important person in my life, right?”</p><p>Rae’s mouth curves into a small smile. “I know, mami.”</p><p>She nods once, as if confirming something internally, then adds, “But hypothetically—if you dated someone, and I didn’t like that someone.. would you listen to me?” Rae’s voice cracks just a little. “Would you.. would you even <em>choose</em> me?”</p><p>The question lands harder than the others.</p><p>She looks at her daughter.. really looks at her. The careful way Rae carries herself, the quiet vulnerability she doesn’t try to hide. The way her eyes search Rio’s face for answers.</p><p>Rio understands then, with a clarity that hurts a little.</p><p>Rae knows <em>something</em>. Rio doesn’t know what, or how, but she can feel the awareness slipping through the cracks. Rae knows enough to sense the presence of <em>someone</em> new orbiting too close.</p><p>Rio feels the conflict rise in her chest because there is <em>indeed </em>someone. Because she is, against her better judgment, already in deeper than she meant to be. </p><p>Rio will cross that bridge when she comes to it, deciding later if she should act on her feelings. For now, she cups Rae’s face gently, grounding herself in the warmth of her skin.</p><p>“I will always choose you.” Her voice did not waver. “There is no version of my life where I don’t.”</p><p>Rae studies her for a moment longer, as if testing the truth of it. Then she nods, satisfied. “I couldn't be luckier to have you as my mom, mami.”</p><p>She turns back and settles into Rio’s lap again, grabbing her Kindle. Rae goes quiet, but Rio’s thoughts refuse to settle so easily. While she continues stroking Rae’s hair, her mind drifts back to Agatha, the <em>someone </em>in question. </p><p>Being around her presence, her voice, to the way her glasses slipped and how absurdly intimate that moment felt. To how <em>alive</em> she’d felt, and how <em>guilty</em> that aliveness now seems.</p><p>Rio presses her lips briefly to the top of Rae’s head. She loves her daughter more than anything. That part is simple and non-negotiable.</p><p>What isn’t simple is the realization that her heart has started to <em>want</em> something else, and that wanting doesn’t feel like a betrayal, even if it might look like one from the outside.</p><p>Rio sits there, holding both truths at once, knowing this is only the beginning.</p><p>She can only hope it will make sense one day, just like everything else in her life.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> I’m planning to speak with Rae today.</p></blockquote><p>Agatha stares at the screen a beat longer than necessary before sliding her phone back into her pocket, in case Rio replies late. Or early. Or if she even replies at all, after Agatha left her on read the other day.</p><p>She tells herself she doesn’t care—which is a lie, but at least it’s a familiar one.</p><p>She has sworn that she’ll finally find the nerve to speak to Rae now that the kid is back from vacation. She’s rehearsed the conversation more times than she’s willing to admit, practiced it in the mirror with different expressions and tones. </p><p>She tried being casual, which seems far <em>too</em> casual for her liking. Detached might make Rae feel like she doesn’t take this seriously. She attempted to be maternal, which she immediately scraps because it looks ridiculous on her.</p><p>None of it matters. She knows the second Rae looks at her, the words will disappear all at once. She tells herself that the intention is there, and that has to count for something.</p><p>Agatha wants to work it out if Rae will let her. Whatever role Rae is willing to tolerate her in, she’ll take it. She’s not that greedy.</p><p>What she can’t fathom is Rae telling her to disappear completely from her life without giving her a chance of being there at all.</p><p>It’s not unlikely, considering their history. Agatha prepares herself for the worst. She can only pray that whatever decision the kid makes, hopefully she makes peace with it.. </p><p>Although, accepting it doesn’t mean it won’t hurt.</p><p>But what are Agatha Harkness’ awards if she can’t pull a performance? She can smile throughout, take the hit with grace, and walk away pretending her heart isn’t being pulled apart by the simple possibility of it.</p><p>Agatha’s fingers curl around the pendant at her throat as her gaze sweeps the room, searching for Rae. She thinks of more reasons to make the kid listen to whatever she has to say later on.</p><p>For today’s workshop activity, the young actors are tasked with creating original scenes in groups, allowing them full creative control of their choosing. Rae, of course, has appointed herself the lead, the director, and the writer, of her small army.</p><p>Agatha can’t help the secret grin that curves her mouth every time she passes Rae’s group. Rae is bossing everyone around her, issuing instructions with the confidence of someone used to being in charge.</p><p>“No, don’t stand there. You’re blocking the light. And don’t do that thing with your face when you deliver the last line, you look constipated.”</p><p>She keeps walking, hands clasped behind her back and handing out comments every now and then. Rae doesn’t acknowledge her, at least not directly. </p><p>Agatha sees the way Rae’s attention sharpens whenever she speaks to the room. The way Rae’s head tilts just slightly as she glances over and then looks away too fast when Agatha catches her.</p><p>She always pretends she isn’t listening, but she’s the one who takes Agatha’s feedback best.</p><p><em>Truly</em>, Agatha thinks, <em>my daughter.</em></p><p>As she continues pacing the workshop, something finally catches her eye. And no—it’s not Rae’s sunburned cheeks, though Agatha does file that away for later concern and future sunscreen recommendation.</p><p>Agatha stops beside Rae’s group.</p><p>“Rae, <em>darling</em>..” She says in her most exquisitely condescending tone. “Can you come with me for a minute?”</p><p>Every head swivels toward Rae in anticipation while Rae herself raises a brow at her, unimpressed and unbothered.</p><p>“We’re busy planning, Ms. Harkness.” Rae replies, dragging out the honorific in spite. “Is it important, or can it wait?”</p><p>“It cannot, actually.” Agatha turns on her heel, already walking away. “Unless you’d like me to interrupt your entire production instead. Which, believe me, I’m more than capable of doing.”</p><p>She pauses just long enough to glance back over her shoulder.</p><p>“Now.” She adds seriously. “Please.”</p><p>Rae follows her into the hallway. She makes a whole production of it, feet hitting the floor harder than necessary. Agatha keeps walking, fighting the very real urge to roll her eyes at the theatrics.</p><p>“What?” Rae demands the second they’re out of earshot, already looking bored. “Are you sabotaging our performance by removing me from my group? You know they cannot function without me.”</p><p>Agatha finally slows, then turns to face her.</p><p>The more Rae talks, the more she notices it. There’s a shift in her voice, a faint nasal edge that definitely wasn’t there last time.</p><p>“You’re sick.” Agatha says flatly.</p><p>Rae blinks. “For caring about my group?” She asks, eyes widening in mock offense. “The bar is low, I fear.”</p><p>“No.” Agatha retorts. “Not that kind of sick.”</p><p>She studies Rae more closely now. The flushed cheeks. The glassiness around the eyes. The way Rae’s posture is just a fraction stiffer than usual. </p><p>“You’re sick as in you’re not well.”  Agatha clarifies.</p><p>Rae scoffs. “Since when did you become a physicia—” She cuts herself off with a sudden sneeze, barely managing to cover her mouth with her hands.</p><p>Agatha pauses, deeply satisfied to be proven right. “See? You’re sick.”</p><p>“I am not.” Rae insists, blinking rapidly as her eyes water. Another sneeze follows, louder this time.</p><p>“You literally just sneezed in front of me, Rae. Twice.”</p><p>“It’s dusty out here.” Rae snaps. “Aggressively dusty.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t respond. She steps forward and presses her palm to Rae’s forehead without warning.</p><p>Rae stiffens. “Hey—”</p><p>Agatha grimaces and pulls her hand back. “God, you’re burning.”</p><p>Rae frowns. “I’m fine.”</p><p>“You are on fire, <em>not</em> fine.”  Agatha says dryly. “How are you even upright, let alone terrorizing your peers?”</p><p>“I am leading them.” Rae corrects. “Someone has to.”</p><p>Agatha breathes through her nose, irritation and concern tangling together in a way she very much does not appreciate.</p><p>“You’re going to pass out dramatically mid-monologue.” She says. “And while that might be memorable, it’s not the kind of workshop I’m aiming for.”</p><p>She tilts her head, eyes narrowing when Rae goes quiet. “How long have you felt like this?”</p><p>“I told you, I’m not sick.”</p><p>“Tell me that one more time..” Agatha murmurs “And I swear I’m rating your group the lowest possible score should you insist on performing.”</p><p>She knows that threatening a teenager is not ideal but sometimes, you do what you have to do especially when the teenager in question is apparently powered by spite.</p><p>Rae straightens immediately. “I started sneezing when I got here but it wasn't bad.. just a few here and there. I didn’t notice I have fever, I didn’t know until you pointed it out.” She hesitates, then adds, “I have been more tired than usual. I just thought it was because of traveling.”</p><p>Agatha softens almost instantly, irritation giving way to concern. She’s already pulling her phone out, thumb moving on muscle memory alone.</p><p>“You’re going home.” </p><p>“What? No, I cannot!” Rae protests. “What about my performa—” She sneezes again, mid-sentence.</p><p>“I can’t miss it!” Rae continues stubbornly. “I’ve been working hard the last few hours. Our ship will sink without me and I cannot let that happen.”</p><p>“Again,” Agatha says, eyes locked on her phone as she searches for Rio’s contact. “I cannot have you fainting theatrically in my workshop. It sets a bad precedent.”</p><p>She finally looks up. “I’ll have your mami pick you up.”</p><p>“My mami’s not here.” Rae crosses her arms, clearly pleased with herself. “So, no one’s picking me up which means I get to stay.”</p><p>Agatha’s fingers still. “Where is your mami?” She wants to add, <em>why isn't she replying to me</em>? but Rae wouldn't know why.. would she?</p><p>“She drove five hours to Northview for a convention.” Rae tells her. “She’s not coming back until tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha closes her eyes for half a second, feeling the problem bloom fully formed in her chest. “Then who are you staying with tonight?”</p><p>“Mrs. Davis.”</p><p>Agatha opens her eyes. “Who?”</p><p>“She used to take care of my mami when she was younger.” Rae explains. “She’s not officially working now, but she comes by sometimes to check on us and help if she can in the house.” Rae squints at her. “Why am I even explaining this to you?”</p><p>Agatha ignores that. “Fine. Ask Mrs. Davis to pick you up, then.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Rae.”</p><p>“I can’t.”</p><p>It's Agatha's turn to ask. “And why, exactly, can’t you?”</p><p>Rae shrugs, casual again, like the answer is obvious. “She won’t be coming over until dinner.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her. <em>Dinner</em>, a few hours from now.</p><p>“So..” Agatha mutters carefully. “Your plan is to stay here, visibly feverish, sneeze your way through rehearsal, and then.. what? Walk home?”</p><p>“It's not as bad as you think, Meredith Grey.” Rae deadpans. “And FYI, I take uber.”</p><p>“That is not a defense.” Agatha grits her teeth. “Must I reiterate that you cannot stay here.”</p><p>“And must I reiterate as well that I’m not leaving.” Rae fires back, chin lifting.</p><p>There it is. The stalemate. She actually wonders if Rae knows chest, which is not necessary this time but should be a good thing to know for Agatha.</p><p>She lowers her phone slowly and looks at Rae, the stubborn set of her mouth that feels.. painfully familiar.</p><p>“I cannot have you stay here either.” Agatha’s voice is firm now, leaving no room for argument. “You will risk getting everyone infected with whatever it is you’re brewing, including me.”</p><p>She studies Rae again, then adds, almost begrudgingly, “Are your grandparents around?”</p><p>“No.” Rae replies. “They travel a lot. Abuela already had plans to go to Fiji right after our Hawaii trip.”</p><p>Agatha massages her temple, eyes closing briefly again as if she can will a solution into existence. When she opens them, she looks resigned. “Fine. You’re coming with me, then.”</p><p>Rae laughs, startled. “You’re joking.”</p><p>“If I were,” Agatha glares at her. “I’d be laughing too.” She turns back to Rae. “Go grab your things. I’m driving you home.”</p><p>“Oh my god, you are insufferable!” Rae exclaims. “I’m not letting you kidnap me.”</p><p>“Is it kidnapping when I am very clearly informing you of my intentions?” Agatha asks calmly, lifting a brow. “Go. Now.”</p><p>Rae plants herself by the door, gripping the handle in case Agatha has plans of physically dragging her away. “I’m not leaving.” She insists. “Not until our performance is over.”</p><p>“You are contagious.”</p><p>“I can wear a mask.”</p><p>Agatha steadies herself. Maybe she can just bargain with this one since intimidation clearly doesn't work..</p><p>“You obviously haven’t taken care of a kid.” Rae taunts her. “It’s just a fever and some sneezing. It’s not going to kill me.”</p><p>That part, unfortunately, is true. And Agatha supposes taking care of a kid can’t be that different from taking care of an adult. How hard could it be?</p><p>“Be that as it may..” Agatha begins, pointing a finger at her. “You are coming with me afterward unless another responsible adult takes over.” Her eyes narrow. “And if I see you feeling even slightly worse in there, I'll pull you out immediately.”</p><p>“I’m not weak.” Rae rolls her eyes, sneezing again for the.. honestly? Agatha lost count.</p><p>The moment someone hands her a mask, Rae barely makes it five minutes back inside before she abandons her group and collapses into the nearest chair. She’s sweating despite the cold air, shoulders slumped, bravado gone quiet.</p><p>She is, in fact, <em>weak</em>. Agatha notices immediately.</p><p>Of course she does. She’s looking at her like a hawk.</p><p>She watches from across the room as Rae presses her elbows to her knees, head dipping forward, breathing just a little too heavy for someone who insisted she was fine.</p><p>“Unbelievable.” Agatha whispers and starts walking toward her.</p><p>“Okay, superstar. We’re leaving.” She stops in front of her, blocking her escape.</p><p>Rae looks up at her through the edge of the mask. “No, we're not.”</p><p>“<em>Raina</em>.”</p><p>The name lands between them.</p><p>It’s the first time Agatha has ever said it out loud. She’s only heard it from Rio and once from Jen. She never trusted herself with it before until now. </p><p>“I’m not buying any of your excuses.” Agatha continues evenly. “And I’m not negotiating.”</p><p>That does it. Rae huffs, muttering something under her breath, but she pushes herself up anyway even if she's reluctant. She follows Agatha as she explains things to Lilia in a low voice. Lilia doesn’t ask questions. She just nods once, understanding quickly, though the look she gives Agatha suggests there will be words later.</p><p><em>Fine</em>. Agatha can take that.</p><p>She guides Rae out to the parking lot and toward her car. Predictably, Rae opens the back door instead of the passenger seat and sprawls across it immediately.</p><p>Agatha pretends not to notice how exhausted Rae looks. She starts the engine instead.</p><p>“You don’t even know where I live.” Rae’s voice is muffled as she stares out the window.</p><p>Agatha checks the mirrors, then pulls out smoothly. “Which means now is the perfect time to tell me.”</p><p>Rae doesn’t answer.</p><p>Agatha sighs. “Or,” She adds lightly. “I can take you straight to a pediatric clinic. Your choice.”</p><p>There’s a pause.</p><p>Rae sits up just enough to glare at her. “You’re cruel.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look at her as she signals out of the lot. “I prefer efficient.” Her grip tightens on the wheel, just slightly.</p><p>“Address.” She adds. “Now, please.”</p><p>The drive goes by quickly. Agatha is a reckless but safe driver, as she insists. Rae complains the entire time, claiming she’ll die in a car crash long before any disease gets to her.</p><p>They arrive in the exclusive uphill village in Westview a few minutes later.</p><p>When Agatha pulls up, she’s surprised to find a two-storey house that’s modern and warm instead of being aggressively enormous and flashy. It’s built with light stone and dark wood. Wide windows face the front, letting in a lot of natural light.</p><p>Big, yes—but not massive. Not the kind of mansion Agatha had half-expected for Rio and Rae to live in. A straight stone path leads up to a solid wooden front door, surrounded by neat greenery.</p><p>Agatha will take this house apart later. Right now, she has a groaning kid in the backseat who will not stop sneezing.</p><p>“You’re sneezing and you have a fever.” Agatha says, stopping the engine. “What’s next? Coughing?”</p><p>“It should be in about an hour.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t argue, she knows better. Sick Rae is <em>more</em> dramatic than usual Rae, and this is not her first rodeo.</p><p>She steps out, opens the back door. Rae is slumped sideways, arms crossed over her chest.</p><p>“I’m sorry.” Agatha fakes a pout. “Should I be getting you a wheelchair?”</p><p>“I want <em>my</em> mami.” Rae mutters. “I’m not going into my own house with only you. What if you do something to me?”</p><p>Agatha pinches the bridge of her nose. “What would I even do to you?” She says dryly. “The worst thing I can do is shove a tablet down your throat when you’re too stubborn to swallow it.”</p><p>Rae glares before sneezing again. “No.”</p><p>“You never grew out of the no phase, did you?” Agatha sighs. “You told me your mami is not going home until tomorrow. What’s your plan here?”</p><p>“Call her.” Rae demands. “I want verbal confirmation, I also want someone else to know you were the last person with me if I mysteriously perish tomorrow.”</p><p>Agatha stares at the stubborn kid before her and briefly considers screaming. She doesn't.</p><p>So to humor Rae, she pulls out her phone and begins to dial.</p><p>“You have my mami’s number?!” Rae jolts upright.</p><p>“You literally asked me to call her.”</p><p>“But why do you have her number?”</p><p>Before Agatha can answer—</p><p>“<em>Hello?</em>” Rio’s voice cuts in smoothly. “<em>Agatha, I’m driving—can I call you back?</em>”</p><p>“No.” Agatha answers. “You’re on speaker. <em>Your</em> daughter is sick.”</p><p>“<em>Rae</em>?”</p><p>“Yes, Rio. Rae.” Agatha states the obvious. “Unless you’ve been hiding a second one. Would you mind introducing her to the class?”</p><p>Rae shoots her a look sharp enough to cut glass. The suggestion of possibly having another sibling is not being taken well. <em>Huh</em>. This kid is really accustomed to the only child lifestyle..</p><p>“<em>Are you with her?</em>” Rio asks. “<em>How is she?</em>”</p><p>“She’s burning up and sneezing.” Agatha confirms. “I drove her home.”</p><p>There’s a pause, followed by a swallow. “<em>She can hear me, right?</em>”</p><p>Agatha nods even though Rio can’t see it and angles the phone closer to Rae.</p><p>“<em>Rae?</em>”</p><p>Rae doesn’t answer. She simply frowns.</p><p>“<em>Agatha,</em>” Rio says carefully, “<em>Is Rae really there?</em>”</p><p>“She’s here.” Agatha insists. “She's being selectively mute.”</p><p>“Mami.” Rae speaks suddenly, snatching the phone from Agatha. “Someone on my flight to Hawaii wasn’t wearing a mask and now I’m clearly infected and sick.”</p><p>“<em>Right..</em>” Rio hums, not sounding convinced but choosing peace. “<em>Okay, my love. You know where your medications are, yes? I’ll call Mrs. Davis so she can come check on you. For now, change into your pajamas and drink lots of water.</em>”</p><p>“Do I have cough syrup?”</p><p>“<em>Yes, I bought you a new one recently.</em>”</p><p>Agatha can’t help herself. “Cough syrup for what?”</p><p>“For diarrhea.” Rae deadpans. “Of course it's for cough, <em>duh</em>. Let’s use our brains sometimes, shall we?”</p><p>“But you’re not coughing.”</p><p>“I told you I’d be coughing later.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha?</em>” Rio interrupts. “<em>Uh.. Rae gets sick a lot. We’ve been to so many doctors, but they can’t really explain it. When she gets a simple fever, it’s never just a fever. There’s always coughing and sneezing, sometimes nausea and vomiting.</em>”</p><p>Agatha’s mouth opens slightly as realization hits. <em>Oh</em>.</p><p>If Rae gets sick easily.. is it likely that it’s because of her?</p><p>The thought lands heavier than she expects, settling somewhere uncomfortable in her chest. Genetics is something passed down without permission.</p><p>Is this her <em>fault</em>?</p><p>Rae sneezes again, snapping Agatha out of her thoughts. Unfortunately, the spiraling will have to wait.</p><p>“Rio.” Agatha glances at Rae while she speaks. “Tell her she can safely go with me. I can stay until you get here or Mrs.. whoever it was.”</p><p>“<em>Mrs. Davis.</em>” Rio supplies.</p><p>“Right. Her.”</p><p>There’s a pause. “<em>But would that be okay with you?</em>” Rio asks carefully. “<em>We’re not interrupting something, are we?</em>”</p><p>It is Agatha’s plan to talk with Rae so staying with her right now is exactly where she needs to be. Besides, what's the worst that could happen?</p><p>“I think I can manage a few hours with her.” </p><p>“<em>Thank you.</em>” Rio replies. “<em>You hear that, Rae?</em>”</p><p>“If I turn out dead, don’t cry at my funeral, mami.” Rae announces dramatically, finally grabbing her bag and climbing out of the car. She almost shoves Agatha aside in the process, despite being visibly weak.</p><p>“She already said her goodbyes.” Agatha mutters into the phone, watching Rae trudge toward the front door, probably deeming inspiration from a doomed Victorian child.</p><p>“<em>I’ll be quick.</em>” Rio says. “<em>I’m about twenty minutes from Northview. I just have to drop something, then I’ll drive straight back. Are you sure you can handle her while I’m away?</em>”</p><p>Agatha snorts. It’s a sixteen-year-old kid. Yes, a dramatic one. Yes, currently febrile and feral. But still.. a kid.</p><p><em>Her</em> kid.</p><p>“I’ll feed her and give her medication.” Agatha purses her lips. “How hard can that be?”</p><p>Rae, halfway up the path, turns around after hearing it. “Famous last words.”</p><p>Agatha waves her away. “I’ll meet you inside and I will prove you wrong.”</p><p>Agatha regrets her confidence approximately thirty seconds after the front door closes behind them.</p><p>Rae drops her bag on the floor, kicks off her shoes with all the grace of a toddler, and immediately collapses onto the nearest couch.</p><p>“I’m dying.” Rae announces.</p><p>“You’re young and full of life.” Agatha clasps a hand over her mouth. “Don’t leave us too soon, <em>oh darling</em> Rae!”</p><p>“You’re making me more sick.” Rae glares at her as she stretches her feet. “Now my bones hurt.”</p><p>“You’re sixteen.”</p><p>“That doesn’t make me immortal.”</p><p>Agatha breathes through her nose and looks around the living room. It’s clean, which suggests the presence of a housekeeper or perhaps someone who stress-cleans when she’s worried. Everything is neutral, calm, and has soft edges everywhere. </p><p>Agatha will also dissect the interior and the picture frames hanging on a wall some other time, should she be invited back in. If not, well.. that seems to be a good conversation starter.</p><p>“Alright.” Agatha claps her hand, obviously getting the inspiration from Lilia. “Shoes are off. Couch is contaminated. What’s the medicine situation?”</p><p>Rae doesn’t answer.</p><p>“Rae.”</p><p>“I’m conserving energy.” Rae murmurs, eyes closed.</p><p>Agatha waits exactly three seconds. “Where’s your medicine?”</p><p>Rae groans as she picks up a pillow to cover her face. <em>Okay, copied.</em> She's of no help.</p><p>Agatha makes herself at home by following a hallway which leads to the kitchen. She begins opening cabinets like she knows what she’s doing. <em>She does not. </em></p><p>So far she finds three types of tea, a collection of expensive looking knives, spices she can’t pronounce, and exactly zero medicine.</p><p>She pulls out her phone.</p><blockquote><p><b>Agatha: </b>Where are the drugs?<br/>
<b>Agatha:</b> Be specific. Vague instructions stress me out.</p></blockquote><p>The reply comes almost immediately.</p><blockquote><p><b>Rio:</b> top cabinet next to the fridge on your left. it's in a white box with labels facing out.       <b>Rio:</b> you'll know it's rae’s coz the syrup container is bedazzled.. don't ask why<br/>
<b>Rio:</b> thank you for staying with her<br/>
<b>Rio:</b> really</p></blockquote><p>Agatha finds the box, grinning to herself while holding two types of syrup and a cup. One is for fever, the other for cough. Looks like Rae is not capable of swallowing a tablet indeed. That's another one to her arsenal.</p><p>She holds her phone with one hand as she read the last text for a beat longer than necessary, then types:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> We’re bonding.<br/>
<strong>Agatha:</strong> Who knows? She might let me braid her hair later or ask for a bedtime story.</p></blockquote><p>She grabs a glass and pours water, bringing the medicine back to the living room by putting it all on top of a plate.</p><p>“Sit up.” She instructs, placing the stuff on a coffee table in front of Rae as she starts to open the bottle while reading what's written on it.</p><p>Rae removes the pillow from her face as she squints. “Do you even know how much to give me?”</p><p>“The recommended amount.”</p><p>“That's not the answer I’m looking for.”</p><p>“You’re not five.”</p><p>“I was once.” Rae grumbles, finally sitting up.</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes, reads the instructions one last time, then pours the exact amount into the cup. No room for error.</p><p>She hands it to Rae right away. “Want a lollipop in case it tastes like shit?”</p><p>“Shut up.” Rae hisses at her, knocking it back in one go and immediately reaching for the glass of water herself.</p><p>Agatha watches her wince. Without a word, she grabs a napkin from the table and hands it over, then leans back against the couch.</p><p>“Blanket.” Rae adds.</p><p>Agatha looks around and finds one folded neatly over the arm of a chair. </p><p>“Let me—”</p><p>“No.” Rae takes it from her grip as she wraps herself up like a burrito and sighs. “My mami does this <em>better</em>.”</p><p>Agatha feels that one. “I’m sure she does..” She whispers.</p><p>There’s silence for a few minutes. Rae closes her eyes as Agatha watches her from across the couch, her foot bouncing nonstop.</p><p>She doesn’t relax. She <em>can’t</em>.</p><p>She stands and carefully checks Rae’s forehead with the back of her hand. Too hot. She withdraws like she’s been burned.</p><p>She texts again.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> She's still burning.<br/>
<strong>Agatha:</strong> How hot is too hot?</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> thermometer’s in the drawer underneath the tv<br/>
<strong>Rio:</strong> it's the blue one<br/>
<strong>Rio:</strong> don’t panic</p></blockquote><p>Agatha resents that last part deeply.</p><p>She isn’t panicking. She refuses to. Still, the worry settles in persistently, even if this is probably routine to Rio—another one of Rae’s episodes, another fever that never comes alone.</p><p>Agatha finds the thermometer and wakes Rae carefully. She shows it to her first. Rae barely protests as Agatha slips it under her tongue, too tired to argue.</p><p>“Don’t bite it.” Agatha warns.</p><p>“I know what to do.” Rae protests. “I'm not a child.”</p><p>They wait, neither of them talking to one another.</p><p>Eventually it beeps as Agatha takes it from Rae, reads it, frowns, then reads it again.</p><p>That’s.. higher than she expected.</p><p>Her phone buzzes almost immediately l</p><blockquote><p><strong>Rio:</strong> what does it say?</p></blockquote><p>Agatha hesitates before typing the results.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> It should be fine.<br/>
<strong>Agatha:</strong> I think? It's on the higher end but it should be manageable.</p></blockquote><p>There’s a pause this time.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Rio:</strong> okay<br/>
<strong>Rio:</strong> that’s okay<br/>
<strong>Rio:</strong> give her water, keep her cool<br/>
<strong>Rio:</strong> you’re doing great</p></blockquote><p>Agatha stares at the screen.</p><p>She is <em>not</em> doing great. She is standing in another woman’s living room, hovering over a child who looks too small under a blanket, feeling guilt crawling up her spine for not knowing what else to do.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> When do I take her to the hospital?</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> if it gets worse</p><p><strong>Agatha</strong>: How am I supposed to know if it’s getting worse?</p></blockquote><p>Rae shifts on the couch and starts coughing. She hadn’t been lying earlier. The cough really does come later.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> She’s coughing now.<br/>
<strong>Agatha:</strong> Is she gonna be vomiting next?</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> hopefully not<br/>
<strong>Rio:</strong> cough syrup is in the red bottle. 3 ml</p></blockquote><p>Agatha does what she’s told and measures the dose carefully. She shakes Rae gently by the shoulders.</p><p>“One more.”</p><p>Rae squints at the cup. “That’s disgusting.”</p><p>“Drink it anyway.”</p><p>“You’re bossy.”</p><p>“You’re sick.”</p><p>Rae drinks it and immediately gags. “I hate this.”</p><p>Agatha watches her swallow. Watches the faint tremor in her hands. It’s barely there yet she doesn’t miss it.</p><p>“Do you want your lollipop now?” Agatha asks.</p><p>Rae glares at her, then turns onto her side and slumps back down instead.</p><p>As comfortable as the couch is, Agatha’s concern Rae might strain her back.</p><p>“You should move to your room.” She suggests. “You’ll sleep better in your bed.”</p><p>Rae coughs once, dry and stubborn. “No. I like it here.”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to argue, then stops. She studies Rae for a second longer than necessary.</p><p>“Fine.” She resigns. “But if you wake up miserable, I’m saying I told you so.”</p><p>Rae mumbles something that might be agreement.. or it might just be exhaustion.</p><p>Agatha stays where she is anyway.</p><p>The house is quiet now. The kind of quiet that makes Agatha hyperaware of everything. Every breath Rae takes, every tick of the clock, every second Rio isn’t here.</p><p>She texts again.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> She’s asleep.</p><p><strong>Rio:</strong> that’s good<br/>
<strong>Rio:</strong> i’m stuck in traffic<br/>
<strong>Rio:</strong> but i promise i should be there soon</p></blockquote><p>Agatha doesn’t respond right away.</p><p>She looks at Rae. Really looks at her. The curve of her cheek. The stubborn set of her mouth even in sleep. The way she clutches the blanket like it might leave her.</p><p>Agatha presses her lips together.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Agatha:</strong> Hurry.<br/>
<strong>Agatha:</strong> She pretends she’s tough but she’s not fooling anyone.</p></blockquote><p>Three dots appear almost instantly.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Rio:</strong> neither are you</p></blockquote><p>Agatha scoffs, but she doesn’t deny it.</p><p>She doesn’t realize she’s drifted off too until her name pulls her back, faint and unsteady, like it’s coming from underwater.</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>?”</p><p>“Mhmm?” The sound leaves her before she’s fully awake.</p><p>She pushes herself up immediately, the couch protesting beneath her. For a split second she’s disoriented. Where she is, whose house this is—then she’s already moving, crossing the short distance to Rae without thinking.</p><p>Agatha presses the back of her hand to Rae’s forehead.</p><p>She freezes.</p><p>It could be wishful thinking but Rae feels cooler.. <em>somehow</em>. Not normal yet, but better than before.</p><p>Rae whispers something, the words slurring together.</p><p>Agatha leans closer. “What was that?”</p><p>“I said—” Rae opens her eyes briefly, her own blues meeting Agatha’s. “<em>Don’t leave me here.</em>”</p><p>Something in Agatha’s chest tightens.</p><p>“I won’t.” She answers without hesitation.</p><p>It’s not a promise she thinks about. It just comes out naturally.</p><p>Rae’s eyelids flutter. She exhales, the tension in her shoulders easing like that was all she needed to hear. Agatha pulls the blanket higher, careful not to wake her fully, tucking it over her chest.</p><p>Rae doesn’t protest. She lets it happen.</p><p>Agatha lingers there longer than necessary, hand still resting lightly on the blanket, feeling the rise and fall of Rae’s breathing. Counting it. Measuring it. Making sure it stays steady.</p><p>She tells herself it’s just being responsible. Just watching over a sick kid until her mami gets back.</p><p>But Agatha stays close, even after Rae slips fully back into sleep. She doesn’t move far, doesn’t let herself relax completely either.</p><p>And if Rae wakes later—confused, feverish, or afraid.. Agatha will still be there. She would stay the night if she has to, just to prove to the kid that she didn’t leave. That she <em>won’t</em>.</p><p>Not again.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
<p>Agatha jolts from sleep by a crack of thunder rolling through the house.</p><p>She’s still disoriented as she squints, clarity rushing in the moment she realizes she isn’t in her room at Lilia’s. In fact, from what little she can make out in the dim light, she isn’t anywhere in Lilia’s house.</p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p>She turns her head immediately and finds Rae asleep on the couch beside her, a fever patch pressed to her forehead. Rae looks peaceful—disarmingly so, as if she isn’t capable of verbal attack when conscious.</p><p>Agatha pushes herself upright, and only then notices the blanket draped over her body. It definitely hadn’t been there before so in her half-awake state, the realization confuses her more than it should.</p><p>For a second, her gaze drifts to the wide windows, where rain hammers down hard enough to compete with the thunder. Typical Westview and its unpredictable weather. More often than not, it is sunny in the morning and it becomes borderline apocalyptic by nightfall.</p><p>She yawns and stretches quietly, folding the blanket before setting it aside and moving closer to Rae.</p><p>The kid is still in deep slumber, chest rising and falling steadily. Agatha rests a hand carefully against Rae’s arm where it’s slipped free of her own blanket and breathes in quiet relief when she feels only warmth, not heat.</p><p>She lingers a moment longer, her hand still resting lightly on Rae’s arm. Just in case.</p><p>“You’re awake.”</p><p>Agatha startles only slightly. She doesn’t know how long she’s been standing there when the voice sneaks from behind her, but she really shouldn’t be surprised to find Rio emerging from the kitchen hallway.</p><p>“Hi!” Rio says, that familiar tooth-gap smile soft and unguarded as she stops beside Agatha. “You were snoring. I didn’t want to wake you when I got here.”</p><p>Agatha lifts a brow. “I don’t snore.”</p><p>“Well then, that must’ve been Rae.” Rio shrugs, entirely too pleased with herself. “I made french onion soup. You should eat while it’s hot.”</p><p>Agatha’s gaze drifts from Rio to the rain streaking down the windows, then to the watch at her wrist. It’s already past seven. “How long was I asleep?” She asks.</p><p>“I got here around six.” Rio replies. “You were already out by then.”</p><p>Agatha sighs, rubbing a hand down her face. “Well. You’re here now, and Rae seems better.” She straightens. “I should get going.”</p><p>Rio’s smile fades just enough to be serious. “Not in these conditions, you’re not. It’s pouring out. The roads are slippery.”</p><p>Agatha scoffs. “I’ve driven through worse.”</p><p>“I’m sure you have,” Rio says gently. “That doesn’t mean I’m letting you.”</p><p>Agatha turns to her, scandalized. “I cannot possibly stay at somebody else’s house without permission. What would <em>my </em>father say?”</p><p>Rio laughs. “I’ll explain it to him kindly.”</p><p>“You say that with alarming confidence.”</p><p>“You know my charm’s a gift.”</p><p>Thunder rolls again, closer this time. </p><p>Rio softens. “Seriously. Please stay, at least until the rain dies down.”</p><p>Agatha hesitates. She doesn’t like imposing. She doesn’t like needing. <em>But</em> she remembers the promise she made and she really doesn’t want to break it.</p><p>“Fine.” Agatha mumbles at last. “But I’m not sleeping over.”</p><p>Rio’s smile turns victorious. “Of course not. The princess forts are not built yet, anyway.”</p><p>They move toward the kitchen together. Agatha pulls out her phone, typing a quick message to Lilia informing her of her whereabouts before slipping it back into her pocket.</p><p>Agatha sits at the dining table while Rio moves around the kitchen. She rests her chin in her hands, elbows planted, watching the other woman work. Rio moves easily in the space, it’s almost like a habit. Drawers opening without hesitation and pots set down with practiced certainty.</p><p>Agatha notes all of it. She always does.</p><p>“I’m surprised you don’t live in a castle.” She comments aloud.</p><p>Rio laughs. “We don’t. It’s just the two of us so if we lived in a castle, we’d probably lose each other for days.”</p><p>“Your house is beautiful.” Agatha compliments, eyes drifting to the arches and the warm tones. “The interior is very.. mediterranean.”</p><p>“Thank you.” Rio replies with a smile. “It’s still new, relatively. We moved here about three years ago.”</p><p>So that means there’s another place. Another version of home for Rae. “This isn’t Rae’s childhood house?”</p><p>“It’s not.”</p><p>Agatha tilts her head, suspicious. “Now, don’t tell me she grew up in a castle.”</p><p>Rio chuckles again. “I don’t think there are castles in Westview.”</p><p><em>Pity</em>, Agatha thinks. She’d have ruled one. She’d lead a fine monarchy—at least in theory. In practice, her sharp tongue and sour attitude would have the townsfolk chanting for her execution and have her head on a spike by morning before the crown even settled.</p><p>Rio sets two bowls of soup in the table. Steam curls upward, carrying the scent of onions and herbs.</p><p>“I drove to Northview for a supposed cooking convention. Panels, tastings, networking.. all that kinds of stuff.” Rio says casually, wiping her hands on a towel. “It’s an annual thing.”</p><p>“And yet,” Agatha notes mildly. “You’re here.”</p><p>Rio shrugs. “What’s a mother gotta do?”</p><p>One thing is certain: she’s a great mother to Rae. That was never in question. Agatha has a lifetime ahead of her to thank Rio for everything she’s done, especially for all the moments Agatha wasn’t there to do it herself.</p><p>She clears her throat. This isn’t the time to get mushy or sentimental. It must be the weather, or whatever excuse keeps her from sounding like a fool.</p><p>She moves a bowl closer to her as she takes a spoonful of soup. As usual, it’s perfect. When had Rio ever disappointed her with food?</p><p>“You didn’t have to come back.” Agatha mutters.</p><p>“I wanted to.” Rio replies simply. </p><p>“Do you really think I couldn’t take care of her on my own?”</p><p>“Oh, I know you can.” Rio says calmly, like she’s stating a fact. “I’m just afraid of the attitude you two will throw at each other. Someone needs to interfere and stand as referee, you know?”</p><p>Agatha rolls her eyes. That’s fair. She’s only considered being in the same proximity with sick and vulnerable Rae, who knew what kind of chaos they’d unleash once the kid feels better and goes back to her usual self.</p><p>She could almost hear the words Rae would utter to get under her skin, and she would, of course, respond in kind.</p><p>Rio occupies the chair in the middle after offering Agatha a glass of juice. “Do you have plans tonight?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Then maybe you should just stay.” Rio suggests. “I don’t think it will tame anytime soon.”</p><p>Thunder rolls again, rain drumming insistently against the windows. Agatha glances toward the hallway, where Rae sleeps soundly.</p><p>"But what about the princess forts?" She asks in sarcasm.</p><p>“Something to look forward to next time, then.” Rio's voice softens, almost faltering, as if she just realized how forward she sounded. “I mean.. if you want to. <em>Only</em> if you want to.”</p><p>Agatha keeps quiet, taking another sip of her soup. Rio on the other hand doesn’t want to settle on silence tonight, it seems.</p><p>“What do you usually do on your free nights here in town?” She asks, casual but curious. “Are there.. perhaps, I don’t know, dates?”</p><p>Agatha’s brow lifts slowly. <em>Ah.</em> So this is where this is going. “I limit myself to one woman only.” She deadpans. “Per area.”</p><p>Rio looks at her, openly amused. “And am I the <em>lucky </em>woman of Westview?”</p><p>“Bold of you to assume that..” Agatha stirs her soup with exaggerated focus.</p><p>She doesn’t have to confirm or deny anything. She doesn’t want to give Rio the satisfaction and the boasting rights.</p><p>“What about you, then?” Agatha questions her instead, glancing up. “Anyone keeping you busy outside of cooking and child-rearing?”</p><p>Agatha didn’t miss the way Rio flushed, nor that little habit she had of pressing her tongue against the side of her cheek.</p><p>“I’m too busy to date.” Rio shrugs. “The last serious relationship I was in didn’t last long.”</p><p>Agatha points an accusing utensil towards her direction. “Is that a <em>you</em> problem?”</p><p>Rio presses a hand to her chest, pretending to be offended. “Ouch.”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t look away. “Well?”</p><p>Rio laughs, shaking her head. “We just don’t share the same values.”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha settles back, staring at her over the rim of her spoon. <em>Sure.</em> “But surely, there are other women?” She doesn’t have to specify, Rio knows exactly what she means.</p><p>Rio nods. “Occasionally.” Then, catching Agatha’s judgy expression, she quickly adds, “I have needs too. I’m not a robot.”</p><p>She couldn’t argue with that. She understood, truly. Besides, no one should shame a woman for her desires. Sexual or otherwise, it’s not the 1700s.</p><p>After a beat, she speaks again. “Is it true Rae gets sick a lot?”</p><p>“She has a weak immune system.” Rio hesitates, then adds gently, “Did she maybe inherit that from you?”</p><p>Agatha recoils theatrically. “Don’t accuse me of weakness!” A pause. “…Yes.” She admits, quieter.</p><p>Rio laughs fondly. “I was just kidding.”</p><p>“I’m not.”</p><p>Agatha shifts in her seat. This is the part she usually avoids, the part where humor stops working.“Her other parent..” She starts, then stops.</p><p>Rio looks at her, attentive. “Yeah?”</p><p>“I don’t know her.” Agatha admits. “It was a one-night stand at a bar. There was too much alcohol and my hotel room was only a few minutes a way.” She shrugs. “I kicked her out first thing in the morning.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t interrupt.</p><p>“Female to female pregnancies are rare but the chances are never zero. Give it to me to be one of the lucky winners. When I found out I was pregnant..” Agatha continues, staring into her soup, “I remember thinking, I can only hope <em>my</em> child doesn’t inherit anything awful. Some hidden disease or genetic time bomb, per say.”</p><p>She laughs bitterly and adds, “Unfortunately, she got my immune system, so I suppose the universe has a sense of humor.”</p><p>Rio offers a small, reassuring smile. “Could be worse.” Then, “For what it’s worth, she definitely got her talents from you.”</p><p>Agatha snorts. “And her attitude.”</p><p>“Also you.” Rio agrees easily. “Definitely you.</p><p>She sighs, but there’s no real bite to it. “Apparently.”</p><p>“When the workshop is done..” Rio’s gaze is set at Agatha, hopeful in a way she’s clearly trying to disguise. “Uh—are you..?”</p><p>“Am I what?”</p><p>“Are you going back to where you live?”</p><p>“I’m from L.A.,” Agatha answers. “And for that question, I don’t know. Honestly.”</p><p>Because the truth is, it isn’t really her decision. It’s <em>Rae’s</em>.</p><p>She doesn’t know how she’s supposed to make it work—her job, the filming schedules, the fact that her entire life is anchored thousand miles away. Her residency is in L.A., her calendar is brutal and unyielding. Despite all that, the options forms anyway, stubborn and inconvenient should Rae want her to stay.</p><p><em>She’ll figure it out.</em></p><p>Rio nods slowly, like she understands more than Agatha’s said aloud. She opens her mouth again. “Do you want to—” She stops.</p><p>Footsteps sound from the hallway, soft but uneven. Both women turn at the same time.</p><p>Rae stands there, blanket draped around her shoulders. Her hair is a mess and her eyes are almost red. She looks smaller like this. Disoriented, less sharp-edged than usual.</p><p>“Mami..” Rae whispers, her voice hoarse as she shuffles forward.</p><p>Rio’s expression changes instantly. She stands and crosses the space in two steps, hands already out, guiding Rae into her arms.</p><p>“Hey,” Rio says softly. “Hey, I’ve got you.”</p><p>Agatha stays where she is, watching the way Rae leans into Rio without hesitation, the way Rio presses a kiss to her hair like it’s a routine. It probably is.</p><p>Rae blinks, then glances past Rio, eyes landing on Agatha. “You’re still here.”</p><p>Agatha reacts on instinct. The familiar armor slides neatly back into place as she raises a brow, feigning nonchalance. “You asked <em>me </em>to stay.”</p><p><em>I wanted to stay,</em> she didn't say.</p><p>Rae squints at her, suspicious even through the haze of fever and sleep. “Did I?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t miss a beat. “Does this come with mild amnesia, or is that just a bonus symptom?” She turns toward Rio, gesturing vaguely with her spoon. “You know, she even asked for a lullaby.”</p><p>Rio snorts before she can stop herself while Rae’s face immediately turns red. “I did <em>not</em>.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs lightly and takes another spoonful of soup, infuriatingly unbothered. “I’m pretty sure you did, hon.” She hums thoughtfully. “It’s a very moving request, actually. You said something about my <em>soothing presence, </em>so who am I to refuse such?”</p><p>Rae mutters something under her breath, rolling her eyes so hard it’s a miracle they don’t get stuck.</p><p>“Maybe you’ll remember when you’re more.. put together.”.</p><p>Rio steps in smoothly, placing a gentle hand at Rae’s back as she guides her toward the table. “You should eat now, my love.”</p><p>“I want to sleep more.” Rae complains, voice dragging.</p><p>“And you will.” Rio tells her calmly, already ladling soup into a bowl. “After you put something in your stomach.”</p><p>Rae opens her mouth to argue, then closes it again when Rio gives her <em>that</em> look. She has no choice but sigh dramatically and slump into the chair across from Agatha, with Rio settling neatly between them like a human buffer.</p><p>“Can I have cereal instead?” Rae tries.</p><p>“No.” Rio replies without missing a beat. “You eat what’s served to you.”</p><p>“<em>Ohhh</em>!” Agatha claps once, delighted. “I didn’t know you could be stern.”</p><p>Rio glances at her. “Do you know my daughter?</p><p>Agatha shakes her head, considering. “I’m beginning to.”</p><p>“You have to be stern with this one.”</p><p>“Mami..” Rae groans. “I’m literally <em>right here</em>.”</p><p>“And still dramatic.” Rio says fondly, nudging the bowl toward her. “Eat.”</p><p>Rae pokes the soup suspiciously with her spoon. “I have no appetite.”</p><p>“Other children are starving, Rae.” Agatha supplies. “You should consider yourself lucky, with a roof on your head and food in your table, all that.”</p><p>Rae shoots her a look. “Remind me again, why are you talking and why are you still here?”</p><p>“My love, she can’t possibly drive in this condition.” Rio answers for her. “It’s pouring out.”</p><p>Rae sighs, then finally takes a bite. She chews slowly, clearly exhausted. “So she’s staying the night?”</p><p>Agatha shrugs. “I’ll leave once the rain stops”</p><p>“But, what if it doesn’t?” Rae stares at her, fully awake now. “Our guest room is not ready for guests.”</p><p>“It is, actually.” Rio butts in automatically.</p><p>“It’s <em>not</em>.” Her daughter insists, chin lifting.</p><p>Agatha blinks between them. <em>Interesting</em>. A domestic contradiction. </p><p>“Well,” She mutters lightly, batting her eyelashes. “I can always stay in your room, then.” She turns her head at Rae. “I can sing you more lullabies later, if you want more.”</p><p>Rae hisses. “I <em>never</em> asked you that!”</p><p>She didn’t. Agatha just finds it deeply enjoyable to pretend she did and tease her about it.</p><p>“You’re not welcome in <em>my</em> room.” Rae snaps. “Actually, you’re not even welcome in my wing.”</p><p>Agatha turns slowly to Rio, eyes wide with mock awe. “She has a <em>wing</em> of her own?”</p><p>Rio waves a dismissive hand. “No, she doesn’t.” She sighs. “Our rooms are on opposite ends of the house and she likes calling her side her ‘wing,’ even though it isn’t.” She looks at Rae. “Right?”</p><p>Rae crosses her arms, frowning. “It’s still my wing.” She insists. “And a certain someone is not welcome there.”</p><p>Agatha fakes a pout to match her expression. “So where, pray tell, am I supposed to sleep if the rain never stops?”</p><p>“That’s not my problem.” Rae says flatly.</p><p>“Is it not? I’m here in the first place because of <em>you</em>.”</p><p>“No.” Rae shoots back immediately, pointing an accusing finger. “You’re here because <em>you</em> insisted I was sick and <em>you </em>wanted to drive me home. I’m not responsible for your decisions.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her for a beat, then laughs. Not loudly, just a short, surprised sound. <em>God help her,</em> this kid really doesn’t know how to back down.</p><p>“Oh, I like you.” Agatha tells her. “You’re exhausting.”</p><p>“Mami,” Rae says, turning to Rio. “You’re not seriously considering this.”</p><p>Rio exhales slowly, the way she does when she’s already made up her mind but knows there’s going to be resistance. “It’s still raining.” She states. “I just checked and the forecast says it won’t stop for hours.”</p><p>“So?” Rae demands. “She can—”</p><p>“—Stay.” Rio finishes gently but firmly.</p><p>Rae’s jaw drops. “What?”</p><p>“She can stay.” Rio repeats, leaving no room for debate. “I’m not sending someone out into a storm.”</p><p>Rae looks between them, betrayed. “You’re really letting her stay?”</p><p>Agatha grins, pleased at the situation. “I think you should be more like <em>your </em>mami. She’s sensible.”</p><p>Rae glares at her. “You’re not welcome here.”</p><p>“But I’m already here.”</p><p>Rae opens her mouth again, clearly prepared to argue further, but Rio cuts her off with a warning “Raina.”</p><p>That hushes her. She’s not happy about it, but clearly it was effective.</p><p>Rae slumps back against her chair, mumbling, “This is unbelievable.”</p><p>Agatha leans slightly closer, lowering her voice conspiratorially. “For what it’s worth..” She whispers. “I think your wing sounds <em>very </em>exclusive.”</p><p>“Don’t talk to me.”</p><p>Agatha smiles, unoffended. “Good night to you too, hon.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Rio shakes her head without saying anything, unsure what to do with the endless banter the two women carry on in front of her.</p><p>They sit like that for a few more minutes. The rain is steady outside, thunder roaring occasionally. Rae eats slowly but steadily, leaning back in her chair, eyes half-lidded. Agatha finishes her own bowl and doesn’t immediately move away.</p><p>At some point, Rae’s head starts to dip.</p><p>“Hey.” Rio calls her attention. “Don’t fall asleep mid-spoon. You’ll hurt yourself.”</p><p>“I’m fine.” Rae mutters, pushing her bowl away. “Can I go back to bed now?”</p><p>Rio studies her the way only a parent can. Her eyes scanning, hand hovering, instinct doing a full systems check. “Do you feel better?”</p><p>“Yes.” Rae admits, then adds, “But my nose feels kinda stuck.”</p><p>Rio hums. “I’ll wake you up for another dose in about..” She glances and starts pressing something in her smart watch. “Four hours.”</p><p>Rae clutches her blanket like a shield and shuffles away down the hallway, shoulders slumped, footsteps dragging. She pauses once, just long enough to glance back.</p><p>Agatha raises two fingers in a lazy salute. “Sleep tight, <em>Your Highness of the East Wing.”</em></p><p>Rae didn't say anything more as she disappears into the second floor.</p><p>The house settles into a quieter vibe once she’s gone. The kitchen light feels warmer without Rae’s sharp commentary cutting through it.</p><p>“Well..” Agatha breaks the silence. “At least she won’t be sleeping on an empty stomach.”</p><p>Rio chuckles. She stands and starts clearing the bowls, so Agatha follows to help, but Rio waves her off.</p><p>“You’re a guest.” </p><p>“I don’t believe in that concept.” Agatha replies. “I believe in being useful, that’s just basic etiquette. And, that makes it less awkward.”</p><p>Rio glances at her, amused. “You don’t strike me as someone who feels awkward often.”</p><p>Agatha smirks. “I’m an Emmy winning actress, after all.”</p><p>They share a look. It was brief but charged, something unspoken lingering just beneath the surface. The rain punctuates it, like it’s in on the moment.</p><p>Rio breaks eye contact first, gesturing vaguely. “You can.. uh. You can sit. Or—actually.” She hesitates, then makes a decision. “Do you want to see something?”</p><p>Agatha arches a brow. “That depends. Is it incriminating?”</p><p>“Of course not.” Rio places the bowls in the dishwasher before leading Agatha back towards the living room.</p><p>The place is dimmer, lit mostly by a standing lamp in the corner and the faint glow of the solar lights outside. Rio stops at the huge wall that is covered in framed photographs. Some large, some small, and some clearly added over time without much concern for symmetry.</p><p>“I know it’s a lot.”</p><p>“I don’t think it’s ever a lot when it comes to pictures.”</p><p>Agatha steps closer, eyes moving slowly at each frame. Rae at maybe six, missing two front teeth, grinning with wild pride as she holds up a ribbon. Rae at ten, scowling in a soccer uniform. Rae older, thirteen maybe, wearing a ridiculous frilly costume.</p><p>Agatha points at it. “What is she supposed to be? Juliet?”</p><p>Rio laughs softly. “Community play. She insisted on joining and surprise, surprise! She gets the lead role.”</p><p>“Are you sure she insisted? She looks like she hates everyone.”</p><p>“She hated rehearsals, she thinks she’s too good for it. But she enjoyed and loved everything about the production.”</p><p>Agatha stares at the photo longer than she means to. Rae was onstage and is in mid-gesture, dramatic and alive in a way that twists something deep in her ribs.</p><p>“She was good.” Rio adds quietly. “She said she didn’t care if anyone came, then she looked for me in the crowd the entire time.”</p><p>They move along the wall. Rio in a chef’s coat, younger, standing in what looks like a bustling kitchen.</p><p>“Vegas.” Rio explains. “First head chef position for what, a year? I was terrified.”</p><p>“You don’t look it.”</p><p>“I was.” Rio smiles faintly. “I called Rae every night. Even when she was too young to understand half of what I said.”</p><p>Another photo, Rio and Rae on a beach, both sunburned with their hair a mess. Rae is laughing, unguarded.</p><p>“This is really nice.” She hates how thin it sounds.</p><p>Rio studies her, something perceptive in her gaze. “You okay?”</p><p>Agatha scoffs lightly. “I’m fine. Just—” She gestures vaguely. “You have a very full wall. It’s good to have something tangible as you look back at those memories.”</p><p>Rio smiles, but there’s understanding there. “You don’t?”</p><p>“Don’t what? Have a wall full of pictures?” Agatha laughs under her breath. “No, but I have a very respectable collection of professional headshots and awards.”</p><p>Rio’s lips curve. “That sounds curated.”</p><p>“It’s intentional.”</p><p>Silence stretches, comfortable but heavy. The rain grows louder again as both their eyes settle on the huge windows before them. “You really should stay.”</p><p>“Against a teenager’s will?”</p><p>“The rain’s not stopping.” Rio gestures towards the windows. </p><p>Agatha considers deflecting. Instead, she doesn’t. “You’re very insistent.”</p><p>“I am.” Rio admits. “When it matters.”</p><p>Their eyes lock, and Agatha could have sworn she can almost see a hint of restraint in those hazel doe eyes.</p><p>Agatha steps closer, just a fraction. “And if I say I don’t want to be an inconvenience?”</p><p>“Then I’ll tell you you’re not.”</p><p>“And if I say I don’t like owing people?”</p><p>“Then I’ll tell you,” Rio repeats more gently. “That this isn’t a debt.”</p><p>The yearning hits her then, a quiet ache for walls like this. For being known in fragments and moments. For <em>staying</em>.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha concedes “If you’re going to twist my arm with hospitality and emotional vulnerability—”</p><p>Rio chuckles. “Cruel, I know.”</p><p>Agatha meets her gaze, something softer slipping through the cracks of her armor. “I’ll stay.”</p><p>Rio’s smile lingers a second longer than it should be. “Good.”</p><p>Thunder rolls again, distant but approving.</p><p>Agatha looks back at the wall one more time, at the life she’s only just brushed against. Maybe, she thinks, some storms are worth waiting out.</p><p>Before leaving, Agatha asks Rio to wait. She pulls out her phone and quickly snaps a photo of Rae when she was a baby. <em>Something to keep,</em> she says, like it’s nothing.</p><p>Rio only smiles. “I can send you more,” She offers. “More photos of Rae, if you want.”</p><p>Of course she wants them.</p><p>After that, they take their conversation into the living room, voices lowering naturally as if the house itself asks for it.</p><p>They exchange various stories. Rio talks about Rae as a kid, how she once caught chicken pox from another kid at the park who looked perfectly healthy at the time, and how Rae has since declared playground slides a public health hazard. </p><p>“She’s paranoid, but at least she’s wise.”</p><p>“She refused to touch a slide for <em>years</em>.” Rio adds fondly. “Would only stare at them like they’d personally wronged her.”</p><p>Rio drifts from there into stories of her own—how she once spent a month in Australia as a guest chef, how the kitchen was brutal and brilliant and nothing like Westview. Agatha, predictably, demands an accent.</p><p>“Say something!” She insists. “Anything.”</p><p>“I didn’t pick one up.” Rio chuckles. “I swear.”</p><p>“What a waste of international travel.”</p><p>At one point Rio disappears into the kitchen and returns with tea, ceramic mugs warm against their palms as they settle on opposite ends of the couch. Agatha would’ve preferred something stronger, but she reminds herself she’s merely a guest—so tea it is.</p><p>She tells stories of her own. Set disasters, fellow actors who slid into her DMs, and one particular film where she had to wear a medieval wig so heavy she’s convinced it shaved years off her life.</p><p>“It was one of my most challenging roles.” She exaggerates. “And not because of the acting. I was excellent at that.”</p><p>“Of course you were.”</p><p>“The costumes were absurd!” Agatha continues, yawning mid-sentence. “Layers on layers. I’m surprised I didn’t collapse on camera.”</p><p>Rio leans her elbows on her knees, chin resting in her hands as she looks at her. “I should watch it.” She remarks. “I’ll check if I can catch the struggle in your eyes.”</p><p>Agatha yawns again, longer this time, and blinks like she’s been caught doing something embarrassing.</p><p>“Would you like to rest?” Rio asks. “It’s getting late anyway.”</p><p>“I’m <em>not</em> a grandmother.” </p><p>“Even young people sleep early, Agatha.”</p><p>Agatha hesitates, gaze drifting past the other woman, as if she’s measuring the weight of the night. “Can I really stay here?”</p><p>“Our guest room is always ready.” Rio declares, already standing. “I’ll get you fresh clothes and new underwear. They're unused, I promise.”</p><p>Agatha takes her hand after a beat, her grip steady. “Do you just keep unopened packs of underwear around for the women you bring home?”</p><p>Rio rolls her eyes as they begin to head upstairs. “I don’t bring women home.”</p><p>They climb the stairs side by side. The house is quiet in that way only large homes get at night. It’s surrounded by soft lighting, polished wood, and even more photographs lining the walls.</p><p>Agatha’s attention drifts to them despite herself. Rae at different ages. Rae in a white tutu. Rae missing a tooth. Rae laughing, arms around Rio’s waist. Rio holding a huge key outside Rayo del Sol. Rio’s candid shot while riding a bike. Rio and Rae with a few other people, more likely Rio’s family.</p><p><em>Lives lived</em>. A history she wasn’t part of.</p><p>“This is Rae’s side.” Rio explains as they pass a hallway. “That’s the wing she’s referring to.”</p><p>“It’s spacious.”</p><p>“My room’s on the other end.” Rio adds, opening a door to the left. “While this is the guest room.”</p><p>The room is immaculate. Fresh sheets and clean walls. Beside the bed stood a soft lamp casting warm light. It smells clean, faintly of lavender.</p><p>“Shame.” Agatha murmurs.</p><p>Rio pauses. “Shame why?”</p><p>Agatha lets her gaze travel deliberately from Rio’s face down to her hands, then back up. “Because a woman like you could get a lot of women.”</p><p>Rio’s breath catches, just barely. “Could.” She echoes.</p><p>“But you don’t.”</p><p>“I don’t.” Rio confirms. “I have a daughter. I won’t rotate people through her life.”</p><p>Agatha nods, something sincere breaking through the snark. “That’s rare.”</p><p>They stand there a moment too long. The air shifts. It was subtle but unmistakable. Agatha felt it and she knows Rio did too.</p><p>“Well..” Rio says finally, voice softer. “You should get some rest.”</p><p>Agatha steps closer without fully meaning to. Or maybe, she does. “Thank you.” She whispers. </p><p>“I should be the one thanking you for taking care of Rae earlier.” Rio smiles genuinely. “Please be comfortable. The rain should stop tomorrow.”</p><p>Their eyes hold for a second, neither moves. The space between them hums with unresolved tension.</p><p>She can feel Rio’s breath close to her—warm and hesitant, until suddenly it isn’t anymore.</p><p>“Okay, uh—” Rio rubs the back of her neck, already retreating, already losing ground. “I’ll go get the clothes so you can rest.”</p><p>“Sure.” Agatha says fast. Why did she respond <em>so</em> fast?</p><p>Rio leaves as soon as she can, pulling the door shut behind her with a soft click.</p><p>Agatha exhales, then she laughs a little unsteady.</p><p>She turns, arms folding across her chest as if that might contain the restless energy buzzing under her skin. The room feels smaller now. Or maybe it’s just her.</p><p>She hasn’t moved far when the door opens again.</p><p>Rio stands there, a folded stack of clothes in her arms and a small box on top. Pajamas. Towel. <em>Lingerie</em>?</p><p>Agatha stares at her accusingly. “You forgot something.”</p><p>Rio blinks. “I did?”</p><p>“Mhm.” Agatha’s smile is lazy, allmost knowing. “Your dramatic exit. You didn’t even hesitate at the door when you left, very unconvincing.”</p><p>“I—” Rio laughs under her breath. “I was trying to be respectful.”</p><p>“Oh, is that what we’re calling it?” Agatha straightens, taking a slow step closer. “Because from where I’m standing, it looked like panic.”</p><p>“That’s unfair.”</p><p>“Is it?” Agatha’s eyes flick briefly to the clothes, then back to Rio’s face. “You walked halfway down the hall before deciding you <em>had</em> to come back.”</p><p>Rio’s mouth opens, then closes. “I said I’m going to fetch the clothes. Of course I’m coming back.”</p><p>Agatha shrugs as she reaches out, plucks the box from the pile, and examines it quietly. Their fingers brush and Rio stills.</p><p>“You’re very composed for someone who claims she doesn’t bring women home.” Agatha murmurs.</p><p>Rio swallows. “And you’re very difficult for someone who’s supposed to be resting.”</p><p>“Well, that’s called talent.”</p><p>Agatha steps closer again—close enough now making the space between them tighten.</p><p>“You know..” She says in a low voice. “Most people would have kissed me by now.”</p><p>Rio’s breathe hitches. “Most people don’t say things like that.”</p><p>“Most people aren’t me.”</p><p>“<em>Agatha</em>.” Rio mentions her name in a way that is both a warning and an invitation all at once. Agatha hopes they're leaning in on the invitation more.</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“You’re teasing.”</p><p>“You noticed.”</p><p><em>And that’s it</em>. Whatever restraint Rio had left snaps clean through.</p><p>She sets the clothes down, then steps forward making Agatha move backward until her back is already brushing the wall. Rio braces one hand beside her head, caging her in without quite touching.</p><p>“You know, you don’t have to mention other women. No need for segues.” </p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha challenges.</p><p>“You can always just tell me.”</p><p>“Tell you what?”</p><p>Rio leans in, close enough that her breathing ghosts Agatha’s own skin. “That you <em>want </em>me.”</p><p>That made Agatha chuckle. “<em>Do I</em>?”</p><p>Rio smiles against her skin. “You made me ask you out the first time you saw me.” Her lips brush Agatha’s ear—barely there, but definitely intentional. “So yes. I’m fairly certain you do.”</p><p>Her other hand slides down Agatha’s side, slow and unhurried, resting at her hip like it belongs there. Agatha gasps shortly.</p><p>“You’re cocky.” She mutters.</p><p>“Am I?” Rio murmurs. “Or just paying attention?”</p><p>“No. Cocky." Agatha hisses as Rio’s hand ghosts down from her hips, lingering at the center of her pants, just brushing above the zipper.</p><p>“Cocky for someone you’ve been thinking about?” Rio asks, never breaking eye contact. Her fingers hover there, retreating just enough to be cruel. “I guess—”</p><p>“What.” Agatha’s thoughts go foggy. She catches Rio’s wrist and guides her hand right back where it had been. “Don’t,” She breathes. “Don’t be a tease.” The <em>irony</em> of it all.</p><p>Rio hums, pleased. “Huh.” She moves quickly then, unbuttoning Agatha’s pants with practiced ease. “Have you been—” She stops. “Oh. <em>Fuck</em>.”</p><p>They gasp in unison the moment Rio’s fingers make contact through Agatha’s core, already embarrassingly soaked, heat seeping through like she’s been waiting for Rio’s touch the entire night.</p><p>Rio’s fingers move in slow, deliberate circles over the thin fabric of Agatha’s underwear. “Satin?” Rio questions, amused.</p><p>“I have taste—<em>fuck, yes</em>.” Agatha hisses, her knees nearly giving out if not for the wall pressing cool against her back and Rio’s steady presence in front of her. “You seem.. practiced.”</p><p>Rio laughs softly, the sound equally warm and unbothered. “I don’t think you’d like me talking about other women right now.” Her fingers slip beneath the fabric as she parted Agatha’s labia. She does it in a way that is unhurried yet easy. <em>Too easy</em>. “Have you been wet this whole time?”</p><p>“No.” Agatha bristles at that, chin lifting even as her breathe stutters. She’s not <em>that </em>pathetic. Sure, it’s been a while, but she has principles.</p><p><em>The whole time</em> doesn’t equate to her anticipating Rio’s hands since they climbed the stairs. That’s beside the point.</p><p>She reaches for Rio’s wrist, guiding her back when those fingers attempt to retreat even a fraction. “Don’t you dare.”</p><p>Rio’s grin turns almost dangerous. “I wasn’t planning to.”</p><p>Agatha’s hands fly to Rio’s shoulders, gripping for balance as sensation floods her, overwhelming and immediate. “Don’t act like you don’t want this.”</p><p>“I never did.” Rio says honestly, panting. “I don’t think I ever have.”</p><p>“Yeah?” Agatha challenges, catching her own breathe.</p><p>“Yeah.” Rio pushes a finger inside, slow and steady, letting Agatha feel everything. “God.. you’re so pretty like this.”</p><p>Agatha lets out a sound that’s half a curse, half a plea. She tries to suppress her moans but she couldn’t, while Rio has to bite back her own reaction—bite back the way the noise Agatha made go straight through her.</p><p>Her hand cradles the back of Agatha’s head now, protective even as she keeps her pace unrelenting. “What is it, babe?” Rio teases gently, adding another finger as she pumps relentlessly. “Use your words.”</p><p>“Fuck you—<em>oh</em>.” Agatha’s head tips back and thankfully it cushions against Rio's palms, her voice shattered. “Right there. Just—<em>yes</em>.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t stop. If anything, she focuses, like she’s found something precious and intends to ruin Agatha with it. When her palm brushes just right along her clit, Agatha moans sharply, head knocking back once more.</p><p>“Easy,” Rio murmurs, lips brushing Agatha’s ear. “I’ve got you.”</p><p>Then, softer, teasing: “Am I better than everyone else?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t answer—well, she can’t because everything crests at once, her vision washing white as she rides her orgasm the same moment a sharp chime cuts through the air.</p><p><em>Rio’s smart watch. </em>The freaking alarm she set hours prior.</p><p>She freezes for half a second before withdrawing, carefully adjusting Agatha’s clothes like she hadn’t just undone her entirely.</p><p>“That’s my cue.” Rio utters gently, helping Agatha stand properly, fixing her zipper and smoothing her waistband. “Medication time.”</p><p>Agatha blinks, still dazed. “What the <em>hell</em> was that?”</p><p>“You asked me.” Rio shrugs casually. She lifts her fingers, still glistening with Agatha’s own slick and without breaking eye contact, she licks them clean. “<em>You</em> taste good.”</p><p>Agatha has absolutely no response for that.</p><p>She’s just been pressed against a wall in a guest room by the woman she flirts with who turns out to be the adoptive mother of the daughter she gave up. The daughter in question is also currently asleep somewhere in this very house.</p><p>What. Has. She. Done.</p><p>“I need to take care of Rae.” Rio announces, fixing her hair. “You should rest.”</p><p>“<em>Rest?</em>” Agatha scoffs weakly.</p><p>Rio leans in, presses a quick kiss to her cheek, devastating in its simplicity. “Don’t be greedy.” She has a sheepish smile and unapologetic eyes.</p><p>She gives Agatha one last look before she finally walks away, door clicking shut behind her for the second time tonight.</p><p>Agatha stays there, back against the wall, heart racing, body still humming.</p><p>“That asshole.” She whispers to particularly no one but herself.</p><p>Who knew gentle, sweet Rio had <em>that</em> in her?</p><p>And worse—who knew Agatha would <em>like </em>it? Enjoy it? <em>Love </em>it?</p><p>She sighs, straightens her posture, and heads straight to the bathroom. She cleans up, composes herself, does what she always does, even in someone else’s house. </p><p>She’s change into the clothes Rio provided which is an oversized Coldplay shirt and a black pajama. She finally crawls into bed as her phone buz in her hand, a notification lights the screen.</p><blockquote><p><b>Rio:</b> you’re absolutely right</p></blockquote><p>Agatha arches a brow.</p><blockquote><p><b>Agatha:</b> I know. I always am.<br/><b>Agatha:</b> About what this time?</p></blockquote><p>The typing bubble appears instantly.</p><blockquote><p><b>Rio:</b> your real moan is <em>so</em> much better than your fake one<br/><b>Rio:</b> ❤️</p></blockquote><p>Agatha groans at the message and tosses her phone onto the empty space beside her. She grabs and pulls a pillow over her face and screams into it, quiet and contained, like everything else she refuses to say out loud.</p>

<p>“Agatha. Agatha. Agaaaathaaaa!”</p><p>Agatha drags herself out of the void to the deeply unpleasant sensation of cold hands shaking her shoulders relentlessly.</p><p>“What..” She croaks, which comes out more like a haunted wheeze buried below than a word. “Do you want?”</p><p>Her eyes blink open. The first thing she sees is Rae, her sunburned cheeks flushed with health as contrast to yesterday which she’d been pale and fragile. Today she looks absolutely thriving. Good for her,</p><p>“You are impossible to wake up.” Rae says before her, scowling. “Mami sent me to kick you out since she’s too timid to do it herself, which I don’t quite understand considering this is our own house. Anyway, your rent’s due. You gotta leave now or I might have to call security.”</p><p>That was a lie and they both know that. Agatha thinks of a perfect response however, when she attempts to speak, nothing happens.</p><p>She tries again. Still nothing.</p><p>Her throat feels as though it’s been sandblasted. Her body aches in that deep, unreasonable way that suggests she did not, in fact, rest—even if she technically slept.</p><p><em>Oh</em>.</p><p>Oh no.</p><p>Rae tilts her head, squinting upon noticing it. “What’s wrong with you?”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth, closes it, then gestures vaguely at her face as if that should explain everything. “Get me—” Her voice cracks violently. “—Get me a napkin.” She can already feel the pressure building behind her nose.</p><p>Rae folds her arms in resistance. “Don’t tell me what to do in my own house.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her, incredulous. “I am actively dying, can't you see?”</p><p>“Well, you can walk.”</p><p>“I am choosing not to.” Agatha snaps, clapping a hand over her nose as the first warning tickle hits. “Get me a napkin. Now.”</p><p>Rae mutters a complaint under breath but she bolts anyway, sprinting to the bathroom and shoving an entire pack of napkins into Agatha’s chest.</p><p>Agatha barely has time to grab one before she sneezes into it aggresively. Then again. And again.</p><p>“Jesus Christ.” Rae shudders, backing away in slow horror. “That was disgusting.”</p><p>“You’re disgusting!” Agatha fumbles for another napkin, eyes watering. “You—hatchh’—you infected me!”</p><p>“I did not!” Rae protests, already retreating toward the door. “Okay, maybe I did, but that’s not my fault. You’re geriatric and old people get it easily!”</p><p>“I am not old!” Agatha sneezes again, louder this time. “You are contagious!”</p><p>“That’s not how that works!”</p><p>Agatha makes a grab for another napkin and misses, groaning as she bends forward. “I let you breathe near me and this is what I get.”</p><p>Rae is now fully at the doorway, one foot already in the hall. “Yeah, no. I am not getting sick again. Mami!”</p><p>She takes off down the hall at full volume. “MAMI! AGATHA CAUGHT A FLU! YOU SHOULD GET HER OUT OF THE HOUSE IMMEDIATELY BEFORE SHE TRANSMITS HER VIRUS TO US ALL!”</p><p>Agatha slumps back against the pillows, surrounded by crumpled napkins, congested and furious. “<em>That little shit</em>.” She mutters thickly, blowing her nose yet again with unnecessary violence.</p><p>Somewhere down the hall, she hears Rio’s voice and her impending footsteps. Agatha squeezes her eyes shut in frustration, it’s simply too early to deal with all this.</p><p>Is this what she gets for fooling around? An orgasm from last night <em>and</em> the plague the morning after? Yeah, the universe absolutely hates her.</p><p>Agatha discerns the sound Rio makes before she can see her. She keeps her eyes closed anyway, clutching a wad of napkins because dignity is already gone and she refuses to lose whatever scraps of control she has left.</p><p>“Agatha?” Rio’s voice comes gently from the doorway. “Rae said you—oh.”</p><p>There’s a pause. Agatha can feel the assessment happening right there and then. She probably thinks Agatha’s some kind of loser who gets sick in someone else’s house, bundled halfway into borrowed blankets. She can’t blame Rio, but that’s gotta hurt her ego terribly.</p><p>“I’m fine.” Agatha says despite her unconvincing nasal voice.</p><p>She hears Rio stepping closer. Agatha cracks one eye open and sees the other woman standing there in a flowy black dress with her hair in its signature messy bun. Her expression is doing that infuriating thing where concern blurs with fondness. </p><p>“That doesn’t sound fine to me.”</p><p>“I said I’m fine, I’m not trying to sound fine but I assure you, I am fine.” Agatha hisses, then sneezes again. She groans into her hands in humiliation. “Damn it.”</p><p>Rio is already beside the bed, setting the mug she was holding down on the nightstand and reaching for the napkin box with practiced ease. “Okay. Breathe here.”</p><p>“I don’t need—” Agatha starts, but Rio presses it into her hand anyway.</p><p>Agatha blows her nose with all the bitterness of someone who knows exactly where this came from. “Your daughter infected me.” She accuses.</p><p>“You weren't lying when you said you had poor immune system..”</p><p>“Why would I lie about that?” Agatha scoffs, voice hoarse as she burrows deeper into the blankets. “This is not the kind of thing one lies about for attention. I suffer authentically.”</p><p>“You caught a cold in under twenty-four hours.”</p><p>“Your house is clearly hostile.” </p><p>Rio smiles despite herself. She presses the back of her fingers to Agatha’s forehead, cool against the heat radiating there. Agatha startles, more at the gentleness than the touch itself.</p><p>“You’re warm.” Rio announces her judgement.</p><p>“Don’t start diagnosing me.”</p><p>“That’s a fact.” Rio states and pulls back, picking up the mug again. “Have some tea. It’s just ginger and honey, but it might help your throat.”</p><p>Agatha eyes it suspiciously. “Is there anything stronger in it?”</p><p>“I don’t think you’re in the position to ask for gin and tonic.”</p><p>Agatha mimics Rio in a mocking way yet she takes the mug. Her hands are a little shaky, which she hates. She takes a cautious sip, sighing in relief the moment hot liquid reached her throat. </p><p>Rio makes herself comfortable by sitting on the edge of the bed, close enough that Agatha can feel the warmth of her thigh through the blankets. “How bad is it?”</p><p>Agatha holds the mug tightly as she slumps back against the pillows. “My insides are burning.”</p><p>“So.. bad.”</p><p>“Medium-bad.” Agatha corrects. “I’ve been worse.”</p><p>“Oh, I’m sure.” Rio nods. “You look very brave. Would you like a sticker for your bravery?”</p><p>Agatha snorts and grabs another tissue as Rio reaches over, adjusting the blanket around her shoulders without saying anything. It’s infuriatingly <em>sweet</em>. </p><p>“You should stay.” Rio suggests.</p><p>Agatha stiffens. “No.”</p><p>“That wasn’t a question.”</p><p>“It should have been.”</p><p>“You’re sick.”</p><p>“I’ve been sick before.”</p><p>“In your own home.”</p><p>Agatha opens her mouth to protest, but she sneezes instead.</p><p>Rio grins as if she’s won the argument. “Doctor’s orders.”</p><p>“I didn’t agree to a doctor.”</p><p>“Well, you’re in my house. I outrank you.” Rio smiles, but there’s something firmer underneath it now. “Agatha.”</p><p>She waits until Agatha looks at her. “Stay.” She repeats. “Even for a few hours, at least until you’re better to drive yourself back at Lilia’s.”</p><p>Agatha exhales sharply, irritation aimed squarely at her own body. “I can’t just impose.”</p><p>“You’re not imposing.”</p><p>“I already did enough of that.”</p><p>“You didn’t.” Rio’s voice softens.</p><p>Agatha doesn’t believe people easily when they tell her that. She never has. Words such as <em>you’re not a burde</em>n or <em>you’re not imposing </em>have always sounded decorative, something people say because they’re polite. It costs them nothing in the moment but in reality, do they really mean that?</p><p>Fuck Evanora Harkness, she thinks bitterly.</p><p>Her cunt of a mother had perfected the art of making space feel conditional. Love, too. She made Agatha feel like was something to be tolerated until she crossed an invisible line. She took up too much room, breathed too loudly, or wanted too much. She engraved in young Agatha’s mind that existing came with a debt she was always failing to pay back.</p><p>So she learned early how to pack herself smaller. She learned how to leave first and apologize without actually saying sorry.</p><p>Agatha swallows, jaw tightening. “I already spent so much time here. Frankly, I don’t want to be any more of an inconvenie—"</p><p>“Agatha.” Rio interrupts gently. “You showed up because you were worried about my kid and you stayed because she needed you. We owe you that. It doesn’t make you an inconvenience in our own house.”</p><p>They share a knowing look. Something easy settles between them, even with Agatha feeling like she’s held together by napkins and the matress.</p><p>“I’ll whip up some food.” Rio says.</p><p>“Must I eat?”</p><p>“You absolutely must.”</p><p>“You know I could just leave while you cook.”</p><p>“You’re not going anywhere.” Rio tells her. “For the time being, I mean..”</p><p>“You’re very bossy in your own house.” </p><p>“You noticed.” Rio smiles. “I learned from Rae.”</p><p>“That explains everything.”</p><p>Another sneeze sneaks up on Agatha. She barely has time to cover it and at this point, she really doesn’t care. Rio has already witnessed her sneeze one too many times so whatever dignity Agatha had left packed its bags awhile ago. She has nothing left to hide, unfortunately.</p><p>“I’ll get some sleep and stay until the food is ready.” Agatha verbalizes her decision.“Out of politeness, of course.”</p><p>Rio grins. “Yes, of course.”</p><p>“But then I’m leaving whether I’m still sneezing or not.”</p><p>“If I can’t hold you any longer than that then, okay.” Rio stands, smoothing her clothes. “Rest. I’ll be back once food is ready.”</p><p>Agatha nods quietly as Rio leaves the room. She can’t drive in this condition, so extra sleep even if it’s only a few minutes might actually help. And if she wakes up still feeling like absolute garbage, she can always Uber. Or call Kate. Or Lilia. Someone will come get her eventually for sure.</p><p>She settles back into the bed, adjusts the blankets, and lets her eyes fall shut. Rio went back quietly to give her medicine and other than that, she slept straight.</p><p>When Agatha wakes again, every muscle is still sore, but it’s different now. Not better in the fixed sense. Better in the less murderous one. She blinks up at the unfamiliar ceiling, takes a moment to orient herself.</p><p>Her nose is still stuffy, sinuses clogged enough to make breathing through them more of a suggestion than an option, but the pressure has eased. Her throat scratches when she swallows, yet it no longer feels like sandpaper. The tea surprisingly helped. </p><p>After a few minutes of silent contemplation, she drags herself upright, rubbing a hand down her face, and reaches for her phone out of sheer habit. The screen stays dark, which means it’s dead. That figures.</p><p>She considers hunting down a charger, then immediately decides she doesn’t want to bother Rio over something so minor so she lets the phone be. She sets it aside with a faint sigh, and resigns herself to being temporarily unreachable.</p><p>Agatha swings her legs over the side of the bed and stands, swaying a little before she catches herself on the dresser. With whatever strength she has left, she hauls herself to the bathroom to wash her face and brush her teeth. She’s still wearing Rio’s clothes, and at this point she’s accepted the truth that she will not be giving them back today.</p><p>Great. Another reason to see Rio again. It was as if yesterday she goes to return a food container, at least clothes are more reasonable than those.</p><p>She takes one last look at her reflection. She brushes her hair using her finger as she exits the room, intending to locate Rio and make some comments about being drugged with herbal tea.</p><p>That’s when she hears it.</p><p>At first, it’s just noise. Muffled sounds drifting down the hall. Agatha slows as she nears Rae’s wing, the sound growing clearer the closer she gets. One of the doors is wide open, light spilling out into the hallway. She can only assume that room belongs to Rae, who definitely is not alone.</p><p>Agatha pauses. She hears multiple voices now. Rae’s unmistakable, higher with excitement, and at least one other voice she can’t decipher. There’s giggling as a phone timer goes off.</p><p><em>Beep</em>.</p><p>“Okay stop, start again!”</p><p>Agatha frowns as the music blares out, loud and unmistakable.</p><p><em>Walk 'em like a dog</em></p><p><em>Walk 'em like a dog, sis, walk 'em like a dog</em></p><p>Agatha freezes, her soul leaving her body on the spot. She stares at the open door from where she stands, livid. “What,” She whispers hoarsely. “<em>The fuck</em>.”</p><p>Her brain does several things at once, none of them helpful. Why does Rae know that song? Why is it playing out loud? Is she making videos? Who is she with? What is happening in this household?</p><p>Agatha’s heart rate spikes. She spins on her heel and marches down the staircase, calling for, “RIO.”</p><p>She finds Rio in the kitchen, calmly chopping vegetables. “Rio,” Agatha says again, storming in. “We need to talk. Pronto.”</p><p>Rio looks up, startled. “You’re awake.”</p><p>“That is not the point.”</p><p>Rio sets the knife down carefully and glances her way with puzzled looks. “Did you feel worse?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Better?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Okay—”</p><p>“Your daughter is making videos. Tiktoks, I think.” Agatha blurts.</p><p>Rio blinks. “Yes.”</p><p>“With a friend.” Agatha adds, pointing emphatically back toward the hallway.</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“To Walk ’Em Like a Dog.”</p><p>Rio pauses and Agatha sees the way Rio tries to suppress her laughter. “…Okay.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her in disbelief. “That’s it? <em>Okay</em>?”</p><p>“What would you like me to do?” Rio shrugs. “Confiscate the phone? Ground her? Stage an intervention?”</p><p>“She’s sixteen!”</p><p>“Yes, I am aware.” Rio purses her lips. “Were they doing anything unsafe? Anything more dangerous than listening to that music?”</p><p>“I didn’t stay long enough to find out, obviously.” Agatha admits. “I value my sanity.”</p><p>Rio hides a smile by reaching for the pot on the stove. “They’re just making tiktoks.”</p><p>“To that song.”</p><p>Rio raises an eyebrow. “You seem very invested.”</p><p>“I am concerned.” Agatha insists. “Isn’t she too young for whatever, pray tell, she is doing?”</p><p>Rio turns to face her fully now. “You should take a sit.”</p><p>“I don’t—”</p><p>“Sit.” Rio repeats firmly, pulling out a chair.</p><p>Agatha hesitates but she does what she’s told anyway, folding her arms like a petulant cat.</p><p>Rio slides a glass of water toward her. “You’re still sick.”</p><p>“I am recovering.”</p><p>“Okay, if you say so.” Rio nods. “Rae’s friend is staying for a few hours. They’re supervised with doors open. No nonsense, although I should have to talk with her for using the sound you heard.”</p><p>Agatha eyes her. “You’re far too lax about this. I’d assume you’d be otherwise.”</p><p>“Nah, I trust my kid.” Rio says simply.</p><p>That lands heavier than Agatha expects. She looks away. “Well, I don’t trust the internet.”</p><p>“That’s fair.” Rio agrees. “I monitor her social media accounts so she doesn’t post or see anything inappropriate.”</p><p>Agatha sighs, rubbing her temple. “I thought she was.. I don’t know. Studying? Memorizing lines for fun? Rotting in bed?”</p><p>“She feels better. Besides, this is her version of fun. I just let her.” Rio finishes plating the soup and sets it down in front of Agatha with unmistakable finality. “Eat.”</p><p>“I’m not a child.” Agatha whispers, but she still picks up the spoon, taking one spoonful. </p><p>Rio watches her with arms crossed and a sheepish grin. “You know..” She begins, “For someone who keeps insisting she’s fine, you sure let me feed you a lot of soup.”</p><p>“I’m humoring you.” Agatha replies, sniffing. “For morale.”</p><p>“Mhm. Sure. That explains why you’re already halfway through the bowl?”</p><p>Agatha pauses mid-bite, scowls, then pointedly takes another spoonful. That action made Rio laugh. </p><p>“Who’s with Rae?” Agatha finally asks, squinting toward the hallway as if the answer might physically emerge from it. “Who is possibly with her that she’s making tiktoks to that sound with?”</p><p>“America.” Rio answers easily.</p><p>Agatha's forehead creases. “America.”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“The country?”</p><p>“The girl.”</p><p>“A girl..” Agatha repeats faintly.</p><p>“Uh-huh.” Rio smiles, completely unbothered, leaning her hip against the counter. “I think she’s courting Rae.”</p><p>Agatha’s soul almost left her body for the second time that day. “<em>COURTING WHAT?</em>” </p><p>Rio winces slightly. “Indoor voice.”</p><p>Agatha ignores her. “Rae.. she’s—is she really?” She gestures vaguely with both hands, words failing her. “She's into girls?”</p><p>Rio hums.“Yes.”</p><p>Whoever or whatever Rae ends up liking, Agatha knows, with a certainty that she’d accept and support it. </p><p>Rae’s femininity catches her off guard a little not because it’s wrong, but because it’s so intentional. However, Agatha doesn’t read it as a stereotype, she reads it as a choice. Rae knows who she is and she’s proud to know her daughter wears it comfortably.</p><p>Hearing that she likes girls barely registers as a shock. Agatha is just glad Rio takes it the same way, no questions asked as if it's the most simplest thing in the world.</p><p>“America lives close by. They’ve been friends since what? Grade school?” Rio supplies.</p><p>“She would..” </p><p>“She would what?”</p><p>“Be the kind of girl who pulls the slow-burn friends-to-lovers nonsense.” Agatha continues. “That’s Rae’s brand.”</p><p>Rio laughs, nodding. “It kind of is.”</p><p>“And Rae’s making her wait?”</p><p>“Absolutely.” Rio confirms. “Rae’s stubborn. I don’t know how long she’ll keep America in the ‘just friends’ zone, but the girl’s patient. Persistent, even.”</p><p>Agatha hums, thoughtful. “Good.”</p><p>Rio glances at her. “Good?”</p><p>“Yes. It does build character.” She pauses upon realizing something, “Hey, Rio?”</p><p>“Yes?”</p><p>“I’m not meddling..” Agatha says quickly, which is usually how you know she is. “But have you, I don’t know, had the talk with Rae?”</p><p>Rio considers her. “Which is?”</p><p>“The birds and the bees.” Agatha clarifies. “<em>Sex</em> talk.”</p><p>“Yes, I have, actually.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“She handled it like a champ.” Rio shrugs. “She asked smart questions and if I remember correctly, she only rolled her eyes at me twice.”</p><p>“That tracks.”</p><p>“I gave her options, resources, boundaries—all that stuff. She told me she values her first time and isn’t rushing into anything.”</p><p>Agatha narrows her eyes. “Really?”</p><p>“Really.” Rio says without hesitation. “I also take precautions. Just like I mentioned earlier, the door always stays open when she has someone over. I also track her location when we’re not together so that's an added bonus.”</p><p>“Hence the tiktok trauma.” Agatha sighs, dragging a hand down her face. “Honestly? I feel better.”</p><p>“Do you?”</p><p>“Yes. I’ve heard kids act out when they’re deprived.”</p><p>Her own mother has always defined sexual intimacy as sins so severe they might as well be murder. Such desires rot your soul and send you screaming into hell if you so much as thought about them for too long. Being told otherwise didn’t soften Agatha. In fact, it did the opposite.</p><p>It made her curious. She was reckless in the way only a person raised on fear can be. She had to learn about biology and her options through television or educational pamphlets she'd seen around.</p><p>Rio nods sympathetically. “My parents did the same to me when I was younger. They were very honest and thorough. They even scared me half to death with pregnancy horror stories.”</p><p>“And?”</p><p>“I didn’t lose my virginity until I reached my twenties.”</p><p>Agatha smirks. “So high school was just making out?”</p><p>“Pretty much.”</p><p>“I lost mine when I was seventeen.” Agatha shares. “Well, as far as someone else's fingers go.”</p><p>Right on cue, Rae appears in the kitchen with her mystery friend in tow.</p><p>America looks exactly like the kind of kid who never learned to shrink herself. She has dark hair and wears a worn leather jacket slung over a plain tee. She takes one look at Agatha, bundled in borrowed clothes—and stops dead.</p><p>“Agatha Harkness! Rae wasn't kidding when she said you're here.” The girl moves forward, her eyes wide with excitement. “Hi! I’m America Chavez, Rae’s friend.” </p><p>At least the kid has manners. Good for her.</p><p>“Hi. I’m Agatha.” She repeats, as if the name hasn’t already detonated in the room.</p><p>“It’s really nice to meet you.” America’s grin flickers into something softer. “My mother is a huge fan of your filmography. We watch some of them together.”</p><p>“My thank you, hon.” Agatha’s flattered. “Would you like an autograph for your mother?”</p><p>Rae watches this exchange with visible dread and speaks before America does. “Why are you still here?” She asks flatly, eyes on Agatha. </p><p>Agatha scoffs, turning to her now. “Eager much?”</p><p>“You were supposed to leave.” Rae presses. “Like, hours ago.”</p><p>Rio, from the counter, offers gently, “She wasn’t feeling well, my love.”</p><p>“I’m feeling better now.” Agatha corrects reflexively because she refuses to be perceived as weak by a sixteen-year-old who inherited her attitude.</p><p>America glances between them as if she’s watching a tennis match. “You guys talk like—”</p><p>“Don’t finish that sentence,” Rae warns her.</p><p>Agatha bats her eyelashes in a mocking way. “Like family?”</p><p>Rae’s glare could peel paint. “No.”</p><p>America chuckles anyway, hands shoved into her jacket pockets. She looks comfortable here and she seems nice. That's a good thing. Agatha doesn't know what she knows about Rae being her biological daughter but if Rae did tell her, then that means she trusts her friend enough.</p><p>Rae turns toward the pantry. “We’re just grabbing snacks.”</p><p>“Disappointing.” Agatha mutters. “I was looking forward to spending more time with you.”</p><p>The teens disappear down the short hallway, voices trailing behind them. Rio silently watches her from across the kitchen, shrugging to herself.</p><p>A few minutes later, footsteps return alongside the crinkle of snack wrappers. Rae reappears with a bag of chips under one arm while America is balancing a handful of chocolate bars and a few canned drinks.</p><p>“Okay,” Rae stops short again. “You’re still here. <em>Why</em>?”</p><p>Agatha doesn’t even look up. “I might just stay another night.Who knows?”</p><p>“Please don't.” Rae frowns.</p><p>America speaks, getting herself in the middle. “It was really nice meeting you.”</p><p>Agatha meets her gaze. “Be a good influence to her, I think she really needs a role model.”</p><p>America nods without hesitation. “Always.”</p><p>“Stop talking to her.” Rae groans once more.</p><p>“Truly, your hospitality is unmatched.”</p><p>Rae shoots her a look. “You’re annoying.”</p><p>“And you’re a kid.” Agatha shoots back easily. “We all have our burdens.”</p><p>“Raina.” Rio says, calm but unmistakably firm. She doesn’t raise her voice, she never needs to. “That’s enough. That’s not how we talk to guests.”</p><p>Rae mutters something under her breath that sounds suspiciously like <em>whatever</em>. She adjusts the grip on the snacks and jerks her head toward the hallway. “Come on.”</p><p>America hesitates for half a second, glancing back with an apologetic little smile before following Rae. Their footsteps fade as they head back up to Rae’s wing.</p><p>Clearly Rae's not in the mood for a conversation so Agatha will try again next time. </p><p>Agatha watches them go, then clicks her tongue. “She’s delightful.”</p><p>Rio sighs. “I’m sorry for that. I’ll make sure to speak with her.”</p><p>Agatha doesn't reply as she shifts in her seat, rolls her shoulders once, testing. The ache in her muscles is still there but it's no longer unbearable. Additionally, her head feels clearer. Her nose is still stuffy to no one's surprise, but she’s survived worse on far less.</p><p>“I’m better.” Agatha says, already pushing herself upright. “I really should leave now.”</p><p>Rio doesn’t respond right away. She steps closer instead, hand pressing gently to Agatha’s forehead before Agatha can protest.</p><p>Agatha freezes. “I didn’t consent to this examination.”</p><p>“Hush. Humor me.” Her hand is grounding as she frowns just a little. “You’re still hot.”</p><p>“I’m always hot. I maintain my figure through an active lifestyle and curated diet.”</p><p>“You are, but that's not the kind of hot I was referring to.” Rio smiles.  “I can drive you home.”</p><p>Agatha waves the suggestion off immediately. “No. Absolutely not.”</p><p>“Agatha—”</p><p>“I can drive.” She insists. “I’m not incapacitated and you’ve already done more than enough.”</p><p>Rio studies her, searching for cracks. “You’re sure?”</p><p>Agatha meets her gaze, steady. “I am.”</p><p>A beat passes. Then Rio nods, reluctantly. “Alright then.”</p><p>She gathers her things from the guestroom quickly without lingering any second longer. Downstairs, Rio is waiting by the door. They step outside together, the rain now a soft mist that clings to the environment. Westview feels almost polite this morning in contrast to the previous night.</p><p>Rio walks her to the car parked in the garage, keeping pace without crowding her. Agatha reaches the door, one hand on the handle, and feels Rio’s presence beside her. Close enough to feel, distant enough that she can pretend she isn’t noticing.</p><p>“Well,” Agatha breaks the ice. “This is where you tell me to text you when I get home.”</p><p>Rio’s amusement becomes evident. “Text me when you get home.”</p><p>“Predictable.”</p><p>“And you’ll do it anyway.” Rio doesn’t hesitate this time around.</p><p>She steps in, closes the distance, and presses a gentle peck to Agatha’s cheek. It’s enough to make Agatha’s breathing catch in the most irritating way.</p><p>Rio pulls back just far enough to look at her. “Drive safe.”</p><p>Agatha stares at her for a beat too long, then scoffs, flustered and annoyed at herself for it. “You know..” She says, opening the car door. “For someone so gentle, you’re alarmingly good at following orders.”</p><p>Rio winks. “Funny. I was thinking the same thing about you.”</p><p>Agatha pauses, one foot already inside the car. She glances back over her shoulder, smirking dangerously. </p><p>“Oh?” She drawls. “Careful, Chef. Keep that up and people might get the wrong idea.”</p><p>Rio just lifts her brows, curious “What idea would that be?”</p><p>“That I tell you to jump..” Agatha grins, “And you’ll say how high.”</p><p>Rio taps the roof of the car once, a playful smile on her lips. “Text me.” She reiterates, closing the door herself.</p><p>Agatha smirks, leaning slightly out of the window as she starts the engine. “Thanks for the shelter, the food, and for putting up with me being a germ factory.”</p><p>“Anytime.” Rio replies, shrugging as if it’s no big deal, though the glint in her eyes says otherwise.</p><p>Agatha rolls the window up just a bit, her voice low. “Don’t let it get to your head.”</p><p>Rio laughs. “Too late.”</p><p>Agatha shakes her head with a small, reluctant grin and pulls out of the garage. She glances in the rearview mirror, catching Rio’s wave one last time. </p><p>Somehow, she already knows she has a reason to come back or see the other woman soon. She’s still wearing Rio’s clothes, and she’s definitely not ready to stop thinking about her until then.</p>
